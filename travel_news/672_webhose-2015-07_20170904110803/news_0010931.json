Soon you’ll be settling into your en-suite cabin and exploring the cruise ferry’s facilities. Perhaps you’ll stop for a coffee in the café or bar and plan the four-week winter sun holiday that awaits, using the free Wi-Fi to check the weather. Whether you are continuing on to the south of Spain, Portugal or France, the crossing on your modern, well-equipped Brittany Ferries ship will be relaxing and rewarding. After all, the company won the Best Cross-Channel Ferry accolade in the 2014 Telegraph Travel Awards. Award-winning facilities on board The journey from Plymouth to Santander takes just 20 hours, or 24 hours from Portsmouth to either Santander or Bilbao. That gives plenty of time to enjoy all the facilities, which are more like those of a cruise ship than a ferry. These vary a little depending on the ship, but you can expect to find a restaurant serving fine French and international cuisine, with the likes of poached sole in Sauternes sauce and tournedos of beef with green peppercorn sauce on the menu. Most of the produce used in the kitchen is sourced from Brittany. If you prefer a buffet, there will be a generous selection awaiting which might include treats such as organic Scottish salmon, quail supreme with grapes and delicious French cheeses. If you fancy a full English breakfast, a light meal, a glass of wine or a beer, head for the self-service restaurant, which is open early until late. After dinner, you could enjoy one of the latest movies in the cinema or drop into the bar – where there may be live entertainment – for a nightcap before retiring to your comfortable cabin. First-class food: on board Brittany Ferries most of the produce is sourced from Brittany Sit back and relax Cabins on board are en suite and also come with bedding, towels and toiletries. There’s a choice of grades – you could treat yourself to Commodore or Deluxe class, which have tea-making facilities, TV with DVD player and complimentary breakfast and hot and cold drinks served in your cabin. Some ferries even offer pet-friendly cabins, and dedicated exercise areas (otherwise, there are dedicated kennels). The next morning, you’re sure to want to browse the shops on board. These sell a wide choice of wines, spirits, tobacco, perfumes, fashion, toys and gifts from major brands at great prices. There’s a particularly good selection of wines chosen by experts from all the key French regions, plus a range of world wines. It’s all so much more enjoyable than travelling by air, and on arrival in Spain or France, you simply drive off on your extended winter sun adventure. With your own vehicle, you can take as much luggage as you like, so you won’t be pining for those golf clubs, bikes or tennis rackets when you arrive at your hotspot (and you can bring back as much wine as you like too). Brittany Ferries has it covered If you wish to break your journey south, don’t forget that Brittany Ferries can arrange a stay in a carefully selected hotel in a large range of destinations, including the hotels in the renowned Paradores network, whose accommodation is often set in buildings of great historic value. Brittany Ferries’ departures from Plymouth are on Sunday afternoon, meaning you arrive in Santander by Monday lunchtime. Return sailings are on Wednesday. From Portsmouth, there is a weekly choice of departures to Santander or Bilbao and, for added flexibility, you can mix and match your routes. If you are holidaying on the French Riviera and prefer to drive down through France, Brittany Ferries has a wide choice of departures from Portsmouth, Plymouth and Poole to five French ports, with crossings taking as little as three hours. Four-week holidays including quality accommodation and return sailings with a car cost from just £539pp. Search Brittany Ferries for more information on winter sun holidays and services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:48:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
