Sky News 13 Jul 2015 News Eastern Java ... the 3,300-metre (10,800-foot) Mount Raung volcano emits a column of ash and steam. Picture: AFP/ WIDARSHA Source: AFP \nAUSTRALIAN airlines will attempt to bring around 4000 travellers home from Bali on Tuesday after a much-needed reprieve from a persistent volcanic ash cloud. \nBut insurance industry estimates, suggest more than 20,000 Aussies could be caught up in the disruption that began almost a week ago. \nVirgin Australia on Monday scheduled 18 services, including ten extra flights from Bali, and Jetstar also planned to operate 18 flights, many with larger aircraft in order to move more people. \nThe flights are in addition to 19 services flown on Monday by Jetstar, and two by Virgin Australia which combined, assisted more than 2000 people. \nThe return to the skies followed days of flight cancellations as a result of ash clouds from the erupting Mount Raung, 130km west of Denpasar. Trying to get home ... Travellers wait as flights are cancelled. Picture: AP Source: AP \nRather than risk damaging aircraft, and endangering passengers’ lives, Jetstar and Virgin Australia have frequently opted not to fly even in periods when Ngurah Rai Airport was open. \nThe commitment to “safety first” has led to as many as 80 flight cancellations, throwing holiday-makers’ schedules into disarray. \nThousands more remain stranded in Bali but should be able to travel home in coming days, providing the ash plume remains clear of Denpasar. \nBoth Jetstar and Virgin Australia have apologised for the inconvenience and disruption but have appealed to passengers for understanding. \nIn an unprecedented move, Virgin Australia even offered to rebook passengers with tickets to Bali on flights to one of 12 alternative destinations at no extra cost. \nThe offer is designed to avoid more people travelling to Bali and becoming stranded as Mount Raung continues to blow its top. Beauty but pain ... Mount Raung volcano emits continues to send ash into the sky. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nVolcanic Ash Advisory Centre senior meteorologist Stephanie Bond said the volcano had erupted constantly since July 2. \n“We just see this continuous plume coming from Mount Raung,” said Ms Bond. \n“For the next 24-hours we expect the wind pattern to remain pretty much the same, so it should continue to push the plume away from Denpasar. \n“It’s about 50 to 60km away at them moment.” \nNatalie Ball from c omparetravelinsurance.com.au said the industry was expecting between 10,000 and 20,000 claims for additional accommodation and other expenses, or the complete abandonment of holidays. \nThe figures do not include the 30 per cent of Australians believed to travel to Bali without any travel insurance. \nMs Ball said most policies covered travellers for expenses arising from unforeseen events — such as a volcanic eruption. Staying put ... Karen and Robbie Higginson, from Perth, with their children Cayle and Tayla pictured today at Denpasar airport. Picture: Adrian Suwanto Source: Supplied \n“For travellers stuck in Bali beyond the expiration date of their travel insurance policy, the event automatically extends their policy until they’re able to get home,” said Ms Ball. \n“Having said that, it’s not an excuse for holiday-makers to splurge at the insurer’s expense. \n“A two week stay at the swanky W Hotel or an upgraded business class flight is not likely to be paid for. Insurers will cover claims for reasonable and consistent travel expenses.” Bali chaos question and answer \nWhen did Mount Raung start erupting? \nOn July 2, and it has continued to erupt since then. The volcano is 130km west of Denpasar, and ash plumes vary direction according to wind conditions. \nWhy won’t airlines operate aircraft when volcanic ash clouds are about? \nThe Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre website carries the following explanation: \nVolcanic ash in the air is composed of fine pulverised rock and accompanied by a number of gases which are then converted into droplets of sulfuric acid and other substances. It is potentially deadly to aircraft and their passengers. The most critical effect is caused by ash melting in the hot section of the engine, and then fusing into a glasslike coating on components further back in the engine, causing loss of thrust and possible “flame out” (engine failure). In addition there is an abrasion of engine parts, the airframe and parts protruding from the aircraft, and possible clogging of the fuel and cooling systems. Drastic measures ... Virgin Australia offered to rebook passengers with tickets to Bali on flights to one of 12 alternative destinations at no extra cost. Picture: Adrian Suwanto Source: Supplied \nCan’t they fly over or around the plume? \nThe density and height of ash plumes vary. In the case of Mount Raung, the ash plume has at times been across the approach to Denpasar Airport. \nHave Jetstar and Virgin Australia been over cautious? \nNo. In February 2014, Jetstar Asia was left with a $20 million repair bill after an A320 flew through volcanic ash on the way to Jakarta, causing engine damage. In 1982, a British Airways’ 747 suffered a complete engine loss while flying through volcanic ash in Indonesia. The pilot put the aircraft into a steep descent to clear the engines of ash, and was able to get them restarted. \nAre airlines still flying people to Bali, even though they may not be able to fly out as scheduled? \nThousands of Australian travellers leave for Bali every day. It is the most popular overseas destination for Australians after New Zealand, with more than 1.1 million arrivals each year. Virgin Australia is not taking new bookings until Thursday. Jetstar is continuing to book passengers who want to take their chances. Not letting up ... Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre senior meteorologist Stephanie Bond said the volcano had erupted constantly since July 2. Picture: AFP/WIDARSHA Source: AFP \nWill airlines that cancel flights and disrupt travel plans reimburse passengers? \nNo. Most airlines are offering to waive rebooking fees, flight change fees and flight cancellation fees within a limited time period. \nDo insurers cover travellers left out of pocket as a result of flight cancellations? \nMany large insurers cover travellers who experience unforeseen expenses as a result of natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions. The Insurance Council of Australia advises all people stranded in Bali to email or call their insurer for advice. However the ICA estimates between 20 and 25 per cent of Australians visiting Bali have no travel insurance. Airlines, the insurance industry and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are working together to assist those in financial difficulty as a result of the Bali ash cloud disruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T01:26:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
