It's certainly a top draw for visitors to Dubai . With its outstanding range of historic souks and truly remarkable malls, the emirate has carved a name for itself as the shopaholic's dream destination. In fact, it's second only to London for the number of retailers represented, placing Dubai up there with Milan and New York as among the world's top shopping capitals. Dubai's modern malls are the first port of call for most visiting bargain-hunters. Each has its own distinctive character, from elegant Mall of the Emirates to quirky Ibn Battuta Mall, whose layout incorporates six global \"courts\" inspired by a famed Arab traveller. The best-known of all is The Dubai Mall, which is the largest shopping and entertainment centre in the world, offering fashion, beauty, sports and electronic products spread across more than 1,200 stores. Dubai's malls offer much more than just retail therapy. Alongside their endless array of stores, they feature dining, amusements and attractions catering to every phase and walk of life. Among them are leading attractions such as Ski Dubai, an indoor ski resort within Mall of the Emirates, and Sega Republic, a computer-game theme park inside The Dubai Mall. There are separate souks specialising in gold, textiles and spices, and lots of authentic street food Other family-friendly attractions here include the vast Dubai Aquarium, whose 33,000 residents include clown fish, sharks and adorable penguins. With a supporting cast of high-end restaurants, opulent spas and exciting, cultural attractions, the malls are essentially filled with entertainment for all the family. Shoppers seeking a more authentic experience should head to Dubai Creek, the city's historic quarter, to explore a traditional Arabian souk. Here, on either side of the waterway, visitors can engage in some friendly haggling in the markets, shops and stalls hidden away on shaded lanes. There are separate souks specialising in gold, textiles and spices, and of course there's lots of authentic street food to try while you ponder your purchases.
