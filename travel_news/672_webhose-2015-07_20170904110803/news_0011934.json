Photographer's Note \nThe High Level Bridge is one of the main crossings over the Tyne joining Newcastle and Gateshead. The High Level Bridge is a multi purpose bridge. on the lower level there are two pedestrian walkways, as featured in my shot, with a one way road through the centre section. running above this there is a railway track in constant use. As i was framing the shot up i heard people walking behind me so a waited for them to walk passed before opening the shutter to add a bit more character to the shot, as the shutter was open for 3 seconds. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T14:21:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
