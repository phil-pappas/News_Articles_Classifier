Welsh Guards band at Cunard’s 175th anniversary concert, Liverpool \nA season of high-profile events concluded at the weekend with a commemorative concert in Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral, after which Queen Mary 2 departed for Halifax, 175 years to the day that Cunard’s steamship Britannia made its first transaltlantic voyage. \n“The response from customers and our travel partners to our anniversary celebrations has been incredible, and it’s reawakened a lot of people to the specialness of Cunard,” said chief commercial officer for P&O and Cunard, Gerard Tempest. \n‘Everyone’s aware of the brand but perhaps it hasn’t been at the forefront of their minds. Now, we’ve seen a real spike in interest.” \nSuccessful execution of the events had also demonstrated that there is a “Cunard way of doing things,” he added. \nHowever, marketing director Angus Struthers insisted the recent focus on Cunard’s heritage did not mean the line was stuck in the past. \n“We’ve refitted two of our ships in the last 18 months and we’re building on our strengths, with new partnerships with the Telegraph and Blue Note Records. We want to be writing the next 175 of history,” he said. \nFour hundred passengers embarked the QM2 on Saturday, the first time transatlatic passengers have boarded in Liverpool for 50 years. \nDespite calls from local agents and customers for Cunard to base a ship in Liverpool, the facilities at Liverpool Cruise Terminal are not currently appropriate for such a large vessel. However, Struthers admitted the cruise line is “in constant contact” with the city’s Lord Mayor and council, and that there was “absolutely an ambition on both sides to develop the relationship even further”. \n“There is a huge local cruise market here and agents clearly see the potential,” Struthers said. \nTempest added: “It comes down to the ability to provide a Cunard level of service and at the moment that’s quite limited.” \nThe Liverpool concert included readings by Sir Samuel Cunard’s great great grandson, news broadcasters Jennie Bond and Michael Buerk, and politican John Prescott, and musical performances by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Liverpool Cathedral Choir and the Band of the Welsh Guards. \nQueen Mary II later left Liverpool accompanied by fireworks, and will now visit Halifax, Boston and New York, where further commemorative events will be held. \nTravel agents have been invited to a range of different events throughout the celebrations, and Tempest said Cunard had offered more educational visits and better marketing collateral than ever before. \nDanielle Mott, store manager of Thomas Cook’s Liverpool Lord Street branch, said the store had been able to make an £11,000 booking for Cunard just days after creating a special Cunard-themed window display. \n“There’s such a connection between the people of Liverpool and the Cunard brand. Everyone knows someone who used to work for Cunard,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:26:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
