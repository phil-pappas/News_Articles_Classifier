Here are some of my rainy day favorites: Just break out the poncho or umbrella, there’s still lots of Rainy Day Magic to be had at Disney World! It’s easy to play all day long at DisneyQuest , the five-story indoor interactive theme park at Downtown Disney. A visit to The Florida Aquarium is a great way to “sea” life… and hide from the weather! Don’t let the rain drown your imagination — visit a museum ! My picks would be: The National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola and one of the largest air and space museums in the world. You can easily spend most of the day at the Orlando Science Center which is filled with hands-on exhibits and features a domed theatre and planetarium. You might not be able to make it to the links this weekend, but how about playing through exhibits laid out like a golf course at the World Golf Hall of Fame ?\nOf course, what ever you do, stay safe! If heavy rainfall is forecast, authorities always advise staying off the roads. What should you do then? How about firing up that laptop and taking a virtual tour?
