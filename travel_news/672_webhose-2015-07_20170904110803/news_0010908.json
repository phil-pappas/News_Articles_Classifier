Frustration mounting he flicks furiously through a battered notebook stuffed with barely legible codes for the house wifi, his wife’s account and the various other passwords created for him by family members who have tried before to help him get online. \"Try the Google password,\" a calm young voice beside him suggests, after patiently explaining that the ‘g’ in Martin’s gmail address stands for the mighty search engine. A second later Martin is online, delighted. And it is all thanks to the owner of the calm voice and judicious suggestion, a young man into whose orbit Martin would never normally enter. • I pay my teenage grandson to be my IT consultant Twenty-five year-old youtube presenter James Hill has been teamed up with Martin as part of a social experiment which matches generation Y technological whizz kids with elderly technophobes and attempts to introduce them to the wonders of the worldwide web in just six weeks. Martin Crossman and James Hill (Richard Ansett) The results of the cross-generational pairings form a six part series beginning this month on Sky 1. In the tv show half a dozen OAPs – including a woman who thinks a ‘search engine’ is a type of train – will be put through their paces by a group of youngsters to whom posting an online video is as much a part of their daily routine as teeth-brushing. And when you consider that a staggering five million of the nations’s over 65s have never used the internet while at the other end of the spectrum 10 per cent of all British teenagers are logged on for 10 hours every day , the stage is set for high drama. But it also yields some surprising, and heartwarming results. With a floppy fringe, skinny jeans and a vocabulary bursting with glottal stops James Hill is typical of his generation. He graduated from York University with a history degree in 2011, only mixes with computer-literate people his own age and makes a living presenting a series of youtube shows which boast 5million followers. Martin, who despite once working as a computer parts salesman is baffled by the internet and cannot mask his disbelief that James makes money from it. \"And this is your job? Your proper job?\" he asks in amazement. Despite the incongruous start the pair quickly discover they have a shared love of history and genealogy. But the encounter has a serious note too. Martin was diagnosed with scoliosis of the spine at age three and although he led a full life, playing county tennis, cricket and golf: \"At age 65 I just collapsed like a pack of cards. Now I am in a lot of pain so I need to get to grips with the internet because I think I could benefit enormously from pursuing new avenues on it.\" His first challenge is a Golden Wedding Anniversary party for wife Carol and with James’s help he finds he can download a template for invitations, get in touch with friends and order most of the entertainment and catering. But his greatest achievement is the online photo album he makes of the couple’s half century together. (Bloomberg) By the time the 6 weeks is up Martin has embarked on a second digital album, has been browsing on the John Lewis website for a new bed and is so enamoured by his new skill that he regularly needs to be told by long-suffering wife Carol to log-off in the early hours of the morning! • What should I do if my child blocks me on Facebook? Little James, as Martin calls him, should be proud of his tutoring – yet it is arguably he who has learned the most from the unlikely encounter. \"My Mum and Dad divorced when I was very young so I really admire and envy the fact that Martin and Carol have been together for so long. Theirs is a real partnership.\" And he adds, somewhat wistfully: \"That generation seemed to have a clarity of direction that mine don’t. Get a job, work hard, save your money, buy a house, get married, have kids. Sorted.\" He is not the only young person to emerge from the experiment enriched. Roman Kemp a radio presenter and youtuber , comes from a solid family background. The son of Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp and backing singer Shirlie Holliman, he has always known that the elderly can get to grips with technology. \"My Dad’s Dad was one of the first people I knew to get a Skype account and when he and my nan retired to Poole, he used to Skype me every week after the Arsenal game to chat the match!\" Roman’s granddad also taught him about computer coding, but he has felt the loss in his life of an elderly figure for the last six years after he lost all four grandparents within a year. \"I really miss going round my nan’s house for a cup of tea and just having that contact with someone from their generation. You can tell your grandparents things you wouldn’t talk about to your parents about.\" Roman Kemp and Rose Bass (Richard Ansett) Roman is paired with Rose Bass, a 71-year old widow who sees the internet as a chance to keep the channels of communication open with her seven grandchildren. \"Their world is different to mine, they are always on their ipads and computers,\" she says amid the china figurines of her north London home. But Rose, who rolls the word ‘google’ around her tongue like a particularly sour boiled sweet would also like to reconnect with her late husband’s family in Canada. • 10 ways to help older people use the internet Widowed 30 years ago, she lost touch with her husband David’s brother \"because it was just too painful, especially seeing David’s brother Michael because he looks just like David.\" Facebook helps Rose to reconnect with her husbands family (Alamy) Under Roman’s tutelage she gets in touch with Michael and his wife via Facebook and even books tickets online to visit them in Canada – a trip which proves cathartic as the last time she saw them was when she travelled to their home in the immediate aftermath of David’s death to grieve. Roman is touched that she has found some closure for her grief and strengthened the bonds of her family. \"It took me four weeks to get out of Rose that her husband had been incapacitated by a stroke and spent the last 10 years of his life bedridden, being cared for by Rose. • Elderly living alone use internet to keep in touch with family \"She is just like my Nan was in that way – doesn’t show her fears and insecurities – and just gets on with things. My generation can learn a lot from people like Rose about how to deal with what life throws at you and still remain positive.\" And by the time the show ends, Roman, who says he owes his career to his early internet posts about sport - has also been reminded of the importance of family and face-to-face contact. \"The internet is great, but seeing how important relationships are in Rose’s life has made me want to put down my phone more and have a conversation with Mum or Dad.\" George Penfield with the twins Niki and Sammy Albon (Richard Ansett) And perhaps most touching of all – is the pairing of retired French polisher George Penfield, 85, and 22-year-old youtube presenting twins Niki and Sammy Albon . The pair enter George’s life as his wife is in the late stages of cancer and dementia and along with caring for her around the clock, George suddenly has to learn how to run a home. Despite never having switched on a computer before, George is soon adept at online shopping and downloading recipes. And with the understatement characteristic of his generation, adds: \"Having the boys there was a pleasant interlude at a difficult time.\" And in an equally poignant tribute to his contribution to their life, Niki sums up the success of the project, saying: \"George really moved me, especially when he said: \"Don’t waste a single moment of your life. It goes by all too quickly.\" 'OAP Internet Virgins' premieres on Sky 1, July 14, 8pm Follow @TeleGoodLife Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T10:29:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
