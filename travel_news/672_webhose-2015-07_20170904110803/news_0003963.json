The airline will also inaugurate new daily non-stop service between Moncton, New Brunswick, and Ottawa. \n\"In fact, our new flights to and from Halifax represent the single largest increase in service since we began serving the city in 2003. With its fleet of 78-seat turboprop aircraft, WestJet is uniquely positioned to serve new cities and routes, and increase frequencies to existing communities,\" Avery added. \nEffective today, WestJet will also increase frequency between Halifax and St. John's from twice to three times daily, and between Halifax and Ottawa from once to twice daily. \n\"Today, as we welcome WestJet Encore to Halifax Stanfield, we mark another air service milestone for our community,\" said Joyce Carter, Halifax International Airport Authority President and CEO. \"This new service strengthens the connections within Atlantic Canada and beyond, providing travelers with more options than ever before, and demonstrates WestJet's confidence in Halifax and all of Atlantic Canada.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T07:29:06.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
