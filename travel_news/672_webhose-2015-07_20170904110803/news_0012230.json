Pilots also reported seeing ash 3.5 kilometres in the air.\nAuthorities cordoned off a two-kilometre radius around the volcano, and raised the alert level to “Siaga” — the second highest level.\nSafety concerns ... Jetstar has since cancelled most flights in and out of Bali. Picture: Instagram Source: Instagram\nThe Head of Prevention and Disaster Preparedness at the local Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency said that the eruption could be seen from a lookout post in Banyuwangi, East Java.\nVolcanologists have recorded an increase in volcanic activity and tremors on the 3,332-metre high Mount Raung since June 24.\nJetstar customers in Australia can contact the airline via 131 538, while customers in Indonesia can call 001 803 852 9779 and those in Singapore can call (65) 6499 9702.
