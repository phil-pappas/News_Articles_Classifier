A speed restriction was in effect until yesterday to complete repairs on the tracks. \nLast Saturday, VIA Rail attended to the 1,500 affected travellers as quickly and with as much care as possible. Travellers who had a cancelled train were able to change their reservations or obtain a refund. The approximately 700 passengers onboard VIA Rail trains when the incident occurred were provided snacks and refreshments, and were given regular updates while waiting for alternate transportation to their destination. VIA Rail was able to secure transportation, though due to the Pan Am Games and numerous related events held in Greater Toronto , there was a lack of availably of motor coaches which resulted in further unforeseen delays. \nPassengers who were transported by motor coach to their destination have been offered a credit for the full value of their ticket. Additionally, all affected customers, whether they were transported to their destination, or had cancelled or changed their reservations, will receive a discount valued at 50% off for their next trip. The discount is applicable for trips within the Québec city – Windsor corridor, in any class of service and will remain valid for the next 6 months. \nFor more information, please contact our telephone sales office at 1 888 VIA-RAIL (888 842-7245), TTY 800-268-9503 (hearing impaired). \nAbout VIA Rail Canada As Canada's national rail passenger service, VIA Rail Canada ( viarail.ca ) and its 2,500 employees are mandated to provide safe, efficient and economical passenger transportation service, in both official languages of our country.
