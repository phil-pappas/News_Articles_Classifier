The Waco Mammoth Site takes visitors back in time nearly 65,000 years, and reminds us of our country's connection to the history of our planet.\"\nBrowns Canyon, industrial town among new national monuments\nThe significance of the site was almost immediately apparent after Barron and Bufkin found that large bone sticking out of the Earth and took it to Baylor University's Strecker Museum. Experts there identified it as a Columbian mammoth's upper leg bone.\nLearn more about Columbian mammoths and other Ice Age animals at the Waco, Texas, site. Baylor University oversaw site excavation over the next 20 years, discovering the remains of 24 adult and juvenile Columbian mammoths, a saber-toothed cat, a giant tortoise, a Western camel and American alligator.\nThe largest of the mammoths, the Columbian mammoths weighed 7 to 8 tons and were 12 to 14 feet tall, with tusks as long as 16 feet.\nSome 18 of the 24 mammoths discovered are part of the nation's only recorded discovery of a \"nursery herd,\" which the Interior Department describes as \"including females and their offspring, of mammoths from the Ice Age, an era defined as 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.\"\nIt's not known what catastrophic event killed off the herd at the same time. Whatever happened, it preserved the skeletons intact, the Interior Department said. Even the positioning of the animals right before their deaths, with juveniles resting on the tusks of the adults, suggests that the adults were trying to save their young from disaster.\nThe City of Waco has operated the Waco Mammoth Site since 2009, and it donated about 5 acres to the U.S. government to make it possible to set up the national monument.\nThe National Park Service will manage the site in cooperation with the City of Waco and Baylor University.\nObama also designated two other sites as national monuments. California's Berryessa Snow Mountain is \"a landscape containing rare biodiversity and an abundance of recreational opportunities.\"\nThe new Basin and Range site in Nevada \"includes rock art dating back 4,000 years and serves as an irreplaceable resource for archaeologists, historians, and ecologists.\"", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.waco-texas.com/cms-waco-mammoth/page.aspx?id=174", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/10/fact-sheet-president-obama-designates-new-national-monuments", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-small-11.jpg", "http://www.doi.gov/news/pressreleases/secretary-jewell-applauds-president-obamas-action-to-establish-waco-mammoth-national-monument-in-texas.cfm", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710131002-02-waco-mammoth-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:53:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
