Each individual report includes 16 charts with key metrics across airfares, cabin class, length of stay, and carrier capacity and performance (by airline). \nCity Pair Report began as a concept by ARC’s Corporate Travel Advisory Board, where members voiced the need for a cost-effective and rapidly delivered O&D report that presented airline-specific data at a market level. The reports draw from ARC’s world-class airline ticket data repository, which includes 900,000 different O&D airport pairs dating back five years. City Pair Report will consolidate data for the 15-month time period ending 90 days before the report request. \nBy providing market benchmarking data, City Pair Report will equip business travel buyers with the insights they need to enhance their travel program strategy, prepare for supplier conversations, incorporate into executive briefs, fine-tune travel policies and uncover potential cost savings opportunities. \n“This new product was conceived by corporate travel buyers for corporate travel buyers,” said Doug Mangold, ARC’s managing director of product. “At ARC we understand the challenges and complexities of managing a corporate travel program, but the data that we have can provide unmatched insight into market level performance. Last year we introduced FareSight® to help buyers fine-tune their programs by benchmarking their performance against the market. This year, with City Pair Report, ARC provides another data view that is available quickly, current and easy to purchase. We look forward to continue serving corporate travel buyers to help them in their job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T01:09:21.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
