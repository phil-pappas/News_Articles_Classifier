Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) July 19 at 10:10 PM “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice,” the latest installment in the superhero-movie franchise, won’t hit theaters until next summer. But a trailer released last week gave bat-fans a tiny taste of what’s to come, including this not-spoiling-too-much spoiler that the brief video offers: It looks as if Sen. Patrick J. Leahy’s cameo made the cut.\nIf you squint, there he is, in what looks to be La La Land’s idea of a congressional briefing room. So he plays a senator? Not much of a stretch.\nThe Vermont Democrat is a huge fan of comic books, and the latest movie would be his fifth such film role. But as with just about anything in the movie business, you can never be certain that a person’s on-screen moment won’t wind up on the proverbial cutting-room floor.\nOne institution will be particularly pleased that he’s getting some big-screen time — Leahy donates all the fees and royalties from his caped-crusader roles to the children’s wing of the Kellogg Hubbard Library in Montpelier, Vt. Program and development coordinator Rachel Senechal tells us that the checks are something of an oddity around the library, albeit a very welcome one. Apparently, they come in small, irregular amounts, many of which wouldn’t buy you a large popcorn at your average multiplex. “$4.31, $10.66, $11, $2.01,” she said, ticking off the most recent receipts.\nBut the minuscule amounts add up. Senechal says Leahy’s movie earnings over the years total $22,644.74.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T05:16:36.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
