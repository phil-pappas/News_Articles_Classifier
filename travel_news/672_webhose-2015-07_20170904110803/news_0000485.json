Can it also hold your iPad, sunglasses, phone, portable charger and even a can of drink at the same time? If not, you may want to get your hands on the BauBax, which promises to do all these — and more. \nThe self-styled “world’s best travel jacket” is a 15-in-1 creation by Yoganshi Shah, founder of a Chicago-based start-up specialising in “creative lifestyle products”. What’s more impressive is that this jacket comes in four different forms for both men and women: A sweater, a windbreaker, a bomber and a blazer. Since it was launched on Kickstarter last week, it has raised US$372,585 (RM1.038 million) or S$508,000 (at press time), far exceeding its US$20,000 goal. The company plans to start shipping its first jackets by November. \nIf this shows anything, it’s that there’s a demand among travellers to make life on the road more convenient and comfortable. Just consider all the wacky travel inventions that have been produced thus far: The USB Air Conditioned Shirt, with in-built fans that kick into action the moment you plug your shirt into a laptop or pop in four AA batteries; the B-Tourist, a contraption made of elastic cloth that transforms your economy seat into your own private cocoon; and Toothettes, which is somewhat like cotton buds for teeth that help freshen your breath. And let’s not even start on those quirky Japanese inventions that take creativity to a whole new level. \nBut there are lots more that travellers can do with. In fact, here’s a wish list of items we hope will be invented soon. \n1. Odour-cancelling face mask \nWe have noise-cancelling ear phones to block out sonic disturbances, but what if you’re sitting beside someone who stinks? I once sat beside a young guy on board a Eurostar train who probably hadn’t showered since he was 10 and had to keep my back turned to him throughout the three-hour ride. No one should have their noses assaulted like this. While there are essential oils and perfumes to turn to, these aren’t quite as effective. We suggest a handy, lightweight odour-cancelling mask that neutralises offensive scents. They can look like ordinary face masks, so your neighbour wouldn’t Spect a thing. \n2. Compression boots (with built-in foot massager) \nAnything to make long-haul flights on cattle class bearable is always godsend. While we have compression stockings that can help prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), how about a pair of stylish and slim-fitting boots that not only do the job of compression stockings, but are also equipped with battery-operated special soles to massage your feet? It’s like having your very own foot-reflexology session on board. \n3. Defence blankie \nDon’t you hate it when your neighbour invades your arm space or his legs encroach into your already meagre legroom? The Defence Blankie can keep your neighbour at arm’s length. Wrap yourself in this super soft blanket that’s specially fitted with tiny electro nodes that zap your neighbour if he or she comes into contact with it. Voila, you can now sleep peacefully. \n3. The scam detector \nThere’s practically an app for everything from maps to language translation and currency conversion. But how about one that tells you if something you’re buying is genuine simply by snapping a photo? Or maybe also inform you if you’re paying too much for something. An app like that would definitely save us lots of time hesitating and haggling. \n4. Make-up and hair helmet \nEver had to go directly from the airport to a work meeting and wished you had time to freshen up? The make-up and hair helmet would come in handy. Place it over your immaculately painted face and release a special air capsule to keep your make-up looking fresh and dewy. Even men may find it useful in maintaining the texture and style of their perfectly coiffed hairdo. To make it more convenient and portable, the helmet would be completely collapsible and equipped with a pocket-sized pack of air capsules. With this, you don’t ever have to look like human dreg when you step off a plane. \n5.Thirst-quenching pills \nWe don’t know how scientifically possible this is, but it sure sounds like something we’d like to have in the future. One annoying thing about long- haul flights is getting up to use the toilet. And it’s a pain if you’re faced with a wet and dirty cubicle. We’d never face that situation again if we could pop pills to quench our thirst and hydrate ourselves — without having to leave our seats to go to the loo. Think about how helpful that would be. These would also be invaluable during long road trips where there’s no toilet in sight or when you’re in a foreign city and have no idea where the nearest washroom is. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T06:41:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
