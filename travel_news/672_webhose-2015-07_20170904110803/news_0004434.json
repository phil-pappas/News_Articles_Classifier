Stuhr building's renovation took 18 months and cost more than $7 million. \nA wooden wagon is the only artifact on the building's top floor that visitors will find familiar when the remodeled building reopens. New exhibits on the second floor are a wooden windmill and a gun collection. \nMuseum Executive Director Joe Black says staff decided to focus on different stories and artifacts because it would have been a disservice for the museum \"to tell the same stories over and over.\" \nInformation from: The Grand Island Independent, http://www.theindependent.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:07:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
