None of the three was said to be in a serious condition. Related content Ten of the world’s most unusual runs \nThree other Americans were among the eight others injured, most with bruises sustained in falls and crowd crushes during the nationally televised run that lasted just over two minutes. \nThe daily run sees people dashing with six bulls along a narrow, 930-yard (850-metre) course from a holding pen to the city’s bullring. The bulls are then killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon. \nThe nine-day fiesta in Pamplona, which features 24-hour street partying, was made famous in Ernest Hemingway’s 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises and attracts thousands of foreign tourists. \nBull runs are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens are injured each year in the runs, most in falls. \nTwo men have died recently after being gored by bulls in Spanish festivals - one on Saturday in the eastern town of Grao de Castellon and another on June 24 in the south-western town of Coria. \nIn all, 15 people have died from gorings in Pamplona since record-keeping began in 1924 for the San Fermin festival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T17:43:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
