More YouTube advertisers increase 40% in year \nIt said it had “removed the posts related to this incident” and that it had “been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorised access points”. The company added that it was “working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act”. \nIt comes three months after Ashley Madison announced plans for an initial public offering in London later this year. Avid Life did not reveal whether the attack would affect its plans to list. \nKrebsOnSecurity , the security blog that broke the news, reported that a group called The Impact Team had claimed responsibility. It said the group had posted a notice on AshleyMadison.com that it had “taken over all systems in your entire office, and production domains, all customer information databases, source code repositories, financial records, emails”. \nIts complaint appears to be that when subscribers pay $19 for a “full delete” of their data, users’ purchase details including real name and address are allegedly retained. Avid Life rejected the accusation. \nIn a screen grab posted on KrebsOnSecurity, the alleged hackers’ statement threatened to release all customers’ records, including “secret sexual fantasies, nude pictures, and conversations and matching credit card transactions, real names and addresses” if Ashley Madison and partner site Established Men were not shut down “immediately and permanently”. \nAshleyMadison.com says it had 37m members in 48 countries, making it the second-largest dating website by number of users after Match.com. \nLombard: Brief encounter \nDivorce lawyers will be lining the streets, writes Kate Burgess , after Avid Life Media, which operates Ashley Madison, said it had been hacked. \nContinue reading \nThe website — which carries the slogan “Life is short. Have an affair” — makes money by charging men for “credits”, which they can cash in to gain introductions to women. \nThe group said it had sales of $115m in 2014, representing a 45 per cent increase compared with the previous year, with 50 per cent of its business is in the US. It values itself at $1bn. \nIn addition to Ashley Madison and Established Men, Avid Life also runs Cougarlife.com. \nThe company has said funds raised in any flotation would be used to launch the site in more countries, with the aim of having more than half of its sales in Asia by the end of this decade.
