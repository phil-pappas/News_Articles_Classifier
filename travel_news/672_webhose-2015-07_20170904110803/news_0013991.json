My jaw dropped open at the very first look! The White House was one of my main reasons for visiting Washington DC and here I stood in front of it completely dejected. I felt like I was let down. I felt like I had been fooled. It was one of those moments that shook very part of my cranial region. Even my American friend felt the same way. Both of us had explored all of the monuments in the National Mall area before reaching the White House. The idea was to save the best for the last. But when we stood in front of the White House, we wore a completely shocked look. The image of the White House in my head is based on the many Hollywood movies that I had seen like, Die Hard, Independence Day, 2012, White House Down, Olympus has fallen, Superman II, Mars Attacks and others. Now, the irony is that from all these movies I had somehow created an image of the White House with a white dome in my head. Apparently, that building is the Capitol Building (the seat of all power) and not the White House. But, in my brain, that was the image of the White House. So when I was actually standing in front of the white house and ended up doing some Google search to find my folly, the irony hit me. And it hit me like a brick. It hit me so hard that I shared this irony with a lot of my friends and they seemed to empathize with me. Are you one of them? Does your image of the White House have a big white dome? Did you ever get fooled at the White House like me? What is your story? Tell meâ€¦I would like to hear it. Trip Courtesy: Discover America , the tourism board of the United States of America.
