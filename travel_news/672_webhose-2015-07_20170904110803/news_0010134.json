You must be willing to dedicate time and attention to detail or you risk making the wrong decision and harming the productivity of your operation. Below are five key factors that you need to consider early on in your search for an online booking engine. Be clear on the features you need Note down exactly what features your software needs to support your everyday business processes and online booking management, this will help the supplier to better meet your requirements and the development will run much smoother. It will also help you and your team to keep a clear idea of what the finished product should look like, and when it comes to discussing details you'll be in a much better position. Perhaps you need profile management tools, dynamic packaging or consolidator tools. If you don't know what the problem is, how will you find the right solution? Consider whether you need a bespoke package It may be that you find an 'off-the-shelf' software that works for your business and need only pay a set price with agreed monthly payments dependant on any follow-up support and maintenance you opt for. However, with the modern travelling consumer demanding more from leisure companies and due to differing company cultures in the corporate arena, many businesses are seeking bespoke services that can be customized. If you find this is the case for you, it is imperative that you cooperate with the developers and that you are willing to put the time and effort in to iron out every crease. Try before you buy - request a demo This is the perfect way for you to gain an understanding of how you will use the booking tools on offer and to raise any concerns about specific features or processes that you don't fully understand. It is particularly valuable for a standard product, but if you're thinking of entering in to a bespoke project enquire about trialling certain features. The developers and consultants can only tell you so much, it would be much more beneficial to see it for yourself. Do the training and arrange the necessary support Furthermore, when your software is appropriately customised and ready to be implemented, arrange the proper training and ensure that you will have access to the support that you need! Your team may be confident in their IT abilities but every software package is different and you will save your company a lot of time and headaches if you have direction from the software company's personnel. You will also spare your supplier's staff a lot of headaches and unnecessary support phone calls if you take the training. It is important that you do have access to good on-going support from your supplier for when things go wrong - you owe it to your business and your customers! What experience does the solution provider have? Choose an established travel and technology company with experience of delivering high quality solutions. How long has the company been operating? Do they have high profile clients or clients that you can contact for a reference? Consider those that have a strong in-house team of experts, too much outsourcing may lead to delays and you do not want to have to navigate multiple channels just to get an update.
