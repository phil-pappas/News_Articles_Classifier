The damaged jet (tail No. N664US) was among the first of Northwest's 747-400s and flew routes to and from China under \"The Spirit of Beijing\" moniker. Twenty-six years after its first flight, the plane's value depreciated to somewhere between $6 million and $10 million, estimated George Dimitroff , head of valuations at Flightglobal in New York. That was before Delta Flight 159 flew into the storm. Now, the hail-marred airframe would be worth maybe $50,000 as scrap metal if Delta doesn't repair the plane, Dimitroff estimated. The 747's four Pratt & Whitney PW4000-SER engines could each sell for $1 million to $2.5 million if they're undamaged and serviceable, he said. \"This aircraft was close to retirement anyway, and most of its value was in its engines even before the incident, so if the engines are undamaged, the impact to total value wouldn’t be too big,\" Dimitroff said. Delta has been retiring airworthy 747s as part of a plan to take them all out of service by 2017 and use smaller, more fuel-efficient planes. There are still about a dozen Delta 747s in the air, which means the airline will soon have more than enough retired 747s in storage. Used Boeing 747-400s are listed from $12 million to $26 million online , but those are for newer models in better condition. Damage to the plane's radome (on the nose) was obvious from a photo snapped by a passenger, but the more expensive repairs could be to the wings, tail and those valuable turbofan engines. If Delta were to put any more money into the jet, it is likely getting just enough repairs to safely fly from Seoul to the U.S. It might be cheaper to scrap the plane in South Korea. Delta told the National Transportation Safety Board that the plane incurred no significant damage in the hailstorm, but hasn't provided any information about the damaged aircraft. Rather than bring the plane back into service, Delta decided it was faster, cheaper — or both — to pull another former Northwest Airlines 747-400 out of an aircraft boneyard and fly it to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to resume operation. That plane, tail No. N671US, flew from storage in the Arizona desert to Minneapolis Sunday night and took its first passengers to Detroit and back Wednesday . It flew to New York Thursday morning and continued to Amsterdam, but declared an emergency and landed in Ireland on the return trip to Atlanta Friday . \nWant Seattle Travel news in your inbox?
