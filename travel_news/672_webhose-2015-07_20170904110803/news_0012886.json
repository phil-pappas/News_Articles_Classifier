While some people regard the only true holiday as one away from contact with the outside world, in an age of email, social media and 24/7 news many people want to be connected when they feel like it.\nWhile most cruise lines offer packages it comes at a hefty cost, and connection time is so slow a package of, say, 100 minutes slips by very quickly. Some lines offer it for free — while lazing your way around the Fiji islands on Captain Cook Cruises’ Reef Endeavour you can post your photos on social media for free and check your emails.\nLuxury line Silversea has announced it will provide free Wi-Fi on all its ships from next January. Guests will be provided a minimum of one hour free Wi-Fi, rising to unlimited access depending on suite category. The free service fits with Silversea’s all-inclusive policy on its all-suite ships, which covers drinks and gratuities.\nIt is a challenge for other cruise lines in an era when people expect to be able to hook up to the world through their smartphones and tablets, even while lounging by the pool — and social media shots of people having a good time is surely good advertising for cruise lines.\nEYES ON ASIA\nROYAL Caribbean Cruises is answering the demand for cruises through Asia with more ships and itineraries across its three brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises offering 24 voyages to 34 ports this season.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Australasia commercial director Sean Treacy said the popularity of the brands’ cruises in Asia had quadruped in five years.\n“This incredible demand has been met by an increase in capacity and the number of ships that now service the region — starting from one in 2007 and now with six beautifully modern ships regularly based in Asia,” he said.\n“We’re also seeing a strong trend for family group cruises and multi-generational cruises. We often find that many families with ties to the region choose a cruise to reconnect with loved ones.” Popular cruise destinations include Bangkok and Phuket in Thailand, Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Bali in Indonesia.\n Izumi Japanese Restaurant in Voyager of the Seas cruise ship.
