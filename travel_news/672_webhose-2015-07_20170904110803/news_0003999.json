(AFP/Getty Images) \nOccupancy levels at hotels in Dubai slumped by more than 15 percent during Ramadan while daily rates and revenues also fell sharply, according to STR Globalâ€™s preliminary June data for the emirate. \nBased on daily data from June, Dubai reported an increase in supply (up 4.6 percent) and a decrease in demand (down by 11.6 percent). \nThe figures also revealed a 15.4 percent decrease in occupancy to 63 percent and a 8.6 percent decrease in average daily rate to AED592.69. \nDubai hotels also experienced a 22.7 percent decrease in revenue per available room to AED373.53 during the holy month which traditionally is a quiet period for the hospitality sector. \nSTR Global said from June 18-30, Dubai reported slightly higher occupancy (41.6 percent) compared to the first 13 days of Ramadan in 2014 (40.9 percent). \nHowever, ADR during that same set period fell 5.6 percent to AED529.34, and RevPAR dipped 3.7 percent to AED220.43. \nSTR Global added that supply growth placed additional pressure on occupancy levels, which has also affected hotel performance in Dubai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T00:42:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
