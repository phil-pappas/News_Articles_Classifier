(AP) - One of three men charged with killing a grandmother in the Vermont town of Sheffield is due in court where he's expected to change his plea.\nMichael Norrie is scheduled for a change of plea hearing Tuesday afternoon. He pleaded not guilty last year to first-degree murder, kidnapping and burglary in the death of Mary \"Pat\" O'Hagan during an attempted burglary.\nAttorney Rob Sussman, representing Norrie, says he does not expect the 24-year-old to be sentenced at Tuesday's hearing. That will follow a pre-sentence investigation by the Department of Corrections.\nSussman says his client is not offering to testify against a co-defendant, 34-year-old Keith Baird, as part of the plea bargain.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
