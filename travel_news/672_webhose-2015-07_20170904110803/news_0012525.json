The debris -- which investigators seem increasingly confident came from a Boeing 777 like MH370 -- was discovered this week on the remote Indian Ocean island of Reunion. Work to conclusively identify the debris will begin midweek, French prosecutors say, but not before a French investigative judge meets with French and Malaysian air transport investigators and Malaysian judicial authorities. A preliminary report could come as early as next week, a source close to the French investigation told CNN on Friday. The report won't give \"an exact sequence of events,\" the source said, but will at least eliminate some scenarios.
