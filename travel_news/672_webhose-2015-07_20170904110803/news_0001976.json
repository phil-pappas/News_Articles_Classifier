The Bali Hotel Association speaks out and released this statement today: \nThe Bali Hotels Association shows empathy in a proactive move towards travelers affected by the disruption caused by the Mount. Raung Volcano ashes. \nBali Hotels Association, representing more than one hundred and thirty hotels in Bali, stands together with the travelers affected by the disruption caused by the Mt. Raung Volcano ashes and, unlike other some destinations, does not wish to take advantage of the unfortunate situation. \nIt suggests great empathy towards all travelers and provides the following guidelines: \nFor passengers that need to extend their stay, the Best Available Rate (also known as BAR) should be proposed when requests are made directly to the hotel. For bookings that are made through a third party, contracted rates apply. \nFor passengers that cannot come to Bali or will arrive later than original dates booked, BHA members are recommended to accept, at no charge, to re-book their stay (based on availability and rates during new requested period) until end of 2015. \nBali Hotels Association looks forward to a better situation that will allow all travelers to enjoy their trip to and from the island in a non-disruptive environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:00:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
