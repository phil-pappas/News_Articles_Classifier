For these kids, school is often the only constant in their lives.\nThat’s why the coalition’s volunteer-run Project Cool is working hard this year to ensure more than 1,400 students receive a sturdy backpack filled with high-quality supplies.\nHelp buy supplies To give online, visit: seati.ms/edschoolsupplies\nQuestions? Email ffn@seattletimes.com\nIf you prefer to write a check, please send those to:\nThe Seattle Times School Supply Drive, P.O. Box C-11025, Seattle, WA 98111\nProject Cool also helps to train school staff and social workers on ways to support the educational rights of homeless kids under federal law.\n Readers can help by donating to The Times’ annual school-supply drive . All proceeds go directly toward purchasing supplies and are evenly split among three local agencies: the coalition, Hopelink and YWCA Seattle King Snohomish.\nA $60 contribution provides one child with a new backpack stuffed with crayons, books and basic health tools. A $100 gift purchases enough spiral notebooks for 25 high-school freshman students to write essays; $200 buys crayons, colored pencils and markers for 30 kindergarten kids.\nGenerosity can be shown in other ways, too.\n• The coalition accepts in-kind donations , particularly during supply sales in the summer and fall.\n• Volunteers can sign up to organize and stuff backpacks between July 13 and 19.\n• Ask your dentist to donate toothbrushes, toothpaste and floss for dental kits. Homeless children have 10 times the rate of poor teeth development as the general population and are less likely to visit a dentist’s office.\nFor more information on Project Cool opportunities, call 206-204-8350 or email projectcool@homelessinfo.org\nThe last thing kids struggling with challenges at home want is to feel different from peers. By sending them to class with the tools they need to learn, students are more likely to feel motivated and stay in school.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
