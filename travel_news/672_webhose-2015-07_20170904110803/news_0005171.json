Planned in the 19th century to carry freight from Texas to the Pacific, the 407-mile route was a construction challenge, taking 60 years to complete and opening in 1961. The train runs from Chihuahua in the east to the Pacific, through 87 tunnels, over 36 bridges and, in places, climbing to a height of 8,210ft using spiral systems. The journey takes 12 hours (refreshments are available) and most passengers break the trip at the summit in hotels dramatically perched on the canyon rim. Situated in the Sierra Madre Mountains, this spectacular natural attraction is a complex of deep gorges, collectively known as the Copper Canyon and comparable with the Grand Canyon. The central canyons are reached by a four-mile cable car or a zipwire circuit. It’s a remarkable railway experience. Geoffrey Queen, from Yorkshire, wins a voucher with DialAFlight More advice from readers Malaysia Travelling between Kuala Lumpur and Penang several years ago was my favourite rail journey on all levels. The scenery was amazing while rattling through the jungle; the food was interesting, with all manner of world cuisines produced by one man with a wok and a rice cooker; and a mixture of styles of coach made up the train. The first-class air-conditioned accommodation was too cold; refuge was, however, found in the restaurant car – open doors and the one man and a wok working to satisfy the needs of the Europeans, Indians, Malays and Chinese asking for their favourite foods. After lunch we took a walk through the train to the back, where the end carriage was open at the rear – not an observation car, more a missing panel. Robin Humber, Bedfordshire Penang, Malaysia Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Peru The most amazing rail journey is in Peru – the 12-hour trip from Cuzco to Puno. Climbing from Cuzco, the enormous diesel engine struggled backwards and forwards, belching plumes of black smoke, all the way up the switchback and on through the breathtaking scenery of the Andes. The only stop en route was to refuel. Then, I thought I would nip from the observation car in which we were travelling at the rear of the train to the front to photograph the engine. It almost killed me. On the way back – slowly, very slowly – I noticed the altitude sign “14,250ft”. No wonder it was a struggle. We continued across the wilds of the Altiplano to Juliaca, where the train went through the market, and on to our final destination Puno (for Lake Titicaca, where people live in reed houses on reed beds). Brian Curd, Dorset Cuzco, Peru Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Vietnam Slowly, swaying badly and clanking loudly, the Reunification Express left Hanoi on its overnight trip to Hue. Exhausted by sightseeing, my wife slept in our ambitiously named “soft sleeper”. I stood in the corridor, sipping duty-free whisky and marvelling at all the shiny American trucks and Lexus cars on the road outside. “It is always three hours late getting to Hue.” Alongside me was a smartly dressed Vietnamese man. “I do this journey every week for the Agriculture Ministry,” he said. “My meetings are still scheduled as though the train runs to time. May I join you?” For two hours we put the world to rights and the bottle to bed. As we parted, he said, “I’ve seen what the British built in India. Only the French would put full-size trains on a narrow-gauge track – 25mph top speed. Express? I wish you’d colonised us.” William Dean, Lancashire Hue, Vietnam Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Egypt On a shoestring trip to Egypt, we planned a circuitous route from Luxor to Hurghada to Cairo and back. The final leg from Cairo to Luxor on the train was timed to fit perfectly with our flight departure. We went to the station and queued for what felt like hours, but treated ourselves to first-class tickets as the difference between first and second wasn’t huge. Boarding the train on our final Egyptian adventure, we found lovely reclining leather seats, refreshing air conditioning and personal video screens all playing local films at top volume in Arabic. The train line runs parallel to the Nile and we had been warned that bandits could board the train, but a little danger adds to the adventure. Our journey was meant to take six hours, but at one point the train stopped, which meant we were able to see the sun rise over the Nile and the mist hanging on the fields… unforgettable.

We were congratulating ourselves at managing to get an empty compartment on a long trip from Madurai to Madras when a family of six small children dragged their parents into our presence. Their father placed the four older ones in the overhead luggage rack, from where they stared down at us. Occasionally they would whisper something and the whole family would burst into raucous laughter. What silenced them for a good few minutes, though, was when my wife blew her nose into a handkerchief and put the hankie in her pocket. They all stared at her for some time before the eldest child asked his father why the lady wanted to keep the contents of her nose. He could hardly stop laughing while he translated. Bernard Jones, Devon United States My favourite rail journey was travelling from New York to San Francisco, coast to coast. However, the most exciting bit was from Silverton to Durango on a steam train. There is no station in the old mining town of Silverton, itself a complete blast from the past, so the train just pulls up in the middle of town. This was a three-hour journey through the most spectacular scenery from beginning to end. We were like a bunch of excited children as we darted from one side of the carriage to the other, clicking away with our cameras and not wanting to miss a second. On one side were mountains and valleys, and on the other was a rapidly flowing river that was so close at times you could almost touch the water.

As the city melts away, the landscape changes from brown to green and blue. Water. It’s everywhere. The train chugs over huge bridges crossing the wide span of the Surma river. Looking down, you see fishermen casting their nets and children playing on the banks. The train rhythm induces sleep, but you are woken by noisy street sellers knocking on the side of the carriage, selling coconut water, as the train stops at a station. Soon, as the train moves and the aromatic hillside tea gardens begin to emerge, you know you are nearly there.
