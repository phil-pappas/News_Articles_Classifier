The most popular category is Public Space, with 8 nominations, three of which are from London, Ontario; Meadowlily Woods Environmentally Significant Area , Blackfriars Bridge and Labatt Memorial Park which currently leads in total votes. London has an amazing community following and the voting numbers have already entered the thousands! However, we're not even half-way through the contest so it's anybody's race yet. The Abbey Centre (pictured) in Blackfalds, Alberta is proving itself to be a strong contender in the vote-count, sitting in second place. Bon Accord Memorial Rose Garden , also in Alberta, has a good community behind their nominee. Grizzly Plaza in Revelstoke and Pemberton Downtown Community Barn represent British Columbia with their great public venues, and our first East Coast nominee, AA Macdonald Memorial Gardens , is located in Georgetown, PEI. In the Neighbourhood category, there are two contenders to date. The first is Cobble Beach Golf Resort Community in Kemble, Ontario. Quartier Petit Champlain (Petit Champlain neighbourhood) in Québec City, has entered the race again to vie for the title of Great Neighbourhood which it was awarded in 2013. Remember, with the exception of 2014 winners, places which have won in the past are eligible to be nominated again. Past nominees and finalists from any year are encouraged to put themselves back in contention for the title of Great Place. With free national exposure and an opportunity to re-create the community excitement it garnered the first time they nominated – there's nothing to lose! The Canadian Institute of Planners (CIP), created the Great Places in Canada contest to engage Canadians in sharing their favourite places and to recognize the work accomplished by professional planners to make these places possible. There are two ways to win: \n1. Grand Prize Winner in each category is determined by a jury of professional planners, based on a variety of planning merits. 2. People's Choice goes to the place in each category with the most online votes. Nominations can be submitted until September 3rd, 2015 , but the earlier nominations are posted, the sooner they can start collecting votes. Voting closes September 24th, 2015 . After the finalists are announced in October, the Grand Prize winners and People's Choice winners will be declared November 4th, 2015 , in conjunction with World Town Planning Day. Prizes are being provided by the contest's generous sponsors, VIA Rail Canada and Roots Canada.
