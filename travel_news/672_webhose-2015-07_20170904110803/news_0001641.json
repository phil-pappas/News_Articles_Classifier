The design idea could fit up to 80 more passengers in a plane, depending on the current seat layout. (Zodiac Aerospace) By next year, congestion at Los Angeles International Airport one day out of each week could be as bad as it is on the day before Thanksgiving, according to a new study. ( Hugo Martin ) \nOne of the world's largest airline seat makers, Zodiac Seats France, has applied for a patent to reconfigure the seats on airplanes so that every other passenger in a row is facing toward the back of the plane. That means that in a row of three fliers, the seat by the window and the seat by the aisle face toward the front of the plane while the middle seat faces toward the back. \nTo make it easier to exit, the seats flip up when a passenger stands, like the seats in many movie theaters. \nThis seat design — called Economy Class Cabin Hexagon — can increase the number of passengers who can fit on a typical Boeing 767 by up to 80 fliers, depending on the existing layout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:23:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
