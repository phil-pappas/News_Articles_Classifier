It just happened to be on the way as I travelled overland from Argentina’s central wetlands to the Uruguayan coast. Still, having been raised on boil-in-the-tin pies and baby’s heads – the Lancashire name for steak and kidney puddings – I made a pitstop to see the old meatpacking factory. • New Unesco World Heritage sites for 2015 My first impression was one of desiccated dilapidation. I’ve always liked industrial ruins, and the assemblage of broken gates, windowless frames, empty workers’ canteens and collapsing cattle corrals didn’t disappoint. The eeriness was helped by the location – it stands all alone on the east bank of the River Uruguay – and a backdrop of flat, fertile pampas and pretty palm trees. The factory was opened in 1859 by the German firm Liebig's Extract of Meat Company, which invented the Oxo cube and fed the country's troops during the First World War. In 1924, the plant passed into British hands and started to export frozen beef; those who live in Fray Bentos – the nearest town – still call it the Frigorífico Anglo. A local guide led me up a rickety wooden ramp and gleefully informed me: \"You English were so ingenious in your use of gravity. The cow would walk up here, to the very top of the factory, and then would be killed [in view of other cows] and turned into leather hides, meat and corned beef, which was processed on lower floors. “There was no need to mechanise anything – the cow did all the work by climbing to the top of the production line.” If ever Morrissey needed a physical site to flag up his meat-hating message, Fray Bentos is probably it. But does the site merit the Unesco World Heritage status that it was awarded over the weekend? The awarding committee labelled the ruin a “Cultural-Industrial Landscape”, claiming it “illustrates the whole process of meat sourcing, processing, packing and dispatching”. In fact, it doesn’t illustrate anything. The singular – and simple - appeal of Fray Bentos lies in its emptiness, its gloominess, the feeling that you’re in a Graham Greene novel. Unesco status probably means infographics, entrance tickets, health and safety, and tourist groups on buses. It will become another dull half-museum of the kind British holidaymakers know so well. My main memory of Fray Bentos pies was scraping out the bottom of the tin to get at least one morsel of meat to accompany the towering dome of flaky pastry. It now seems Unesco, at risk of eroding the cultural-cum-commercial brand it devised to protect genuine marvels such as the Taj Mahal, is scraping the bottom of the barrel merely to expand its list of World Heritage Sites - and justify its costly committees. Three more worthy heritage sites in southern South America Palermo Viejo, Buenos Aires One of the city’s few remaining characterful, low-slung neighbourhoods, permanently under threat from encroaching development. Most of the cobbled streets and old bars and steakhouses are already gone, but external pressure could help conserve what’s left. Atlantic coast, Uruguay Development has already gobbled up much of this small country’s coast, but Unesco should ensure that the marine life and coastal flora and fauna are placed under a conservation order; the alternative is exclusive resorts all the way from Punta del Este to the Brazilian border. La Trochita, Argentina Patagonia’s famous narrow-gauge railway line - the southernmost leg of the continental network - from Ingeniero Jacobacci to Esquel currently operates a sporadic and partial service. It needs a higher profile to encourage maintenance and needs visitor numbers to draw tourism investors. • The world's scariest train rides Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:27:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
