And a new WalletHub report confirms that even further. The Mile High City is the tenth best city for recreation out of the 100 largest U.S. cities, based on 27 metrics the Washington D.C.-based financial analysis site used to identify which cities are best and worst for recreation. Business Pulse Some of those metrics included number of entertainment and recreations facilities (like music venues, coffee shops, bike rental facilities and more), costs of entertainment and quality of parks (such as the percentage of the population with walkable access). Denver is: 31 st – Spending on parks per capita. 53 rd – Parkland as a % of city area. 19 th – Number of bike rental facilities per 100,000 residents. 13 th – Percent of population with walkable park access. 15 th – Number of music venues per 100,000 residents. 32 nd – Number of tennis courts per 100,000 residents. 11 th – Number of park playgrounds per 100,000 residents. 9 th – Number of swimming pools per 100,000 residents. \"The characteristics of a park should match its goals in relation to overall system planning,\" said Michael B. Edwards , assistant professor of parks, recreation & tourism management at North Carolina State University. \"Parks designed for interaction with nature, mental restoration or for physical activity may need different size, amenities and locations.\" He added that stakeholders should consider features, condition, access, aesthetics, safety and programming and policies related to parks and how they facilitate the outcomes they seek from the park or area.

John Hickenlooper last month also created the Colorado Outdoor Recreation Industry Office, aimed at managing and expanding Colorado's $4.2 billion recreation industry .
