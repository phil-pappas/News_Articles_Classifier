An example of a Passport Maps rendering for a trip to France. (Passport Maps) Make your trip even more unforgettable with a custom map. \nPassport Maps put memories in place, art from your trip, customized full-color map Name: Eagle Creek Emerson Carry-All ( Terry Gardner, Special to Tribune Newspapers ) \nWhat they are: Created by Scott Lussier, Passport Maps keep the memories of a person's favorite trip fresh. Lussier, a college instructor, graphic designer, professional mapmaker and inveterate traveler from Bridgewater, Mass., takes vacation notes and photos and designs a customized full-color map, ready for your wall (suitable for a 12-by-18-inch or 11-by-17 frame). They are printed on hefty, bright white acid-free stock. Each map highlights a person's itinerary of places visited and includes a legend describing why the traveler enjoyed those places. \nThe good: More than photos in a computer or a key chain in a desk drawer, the maps keep the memory of a treasured trip alive, right there on an office or living room wall. Plus, they're beautiful. \nThe bad: If you're a frequent traveler, you may have to put an addition on the house, something with a lot of wall space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T18:14:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
