Other discounts around the city are also available with the card. \nDe Blasio said the ID promotes a powerful message — that New York is \"a city for everyone.\" \nHe was joined by City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito, who noted that fear is a key factor keeping immigrants from signing up for the ID card. But she said anyone coming forward to obtain one will not be asked about their status. \nMark-Viverito said it's an innovative way for New York to build on its history of \"supporting newcomers.\" \nMore than 30,000 memberships have been redeemed at museums and other cultural institutions since the program's launch. \nIn June, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon applied for a card of his own, saying it would make him \"a real New Yorker.\" \nMore than 50,000 cardholders also have chosen to participate in an organ donor program when applying for the card. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:27:29.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
