The event is scheduled to take place May 27-29, 2016.\n“NAGVA could not be more excited about coming back to Dallas for the third time,” said Jason Fallon, President of NAGVA. ” Dallas has always had such a strong gay volleyball organization throughout the years with DIVA. This carries over to the southern hospitality that Dallas offers to all players who come to the city. We could not be more excited to return to the Lone Star State!”\nThe 2016 NAGVA Championships will be the 10th LGBT sporting event hosted by Dallas since 2004. The last event Dallas hosted was the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Alliance (NAGAAA) Gay Softball World Series in September, 2014.\nThe NAGVA Championships were previously held in Dallas in 1996 and 2005. The inaugural NAGVA Championships took place in 1983 in San Diego and the 2016 Championships in Dallas will be Championships XXXIV (34). The NAGVA Championships attracts 120-plus teams and 1,000-plus athletes. The event will have four divisions compete in pool play for two days followed by double elimination play.\n“We are very happy to host NAGVA for the 2016 Championships,” said Monica Paul, executive director of the Dallas Sports Commission. “We have a great tradition of LGBT and volleyball events here in Dallas and we look forward to welcoming the athletes to our diverse city.”\nThe local host volleyball organization is the Dallas Independent Volleyball Association (DIVA). Formed in 1989, the league has grown to 400 members and we are now one of the largest LGTB volleyball organizations in the United States.\nSource:- Dallas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:21:40.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
