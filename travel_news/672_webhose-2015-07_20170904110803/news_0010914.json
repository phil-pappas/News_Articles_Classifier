Veteran Christie Rampone, 40, and the only player remaining from the 1999 squad, came on for the last five minutes of the contest.\nJapan, nicknamed ‘the Nadeshiko’ – a pink flower symbolising grace and beauty – had won the 2011 crown in dramatic fashion in Frankfurt, Germany.\nThey became the first Asian side to win a World Cup with a victory that embodied the spirit of a nation struggling to recover from a devastating earthquake and tsunami.\nThe United States twice relinquished a one-goal lead before succumbing in a penalty shootout.\nWatch highlights from the heart-stopping first half of the match here.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg6JQxo9TzE"], "published": "2015-07-06T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:48:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
