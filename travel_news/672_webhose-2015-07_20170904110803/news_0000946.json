Like-for-like retail sales grew 4.2pc in the 13 weeks to July 3, adjusted for the timing of Easter, driven by a sterling performance in the retailer’s premium bikes category and cycle repair division. But other divisions also performed well. Travel solutions, previously a weak spot for Halfords, enjoyed an improved performance, on the back of strong sales of roof boxes, cycle carriers and child safety seats. Chief executive Jill McDonald said competitive prices and knowledgeable staff had helped to boost sales. Revenues dipped in the car enhancement category, as a 31pc increase in sales of in-car connectivity equipment and dashboard cameras was offset by weaker car cleaning services in the quarter. But sales momentum in the autocentres was maintained, with like-for-like growth of 4pc, suggesting Halfords' efforts to step up service in the division have paid off. Meanwhile, car maintenance sales grew 5.9pc on a like-for-like basis, with parts up 7pc and workshop revenues running 10pc ahead. Ms McDonald said the positive results showed that Halfords' ‘getting into gear’ turnaround strategy – which put a renewed focus on cycling sales – was on track. \"Our retail business continues to deliver a broad-based top-line performance, against two previous years of strong like-for-like growth. Cycling continues to grow,\" she said. Jill McDonald joined Halfords from McDonald's “In May we opened our fifth Cycle Republic store in Nottingham and there are further openings planned across the country.\" The first quarter was the first full quarter presided over by new boss Jill McDonald , who took over in March after previous CEO Matt Davies was poached to head up Tesco’s UK arm . Ms McDonald was previously McDonald’s UK chief executive and president of its North West Europe division. Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn. Share this article with your network.
