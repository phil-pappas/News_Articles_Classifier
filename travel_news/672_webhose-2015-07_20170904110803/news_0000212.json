And for many, it remains prohibitively costly. \nThe chain of research leading to the potential cure began with two children -- patients of lead researcher Kang Zhang of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou -- from families beset with a congenital, or inherited, form of the condition. Zhang and colleagues discovered that his patients shared a mutation in a gene critical for producing lanosterol, which the researchers suspected might impede cataract-forming proteins from clumping in normal eyes. \nIn a first set of lab experiments on cells, they confirmed their hunch that lanosterol helped ward off the proteins. \nIn subsequent tests, dogs with naturally-occurring cataracts received eye drops containing the molecule. \nAfter six weeks of treatment, the size and characteristic cloudiness of the cataracts had decreased, the researchers reported. \n\"Our study identifies lanosterol as a key molecule in the prevention of lens protein aggregation and points to a novel strategy for cataract prevention and treatment,\" the authors concluded. \nCataracts account for half of blindness cases worldwide. \n\"These are very preliminary findings,\" said J. Fielding Hejtmancik, a scientist at the US National Eye Institute, who wrote a commentary also published in Nature. \n\"Before there are any human trials, the scientists will probably test other molecules to see if they might work even better,\" he told AFP by telephone. \nThe preliminary results, he added, \"doesn't mean that lanosterol is the only or the best compound\" to reduce cataracts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:08:14.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
