The sailings will be under its fathom line, a new brand focused on social impact that will include voluntourism in its itineraries for travel to Cuba and the Dominican Republic, also starting next year.\nThe cruises to Cuba, approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department, fall under the rules that allow licensed travel companies to bring in visitors who will spend their time doing activities that support the Cuban people. Carnival is in talks with Cuban officials to finalize the deal, the company said in a release.\n“We know there is strong demand from travelers who want to immerse themselves in Cuban culture, so this is a historic opportunity for us to enable more people to experience Cuban society,” said Arnold Donald, president and chief executive of the Carnival Corporation.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
