Courtesy intriguemanagement.com News Corp Australia Entertainment Ms Khan claims the pilot called himself ‘the naughty pilot’. Picture: Intrigue Management Source: Supplied \nA PLAYBOY model has dished the dirt about her flight with what could be the world’s sleaziest pilot. \nChloe Khan, also known as Chloe Mafia, claims the married Kuwait Airways captain told a flight attendant to invite her and a friend into the cockpit during the journey from Heathrow to New York’s JFK Airport. \nShe claims he then flouted aviation rules, letting her play with the plane’s controls and smoking during the transatlantic flight. \nThe “stunned” 24-year-old Californian resident, who appeared on the US X Factor show, said he then told her to sit on his knee and begged to see her breasts. She had recently undergone a boob job. \nMs Khan also claims the pilot bragged about bedding half the flight attendants. A photo taken in the cockpit.

He said he lets sexy girls in the cockpit, even though he’s not supposed to, because he ‘made the rules’.” \nShe said he brushed off her concerns about safety. \n“He was showing us what each of the buttons did and said we could sit on his knee and wear his pilot’s cap and fly the plane. I pushed something. I don’t know what it did but he said it was fine as the plane flew itself. \n“He asked if we were in the Mile High Club and said that he was. He was boasting he’d slept with half the stewardesses, which we thought was funny as he wasn’t attractive.” Playboy model Ms Khan.

It has not yet spoken about the allegations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:18:07.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
