Consider these three top hotel districts as an excellent base. \nBooked a flight to London, but still haven’t decided where to make your base? Here are three great districts to choose from! No matter where you book your accommodation, a Gatwick airport taxi will be able to get you in the Central London quickly and without delay. \nWest End– As Central As You Can Get \nIf you’re looking for the sophisticated side of Central London, head straight to the West End. London’s epicentre of attractions (Trafalgar Square is technically the exact geographic nucleus of the area), this is the place to be if you want to be in the heart of the action. \nThe West End is the main commercial and entertainment centre of London, which means this is where you’ll find the most vibrant nightlife. Theatres, cinemas, bars and restaurants abound in this area, particularly around Covent Garden and Leicester Square. Accommodation may be a little expensive here - you’ll find that 4-star hotels dominate listings when it comes to places to stay. But if you haven't already booked, your Gatwick airport taxi driver may be able to offer some insider tips of places to stay that won't break the budget. \nKensington – Museums, Music, Culture and Shopping \nThe district known as Kensington, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, is a wonderful place to stay. It’s a fairly wealthy district, with residents having the highest per capita wealth than anywhere in the United Kingdom, so you definitely won't feel like you're on a budget – even if you stay at one of the cheaper places. \nEven if you’re looking at 4-star accommodation there is a lot to choose from and, once you've arrived in a Gatwick airport taxi, you'll be able to save on transport costs for sightseeing as you're right in the thick of things. Most hop on, hop off sightseeing buses come out to Gloucester Road, or if you’d like to use the Underground, the Piccadilly Line is right there. \nKensington High Street is the main shopping area and it's fabulous shopping - so don’t expect to save money there! But very close by sightseeing, you may want to check out the Kensington Gardens, the amazing public park with Italian and Dutch gardens, and a host of high profile museums in South Kensington. \nVictoria – Fit For a Queen \nFor those who want easy access to the requisite attractions London has to offer, there’s one very central place to stay – the district named after Queen Victoria. Westminster, Buckingham Palace, the Tower of London, London Bridge, the Guards Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum are all within stones' throw of this area. Take in smash hit musicals theatres within walking distance, and there is plenty of shopping to be enjoyed at a host of retail shops. Easily accessible from Gatwick airport, taxi is the easiest way to get to Victoria, although you can also use bus or railway. As for accommodation, it can be a little expensive on weekdays or business convention season (as it is a finance and business area), but prices often go down on weekends. \nIf you're still looking for a place to stay in London, consider any of these three excellent districts.
