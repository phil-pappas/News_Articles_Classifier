Mine was at a 1970 summer fete in Richmond when the announcer of the tombola competition broke off to tell us that British player Roger Taylor had beaten the great Australian Rod Laver in four sets. Applause broke out across Marble Hill Park and it was as if a revolution had taken place and Britain ruled the world again. Unfortunately Taylor’s win had come in the fourth round, not the final and it wasn’t until Andrew Murray’s 2013 win 43 years later that we finally had a male Wimbledon champion. My first Wimbledon final memory came two years later in 1972 when Stan Smith beat bad boy Ilie Nastase over five sets and since then I’ve enjoyed the tournament and seen it as part of the quintessence of an English summer. It was also my first experience of the live internet when working in a London office. In the slow old days of the mid 1990s, it was the IBM scoreboard that was uploaded after every point that made this my digital Wimbledon point of reference. IBM has been working with Wimbledon for the past 25 years and the world has, unlike the people at Marble Hill Park in 1970, indeed undergone a revolution. In these accelerated and constantly changing days, it is unusual for such a long-term commercial relationship to exist, but both seem very happy with it. Not that either partner seem complacent about it. IBM and The All England Club recently announced a combination of ambitious ideas for this year’s Championships to mark the next step in the its digital strategy. Now it is all about the cloud, analytics mobile, social and security, helping to bring tennis fans closer to the Grand Slam event, no matter where they are located; the scoreboard of old almost an afterthought. This involves super-fast access to real-time live scoring, courtside action and insights via a redevelopment and redesign of the website at wimbledon.com and a better mobile apps experience. “With help from IBM, we are providing a world-class digital experience to fans of The Championships. This allows them to get closer to all the action across all of Wimbledon’s 19 courts, no matter where they are, or what device they’re using,” said Mick Desmond, Commercial and Media Director at the All England Club. With 63 million visits to wimbledon.com from around the globe during The Championships 2014, the digital technologies provided in partnership with IBM have to be engaging and interesting enough for visitors to stay around. There is great competition from competing news sites for the visitor’s attention. The personalised Wimbledon apps, available on Apple iPhone, iPad and Android platforms, also have to be engaging for the fan. Providing instant access to scores, player information, match analysis and video (new for 2015), the apps now have an offline mode, so the fan can continue browsing. “Serving up uninterrupted access to real-time Wimbledon match records and trends allows us to showcase the benefits of delivering insights at speed; the digital platform offering instant access to video, scores, articles, interviews and breaking tournament news,” said Sam Seddon, Wimbledon Client and Programme Executive, IBM. IBM is also using Watson to back up its content, and that’s not the gritty, classy and increasingly British player Heather Watson, but the company’s cognitive supercomputer. The Watson Engagement Advisor provides related insights and historical context. Wimbledon staff can also pose questions in natural language and share these insights with fans via social media and the Wimbledon digital platforms. While the cognitive Watson continues to cogitate and the combative Heather Watson still dreams of one day being the first British female Wimbledon champion since Virginia Wade in 1977, the All England Club and IBM continue to serve up digital aces. Perhaps they their doubles act may last for another 25 years. Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn. Share this article with your network.
