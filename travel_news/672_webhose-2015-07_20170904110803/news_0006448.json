Today eTN announced Baros Maldives resort was added to THE LIST. \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \nThe Baros Maldives resort is definitely both luxurious and unique. Recently eTN reported about the Maldives most romantic resort – Baros. \neTN Publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz experienced the Baros Signature Massage for himself and said: \"Having traveled all over the world and having had massage treatments in some of the most renowned and luxurious spas in the world, I have to say that the Baros massage was special and unique. \nThe Baros Signature Massage is a unique marriage of four different massage techniques - Swedish, Thai, Pressure Point, and Hot Stone. The treatment adapts the finer points to the guest’s specific needs. The result? A blissfully rejuvenating experience. \nSteinmetz continued, “We are pleased to add Baros resort and spa in the Maldives islands to THE LIST.” \nMr. Ahmed Shuhan, a Maldivian, born and brought up on an island in the southern Maldivian atoll of Addu is the Baros Resort Manager, and he said: “We are delighted to be part of THE LIST by eTN. Our highest aim is to deliver individual and sincere service to our guests and to be the first choice for couples who are looking for a romantic and peaceful getaway. This award is a great achievement and proof that our efforts are appreciated and successful.” \nFor more information on THE LIST, go to www.honesttravelawards.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:21:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
