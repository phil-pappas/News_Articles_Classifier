Nelson, chief meteorologist at 7News, is the father of PawsCo president and chief operating officer Tiana Nelson, who founded PawsCo two years ago with Kristin Des Marais.\nDes Marais, whose involvement with animal welfare dates back to 2004, when she established Four Paws Pet Center of Colorado, serves as PawsCo's chief executive officer. Four Paws Pet Center of Colorado worked in tandem with the Denver Area Veterinary Medical Society to conduct spay and neuter clinics in underserved communities throughout the state.\nPawsCo continues the spay/neuter effort, and also has foster care and adoption services and an ongoing pet food drive.\nFelicia Diamond, who was at Dog Days of Summer with her husband, dentist Gene Bloom, started what was then called the Furry Friends Pet Food Drive during the economic downturn of 2008; it continues under the leadership of volunteer Andrea Fogel.\nTiana Nelson spearheaded the start of PawsCo's adoptions element; Taylor Vitale volunteers as the adoptions coordinator. Nelson's mom, Cindy, is PawsCo's volunteer development director.\nChuck St. John checks out the silent auction. \"We're a nonprofit that's run like a business,\" Tiana Nelson noted. \"Our 250-plus volunteers are here because we want to save as many companion animals as we can.\"\nWhich in two short years comes to 800.\nJoanne Davidson: 303-809-1314, jdavidson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joannedavidson", "external_links": ["http://casselmans.com/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0716/20150716__20150719_E5_AE19RSVP~p2_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0716/20150716__20150719_E5_AE19RSVP~p3_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:44:50.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
