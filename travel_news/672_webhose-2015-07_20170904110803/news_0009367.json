But this old bird needs to be back at the front, getting herself out there, she’s been fantastic for 21 years and deserves to be out there in the limelight.” Tania Harding Scott Pickett and Christina Harding.

Everyone kept telling me ‘she’s old, let’s get tapas, let’s get this’ and I hated it, I took it personally because she needs to be respected. It was really hard to admit she needed a makeover but it’s true, she did need to be freshened up. We all do as we get older.”\nLast night, viewers saw Christina and daughter Tania — who normally works front of house — score 48 out of 90 for their food and dining experience from their fellow teams and judges Scott Pickett and Tom Parker Bowles.\nWhat they also saw was a touch of Christina and Tania’s fiery personalities, which we’re no doubt destined to see more of during the series.

I’ve probably toned it down a little now, but I have definitely been known to be volatile in the kitchen. I will defend myself to the hilt because my customer is everything to me.”\nOften baring the brunt of Christina’s wrath is her daughter Tania, who has quit working in her mother’s restaurant a fair few times over the years.\n“She’s probably quit more than 20 times,” Christina said, “she’s been fired as well as but she keeps coming back.\n“We’re probably just too similar. I wanted to kill her and she wanted to kill me, when you work with family, it’s really difficult, they don’t like to take orders, think they know better, but there can only be one boss and one person making decisions.\n“But Tania reckons that this show has been like therapy and really cathartic for her, it’s definitely brought us closer together, we’ve begun to talk to each other again.”\nThe Hotplate airs on Channel 9 again tonight at 7.30.
