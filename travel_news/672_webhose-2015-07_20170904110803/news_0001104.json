Source: AFP\nCasillas joined Madrid’s youth academy at the age of 9 and made his debut for its first team in 1999, before going on to become a long-serving captain who was regularly hailed by fans as “Saint Iker” because his daring saves seemed to them almost miraculous.\nCasillas also captained Spain to the 2010 World Cup title - making a key save to deny Arjen Robben in the final against the Netherlands - and helped it win two European championships.\nCasillas’ departure opens the door for a new goalkeeper and Manchester United’s David de Gea has frequently been linked with a return to his hometown, where he played for Atletico Madrid.\nMadrid says Casillas will give a news conference at noon local time on Sunday.\nOnce considered untouchable at Madrid, Casillas was benched by former coach Jose Mourniho in December 2012 and then found it hard to get back in the starting 11 following a hand injury the following month.\nCasillas, 34, was under contract at Madrid until 2017.\nIker Casillas is leaving Madrid after 25 years at the club.

His second European Cup came two years later, when he came on as a second-half substitute to make key saves in the final.\nHe then had to wait until 2014 for the third, but won a long list of trophies in-between.\nCasillas’ exit was unimaginable for most Madrid fans just a couple of years ago, but his stature faded over the last couple of seasons.\nGood Bye Iker Casillas ! #LEGEND pic.twitter.com/MjxQwSuBUs\n— 8 Fact Football (@8Fact_Footballl) July 11, 2015 Mourinho’s successor Carlo Ancelotti kept Casillas as Diego Lopez’s backup in the Spanish league in 2013-14, but played him in the Champions League and Copa del Rey.\nCasillas wore the captain’s armband at Real.

Spain failed to advance past the group stage and Casillas was heavily criticised.\nCasillas was back to starting league games last season, but his performances were constantly scrutinised by many fans who continued to insist he had lost his quick reflexes and confident demeanour.\nSome segments of Madrid’s faithful at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium began jeering Casillas whenever he conceded goals or made dubious moves.\nIker Casillas club honors with Real Madrid: - 5 La Liga. - 3 Champions League. - 2 Copa del Rey. - 1 Club World Cup. pic.twitter.com/ARAfafLIgn\n— Uber Football Facts (@UberFootbalI) July 11, 2015 Madrid’s failure to win a major trophy and the fans’ growing disquiet reportedly prompted club president Florentino Perez to dispense with a player once considered a talisman.\nCasillas’ farewell after 725 matches with Madrid comes in the same summer that friend and rival Xavi Hernandez left Barcelona to play in Qatar.\nCasillas’ future with the Spanish national team will now be questioned even further, as coach Vicente del Bosque carries out his “sweet revolution” to rejuvenate the side for the 2016 Euros in France. He is still Del Bosque’s No. 1 ‘keeper, but that could change if De Gea continues to make strides.\nCasillas with the Champions League trophy.
