The potatoes, greens – runner beans and peas – and carrots were prepared by Ebernoe’s tea lady, Jean Stemp, who happens to be an expert on the history of the club and its Horn Fair. Jean also produced three wonderful desserts – banoffee pie, meringue pie and apple pie. All utterly delicious. Jean doubles up as captain of the brilliant refreshments marquee, which is available to players and their families. It offers an array of food: ploughman’s lunches, delicious traditional sandwiches and a generous spread of homemade cakes from many of the villagers – scones, rock cakes and Victoria sponges. “We are very lucky to have Jean.
