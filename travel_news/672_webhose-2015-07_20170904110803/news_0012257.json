The catch? You'll have to scale a nearly 1,000-foot cliff face to get there . \nGulp . Natura Vive \nPeru-based tour company Natura Vive operates the three Skylodge pods, which have four beds each. \nTravelers usually begin their stay with a dizzying climb up to the pods via a series of metal ladders and cables. Visitors also have the option to hike a daunting trail to the top. Natura Vive \nWhen guests arrive, they're met with views spanning Peru's famed Sacred Valley , known for its isolated villages and dangerous, narrow roads. They're served a gourmet dinner in their pod (complete with wine), will sleep literally under the stars and then awaken to a breakfast picnic on the roof of their pod. \nAt the end of each stay, a series of zip lines delivers guests back to the valley floor. \nThe best part? This whole experience -- getting up, getting down and spending the night -- costs just about $300 dollars per person , making it a priceless experience with a reasonable price.
