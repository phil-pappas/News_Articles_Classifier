The gym attendant was a teenager at that time. Now a middle-aged balding man in tip-top shape always remembers me by name - even after 30 years. \nThe uniformed bellmen are more than someone opening your hotel door or carrying your luggage in and out of a taxi. They personify that personal touch that impeccable hotels provide for their guests. \nThe front desk staff is attentive to put it lightly. Every time you walk by the lobby, you will see them smiling and going out of their way to make any little difference they can to make your stay memorable. Most remembered my name. \nThis smile is also very much visible by the maids who prepare your room. Over the years maids often remembered me, even if I did not stay at the hotel for a year or more.\" \n“We are proud of being awarded addition to THE LIST. Since opening in 1970, Dusit Thani Bangkok has always aim to deliver distinctive service that featured Thai artistry and graciousness. Centrally located in the heart of Bangkok, Dusit Thani Bangkok is a popular venue for weddings and conventions”, Sukanya Janchoo, General Manager of Dusit Thani Bangkok said. \nThe Mayflower: eTN Publisher's favorite Chinese restaurant at the Dusit Thani:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:38:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
