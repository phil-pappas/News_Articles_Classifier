From golf to basketball, cricket to croquet, ten-pins to table tennis, guests will be able to experience many of the historic pastimes of the late 1800s and early 1900s. Battledore and shuttlecock and draughts are examples of some of the many activities offered that are precursors to sports and games enjoyed today. There will also be many games played by early Wisconsin immigrants, like topfschlagen and hoppe tau.\n“Game On!” will kick off August 1 with a historic base ball match on the site’s new field, with Old World Wisconsin’s Eagle Diamonds hosting the Wade House Red Jackets. The match begins at 1:30 pm and admission to the game is included with admission to Old World Wisconsin.\nDan Freas, director of the popular regional history attraction, shared the Old World Wisconsin team’s enthusiasm for “Game On!”: “This is definitely going to be one of our most engaging and interactive experiences. While we carefully researched each of the activities, ‘fun’ was our byword when determining what to include. We scheduled ‘Game On!’ during August through Labor Day, before back-to-school time, to provide families with many different ways to unplug and reconnect and stretch out their summer fun. We expect much laughter and lots of giggles!”\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Old World Wisconsin introduces “Catch Wheel Fever!” – a new event Old World Wisconsin launches summer 2014 – “Time Travelers Adventure Camp” Pioneer Power: Old World Wisconsin shares 19th-century technology at Wisconsin Science Festival New visitor guide leaves no stone unturned on the Sunshine Coast", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T18:03:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
