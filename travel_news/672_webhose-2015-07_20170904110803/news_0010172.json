For Vinicius Lummertz, president of Embratur (Brazilian Tourism Board), visa-free travel for Americans later this year and in 2016 will help to increase the number of visitors during the Rio 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. \nBrazil's membership into the Global Entry Program was announced on Tuesday (June 30th), during joint statement by presidents Dilma Rousseff and Barack Obama. The program will be implemented by the first half of 2016 and will allow quick access for Brazilians when arriving at the United States. Travelers entering the country will be able to use automated kiosks instead of going through immigration officials. In order to use the system when in operation, an early registration is required. \nVisa waiver for Americans has been discussed by the Ministry of Tourism and Embratur with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to Tourism Minister Henrique Eduardo Alves, the idea is to start with the United States, as one of the countries that send the most tourists to Brazil. The request for visa exemption for American tourists was delivered to the Foreign Minister, Mauro Vieira in May. \n\"The exemption will increase Brazil's competitiveness in international tourism,\" said Lummertz. In 2013, according to the Ministry of Tourism, 592,000 Americans visited Brazil, of which 34.8% were on a business trip or attending events, and 18.6% for leisure. 69% had visited the country before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:16:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
