Angels @ Mariners, 1:10 p.m., ROOT Sports\nIn his latest attempt to stick with the big-league club, Montero isn’t expecting to play the field much — he is primarily a designated hitter — but Mariners manager Lloyd McClendon noticed progress from Montero’s first start at first base Friday night.\nMost Read Stories How Edgar Martinez is already making Mariners hitters better Traffic death of boy stirs outcry in Issaquah Mount St. Helens, still steaming, holds the world’s newest glacier The jury’s in: ‘True Detective’ Season 2 is not so hot Bush’s 'work longer hours’ remark may follow him for a long time “He looked like he’s moving better,” McClendon said Saturday. “He looked a lot more comfortable at the plate. We’ll see how it plays at this level.”\nMontero, a one-time top prospect, was called up from Class AAA Tacoma on Thursday and went 1 for 3 Friday in his season debut with the Mariners.\n“He’s going to get the opportunity to play against left-handers,” McClendon said, “and we’ll see what happens.”\nAckley heating up again Dustin Ackley’s recent surge is an encouraging sign for the Mariners — and not an unexpected one.\nAs a part-time outfielder, Ackley is hitting .400 (12 for 30) with seven runs, two doubles, one triple, two home runs, six RBI and a 1.188 on-base plus slugging percentage since June 21.\nHe was hitting .177 (20 for 113) in his first 43 games of the season.\n“He’s a second-half player,” McClendon said. “He’s starting to come on.”\nAckley’s career numbers support that. From 2012 to 2014, Ackley had a .223 batting average and a .601 OPS before the All-Star break; after the break, he hit .257 with a .717 OPS.\n“He leaves you scratching your head sometimes,” McClendon said. “Right now, he’s swinging the bat pretty good.”\nA happy birthday, indeed She didn’t quite hit her age on the radar gun, but Mariners fan Evelyn Jones made a flash of history by becoming the oldest person to throw out a ceremonial first pitch before a major-league game.\nCelebrating her 108th birthday Saturday, Jones received red-carpet treatment for her walk out toward home plate. She received a standing ovation from the Safeco crowd and then, at her request, a hug from Felix Hernandez.\nAfter her short, soft toss to Hernandez, the crowd then sang “Happy Birthday,” with balloons and a cake brought out for her.\nNOTES • McClendon reiterated there isn’t a timetable for left-hander James Paxton to return from the disabled list — offering only, “It’s going to take awhile.” Paxton, on the DL since May 29 with a strained tendon in his middle finger, has been playing catch but has yet to throw off a mound.\n• The Mariners have signed former Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang to a minor-league deal and assigned him to Class AAA Tacoma. The 35-year-old right-hander had his best years in 2006 and ’07 in New York, posting 19 victories each of those seasons. His career has been marred by injuries since, and he last appeared in the majors with the Blue Jays in 2013. In June, Wang signed with the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the independent Atlantic League, posting a 2.49 ERA in three starts.\nAdam Jude: 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com .
