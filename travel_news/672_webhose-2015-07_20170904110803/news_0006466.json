Over 100 artists have contributed artwork throughout the building including the chalkboard ceiling in the restaurant, an ongoing project featuring artwork inspired by their mothers.\nGuests will have access to rental scooters and bikes as well as a rooftop fitness center, opening in September, inspired by the outdoor gyms on Venice Beach. Rooms start at $149 per night and include 27-inch iMacs that serve as both televisions and computers, and copies of screenplays based in Los Angeles such as “The Big Lebowski.”\nOwned by the Trigano family, original developers of Club Med resorts, the boutique brand also operates in Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux and Istanbul.\nDIVE TO THE MUSIC\nRather than listening to their own Darth Vader-like breaths in the water, scuba divers at Looe Key in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary can swim to music next Saturday, July 11, during the annual Lower Keys Underwater Music Festiva l.\nFrom 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time, the radio station WWUS, known as US1-Radio, will broadcast marine-themed hits like “Yellow Submarine” by the Beatles and “Fins” by Jimmy Buffett via underwater speakers from boats stationed at Looe Key Reef, roughly six miles south of Big Pine Key. At the surface, snorkelers can also catch the broadcast.\nThe one-day event, now in its 31st year, aims to highlight reef protection in a festive atmosphere that often draws divers costumed as mermaids, pirates or rock stars.\n“It’s just one of the ways we celebrate our reef and reef preservation,” Gayle Tippet said, co-owner of Strike Zone Charters in Big Pine Key. The operator offers a 9 a.m. Eastern departure next Saturday to catch the festival, costing $38 for snorkelers and $48 for divers, before equipment.\nPAN AM PARTIES IN TORONTO\nWhile the 2015 Women’s World Cup matches hopscotched around Canada, the six-city circuit skipped Toronto, which was busy preparing for its own moment in the sports spotlight with the Pan Am Games , beginning Friday, July 10, and running through July 26.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The third largest international multisport games, after the Olympics and the Asian Games, will draw over 7,000 athletes from 41 countries and territories throughout North, Central and South America.
