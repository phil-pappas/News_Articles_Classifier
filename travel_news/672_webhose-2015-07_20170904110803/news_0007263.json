Kevin McCloud follows the construction of amazing homes, from initial idea to end result. Picture: Chris Scott Source: News Limited\nGRAND DESIGNS\nIt’s a show about people building spectacular homes, usually over budget and well past schedule. Architectural guru Kevin McCloud this week patiently follows the ambition of a couple who clearly have too much money. Their plans to build an “urban shed” out of corrugated cement fibre board in the middle of London get out of hand — not least because they’re doing stuff without the approval of authorities.

Caitlyn Jenner is one of the most talked about women in the world right now. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nI AM CAIT\nI got a sneak peek at the first episode of this documentary reality series, and it’s good. Yes, there are Kardashians involved, but unlike their shows, this is real. It’s very raw, emotional and in depth. Very little seems off limits. And Caitlyn Jenner is one of the most talked about people in the world right now, so it’s utterly fascinating. This series begins in the days after Caitlyn introduced herself via that now famous Vanity Fair cover. Monday, 9.30pm, E!\nHonourable mention for guilty pleasure viewing: Ramsay’s Hotel Hell on Seven on Monday at 8.30pm. I don’t know what makes chef Gordon Ramsay qualified to critique awful hotels ... but in any case, it’s compelling viewing.

Tuesday, 8.30pm, SBS\nHonourable mention for guilty pleasure viewing: Embarrassing Bodies Down Under on Nine on Tuesday at 9pm. I once had a mole on my stomach that I was super selfconscious about. After watching this show, I don’t know why I was ever bothered.\nHopefuls ... five teams will battle it out for dining glory in Restaurant Revolution. Source: Channel 7\nRESTAURANT REVOLUTION\nYes, it’s another cooking reality TV show ... but this one is a bit different to the rest. It follows five teams as they turn an empty shipping container into a pop-up restaurant, serving hundreds of regular punters. Whoever makes the most successful business will win a grand cash prize, which they can use to make their hospitality dreams come true.

Source: Supplied\nGLITCH\nThe mysterious story continues to unfold, as a group of once-dead and now very alive people struggle to understand why they’re suddenly back in the land of the living. But it’s increasingly clear there’s more going on here, as a country cop turns super weird. What’s he up to? We’ll find out eventually, I guess. The pace of this series is all over the shop and I’m starting to lose interest again, but we’ve come this far, so ... Thursday, 8.30pm, ABC\nHonourable mention for guilty pleasure viewing: The Bachelor Australia on Thursday on Ten at 7.30pm. On the one hand, this show makes me uncomfortable ... it’s a bunch of girls vying for the ‘love’ of one bloke. On the other hand, the cray cray drama that unfolds makes great TV.\nThese guys ... the infectious energy and chemistry of The Living Room team only makes it more enjoyable to watch. Source: Supplied\nTHE LIVING ROOM\nEven if you’re not handy around the house, this show is fun to watch. It’s kind of like eating take-out while watching a cooking program.

Friday, 7.30pm, Ten\nHonourable mention for guilty pleasure viewing: If You Are The One on Friday on SBS2 at 6.30pm. Seriously, you have to give this a go if you’ve not already. It’s a Chinese dating game show.\nWeird and wonderful ... Celebrity Chef is a Chinese reality TV show that makes for entertaining viewing. Source: Supplied\nCELEBRITY CHEF\nI was going to put this down as a ‘guilty pleasure’ show but there’s actually some substance here, among the fair dose of odd that you’d expect from a Chinese reality TV show. Basically, a bunch of local celebs — all massive foodies — are tutored by a Michelin-star chef ahead of a serious of studio-based culinary challenges. The tasks are epic and the food looks delicious. Saturday, 6.10pm, SBS2\nHonourable mention for guilty pleasure viewing: Caught Red-Handed on Saturday on CI Network at 5.30pm.
