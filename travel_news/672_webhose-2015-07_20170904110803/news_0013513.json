The vast number of top quality venues in this great city is simply staggering and it’s high time that we honour this fact with an official award programme. “The members of our judging panel have been working hard to find the venues that have gone above and beyond, so I look forward to finding out who the winners will be in October.” A full list of the shortlisted venues can be found below.
