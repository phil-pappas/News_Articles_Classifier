Cruises from Galveston — These cruises can take people all over the world and are very popular for southern Oklahomans this year. Cruises give vacationers options of travelling to destinations in Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas along with Honduras and Belise. The cruise lines include Carnival, Disney and Royal Carribean. Some cruises even feature live bands. 2. Mexico ­— For travelers flying out this summer, Mexio has been a hot spot for many. Destinations include Cozumel and Cancun. These are popular because of the beautiful resorts and beaches available to travelers. Triciclistas are available to hire for help with heavy luggage when getting from airports to ferrys. Once at the pier of your destination taxis are available to carry tourists to and from their resort. 3. Jamaica — The long sandy beaches and crystal clear waters of Jamaica make it a popular vacation spot for travelers looking to relax and kick-back this season. Jamaica also has mountains that are great for hiking and exploring. This destination is great for families looking for fun and adventure while obtaining a cultural experience through cuisine, art and local festivals. 4. Punta Cana — This resort is located on the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic. Vacationers looking to try something new and different have been jumping at the opportunity to explore this gorgeous resort. The most popular time for travelers is between December and April meaning hotel and travel prices are at their low during the summer months. The official language of the island is Spanish and the locals are known to be very friendly. The island is one of the safer travel places this summer. 5. Florida — Key West, Pensacola and Orlando are top vacation spots in the continental U.S. this season. All three cater to tourists and have beaches for exploring. Right now airfare is discounted and for those afraid of heights, Florida is one of the places on the list where flying is not necessary.     1:00 PM Updated at 1:08 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:39:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
