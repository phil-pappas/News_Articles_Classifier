Eva Riedler, whose doppelganger is the famous American TV chef, even has the same sort of shrill yet strangely reassuring voice. She laughs at her own jokes. This should not be a good thing. But she's a riot. Climbing aboard the bus at the port of Linz, bound for Salzburg, I make a beeline for a seat at the back, in case I have to have to unlock from the mother ship and tune out. I've seen trips like this before in which tourists are lead around like terrified toddlers by people holding giant lollipops. But our Eva prefers to go off script. \"We will stop along the way at a cafe,\" she says, \"where you must pay for your coffee as you leave in the souvenir shop. Why? So you are tempted to buy some junk.\" Salzburg is listed as one of the top 10 places you must see before you die. Even in the dreary rain it's spectacular. MOZART'S PLACE The Sound of Music was filmed here and it was the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. \nSarah Daniell eschews the comforts of onboard life to cycle from Durnstein to Melk alongside the Danube. \nHe is the greatest genius of all time, Eva declares. Mozart may have revolutionised the art world, but he's been pimped out for the tourist industry. He's everywhere - on matchboxes, music boxes and chocolate balls. He's standing, bronze and weathered, in Mozartplatz; he's a snow-dome and a fridge magnet. He's all over umbrellas. I buy one covered in musical notes. We take a walk among the melancholic stone angels in Mirabell Palace Gardens. \nFrom here it's a great view up to Festung Hohensalzburg (Salzburg Fortress) and there's an option to take the funicular for a close encounter. But castles are much more majestic from afar. Up close they lose their scale. READ MORE * Beauty and kindness in Budapest I discover this a few days earlier, on a cycling trip form Durnstein to Melk. There in the distance was the magnificent 12 th century Ruine Aggsteni, in the Wachau Valley. It sits at 480 metres. Seeing it up close later that day it's diminished, ruined by a cheesy tourist shop selling postcards and medieval children's weapons. So in Salzburg I opt to meander alone around an enclave of winding, cobbled streets and alleyways. \"If you liked the trip to Salzburg,\" says Eva, \"write it down. And if you didn't, keep your mouth shut. \"I've really enjoyed today,\" she adds. \"You coulda given me hell. \" \nCastle-encrusted Salzburg, with Eva, is just one of the many excellent and varied diversions on a tour on board the Scenic Jasper for its christening voyage on the grand Danube – a 3000km liquid highway that flows through 10 countries. It begins in the Black Forest, in Germany and ends in the Black Sea. \nThe Mirabel Gardens and Salzburg castle display the sort of beauty which makes this part of Europe such a tourist trap. \nWe begin in Vienna and end in Budapest. \nAt Wien we up anchor after the captain smashes a bottle of champagne at the bow and a priest says a prayer. Here the river changes from the Upper to the Lower Danube. THE BLUE DANUBE To travel by riverboat is to see borderless Europe in a pan-shot. We glide past extravagant ruins and villages that render you weak-kneed at their beauty. \nWe're not alone, of course. The Danube is so heavily canalised that only 30 percent of the river is free flowing. There are many other riverboats, but there is never a sense of being crowded. Sarah Daniell \nSome views, like this ruin in Durnstein, are best appreciated from a distance. \nWe wake on our first morning in Durstein, where a medieval castle sits above a village apparently jutting out of rock. I wander around the village and buy some postcards before joining my fellow passengers and jumping on a pushbike for the long ride to Melk. Ad Feedback \nWe're an unruly sort of group of about 40 of varying fitness levels and expectations. Some take the motorised pushbikes on offer which look impressive enough - white, shiny and fast. \nIt all sounds good on paper. Five minutes in, however, I'm glad I chose the old-school pedal-powered bicycle, for the others seem to spend the first part of the four-hour journey getting to grips with the gears and throttle and being yelled at by our German guide. \"Keep up, keep up,\" she cries, getting increasingly frustrated. \nI join a small bunch off renegades, longing to get a pace on. We follow the river, stopping at villages, and a little oasis which serves cold beer. Four hours later, ravenous and weary, we meet the ship, and dive into a sprawling smorgasbord lunch. \nSPACE SHIP LIFE \nThe 135m Jasper, part of Scenic's fleet of \"space ships\", has earthly joys in abundance, such as endless champagne, or snacks at whatever random time of the day or night takes your fancy. \nIt's heaving with guests – 150 of them – but it's cleverly designed and spacious. \nThere is an island bar and several dining areas, offering smorgasbord to a la carte and degustation. There is an impressive wine cellar. \nThe decor is redolent of a power-dressed 90s boardroom – all chrome and black with salt-and-pepper coloured concertina curtains. \nIn my suite in the Upper Diamond Deck there are disco lights in the shower so you can dance while being waterboarded by three strategically placed shower jets. Extreme showering on the Danube. \nEvery day, housekeeping leave a towel animal creation on my bed. On the first day, it's a swan, wearing my spectacles. There's also a letter on my bed, from my butler. \n\"Miss Daniell\", it begins, \"I am delighted to be your butler. Allow me to welcome you aboard. Should you need any assistance, please contact me any time …\" \nIt explains that complimentary services include five-star all-inclusive beverage offering; shoe shining; two garments pressed daily; mini bar restocked daily; a six-course degustation at Table La Rive\". \nSold. Welcome aboard HMS Hedonism. \nI take a photo of the letter and text it to my sister, in London. \"Are you f...ing kidding me?\" she replies. \nI will not need the shoe-shining or the garment pressing. But I do order tea every morning, which I take on my private balcony. \nWe slip into slip into Hungary, our last stop, by night. The Danube has become a neon river, the lights from the twin cities, Buda and Pest, play on the water like a shimmering welcoming party. \nI have a speed date with Budapest and I fall in love. \nBUDA + PEST \nThe next morning, I walk across Elisabeth Bridge, from Buda, where we are moored, and into Pest. There are scars all over the city from past wars and \"man's inhumanity to man\", as Robert Burns put it. \nPast the Jewish Quarter, following cobbled pathways past curved buildings, I walk on to a gypsy market where stall holders sell glass beads and hand-loomed scarves. It's Sunday and Hungarians sit around eating lunch at the many outside cafes. \nWhat do you do when you have one night in Budapest? Take a journey down the rabbit hole to \"Szimpla\" - a labyrinth of bars and a riot of colour that takes our group of four about half an hour to find. We get conflicting directions, but we are determined and we are, eventually, rewarded. \nSzimpla is full of hipsters, weird props and rickety chairs. It's a devastatingly cool and creative use of a disused inner city space. \nZsombor, the barman, is channelling Jean Renault in The Assassin. In a deep monotone, and without looking up, he says if I want a mojito I must go elsewhere. Maybe he means Cuba. I settle for a Hungarian riesling. \nA drunk man is drinking a green pina colada. \"You should get one! I'm from Wales.\" Could I teach him Hungarian? \nIt's time to find a cab and return to the floating hotel for the last time, to sleep on the same river, in another country, in borderless Europe. \nIF YOU GO \nScenic will operate 15-day Jewels of Europe river cruises from Amsterdam to Budapest on next-generation \"space ships\" in 2016, including Scenic Jasper, from $7635 per person twin-share. Book by July 31 this year for early bird deals such as free international flights plus, on new bookings, a complimentary hotel night pre or post cruise.
