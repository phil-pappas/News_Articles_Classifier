Crews were able to open up the northbound lane of I-15 about 45 minutes later, with southbound I-15 opening 40 minutes after that. \nThe blaze is one of the state's first big fires of the season. Fire officials have dubbed it the Scipio Summit Fire. \n— Cassidy Hansen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T08:32:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
