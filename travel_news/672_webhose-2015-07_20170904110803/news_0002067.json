I’m hoping against hope it is LETTER FROM CAPE TOWN: Ordinary people bear brunt of union turmoil In this article Companies and organisations: Economic Freedom Fighters | Democratic Alliance | African National Congress People: Pravin Gordhan IT IS a truism of South African politics that we will not be sure we live in a democracy until the African National Congress (ANC) loses an election and willingly hands over power. The jury is still out on the issue more than 20 years after the first democratic poll — despite the party having lost control of the Western Cape, because it was never really in a majority here, having governed in an unholy alliance with the New National Party.\nIt is debatable how willingly it gave up power even then: there have been numerous attempts to bring down successive Democratic Alliance (DA)-led governments at the provincial and municipal level in the Western Cape outside the election process, some of them using blatantly unethical and even illegal methods. But that is relevant only in how it pertains to legitimate \"regime change\" in future, especially in the light of next year’s local government election.\nIt is common cause that the days of overwhelming ANC majorities are over, in some provinces at least. In addition to the DA pounding on the door in Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg and Tshwane, as well as a number of smaller towns in the Eastern and Western Cape, coalition politics are likely to spread northwards as the Economic Freedom Fighters and United Front contest municipal polls for the first time.\nThe ANC’s hegemony is being eroded from all sides, and while it can be expected to retain control of the middle ground and therefore the lion’s share of power for some time, it will no longer be unfettered.\nThe developments of the past few weeks in Oudtshoorn, controlled by an ANC-led alliance until corruption, mismanagement and the collapse of service delivery resulted in a political realignment that saw the DA gain a majority in the council with the support of smaller parties, are instructive.\nAt first blush, it has been an open-and-shut case of the ANC doing what some fear will be the response when the party eventually loses power nationally — it simply refused to hand over power.\nThe usual process when a party loses its majority through losing a by-election, as happened in Oudtshoorn, is that a motion of no confidence in the mayor and other office-bearers is tabled at the next council meeting and a new coterie is elected.\nBut in this case, the incumbent officials would not allow such a meeting to take place and declined to move out of their offices. This stalemate endured for several weeks while the town fell apart and increasingly irate correspondence took place between the province and central government.\nIt was only when it emerged that the Cango Caves would have to be closed to visitors due to the disappearance of funds intended for the tourist attraction’s upkeep that Co-operative Governance Minister Pravin Gordhan stepped in.\nThe long-delayed council meeting and vote of no confidence took place last week, a DA mayor was sworn in and settled into his office on Monday, and an emergency budget and service delivery recovery plan have been approved.\nIt was all scandalously late, and much damage has been done to the credibility of local government as an institution due to the ANC’s shenanigans, but the transfer of power has finally taken place. Democracy has been restored, and while the provincial ANC’s obstructive role in this saga is worrying and accountability has yet to be enforced, it is encouraging that central government eventually did the right thing.\nA precedent has been set, one that may have to be hauled out and put on prominent display in the coming few years.\nIt is equally important that a thorough forensic audit be carried out in Oudtshoorn to determine why exactly those officials were so reluctant to vacate their offices. I have a feeling it may find it had more to do with a need for individuals to cover their tracks than a desire for the party to cling to political power for its own sake.\nMeanwhile, Western Cape ANC leader Marius Fransman has been re-elected unopposed, as has Congress of South African Trade Unions provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich. While there has been an attempt to paper over the cracks in the alliance, it is clear from their rhetoric that not much has changed.\nUnity in Diversity, an ANC splinter group that has campaigned against the politics of deployment and factionalism, has its work cut out as long as the provincial leadership remains substantially the same. The party’s fate in the Western Cape will be repeated elsewhere unless there is a change in its attitude to democracy and understanding of the role of a governing party.\n• Marrs is Cape editor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:43:10.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
