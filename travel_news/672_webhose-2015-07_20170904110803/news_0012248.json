Katherine Lawrey reports \nIf you are ever walking in rural Cyprus, near the village of Kathikas, and stumble across a cave stocked with wine, resist the temptation to take any. The natural wine cellar belongs to winemaker, Savvas Chrysanthou, whose family has been making wine for multiple generations. During a tasting session at his Sterna Winery, he explains the rationale of keeping the wine in the cave: “It’s always 16C and dark,” he says. “There’s no need for an extra cooler. It’s good for keeping the wine long-term and it’s free storage. Nobody else has a natural wine cellar like it in Cyprus,” he adds proudly. \nHis grandfather was a winemaker in the days before electricity, when the entire process was executed using traditional methods. Once picked, the grapes were transported on the backs of donkeys, and crushed by foot on the roofs of the caves where they would be fermented and stored. \nHis ancestors used to barter with wine and exchange it for consumables such as olive oil. \nI look around a small museum which highlights these traditional methods, and then it’s down to the serious business of tasting, a full-bodied red muscat, which Chrysanthou explains is single-pressedfor better quality. Cheap wine is twice pressed, he says, barely able to disguise his disdain. \nChrysanthou makes 85,000 bottles a year - red, white and rose - he keeps half for visitors, and the rest he sells in supermarkets and restaurantsaround Coral Bay, Paphos and Polis. \nThe winery has been recommended to me by Angela, the island manager for Sunvil. She has lived in Cyprus for about 15 years, knows it like the back of her hands and has a long list of typically Cypriot experiences that she recommends to Sunvil guests. She wants to help them get the most from their holiday on the island and she wants them to put euros directly into the hands of local businesses. \n“Clients often ask me where are the best places to go for local produce and traditional crafts. Ninety per cent of our guests hire cars so they will get out and tour the villages,” she says. “We put Cypriot wine and cheese in the grocery packs in villas. We promote the real Cyprus and westand by that,” she says. “Clients do care and they do expect it.” \nAngela is a driving force behind the Cyprus Sustainable Tourism Initiative (CSTI), which was set up in 2006, with the support of the Cyprus Tourism Organisation and the Travel Foundation. It counts individuals, hotels and suppliers as members, and they collaborate on projects, with the aim of making the island a leader in sustainable tourism. These include the setting of minimum standards for sustainability, encouraging hotels to offer a “Cyprus breakfast” made by local suppliers, and the development of self-drive routes to inspire visitors to discover rural Cyprus. \nAngela admits they have started from a low baseline: “Cyprus is one of the world’s worst producers of rubbish,” she admits, “and plastics are not widely recycled, but that is changing, slowly. We’ve gone into schools to educate the children, so they go home and educate their parents.” \nCSTI member Nissi Beach Resort in Ayia Napa, she says, is “an excellent example of sustainability in action”. Energy-saving lamps have beeninstalled; water-saving devices have been installed in guest bathrooms; waste water is treated and used to irrigate gardens; in the kitchenresponsible purchasing decisions support farmers; and sunbeds are made from recycled materials. Eco-chic Droushia Heights \nAnother member is Droushia Heights - a self-styled “eco-chic” hotel, perched on a hill in the northwest corner of Cyprus. At the rear of the hotel, there’s a large terrace, with a big swimming pool, which has sweeping views of the sea, the valley and mountains behind. Nestled in the countryside, Droushia Heights is an ideal base for hikers, cyclists and nature lovers, and the unpolluted night sky makes star gazing a regular treat. The hotel’s restaurant serves a mixture of local and international dishes, and with rural Cyprus on the doorstep, it’s easy for guests to seek out the traditional way of life and local food in village coffee shops and tavernas. \nMultiple green changes have been implemented within Sunvil’s own Cyprus Villa Collection, such as solar water heating, the use of energy saving lightbulbs, and persuading clients to use reusable shopping bags. “We have to say no to plastic bags - they end up in the sea and kill our marine life,” Angela says. “I come from Canada, where there is zero tolerance on rubbish,” she says. “I will spend hours cleaning litter from around the villas. If we let it pile up, Cyprus becomes an island of rubbish. We have so much natural beauty here - that is all we need to advertise for people to come here - so we must protect it.” The big cheese \nAfter Sterna Winery, Angela takes me to see two more local enterprises. One is Droushia Dairy, a family-run business that churns out 240kg of cheese every week. In addition to the Cypriot staple of halloumi, made from a mixture of goat and sheep’s milk, the dairy also makes Anari cheese, a ricotta-style, soft whey cheese. The fumes from the giant vats of warming goats milk are overpowering, and there’s a language barrier that stops me finding out exactly how the cheese is made - but all I really need to know is how good it tastes. And I’ve rarelytasted better. Cypriots like to eat halloumi in summer with watermelon, and it’s an integral part of the meze plate. Droushia Dairy sells its cheeseto supermarkets and restaurants all over the island, and if you come to the door, you can buy a kilogram for €11. Heaven on Earth \nThe other place we visit is Heaven on Earth Herbals, the livelihood of herbalist Caroline Evans. She uses the herbs in her garden to make teas, tonics, creams and oils, which she sells in her apothecary. The lotions and potions are lined up like a sweet shop, promising cures for sleep deficiencies, muscle aches and pains, skin disorders and digestive conditions. I can’t say to what extent they all work - but I can vouch for the “guilt-free” cakes, served in the convivial surroundings of her herb garden, a tranquil haven filled with soothing bird song. Handing us the menu, Caroline apologises for the physical appearance of the cakes: “Excuse the cakes, they are not perfect looking slices, but they are gluten-free,organic and good for you.” No excuses are needed - the cheeky chilli chocolate and the virtuouso vegan rawfood carrot cakes are delicious. \nAs she clears the plates, we shareour appreciation of the cakes: “People often say they haven’t tasted cakes quite so good,” she says, “butwe won’t give the recipes away.” It dawns on me that Cyprus is an island of secrets - with its hidden wine caves, hallowed halloumi and mysterious cake recipes - but these are the best kind of secrets, because they make Cyprus a special holiday experience all of its own. \nBook it : Sunvil Holidays offers seven nights at Villa Buffavento (sleeps six) located in Pomos from £810pp (based on two sharing) departing in October.
