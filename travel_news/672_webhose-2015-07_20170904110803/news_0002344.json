The bondholders, who include many pensioners, fear losing irreplaceable income streams as the bonds pay interest of as much as 16pc. • Lloyds accused of 'outrageous abuse of savers' as it tries to close top-paying bonds Lloyds has argued that changes in the regulatory landscape mean that the bonds – technically known as \"enhanced capital notes\" or ECNs – no longer count as part of the bank's capital reserves and that the contract under which they were issued entitles it to redeem them at \"par\" or face value as a result. But last month the High Court rejected this view . The bank has lodged an appeal and sought an \"expedited\" hearing the Appeal Court. Interest on the bonds costs Lloyds about £1m a day. Bank analysts are divided over the bank's chances of success. \"We maintain our view that Lloyds are unlikely to win their appeal,\" said Olly Burrows, an analyst at CRT Capital, a US-based broker. In a research note entitled \"One may smile, and smile, and be a villain \", Mr Burrows said he \"strongly disagreed\" with Lloyds' justification for the compulsory repurchase, calling it \"flawed\". \"It was surprising how few investors were initially interested in challenging Lloyds in this matter,\" he said. \"It seems clear that many in the market simply accepted that Lloyds’ version of events [that the bonds no longer counted as capital] was true and that they were therefore legally entitled to call [repurchase] the ECNs at par. We strongly disagree with this.\" He added that if it won its appeal and went ahead with the bond cancellation at par value, it would \"join the list of banks labelled ‘not bondholder friendly’ \". However, analysts at Nomura disagreed. Calling the High Court verdict \"bizarre\", they said: \"We think that Lloyds will either win its appeal or the [regulator] will explicitly say that ECNs are ineligible for future stress tests [of capital].\" The latter would answer the point made by the High Court judge, who said that just because regulators had not taken the bonds into account in previous stress tests did not mean they would always be disregarded. A spokesman for Lloyds said: \"The group has now filed its appeal. Until the conclusion of any further court proceedings, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\" • For fund tips and investment ideas, sign up to our weekly Investor newsletter Follow @telegraph The Telegraph Investor Transfer your Isas - buy & sell funds for free Find out more »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:52:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
