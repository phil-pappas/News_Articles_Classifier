Since joining the Port Commission in 2013, Gregoire has been an effective and pragmatic overseer. ...\"\nSimultaneously, the Port’s plan to upgrade Sea-Tac’s international arrival facility has mushroomed into a $600 million megaproject and pitted its biggest airline tenants against each other.\nStrong and capable leaders are needed to guide the Port through these storms and ensure its continued support of industries that are a cornerstone of the region’s economy and a crucial source of middle-class jobs.\nIn the race for Position No. 2 on the Port Commission, the clear choice is Courtney Gregoire, a former federal trade official now employed as a senior attorney at Microsoft.\nGregoire is the daughter of a former governor, but she has built an impressive career of her own. Since joining the Port Commission in 2013, Gregoire has been an effective and pragmatic overseer.\nDuring her term, the Port agreed to a historic partnership with the Port of Tacoma, creating a regional alliance to better compete for shipping business. Gregoire said the collaboration was necessary, but more work is needed to sort out arrangements.\nIn addition to advocating for the Port’s economic-development role, Gregoire has pushed to improve its environmental standing.\nBut Gregoire’s advocacy in this regard went too far when she opposed the Shell lease out of concern that the Obama administration — her former employer — had authorized exploratory, offshore Arctic drilling. Gregoire defended her stance, saying the Shell situation was exceptional. But the Port must remain a neutral platform and not a means to protest federal policy.\nGregoire pledged to seek more transparency and accountability from Port staff. In retrospect, the Port shouldn’t have agreed to keep the Shell lease details secret for so long, she said.\nEvidence that she and other commissioners have taken this to heart has come this year during the flap over the international facility at Sea-Tac. After Alaska Airlines and others protested that the proposal would overly tax domestic flights and its design would favor Delta Air Lines, the Port paused the project to consider feedback and how to proceed.\nGregoire said further improvement in process and accountability should come now that the Port has hired a chief of staff to independently support commissioners.\nChallengers are perennial candidate Goodspaceguy and John Naubert, a self-described communist who said he would not support the Port’s role as an engine of the capitalist system. Gregoire is the best candidate.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
