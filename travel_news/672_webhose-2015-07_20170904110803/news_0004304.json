Delta’s A350 Entry Into Service teams, made up of subject matter experts from each operational division, will spend several hours with the jet as well to ensure its entry into service is a smooth one.\nThe decision to purchase 50 Airbus widebody jets came after a months-long review of proposals from Boeing and Airbus by a cross-divisional Delta team, and follows a careful consideration of the airline’s overall fleet needs.\nDelta fleet acquisition strategy is built on evaluating an airplane’s total cost of ownership – the sum total of long-term operating and maintenance costs, purchase price and other factors — and is key to Delta’s continued financial success.\nThe fuel-efficient Airbus A350-900 will operate primarily on long-haul trans-Pacific routes and are an important component of Delta’s restructuring to optimize its Asia-Pacific network.\nDelta will take delivery of the A350-900 starting in the second quarter of 2017 through 2020.\nSource: Delta Air Lines.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Lufthansa Group increases result in core business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:05:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
