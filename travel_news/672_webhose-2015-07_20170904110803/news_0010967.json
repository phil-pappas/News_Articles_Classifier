The Live Like a Local hub is a customised microsite hosted on TripAdvisor that takes travellers off the beaten path with things to see and do, eat and drink in Singapore.\nIn curating the Live Like a Local hub, TripAdvisor has for the first time worked with a National Tourism Organisation, and incorporated user reviews together with recommendations from TripAdvisor local experts. The sections on popular Singapore neighbourhoods such as Tiong Bahru and Joo Chiat have specially curated content for travellers to find out more about these bustling areas and experience them like a local.\n“With over 225 million reviews and opinions covering 4.9 million accommodations, restaurants and attractions around the world, TripAdvisor is well positioned to provide useful travel advice to help travellers research, plan and book their travel,” said Cindy Tan, Vice President APAC at TripAdvisor. “Singapore is one of Asia’s top Travellers’ Choice Destinations in 2015 and we are thrilled to be working with STB and MEC to help travellers uncover Singapore’s local, hidden gems.”\nFrom quirky Singapore souvenirs and local independent brands to the swimming pool in Changi Airport, the Live like a Local hub’s inspirational and engaging stories and content will thus help lesser known yet interesting establishments and activities in Singapore to be discovered. TripAdvisor will also hold targeted masterclasses for the establishments featured on Live Like a Local, aimed at helping these businesses harness the benefits of online reviews.\n“The Live Like a Local hub showcases our city through the eyes of locals and travellers. Their unique insights and ideas will empower fellow travellers to personalise their itineraries and inspire new visitors to experience a more authentic side of Singapore,” said Ms Lim Shoo Ling, Deputy Director, Strategic Marketing and Brand, Singapore Tourism Board.\nConnie Chan, Managing Director, MEC Global Solutions said, “We were looking to find a way to expand Singapore Tourism Board’s relationship with TripAdvisor beyond regular content sharing. The Live like a Local idea did just that, turning the relationship from a brand page into a genuine activation hub, using authentic consumer voices to drive engagement and interaction, going well beyond simple media placements to bring content marketing to life across paid, earned and owned media. It is great to work with partners like Singapore Tourism Board and TripAdvisor who value such innovation as much as we do”.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Former Director of Mandarin World Holidays Convicted of Operating Without a Valid Travel Agent Licence Revocation of Travel Agent Licence: Journey of Dreams Pte Ltd Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced $15-million fund to develop tourism associations New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:10:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
