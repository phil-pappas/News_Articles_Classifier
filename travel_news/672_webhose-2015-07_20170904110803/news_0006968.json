It said that only about 3 per cent of the accommodations on the 200-kilometre (125-mile) route were damaged by the April 25 earthquake.\nThe quake, coupled with another in May, killed 8,898 people.\nNepal's government, hoping that visitors will return in September when tourist season begins, welcomed the assessment.\nHowever, mountaineering and trekking operators said that the study was done in haste, covering a huge area and without consulting anyone in the business.\n\"The assessment should have been more detailed taking much longer time, because it covers such important safety issue,\" said Keshav Pandey of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal.\nPandey said the study should have co-ordinated with the trekking operators who have good knowledge and experience of the area.\nThe trail around Mount Annapurna gets about 115,000 foreign trekkers —some 60 per cent of all hikers who travel to Nepal every year. A favourable safety report makes it easier for visitors to get travel insurance — a major concern for people planning their trip to Nepal.\nThe Miyamoto team is also assessing routes on the foothills of Mount Everest, and expects to complete work in two weeks.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:23:51.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
