He was arrested and taken to the police station to take a urine test,” said Daniel Nilsson, a police spokesman for the central Uppsala region.\n“The incident lasted several minutes. Once the test was carried out he left,” Nilsson added of the brief arrest which took place after the celebrity rapper gave a concert in the area on Saturday night.\nSnoop Dogg reacted by vowing that he would not return to Sweden.\n“2 all my Sweden fans U can blame YA police dept for never seeing me again in your beautiful country,” the rapper wrote in a tweet.\nThe test results were not immediately available.\nIt is far from the 43-year-old music star’s first brush with the law.\nSnoop Dogg’s song lyrics often display his fondness for marijuana and he has previously had run-ins with police elsewhere over the drug.\nIt’s hard being Snoop D.O.G.G.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DI3yXg-sX5c?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-27T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:16:03.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
