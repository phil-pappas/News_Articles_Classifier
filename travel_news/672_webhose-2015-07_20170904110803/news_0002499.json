Available to all meeting and convention attendees, exhibitors, meeting planners and event staff, the updated pass offers the opportunity to save at more than 60 restaurants and approximately 50 tours, attractions, retailers and cultural organisations throughout New York City’s five boroughs – 40 more than had previously participated between January and June of this year. \n‘With unrivalled hotels and venues in addition to world-class dining, attractions, shopping and culture, New York City is an ideal place to do business,’ said Fred Dixon, NYC & Company president and CEO. ‘The Delegate Discount Pass allows business travellers to experience more of the City during their visit at an affordable price, and the expansion of the program is a proof point of its continued success.’ More than 425,000 delegates from approximately 50 conventions and trade shows have received the pass and have the opportunity to take advantage of its savings during the rest of the year. In 2014 New York City welcomed an estimated 6.1 million meeting and convention delegates, up from 5.9 million delegates who spent approximately $5 billion in the five boroughs in 2013. An important contributor to New York City’s tourism industry, MICE visitation from around the globe continues to increase each year. The Delegate Discount Pass is valid until 31st December 2015. To redeem offers, visitors must show a printed or mobile version of the Delegate Discount Pass, provided by NYC & Company’s Destination Services team, to convention, trade show and corporate meeting planners.
