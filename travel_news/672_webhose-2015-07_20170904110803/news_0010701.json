The cost of aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) was $62.1 billion in 2014 and is expected to grow to $90 billion by 2024*. The WMS will enable aviation stakeholders to share experience and best practices on managing this critical function with maximum efficiency.\n“Airlines place safety as the highest priority and work hard to maximize the operational reliability of their aircraft. To accomplish this while reducing the ever-increasing cost of MRO remains a challenge. The World Maintenance Symposium presents a unique opportunity for all stakeholders to share lessons learned and cross-sector expertise that reflect global standards and best practices,” said Rob Eagles, IATA’s interim Senior Vice President, Safety and Flight Operations.\nThe WMS program sessions will address the complexities of aircraft maintenance, covering topics such as:\nOpportunities of Wi-Fi versus in-seat inflight entertainment (IFE) in aircraft cabins Aircraft dispatch reliability and human factors Financial and reputational impact from delays Virtual maintenance training (VMT) for MRO\nIn conjunction with the WMS, the 11th edition of the Maintenance Cost Conference (MCC) will take place, offering parallel sessions on:\n3-D printing techniques and how they are reducing costs across MRO areas Improving the turn-around time for components that need outsourcing Implementing paperless maintenance records to improve efficiencies and minimize costly human error\nMore than 300 delegates from airlines, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), maintenance and repair organizations, solution providers, and other stakeholders across the global value chain are expected to attend the event.\n*Source: Jonathan M.
