Mauney (ITAL) knows (END ITAL) he can.\nThe Statesville, N.C., cowboy has already ridden the unrideable.\nSo he can approach every bull like a potential payday, like Tuesday when he spurred out a round-winning 89.5 on Radioactive to kick off Pool B action at the Calgary Stampede.\nMauney will forever be known as the man who finally tamed Bushwacker, the famous PBR bull that has his own popular line of t-shirts, belt buckles and plush toys.\n“I got on him 13 times,” said Mauney, who kept selecting Bushwacker at event after event.\nAnd he rode him ...\n“Once,” Mauney said with a big smile. “But the only thing I’m looking at is the checkmark on my list.”\nIt’s the only thing that matters.\nMauney tried Bushwacker nine times before he made the whistle — by a hair — in Tulsa, Okla., two years ago.\n“If I had to ride him 8.2 seconds, I’d have been out of luck,” Mauney said. “When that whistle blew, I hit the ground hard.”\nESPN filmed a short documentary (E:60 Bushwacker) on the rivalry that eventually paid off with a stratospheric 95.25 score.\nOwner Julio Moreno retired Bushwacker, who holds the PBR record of 42 consecutive buckoffs prior to Mauney’s triumph, at the end of last season.\nMauney, a two-time Stampede champion, wasn’t about to shed a tear when he heard the 1,750-lb., chocolate brown beast was heading to the pasture.\n“Everybody said ‘aw, it’ll be sad to see him leave,’ ” Mauney said. “I wasn’t really sad about it.\n“I rode him. I didn’t have to prove myself anymore.\n“I didn’t want to have to get on him no more.”\nOne of the keys to Bushwacker’s success was his unpredictability. He never had the same trip twice.\nSo Mauney had to go after each ride without a playbook.\nJust like Tuesday when he bested Radioactive for $5,500.\n“I knew nothing about him,” Mauney said. “Never seen the bull before and didn’t have a clue about him.\n“I just tried to do what I always do with them and that’s ride ’em jump for jump.\n“Luckily enough, he bucked hard enough that I won the round.”\nJust because he bested the best, the 28-year-old knows any bull can put him in the dirt.\nAnd Tuesday’s ride was no walk in the park.\n“He tested me,” the 2009 and ’13 champ said. “He kinda had some rolls in there and was leaping up in the air.\n“It was a little wild and western.\n“But I get along with those bulls. I like them when they’re wild and don’t really have a set pattern.”\nGuilherme Marchi (Ferris, Tex.) was second with an 87 to pocket $4,500.\nWesley Silcox (Santaquin, Utah) and Sage Kimzey (Strong City, Okla.) split third/fourth at 85.5 ($3,000).\nWatch E:60 Bushwacker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9hvCMZpk_U\n- Scott Fisher\nSteer-wrestling\nTrevor Knowles keeps bringing hardware back home from the Calgary Stampede.\nTrouble is, his biggest fans are running out storage space.\n“They’re at my folks’ house,” Knowles said. “My dad said he’s going to melt them down and build a cannon.”\nHang tight, Jeff ... there’s more metal on the way.\nThe Calgary Stampede’s reigning steer-wrestling champion, Knowles picked up right where he left off in opening go-round of Pool B at the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\nThe 34-year-old bulldogger from Mount Vernon, Ore., finished his dirty work Tuesday in 3.9 seconds, stuffing $5,500 in day-money into his Wranglers and picking up yet another championship bronze.\nAnd how was he planning to celebrate?\nBy going to bed early.\nHonest.\n“It’s always great to come here,” Knowles said. “For one, after the Fourth of July run, a guy needs to sit in one spot and catch up on some rest for a while. And two, the money is good and it’s a great rodeo. I’m just really happy to be here. I’m really looking forward to sleeping in a bed.\n“We’ve been everywhere,” he continued. “I was in Prescott, Arizona, on Sunday and then flew (Monday) to Pasco, Washington, and got these horses and drove all night to get here. So it’s been pickup seats and airplane seats, but we’re here.”\nHere ... and $5,500 richer.\n“Yeah, that don’t hurt anything,” Knowles said with a grin. “When you do it for a living, it sure doesn’t hurt to win something.”\nYou couldn’t blame Knowles’ bulldogging buddies for feeling like he’s already won more than his fair share in Calgary.\nHe claimed his first Stampede crown in 2009, then won another in ‘12 and completed the hat-trick last summer.\n“You just have confidence, and you’re comfortable,” Knowles said. “On Sunday, when you’re running (for $100,000), there’s dang sure some butterflies, but I think it helps to be here quite a few times and kind of eliminate some of it.”\nHe feels comfortable, too, on his trusty horse Earl, the same ride that helped him to the jackpot on Showdown Sunday last year.\n“He’s a good horse,” Knowles said. “He’s just pretty easy to ride and he doesn’t cost you money. He gives you chances, so this should be a good week. If he does his job, I just need to do mine.”\n- Wes Gilbertson\nBarrel-racing\nLisa Lockhart got exactly what she needed from Louie on Tuesday.\nThe Oelrichs, S.D. cowgirl and her 11-year-old Buckskin, Louie, powered around the three-barrel course in a time of 17.32 to win the barrel-racing event in Pool B action at the Calgary Stampede.\n“I tried to ease up the alley and it’s nice to have a horse you can do that on,” Lockhart said about the approach before blast off.\n“He’s been very good but I worried about it today. (Horses) get very insecure walking up there by themselves and I don’t blame them. I’m insecure. He walked in there and it allowed me to set up my first barrel and that was my goal.”\nWith the victory, Lockhart stuffs $5,500 in her pockets going into Day 2 action. Callie duPerier of Boerne, Texas finished up second with a time of 17.57. The Texas racer snagged $4,500 for her efforts. Tara Muldoon, of Hinton, finished third in a time of 17.62. The Alberta gal took home $3,500 for a time of 17.62.\nLockhart has won three Canadian Championships and over a million dollars in her racing career, so it’s fair to say the South Dakota success story knows what she’s doing in the saddle.\nHer plan was to let the horse do its thing and leave the result to fate.\nAs it turned out less is more.\n“I tried not to override him and push him too hard,” Lockhart said. “When you do that you don’t know if you’re going to be an 18.30 (seconds) or a 17.30. I’m very surprised at my time. I know he felt great but I didn’t hustle him like I normally would. You just don’t know.”\n- Gordon Anderson\nSaddle-bronc\nHe made the eight-second saddle-bronc ride look easy.\nThe painful part was watching Taos Muncy — fresh off an 87.5-point spin aboard Simply Marvellous — hobble back across the infield at Stampede Park on a bad knee.\n“A little sore, but that’s just a part of it,” said Muncy, a two-time world champion from Corona, N.M. “It’s a just a little injury. No big deal. It’s just sore when I ride ... After I get off, 10 or 15 seconds, and it’s gone.”\nIf you follow the rodeo circuit, you already know that “a little injury” is oftentimes much more serious than any of the cowboys — or cowgirls — will let on.\nMuncy, though, isn’t getting much sympathy from his saddle-bronc buddies.\n“They’ve been calling me a sissy,” he said with a laugh. “But I won’t whine about it.”\nMuncy wasn’t complaining about anything Tuesday.\nHe woke up to a text message with good news — he’d scored a date with Calgary Stampede’s Simply Marvellous in the opening go-round of Pool B saddle-bronc action at the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\nHe took advantage of it, too, claiming top spot and the $5,500 that goes with it.\n“When I woke up and I seen that, I was like, ‘Heck yeah, that’ll work,’ ” Muncy said. “I was really happy to have that horse. I got on him at the NFR last year and won some money on him there, so I owe him a sack of grain, I guess. He’s treated me good.”\n- Wes Gilbertson\nBareback\nIt didn’t take very long for Caleb Bennett to announce his arrival with authority.\nThe 2013 Calgary Stampede Bareback champ dropped an 87.5 on Knight Rocket to win the opening go round of Pool B at the Calgary Stampede on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe roster for Pool B reads like the glitterati of the bareback world. Of the 10 riders in the event, seven of them were 2014 National Finals Rodeo contestants.\nAnd for the Morgan, Utah resident, who was first out of the chute, the difficult competition stokes the proverbial fire in the belly.\n“(The lineup) is stacked,” Bennett said. “You pretty much got a mini round of the NFR here. I get more nervous and I want to win more because of who I’m up against. They’re tough and they’re not going to let up. They want to win as much as I do.”\nWith the win, Bennett pockets $5,500 for his troubles. Tim O’Connell, from Zwingle, Idaho, came second with an 87 and grabbed $4,500 while Orin Larsen, ofInglis, Man., was third with an 85 and earned a cool $3,500.\nBut Bennett has beaten the best of the best where it counts and he used his winnings from Calgary to make a number of smart decisions. Keep in mind, he was 23-years-old when he hit the cowboy lottery on Showdown Sunday two years ago.\n“I used some of those winnings for a down payment on a place,” Bennett said.“That’s where most of the money went then investing a little bit here and there.”\nWinning a $100,000 a couple of years ago really put him in a good position to manage his affairs properly and effectively.\n“I was very fortunate and blessed to come by that (win) at such a young age,” Bennett said. “It’s a huge help when you do what I do for a living. Honestly, it opened a lot of doors for me ... I couldn’t ask for more.”\nThe Utah cowpoke said there is a little remorse when he sees the guys spending some of their cash on trinkets, so to speak. For the moment, he’s not interested in ‘keeping up with Jones’.\n“I get disappointed sometimes that I don’t have a lot of toys like boats and motorcycles, like all the other guys do, but give it a few years and I might have them ... I’m trying to go the business route first.”\nBut the 25-year-old also does a good job of mixing business with pleasure. If you can’t have fun getting tossed ragged by bucking broncs, when can you have fun?\n“It’s a different line of work and if you can’t have fun and enjoy what you’re doing then you shouldn’t be out here,” Bennett said.\nHe even thought Knight Rocket was a blast on a sunny afternoon.\n“Never been on him, but I’ve seen him a bunch,” Bennett said. “What better a time to strap to that horse for the first time than in Calgary? It was awesome. Fun ride, fun horse.”\n- Gordon Anderson\n Tie-down roping\nFred Whitfield is getting near his golden years but it sure was a total golden performance on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe 48-year-old cowboy won the tie-down roping event in 7.1 seconds to open Pool B action at the Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\nThe pleasant and smiling cowboy from Hockley, Texas didn’t get the nod to drive north until May.\n“I was on pins and needles waiting on the call,” Whitfield said . “(When) I got the call, I started preparing myself for Calgary. The starts are quick, the calves are good and the competition is great.”\nConsidering Whitfield isn’t roping calves on a regular basis he had some work to do to get to the level he works with. When the Calgary Stampede asks you out on a date, you say sure, why not?\n“I haven’t been doing a lot (of rodeo),” Whitfield admitted. “I picked nine rodeos over the course of working my way towards Calgary. I roped quite a bit before I left home. I went to Nebraska and won a bit of money.”\nEven an eight-time world champion runs out of racetrack at some point, but he’s not sure when exactly that will be. This is his 26th Calgary Stampede.\n“As long as they invite me I’ll come back,” Whitfield said after pocketing $5,500 in day money. “But there’s going to come a day when I’m not going to rope a calf at seven (seconds), so I try to make the most of it.”\nBut until that point this is where he wants to be every July.\n“I feel more welcome here than any other place in the world,” Whitfield said.\n- Gordon Anderson", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9hvCMZpk_U"], "published": "2015-07-08T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T21:44:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
