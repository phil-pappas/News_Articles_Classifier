The waiver applies to British nationals for stays of up to 15 days and applies until June 30 next year. \nAsia specialist Insider Journeys has cut £100 off small group tours in Indochina that include Vietnam for bookings made by July 31. \n“The vast majority of our clients fit into that 15-day validity,” said Lesley Wright, the operator’s general manager, commercial. “It would be lovely if it was 30-day, but we will see the greater impact from travellers looking for a two-week journey.” \nWright said securing visas for late sales had been a problem, with letters of authorisation needed for visa on arrival. “I’ve waited up to an hour, it’s not a great way to start your holiday,” she said. \nShe added: “This also opens the door to a three or four-day stopover on the way to Australia and makes Vietnam more attractive as a beach destination.” \nThe suspension of the visa fee will be followed by the upgrading of Vietnam Airlines’ flights from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi to a new Boeing 787-9 this summer. \n“This will also really put Vietnam up there,” Wright said. \nJames Mundy, InsideAsia Tours’ PR and marketing manager, said removing the visa would have an impact: “Although it was not a particularly troublesome or costly process in the first place, it will remove mental barriers to travelling to Vietnam and allow people to travel trouble-free to Vietnam.” \nMundy added that exemption meant all of InsideAsia’s tours could now be visited without having to go through lengthy visa processes before travel. \n“Vietnam and Japan are visa-free on arrival, Cambodia and Laos are simple and cheap on arrival into the country and Burma can be arranged with a straightforward online e-visa.” \nLaurence Hicks, managing director at Wendy Wu Tours, added: “This is a move towards recognition that UK and EU visitors are undeniably valuable to Vietnam’s tourism economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:18:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
