Shocking photographs have emerged of the dolphins swimming around in the chlorinated pool, which measures just 10m by 20 and reports claim the dolphins are going blind from exposure to the chemical. The Wake Bali dolphins are trapped in a tiny chlorinated pool (Change.org) The images show tourists hugging and kissing the dolphins as part of the Wake Bali Dolphins attraction, which offers holidaymakers the chance to \"make your holiday more fun and memorable to have a swimming with dolphins\". But not everyone is thrilled by the offer. Sydney surfer Craig Brokensha came across the shocking situation while on holiday in Bali and has started a Change.org petition to have the operation shut down, Daily Mail Australia reports. Mr Brokensha said the dolphins were made to perform for onlookers, but after the show they appeared \"still and lifeless\" in the pool. The Daily Mail reported that the dolphins appeared to be going blind from exposure to chlorine.
