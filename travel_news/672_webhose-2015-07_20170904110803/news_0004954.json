This year, a record number of students have applied early for finance. But if you’re not quite as organised, there's still time to get your application in. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android You can update your course or university details later but it’s best to get the application in as early as possible as it can take six weeks to process an application, if we’ve received all the correct evidence. Student finance is essential for most people attending university or college, to assist with everyday living costs. Many young people will be moving into rented accommodation and having to deal with their own finances for the first time and some students have their own families to support alongside their studies. Where you apply for student finance depends on where you are planning to study. The Student Loans Company processes all applications for students in England and has also taking over the processing of applications for new students in Wales. Students in Scotland apply to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) and Northern Ireland students should apply to the Education and Library Board (ELB). Students need to reapply for their student finance for each year of funding. Student finance – what’s available? Universities and colleges are able to charge different fees for their different courses, up to a maximum amount of £9,000 per year, which is set by the Government. Tuition fee loans are available to cover the costs of university fees and these are paid directly to the university or college. Maintenance loans are paid directly to the student to help with living costs while you’re studying; such as food, accommodation and travel. For example, if you’re an English student living away from home in London you could get a maintenance loan of up to £8,009. In Wales, the maximum amount of tuition fee loan available is £3,810. However, Welsh students can apply for a Fee Grant of up to £5,190 to cover the difference between the loan and the fee charged. You can choose to just take the Fee Grant, but will then have to cover the difference yourself. Tuition fee and maintenance loans are available to most students. Maintenance grants, which are based on your household income and do not have to be repaid, may also be available. Part-time students can also apply for student support. Students with special circumstances If you have dependants or if you have a disability, you may qualify for extra help on top of your main student finance package, depending on your circumstances. What do you need to apply? If you’re applying for finance you should have the following information to hand to ensure your application is processed as quickly as possible: • UK Passport number • Bank Account details • National insurance number, which can be found on your national insurance card or letter, a payslip or tax document such as a P45 or P60 • The university or college course details – you should choose the course you’re most likely to start as it’s easy to update your details online at a later date There is a section for parents or partner to complete so it may also be helpful for them to have their National Insurance number to hand, if you’re applying for student finance based on the household income. Should any evidence be requested, send it straight away. How much you pay back You must pay back Tuition Fee Loans and Maintenance Loans. You pay interest on these. You don’t have to pay back other student finance, eg grants and bursaries. Your repayments are linked to your income and you only make repayments when your income is over £21,000 a year. Visit studentloanrepayment.co.uk for more information on repayment for full and part-time students.
