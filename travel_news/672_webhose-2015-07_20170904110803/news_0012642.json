(Kyodo photo) - + Japan, China, S. Korea target 30m visitors FUKUOKA â€” Many tourists visited the \"Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution\" on the first Saturday after the sites were added to the Unesco World Cultural Heritage list. \nLocal authorities and business communities hosting the 23 sites in the eight prefectures are preparing for an increased number of visitors, including nurturing more tour guides and improving access. \nNagasaki City, which has several sites including the Hashima Coal Mine, known as \"Battleship Island\" because of its shape, set up an information center on the sites in front of JR Nagasaki Station in April. \nThree women serve at the information centre where they provide information not only in Japanese but English and Korean. \n\"I've checked information on the Internet. But it was good we were able to hear information directly from the staff,\" 55-year-old Tomohisa Suzuki, a government employee from Shizuoka Prefecture, said after stopping at the center Saturday. \nArao, Kumamoto prefecture, has the Manda Pit of the Miike Coal Mine. Twelve men and women in their 30s to 70s are attending the Arao city government's tour guide lessons and plan to begin operation as guides from September. \nA visitor to the pit, Shomi Yamamoto, a 27-year-old company employee from Kumamoto prefecture, said, \"I feel the history. I hope it will help promote local tourism.\" \nHagi, Yamaguchi prefecture, is home to five sites including the Hagi reverberatory furnace. The city government has printed a booklet to show recommended routes to tour them. \nThe ruins of the Hashino Blast Furnace in Kamaishi, Iwate prefecture, are relatively far from train stations. The Kamaishi city government has increased parking spaces and launched guided bus tours linking JR Kamaishi Station and the site. \nThe remains of the Mietsu naval shipyard and training centre from the Edo Period in Saga City are currently buried under the ground and visitors cannot see them. The Saga prefectural and city governments installed binocular-type devices at the site. \nVisitors can see the re-enacted images of steamboats, artillery training and other visions to show what it was like by peering through the binoculars. \nShoji Fujimoto, a 62-year-old company employee from Fukuoka, said while seeing the images, \"I feel like as if I were in the late Edo Period.\" \nKagoshima City has three sites apart from each other. A non-profit organisation hosted a lecture in June telling taxi drivers how to tour the sites effectively. \nThere are restrictions in seeing the Yawata Steel Works in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka prefecture, because the formerly state-run facility now belongs to Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp and is still operating. \nNippon Steel allowed taking photos of the exterior of the former head office, built in 1899, from Monday. \nKazuya Yoshimoto, a 58-year-old self-employed man from Fukuoka prefecture, said, \"I'm glad that now I can take photos of it.\" \nThe city of Izunokuni, Shizuoka prefecture, will run a free shuttle bus linking a railway station and the Nirayama reverberatory furnace every day from July 25 to Aug 31. \nThe \"Sites of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution: Iron and Steel, Shipbuilding and Coal Mining\" were added to the list Wednesday as the Unesco World Heritage Committee decided to do so after South Korea withdrew its opposition on condition Japan publicly acknowledge that Koreans had been coerced to work at some of the sites during World War II.
