Popular holiday islands of Bali and Lombok airports are most badly struck as almost 250 flights were cancelled.\nThe obscure visibility at Bali’s Denpasar airport is a result of the erupting Mount Raung in East Java for nearly a week, spewing clouds of ash. The closures came during peak Ramadan holiday season in Bali, Indonesia which attracts millions of foreign tourists every year to its serene beaches.\nAuthorities raised the alert status of Mount Raung, a 3,300-metre (10,800-foot) volcano, late last month to the second highest level after it began to spew lava and ash high into the air. It was producing flames and a thundering sound. But authorities said that no evacuations were necessary as those living in the area were already a safe distance away.\nApart from the Denpasar Airport in Bali, the four other affected airports are the International Airport in Lombok, Selaparang Airport also in Lombok, Blimbingsari Airport in Banyuwangi, East Java and Notohadinegoro Airport in Jember, East Java.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
