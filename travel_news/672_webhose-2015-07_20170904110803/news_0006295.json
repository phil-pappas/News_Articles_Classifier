Groups successfully reaching the summit in recent weeks have found unusually calm winds and relatively warm temperatures. \nGuides place ladders over crevasses so climbers can cross, but as the giant cracks get too wide even for ladders, new climbing routes have to be sought out, Ellis said. \nThe park's climbing rangers maintain a blog in which they report up-to-date conditions and route information. \nJanow said the conditions are not uncommon for the 14,411-foot volcano — he just expects them a little later in the year. \nThe summer climbing season — busiest from Memorial Day to Labor Day — isn't going to end early, Ellis said. But the guide services, which maintain the routes to ascend the peak, will likely have to start finding some creative new routes if the warm temperatures continue, he added. \nA recent heat wave only added to a winter that saw little snow pile up below 8,000 feet in the Cascades, Ellis added. The overall effect was a different upper mountain this year. \n\"Things just look different than they have in the past,\" Ellis said. \nIce caves still show up in places on the mountain, formed when water flows under a glacier or other ice formation, but explorers should be aware of the dangers, said climbing ranger Forrest Madsen. That danger became obvious with the partial collapse of an ice cave in Snohomish County earlier this week. \n\"Whether you're above them or in them, it's a fairly dangerous spot to be caught,\" Madsen said. \nThings have been looking different for the last 40 years, at least, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report that found Mount Rainier glaciers had lost 14 percent of their volume from 1970 to 2008. \nBut while global warming is fingered for shrinking glaciers, it may not be behind the most recent hot weather, according to University of Washington atmospheric science professor Cliff Mass. \nMass said the warmer weather over roughly the last year — and especially the last few weeks — is so out of the ordinary that it can only be attributed to natural variations in weather. \n\"If you have a very, very extreme situation, global warming can't be the cause of most of it,\" Mass said. \"Global warming isn't large enough to be the cause of it.\" Information from: Seattle Post-Intelligencer, http://www.seattlepi.com/ Recommended Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T03:45:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
