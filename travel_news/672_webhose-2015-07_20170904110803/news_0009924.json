Whether you're visiting the Heart of Dixie's Gulf Shores or Orange Beach or venturing into Florida for a spot along 30-A, one thing's for sure: vacation dining is at its best along the Gulf Coast. \nThe fresh seafood options and unbeatable views make dining on the coast yet another reason (beside the sand and sun) to roadtrip South. Check out our beach dining guide for places to grab a quick bite or enjoy fancy night out. Don't forget to tell us about your favorite beach spots in the comments below. \n30-A Guide \nBreakfast: The Donut Hole \nWith locations in Destin and Santa Rosa, Fla., this cafe and bakery has become a vacation-must for many beach-goers. Outside of their expansive donut selection including red velvet, key lime pie and chocolate peanut butter filled, all of which are a must, The Donut Hole doubles as a full-service diner that serves breakfast from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. If you plan to sit down for breakfast during a peak season, make sure to get there early because the line for a table often wraps around the building. Once you're seated, order the Gulf Coast Crabmeat Benedict or \"Diet Plate\" -- buttermilk biscuits topped with sausage patties, fried eggs, and cheese then smothered in cream gravy. You won't be sorry. Destin (850) 837-8824. Santa Rosa Beach (850) 267-3239. \nLunch: Seaside \nTake an afternoon trip to Seaside to wander around their specialty shops, stands and boutiques while grabbing a bite to eat. Try a couple of their options served out of airstream trailers like the Southeast Asian-inspired tacos and sandwiches at Song's or jazzed up grilled cheeses at The Melt Down. For something truly special, pick up a to-go salad or sandwich with a craft beer or fresh fruit juice blend at Modica Market. Friday is their famous grouper po' boy, if you're into that sort of thing. seasidefl.com/shop-dine/restaurants \nDinner: McGuire's Irish Pub \nAll the kitsch of your favorite diner with as many options as a Cheesecake Factory and the finesse of a more expensive restaurant, the atmosphere and quality of food at McGuire's does not disappoint. Order one of their many cuts of steak or 25 burger options, and take advantage of their 18 cent Irish bean soup. Yes, it's really only 18 cents. It's also imperative to try a signature Irish Wake served in a take-home commemorative Mason jar. Warning: They're pretty strong so McGuire's will cut you off at three. mcguiresirishpub.com \nDessert: Shake's \nFinish up your day of great dining by picking up some frozen custard at Shake's. Order at the pick-up window and enjoy your treat at one of their outside tables or in your car for the true drive-in experience. They've got floats, concretes, cones, sundaes and, of course, shakes with toppings like cake batter and key lime pie bits to satisfy any sweet tooth. shakesdestin.com \nGulf Shores/Orange Beach Guide \nBreakfast: Tacky Jacks \nA popular dinner spot overlooking the water, the Tacky Jacks outdoor patio is the perfect spot to enjoy the early morning breeze with a couple of their giant \"wheelhouse\" pancakes or their sunrise egg platter served Southern with grits and your choice of meat. For those who want the great views and waterfront atmosphere at Tacky Jacks without the long waits for a table at dinner, breakfast is the perfect time to stop by for a meal. tackyjacks.com \nLunch: Sea-n-Suds or The Gulf \nIf you don't feel like stepping off the beach to grab a bite for lunch, Sea-n-Suds in Gulf Shores is a great option for a quick lunch. Advertised as the only beach front dining on the Alabama Gulf Coast, Sea-n-Suds is a favorite for its fried shrimp sandwiches and special gumbo. For a slightly more upscale option, The Gulf in Orange Beach is possibly the hippest new restaurant on the beach. Lounge on a big white couch on their multi-level outdoor patio while enjoying any of their daily specials like red snapper ceviche or grilled swordfish sandwiches. sea-n-suds.com , thegulf.com \nDinner: Louisiana Lagniappe \nWith a name that means a little something extra, Louisiana Lagniappe is the spot for when you want just that - beach dining with a little something extra. Visit either of their restaurants in Orange Beach or Destin, both located on the water, for fresh seafood served with a Creole flair in an upscale, white tablecloth outdoor dining setting. Try their corn and crab bisque and hushpuppies for an appetizer, followed by a main course of grouper meuniere or Louisianne, and finish your meal with a palette-cleansing slice of key lime pie. louisianalagniappe.com \nDessert: Hope's Cheesecake \nFor some of the best cheesecake outside the Big Apple, head to Hope's Cheesecake in Gulf Shores. The shop offers a large variety of cheesecakes seven days a week. Flavors range from apple crisp to Bailey's to traditional strawberry and every candy imaginable. The best part is you can take a slice, or actually 12 slices, of your vacation home by ordering one of their 10-inch cheesecakes online. hopescheesecake.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:01:42.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
