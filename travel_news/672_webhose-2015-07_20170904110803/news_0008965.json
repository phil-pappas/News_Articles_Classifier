We thank the vice president for his candor, and we congratulate Gov. Cuomo for having the vision and courage to press ahead with this ambitious plan. Our hope is that this marks the beginning of a national conversation on the interconnectedness of America's economy with its airport infrastructure.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:07:58.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
