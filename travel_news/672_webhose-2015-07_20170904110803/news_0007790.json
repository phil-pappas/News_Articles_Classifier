So naturally, when Universal Orlando opened the Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Hogsmeade , I knew I had to go. \nPhoto by Michelle Rae Uy \nMany years later, there I am in Orlando, theme park capital of the world, at one of its busiest attractions with thousand others, to make my half-buried, adolescent dream happen. I'm not usually a big fan of theme parks, not like some of my friends. The big, aggressive crowds and the screaming kids only aggravate my anxiety. But this time, I am giddy as a schoolgirl. \nFinally, I walk past the 7,456-brick wall into Diagon Alley , just as intricate as its literary counterpart and open an hour early to onsite hotel guests. And just like how I consumed the books, I consume it too. \nI rush past the magic shops along the cobbled streets that lead to Gringotts and its fire-breathing Ukranian Ironbelly, and I get on Escape from Gringotts . Afterwards, I take the Hogwarts Express from Platform 9 Â¾ to Hogsmeade sorta like Harry and the gang, and then ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (my favorite, for some reason). \nPhoto by Michelle Rae Uy \nWhen I finally get all three popular rides that render those shiny express passes useless out of the way, I slow down and actually take the rest of it in. I buy a wand at Ollivanders (Hermione's, of course) and cast cool spells. I visit Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes and carefully venture into Knockturn Alley to check out Dark Arts objects at Borgin and Burkes. And then grab a pint or two of that legendary Butterbeer (get it frozen) at Three Broomsticks , exactly like Harry and the gang. \nPhoto by Michelle Rae Uy \nI do these and more; and it's as I imagined when I first read the books. Ok, maybe in some ways, just a little better. \nAnd as the sun sets in good ol' Orlando, possibly the land where dreams come true, and my tired feet are screaming for respite and relief, I know that my old teenage wish, unambitious and juvenile as it may be, has just been realized. \nFollow Michelle Rae Uy on Twitter: www.twitter.com/blueskyhardrock More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T21:42:31.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
