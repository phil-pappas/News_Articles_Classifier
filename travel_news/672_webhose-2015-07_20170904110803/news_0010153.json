Further last-ditch negotiations could still avert the walk-out – there were talks until late last night and further meetings scheduled for today. \nA 48-hour strike by First Great Western staff is also expected to cause disruption from Wednesday evening until Saturday morning. The train company runs routes from London Paddington, and in South Wales, the Cotswolds and the West of England. To check if your train is affected, see the First Great Western website. Why are workers striking? \nIt’s all about a pay increase ahead of the launch of the 24-hour Night Tube in September . London Underground’s final offer, including a two per cent rise and a £2,000 bonus for drivers working on the all-night service, was rejected by representatives from four unions – RMT, Aslef, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and Unite. \nFirst Great Western staff are striking over plans to cut guards and buffet cars on the company’s new Hitachi Inter City Express trains. \nBus services will still be running Photo: GETTY When will it start? \nRMT, United and TSSA members are planning a 24-hour Tube strike from 18:30 on Wednesday evening (July 8); ASLEF members from 21:30. \nFirst Great Western staff will begin their 48-hour strike at 18:30 on Wednesday. How bad will disruption be? \nIf the Tube strike goes ahead, it will be very bad. Transport for London (TfL) warns that there will be no service whatsoever from “late afternoon” on July 8 and no service at all on July 9. This does NOT include London Overground or DLR services. For live updates check the TfL website . \nFirst Great Western services “will be significantly affected from Thursday, July 9 to the start of service on Saturday, July 11, with minor alterations to some services on Wednesday, July 8 from 18.00”, the company said. It warns that capacity will be reduced and that trains will be extremely busy. Passengers – particularly those planning to travel to Cardiff for The Ashes on Thursday or Friday – are advised to make alternative travel arrangements if possible. How will I get around? \nBuses and National Rail services will be running, but will no doubt be busy. TfL will be putting around 200 extra buses on the roads, however (note that diversions are in place in the City of London on Thursday, July 9, from 18:30 to 20:30, for the Standard Chartered Great City Race). For a scenic commute, see our guide to London’s best bus routes for sightseeing . \nLondoners might consider hiring a Boris bike – for a map of docking stations, see TfL's website . \nThere’s also the Thames Clipper riverboat service , whose stops include Putney, Wandsworth Riverside, Chelsea Harbour, London Eye, Embankment, Blackfriars, Bankside, London Bridge, Tower Hill, Canary Wharf and Greenwich. Extra river services will be in place between Central London and Canary Wharf and between Central London and Putney. \nDrivers can consult the AA website for routes and updates on disruption (don't forget to pay the Congestion Charge). \nThe Emirates Air Line will be running until midnight on Wednesday and Thursday (Oyster cards accepted). \nCoach companies such as National Express offer services that stop at London locations en route to Victoria Coach Station, such as Golders Green, Finchley Road, Baker Street and Marble Arch. For First Great Western customers, the firm is running extra services from London to the South West. For more information or to book visit www.nationalexpress.com or call 0871 781 8181. \nOr get up early and go on foot. The weather forecast for Thursday is warm and sunny, and there are plenty of beautiful walking routes in the capital. What about airports? \nHeathrow Express services, and rail services to Luton, Stansted and Gatwick, will be running as normal. \nWalking could prove a good option if the weather stays fair Photo: GETTY Will I be compensated? \nNo. Refunds are not available if a delay is beyond the control of TfL. Where can I find information? \nIt also suggested following @TfLTravelAlerts on Twitter or signing up to its email updates . \nFirst Great Western suggests checking for updates on Twitter - @fgw , calling 0345 7000 125 (7am – 10pm every day), or using \"Help Points\" at stations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:34:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
