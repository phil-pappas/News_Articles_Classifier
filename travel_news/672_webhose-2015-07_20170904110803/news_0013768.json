From 39 entrants, here are summaries of all the winning apps. · Travita (from London, UK) Grand Prize (£10,000) and Best Use of TripCase APIs (£1,500) Travita, is a corporate social responsibility online platform that connects business travellers that have spare baggage capacity with small charities in need around the world. Via their accounts, travellers are able to view items needed by charities in the destinations they’re travelling to. They can then opt to take these items with them on their travels, leaving them at a pick-up point for charities at the airport. The app also links with Air Miles, awarding travellers each time they participate. Travita was created by a team of four including three 19-year-old first year students from Queen Mary University, London. Sameen Islam, Kristina Semenyuk and Jaykumar Pradeep Rawal, and 35-year-old Katie Rushton, who has a background working for start-ups. The team took part in Destination Hack with their idea because “there is a real gap for a service like this in the market”. · Further (from Cyprus, GB, Italy, South Africa) Best Wearable Hack (£1,000) and Most Likely to Succeed – (£500 plus free Sabre API access, support, co-working space, marketing) Further is an interactive app that lets travellers gain local advice and insider secrets about a destination directly from those living there.

The app, which would work with the Oculus Rift, would be a platform through which retailers could offer a range of goods and services relevant to peoples’ travels, such as airline ancillaries, car rental, hotel excursions and more. This helps airlines and other travel companies drive additional revenue, whilst providing unique entertainment and experiences for passengers during flight. · Airmax (from Germany and UK) Best Twilio Implementation (Raspberry Pi 2 for each team member) Airmax enables consumers to swap, sell or gift flights to other users, aiming to solve the problem of non-flexibility on ticketing detail changes. The app links with TripCase to synchronise all bookings. Users can then easily select the desired flight they want to swap, sell or gift, and then looks for a match amongst other users. Users are then notified via an alert on their mobiles when a match becomes available. · Route 99 (from Spain) Joint winners of Customers Choice Challenge – multi-modal trips – (£1,000) Route 99 offers door-to-door travel booking, letting users of its online application create their routes on a map and then book all of their travel needs through one platform.

The idea for Waydesk was bron from its team’s day job – running a start-up, Waynaut, in Milan, Italy. Waynaut focuses on making door-to-door travel available to book through one simple click. It already covers journeys throughout the whole of Italy, but aims to expand this service internationally within the next few years. Its Destination Hack winning entry was built by combining Waynaut API with Sabre API. · OhSeat! (from UK) Best Twilio Implementation (Raspberry Pi 2 for each team member) and Best Use of SeatGuru API (£650) OhSeat! helps air passengers to find the best available seats for their flights in seconds. Either online or vie text message, a passenger can send the flight number and the app will show the best available seat plus provide further info on the seats, such as the proximity to the lavatories. Additionally, for passengers who already have seats, it allows them to send their seat numbers and the app will suggest options for switching to better seats. The application was built by Nick Tikhonov, Octavian Sima and Alex Ciminian, using Twilio and Sabre Seat Map API, alongside with FlightAware and SeatGuru. · Qurated (from London, UK) Most Innovative Use of GetYourGuide API – (£100 voucher for each member to use on any GetYourGuide products) Qurated enables users to book travel based on recommendations from friends and family.

The app was developed by Pavan Bandhu and Jagdeep Nagpal by linking APIs from Sabre with GetYourGuide APIs, and further incorporates HP Sentiment Analysis API to get up to date information on which cities and countries are safest. “This Hackathon was eye-opening as it clearly showed how much we still have left to accomplish in travel technology and how the API's from Sabre and its partners allows innovation, from even small teams of entrepreneurs, to become reality so much faster than ever before,” added judge, Karl Peterson, senior partner at TPG.
