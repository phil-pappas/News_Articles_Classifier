Scotland accounts for about 10 per cent of Greene King’s retail estate. \n“A material part of our business has been affected by a very sudden and fairly poorly trailed change in legislation,” said Mr Anand. \nThe company posted adjusted pre-tax profits of £168.5m for the year, down 0.8 per cent as a result of tenanted pub disposals. Excluding pubs acquired or sold during the period, pre-tax profits rose 6.9 per cent to £167m — in line with the consensus of analyst forecasts, according to Bloomberg — on the back of the growing retail estate and lower interest costs. \nPaul Hickman, analyst at Edison Investment Research, described the results as “short on excitement and long on reliability”. \nThe results mark the conclusion of a five-year strategy that has involved reducing the number of tied inns — those owned by Greene King but run by independent landlords — while investing in the directly managed or retail business, which hosts brands including Hungry Horse, Old English Inns and Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill. \nThe tied estate has almost halved in size over the five years, with 735 pubs either having been sold or taken over by the managed business. But the Spirit acquisition will partially reverse this trend, adding 416 tenanted sites to Greene King’s estate. \nThe tied-pub model, whereby publicans buy beer from their landlord in exchange for a discount on rent, has been turned on its head by the previous government’s Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act . The legislation, which received royal assent in March, means major pub companies must offer their tenants market rents instead of “wet rent” in the form of beer. \nMr Anand said some of Greene King’s tenants would take up the so-called market rent only option when it comes into force next June, but declined to estimate how many. “In time that’s something we will be able to give more guidance on,” he added. \nGreene King shares were 1.4 per cent higher at 856p in late morning trading in London.
