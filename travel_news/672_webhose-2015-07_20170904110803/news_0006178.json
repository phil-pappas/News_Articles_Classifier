This is just an eight-seat offering in comparison to the 14-17 seats available on its other long-haul aircraft, giving even more exclusivity and privacy to premium customers. \nThe arrival of the 787-9 will coincide with the redeployment of the airline’s reconfigured 747-400 fleet which will begin to return to scheduled operation in the autumn. The first of the 18 aircraft will return to its network in September 2015 following a cabin face-lift, installation of a new Panasonic eX3 next generation in-flight entertainment system and the addition of 16 more Club World seats. \nThe revamped jumbos will operate on selected flights from London Heathrow to New York JFK, Chicago, Lagos, Dubai, Boston, Riyadh and Kuwait, with further routes to be added by BA in summer 2016 as more upgraded units return to the air. \nBA has a total of 42 787s on order, of which eight are already delivered and now in service on routes between London Heathrow and Austin, Chengdu, Chennai, Hyderabad, Montreal, Philadelphia, Seoul and Toronto, having first entered long-haul scheduled operation with the carrier in September 2013. According to Boeing’s customer Order and Delivery Summary, BA has now taken delivery of all of its 787-8s with its remaining Dreamliner commitments split between 22 787-9s and 12 787-10s. \neTN is a media partner for Routes.
