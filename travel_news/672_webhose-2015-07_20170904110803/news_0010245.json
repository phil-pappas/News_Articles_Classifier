Others fainted, or left the theatre, nauseous and trembling, before the film was half over. Several people had heart attacks, a guard told me. One woman even had a miscarriage, he said.”\n127 Hours - 2010:\nJames Franco stars as mountain climber Aron Ralston in this movie, which includes a rather graphic amputation scene.\nFor some audience members, though, the horrifying moment was a little too much to take, with reports of more than 15 people fainting and three people suffering seizures at different screenings.\n“I started to feel like I was going to throw up,” audience member Courtney Phelps told The LA Times . “So I went to the bathroom, and then I started feeling dizzy and my heart started racing. I have never had, even remotely, an experience like this. I’m a television producer. I know this stuff is not real.”\nRowan Virbickas blacked out, fell to the ground and began convulsing after seeing the film in Sydney, reported the Herald Sun .\n“Girls were screaming, everyone was panicking - an ambulance was called and everything,” he said.\n“They thought I was having a seizure. When I came to, I remembered about 30 seconds of the footage.”\nJames Franco in 127 Hours, which featured a graphic amputation scene. Source: Supplied\nCloverfield - 2008:\nThe premise of the movie is that it’s footage from a handheld camera, filmed as a group of friends try to escape a monster that is rampaging through New York.\nBut the shaky footage not only terrified some audience members, it also caused them to vomit.\n“My wife had to stop watching multiple times,” wrote blogger Dan Rua after seeing the film.\n“The first girl we spoke to after the movie felt queasy. Someone was throwing up in the bathroom afterwards.”\nAnother audience member wrote on IMDB : “I had to get up and leave the theatre for nearly 20 minutes just to keep from hurling”.\nAccording to Dr. Michael G. Stewart, the reaction was nothing more than “a classic case of vertigo”.\nHe told CNN at the time of the movie’s release that people going to see the film at the cinema should take a dose of anti-vertigo medicine beforehand.\n“It might not protect you from all the symptoms, but it could, and it certainly can’t hurt,” he said.\nIt wasn’t the monster that was scary, it was the way it was filmed.

Source: AP\nSnowtown - 2011:\nThe Aussie film about the “Bodies-in-Barrels murders” in South Australia turned out to be a health risk for some audience members when it was released.\nOne person fainted and about 20 people a week were leaving the cinema in distress, according to Cinema Nova general manager Kristian Connelly .\n“People usually walk out because they’re bored, but this film makes people dash to the exit doors,” he said at the time.\n“They can’t even cover their eyes or block their ears. They just want to leave and not return.\n“A scene where it is suggested that a dog is about to be killed has caused the most consistent amount of people leaving the theatre, and yet the film has been particularly successful at Nova.”\nLucas Pittaway and Daniel Henshall in Snowtown.
