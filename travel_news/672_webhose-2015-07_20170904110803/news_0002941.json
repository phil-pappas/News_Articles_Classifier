The bridge even has a seating area in the middle for people to take a rest. It can also support those who ride bicycles to cross the island in search of exploration. \n\"Riding bicycles on the floating bamboo bridge will give you a sense of adventure. It will also give you a unique experience like cycling above water,\" said Chai Nat Governor Suttipong Juljarern. The bridge is regarded as a gimmick, part of the governor's policy to promote Chai Nat as a muang chakkayan, which means a bicycle-friendly city. \nKoh Mueang Thao U Thong is located in Krachap Yai pond and covers an area of 1,160 rai. The bridge was initiated by the governor and built with the cooperation of the locals. \n\"Chai Nat is suitable for a cycling campaign because the city is not overcrowded. Locals normally ride their bicycles in their daily lives. We know the concept of sharing the road with bicycles,\" he said. \nThe governor, himself, is a keen cyclist. \n\"I have ridden my bicycle to and from work since the first day I was assigned to the office. Cycling is also my hobby and I like it because I can greet people along the way,\" said Suttipong. \nIn his opinion, riding a bike has helped him get closer to the people. They see him as a down-to-earth person who is friendly and can be approached to voice their concerns or problems. \nBy day, he wears his civil servant's uniform with black leather shoes, after work he puts on a bicycle helmet, gloves and polarised cycling sunglasses with a shining red edge. His bike is not brand new, but a second-hand bicycle with a basket on the front. \n\"I also bike to the morning market, to lunch and to places that are not too far, or when I do not need to rush,\" he said with a smile. \nDuring weekends, his uniform stays in the wardrobe and he changes into bright cyclist clothes. \n\"Cycling is good for the health. There are many in Chai Nat who had been sick for a long time and got better or were cured after they began exercising regularly by riding bicycles,\" he said, adding that cycling can also lead to the formation of friendships among local people. \n\"I found places that I haven't reached before, such as Khao Khayai, by riding my bicycle. The mountain is like a deserted hill as the soil is red and there are not many trees,\" he said. When he learned that the area is owned by the government, he organised a biking activity in May and asked participants from all walks of life to join cycling and tree-planting activities at Khao Khayai. \n\"I wanted to plant trees to make it a green area for the people,\" he said. \nThe mountain covers an area of 1,000 rai and also has a natural pond. It is about 8km away from the city. In future, it is possible that Khao Khayai will be further developed to become a cross-country cycling park. \nThe governor also has a plan to have more cycling lanes built in the city. \n\"The government set aside a 60 million baht budget for us to build a 2.5m wide bike lane along both sides of the road from the city to Manorom district. Next year, the Department of Highways has set aside a budget to help improve our roads to have more bike lanes,\" he added. \nFor this year, though, Chai Nat already has its all-year round biking activities scheduled. Since January, the governor has joined hands with the public and private sectors to launch the \"12 Months Of Cycling\" campaign (see the box for more monthly activities during the rest of the months of the year). \n\"During the past six months, our monthly biking activities received nationwide attention. More cyclists from other provinces have joined in our racing competitions. \n\"For those who want to bike for leisure, Chai Nat has everything to offer, ranging from biking routes along rice paddies, rivers, historical and cultural attractions and mountains,\" he said. \nThe Chai Nat Cycling Club also offers volunteer guides who can take cyclists around many places in the province. The club also rents bicycles. \nIn addition to the natural trail to Krachap Yai pond, visitors can visit local temples, markets, traditional cloth-weaving centres and handicraft centres. Many of the routes also include biking along rice fields and river banks. \n\"I am certain that after you have a biking experience in Chai Nat, you will love our province and want to come back for more,\" he said. \nChai Nat Governor Suttipong Juljarern is currently recovering following an accident where he fell off his bike at Khao Khayai. Like many, he will join the 'Bike For Mom' campaign next month. \nKoh Mueang Thao U Thong has a 10km cycling route around the island. Also provided are bicycles for rent for just 20 baht. Those who rent bicycles are not allowed to cross the bamboo floating bridge. Besides the biking route, there are wild birds and also food and snack stalls on the island. \nThe green rice field turns golden yellow around August, when Chai Nat launches its 8th cycling race to promote the natural biking route. \nThe monthly biking races are open for anyone to join as the aim is to promote Chai Nat as a destination for biking. \nA short bicycle ride from Neun Kham temple stands another Lao Wiang cloth-weaving centre located in a small alley in the Moo 5 community. This group is called the Housewife Group of Farmers Weaving Cloth of Moo 5. The centre has about 20 members and can be another stop for those who want to see alternative designs of Lao Wiang woven clothes. The centre is open daily from 8am to 5pm. \nThe Tha Chin River is now fully covered with water hyacinth. \nThe Ban Aoy Woven Water Hyacinth Group has turned the valueless water weed into exportable products. The group was founded in 1987 by Charuayporn Kerdseam with the support from the Community Development Department to reduce the number of plants that covered the waterways. Starting with just 15 members, they learned to weave dried plant stems into keychains and baskets. The process starts with harvesting stems of 1m-long water hyacinth and letting them dry under the sun for about two weeks until they become light brown straps. More designs have been created and today a group of 70 people makes not only womenâ€™s bags and baskets, but also home decorations such as lamps, sofas, chairs and slippers.
