With almost 20 years’ experience in high end hotels and resorts across the globe, Thomas joins AVANI Seychelles this month and will guide the team in the resort’s first lead up to high season and beyond. \nThis new GM position in the Seychelles is not the first AVANI role for Thomas, who previously headed a task force in Sri Lanka, looking after the coastal escape of AVANI Kalutara Resort and the contemporary-designed AVANI Bentota Resort & Spa. Prior to that he was GM of Anantara Hua Hin Resort & Spa in Thailand, part of the Minor Hotel Group, parent company of AVANI Hotels & Resorts. Thomas started his career in hospitality at the Inter-Continental in Cannes working in both F&B and Rooms. He then specialised in F&B and worked his way up through the ranks working in hotels from Europe to Africa and from South East Asia to the South Pacific, with time spent working in France, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco, Thailand and New Caledonia, as well as a few years spent in the Indian Ocean in Mauritius, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Prior to joining Minor Hotel Group in 2013, Thomas was GM at The Residence Maldives during the property’s pre-opening and opening period. A French national, Thomas has a Degree in Hotel Management from Gold Coast Griffith University in Australia, and speaks French, English and Thai. A dynamic, creative leader, Thomas is a hands-on manager who exudes energy and hospitable professionalism. His quest is to continue to provide guests with the high level of relaxed, customer-centric services for which AVANI Seychelles is fast becoming renowned. It is a role he is looking forward to. “I am delighted to take over the management of AVANI Seychelles and I’m eager to work with its excellent team with the objectives of providing our guests with truly memorable experiences and to strengthen the positioning of our resort as one of the market leaders.” AVANI Seychelles Barbarons Resort & Spa opened in February this year offering 124 guest rooms and suites with stunning garden or ocean views, two restaurants, a pool, a shisha bar and private dining, as well as AVANISPA. The resort promises a relaxed ambience for romantic couples, as well as a kids club for family-friendly holidays. There is also a wide range of activities for those looking for more than a beach break, with mangrove trails, tennis, snorkelling and diving, as well as yoga, cooking classes and a unique Creole fair.
