(AP) -- A planned pot-friendly ranch resort in southwest Colorado has been snuffed before it opened. The 170-acre CannaCamp resort touted weed-friendly activities such as hiking and fishing. But a deal with the landowner fell through, and the marijuana-tourism company promoting CannaCamp announced Thursday that the resort won't open after all. The MaryJane Group, which runs marijuana-friendly inns in Denver and Silverthorne, announced that it hopes to find a new home for CannaCamp by 2016. Guests who already booked stays starting at $395 per person per night are being offered stays in the bed-and-breakfasts instead. CannaCamp had a tentative agreement to operate on an existing ranch just outside Durango. But the deal fell through after the CannaCamp announcement last month made international headlines and became the butt of jokes on late-night TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T23:22:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
