The Peña Boulevard Station, located at 61 st and Peña Boulevard will be the sixth eastbound stop on the trip from Denver Union Station to the airport. The travel time from downtown to DIA will be 37 minutes with trains running every 15 minutes during peak times. The travel time from 61 st and Peña to DIA will be approximately five minutes.\n“This new station provides a convenient access point into RTD’s regional rail system for commuters and other riders from the growing northeast metro area,” said David Genova, RTD’s interim general manager and CEO. “This improvement would not have been possible without our long-term partnership with Denver, its airport team and the landowners, who worked together to create an asset that will significantly benefit the region.”\nThe station will include the train platform, a public plaza and an 800-car parking lot that is funded and operated by DIA. The station will be accessible from Tower Road and will serve as the catalyst for the 400-acre transit-oriented development named “Peña Station”, strategically located near DIA.\nThe transit-oriented development (TOD) is planned as a sustainable mixed-use development of office, hotel, retail, multi-family and healthcare commercial real estate. This master-planned, mixed-use transit community is bordered on the south and west by permanent open space. It will have direct access to the hiking and biking trails of the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge to the west via a pedestrian trail below Peña Boulevard.\n“The transit oriented development at Peña Boulevard Station validates the Mayor’s vision of an Aerotropolis: the airport serving as a catalyst for regional economic development around its perimeter,” said airport CEO Kim Day. “Airports around the world are increasingly using development opportunities to enhance the economic benefits to their airports and their communities and while many are ahead of us, we are now well on our way.”\nAs a result of the new station and corresponding community development, the northeast metro community will experience numerous benefits including:\nImproved public transit and regional access Additional work force housing in proximity to the Northeast Metro Areas’ two longest employment centers, DIA and Fitzsimons Significant employment opportunities in proximity to the surrounding residential areas Additional amenities for surrounding Denver communities: parks and open space, public plaza, trails – including access to the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge and Open Space west of Peña Boulevard\nAt Peña Boulevard Station, four property owners, including DIA and L.C. Fulenwider, Inc. came together to jointly plan and entitle their properties. They also agreed to an overall finance plan to fund all of the initial infrastructure. Fulenwider will act as lead developer for the TOD.\n“This rail stop, anchored by the Panasonic Enterprise Solutions Company headquarters facility, will create a unique smart sustainable transit-oriented development which will set the stage for the next generation of transit-oriented developments in North America,” said Cal Fulenwider, President of L.C. Fulenwider Inc.\nThe first tenant of the development will be the 112,000 square-foot headquarters facility for Panasonic Enterprise Solutions Company. With Panasonic’s involvement, Peña Station will be developed as a global showcase of public/private development. It is designed to be a smart, sustainable community that reflects the true live-work-play community envisioned by Mayor Hancock for the “Corridor of Opportunity” between DIA and downtown.\nThe community, developed in partnership with Panasonic, will be patterned after Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town, which they developed in Japan. The Sustainable Smart Town aspires to blend nature and cutting edge technology into an “Eco and Smart” lifestyle.\nFurther, it will be great example for the world to see how Denver and its partners have worked together to utilize the strength of the airport to generate economic growth and job creation while also creating a stronger community.\nWork on the Peña Boulevard Station is underway and will be complete for the opening of the East Rail Line in the spring of 2016. Construction of the Panasonic facility will begin in October and will be complete by the end of 2016.\nSource:- Denver International Airport\nRelated Posts Denver International Airport To Turn Off Lights on Iconic Mustang Statue, Entrance Signs for Earth Hour 2015 Spare Change Donation Program For the Homeless Takes Off at Denver International Airport Denver International Airport Passenger Traffic Flat in September MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
