The company’s inaugural run, entitled the Royal Enfield Desert Relief Ride, is scheduled to take place from January 16-28, 2016. \nThe ride will include an all-encompassing tour of Rajasthan, from the outskirts of Jaipur all the way to Jaiselmer. Riders will venture south to Jodhpur, followed by Kumbalgarh where participants will have an opportunity to visit the Kumbalgarh fort. Eventually, the tour will conclude back in Jaipur, after performing a free eye and dental camp near Pushkar. Unlike RRI’s horseback initiatives, which typically involve camping, the motorcycle rides will include overnight stays in some of India’s most incredible ancient forts and other unique dwellings. \nFor the humanitarian aspect, the motorcycle ride will focus on 2 programs, RRI’s Sanitation Program, through which participants will help dig a well and build a bathroom in a village close to Harasar, and it’s free Eye and Dentistry Program in the village of Alniyawas, near Pushkar. \nThe Royal Enfield Motorcycle is widely perceived to be the stuff of legends. There are quite a few motorcycle tours which currently go through The Himalayas, Rajasthan and Southern India, but none offer RRI’s branded humanitarian component, making this a unique experiential offering. Relief Riders International has been delivering much-needed aid to rural India for over a decade now and has helped more than 22,700 people to date. In 2010, RRI received the United Nations NGO Positive Peace Award. \n“Since we started organizing these rides back in 2004, RRI has been at the forefront of the volunteer vacation industry, combining unique outdoor adventure with once-in-a-lifetime volunteer opportunities. The motorcycle rides will be an extension of our already-established programs,” remarks Alexander Souri, RRI’s Founder. “With these new projects coming to fruition, I believe RRI and its future riders have a great opportunity to do even more good in this world. I couldn’t be more excited!” \nThe maiden motorcycle ride will bring participants through The Thar Desert of Rajasthan. The company is also currently at the drawing board planning a Himalayan Motorcycle ride for July of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T03:12:14.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
