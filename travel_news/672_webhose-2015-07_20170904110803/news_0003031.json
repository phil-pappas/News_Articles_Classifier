In addition to hosting hundreds of UP CARES events annually, and conducting radio and billboard rail safety reminders, Union Pacific launched its first social media-based campaign in June urging photographers taking high school senior photos to stay off the tracks. In its first month, more than half a million Facebook and Twitter users were reached through the campaign, which can be viewed at up.com/photosafety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:08.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
