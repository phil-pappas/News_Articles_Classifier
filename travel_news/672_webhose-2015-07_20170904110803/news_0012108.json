Creative personalities from all over the world have joined forces in Music City since the 1920s and the result has been pure magic.\nBut there’s something more these days. A perfect storm of chef-driven eateries and high expectations has inspired a surge of interest in Southern cooking traditions with a modern touch to relaunch Music City with another tagline – Food City.\nA burgeoning culinary scene is striking a chord with Nashvillains and luring in a new breed of travellers.\n“There’s a lot to love about Nashville’s creative vibe,” says hometown boy Patrick, a waiter from The Farm House on Almond St in Downtown – a paddock-to-plate spot drawing foodies from far and wide.\n“We’ve gone way past the standard ‘meat and three’ and fried chicken dripping in oil. There’s a sophistication and intelligence with the Nashville food scene nowadays, it’s progressing and becoming as important as the music.”\nHalfway back to the kitchen with our orders, Patrick turns and waxes lyrical in timely fashion.\n“The food sings, too, you see.”\nPatrick was well on the way to a meaty tip from six Aussie APT guests soaking up the Southern hospitality.\nWhile the boot-scootin’ rumble and good-time music jam reverberates out of the crowded, neon-lit honky-tonks at every 10 paces, it’s just as important to know where the best food haunts are.\nHere are six to consider:\n The Farm House pork belly.

Especially our farm-to-fork approach here.”\nSo, what to eat? Try a starter of double devilled eggs with ham and smoked salt, before tearing through the rib-eye served with mushrooms and turnips, red wine, cipollini onion, salad, jus and a tomato gravy, or the Rabbit Three Ways, chicken-fry confit haunch, seared confit breast or the grilled tenderloin with flageolet beans and crouton tossed with charred celeriac and black garlic puree.\nThe Farm House’s decor standout is the restored barn wood, Tennessee heirlooms and modern touches with lighting.\nIt’s a restaurant with heart, too. Military past and present receive half-price meals “always and forever”, says Cioccia.\nthefarmhousetn.com\nHUSK\nAuthentic Southern food at its best on Rutledge St is popular for a constantly changing menu.\nWe started with a choice of cocktails (under $10) and a serve of Shrimp and Grits, then munched on Crispy Pig Ears and tackled a main of pork, potatoes, cabbage as well as shiitake mushrooms catfish with brussels sprouts, chestnuts and apple.\nhusknashville.com\nTHE STOCK-YARD\nIt’s been named as one of the top 10 steakhouses in the US – and for good reason. The Stock-Yard has been satisfying the appetites of natives for more than 35 years, dishing up certified Angus beef, lobster, fresh seafood and ribs in a rustic, historic setting where quirky and heritage stockyard memorabilia adorns the walls.\nThis one’s hard to top for Nashville dining with a point of difference. Your dining experience may be enhanced or diminished, depending on your musical taste, by a flash appearance of a country music artist slipping in for a few tunes to entertain guests.\nstock-yardrestaurant.com\nROLF AND DAUGHTERS\nThis northern Italian restaurant in Taylor St finds the balance of infusing Southern ingredients with delectable dishes that include rigatoni lamb, taleggio tortellini and farro spaghetti.\nThere’s a sense of adventure in the food, too, including seaweed butter on sourdough or scarlet turnips with yoghurt and fennel or the dry aged beef tartare, smoked mussels, chickpea and toast.\nIn the two years it’s been open, Rolf and Daughters has carved out a reputation as the best Italian eatery in Nashville.\nrolfanddaughters.com\n Nashville, Tennessee skyline on the Cumberland River.
