They may sleep less, exercise less, and experience more stress — all of which can lead to weight gain, he said.\nJon Hamm rocking the dad bod.

There was a difference.\nAfter becoming a first-time dad, a typical 180cm man who lives with his child will gain an average of about 2kg, the study suggested. A same-sized man who does not live with his child can expect to gain nearly 1.6kg.\nBut a 180cm man who does not have children typically loses about 700 grams over the same time period, researchers found.\nThe study found men who lived with their children were a little heavier to begin with, on average, and ended up heavier than the absent fathers and the men who didn’t have kids.\nAccording 2011-12 figures from the ABS , 70 per cent of Australian males are overweight or obese, compared to 56 per cent of women.
