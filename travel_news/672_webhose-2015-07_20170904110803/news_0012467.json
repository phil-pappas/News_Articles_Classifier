Yet in some ways it has become almost too familiar, a celebration that compresses America’s clamour for nationhood into a 24-hour window and one flash of fireworks. The reality was, of course, more long-winded, beginning in 1765 with the formation of the Sons of Liberty – a body of like-minded Massachusetts “Patriots” increasingly furious at heavy-handed rule from London. That anger ebbed through a series of acrid battles with British forces that concluded with American victory on the field in 1781, and at the treaty table in 1783. It is a story that, more than two centuries on, lends itself to travel, the pertinent chapters of those two seismic decades taking place across the “Thirteen Colonies” that made up British territory in the New World (from Georgia in the south to New Hampshire in the north), especially in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Virginia. Further information: visitusa.org.uk or discoveramerica.com . December 1773 - Boston What happened: Tension had been building – over unfair taxes and a lack of democratic representation in parliament – between colonists and the authorities across the Atlantic long before the American Revolution’s trigger incident, the “Boston Tea Party”. However, that event has come to encapsulate the rupture between America and Britain. On December 16 1773, anger over customs duties due on tea waiting to be unloaded from three ships erupted into a protest that saw 342 chests tipped into Boston harbour. • Boston city guide What remains: The exact location of this sabotage act has never been proven, but it may have occurred at the east end of what is now Pearl Street. This is not featured on the “Freedom Trail” ( thefreedomtrail.org ), the 2.5-mile heritage route through the Massachusetts state capital, but 16 other hot spots are, including the Old South Meeting House, where a debate on the morning of December 16 lit the fuse, and the Bunker Hill Monument, which recalls a battle in the ensuing Revolutionary War, on June 17 1775. The “Freedom Trail”, a 2.5-mile heritage route through the Massachusetts state capital Photo: AP/FOTOLIA How to do it: A seven-night, room-only break in August at the five-star Intercontinental Boston (the closest hotel to the Tea Party “site”), including Virgin Atlantic flights from Heathrow, costs from £1,336 a head with Expedia (0330 123 1235; expedia.co.uk ). Further information: discovernewengland.org April 1775 - Lexington and Concord What happened: Protest turned to violence in the form of the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19 1775), sparked when British soldiers, stationed in Massachusetts to control the volatile situation, tried to capture Patriot supplies stored at Concord, in what are now the north-west outskirts of Boston. The shots fired by the American militiamen who rumbled the plan were the first of the war. They forced a British retreat that would set the tone for the coming conflict. What remains: The battle site is preserved as Minute Man National Historical Park (001 978 369 6993; nps.gov/mima ; free). The prime artefact is the replica North Bridge, the focal point of the action, which spanned the River Concord at the time. The five-mile “Battle Road Trail” between Concord and Lexington traces the path of British backtracking. The five-mile “Battle Road Trail” between Concord and Lexington Photo: AP/FOTOLIA How to do it: Complete North America (0115 961 0590; completenorthamerica.com ) offers a “Magnificent Massachusetts” fly-drive which explores the state in detail over 14 nights, and would allow you to pass through Concord. From £3,099 per person, with flights and car. Further information: massvacation.com July 1776 - Philadelphia What happened: The Declaration of Independence was the newborn America’s first cry. It came from the Continental Congress, the fledgling government for the rebel colonies, in Philadelphia, on July 4 1776, drafted by Thomas Jefferson. What remains: Independence Hall, the 1753 structure where the Declaration was adopted (tours $1.50/£1), is part of Independence National Historical Park (001 215 965 2305; nps.gov/inde ). So is the iconic Liberty Bell, which was probably not rung on July 4, but may have added to the peals that sang to the city when the Declaration was read in public on July 8. The best-known copy of the document is in the Rotunda for the Charters of Freedom at the National Archives Museum, in Washington DC (001 877 444 6777; archives.gov/museum ; free). How to do it: The American Road Trip Company (01244 342099; theamericanroadtripcompany.co.uk ) can arrange a “Capital Region Cruiser” road trip that takes 14 days to tick off Philadelphia and Washington DC, as well as portions of Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina. From £1,399 per person, with flights, accommodation and car hire. Further information: visitphilly.com ; washington.org ; capitalregionusa.org August 1776 - New York What happened: America’s bid for self-fulfillment encountered problems in 1776 when British forces seized New York. The significant event was the Battle of Brooklyn (August 27), the largest battle of the war. This saw a sizeable British division defeat its upstart foe on the Guan Heights, at the western limits of Long Island. The battlefield was absorbed by the expansion of New York in the 19th century Photo: AP/FOTOLIA What remains: The battlefield was absorbed by the expansion of New York in the 19th century, and is now covered by one of the city’s prettiest yet unsung attractions, Highland Park – 141 acres in which locals relax amid tennis courts and leafy paths. • New York city guide How to do it: A seven-night break at the New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, on the relevant side of the East River, flying from Heathrow on September 19, costs from £1,745 per person with Virgin Holidays (0344 557 4321; virginholidays.co.uk ). Further information: nycgo.com December 1776 - Washington Crossing What happened: You can glimpse a further fragment of the Revolution – Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851) by Emanuel Leutze – at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (001 212 535 7710; metmuseum.org ; $25/£16). It details the military masterstroke by America’s future leader on Christmas Day 1776, sneaking his men across the icy River Delaware under cover of darkness to bite the unguarded enemy flank. His resulting victory in the Battle of Trenton (December 26) was crucial in restoring US momentum after the concession of New York. What remains: The Pennsylvania side of the waterway, from which Washington set “sail”, is now Washington Crossing Historic Park (001 215 493 4076; washington crossingpark.org; guided tours $6/£3.85). It is host to McConkey’s Ferry Inn, where the general planned his escapade. On the opposite bank, in New Jersey, Washington Crossing State Park, 10 miles north-west of the state capital Trenton, is a wide green expanse with an open-air theatre and 15 miles of nature trails (001 609 737 0623; state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests ; $7/£4.50 per car in summer). How to do it: British Airways Holidays (0844 493 0787; ba.com/holidays ) has fly-drive packages to Philadelphia, 35 miles south-west of the landing site, from £651 per person (two sharing), including direct flights from Heathrow and seven days’ car hire. Further information: visitpa.com ; visitnj.org October 1777 - Stillwater What happened: The war turned firmly in America’s favour at what is now Stillwater, 25 miles north of the New York state capital Albany, in the Hudson Valley. The Battle of Bemis Heights (October 7) saw British troops surrender in the face of superior tactics. The battle was pivotal in France deciding to ally with the US. Saratoga National Historical Park Photo: AP/FOTOLIA What remains: The battlefield is ring-fenced as Saratoga National Historical Park (001 518 670 2985; nps.gov/sara ; free). A visitor centre gives context to the fighting. The Saratoga Monument, in the nearby village of Victory, salutes the triumph via a 155ft marble pillar. How to do it: Bon Voyage (0800 316 3012; bon-voyage.co.uk ) offers a 10-day “Beautiful Upstate Journey” through New York state that traces the Hudson Valley beyond Albany, from £1,855 per person (two sharing) including flights, car and hotels. Further information: nylovesu.co.uk October 1781 - Yorktown What happened: The war reached its climax in Virginia with the Siege of Yorktown, which saw British soldiers pinned there by Washington’s tactical cunning – backed up by French naval muscle. After a long waiting game (September 28-October 19), Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis raised the white flag. Within two years, Britain and America were coming to terms in the Treaty of Paris. A re-enactment at Yorktown Photo: AP/FOTOLIA What remains: The Yorktown site ($7/£4.50) is now part of Colonial National Historical Park (001 757 898 2410; nps.gov/colo). This also encompasses Historic Jamestowne ($14/£9), the location of the first permanent English settlement in the New World. Nearby Williamsburg proffers Colonial Williamsburg (001 888 965 7254; colonialwilliamsburg.com ; from $26/£16.65), a living museum that resurrects the feverish “Revolutionary City” of the 1780s via costumes, parades and re-enactments.
