MARTINE PRUNEVIEILLE \nPROVENCE, France — Many travelers to the French Riviera intent on sunshine and sensual pursuits don't realize that the Cote d'Azur may have a remarkable coastline, but it has an equally remarkable interior. \nThe Riviera is part of the vast department of Provence, one of the most diverse and glamorous regions in France. From Roman ruins to Romanesque architecture; from Riviera beaches to Maritime Alps; from fields of purple (fragrant lavender) to fields of gold (Van Gogh's beloved sunflowers); from sinners (the gamblers and gambolers, courtesans and con artists of the Riviera) to saints (seven Roman Catholic popes held sway in the town of Avignon during the 14th century), Provence has something for everyone. \nIt would indeed take A Year in Provence to experience all that this beautiful and historic region has to offer, so we are going to focus on two spots away from the glitz of the Riviera: Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. \nA city fit for popes \nWhile some may have trouble reconciling the saintly aura of Avignon with the sexy aura of the French Riviera, this historic Provençal city is just about an hour and a half from Marseille. \nAvignon's main claim to fame is that for more than 100 years, from 1309 to 1423, it was home to seven Catholic popes who broke ties with Rome in a movement known as the Schism, Clement V being the first to set up shop here. Proving that popes could hold their own with the continent's royalty in lavish spending and pomp and circumstance, Avignon was the site of one of the richest courts in Europe during the 14th century. \nThe Palais des Papes (Palace of the Popes) hosted dignitaries, dilettantes and downright rogues who flocked here to curry favor with the Holy Father. When the seat of Catholicism returned to Rome, the palace — equivalent in size to four cathedrals — languished. Today, 24 of its rooms have been opened to the public, allowing a glimpse into the Golden Age of the world's largest Gothic palace. \nAfter touring the palace, check out the Chapelle St. Jean, with 14th-century frescoes, as well as the nearby Petit Palais. The latter, once the archbishop's palace, contains Italian paintings dating from the 13th to the 16th centuries, most notably Botticelli's Madonna and Child . \nAvignon Cathedral, better known as Notre-Dame Des Doms d'Avignon, rises majestically next to the Papal Palace. Originally built in the 12th century in Provençal Romanesque style, the cathedral was quickly overshadowed by the grandiosity of the papal digs. \nPerhaps to compensate for that, various additions to Notre Dame have resulted in a clashing mix of styles, from Byzantine to Baroque. The cathedral contains the mausoleum of Pope John XXII, immortalized in Umberto Eco's novel Name of the Rose . \nWith its vast collection of monuments, museums, historic buildings, ancient churches and chapels, and the intact ramparts which surround the city, Avignon richly deserves its UNESCO World Heritage ranking. However, I was taken aback by the ubiquitous graffiti on the magnificently rendered buildings, and couldn't help wondering if the city fathers might have provided these would-be-artists with canvases other than 800-year-old façades. \nAvignon lies on the bank of the Rhone River, and at one time you could cross it on the picturesque Pont d'Avignon. Alas, that's not possible today, as only four of the original 22 pilings remain. \nYou may not be able to cross the bridge, but seeing the graceful scallops of the remaining piles (one holds the tiny Romanesque/Gothic chapel of Saint-Benezet) may cause you to hum that ditty learned in nursery school: \nSur le pont d'Avignon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:42:45.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
