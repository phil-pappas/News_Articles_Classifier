She said it is her privilege to perform those weddings.\nHer decision came after her colleague, Municipal Judge C. Allen McConnell, said he didn’t marry a same-sex couple earlier this week because of his religious beliefs. Another judge was brought in to perform the wedding the same day.\nThe court typically uses a weekly rotation of judges to perform marriages and handle other unscheduled matters. McConnell was on duty Monday when he refused to perform the wedding.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
