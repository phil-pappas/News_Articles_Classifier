Besides physical things, Drew said, there are intangibles that fall under the amenities category and are granular. They’re geared to getting the guest to stay there again. Drew said Avant’s database houses customer information such as if they like to stay in a specific room or on a certain floor. Based on previous visits, he said, his staff will know to stock the room with favorite candy bars or soft drinks. The same level of information is gathered at Hyatt Regency Buffalo. According to General Manager Jay Dellavecchia , “The bartender knows your favorite drinks; they’re in the system and part of our DNA.” “We have a lot of business travelers, and we try to get to know them as people. We learn their likes and dislikes, all the little details,” Drew added. “They can get to know Tabitha at the front desk or Johnny at the bell stand, but we try to solicit feedback from customers to learn where we can improve.” Embassy Suites, a Hilton Hotels brand, conducts focus groups to determine what customers really want. “We take those surveys seriously because we want customers to choose us over every other brand,” he said. Lately, the surveys have revealed that they’re looking for more technology in the rooms, including areas to charge multiple devices. Meanwhile, the company is moving toward allowing guests to pick their own rooms online, which could be ideal for the person who stays there often and likes a certain room or floor. Eventually, guests also will be able to use their phones as room keys, and they’ll be able to bypass the front desk at check-in. Dellavecchia said the technology exists in the hospitality industry but isn’t prevalent. “But that’s the future, for sure,” he said. “It all comes down to service,” said Geno Principe , operating manager at the 28-room Mansion on Delaware. “Technology aside, service is key. So we need to know their needs before they ask for it.” Principe said staff at the mansion, which was built in 1869 and opened as a hotel in 2001, will go the extra mile to help those with potentially life-changing requests. In June, Principe said, employees jammed the elevator with “Will You Marry Me?” signs for a man who wanted to get his girlfriend’s attention. He said staff members keep detailed records on guests and take notes about their likes and dislikes. Sometimes they will learn when a customer’s birthday is and surprise him or her with chocolate-covered strawberries, cards or cookies in the room. As for the woman on the elevator, the message was loud and clear. “And it worked, as she said yes,” Principe said. \nWant Buffalo Commercial Real Estate  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:30:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
