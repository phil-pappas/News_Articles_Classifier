However, international traffic remains down by about 4% from the same period last year. As previously reported by the Charlotte Business Journal , that's due to a shuffling of routes by American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL), by far the dominant carrier at CLT. Since the late-2013 closing of its merger with US Airways, American has added flights to several smaller, domestic markets from CLT, but no new international destinations . The local airport saw a 1% increase in operations through the first five months of the year, with 224,444 landings and departures logged. And the airport has moved 54,674 tons of cargo so far this year, a 2% increase from a year ago.
