Invited here by Tourism Ireland in Frankfurt, Martin and Carolin’s blog is called We Travel The World.\nAs the name of their blog suggests, Martin and Carolin travel around the world, showcasing their real-time journeys and broadcasting their stories and experiences through their writing, photos, video and social media. They decided to experience Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way by campervan – so they could inspire their readers and followers to come and discover this part of Ireland for themselves.\nIn Donegal, where they began their Wild Atlantic Way honeymoon, the bloggers took the ferry from Magheroarty to Tory Island and met the King of Tory, Patsy Dan Mac Ruairí; they also visited Sliabh League. Other places on their itinerary included Croagh Patrick, Achill Island, Kylemore Abbey, Dunguaire Castle and the Cliffs of Moher.\nZoë Redmond, Tourism Ireland’s manager for Central Europe, said: “Martin and Caolin’s blog is really popular, so their decision to honeymoon here, and to write all about it, was a fantastic opportunity to create a major impression on their followers, as they explored the Wild Atlantic Way and then shared their experiences. They have been posting lots of great photos and details of their visit online – inspiring their readers to come and discover this part of Ireland for themselves. Blogs and social media are recognised as strong influencers for prospective holidaymakers and we regularly work with them in promoting the island of Ireland.”\nSource:- Ireland\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 Tourism Ireland is Tops For Digital Marketing, According to New Report World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:09:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
