Both hotels have a combined inventory of 520 guestrooms, 15 function rooms including a a grand ballroom at G Hotel Gurney, and nine F &B outlets. Cross usage and signing facilities are available for guests. \nKevin Cheah, executive assistant manager – sales & marketing, G Hotel Penang, said: “With the opening of the 208-key G Hotel Kelawai, we are aiming for meetings, conferences and others events with up to 500 people. Prior to this, we could not accommodate meeting groups of more than 300 delegates.” \nG Hotel Penang intends to court MICE business from Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong through participation in travel tradeshows such as IT&CM Asia in Bangkok and ITB Asia in Singapore. \nCheah explained that these markets are attractive as they have direct air connectivity with Penang and are within three hours of air travel. \n“Being centrally located next to two upscale shopping malls, Gurney Plaza and Gurney Paragon Mall, and near Penang’s famous hawker centre, Gurney Drive, George Town UNESCO World Heritage Site and beaches makes the hotel an ideal place to stay and have meetings,” Cheah remarked. \nMeanwhile, G Hotel Gurney’s grand ballroom was unveiled in June with a new look. A refurbishment project gave the venue new carpets and wallpaper, a permanent LED screen, Bose speaker system, mood lightings, Herman Miller designer chairs and a more robust Internet capability with speeds up from 100MBps to 150MBps. It can accommodate up to 700 people in theatre style.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:50:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
