Britain’s national mapping company is redesigning all 607 of its paper maps of Great Britain. Anyone who buys one of these new-generation maps will have the option of downloading a mobile version of it as well – at no extra cost. The first of OS’s map ranges to get the makeover is Outdoor Leisure (OL). These maps cover all of Britain’s National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The OS Explorer series will be next, then the OS Tour maps and finally the OS Landranger range. The new OL maps are already on sale. The bright blue “mobile” flash on the front cover lets you know the map comes with this free mobile download, which is fully compatible with iOS and Android devices. To redeem it, the customer simply downloads the OS’s free app onto their phone and, once the mobile version of the map is downloaded, the app becomes fully interactive. The OS mobile app is ideal for those walking and cycling in more rural and remote areas Unlike its rivals, OS’s mobile version of the map creates a far more detailed digital snapshot of the landscape. This gives the same information about physical geography and terrain that users get from the company’s much-loved and trusted fold-out versions. So those using this digital map will be able to view, for example, contour lines, trails, footpaths, bridleways, places of historical interest, picnic sites, car parks and pubs on their phone – rather than just an aerial view of what’s around them. This makes the OS mobile app ideal for those walking and cycling in more rural and remote areas, where paths, trails and tracks are not often clearly marked with other online mapping tools. Better still, you do not have to rely on getting a phone signal to use this app. It can be downloaded to your smartphone ahead of time, so whether you’re on a windswept tor in Dartmoor or climbing the fells in the Lake District you’ll still be able to use this digital OS map through GPS. Mobile milestones The app is fully interactive, allowing users to plot and store routes in advance, as well as recording a walk, cycle or run in real time when they are out and about, so that they can explore further at a later date. Nick Giles, managing director of Ordnance Survey Leisure (OSL), says: “More and more people are using maps on smartphones and tablets to navigate the countryside. But many of these digital maps simply don’t carry the details that customers now demand. “This is why we wanted to launch a digital version of our iconic OS maps. These maps give an unparalleled level of detail, giving customers security and reassurance. They remain the definitive guide for any budding or seasoned explorer.” In a separate strand to OS’s push into digital territory, the company also unveiled its online OS Maps service in February. OS Maps offers users access to high-definition online maps that cover the whole of the UK, accessed via your desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile phone. What’s more, OS Maps can be accessed through your normal web browser, so there’s no need to download any software. You simply log on to plan your next adventure. Users can access overview maps, see places of interest, search thousands of walking, running and cycling routes and print standard A4 maps OS Maps allows users to plot routes and check both the distance covered and elevation of the route – the latter is particularly useful for keen runners and cyclists who know that three miles uphill can feel a lot further than three miles on the flat. This map can then be printed in a selection of scales, downloaded to mobile devices and shared with friends online. Customers have the option of registering for the free service, or paying an annual subscription to access additional features. The free service itself is far from basic. It allows users to access overview maps, see places of interest, search thousands of walking, running and cycling routes and print standard A4 maps. Subscribers can unlock a range of additional services. One of the key attractions is the ability to view the maps on the 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 scale. This is the level of detail used on the ever popular OS Explorer “orange maps” and OS Landranger “pink maps”. Shared pathways Subscribers will also be able to print out not only standard maps, but their own plotted routes. Plus they will be able to access more than 400,000 routes that have been stored and shared by other OS enthusiasts. This will include those published by The Good Pub Guide, Country Walking and Trail magazine. It will also allow subscribers to import or export routes from any GPS device; create and share running, cycling or walking routes; and add notes to their own favourite routes. There is also a range of extended printing options allowing printing in A3 or A4 versions, either in portrait or landscape mode. Both the free and subscription service (which costs just under £20 a year) allow users to access five-day weather forecasts for any chosen map area and print out driving instructions. OS’s embracing the future with digital mapmaking and GPS technology does not mean that the humble paper map and cartographer’s art will soon be made redundant. Giles says: “It’s clear to us that the paper map can work alongside digital mapping, playing an important role in creating adventures and helping users explore every inch of Great Britain.” A digital app may be far easier to use in a strong gale, but the paper map will never run out of batteries, even on the longest of rambles.
