Flying from set on the new Air Canada \"rouge\". Smaller seats but the crew now dresses like Justin Timberlake in 2005. #jauntyhats \n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) May 11, 2014 People are irate on this Air Canada \"rouge\" flight. C'mon people! Who needs leg room or comfortable, regular sized seats when you have HATS! \n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) May 11, 2014 Dear @AirCanada Am looking forward to your \"purple\" airline with no seats at all and crew dressed as Prince during his Purple Rain period. \n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) May 11, 2014 \nHe later tweeted a photo of rouge staffers' outfits, just to prove his point. By popular demand, pic of the actually very nice crew of @aircanada rouge. #HipHats #HorribleSeats pic.twitter.com/RiBTRwOaRi \n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) May 13, 2014 \nLowe tweeted, and on Thursday, the airline responded. \nPatrick Khoury, Air Canada's senior director of U.S. sales, told the actor via Twitter that the company brought Business Class seats back to its Rouge flights. @RobLowe Rob: Air Canada reintroduced Business Class seats on Rouge \n— Patrick Khoury (@PatrickKhoury9) July 2, 2015 \nAnd that had Lowe ecstatic. Victory is ours! https://t.co/bw6HUAB49q \n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) July 3, 2015 \nIn a Wednesday news release, Air Canada said it has finished the conversion of its Premium rouge cabin on its Airbus A319 from a three-by-three seat arrangement with a \"blocked middle seat\" to a two-by two seat formation. It has also added an extra 30 per cent of carry-on space, starting this summer. \nPerhaps the lesson here is to tell Rob Lowe anytime you have a problem with Air Canada. The man gets results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T02:07:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
