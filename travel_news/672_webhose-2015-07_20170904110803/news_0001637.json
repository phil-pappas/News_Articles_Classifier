This will seek her services to become Ayurveda brand ambassador as part of the department’s ‘Visit Kerala Scheme’.”\nKerala’s Ayurveda, an ancient system of healthcare famous for its holistic effect on body and mind, draws large number of people from the country and abroad every year.\nWith the entry of Graf, Kerala hopes to rev up the German travellers’ fascination for Ayurveda treatment. About one-third of Kerala’s 1 million international tourists per year are from Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Ayurvedic rejuvenation treatment, which calls for more than a week’s stay at a wellness centre, also ensures longer stay of international tourists in the host country. This is counted to rev up the multiplier effect of tourism revenues.\nRetired in 1999, Graf won 22 Grand slam single titles. She married former world No, 1 in men’s tennis, Andre Agassi, in October 2001. She is the only player, male or female, to win three grand slams in a calendar year five times. Graf was ranked world No. 1 by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) for a record 377 total weeks, the longest period for which any player, male or female has held the No. 1 ranking since the WTA and the Association of Tennis Professionals began issuing rankings.\nRelated Posts Kerala Tourism to host roadshows across Australia and New Zealand MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
