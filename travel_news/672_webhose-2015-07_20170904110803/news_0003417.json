This region is in the north of the Malay Peninsula. The capital of the district is a beach town known for its stunning villas. Villas in Hua Hin are popular destinations for tourists . For hundreds of years, the town has been a desired location. \n\nHistory \nIn the mid-19th century, a province in the northernmost region of Thailand experienced a very serious drought. The drought ruined crop yields and harmed all types of agriculture and livestock. To try and escape the drought, some farmers moved south. They stopped when they found a village with very white sand and rocks running in a row along the water. They named the town Samore Riang, meaning “rows of rocks.” \n\nIn the 1920s, the railroad reached Samore Riang. The director of the railroads built the Railway Hotel. Soon, King Prajadhipok visited the town and found that he was so fond of it; he built a palace near the beach. He named the palace Klai Kang Won, meaning “far from worries.” \n\nIn the 1930s, more palaces were built by royalty. Prince Krom Phra Naresworarit built a group of palaces and named the beach his palace Hua Hin. \n\nIn the 1930s, the railroad was finally built to connect Hua Hin to Bangkok. This made Hua Hin the first beach resort in Thailand. \n\nActivities \nMany of the activities popular at Hua Hin are the same as those popular in beach resorts around the world. However, the distinctively Thai influences set the beach apart from anywhere else in the world. \n\nTourists to the region tend to enjoy fishing off the coast of Thailand for local seafood. Boating is also popular, with guided tours and deep sea explorations being very popular. Kiteboarding is also one of the most popular activities. These are pretty typical of most beaches. \n\nSome of the distinctive features are elephant camping and Thai massage. Elephant camping is an experience in which the campers are allowed to live amongst elephants. They learn to “drive” elephants. You will get to live with the elephants, watch them enjoy themselves, and learn how to herd and motivate the elephants. \n\nThai massage is a very old system of healing that involves Ayurvedic principles, yoga postures, and acupressure. It was invented around the time of the Buddha by a doctor named Jivaka Kumar Bhacca. He is still considered the father of medicine in Thailand. He was born in India and treated the Buddha himself. The practice of Thai massage has changed somewhat since then, but it is still very similar to that early form. The yoga postures are assisted by the giver of the massage, so the patient remains passive. \n\nKiteboarding is very popular in Hua Hin because the waters are so warm and shallow. The wind comes from the northeast at fifteen to twenty-five knots. The southerly wind gusts about fifteen to twenty knots. These make for great kitesurfing conditions. \n\nHua Hin is popular because of the combination of ancient Thai practices and modern beach amenities. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T23:02:27.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
