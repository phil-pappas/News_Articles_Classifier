Clark The Timber Rattlers, a minor league affiliate of the Brewers, play at Fox Cities Stadium in Appleton. By Brian E. Clark , Special to the Journal Sentinel July 17, 2015 The Beloit Snappers are a Class A minor league team affiliated with the Oakland Athletics. Travel Wisconsin The Madison Mallards are part of the Northwoods League, a summer baseball league made up of the top college players in the Midwest. \nOn a warm summer night, there are few things Mike Kunesh would rather do than head to the Fox Cities Stadium in Appleton and take in a Timber Rattlers minor league baseball game. \n\"Absolutely. It's kind of like stepping back in time 30 years or so for me,\" said Kunesh, a Realtor who grew up in Marinette rooting for the Brewers. \"When I go there, I can just shed my stress and let it fade away. No better place for me to do that.\" \nKunesh is a 45-year-old Appleton resident who has had season tickets for nine years. But he said he was a fan long before then. This summer, he has six passes, so he often goes with his wife and four kids. Other times, he takes in games with friends or business associates. If he really wants to impress clients, he'll book one of the stadium's VIP suites. His regular seats, however, aren't bad: right behind the home team's dugout. \nKunesh, who played baseball growing up, called the Timber Rattlers' modern venue \"first class for a minor league team.\" \n\"And they keep improving it, too. If you aren't a regular like I am and you only went once every couple of years, you might think you were coming to a new stadium each time,\" he said. \nIn his youth, Kunesh said he was a \"coveted\" right fielder. \n\"Actually, I was a just-above-average athlete,\" he said with a chuckle. \"And to be honest, baseball wasn't really my sport. However, I played a couple of seasons because the Marinette Legion team needed an extra guy or two. So, I put on a uniform, went in and did my best. \n\"My claim to fame, my glory, was a diving catch I made one game that protected the no-hitter that our pitcher had going. However, on the very next play, someone hit a high pop-up to right field. Well, the sun got in my eyes, and the ball went over my head and landed on the grass right behind me. Fortunately for the pitcher, it was listed as an error. But it was a little embarrassing for me.\" \nKunesh called watching a Timber Rattlers' game something of a \"throwback to a simpler time. It's low key, inexpensive, fun, and you can enjoy it with family, friends or clients. It reminds me a lot of games I saw as a kid.\" \nBecause the Timber Rattlers are now affiliated with the Brewers (they were formerly with the Seattle Mariners), he said, fans can see possible up-and-coming stars. They also get the chance to see big leaguers who are back in the minors for rehabilitation before returning to the majors. \nKunesh said he'd seen Scooter Gennett and Khris Davis play (both current Brewers players) with the Timber Rattlers. Years ago, he saw a young Alex Rodriguez play at the old Appleton stadium before he was called up (at age 18) to play with Seattle. Rodriguez is now with the New York Yankees. \n\"You can really tell the difference with those kinds of players,\" he said. \"Whether it's fielding or batting or pitching, they are pretty impressive — even when they've been injured and are returning to the game. They are just so much more dominant than the other players. It's really interesting to watch them up close.\" \nDown in Rock County, Jim Stevens said he likes to take in an occasional Beloit Snappers game with friends. Like the Timber Rattlers, the Snappers are a Class A team where relatively young professional players get experience before moving up to the more difficult Double-A and Triple-A leagues and maybe eventually the majors. \n\"It's just fun,\" he said. \"I like baseball, and these guys play the game well. This is a cozy stadium — like a lot of them in the minors — and it's a real no-hassle experience. When I travel around the region in the summer, I'll go to other minor league games. For guys playing with the Snappers, there's always the chance — or at least the hope — that they'll one day be playing for their parent team (the Oakland Athletics) or maybe someone else.\" \nAbout 55 miles north of Beloit, Scott Anderson was watching the Madison Mallards take on the Kenosha Kingfish in a Northwoods (collegiate summer baseball) League game in early July. \n\"These guys play for some of the best universities in the country, like Ohio State, Vanderbilt, Stanford and other schools,\" he said. \"They may not be pros yet — and they may never make it to that level — but they're really good and entertaining. I go to Brewers games sometimes, but because I live in the area, this is how I get my baseball fix. \n\"And for $10, you can get a seat right down next to the field and see all the action up close and personal. For a baseball fan like me, it doesn't get any better than this here at the 'Duck Pond.' They do a nice job with all the other stuff here, too, with entertainment and skits between the innings sometimes, so the whole family can have a good time coming out to the game.\" \nOther college league teams in the state include the Eau Claire Express, Mequon's Lakeshore Chinooks, Wausau's Wisconsin Woodchucks, the Green Bay Bullfrogs, La Crosse Loggers and Wisconsin Rapids Rafters. \nBrian E.
