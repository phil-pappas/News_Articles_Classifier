Food markets are the perfect spot to take a country’s culinary pulse.\n1. The Queen Victoria Market – known locally as the Queen Vic or Vic Market – is a Melbourne icon and, while locals do their weekly shop in the seafood shed and greengrocer pavilions, it’s the Deli Hall that wows visitors with busy stalls offering everything from cheese to charcuterie.\nThe food market is open five days, Tuesday and Thursday to Sunday, with night markets during winter and summer offering more grazing opportunities.\n Customers check out the range of chocolates at Granville Island Public Markets, Canada.

Travellers can spend hours on Vancouver’s Granville Island , Canada, not only sampling the delicacies in the Public Market’s sheds but also by taking a detour to artist studios and quirky shops or simply lingering in one of the many eateries crafting meals from Canadian ingredients. Borough Market is London’s oldest market. Picture: supplied Source: Supplied\n3. London’s Borough Market has been around for more than 250 years, making it the oldest in the English capital. Though it’s a wholesale destination most of the week, doors open to the public from Thursday to Saturday for foodies to sample supplies from independent producers from around the UK. The market is only a stone’s throw from the Thames so, when the weather’s fine, buy a picnic and find a spot to feast on the riverbank. Tiong Bahru Market, Singapore.

It was established early last century when the enclave’s roaming food hawkers demanded a place to work after authorities tried to move them off the streets, and it’s still one of the most colourful.\nThere’s a wet market on the ground floor of the Art-deco address and upstairs in the hawker market 80 vendors prepare local favourites served for decades.\n Wander from stall to stall at Darwin’s Mindil Beach Markets.

They offer a vast assortment of indigenous and imported delicacies to make this the perfect location for an alfresco nomadic degustation. Tourists take photos as they visit 'La Boqueria' green market in Barcelona. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\n6. Two markets in Spain deserve mention. First, Madrid’s Mercado de San Miguel , now occupying a vintage beaux-arts building that stood empty for years until restored in 2009, is now home to 33 food stalls and a busy cafe precinct. La Boqueria – or Mercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria if you must be formal – is Barcelona’s most popular place to buy provisions. Though there’s evidence a market has been on the site since 1480, the Eiffel-like sheds flanking Las Ramblas date from 1914.\n7. Peru is emerging as one of the world’s newest food destinations – the restaurants in Lima are reason enough to plan a visit – with Mercado Surquillo , close to the up-market hotels in Miraflores, not only stocking neighbourhood kitchens but allowing travellers to try flavours only produced here.", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/23/1227454/053087-5aa9de62-30f3-11e5-82fc-375b5deeaed9.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/23/1227454/053562-10bb0514-2a8c-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/23/1227454/053113-7244af22-2a8e-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/23/1227454/053508-5169620e-2a96-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/23/1227454/053167-5a382c62-2a8c-11e5-acb7-33c75d95366a.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-24T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:53:15.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
