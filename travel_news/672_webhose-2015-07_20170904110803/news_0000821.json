The replies to the questions by Italians, English, Spanish, German, Swiss, Dutch and Belgians had to do with the criteria for selecting one’s preferred means of transport, the method of booking, and the most stressful situations that may be encountered while traveling or preparing for the holiday. \nAccording to the data that emerged from the study done by Voyages SNCF, a high speed rail operator in Europe, that compared the different nationalities of the candidates, as well as their sex and age groups, the results were sometimes surprising, sometimes predictable, but also fun, creating, as a whole, in a sociological ensemble, the \"character\" of Europeans - their similarities and differences. \nThe favorite means of transport \nThe means of transport for long journeys has changed significantly over the years, with the train now the number one preferred means by young people under 24 years of age as well as seniors. Both groups like its convenient price, even with the advent of low-cost carrier (LCC), while the car has suffered steady price increases due to petrol especially in less central countries of Europe. \nIn addition to affordable pricing policies, travelers like trains because of its convenience and lack of time-consuming check-in. Perhaps a surprise, among the main reasons for choosing train travel, was the freedom of weight and size of luggage to carry. Most respondents, however, said they travel more by plane although almost everyone agrees on stress procured from the line to check-in, the advance of two hours at the airport, and the baggage restrictions. The Dutch, German, and Belgians win for exploring Europe by car, especially women and over 55, while car journeys is considered the most stressful by Spaniards. \nThe sources of stress \nAn emotion shared by all Europeans is the strong nervousness caused by delays, the seemingly endless line at check-in, and the restriction on luggage or its loss, the latter being particularly important for women of all nationalities, including Italians and the Swiss. Problems with baggage if overweight, involves having to quickly re-do quickly packing (or rather unpacking) at the airport and having to wear the surplus garments. In this regard, the Italians, Spanish, and Swiss qualify as masters of the \"onion dress,\" exceling closely behind the Belgians. \nThe Spanish, Swiss, and Italians are aligned in identifying the loss of baggage one of the most stressful situations happening when traveling by air, even surpassed by missing a train or plane. For the English, however, reputed for their punctuality, this less of a concerning topic. \nTraveling with children is already in itself a source of tension, and some unexpected data emerged from the responses that identify one of the major problems being the long queues at check-in as well as not being able to obtain a close seat on board. Although one might expect to see Italians at the top of this list, it is the Spanish, Dutch, Belgians, Germans, British and Swiss who are far more concerned about this issue. According to statistics on children travel, however, around 25-28% of the Swiss, Belgians, Dutch, and Germans, opt to travel without children. \nThere is definitely a stress syndrome created by pre-holiday travel that was admitted as a cause of tension between partners from all citizens of the union with an average of around 30%. Who is most in crisis here? The Swiss exceed at 43%. Who is most prim? Of course, the English, but only the men (18%), who apparently do not realize that their partners are stressed, with their percentage rank being at almost 35%. \nAmong the 3 most important factors in booking a trip, the restriction in the luggage comes afloat but only for the Swiss and the British. However, they align with other countries in considering price as the most important factor, with a large percentage for all at around 80-85%. The Germans are the only ones that do not consider the \"baggage\" factor relevant, while they do give importance to the comfort and ease of booking – also important parameters for the other Europeans, by the way. \nThe pro given by train \nWhat are the contributing factors that can entice travel by train? Among all respondents, in the first place there is the possibility to move about while inside the train, enjoy the scenery, and experience the ride in total relaxation. Being an eco-friendly choice is predictably mentioned by the Swiss and Germans, and Italians are the only ones in this case to highlight the opportunity to bring more luggage, while surprising, the Belgians and Spanish are the first to want to sit close to the family. \nOne of the positive aspects of the train is definitely tied to an increased need for everyone to communicate and relate more directly between people. In fact, between the situations mentioned by passengers as the preferred travel by train, emerging in first place is the opportunities to engage in conversation with other passengers, make new friends, and obtain advice by the locals on the cities to visit. It is worth noting that in Italy, as in other countries, the percentage of those who chat with their neighbors is very high in the age range from 45-54, while that percentage is the lowest among the hyper under 24. As to getting advice from the locals, the highest percentage fell in the age range of 45 and over, while teenagers also prefer to be social. \nMost romantic \nHere’s a \"romantic\" note regarding England. More women are bound to make new friends, unlike other countries where the percentage is higher among men, and about 10% of Britons admit to have fallen in love on trains, compared with just over 5% of Italians). Fifteen percent of British women aged 35-44 say the train has made their hearts beat faster!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:08:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
