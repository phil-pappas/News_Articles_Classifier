All of this is in Mandarin. \nAfter a tour of the house, they go outside and walk around the farm, \"milk\" the faux cow and feed the goats. \nInternational tourists in Pennsylvania Dutch country are still the minority, but their influence is growing. Lancaster County has long seen the most visits from our neighbors in Canada, followed by European tourists. \nBut as more Chinese tourists visit the U.S., the local tourism industry wants to make sure Lancaster is one of the first places on their mind after they visit the main metropolitan centers. Lancaster businesses and Discover Lancaster are taking steps to encourage more Chinese tourists. \n\"You're just seeing an emerging Chinese market, so I would say you're just seeing the tip of the iceberg,\" said Mark Andrews, manager at Amish Farm and House. \nThe majority of the 8 million tourists annually visiting Lancaster live on the East Coast and stay for a day. \nBut there's potential to expand that number by attracting people attending meetings and sporting events, along with international travelers, said Joel Cliff, spokesman with Discover Lancaster. \nAfter international travelers visit major tourist destinations like New York City, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, they may come to Lancaster on a second or third visit. \nAnd international travelers often stay longer than a day, providing a boost for local hotels. \n\"It's nice to have these additional pieces of the puzzle to keep growing the tourism pie,\" he said. \nThe National Travel and Tourism Office expects China to be the country with the largest growth in visitors in the next few years. \nThe Chinese economy, at least for a portion of the population, has been good. At the same time, the country has eased travel regulations. In November, China allowed travel visas to extend from one year to 10. \nOn average, the Chinese are taking more trips abroad now, according to the Chinese International Travel Monitor 2014. \n\"That is huge, and that's going to continue to be huge,\" said Peggy Nana-Sinkam, group sales manager with Amish Farm and House. \"You've got the rising middle class. You also have people who can get a visa, and that's encouraging second and third trips to America.\" \nBut \"it's going to take a little bit of time for that big boom, especially in China, to reach us,\" said Jennifer Buchter, managing director of hospitality and sales at Miller's Smorgasbord, Plain & Fancy Farm and the AmishView Inn & Suites. \nIn the meantime, businesses and Discover Lancaster are taking steps to spread the word about Lancaster and find ways to accommodate foreign travelers once they arrive. \nDiscover Lancaster has hosted several familiarization trips to introduce Lancaster to tour operators from other countries over the past few years. They tout the region's Amish history as well its location close to major metropolitan areas and a possible stop between New York and Washington, D.C., or Philadelphia and Niagara Falls. \nBusinesses have dedicated staff to international sales and increased their attendance at international trade shows. \nCompanies have advertised in international tourist publications to connect with families or individual travelers. \nThe Amish Farm and House is ready with scripts for guides in 16 languages and maps for guests in five languages. There's been a shift in the past few years from lots of German guests, to French guests and, in the past two years, Chinese, Andrews said. \nDiscover Lancaster has translated information on Lancaster, including a video, into Mandarin. That version of the local getaway guide should be completed by the end of the year. \nThe agency is also working to get a UnionPay ATM in the visitor center. UnionPay is the national bank card association in China, and its availability here would be an asset when promoting the region. \nAnd once the tourists arrive, they often need translation. Language barriers can make it difficult for visitors to enjoy a site, especially if they're on a tightly scheduled tour. \nAmish Farm and House hired a few tour guides to speak Mandarin instead of relying on tour operators' translators. \n\"Some of them are very good, but some of their English is limited,\" Andrews said. \"So I wanted to make sure that the translation was being communicated properly so that the language barrier didn't change the message. You don't want them to talk about different religious beliefs and that translation turn it into something completely different.\" \nPlain and Fancy Farm also is creating a Mandarin-language brochure to help visitors navigate the property even during a short stop. \nThe amount of money Chinese visitors spend in the area has increased dramatically. \nLooking at the value of Visa credit card purchases in the region ranked by country, Chinese visitors didn't make the top 10 in 2008, Cliff said. But they jumped to No. 2 by 2011, and are second only to Canadians. By last year, Chinese tourists spent more than $1 million on Visa credit cards, Cliff said. \n\"There's a huge amount of untapped potential,\" Buchter said. \nOnline: \nInformation from: LNP, http://lancasteronline.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:25:38.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
