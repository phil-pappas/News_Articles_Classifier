Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The afternoon market on the grounds of Imam Bonjol Stadium in Padang, Indonesia , lasts just one month a year and looks like a nibbler’s paradise. Padang is known across Indonesia for its cuisine and it showed: mountains of fried noodles studded with shrimp chips and whole fried eggs; heaps of snails spiced with turmeric; mounds of tiny silvery anchovies with green chiles; beef long-simmered in coconut milk to become tender rendang; es campur, an icy dessert full of unfamiliar fruits and fluorescent cubes of gelatin. But there are no free samples for the Muslim clientele (nor any tables at which to dine) because in this would-be gourmand’s paradise, eating is strictly forbidden. Not by the vendors but by the Quran; Chapter 2, Verse 185 to be precise, for the month is Ramadan , and the meals are strictly to go, a way for families to avoid the tiresome and tempting task of cooking during the waning hours of the daily fast. See More » “By afternoon, people lazy for cook, not have energy,” said Benny, my wiry, diminutive, pay-what-you-wish guide who took me there, cruelly, at about 3 p.m. Even for non-Muslims, eating and drinking publicly are taboo (or at least quite rude) during daylight hours, so I could only salivate and plot a return when our tour was over to pick up dinner. None of this is to say I was disappointed — this was why I had made Padang, on mostly Muslim Sumatra, the first stop on a four-island Indonesia trip. The next three stops would be in predominantly Christian and Hindu areas. (Though Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population, 33 million of the country’s 250 million people are of other faiths). While in town, I spoke to many residents about fasting — and was surprised to hear that most people do not find it a hardship (though one complained it was a surprisingly ineffective weight loss plan). Others sheepishly admitted to not fasting despite significant peer pressure. Returning alone to break my own informal fast at 6:15 p.m., I found the noodles and anchovies and snails gone and the market closing. I scrambled to buy a whole fish caked in red chiles, an es campur and a few other items for a total of 15,000 rupiah, $1.15 at 13,084 rupiah to the dollar. Each item was unceremoniously dumped into a plastic bag. Back in my hotel, I promptly made a complete mess of the meal. Because the items were meant to be eaten at home, there were no plates or napkins, and no silverware because in Padang you eat with your hands. The now melted es campur I did not even dare open, and it went to waste. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story I found Benny through my hotel, the shiny new HW , a good deal at 365,000 rupiah a night (including an excellent Indonesian breakfast, served post-dawn for non-Muslims). He had a deep and quirky knowledge of the city, informed by the one week a month he spends collecting recyclables for the government, but his price was annoyingly undefined: “free, just pay what you want at the end.” (I paid 200,000 rupiah for about five hours, at the hotel manager’s suggestion.) Our tour had begun in the colonial quarter along the Arau River, now reduced to mostly dilapidated Dutch colonial buildings, including the still somewhat glorious gambrel-roofed former regional headquarters of the Netherlands Trading Society. Benny also pointed out World War II cement bunkers overgrown on the side of the road — the Japanese took over from 1942 to 1945 — and a mix of speedboats and ancient-looking wooden cargo ships at docks along the river. Both went to the Mentawai Islands, which lie in a chain about 95 miles offshore. “The speedboats take surfers,” Benny said. “The wooden boats bring seaweed, sugar, ginger and clove back.” Ramadan and the 90-degree weather seemed to have dulled the town to hibernation levels, at least on this side of the Arau. (Benny, not fasting and seemingly impervious to the heat, made a point of walking on the sunny side of the street.) But across the river, where houses were wedged between the bank and a hill, people seemed to be milling about under the glint of a metallic-domed mosque. I asked if we could cross over a traffic bridge. “Sure! Let’s go!” he said, which is pretty much what he said anytime I asked about anything. The far side had a homier, small town feel, though with a touch of Ramadan-infused slowness. Along the bank, where fishing boats were lined up, there was little activity; a lone crew was unloading its catch, as an official-looking fellow recorded its weight into a notebook. A misspelled food stand offering “GFC Pried Chicken” was closed for Ramadan. The most notable ruckus was the incessant birdcalls emanating from a nearby building; Benny told me it was a trap, meant to trick swallows through an open window into a net. I had what I thought was a long-shot idea: Could I go out on an overnight fishing boat? “Sure, let’s ask!” But a group of fishermen, having iced tea at a ramshackle stand in the shadow of the bridge, informed us that their boats go out two weeks at a time, looking for marlin and other big catches near the Mentawais. The overnight trips I was looking for left from Bungus Harbor, outside of town. \nAdvertisement “Can we try there tomorrow?” I asked Benny. “Why not?” I liked this guy. Farther down the shore we headed back over a wooden-plank suspended footbridge. Benny led me along old train tracks to a minuscule building that had served as a colonial-era train station. From a block away the air was suffused with clove, one of the once-precious spices that drew the European powers to the East Indies in the first place. Inside, men were shaking a stretcher-shaped sieve to remove impurities from the brown buds and then dumping them into a pile. Seeing a gargantuan pile of what arrives in Western supermarkets in tiny bottles was intoxicatingly disorienting. We were to have lunch in predominantly Buddhist Chinatown. “How much further?” I asked, sounding alarmingly childish as I looked out for Chinese characters, ducks hanging in windows, or perhaps a Qing dynasty--inspired gateway. “We’re here,” Benny answered. I hadn’t realized it because this was not an American Chinatown. The Chinese had been present in Indonesia since long before Europeans set foot in America (and were subject to discrimination and violence, even in modern times). So even though the neighborhood is locally translated as Chinatown, it didn’t feel particularly distinct to me, but rather simply a concentration of a religious minority (where the restaurants stay open during Ramadan). \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story And so the restaurant we ate in, Ombak Puruih, served Padang cuisine in classic Padang style, which meant putting a bunch of plates or bowls on the table, allowing you to choose what you want with your left hand and eat with your right. (Bowls of water are always provided for washing.) We had beef rendang, fish caked in red chile, and vegetables, and the meal cost us 92,000 rupiah for two, including a 17,000-rupiah pack of cigarettes for Benny. (Keeping your guide steadily supplied with cigarettes seems to be part of Indonesian law; restaurant smoking prohibitions are definitively not.) The next afternoon Benny picked me up and we went out to Bungus Harbor. The beach was littered with trash; the water, though, was dotted with the most extraordinary wooden fishing boats, with wide outriggers that looked like wings, painted red, white and blue. I was optimistic, but Benny less so, because the moon would be full that night. He explained that many boat owners won’t raise anchor during a full moon, when catches tend to be smaller. But by the shore we met the owner of one vessel who was considering sending the crew out that night. That a woman was presiding over a male crew should not have surprised me: the Minangkabau, the majority ethnic group in the region, are a famously matrilineal society. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:10:03.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
