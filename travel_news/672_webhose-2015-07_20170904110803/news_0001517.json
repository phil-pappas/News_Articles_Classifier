In the eight miles between the next town and our house I counted, the other day, the number of signs on my side of the road that I was meant to read and inwardly digest before reaching home. • Country lanes could be 'defaced' with a million road signs There were exactly 200 of them. If you were to ask me what any of them said, I have to confess that I cannot recall a single one, but they will have told me everything from the speed limit to the direction to take for nearby villages. Too many signs, too little time, for Alan Titchmarsh (Alamy) Someone will no doubt use them all at different times, but I can't imagine that they need to be told quite so much quite so frequently. Maths has never been my strongpoint, but 200 in the space of eight miles means, by my reckoning, that there is a sign every 70 yards along my route. Talk about information overload... • Telegraph View: driven to distraction by road signs Multiply that by the miles of road in this country and it is a wonder we are not sinking under the weight of the metal needed to make them. What happened back in the 50s before all this ironmongery appeared? In my nostalgic haze I long for a return to those elegant finger-posts that had a white circle at the top showing the county, and angled white pointers with clear black script indicating the direction to the next town or village and its distance away. Alan Titchmarsh would love to see some older signs back in the UK (Alamy) Truth to tell, we probably all drive too fast to read them now, since they date from the time of a horse and cart, but I still heave a sigh at their passing and am possessed of a yearning that cannot be assuaged by a massive sign, as big as the side of a house, saying 'Industrial Estate'. • Dame Shirley Bassey's road sign drama During the war all road signs were removed in an effort to confuse the enemy. Did we all get lost? Did no one travel anywhere? Did we bump into one another more frequently? Nope. We managed somehow and had a clearer view of an uncluttered countryside which is now defiled every 70 yards with massive noticeboards, flashing lights, illuminated overhead signs and a road surface that has more stripes down it than a zebra and more humps than a camel. Roadworks and cones get in the way in the countryside (Alamy) Traffic calming? It makes my blood boil. Currently my irritation at the local signage and surfaces is added to by the arrival of rows of orange and white cones which are put out at night by men in lorries with a large blue arrow at the back warning me to keep out of their way. In the morning I discover that one lane of our local dual carriageway is closed. • The road signs that really grab your attention No-one is working on it, but it becomes inaccessible to traffic and causes massive tailbacks. These lorries are peopled by men in high visibility jackets who are quite clearly on piecework. They must be paid per cone, since they are supremely generous in the quantity they are prepared to donate to the nation. I have had enough. I have asked my wife for a rather special present for my next birthday. I want her to hire for me a large white van. I shall follow half a mile behind these cone-placing lorries (out of sight of their rear-view mirrors) and I shall have an accomplice who picks up the cones and stores them in the back of the van. Are workmen paid per cone, asks Alan Titchmarsh (Philip Hollis) The following day we will travel to the local council depot (on the now undefiled road) and sell them the cones, for they clearly require an endless number. Any cash gifts I receive from now on will be invested in shares of a cone manufacturer for, like bakers and undertakers, they are never likely to go out of business. • Road signs to use metric measurements I wouldn't mind so much if a hive of industry went on behind these rows of cones, but the chances are that it will be several days before a gang of men turns up to mend one pothole in a stretch of road half a mile long - the length of closure being necessary in the name of health and safety. (I won't get started on that since we all know where it will lead...) • Billions wasted on pointless pothole repairs Maybe I am quite simply out of kilter with modern times. It would explain why a friend recently gave me a sign which is now fixed to the wall in our kitchen. The many signs of the countryside (Alamy) It reads: 'I long for a time when chickens can cross the road without having their motives questioned.' At least down our way the exercise would be less risky; the traffic is at a standstill.
