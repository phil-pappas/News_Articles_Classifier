The volcano is about 150 kilometres west of Denpasar airport, the main airport for those heading to Bali. Denpasar airport was closed on Thursday because of the ash, along with nearby regional terminals including Lombok.\nThe ash grounded planes from Virgin Australia, Jetstar, Garuda and AirAsia.\nNgurah Rai airport authority chief, Yusfandri Gona, said that many airlines were proposing changes to use bigger aircraft when they resume flying.\n“Virgin has proposed to use an Airbus 330, changing from Boeing 737 800, that they normally use. Some airlines have also proposed extra flights,” Mr Gona said.\n“We expect that the airport operation will be back to normal within three days.” he said.\nThousands of Australians are believed to be stranded in Bali as a result of disruption by the ash plume from the erupting Mount Raung.\nChaos ... passengers queue up at the international terminal at Bali's Ngurah Rai airport in Denpasar.

That case too was postponed unexpectedly.\nHe said whilst the situation was frustrating and unfortunate, it was based on safety considerations.\n“It is unfortunate, nothing much can be done about it. I think generally everyone accepts you can’t control the weather,” Mr Telford said at the airport.\n“I think everyone accepts when a decision is made about safety that safety must always come first, everyone understands that,” he said.\nLawyer Anderson Telford, who was due to fly Bali on Thursday night, complained about information flow. Picture: Salman Al-Farizi Source: News Corp Australia\nMr Telford said however that the information flow about what was happening could have been a little clearer for stranded traveller.\n“It could be clearer. I suppose it is regular but it is repetitive.”\nGold Coast woman Monique Williams and her sister Renee Le Clerc were due to fly home on Jetstar on Wednesday evening after an eight day holiday. They have now rebooked on Air Asia through Kuala Lumpur and hope to be home on Sunday.\nMs Williams said she was initially upset at missing her daughter’s birthday on Saturday but said it is nobody’s fault and one can only laugh about the situation now.\n“It is one of those things that happens, Everyone is pretty angry at Jetstar from what we can gather but if the planes are small and it is not safe to fly then I don’t want to be in a plane that is not safe to fly in,” Ms Williams said.\nShe said gaining information on the situation had been frustrating. She spent 90 minute on the phone at one stage and on another occasion was cut off.\nMonique Williams (left) and her sister Rene Le Clerc wait at Ngurah International Rai Airport in Dempasar, Bali.

Volcanic ash is known to cause serious damage to aircraft and can lead to engine “flame outs”.\nThousands of Australians are believed to be stranded in Bali as a result of flight cancellations.\nThousands more have been unable to travel to the Indonesian holiday Island from Australia.\nJuly is typically one of the biggest months for Aussie tourists visiting Bali, with about 99,000 departures last year.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has over 4000 Australians currently registered in Bali, but a spokeswoman said the real number was thought to be significantly higher.\nSenior meteorologist at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin, Stephanie Bond, said the plume had moved to the south of the volcano which meant Denpasar had been cleared of ash.\n“Most of Bali is clear, there’s just a little bit in the far western parts,” said Ms Bond.\n“We’re expecting conditions to remain the same for the next three days with winds coming from the north.\n“Beyond that, it’s difficult to say, as volcanoes are unpredictable and Mount Raung is continuing to erupt.”\nLong wait ... passengers line up after their flights were cancelled at Bali's international airport. Picture: AP Source: AP\nJetstar Australia and New Zealand CEO David Hall said the situation which has left thousands of Australians stranded was “extremely regrettable”.\n“We share our customers’ frustrations with the situation to Bali,” said Mr Hall.\n“It’s extremely regrettable that our customers’ holidays have been spoiled by these disruptions and that we can’t provide the certainty we would like to due to the unpredictability of the volcanic ash cloud surrounding this airport.”\nHe indicated Qantas may join Jetstar in providing additional services to clear the backlog of passengers once the ash cloud cleared.\n“We have teams working around the clock, monitoring conditions in Bali and assisting customers as best we can in these trying circumstances,” Mr Hall said.\nCausing trouble ...

It began erupting last week causing chaos and cancellation of flights to and from Bali.

Winds generally move due to weather systems, and there’s no strong driver of winds in the area.”\nBali is a favourite holiday destination for Australians. Crowds of foreign tourists were stranded at Bali’s Ngurah Rai airport, waiting for further information about their flights.\nAir New Zealand said a flight due to depart from Bali on Saturday afternoon had been rescheduled to leave early on Sunday, conditions permitting.\nGrounded ...

Virgin is advising customers to call 13 67 89 to rearrange their bookings.\nMelbourne resident Brendan McCarthy was told his flight home from Bali on Friday had been cancelled until at least Monday.\nOther travellers were being told their flights could be delayed until July 23, he said.\n“We’ve been here for two weeks, have changed accommodation three times now,” Mr McCarthy told AAP.\nAs well as missing work, medical appointments and sporting commitments, he and his girlfriend are also facing additional unplanned travel costs that they hope to recoup through travel insurance.\n“A fantastic holiday is now having a really bad ending,” Mr McCarthy said.\nA Perth couple said they had been left without cash after their flight home was grounded.\nRoss and Leigh-Ann McNulty said they spent $3000 to fly their family of four home with AirAsia on Friday after their Jetstar flights were cancelled. But they faced at least another day in Bali after Denpasar airport was closed.\nDelayed ... passengers rest in the international terminal at Bali's Ngurah Rai airport in Denpasar waiting for information of flight delays due to volcanic ash near Indonesia's resort island.

They weren’t able to claim the costs under their travel insurance and were borrowing money from friends.\n“My husband’s self-employed, we might have to end up declaring bankruptcy now because things have got that bad,” Mrs McNulty said.\n“This has just financially ruined us really.”\nMr McNulty said they pleaded with Jetstar to prioritise them for medical reasons, but nothing worked.\n“It’s turning out to be the Bali holiday from hell basically,” he said.\n“We love the Balinese people, but we’ll probably never come back as a result of the debacle of the airlines.\n“I realise they’ve got to put the safety of passengers first, but the actual way they’ve been so quiet and not let us know is just devastating.\n“It’s not good enough, we paid good money to board these flights and the least they could do is look after us when they make so much money.”\nOriginally published as Jetstar and Virgin start Bali flights", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/726848-e6762aec-273c-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "http://t.co/IFbPbA83On", "http://t.co/DM7gOEbx0V", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/727045-e8bec5de-273c-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/309924-be939c3e-27b0-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MtRaung?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bali?src=hash", "http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/home/au/en", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227436/995970-aa611b3c-26c1-11e5-8167-f00e54f05f28.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227436/995944-a7530860-26c1-11e5-8167-f00e54f05f28.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/726874-ebcf5cca-273c-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/home", "https://twitter.com/VirginAustralia/status/619811535972630528", "http://www.flightradar24.com/60,15/6", "http://t.co/1Kwyytrpa0", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/312113-7dc64eea-27b0-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/flightradar24/status/619708659749253120", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/jetstar-and-virgin-australia-begin-flights-from-balis-denpasar-airport-after-it-reopened/story-fnizu68q-1227436998526", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/727019-f01b70ca-273c-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:26:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
