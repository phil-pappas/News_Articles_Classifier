Between 25 July – 27 September visitors can enjoy the grandeur of the State Rooms’ displays, which, this year, recreate the settings for the 62,000 guests who the Royal Family welcomed in the past year to state visits, receptions, garden parties, investitures and private audiences.\nSettings for these occasions, including the Palace Ballroom, transformed for a State Banquet with glittering silver-gilt from George IV’s grand service, will be on display; visitors are also invited to experience how people are welcomed to Buckingham Palace. Visitors curious about what goes behind the scenes won’t be disappointed – also on display will be some of the important ‘tools of the trade’, from the copper moulds used to create ‘chocolate bombe’ desserts to the red leather seating-planner, as well the food and selection of wine to the choice of Her Majesty’s outfits, and porcelain chosen for a State Banquet.\nA visit to Buckingham Palace wouldn’t be satisfying with just the ceremony – there’s plenty of pomp on display too! Admire the knighting stool and a sword used to confer knighthoods and the number of Orders and Decorations on display; and, for the first time, enter the State Rooms through the Grand Entrance, used by those who come to the Palace at the invitation of The Queen, including Heads of State and Prime Ministers. The Australian State Coach will be on display at the Grand Entrance portico, from where Her Majesty departs and returns to Buckingham Palace by carriage for ceremonial processions.\nThe gates and Grand Entrance open to the public on 25 July and multimedia guides are now available for all ages.\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium New Urban Adventure in Singapore makes stopover sightseeing easy PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market World-Renowned Voices Jet In For Conflict Conference In Tribute To The New Season Of Downton Abbey: Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London Introduces New Butler Service", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:02:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
