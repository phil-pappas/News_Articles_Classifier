The new global recognition granted to those historic missions — Concepción, San José, San Juan and Espada — could spur unprecedented investment and development in that sector of the city. “It’s going to be a sea change for the South Side,” said Cindy Taylor , one of the area’s longtime leaders. “There will be unbelievable economic impact.” Taylor, who was president of the South San Antonio Chamber of Commerce for 21 years before launching her consulting firm in 2011, said visitors from across the world will travel to the Alamo City to see the missions because they are now classified in the same league with such structures as the Great Wall of China and the Egyptian Pyramid Fields.
