Yes we know it maybe raining! We arrive in Rishikesh 12.00 noon Saturday the 22nd of August. We are looking for advice for a way of arranging a trek either privately or as part of a larger group. We must be back in Delhi to catch a plane at 5.00pm on Friday 28th of August. As we see it we have the following options. Option 1 We arrange as much of travel and accommodation ourselves. We get a bus to Joshimath Sunday 23rd of August, stay in Joshimath overnight. Bus or car to Govind Ghat early next day, Monday 24th August. Hire a guide to take us to Ghangaria, camp in Ghangaria for one night. Then next day guide to take us into the Valley of Flowers and around the area. Stay in Ghangaria for another night, 25th August. Next day guide to take us back down to Govind Ghat, where we can get the bus back to Joshimath, where we plan to stay another night. Or Option 2 Treking operator meets us at Joshimath. Start trek early Monday morning 24th of August. Operator arranges travel, guide, accommodation and food etc. With our itinerary we need to be back to catch a train to Delhi from Hardiwar 6.00am 28th August. We are looking to keep the budget to a reasonable amount as we have to make a little go a long way. Any help or advise with this would be greatly appreciated, we are looking for an experience tour guide who speaks English.
