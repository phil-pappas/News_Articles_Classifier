Encouraging visitors to absorb the spirit of Quito and understand more about its culture, cuisine and heritage, Casa Gangotena is now pleased to offer hotel guests complimentary access to a series of carefully themed daily adventures set to take place every evening from 6pm. \nFor the body – Guests will be able to share in the magic of pre-Hispanic culture with a demonstration of ‘limpias’ – traditional Ecuadorian body and spirit cleansing rituals. This will take place every Monday evening and is conducted by Rosa Lagla, one of Quito’s most well regarded traditional therapy practitioners. For foodies – A Tuesday night chocolate tasting offers the chance to learn about Ecuador’s most famous export. It was originally thought that the Cacao tree came from Central America, but it has now been proven to originate from the Ecuadorian Amazon – as such Ecuadorian chocolate is considered by many to be the finest in the world. Sunday’s activity is short and tasty with a half an hour demonstration about the local herbs and flowers which are used by the hotel’s F&B team to create the signature ‘Agua de Frescos’, a refreshing, non-alcoholic drink made with sugar, lemon juice and herbs including mint, basil, verbena and amaranth flowers. For history lovers – Each Wednesday night, guests can gain a fascinating insight into the heritage of the 500 year old San Francisco Plaza and its monastery, with an hour long lecture enjoyed (cocktail in hand) from the hotel’s beautiful panoramic terrace which has a bird’s eye view of the site. Saturday evenings offer a narrated tour to those interested in the heritage of the hotel itself. The mansion building has a colourful past and was historically the residence for several presidents during the late nineteenth century. Rebuilt in 1926 following a fire, it was designated a ‘heritage property’ soon after Quito was nominated as UNESCO’s first World Heritage Site in 1978. For culture vultures - The ‘El Alabado After Hours’ experience will give guests exclusive evening access to the El Alabado Museum each Thursday. This museum houses one of Ecuador’s most impressive archaeological collections and is located only a stone’s throw from the hotel. Perfect for those wanting to know more about the rest of Quito’s centre is the 45 minute walking tour which will take place every Sunday evening. This promises a snapshot into the city’s past and present, guiding guests on foot from the Plaza Grande to Plaza San Francisco, passing some of the capital’s most important historic buildings along the way. The new Casa Gangotena Quito Experiences take place daily at 6pm and are free of charge for hotel guests. Casa Gangotena rates from $460 per night on a B&B basis.
