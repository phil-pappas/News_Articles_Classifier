Obvious.\nSouth-East Asia look out, the Daddos are coming!\nFour countries in three weeks was the plan; barely enough time for temple fatigue, but opportunities for hair braiding, lolling in turquoise waters, exotic food and good, old-fashioned shopping.\nIt’s a reasonable effort to get from Sydney to Northern Thailand’s most “culturally significant” city of Chiang Mai, but certainly worth the effort. Our three kids range from 16 down to 11, so they’re able to look after themselves on a plane, but it still helped to have a stash of books for take-off, landing and in-flight entertainment catastrophes.\nWhether it was brilliant planning or a happy accident, to arrive in Chiang Mai at night was the perfect antidote to the long flight. Fireworks, a sky full of lanterns and lots of noise seemed to set up our adventure.\nA Chiang Mai sky full of lanterns set up the Daddo family adventure.

Smart travellers would have googled an itinerary, researched it, and possibly post-it noted the school bulletin board for tips and advice. We would have, of course, but sometimes life gets in the way of holidays.\nBesides, the concierge had a “cousin with a van” who knew exactly what we wanted.\nHe looked like Elvis, spoke fluent “Thaiglish” and had us pegged at “Ciao Ossies”. Elephants, zip-lines, tigers, free lunch and a temple or two for good measure made for the greatest, most exhausting first day ever. After dinner in the old town we lit lanterns and sent them skyward – for blessings and thanks and future fabulousness. We looked again for trip advice on the day and were thankful we hadn’t done it before heading out. Not everyone sees the same thing the same way; what’s boring or stupid or vacuous to some travellers is the stuff of legend to others.\nWe were keen to sip from the vast cup of Chiang Mai culture and a half day of “tempting” was close to enough – for all of us – though Jac and I made a good show of wanting more. We found that sampling street food between temples was a great diversion and were encouraged by the adventurous palate of two of our three kids. Turns out deep-fried crickets aren’t as bad as they look.\nLanna countryside tour by bike outside Chiang Mai. Picture: SpiceRoads Source: Supplied\nTravel’s about trying something different, so we booked a guide through Spice Roads Travel and did a cycling tour of rural Chiang Mai. We’re not big guide getters, but Noom was a revelation. Fluent, informed and incredibly friendly, the day of riding through rice fields, stopping at local markets, silversmiths, temples and ending at a mineral hot springs seemed short on time (but long in the butt).\nDid the girls buy too many pairs of low-slung gypsy pants in Chiang Mai? Do I wish I hadn’t let someone paint a touristy elephant on my beautiful leather wallet? Probably, but why not, it’s a holiday to remember, right?\nFoodwise, we smashed everything – particularly the street food – but we also chanced our tastes on local restaurants as opposed to eating Western food, with excellent results. “Spicy” does mean hot, though.\nFor planning reasons that were never really explained to me, we were going from Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang in Laos. Maybe because it sounded exotic, but possibly as a travelling test as well, as there is no easy way to do it. If you fly, you eventually face a long, mountainous bus ride. If you bus – well, you’re in a bus for 14 hours. In the end we opted for a slow boat down the Mekong.\nWe had a fun day’s drive from Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong, stopping at Wat Rong Khun, otherwise known as the White Temple (it has the best public toilets in Thailand). We also boiled eggs in a hot spring and saw the Golden Triangle, where Laos, Thailand and Burma come together.\nIt was our first look at the Mekong and made me nervous. “Slow-boat?” Really? There isn’t a fast boat? Three kids on an old, wooden drawn-out junkish- looking thing for two days with up to 40 other people? Eating street food is part of the fun. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nIn Chiang Khong, a modest launching pad for tourists up or down the Mekong, while the others loaded up with obscure beer T-shirts and more low-crutched gypsy pants, I searched for an insurance policy, finding it in a small wooden box. It was a game called Nine Men’s Morris and became a hit on board. It’s also the only place I saw barbecued rat on the whole trip.\nThere’s a fair bit of chatter online about the slow boats down the Mekong, but the best advice we could work out was to take snacks and things to do that do not require power.\nRelaxed would be best describe the two days, though I will admit to being thankful for paying a little extra and going with a private operator. There were 20 people on our boat. The public boat, which runs exactly the same route at much the same time, was packed with a combination of locals and well-watered, stumbling backpackers.\nExotic, utterly extravagant in its beauty and a cultural goldmine, Luang Prabang is a UNESCO World Heritage city. At dawn each day, hundreds of local monks walk the main street for alms, creating an interesting mix of beauty, tourism and local commerce.\nSurprisingly enough, Kuang Si Falls was the highlight in Luang Prabang. It’s not that there was anything wrong with the Old Quarter, the Royal Palace, the cooking classes or the night market, it’s just that the falls were so surprising.\nThe tuktuk ride there was as good as any roller-coaster, the swimming hole was stunning and the fabulously non-OH&S walk to the top of the falls was exotically dangerous.\nThere’s also a bear sanctuary to visit and a surprisingly beautiful butterfly garden for the trip home.\nThere’s a reason every single tourist makes it up Mt Phu Si, for sunsets. At 100m it’s not terribly high, but as the home to numerous temples and stunning views across the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers, it’s definitely spectacular.
