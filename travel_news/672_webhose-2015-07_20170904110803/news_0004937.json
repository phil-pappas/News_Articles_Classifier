It’s quite easy to just focus on footy because one slip-up and it could really cost us at the end of the season.”\nDangerfield admitted he was still attracted by the lure of reuniting with his family in Moggs Creek in Victoria but said he also had strong emotional ties to West Lakes.\n“It’s one family over another almost. That’s what the Adelaide footy club has become over the last eight years,” he said.\n“My feeling towards the club hasn’t changed, I still love the place. But I just haven’t made the decision yet because it just hasn’t been of huge importance to me, basically.”\nThe Pulse has this story today as well as other breaking news and all your traffic and weather updates.\nSo stay with us, we’re blogging live until 10am.
