Picture by Chris Pavlich\nThis is the second Frozen doll to be released. The first, released last year, was Snowflake Elsa but the new doll’s novelty is that she sings the whole song Let It Go and also has a karaoke feature that enables children to sing along.\nIt has been awarded the Australian Girls Toy of the Year for 2015 but she is not cheap, presently selling at Target for $79.\nMr Hunter said the technology is different to anything seen previously. The technology also explains the delay in her arrival and relatively small number of dolls arriving in the first shipment.\n“There are 30,000 here now but more will be coming every week now,” he said.\n“We sold 55,000 of the first doll last year so we understand the demand. We anticipate selling 2 million dolls worldwide.”\nElly Oh sings Let It Go 0:30 Play video Elly Oh belted out Demi Lovato's Disney tune from Frozen.
