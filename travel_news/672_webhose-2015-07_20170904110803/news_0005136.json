Marketeers, policy makers and cultural commentators may still be as obsessed with this generation – born between 1980 and 2000 (depending on who you ask) – as they seem to be with themselves. But now the oldest members are turning 35, there’s a whole new cohort coming of age: Generation Z . While their predecessors were children of the peaceful, prosperous 1990s - who saw their bright futures snatched away by the rude awakening of 9/11 and the recession - the oldest Gen Z-ers were only hitting their teens when credit crunched, meaning they have grown up under no illusions that anyone else is going to help them make their way. Chloe Combi, a former school teacher and consultant on youth issues for the Mayor of London, who interviewed hundreds of teenagers and young adults for her new book, Generation Z , defines them as those born between 1995 and 2001 – a subset of Generation Y, really, but a distinct one, whose dates coincide with the spread of home internet connections and mobile phones. “Those two things birthed a different world, which is the world this generation was born into,” says Combi. This “iGeneration” can’t conceive of a world before everyone owned a mobile phone and would laugh if you told them there only used to be four channels on TV, or that you used to have to hand over pocket money in a record shop if you wanted to listen to an album (on an antiquated disc known as a CD). Instant gratification is their norm; whether they want information, entertainment or pornography, they can have it in the palms of their hands within moments, usually for free. This “iGeneration” can’t conceive of a world before everyone owned a mobile phone This ability to find whatever they’re after without the help of intermediaries – such as libraries, shops or teachers - has made them more independent and self-directed than generations before them, but more impatient, too. A recent American study put the average attention span in 2015 at 8.25 seconds – officially less than a goldfish, which comes in at 9 seconds. Five years is a significantly shorter period with which to define a generation than those that came before them: Generations X (early 1960s to early 1980s) and Y (1980-2000). “Things have changed so much faster in recent years than they did in the past,” says Combi, describing how differences profound enough to be considered “generational” have piled up at head-spinning speed. Generation Z have known uncertainty all their lives: parents losing their jobs, family homes sold from under their feet, war and social unrest across the globe. They know that nothing can be taken for granted, are keenly aware of the West’s changing fortunes and eager to make their own way in the world. So, with the oldest soon set to graduate, what can we expect from the newest generation to hit the workforce? Gen Z: the good Growing up on decidedly shaky economic ground seems to have nurtured a distinctly entrepreneurial spirit. Earlier this year, the Generation Z Conference was held at American University in Washington DC with the aim of harnessing exactly this drive. It was attended by the likes of 16-year-old Sejal Makheja, who founded a vocational training organization that aims to lift people out of poverty when she was just 14. Unlike the rather more entitled Generation Y (also dubbed Generation Whine), their innate pessimism – “there are no jobs and everything is getting worse,” makes some feel that hard work is a mugs game, but for others has been channelled into a pragmatic acceptance that they’re going to have to create opportunities for themselves. “They have an instinctive understanding of technology, which the brightest among them is applying to the big issues of our times: healthcare, energy, education,” Combi says. “These kids will create new jobs and industry.” And they’re nothing if not diverse. “One of the best aspects of this generation is the multiplicity of identities,” says Combi. “They tend to be totally cool about homosexuality and mixed-race couples; transgender is something they’re increasingly comfortable with. They could become much more open-minded bosses who are less discriminatory in their hiring than generations past.” \"They tend to be totally cool about homosexuality and mixed-race couples; transgender is something they’re increasingly comfortable with\" This open-minded flexibility extends into every sphere: “They see formerly deeply-gendered jobs such as doctors, personal assistants and bus drivers as much more gender neutral,” says Combi. ”And boys are much more into family life than men of previous generations. They take it for granted that they’ll do housework, cook, shop and be actively engaged fathers. Many of the boys I spoke to found it quite shocking that earlier generations of men didn’t change nappies or spend much time with their children.” They’re unlikely to take on the problem drinker mantle from their parents, either. While one in three of over-45s regularly drink more than the recommended weekly limit, research published by the Demos thinktank showed one in five 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal . Gen Z: the bad Combi interviewed a broad range of Gen Z-ers , from titled Etonians to teenagers on their second (or third) stint in the Young Offenders Institute. They all agreed on two things: “there is too much focus on sex”, as 16-year-old Minnie in Hampshire put it; and, says Combi, “girls have it harder now”. Joni, 17, told her, “on the internet, girls aren’t just insulted for their looks, they’re called ugly whores and told to get gang-raped and die”. According to Michael, 18, in west London, “rape jokes, violent porn and misogynistic language” are part of a normal day. “Sexual politics have taken a massive step backwards in the bedroom, with girls encouraged to be passive and boys aggressive,” explains Combi. “They’re almost certainly imitating what they see in pornography. An increase in sexual assault is a real possibility as is harassment at work, which is why good sex education is critical if we want to avoid the bad old days of 1960s sexist attitudes returning to the boardroom.” Far fewer see further education as a viable route to their future, the essential professions – doctor, lawyer, vet – may soon find themselves falling out of fashion That’s if Gen Z’ers have any interest in entering the boardroom in the first place. “Rampant celebrity culture is fuelling unrealistic expectations,” says Combi. “Gen Z has grown up with reality TV stars, social media celebrities and world-famous twenty-something billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg .” While many may be X inspired by those who have made themselves into something out of nothing, Combi worries: “Some genuinely expect to achieve these wild dreams without hard work and with no plan B.” And with spiralling university fees meaning far fewer see further education as a viable route to their future, the essential professions – doctor, lawyer, vet – may soon find themselves falling out of fashion. Gen Z: the unexpected “Class has re-emerged as an issue,” Combi says. “Perhaps because wealth inequality has become more marked in their lifetimes. I met a lot of high-achieving state-educated kids who weren’t applying to red-brick universities because they felt they wouldn’t fit in. There’s a real sense of injustice, but instead of being angry and productive, a lot of them are just giving up.” Perhaps they can’t be blamed. A five-year study of disadvantaged teenagers by researchers at Northwestern University in the US concluded that youngsters from low-income families who succeed academically and socially, pay the price with their health. Far from bringing wealth, prosperity and a better standard of living, the stress of climbing the social ladder seems to speed up ageing by damaging DNA, with no promise of financial reward. Little wonder many set less store by economic achievement as a measure of success. “They give a lot of importance to what you might call emotional achievements,” says Combi. ”They’re very aware that there’s no certainty with regards to jobs, financial security or buying a house , and so they value personal satisfaction more highly than material success.”This personal satisfaction is both reflected and refracted by their carefully cultivated social media feeds: “They have strikingly low self-esteem, thanks to being constantly exposed to peers relentlessly flaunting heavily edited, perfected versions of their lives,” Combi says. “They can’t help comparing themselves.” But if there’s no chance of getting them offline , at least this, too, has its benefits. “On the other hand, social media and online video games have allowed them to communicate with people from dozens of different countries since they could hold a smartphone,” says Combi. “They know there’s a big world out there - and it will be up to them to find their way in it.” So, what’s the future for Gen Z? Well, if millennials were distressed not to meet their parents’ metrics of success – from property ownership to secure, well-paid jobs – this lot seem more likely to eschew them (along with other once-traditional rites of passage) altogether. While every successive generation gets a bad rap from those that have gone before, this one may well prove better than most at playing the hand they've been dealt.
