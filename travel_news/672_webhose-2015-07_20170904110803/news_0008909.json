The town wants Vail Resorts to help fund a town-wide transit plan that would build parking garages, and make road and pedestrian improvements, at a cost of annually of between $4 million-$6 million, the Denver Post reported, adding that the tax would add about $6 to a $149 lift ticket. Breckenridge city leaders say that the town of Vail has been charging a lift-ticket tax for nearly 50 years and it's only fair that the Broomfield-based resort company (NYSE: MTN) do the same in Breckenridge. But Vail Resorts doesn't see it that way, and said it was willing to help fund a parking garage, but opposed the tax plan. \"It is clear that the town is solely focused on increasing their tax revenue, rather than on solving problems. We are very disappointed that the town has refused our offer of private funding and instead are rushing ahead to tax all Breckenridge skiers and snowboarders,\" the company said in a statement . The Summit Daily News reported that Breckenridge residents will vote on the lift-ticket tax plan in November.
