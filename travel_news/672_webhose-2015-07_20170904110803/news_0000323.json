In fact, board games of the 80s and 90s have gone virtually extinct, collecting dust in our closets and nostalgia in our hearts. Luckily, a global trend has found a use for them: board game cafés. \nScattered around the globe, board game cafés are popping up as a remedy for technology fatigue. Jia Han, a millennial and web addict told Independent Magazine , “You get excited when you first play online games. But you feel tired and bored after a while because you don’t know the players on the other side of the screen.” \nBusinesses like the esteemed Snakes and Lattes in Toronto, The Brooklyn Strategist in New York, Board Game Island in Texas and Cacacity in Taiwan bring millennials together with their favorite board games. Game options range from: traditional chess and checkers to more modern board games like Hedbanz and Cards Against Humanity. No matter your preference–there’s a game for that. \nHere in the Boston area, Millenials are just as susceptible to boredom and lack of social contact. Eager to catch up with the nostalgic trend, the Knight Moves Café has nestled itself into the suburban streets of Brookline, aiming to be one of the greatest board game cafes in the country. Owner Devon Trevelyan, a millennial, established the café in 2013. A proactive businessman, he became passionate about business at the ripe age of eight after selling flavored ice to college students . Knight Moves Café was started as an indie business that aimed to bring together the community through coffee and old fashioned board game fun. \nLike its familiar counterparts, the café holds hundreds of board games —nearly 1,000 to be precise. Staff members, also known as board game experts, are available for board game expertise and the café is open late hours. With access to all games, the standard entrance fee is $10 except on slower days, Monday through Wednesday, when admission is only $5. For avid game players, a monthly membership can be bought for $40, a bargain that includes unlimited access to the game cupboard with only the flash of a membership card. Great for a good cup of coffee and your next Friday night board game, this café is now a favorite among the Brookline locals. \nInterested in supporting the indie business?
