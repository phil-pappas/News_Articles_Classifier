The airline is the first in America and the third in the world to receive this certification, which was awarded during IATA’s last Annual General Meeting in Miami.\nIEnvA is an innovative environmental management system for flight operations and corporate activities specifically developed for the airline industry. LATAM Airlines Group, together with other airlines, has been working with IATA over the last three years to develop the system. “The objective of IEnvA, similar to IOSA[ii] but focused on environmental topics, is to improve the environmental management and performance of airlines around the world,” said Enrique Guzmán, Senior Environmental Manager at LAN.\nTony Tyler, Director General and CEO of IATA, delivered the recognition to Roberto Alvo, Senior VP of Network & Fleet of LATAM Airlines Group during the 2015 IATA AGM in Miami, in the United States. “Achieving this certification is an important step for our company. This was only possible thanks to the support of all the areas of the company. It is proof of our dedication to combat climate change and to being one of the leading airline groups that cares about the environment,” said Roberto Alvo.\nTony Tyler added, ”I congratulate LATAM Airlines Group for obtaining the IEnvA certification for its international flights operating from Chile. The continuous improvement in environmental performance is essential for the aviation industry, and LATAM Airlines Group has demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by implementing this system.”\nIEnvA will allow LATAM Airlines Group to achieve the ambitious goals it has set in the environmental area, including:\n· IATA objective 1: improve fuel use efficiency. · IATA Objective 2: Carbon Neutral growth in 2020. · IATA Objective 3: by 2050, achieve a 50% reduction in net CO 2 emissions from 2005 levels. · Carbon Neutral Ground Operations in 2020. · A 10% improvement in energy efficiency in the company’s infrastructure by 2020. · Savings of USD$200,000 in energy consumption by facilities in 2020. · A 10% decrease in waste volume in 2020.\nSource:- LATAM Airlines\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
