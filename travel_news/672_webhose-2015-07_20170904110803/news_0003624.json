The report discusses BaFin’s investigation of the bank’s manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and other market benchmarks and how, less than one month later, the bank’s co-CEOs, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, announced they planned to resign. At that time Deutsche Bank officials said the resignations weren’t the result of regulatory pressure. However, the report accused a half-dozen current Deutsche Bank DB, -0.81% executives of failing to stop or tell regulators about years of attempted market manipulation. The regulators criticize what they say is a broken corporate culture at the bank. Frauke Menke, the German financial watchdog’s top supervisor of large banks, said in the report: “It appears to me that this is a manifestation of [a] culture that is possibly still characteristic to your bank, i.e. to prefer hiding, covering up or entirely negating problems instead of addressing them openly and actively in order to prevent similar issues in the future.”\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission published new rules to the Federal Register on Wednesday for Freedom of Information Act requests to its office. The commission will collect fees that now reflect its actual cost. Requesters would now be charged in quarter-hour increments for research time, and the first half-hour is no longer free. The rule adds an appeals time frame. The SEC will also now be allowed to issue responses to FOIA requests indicating that no records were located. The final rule is effective Aug. 14.\nMartin Wheatley has resigned as CEO of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority after being told by Chancellor George Osborne that his contract would not be renewed when it expires in March, according to the Financial Times on Friday. He will leave the job in September but stay on as an adviser until January. The FCA imposed record penalties during Wheatley’s two-year tenure, especially on banking, by teaming with U.S. authorities in probing the Libor and foreign-exchange benchmark-rigging scandals. The FCA also fined retail banks for misselling products to consumers. The authority last week announced it would not take action against Bruno Iksil, the “London Whale” trader. J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -0.63% did pay $920 million to several agencies in the United States and Britain over its failure to prevent its traders from fraudulently overvaluing investments due to a lack of internal controls and poor supervision.\nOsborne, however, was peeved at Wheatley ever since what the Financial Times calls a “botched press briefing” in 2013 that resulted in significant share-price drops among the U.K.’s major insurers when investors responded to the mistaken message that certain annuity products would be targeted by the regulator. The chairman of the FCA, John Griffith-Jones, who accepted Wheatley’s resignation, is also facing resignation calls due to his former job as chairman of the accounting firm KPMG, auditor of failed bank HBOS.\nThe U. S. Treasury Department issued a Request for Information seeking public comment about the fast-growing online lending marketplaces. Treasury wants to understand “the various business models of and products offered by online marketplace lenders to small businesses and consumers, the potential for online marketplace lending to expand access to credit to historically underserved market segments, and how the financial regulatory framework should evolve to support the safe growth of this industry.” Although that might sound like the first step toward a contemplation of skin-in-the-game regulations for these lenders, a Treasury spokesman said in response to a MarketWatch story about its request that Treasury is not a regulator and that this is not a first step by a regulator or a regulatory action. Rather, it’s a chance for Treasury to hear “success stories” and more about potential public-policy issues and solutions.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Documents/RFI%20Online%20Marketplace%20Lending.pdf", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-blasts-deutsche-bank-executives-over-broken-culture-1437068759", "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/10/hbos-heat-on-city-regulator-fca", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/61f867fa-2c76-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html#ixzz3g9QN4CUD", "http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2015-07-15/pdf/2015-17179.pdf", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/0b2a8b4c-8064-11e4-872b-00144feabdc0.html#"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T19:07:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
