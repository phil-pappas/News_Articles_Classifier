As most travellers will purchase air tickets from the AirAsia website, we will offer ground packages which can also be tailor-made.” \n\nAccording to Spencer Lee, head of commercial at AirAsia, the flight schedule for the Kuala Lumpur-Maldives route allows travellers from other countries such as South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Australia to connect easily via the carrier's Fly-Thru service. \n\nDestinations which offers Fly-Thru connectivity to the Maldives include Incheon, Osaka, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Bangkok, Penang and Gold Coast, he added. \n\nOnline booking at airasia.com has begun with all-inclusive fares starting from RM169 (US$44.60) for travel periods from October 22, 2015 to August 31, 2016.
