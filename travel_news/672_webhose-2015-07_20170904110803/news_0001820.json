The 45-year-old architect recently received a phone call from her matchmaker, Rachael Chan, to ask why she had missed a dinner date with a 55-year-old property company executive. As usual, the answer had been work. Instead of meeting with a potential partner, Miss Lee had been busy finalising a project in Japan. The date had not even crossed her mind until she received a reminder on her smartphone through WhatsApp, the instant messaging app. It was the third time in a row Ms Chan had been forced to call a client and apologise for Lee’s no-show. “Career ladies at the executive level are often too oriented toward professional goals, and that doesn’t help them in developing a relationship,” said Chan, co-founder of Rachael and Smith Matchmakers. “I could tell Lee was really into (the property executive) ... She asked me to send him a box of chocolates on her behalf.” But it was too late. Miss Lee’s date had already met someone else and was talking about a serious relationship. Ms Chan said the number of women who inquired about her services had tripled since she and a partner launched their business in 2012. Connie Yung has run Date and Match Consultancy for seven years. She said less than a third of her female clients in 2011 were in the middle- to high-income bracket, earning HK$30,000 (£2,500) a month or more. Now they accounted for almost half. High-earning women have anxiety about being “left over”, the translation of the Chinese term used for unmarried people These figures, and other anecdotal evidence, have shown that more career women in Hong Kong have been seeking help from professional matchmakers to find a mate, or even just a companion. Karen Wong is 32 and works in finance. She signed up to a “premium package” with Rachael and Smith Matchmakers, and described the service as similar to that of a corporate headhunter. The chance to meet the right candidate, however, cost her a quarter of her monthly salary. “I don’t have time to date, and even if I do, I can’t guarantee the person I’m seeing is as serious as me,” she said. “Finding a partner is like searching for a needle in a haystack.” Of course, it is not only high-earning women who have anxiety about being “left over”, the translation of the Chinese term used for unmarried people. Hong Kong’s 2011 Census showed 46.8 per cent of the male population aged 20 to 49, and 38.9 per cent or women in the same age range have never tied the knot. In May last year, more than 1,500 people in Hong Kong registered to take part in If You Are The One , the Chinese version of the British TV dating show Take me Out . The turnout was greater than any other Chinese city. Ms Yung at Date and Match said another change to her clientele was the age. In 2008, she said, her company had no women under 30 on the books. Today, she said her client list included women in their early twenties. “It’s a smart move for them to act quickly,” she said, adding that women in their mid-twenties “definitely have an advantage” in the dating scene. Groomed for success The amounts charged by matchmakers in Hong Kong vary depending on the service provided. A basic package, which usually covers three dates, costs about HK$10,000, while a six- month premium package can be between HK$60,000 and HK$100,000. Some companies also offer a relatively cheaper, “passive” membership, which means the person can only go on a date when selected by another client. “I tell my clients, ‘Don’t worry, the service is much cheaper than that Chanel bag you’re going to buy’,” Ms Chan said jokingly. “In the past, when women felt the pressure to settle down, they perhaps compromised and got married in a hurry. Today, they can instead spend money on finding the right partner,” she said, adding that many of her high-income clients had properties, “which gives them a sense of security”. As customers have become more discerning, dating agencies have had to expand their services from merely searching a database for a potential match and booking a table for two. Most premium packages now include not only creating a photo profile, but also coaching for clients on how to behave on a date, and tips on personal grooming. “If you want to get something you never had before, such as finding Mr Right, you have to do things you never did before; maybe go to the gym, get some exercise so you’re in shape and look good,” Ms Chan said. Her standard advice to clients is: moderation is the key. “At a certain age, when hormone levels fall, it really requires more painstaking efforts to stay attractive,” she said. Many of her clients are willing to go that extra mile, too. At her signup interview, Miss Wong was advised to trim her “straggly eyebrows” and change her wardrobe, which she did, trawling the shops of Soho for figure-hugging dresses that highlighted her curves. She also grew out her hair and dyed it brown, as well as got a set of fancy French fingernails. The next time Ms Chan met her she had also lost 10 pounds. Just six months after her makeover, Miss Wong had begun a steady relationship. “A woman under 33 can usually find someone,” Ms Chan said. “But if she’s older, it really depends on the improvements she has made in personal grooming, and the time she is willing to invest in finding a match.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
