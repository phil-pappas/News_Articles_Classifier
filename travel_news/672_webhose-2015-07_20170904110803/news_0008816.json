Kathu is one of the few areas of Phuket which hasn’t yet succumbed to commercialization. It is populated with Chinese-Thai residents who take pride in their history and heritage. Kathu is dotted with their traditional homes and they are more than happy to the ‘real’ Phuket that exists away from the beaches to tourists. You might be able to learn some interesting facts about the tin-mining era that put Kathu on the map, besides other interesting facets of local lifestyle through the ages.\nPrince of Songkla University, Phuket Campus is also joining the folks of Kathu in preserving their unique traditions and customs by preparing a host of traditional and contemporary performances to delight visitors and travellers during the three-day event.\nThe town also features Indian and Malaysian influences, which might be interesting to dig up and explore.For good luck travellers joining the Festival are being invited to join the local people in paying homage to the three sacred shrines in the vicinity.\nFairly nascent as compared to various other cultural and traditional fiestas in Thailand, the Kathu Street Culture Festival is a must-see especially if you’re making a second or third trip to Phuket. The festival is growing in popularity, drawing a larger number of spectators every year.\nSource:- Phuket Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:10:54.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
