Definitely we cannot trust promises,” he added.\nPromises worth nothing ... German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says Greece has destroyed trust “in an incredible way”. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\nMinister after minister insisted on the need to rebuild trust with Athens after six months of torturous debt deal negotiations and a sudden referendum in which Greeks overwhelmingly rejected creditors’ bailout terms.\n“We are not there yet. There is a major issue of trust — can the Greek government be trusted to do what they are promising in coming weeks, months and years?” asked Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem.\nMr Tsipras won the backing of 251 out of 300 deputies for his reform plans, even though they are similar to the ones that Greeks rejected in the referendum after he branded them “humiliating”.\nIssue of trust ... Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem says he is unsure how Greece can be trusted in the years ahead. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\nGreece’s creditors fear it will not keep its promises after two previous bailouts worth 240 billion euros merely heaped fresh debt on a mountain worth nearly 180 per cent of the country’s GDP.\nDespite roundly voting ‘No’ last Sunday to accepting tough austerity terms for a bailout that expired June 30, Greeks are alarmed at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed cash at ATMs for nearly two weeks.\nQueuing on Saturday at a cash machine in Athens, Facials Papoutsoglou, 52, said: “We still don’t know what will happen tomorrow. Can we expect something better, or is it Armageddon?”\nThe Greek government hoped the vote would give it an emphatic mandate to continue the talks with the creditors.\nProtests ...

IMF (International Monetary Fund) chief Christine Lagarde looks on prior to the starting of a Eurogroup finance ministers meeting. Picture: AFP Source: AFP\nIn Brussels there were some more hopeful voices.\nIMF chief Christine Lagarde — who has echoed calls by Athens and the United States for part of Greece’s debt to be eliminated — was more positive, saying she hoped for “a lot of progress”.\nEU sources who asked not to be named put the probability of a deal at no more than 50-50.\nEU President Donald Tusk has said the 28-nation European summit he will host in Brussels on Sunday is a “last chance” for Greece to seal a deal and avoid a disastrous “Grexit”.\nAnd even if the leaders agree a deal, at least eight parliaments will have to weigh in, with Germany’s Bundestag having to vote twice.\nOriginally published as ‘We cannot trust Greek promises’", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/580050-059ffde0-27eb-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/578934-1f3c7d6e-27eb-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/deal-doubtful-as-eurozones-trust-in-greece-erodes/story-e6frfm1i-1227438578960", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/580024-d9e0153c-27ea-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/580078-5ed8365c-27eb-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:08:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
