Covering almost 50,000 square feet, the China Pavilion, which has five main exhibition areas – Introduction, Sky, Earth, Humanity and Harmony – and a model farm, is second in size only to the Germany pavilion. This year marked the first time China has participated in a universal exposition overseas. “It is also the first time China has had two subsidiary pavilions for businesses, the China Corporate United Pavilion and Vanke Pavilion,” Wang said. Vanke, based in the southern city of Shenzhen, is one of the country’s largest property developers. In all, 148 countries, regions and international organisations have taken part in the expo, which is being held at a site about nine miles from downtown Milan. More than 20 million visitors are expected before it closes on October 31. Throughout May, more than 10,000 people a day visited the three Chinese pavilions, according to organisers, who said the restaurant at the China Pavilion was the biggest attraction. Sean Naismith from Manchester said he visited the China Pavilion to understand how China relies on improved seed and farming technologies to feed 20 per cent of the world’s population. “The China Pavilion shows what the country has done in terms of building a global agricultural supply network, applying practical farming methods and technologies, collaborating with international companies to understand the effect of bio-technology step by step, as well as reducing vulnerability to pests and cutting down inflation in food prices,” he said. “After visiting the Israeli pavilion, my first impression is that big countries such as China, India and the United States should introduce more drip irrigation technologies and other natural resource-saving measures to save water, as well as use fewer fertilisers to grow their crops,” he added. “Being big doesn’t mean you don’t have to face the situation of water shortages sooner or later.” After the Milan Expo, officials said the China Pavilion would be relocated to Qingdao, on the east coast of China. The exposition will be an opportunity to consolidate commercial relations between Italy and China 2015 marks the 45th anniversary of the diplomatic relationship between China and Italy, making the expo a prime location for government and business leaders to enhance communication and understanding, said Wang, who is also vice-president of CCPIT, which promotes Chinese international economic interests. Yu Xiaodong, a spokesman for the CCPIT, said the event offered China the opportunity to expand collaboration with European countries and multinationals on modern agriculture, energy efficiency and sustainable urbanisation, and develop better ties in finance and trade as well as people-to-people exchanges. “The exposition will be an opportunity to consolidate commercial relations between Italy and China, and will give China a strategic opportunity to share its own culture, traditions and innovations,” said Giuseppe Sala, commissioner of the Italian government for the expo. “With its three pavilions, China is among those which has invested the most in our event,” he said. “The projects presented...are very high profile, and will offer visitors an edutainment experience rich in content and of extraordinary interest.” A road show to promote the expo travelled through eight Chinese cities between October and March. “I’m sure (the expo) will be a unique opportunity to familiarise Italians and the rest of the world with the history, traditions and innovations of this great country,” Sala said. “China can and wants to make a strategic contribution to the global challenge of sustainable development for the near future.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
