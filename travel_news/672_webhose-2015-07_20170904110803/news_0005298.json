It makes the park a welcome dark place in the densely populated East Coast.\nThe recognition is from the International Dark Sky Places Association, which advocates for the protection of night skies.\nStaunton River State Park promotes a star party each year. More than 140 visitors attended last year's event at the Southside park.\nThe Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation says Staunton River State Park is the first state park in Virginia to be recognized by the association.\n___\nOnline\"\nInternational Dark Sky Places: http://www.darksky.org\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:09:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
