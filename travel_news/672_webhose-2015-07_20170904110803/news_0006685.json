(John Lok / The Seattle Times) By Brian J. Cantwell Seattle Times travel writer \nNeed to escape the sweltering city, which as of late has felt a bit like the SURFACE OF THE SUN ? Here are three getaways for this weekend that feature marine-air breezes or alpine coolness. \n1. Not only can you sip (and take home) some of Washington’s best vino, but you can ride the Crystal Mountain gondola to the tippy top and breathe fresh mountain air during the Mount Rainier Wine Festival at Crystal Mountain Resort on Saturday, July 11. About 20 Northwest wineries will set up tasting booths on the lawn at Alpine Inn, along with live jazz. $40 includes eight tasting tickets, wine glass, appetizers and raffle ticket. 2-7 p.m. July 11. Gondola rides, $15-$25 A ferry heads for the dock at Friday Harbor, site of this weekend’s San Juan Island Summer Arts Fair. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times) \n2. It’s San Juan Island Summer Arts Fair weekend in Friday Harbor. Local and regional artists will show and sell their best in 50 booths along Court Street. Local musicians, food booths, a Kids Creative Center and fun with sidewalk chalk art round out the weekend. While you’re in an arty mood, stop by the new San Juan Islands Museum of Art . Hop a ferry and catch marine breezes along the way (go as a walk-on for a day trip, or ride a bike, and no ferry reservations are needed). 10 a.m.-5 p.m. July 11-12, by the San Juan County Courthouse. Free. Cape Disappointment Lighthouse, as seen from Waikiki Beach, said to be named for shipwrecked sailors from Hawaii. (Greg Gilbert/The Seattle Times) \n3. Make tracks (in the sand) to Waikiki Beach — not the hot and sweaty one in Hawaii, the Northwest marine-air-cooled one at Cape Disappointment State Park , at the mouth of the Columbia River near Ilwaco. Saturday brings another installment of the Waikiki Beach Concert Series , with rock ‘n’ roll by The Quick & Easy Boys , out of Portland. 7-8:30 p.m., Waikiki Beach Amphitheatre, Cape Disappointment State Park; free concert, Discover Pass required.
