Jean-Pol GRANDMONT \nMons is a city of 90,000 people near the Belgian border with France. A hilltop town surrounded by forest, Mons is known for its rich and varied mix of architectural styles and winding, narrow streets. Victor Hugo fell in love with those \"fantastical buildings\" during a walk with his mistress at midnight in 1837. Perhaps you will, too. \nAnd there's a bonus: stroke the tail of the monkey perched on the left side of the entrance to the town hall with your left hand and you'll enjoy good luck--or so they say. Culture and Museums \nMons has been selected to be the European Capital of Culture for 2015 , and has been working to open 5 museums simultaneously. The building hasn't gone entirely smoothly; see: Mons: it's the European capital of culture – but locals just want to go to Ikea \nThe Artotheque is the new art and history museum they've shoehorned into the chapel of a former Ursulines convent. You'll see a Neolithic materials side by side with contemporary pieces, a historical combination you don't see every day. \nThe Belfry isn't new, but has been renovated--and you can learn of its construction in the new interpretation center. The 17th century bell tower is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the only Baroque belfry in Belgium. According to the tourist bureau: \"All the latest technology has been used, creating unique experiences like bell-ringing concerts in real time. Music lovers will appreciate the opportunity to climb the stairs up to the bells. Last but not least, above and beyond its architectural value, the panoramic views alone are well worth the effort. From the top, you can see the Borinage, the plains of the Haine, even Brussels when the skies are clear, or the French border. \" \nThe Mons Memorial Museum explores the not only the history of war along the Belgian front, but also the men and women whose lives were changed because of it. \nThe Doudou Museum explains the shared cultural spirit of Mons. The Doudou on Trinity weekend celebrates St. George's defeat of the dragon, a UNESCO World Heritage Event. \nThe Silex Interpretation Center represents and explains an ancient source of flint mined during the Neolithic era, currently claimed to be the one of the oldest flint mines in the world. The mine and museum is in the town of Spiennes, six kilometers from Mons. \nAnd finally, a couple of Belgians created the internet. Well, not really the internet of carrying information through monopolistic controlled clogged pipes to home computers, but the \"paper\" internet. The Mundaneum was the visionary brainchild of Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine who, from 1895, aimed to collect and index all knowledge! Archives centre and exhibition space designed by François Schuiten and Benoit Peeters, the Mundaneum preserves a precious documentary heritage, about basically everything.\" ~ Mapping knowledge Mons: Artists and Castles \nMons, like other cities, has its share of street artists . But none other than Vincent Van Gogh came to the slagheaps of Borinage, the industrial mining region surrounding Mons, as an amateur painter and preacher. You'll be able to learn all about him and his meanders through the artistic and spiritual life through various cultural programs in 2015. The Independent has a nice article on the painter: Van Gogh's Borinage: Follow the painter's footsteps in Belgium . You can visit VanGogh's house in Cuesmes, a suburb of Mons. \nLots of art is to be found in the outlying Beloeil Castle, Chateau de Beloeil , which hosts a number of events celebrating the flowers in its Gardens as well as a renowned classical music festival . Unfortunately (if you have arrived by train) you need a car to get to the Chateau, which is between Mons and Ath.
