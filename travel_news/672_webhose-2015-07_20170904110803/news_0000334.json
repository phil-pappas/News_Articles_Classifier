Despite estimated costs outweighing the benefits, Mr Jennings said it was hard to qualify without trying it.\n“You cannot estimate what the potential of economical activity may be or the value of families coming together until we live it,” Mr Jennings told reporters on Wednesday.\nThe day would not only boost tourism in Melbourne, it could have benefits across the state, he said.\nBoth public holidays were Labor’s pre-election promises, and the government will make them official once the public consultation period ends in 28 days.\nOpposition spokesman for jobs, Craig Ondarchie, said the RIS report showed introducing the extra days off was reckless.\nBut he stopped short of promising to reverse the decision if his party won the next election.\n“It is economic vandalism, so (Premier) Daniel Andrews can have another day off,” he told reporters.\nVictorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief Mark Stone said that on Grand Final Friday alone, Victorian businesses could face a $543 million bill to pay full time workers not to work.\nHe said the two new holidays would widen the disparity between public holiday arrangements across Australia.\nVictorian Trades Hall Council was pleased, saying hardworking people need time off now and then.\n“Victoria is not just an economy, we are also a society,” VTHC secretary Luke Hilakari said.\nOriginally published as Move here if you want more holidays", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/victorians-set-to-get-two-new-public-holidays/story-e6frfm9r-1227435280570"], "published": "2015-07-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T07:31:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
