Defense Line of Amsterdam \nThe Defense Line of Amsterdam was conceived as an enormous tract of land that could be flooded to form a defensive moat all around the capital area. The 45 forts that once punctuated the defense line are now out of (military) service, but some of them - chiefly in the North Holland towns of Weesp and Muiden, as well as Pampus Island - are now much-frequented tourist attractions, thanks in part to their historical value and UNESCO status, and especially fun for day trips out with the kids. Click the link for tips on how to visit the various sites that comprise the Defense Line of Amsterdam. More » 3. Beemster Polder \nThe Beemster Polder was a milestone of land reclamation in the Netherlands; drained in 1612, it's constituted some 18,000 acres of dry land ever since. (Learn more about what a polder is.) The country landscape it contains was meticulously planned as a rational patchwork of farms and fields, interlaced with roads and waterways. The typical farm of the polder is the stolpboerderij , or bell-jar farm, which features a pyramidal roof; other architectural sites of interest include the five forts that comprise the Defense Line of Amsterdam (above). \nVisitors can take a self-paced bicycle tour in the open country with the Beemster Route (in Dutch, but the downloadable map is clear to follow!), which takes in the beauty of the countryside, from farms and windmills to meadows, and passes all five forts on the way. 4. D.F. Wouda Steam Pumping Station (D.F. Woudagemaal) \nLocated in Lemmer, province of Friesland, the Wouda Pumping Station is another testament to the Dutch ability to tame the waters that shape their country. The immense pumping station was opened in 1920 in order to pump excess water from the province of Friesland; a milestone of hydraulic engineering, the system consists not only of the station and its boiler house, chimney and coal storage depot, but also the planned landscape of waterways and pasture lands that surround it. Despite its location in the far north, it's also a fine example of the early 20th-century Amsterdam School of architecture. \nThe Wouda Pumping Station has a Visitor Center open each year from February to December. Note that this is one tripfor which I'd be tempted to rent a car: due to poor transit connections, it takes three hours to reach the site: the Intercity train from Amsterdam Central Station to Lelystad, then bus 140 to Emmelord; from the Emmelord bus depot, take bus 77 to Lemmer. From Bus Station Lemmer, visitors can take another bus (line 47 to the Lemsterhoek stop, a 20-minute distance from the site) or take the 45-minute walk to the site.

Mill Network at Kinderdijk-Elshout \nLocated 15 miles east of Rotterdam, the Kinderdijk windmills were erected in the 1600s to drain the Alblasserwaard polders, which had suffered floods since the 13th century. Nowadays the windmills have been relieved by more efficient screw pumps, but you can still visit the monumental 17th-century windmills that comprise the incredible man-made landscape. \nThe windmills can best be seen via a self-paced pedestrian or bicycle tour; route plans are available on the Kinderdijk web site. Views of the landscape, of course, are free and accessible all year round; seasonal hours and admission fees apply only to the public windmill (Windmill 2) and special tours, such as the scenic canal tour that passes each of the 19 mills. See the title link for more information. More » 6. Rietveld Schröder House \nThe UNESCO description fashions the Rietveld Schröder House an \" an icon of the Modern Movement in architecture\", one of the purest expressions of De Stijl, a seminal art movement of the 20th century that emphasized primitives of form and color. This philosophy is clear in the architecture of the house, located in the city of Utrecht , where the artist Gerrit Rietveld was born and lived. While the house was built for Truus Schröder-Schräder, Rietveld kept a studio there, and later spent his last years in the house he masterminded. \nThe Rietveld-Schröder House is now a museum, part of the Centraal Museum Utrecht, and is open to the public. There are several direct trains per hour from Amsterdam Central Station to Utrecht Central Station (CS). From Utrecht CS, take bus line 8 (direction: Wilhelminapark) to De Hoogstraat. More » 7. Schokland and Vicinity \nInhabited since prehistoric times, Schokland was a peninsula until the 15th century; as the sea encroached, however, it first became an island, then had to be evaculated as the Zuider Zee overtook it. When the Zuider Zee was drained in the 1940s to form a new polder, the Noordoostpolder, Schokland was reclaimed; the outlines of the former island territory were, and still are, clear to see amid the wider polder. The remains of the prehistoric island society are also evident, and constitute several protected archaeological sites on the reclaimed land, from terps (artificial hills built for habitation) to prehistoric settlements, plus later structures that were left over from before the island's evacuation. \nSchokland covers a substantial area and there are many ways to see it: walk or cycle the island, follow an expert-led tour, visit its museum and other sites both cultural and natural, and more. See the VVV Noordoostpolder (Tourist Info) site for a list of possibilities. 8. Van Nelle Factory (Van Nellefabriek) \nThe Van Nelle Factory, located on the Schie River in Rotterdam , is a visionary factory - or rather a series of factories - that represents the ideal workplace of its time, the 1920s: an airy, open space for the workers who processed food products and other commodities - coffee, tea, tobacco - from the raw materials imported from the tropics. The factory showa both a sensitivity to the industrial workflow as well as to the outside environment, and in the words of the UNESCO description is considered an icon of 20th-century industrial architecture. \nThe Chabot Museum, Rotterdam, conducts tours of the Van Nelle Factory for interested visitors; contact the museum or see the Chabot Museum web site for further information. 9. Wadden Sea (Waddenzee) \nThe Wadden Sea is the only natural site in the Netherlands to have secured UNESCO status, and one that the country shares with Germany and Denmark, which also border the sea. The Wadden Sea is exceptional as a vast system of intertidal sand and mudflats, one that harbors an extraordinary diversity of species: 2,300 in its salt marshes alone, and another 2,700 in the marine and brackish areas. The diversity of bird life it supports is immense; as the UNESCO report puts it, \" Biodiversity on a worldwide scale is reliant on the Wadden Sea.\" \nThe Dutch Wadden Sea area includes the coastlines of three provinces - North Holland , Friesland and Groningen - as well as the Wadden Islands. For tips on how to experience the Wadden Sea, see the Wadden Sea World Heritage web site . 10. Willemstad Historic Districts, Curaçao \nFor the sake of completeness, there's one last UNESCO-listed site in the Netherlands that probably won't make it onto your Dutch itinerary: the Willemstad Historic District in Curaçao is some 5,000 miles from the Dutch capital, but still very much a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, beside Aruba, Sint Maarten and the European Netherlands. The Dutch established a trade post here in the 17th century, and the architecture of the historic districts - Punda, Otrobanda, Pietermaai and Scharloo - looks just like that of the Amsterdam Canal Belt, but cast in the vibrant hues of the Caribbean. The juxtaposition of historic Dutch architecture amid a tropical environment has earned it a place as the first, and so far only, World Heritage site in the Caribbean.
