Pic Frank Mc Grath 30 July 2015 03:00 AM\nThe former Miss Ireland's life is too hectic to even think about starting a family.\nSarah (31) returned to DCU last year to study fitness nutrition and sports science while continuing her modelling career both at home and abroad.\n\"It's been really tough going, working long days and nights, but I'm getting there,\" Sarah told the Diary.\nThe Dublin beauty recently celebrated her first wedding anniversary with her husband, St Patrick's Athletic goalie Pat Jennings Jnr.\nThe couple wed in the Italian town of Buggiano, where the svelte blonde walked down the aisle in a custom-made gown by Dublin- based designer Peter O'Brien.\nA year on and Sarah still loves her one-off dress and says she would jump at the chance to work with the couturier again.\n\"I have a really clear vision of what I like and what I really love and he's one of my favourite designers ever,\" she said.\n\"His aesthetic towards clothing is definitely what I love about it.\"\nPrivate\nFashion and fitness are not all Sarah has been up to - two weeks ago she was a guest on Miriam O'Callaghan's Saturday night chat show and said the rare television appearance has made her more appreciative of fans.\n\"As a result there were waves of people getting in contact,\" said the normally very private Sarah.\nAlthough she's known for gracing the pages of glossy magazines, Sarah insists there's more to her than just a pretty face and is eager to let her sense of humour shine through.\n\"Most people just see me through a photograph, so I think when they get to see you and listen to you and see your personality, that's when they get to relate to you a bit more,\" she said.\nThe chatty model is certainly ambitious, and having dabbled in broadcasting with presenting stints on RTE's TwoTube and TTV, she recently admitted she has set her sights on conquering the airwaves.\n\"I would really love to get into styling, but my dream job would be presenting as I did that for two years in RTE. I'd also love a radio programme,\" she said.\n\"I'm a really hard worker and I'll do what I have to do to earn a living.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31415028.ece/2faa6/ALTERNATES/h342/Sarah%20%20Morrissey.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-30T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:04:39.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
