Just like sardines ... people sunbathe at Levante Beach in Benidorm, Spain. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images \nAS WINTER sets in and temperatures plummet, we begin to yearn for sunnier skies. Huddled over the heater and wearing too many layers we imagine lying on that beach in Spain or sailing around the Amalfi Coast and popping into Positano for lunch, but is it really all it’s cracked up to be? \nPeople were literally packed like sardines onto Levante beach in Benidorm. According to the latest records over 29.2 million tourists visited Spain in June. People sunbathe at Levante Beach in Benidorm, Spain.

Maho beach on the idyllic island of St Maarten sits directly at the end of the tiny runway of the island’s Princess Juliana International Airport. The tranquil setting is routinely disrupted by incoming Boeing 747’s carrying new sun seekers from around the world. Tourists can be seen reaching up as if to try and grab the planes — while others seem completely unmoved by the noisy and imposing intrusion. And despite looking like a movie disaster waiting to happen, the safety record is impeccable. But an ominous sign does warn tourists daft enough to stand at the end of the runway that the giant jets blast is enough to sweep them off their feet — and potentially injure or even kill them.
