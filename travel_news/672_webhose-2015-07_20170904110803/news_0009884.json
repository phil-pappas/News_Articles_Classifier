That brief dancehall-inflected bright spot quickly shifted as he flipped the sample again, this time into a shuffling, trap-sounding two-step beat, and mixed in a verse from Skepta before transitioning to a classic from grime legend Wiley. As dusk eclipsed the day, Jamie xx turned the open-air festival into a nighttime U.K. rave.\nSan Francisco’s Giraffage provided a more youthful dance-party vibe to the mainstage on Saturday with his whimsical dream-trap, which ranged from righteous (a rework of Janet Jackson’s “Someone To Call My Lover”) to cheesy (a remix of R. Kelly’s “Ignition”). It all went over so well with the crowd that they waited patiently — almost no booing or heckling — when his sound cut out for a solid five minutes.\nHousehold-name indie outfits such as Built To Spill, TV on the Radio, Wye Oak and Toro Y Moi all brought big, full-band sounds and skillful, professional sets, which drew the 30-plus demographic that filled up the Pike Street corridor.\nBut it’s always the unexpected that provides the most rewarding experience. Take Toronto free-jazz quartet BADBADNOTGOOD, which somehow united rap and electronic fans in their teens and early 20s to rock out to extensive, vamping jams, complete with keyboard and saxophone solos. Or Los Angeles ensemble Meatbodies, clad in capes and KISS-meets-Bowie-meets-Dimmu Borgir face paint, playing raucous, riff-heavy twin-guitar rock.\nOr San Francisco’s Deafheaven, whose Explosions In the Sky-meets-shoegaze/black metal sounded like a force of nature on the Vera Stage, and may well have caused the dark skies to make rain Friday night.\nLike the suddenly cool weather, these acts were unexpected, but worked out well.\nMike Ramos on Twitter @Ram0s206", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/Ram0s206"], "published": "2015-07-27T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:55:12.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
