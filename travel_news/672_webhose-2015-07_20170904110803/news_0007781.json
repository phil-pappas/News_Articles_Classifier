Injuries can happen, and in more remote locations, tourism workers who are trained in being able to provide first aid can be crucial. \nShe points out that the Icelandic Tourism Association, along with the Icelandic Association for Search & Rescue and the Environment Agency of Iceland, put together a draft of a joint policy in 2010 to institute a number of positive changes regarding the safety and security of tourists, and she would like to see that work continued. \nIf you do travel to a more remote place in Iceland, it is highly advisable to let someone know where you are going and when you will be back. If possible, travel with someone else who knows first aid, and ask a local what kind of potential dangers you should have in mind before heading out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:14:00.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
