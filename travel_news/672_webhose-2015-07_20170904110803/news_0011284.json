The hotel has direct pedestrian access to both the airport and also the recently opened Miami Intermodal Center (MIC), which provides direct connections to South Beach and Brickell, among other regional leisure and business centers. \nThe hotel’s executive conference center offers 17,000 square feet of renovated, custom built meeting space. As the only International Association of Conference Centers (IACC) certified meeting facility in South Florida, the Executive Meeting Center accommodates both business and leisure guests at the airport and nearby corporate office parks. \nHHM is working with outside designers and with the Sheraton brand team, part of Starwood Hotels and Resorts, to further enhance the hotel’s programming through a full upgrade of the guest rooms and all public facilities. \n“The Sheraton Miami Airport is a welcome addition to our growing investment platform and represents our ninth hotel in Florida and our fifth hotel in the Miami market. We are excited about the opportunity to further grow the market penetration of this hotel within the airport and nearby submarkets. We expect strong continued growth and diversity of demand generators at Miami International Airport and in South Florida generally,” HHM President & CEO Naveen P. Kakarla said. “We are equally excited about the capable and tenured associates at this property, and look forward to including them in the HHM family as we work to upgrade and further position this hotel.” \nThe Sheraton Miami Airport Hotel was brokered by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) and now joins HHM’s managed portfolio in Miami, including the Courtyard Cadillac Miami Beach, Residence Inn Coconut Grove, Blue Moon Autograph Collection South Beach, and Winter Haven Autograph Collection South Beach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T04:06:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
