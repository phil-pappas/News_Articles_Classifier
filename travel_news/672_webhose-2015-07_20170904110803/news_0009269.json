It became world-famous after Ernest Hemingway featured it in his 1926 novel \"The Sun Also Rises\" and attracts thousands of tourists.\nTen people, including four Americans, have been gored in this year's festival.\nThe daily run see thousands of people racing six fighting bulls along a narrow 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city's bullring. Monday's dash lasted 2 minutes, 12 seconds.\nThe bulls are killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon during the festival.\nBull runs are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens are injured each year, mostly in falls.\nIn all, 15 people have died from gorings in Pamplona since record-keeping began in 1924 for the San Fermin festival.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:49:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
