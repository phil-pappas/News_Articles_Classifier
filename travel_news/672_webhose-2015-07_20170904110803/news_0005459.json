They can run with the ball or kick it. \nIn the United States, rugby gradually evolved into what the Americans call football, and they are now considered to be 2 different sports. \nIn addition to Britain, rugby is popular in Australia, Fiji, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Samoa, South Africa, Spain, Tonga, and several other countries. \nThe Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, which is held annually in March at Hong Kong Stadium, is one of the most important sporting events of the year in Hong Kong - and great fun.
