The WOW list that follows is shared as encouragement to hotel designers and general managers to put the POW in hotel suites…offer a memorable suite experience and your hotel will become part of the conversation rather than just a place to sleep. \nHave a Seat \n• MISSIONI \nNAP \nThis WOW packed modular seating system can be customized.
