The course took place during BBC Gardeners World Live and BBC Good Food Show in June. \nEvent Week Live was launched in December 2014 and gives students the opportunity to gain hands on experience of event management as well as behind the scenes insight of the event industry. Michelle Adderley, Senior Event Manager at the NEC, said: “Event Week Live is unlike anything that the industry has seen before; this is more than just work experience. The course is designed to complement classroom learning and we work closely with BCU to ensure that students are gaining experience that is directly related to their university degree.” Since its launch, Event Week Live has attracted interest from a number of industry bodies who now contribute to the course agenda. The most recent event saw representatives from International Select Events, GES and River Street Events each spent time with the students explaining their company’s role in the operations of the event. “The success of Event Week Live has exceeded all of our expectations and I believe that we will continue to see it grow,” Michelle continued. “We are offering young people the opportunity to meet some of the leading event organisers in the country which puts them in a fantastic position for future employment.” Lara Peasnall, Operation Manager at River Street Events, said: “River Street Events are proud to support Events Week Live. It’s a great opportunity for students to learn first-hand the running of an exhibition and for us to meet the next generations of organisers.” Tim Filmer, Managing Director of International Select Events, said: “Events Week Live is a fantastic initiative that gives young people invaluable experience in the events industry. It is refreshing to see the NEC recognising the importance of young people to the industry and actively trying to help them get the foot in the door.” Sarah Harper, Account Director at Global Experience Specialists (GES), said: “It was a genuine pleasure to be involved with Event Week Live and GES is proud to support an initiative like this. Whilst on site, students spent time with each project manager; they built stands, fitted graphics, did stand checks and worked on the service desk. They were a great group of young people who were genuinely interested in a career in the exhibitions and events industry. We are looking forward to working alongside the NEC for the next Event Week Live later this year.” Duncan Sedgwick, Course Director - MA Event and Exhibition Management at BCU, said: “Birmingham City University has had close links with the NEC Group for many years and the Events Week Live initiative has built on that relationship in an incredibly positive way. The students find the experience invaluable and to learn from events professionals working at the cutting edge of the industry really helps put their studies into a real life context. The university and I are looking forward to working together for years to come!” The next edition of Event Week Live is set to take place during Clothes Show Live in December.
