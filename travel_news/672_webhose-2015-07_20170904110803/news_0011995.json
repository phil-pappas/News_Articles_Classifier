They understand the importance of the tremendous growth and influence of the Asia Pacific region, and, through PATA’s various activities, they will now have access to PATA’s extensive network of members, as well as our in-depth research and insights to help them responsibly develop tourism in their country.” \n\n\nKarmen Novarlič, MSc, Head of the Tourism Division at SPIRIT Slovenia, added, “Slovenia is enhancing its involvement in international organisations specialized in the field of tourism, and thus reinforcing and building its reputation and the position of Slovenian tourism in professional institutions and associations. The Asia-Pacific region is already an exceptionally important market for the Slovenian tourism industry, accounting for over 10 per cent of all foreign guest arrivals in 2014. I am sincerely pleased that Mr Mario Hardy, the Chief Executive Officer of the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), will be our guest on the tourism panel during the Bled Strategic Forum, since we wish Slovenia to be the place where a closer relationship between Asia and Europe is built.” \n\n\nLocated in Central Europe, Slovenia is a land of green diversity, offering endless year-round outdoor activities and healthy relaxation. It is the only country in Europe that combines the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pannonian Plain and the Karst. The changing landscape is a constant surprise for international visitors. For instance, visitors can have one eye on the sea, and then look in the other direction and be surrounded by high mountains. This proximity of opposites and contrasts is a hallmark of the country, as highlighted by the yearly increase of international visitor arrivals (IVAs). According to the World Tourism Organization, the country saw a 4.8% year on year increase in IVAs in 2013, from 2.156 million to 2.259 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:45:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
