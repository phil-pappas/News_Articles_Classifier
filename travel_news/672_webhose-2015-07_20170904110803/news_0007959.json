The call and slides will also be available for replay and download after the call has ended. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce Heather Catelotti, Vice President, Investor Relations. Heather, you may begin. Heather Catelotti (VP of IR): Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement and remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning our future financial and operational performance. These forward-looking statements should also be considered in connection with cautionary statements and disclaimers contained in the Safe Harbor statement in this morning's earnings press release and our SEC filings. Our actual performance could differ materially from these statements and we undertake no duty to update these forward-looking statements. During this call, we may reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that reflect the way we evaluate the business and which we believe provide useful information for investors. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in our earnings press release and on the Investors' page at www.drpeppersnapple.com. This morning's prepared remarks will be made by Larry Young, President and CEO, and Marty Ellen, our CFO. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. With that, let me turn the call over to Larry. Larry Young (President & CEO): Thanks, Heather. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in this morning's press release, we've had a good start to the year and I am proud of what our teams have accomplished. We continue to deliver against our key priorities and we drove strong top-line and bottom-line growth in a highly competitive environment. We grew both dollar and volume share at CSDs and shelf-stable juice and expanded or held distribution and availability across our portfolio, and RCI continues to permeate our organization from bottom to top, delivering significant benefits. For the quarter, bottler case sales increased 1% on two points of positive mix in price. CSD case sales increased 1% and non-carbs increased 3% in the quarter. Brand Dr Pepper increased 1% in the quarter, driven by strong volume growth in our fountain business, regular Dr Pepper increased over 2% in the quarter, while Diet Dr Pepper declined 3% in the quarter, which represents a sequential improvement in the recent diet trend. Our core four brands declined 1% in the quarter, as a 7% increase in Canada Dry was more than offset by mid, single-digit declines in 7Up, Sunkist and A&W. Schweppes increased 8% on growth in sparkling waters and ginger ale and Squirt increased 6%. Penafiel grew 12% on increased promotional activity and distribution gains, while Crush declined 4%. All other CSD brands declined 1% in the quarter. In non-carbs, Snapple increased 11%, primarily on product innovation. Hawaiian Punch increased 2% and Mott's declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by declines in juice. Clamato grew 8% on increased promotional activity and our water category increased 6% on strong growth in Bai5, Fiji and Vita Coco. All other non-carb brands declined 3% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, bottler case sales increased 2% on two percentage points of positive mix in price. CSDs grew 2% while non-carbs increased 4%. Dr Pepper was flat year to date and our core four brands increased 1% as a 10% increase in Canada Dry was partially offset by mid, single-digit declines in 7Up and Sunkist soda and a low, single-digit decrease in A&W. Crush declined 4% and Schweppes grew 8% year to date. Squirt increased 10% and Penafiel increased 15%, while all other brands declined 1% year to date. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:15:27.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
