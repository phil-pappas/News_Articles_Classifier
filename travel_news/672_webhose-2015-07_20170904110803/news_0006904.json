KGTV CARLSBAD, Calif. -- A family of eight says their vacation rental turned into an awful experience. They said they paid $6,000 for a condo in Carlsbad and now the property manager is trying to kick them out. The property manager told Team 10 it's the family that's violating the terms of the lease. \"Our family hasn't taken a nice big vacation, ever,\" said Rachel Hawkins. The Hawkins family had just sold their home in Aurora, Colorado and it was time for a getaway. \"This was supposed to be a time to relax and recoup and get some mental health back,\" said Hawkins. She said they needed a break from the worst thing that's happened to their town--the mass shooting at the movie theater in Aurora. \"My husband was a first responder there. He's done and seen things no human being should ever have to see,\" said Hawkins. She said she booked a condo in Carlsbad for her husband and six kids through Homeaway. They paid $6,000 for 40 days. \"They have one rule here--relax, relax, relax,\" said Hawkins. The description for the home said seven people could sleep there and it was family friendly. Hawkins said it was perfect for her husband and children, including a 1-year-old. \"That's when I realized--oh goodness only two beds in here,\" said Hawkins. Hawkins said they had to turn half of the living room into a bedroom for the kids, the smoke detectors were missing batteries or missing altogether and an electrical outlet was exposed. \"My son shocked himself,\" said Hawkins. She said her son was napping upstairs when a neighbor saw him poke his head out the window. \"Just the thought of my kid falling out a window, just terrified me,\" said Hawkins. When Hawkins complained to the property manager she said he fixed the microwave and bought them air mattresses. She said things changed when she brought up the other issues. \"He canceled my reservation with the website and said that I'm trespassing. (He said) if I don't get out by 10, they'll show up with the sheriff's office and try and evict me,\" said Hawkins. She said he called police twice to the apartment. Hawkins called an attorney, Edwin Schwartz of the Edwin Schwartz Law Firm. \"When the question is, I have these issues in my place and response is you have to leave, we are evicting you--that falls under retaliatory evictions,\" said Schwartz. Hawkins paid in full until the middle of July and is hoping to get half of her money back. \"I feel like someone has stole money and vacation from my family,\" said Hawkins. The property manager, Ryan Danz, released this email in part to Team 10: The renter is a vacation rental guest and not a tenant (in landlord / tenant capacity) Who breached numerous provisions of the rental agreement, caused damages to the property, was a nuisance and threatening to our neighbors, parked illegally numerous times in the complex (violating fire codes and other blocking other vehicles & garages). we retain various communications substantiating these claims and rely on them for our decisions to terminate the rental contract. During her stay, as part of our initial good faith and fair dealings, we credited:refunded (without questioning further) and she received a $200 refund for cleaning, a new $100 microwave after she reported the one on site stopped working 2 full weeks after she took possession, and $430 in additional and new bed/bedding even though the number of people she brought into the home was greater than the number disclosed -- another violation of our agreement. The website she booked is defined as vacation rental by owner -- we are not a multi million dollar corporation with onsite maintenance or staff for round the clock issues- some of which were created by the guest outright. This unit has only 5 star reviews, and cost less than nearly every hotel in the area by a considerable margin, working out to $100/night for a 2 bed /3 bath condo, 1 mile from the beach with pools, washer/dryer, full kitchen, wifi, TV, and two parking spaces. We stand by our full breadth of testimonials as a company which can be found here: http://www.airconcierge.net/testimonials/ and are overwhelming positive, professional and evidence the great lengths we go to work with our guests, property owner clients and their homes. Hawkins showed Team 10 her agreements and numerous text messages with Danz and disagrees with his account of the situation.
