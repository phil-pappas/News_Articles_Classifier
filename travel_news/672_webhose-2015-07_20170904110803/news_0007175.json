CCA should be concerned. No matter how CCA tries to spin it and no matter how often it tries to deflect from its lack of responsibility, it cannot cover up the sad pattern of its failing to perform properly at Baha Mar and other important projects in The Bahamas as well. CCA in its release cites not a viable proposal on its part but rather a distortion of an old posture that made discussions to negotiate a consensual resolution with it as one of the parties a sham. It is why we came forward and made our very viable proposal directly to The Export-Import Bank of China. CCA failed to complete Baha Mar repeatedly on the timetables it set, its work has been called into question, it walked off the job, its failure to perform caused Baha Mar to have to seek Chapter 11 protection, and it has been uncooperative in working toward a consensual resolution.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:53:09.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
