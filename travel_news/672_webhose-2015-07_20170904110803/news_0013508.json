I was immediately attracted by the differing styles and materials of the buildings. I suppose that is evidence of the many different countries that have been responsible for ruling this area. They make a fine guide into the b/g, creating an excellent sense of perspective, and lead to the contrasting region of hills. The weather was beautiful for your purpose giving good light and colours. Have a great day, chandrapranil (1021) 2015-07-01 0:29 \nI love how you have captured the colours. Your framing and POV is excellent and really help the image stand out. TFS.
