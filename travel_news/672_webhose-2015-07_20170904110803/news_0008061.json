Whether looking for the perfect gift for loved ones and business associates or simply treat for oneself, these festive favourites will be a joy for all to savour.\nNew Offerings from Lung King Heen\nTaro and salted egg yolk is the latest addition in a selection of favourite mooncake offerings. This new cake balances the salty flavour of the egg yolk with the slightly sweet and velvety smooth texture of taro. Chinese Executive Chef Chan Yan Tak thoughtfully selects the finest taro from Thailand, where he finds this tuber has a more concentrated flavour with a light, fluffy texture, perfect for kneading fine, silky dough. This delight is certain to sate the appetite of taro lovers.\nOld favourites and new classics combine with the Assorted Mini Mooncakes box. Flavours include the white lotus seed with preserved egg and pickled ginger and five nuts and glazed ham , complemented by the new taro and salted egg yolk. It is the perfect treat for those who want it all.\nNot to be missed is the highly sought-after cream custard with toasted pine nuts mooncake, a delicacy created by Chef Tak every year since the Hotel opening.\nAll Lung King Heen mooncakes are handmade by the restaurant chefs with no preservatives. The cakes are elegantly presented in a gift box newly designed by the locally renowned Alan Chan.\nTaking inspiration from Chef Tak and his team’s finesse in handcrafting mooncakes, Alan Chan Design created a package that looks and feels more handmade than manufactured; the natural earthy colour palette of the box conveys clean, understated chic. The compartments inside the box are adorned with sketches of Chinese clouds, mountain landscape and a festive poem to pay tribute to Mid-Autumn Festival. The contemporary design complements the purity of the cakes proving that indeed, less is more.\nLung King Heen Mooncakes Selection\nLung King Heen Cream Custard with Toasted Pine Nuts (mini sized/6 pieces) – HKD 498 Lung King Heen White Lotus Seed Paste with Preserved Egg and Pickled Ginger (mini sized/ 6 pieces) – HKD 468 Lung King Heen Five Nuts and Glazed Ham (mini sized/6 pieces) – HKD 468 Lung King Heen Taro and Salted Egg Yolk (mini sized/6 pieces) – HKD 498 Lung King Heen Assorted Mini Mooncakes (mini sized/6 pieces; includes pickled ginger/five nuts/taro) – HKD 498\nTraditional Favourites\nFor those who prefer a more traditional flavour, Four Seasons white lotus seed paste mooncakes with double salted egg yolk are the perfect choice.\nThis year, bulk purchase benefits are available, making Four Seasons mooncakes a great giveaway for corporate clients.
