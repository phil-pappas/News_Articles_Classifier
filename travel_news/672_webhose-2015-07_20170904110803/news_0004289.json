She stayed at the hospital overnight.\nRogers said Veatch would likely be released Tuesday.\n\"It's a miracle, no question about it,\" Lt. Col. Jeffrey Lustick of the Civil Air Patrol told reporters, saying he has spent 30 years in search and rescue. \"Moments of joy like this can be hard to find.\"\nHer father, David Veatch of Bellingham, told reporters outside the hospital late Monday that his daughter was exhausted but doing remarkably well. She was able to joke with him about the survival shows they watched together on television, he said.\n\"She's just an amazing kid,\" David Veatch said. \"There's more to her than she knows.\"\nSantina Lampman, a longtime family friend who was in the room when Autumn called her father to report that she was OK, told the Seattle Times that the teen was glad to be alive.\n\"She did joke that it was a good thing she'd watched all those 'Survivor' shows that she didn't like, but her dad made her watch anyway,\" Lampman said.\nThe trail Autumn Veatch navigated is called Easy Pass, but the Washington Trails Association website says: \"don't be fooled by the name - the way to Easy Pass is anything but easy.\" The trail leads to the gateway of the North Cascades National Park, but along the way it passes through steep terrain.\nThe Beech A-35 left Kalispell, Montana, on Saturday afternoon, heading for Lynden, Washington. The plane crossed the Idaho-Washington border about 2:20 p.m. PDT but dropped off the radar near Omak, Washington, about an hour later, officials said.\nNavy helicopters searched for the wreckage until late Monday, several hours after airplane crews suspended their efforts. The search would resume Tuesday, weather permitting, said Barbara LaBoe, a Washington state Transportation Department spokeswoman.\nRescuers earlier narrowed down a search area based on cellphone data and typical flight patterns. But there was no sign of the aircraft or its occupants until the teen walked out of the woods.\nThe girl had been \"walking for a couple of days,\" said Rogers, the sheriff. He called her feat \"pretty impressive.\"\nSerena Lockwood, the manager at the Mazama Store, said the girl and a driver came in Monday afternoon, saying she had been in a plane crash.\n\"She was obviously pretty traumatized,\" Lockwood said.\nLeland Bowman was issued a private pilot license in 2011, and the plane, manufactured in 1949, was registered to him, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Phuong Le contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:06:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
