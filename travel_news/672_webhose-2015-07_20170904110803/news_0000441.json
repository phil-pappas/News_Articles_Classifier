Most are geared towards pure freeriding; others are more freestyle orientated – twin tipped with a centred binding-mounting point that favours riding switch and taking tricks off piste. Although they’re highly specialised, some big mountain models are versatile enough for all-mountain use. Big mountain freeride Best on test Fischer Ranger 108 Ti £680 (including bindings) Best for: Hooning down powder bowls The Ranger 108 Tis are deemed top of the group for long turns and high speed, also scoring outstandingly for liveliness/responsiveness and off piste. They're fantastic when you push them at speed. They need to be worked hard to give their best performance as they're very stiff. They're better at high speeds than low speeds. Tech talk Sidewall construction with a wood core reinforced by titanal and Fischer's Air Carbon (a lightweight material from the aerospace industry). The shovel is made from carbonfibre and is ultra-light for manoeuvrability. Rockered at the tips and tails. + Long turns, high speed, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste – Short turns, moguls Lengths: 174, 182, 188 Sidecut: 140/108/130 (all lengths) Radius: 19m (182) Best value Head Cyclic 115 £595 (including bindings) Best for: Nimble turns in powder or bumps They lead this category for liveliness/responsiveness and off piste, also performing excellently for short turns and long turns. Really stable and solid, they inspire confidence to rip up the powder. Quick turning, they whip around on the edge in deep powder pockets; they also feel good in long turns off piste. They score reasonably for moguls considering their size, but unsurprisingly, like many in this category, they garner less impressive marks for edge hold and groomed piste. Tech talk Wood core, incorporated into a partial cap construction. Tips and tails are rockered and made from a fibreglass skeleton to reduce weight, which is inlaid with elastomers (vibration-absorbing material). + Short turns, long turns, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste – Edge hold, groomed piste Lengths: 171, 181, 191 Sidecut: 148/113/131 (181) Radius: 19m (181) Women's big mountain freeride Best on test Best value Atomic Century 109 £475 Best for: Off-piste smoothness Best of this group for short turns, long turns, smoothness and moguls, these also perform excellently for off piste. Good, stable, all-round skis, they feel powerful but controllable, turning well in all types of snow. They're also responsive edge-to-edge on piste. Tech talk Cap construction with partial sidewalls underfoot, and a poplar wood core reinforced with lightweight carbon strips. Rockered 25 per cent at the tips and 10 per cent at the tails. + Short turns, long turns, smoothness, off piste, moguls – Liveliness/responsiveness Lengths: 159, 167, 175 Sidecut: 132/109/122 (167) Radius: 16.5m (167) Best on test Nordica La Nina £510 Best for: Sturdy off-piste companionship The La Ninas top the category for edge hold, long turns, high speed, liveliness/responsiveness and moguls, also scoring well for off piste. Sturdy, strong skis, they are solid in a mixture of snow conditions. They're stable, playful and agile. They prefer long turns to short, and work better at higher speeds. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a wood core strengthened with carbon. Rockered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, liveliness/responsiveness, moguls – Short turns, low speed Lengths: 161, 169, 177, 185 Sidecut: 143/113/132 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (169) Big mountain freestyle Best on test Best value K2 Shreditor Pettitor £500 Best for: Dropping cliffs into powder Designed by freeskier Sean Pettit, the Pettitors are judged best of the group for edge hold, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility, off piste and groomed piste. Extremely fun skis, they have a good amount of flex and rocker. They're perfect for powder jumps and drops at a high level, as their considerable width underfoot makes for a stable platform. Tech talk Fir/aspen wood core strengthened with fibreglass, contained within a durable sidewall construction. Rockered and tapered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, versatility, off piste, groomed piste – Moguls Lengths: 169, 179, 189 Sidecut: 147/120/141 (all lengths) Radius: 22m (179) Women's big mountain freestyle Best on test Best value Blizzard Sheeva £420 Best for: Solid edge control at speed The Sheevas dominate this group for edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness and off piste. They perform better for long turns than short, and are more at home at high speeds than at slower ones. Very responsive, they provide great edge control, especially when going fast. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a poplar/bamboo/paulownia wood core reinforced with titanium. Rockered at tips and tails. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, off piste – Short turns, low speed, groomed piste, moguls Lengths: 158, 165, 172, 179 Sidecut: 134/104/124 (all lengths) Radius: 17m (172) • Ski test winners: On-piste skis • Ski test winners: All-mountain skis • Ski test winners: Freeride skis • Ski test winners: Park & pipe skis • Ski test winners: Hike & ride skis Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:51:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
