This includes the development of a UNWTO Prototype on multi-modality – the door-to-door planning and ticketing of trips involving all possible transport options – to further integrate different means of transport between destinations around the world. \n“Innovative technological solutions are fundamental for the tourism sector’s competitiveness and ability to create jobs and inclusive development worldwide. UNWTO is looking forward to working even closer with Amadeus, a highly valued Affiliate Member and key player in this field, to strengthen the ties between tourism and technology”, said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai. \n”It gives me great satisfaction to strengthen our relationship and build upon our respective areas of expertise: technology and tourism. Amadeus is committed to strengthening the sustainability of the travel and tourism sector and already has many initiatives in two of the key agreed priorities, tourism education and innovation in technology. We look forward to amplifying these through the network of UNWTO affiliates and its events to shape the future of travel”, commented Tomás López Fernebrand, Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary of Amadeus IT Group. \nUNWTO and Amadeus will also collaborate on issues of sustainability, Corporate Social Responsibility and education through the participation of Amadeus in the UNWTO Talent Development in Tourism pilot project and in various UNWTO capacity building initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:02:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
