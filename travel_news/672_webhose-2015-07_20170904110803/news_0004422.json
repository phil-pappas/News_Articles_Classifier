A full year dividend of £93 million will be available, more than double the £46 million paid in 2014. \nChairman Sir Adrian Montague said: “Since becoming chairman in September 2014, I have seen at first hand the strong relationships MAG has with its many stakeholders and the increasingly important contribution its four UK airports continue to play at a national, regional and local level. \n“Our airports directly employ 40,000 people, with another 21,000 people employed through our supply chain. In terms of economic value, they contribute £4 billion in gross value added to the UK economy each year. \n“The group has a long-term objective of providing sustainable dividends to shareholders. \n“I am delighted to announce a final dividend of £62 million will be paid in July 2015, taking payments in respect of the full year ended March 31, 2015, to £93 million. \n“This level of dividends reflects both the strong performance in the current year and our confidence in the future of the business. \n“The outlook for the group remains strong and we will continue to focus on delivering further growth by attracting new routes and successfully delivering investment in our UK airports and growing our new US business.” \nChief executive Charlie Cornish added: “MAG has delivered a fifth consecutive year of strong growth, investment and development that has enabled us to exceed expectations across many of our key measures, including the delivery of industry leading passenger numbers and trading performance. \n“The success of MAG’s commercial and operational strategy is reflected in the fact that we have welcomed nearly 5 million more passengers into our four airports and been able to offer them an increasingly diverse range of facilities, unparalleled choice of airlines and range of destinations that has taken them all over the world. \n“I am especially pleased with the performance of our two largest airports, Manchester and London Stansted, which are both currently enjoying robust growth and have bright futures ahead of them. \n“In addition to improving the infrastructure across all of our airports, we have continued to focus an increasing proportion of our investment on projects that significantly enhance our customers’ experience of using our facilities. \n“We also announced the creation of MAG US, headed by Rosie Andolino. As the North American aviation industry continues to evolve, we are confident that our experience will position us well to capitalise on this. \n“Our airports have a vital role to play in the next 10-15 years as London expands eastwards, the Northern Powerhouse becomes a reality and runway capacity in the South East becomes even scarcer. \n“Following the Airports Commission’s submission of its final report, it is imperative that the focus of government and other stakeholders is on the practical steps needed to maximise the potential of existing airport capacity in the period before any new runway is completed. \n“We continue to request that government and Network Rail apply greater efforts to improve the rail links into Stansted and Manchester, which together can accommodate an extra 50-60 million passengers a year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:56:16.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
