This free card provides you with a certain level of medical protection that can come in handy while you are abroad. However, there are some common misconceptions about the EHIC. \nMisconception 1: The EHIC Provides the Same Cover as Travel Insurance \nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make with the EHIC is assuming it offers the same complete medical protection and extensive cover as a private travel insurance policy. Private insurance usually provides medical care in both state and private institutions, whereas the EHIC only covers state care. In addition, private travel insurance can be tailored to cover other things like trip cancellation, missed departure, legal cover, personal belongings and more. \nOne of the most important things that can be included in a private travel insurance policy is medical repatriation - specialised transport back to your home country to continue receiving treatment so you're not stuck overseas. It can be extremely expensive and is not covered by the EHIC. \nMisconception 2: All Treatment Is Free With the Card \nAlthough the EHIC provides the same level of medical care as residents of that country receive, this does not mean that your treatment will always be free. Many people wrongly assume that as long as they have the card they do not need any other medical protection as all treatment will be free. However, more often than not, there will be a cost involved, because in some countries residents are also required to pay. Additionally, be aware that you may be expected to pay a fee to receive a prescription and dental care also usually comes at a cost. \nMisconception 3: You Cannot Receive Treatment if You Lose Your Card \nAnother common mistake is to assume that you cannot get access to reduced-cost medical care if you lose your card while travelling. As long as your name is on record as having applied for the card with the NHS, all you have to do is call the number provided and you will either be sent a new temporary card, or the officials will contact the hospital directly to arrange treatment. \nIt's vital to ensure you are completely covered against any eventuality when you travel abroad. Making sure you have comprehensive medical protection should be a priority, so make sure you take out appropriate private cover alongside your free EHIC. Source:   ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nP.K.
