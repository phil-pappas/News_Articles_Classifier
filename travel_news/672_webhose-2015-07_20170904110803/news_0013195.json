Ballina was the scene of two recent shark attacks in which 32-year-old surfer Matt Lee was critically injured on July 2 and Japanese tourist Tadashi Nakahara, 41, was mauled to death while surfing in February.\nBallina is 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) north of the scene of last week's fatal attack.\nSharks are common off Australia's beaches, but fatal attacks are rare. The country has averaged fewer than two deadly attacks per year in recent decades.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T11:42:20.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
