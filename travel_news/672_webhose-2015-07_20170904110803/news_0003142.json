No, it’s time to look at the purchases we’ve made over the years that keep making us happy, no matter how silly other people think they are.\nA WATER BOTTLE\n“$48.35 isn’t cheap for a water bottle. But this isn’t just any other water bottle. This is a memobottle, a slick BPA-free H20 holder that transports 750mL of liquid gold and slides in and out of the slimmest of bags like nobody’s business. Jealous yet? You see I’ve been on a waiting list for this wanky water vessel for five weeks now and it’s finally arrived and I’m that happily hydrated it’s embarrassing. The oohs and aahs and ‘I want ones’ elicited from my colleagues when I took it to the zipTap this morning were more than enough to justify the little dent in my mortgage this month. Oh and did I mention the three interchange coloured lids? I mean, shut up and take my money. So move over cylindrical Mount Franklin bottle with crappy lid and plastic barcoded label, this is a statement in hydration. And you can’t put a price on that, can you?*\n* Technically you can, it’s about $50 bucks on your AMEX. (Don’t tell my boyfriend I paid this much for it)” - Alison Stephenson\nFans of Friends have developed a sentimental attachment to the apartments featured on the show. So why not buy a piece of history?

With the costs of having it shipped from Spain and then framed I think it ended up costing around $250, which some people think is ridiculous, but it’s my favourite thing.” - Liz Bur ke\nA CUBE\n“When I start a new job, I like to wait six months before leaving any personal belongings on my desk or around the office. If one evening I decide that it’s all become too much and I don’t want to work any more — I like having the option of being able to quit over the phone and not having to go in to collect my things. But having been in this job for just over six months now, I decided to jazz up my desk. And a chic $40 marble and timber cube was the perfect statement accessory. It makes me happy and it feels good when I rub my face on it.” - James Weir\nSOME STEAK KNIVES\n“They’re custom made steak knives from a little old man in WA. They cost $220 each and I love them S much. We ate with some at Momofuku and couldn’t stop thinking about them.” - Hannah Stenning\nAdmit it. They’re amazing, and you’re jealous.

Barney’s warehouse was having their final discounts because of Independence Day, and the cashmere track pants I’d be coveting for months were finally down to under $200 from $400. They are the warmest, lightest track pant I have ever owned. My partner refers to them as my gangsta pants, as apparently they would be the only people that would ever wear them.” - Monika Jansch\nA TOOTHBRUSH\n“This week my partner became the proud new owner of an Oral-B electric toothbrush, which originally hit the market for a princely $330. This isn’t your regular electric toothbrush — this piece of dental wizardry is Bluetooth-connected and hooks up to an app that tracks your brushing session, offers “dentist approved feedback” (such as when you’re applying too much pressure — who knew?) and tracks your overall “brushing progress” over time. It also comes with motivational messages, reminders and “rewards”. Oh, it polishes and deep cleans your pearly whites as well, putting my humble $6 supermarket toothbrush to great shame.”- Lauren McMah\nA LAMP\n“It wasn’t completely outrageous, but recently I threw out a perfectly good lamp because it was ugly and I couldn’t be bothered finding a new globe for it when it blew. In its place I splashed out on a lovely soft-white ceramic lamp, with cut-out designs that project a gorgeous pattern on my bedroom wall. It was completely unnecessary, but every time I walk into my room and switch the lamp on I smile with the golden glow my purchase has given me.” - Kate Calacouras\nI bought it because I’m worth it.

But in a moment of weakness after a stressful day at work I thought screw it, I’m doing it. My killer purchase was timed perfectly with the arrival of the ‘Antarctic vortex’, so I’ve been able to achieve the impossible: stay snug AND look hella cute when it’s 5 degrees and raining heavily. It’s warm, it’s comfortable and I feel like a total boss strutting around in it. Yes, my jumper game is better than yours.” - Rebecca Sullivan\nOriginally published as The silliest things our money has bought", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/money-can-buy-happiness-just-depends-what-you-buy/story-fneuz5ql-1227445634238", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/634186-1887f770-2b72-11e5-8757-04ffb4d51cf7.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/634212-e62445c2-2c1b-11e5-a754-a63f13c4fffa.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/634158-752e5dd6-2c15-11e5-a754-a63f13c4fffa.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-17T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:19:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
