PARK CITY, UT, July 15,   The 2015-2016 ski season will see major changes to Park City and its world-famous ski resorts, as Vali Resorts has unveiled its plan to bring over $50 million in upgrades to Park City Mountain Resort and Canyons. The most innovative part of this plan is to connect both resorts to create the largest ski resort in North America, which will create over 7,000 square miles of skiing, new dining options, new ski lifts that will streamline the slopes, and machines for making snow to create an all-inclusive ski resort that investors hope will bring thousands of visitors to the area in the coming years. While this project is good news for those who already enjoy the area's skiing, it may also be a boon for prospective home buyers, who may see a rise in property values once the improvements are complete. There are currently a number of Deer Valley homes and Canyons real estate for sale, from single-family homes to condominiums to large, lodge-style homes that are perfectly suited to anyone who has always dreamed of owning a home just steps away from some of the country's most exciting ski slopes, as well as all of the dining and shopping options that Park City provides. Home buyers who are considering investing in Canyons real estate may see a great return on their investment in the near future, when the new multi-million ski resort is unveiled for the 2015-2016 season.
