It will highlight the inadequacies of measuring success using only proxy indicators such as visitor numbers - which does not provide clear insight into the impact of those visitors.The research will also show the importance of going beyond basic economic measures. For instance, tourism tax receipts are not often discussed as a benefit for destinations, but were found to be a very significant benefit for Cyprus, equivalent to â‚¬25 per customer per night. Airport departure tax accounted for just ten percent of this total, which includes other taxes such as corporation tax, VAT and income tax.The study also shows that a significant amount of the total impact of tourism comes \"indirectly\" from supply chain activities and tourism spend. For example, supply chains and other services used by customers were found to generate almost 14 times as much waste as the hotels themselves (1.8kg of rubbish per customer per night from hotels compared with 25kg from the supply chain).The report is now available for free on the Travel Foundation's website HERE Valere TjolleYou've done the work now get the benefits - make your green destination visible HERE \nTuesday, July 7, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:30:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
