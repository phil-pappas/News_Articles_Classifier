With that I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Hayes, CEO of Ball Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. John Hayes (Chairman President & CEO): Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the Company's second quarter 2015 results. The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Several factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the Company's latest 10-K and in other Company SEC filings as well as the Company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at Ball.com. Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam, and consistent with the requirements of the UK takeover code we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to four areas: number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 release that was published in February; number two, where we are in the regulatory process; number three, the outcome of the Ball Special Shareholders Meeting; and number four, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction. Also note that there may be certain limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction. Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decisions in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme documents which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the Offer for Rexam page on Ball.com. Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our Company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the second half of 2015. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations and the operations are fundamentally strong. The headwinds we acknowledged in early February and late April around earnings translation, aluminum premiums, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in North American food and our Brazil beverage can operations continued and deferred compensation costs related to director retirements flowed through in the quarter. Scott will go into more detail in terms of quantifying what we believe are transitory costs and headwinds. In total these headwinds represented approximately $0.23 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.39 year to date. As we said in April, overriding these headwinds are the investments we are making to operationally and strategically position Ball for future growth. As you know, on February 19 we announced our proposed offer for Rexam. Earlier this week Ball shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the share issuance proposal and I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their support of the Board's recommendation. While we continue to make progress on the process around the proposed acquisition of Rexam, including our ongoing work with the US FTC, moving to Phase 2 with the European Commission and formally filing with the Brazilian regulatory authorities, we remain focused day to day on the maximizing the value of what we currently do and generating strong free cash flow. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:59:36.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
