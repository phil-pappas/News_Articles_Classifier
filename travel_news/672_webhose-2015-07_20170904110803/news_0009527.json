Joyce, president and chief executive officer, Choice Hotels. \"Once again our RevPAR performance continued to outpace the gains reported by Smith Travel Research in the chain scale segments in which we compete and as reflected in our franchise sales results our programs to accelerate the growth of the Cambria hotels and suites and Comfort brands have been well received by developers and franchisees. We continue to be optimistic that these programs will drive the continued improvement and expansion of these brands.\" \nDiscontinued Operations \nDuring 2014, the company entered into and completed a plan to sell its three owned hotels operated under the MainStay Suites brand. The company determined that the sale of these hotels met the definition of a discontinued operation since the operations and cash flows of these components have been eliminated from the on-going operations of the company and the company does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of the hotels after the transaction. As a result, the company's consolidated statement of income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, reflects these three company-owned hotels as discontinued operations. \nSummarized financial information related to these discontinued operations is presented in Exhibit 9 of this press release. \nOutlook \nThe company's consolidated 2015 outlook reflects the following assumptions: \n• All figures assume no repurchases of common stock under the company's share repurchase program; and \n• The effective tax rate for continuing operations is expected to be approximately 32% for both the third quarter and full-year 2015, respectively. \nFranchising \n• EBITDA from franchising activities for full-year 2015 are expected to range between $254 million and $257 million; • Net domestic unit growth for 2015 is expected to be approximately 1%; \n• RevPAR is expected to increase approximately 6.5% for the third quarter and range between 6.5% and 7.5% for full-year 2015; and \n• The effective royalty rate is expected to increase 2 basis points for full-year 2015 as compared to full-year 2014. SkyTouch \n• Net reductions in EBITDA relating to our investment in the SkyTouch division for full-year 2015 are expected to range between $15 million and $20 million. \nConsolidated Outlook \nThe company's third quarter 2015 diluted EPS is expected to be $0.72. The company expects full-year 2015 diluted EPS to range between $2.18 and $2.22 and full year 2015 EBITDA to range between $237 million and $241 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:49.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
