Seoul, South Korea (13.0 days) 2. Dubai, UAE (12.7 days) 3. Milan, Italy (12.3 days) 4. Athens, Greece (11.5 days) 5. Singapore (11.1 days) 6. Frankfurt, Germany (11 days) 7. Sao Paulo, Brazil (tied 10.6 days) 7. Hong Kong, China (tied 10.6 days) 8. Bali, Indonesia (10 days) 9. Lisbon, Portugal (9.7 days) 10. Tokyo, Japan (9.6 days) 11. Crete, Greece (9.2 days) 12.
