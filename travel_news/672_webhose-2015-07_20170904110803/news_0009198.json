Last year, the government identified two SOEs to implement a pilot ownership reform: China National Building Material Group and China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp . During the reform, roughly 50 per cent of China’s SOEs would likely be opened for mixed ownership, according to Zhou Fangsheng, deputy director of the China Enterprise Reform and Development Society , a body under the State Council’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Mixed ownership would mean that large SOEs, which have traditionally held monopolies in many strategic industries, could form joint ventures using non-state capital. Allowing state capital, non-state capital and employees to each hold one-third of the shares is a suitable proportion for next step in mixed ownership Mr Zhou said sources of non-state capital include domestic private investors, foreign investors, and SOE employees. He added that SOEs at both central and local levels offer opportunities for foreign investors. The commission covers 113 nonfinancial central SOEs and 98,554 local government-owned companies. Central enterprises controlled about 53 per cent of all SOE assets by the end of last year, totalling 91 trillion yuan (£9.6 trillion), according to the Ministry of Finance. Mixed ownership would provide an opportunity for foreign enterprises to enter some industries blocked to private investors and some that seek greater marketisation, Mr Zhou said. “It’s possible that foreign capital could become the largest shareholder of an SOE through the mixed-ownership reform, but don’t expect it to become a majority shareholder,” he said. “Allowing state capital, non-state capital and employees to each hold one-third of the shares is a suitable proportion for the next step in mixed ownership.” Some monopolised industries such as the electricity sector and railways, or companies closely related to security such as producers of military goods, are not suitable for mixed ownership reform, he said. The planned reform, which was still being finalised, was likely to identify which industries would qualify, while “the degree of openness for private capital will be higher than foreign capital”, he added. The Third Plenum of the Communist Party of China’s 18th Central Committee in November 2013 set the agenda for a new round of SOE reform, and the concept of mixed ownership was strongly endorsed. In March, Premier Li Keqiang also listed the promotion of mixed ownership as one of the seven tasks to accelerate China’s SOE reform in his annual Government Work Report. Chinese leaders have vowed to formulate measures for non-state capital to participate in the investment projects of central government enterprises as well as formulate measures to allow non-public enterprises to participate in franchising. However, the pace has been relatively sluggish, according to experts. China’s SOE reform has stagnated over the past decade, while SOEs have been increasingly criticised for their low efficiency. As the economy slows further and financial pressure on local governments increases, privatisation should become more acceptable The productivity gap between stateowned and private companies has widened since the financial crisis in 2008, with an average return on assets for state entities at about 4.6 per cent compared with 9.1 per cent for private companies, according to estimates last year by Gavekal Dragonomics , an economic research company in Beijing. Andrew Batson, the company’s China research director, said mixed ownership did not imply an embrace of mass privatisation. China was unlikely to repeat the type of rapid privatisation seen in some countries or regions in the 1990s, he said, but added: “As the economy slows further and financial pressure on local governments increases, privatisation should become more acceptable.” Local governments have moved more quickly than central authorities in implementing SOE reform, as they needed to find new sources for revenue and lower their liabilities. Prospects for a mixed-ownership economy will ultimately depend on willingness to cede control of the nation’s largest enterprises to private interests More than 20 provinces and municipalities have announced local reform plans, including promoting mixed ownership and restructuring state capital. Yang Tao, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Institute of Finance and Banking , said the central government, by promoting a mixed-ownership economy, had brought about a turning point in central and local SOE reform. To avoid inefficient decision-making as well as corruption, local governments needed to improve transparency of their reforms and strengthen public supervision, he said. However, some private business leaders have raised concerns that they would have no influence as board members of mixed ownership companies. In addition, a policy memorandum from the Paulson Institute, a think tank on China-United States relations, warned that improvements in performance would not automatically follow private investment in China’s state-controlled companies. Reform should lead to the opening-up of state-owned monopolies, creating interesting new investment opportunities and a fairer environment... “The prospects for a mixed-ownership economy will ultimately depend on the state’s willingness to cede control — not just ownership — of some of the nation’s largest enterprises to private interests,” the memorandum said. Analysis posted on the website of Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said local branches of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission “have been keen to emphasise to us that they encourage foreign as well as domestic investment” in SOEs. “For now, genuinely interesting commercial opportunities may be limited,” the analysis went on. “However, reform, if thoroughly implemented, should lead to the opening-up of state-owned monopolies, creating interesting new investment opportunities and a fairer environment for all companies, domestic and foreign, to compete.” READ MORE: • Firm footing for Asia's economic growth • With the AIIB, there is no pain for the West, only gain • In Pakistan, Chinese firm helps ease an energy crisis • State bank shake-up to increase private ownership • Regulator told to fix auditing shortfall This article was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:30:22.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
