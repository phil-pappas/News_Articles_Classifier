In comparison to the first quarter of 2014, visitor arrivals from the Americas also grew by 17%, from Europe by 9% and from Asia by 7%. \nThe report also showed that visitors from various GCC countries, Qatar’s largest tourism market, increased by 16% in the first quarter. \nBesides Saudi Arabia, visitor arrivals from Bahrain, Oman, and the UAE also grew by modest rates during the first quarter of this year. \nAl-Qurese said they have been working closely with their partners to attract more tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:44:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
