Paul Boerigter, 88, always wanted to visit Alaska and Denali National Park where his son, Bill, had led several glacier climbs in the 1990s. On June 22, Paul was able to check this off his bucket list when his daughter and son-in-law, Karen and Dave Westrate of Holland and his grandson, Ben Boerigter, took the flight from Talkeetna, Alaska, around Mt. McKinley to include a landing on Ruth Glacier. From the air, they were also able to view a climbers' base camp similar to the camp where son Bill had spent several summers. This was one of several excursions taken during the family's Alaskan Cruise. Send us your travel photos Send your scenic travel photo to lori.timmer@hollandsentinel.com or 54 W.
