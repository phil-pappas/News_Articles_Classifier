It is of great importance that the US keeps on investing in infrastructure and human capital to sustain the demand for expansion and talent in the Travel & Tourism sector and continues its great efforts on visa facilitation. I am extremely pleased that our annual Global Summit 2016 will take place in Dallas, where we will continue to discuss the challenges and celebrate the importance of our sector in the US and beyond.”\nRelated Posts Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android India’s Travel & Tourism: more jobs than education, financial services and mining combined", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:20:50.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
