SORTA’s planning and operations committee is scheduled to meet at 8:30 a.m. Monday followed by a SORTA board meeting in which the streetcar’s operations and maintenance contract would be approved. The temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction ask the court to preclude SORTA from awarding the contract because Cincinnati’s City Council failed to take action required to make SORTA’s decision legally binding. Over the past two weeks, council has failed to come to a consensus on whether ATU Local 627 members who work for SORTA but are managed by a private company should drive the streetcars or whether a private company should hire all of the streetcar employees. Because council punted, the decision now is up to the SORTA board, which plans to decide which operations framework to use on Monday. Council needed to make a decision by the end of June for SORTA to award the third-party operator contract in July, the injunction states. Council’s last meeting before the summer break was held on July 1. A decision wasn’t made in that meeting, and council members aren’t scheduled to meet again until Aug. 5. “Should SORTA select the method of operating service — either the turnkey or management option- and award the contract to a third-party operator during the July 6, 2015 meeting as is planned, without City Council’s consent, the contract SORTA awards will have no legal effect,” the injunction states. The ATU, AFL-CIO and other parties claim the city failed to comply with its legal obligation and expressed concern that the planned actions will delay the streetcar’s service set to begin in September 2016 and the delivery and testing of streetcar vehicles expected to begin in September 2015 while also adding to the project’s cost. “This action is about public trust, transparency and greater accountability concerning this important Cincinnati taxpayer-funded public project,” the AFL-CIO said in a statement announcing the legal action. “The city and SORTA are obligated to follow the terms of their Intergovernmental Operations agreement, and related ordinances and motions.” The groups also stated they believe SORTA is misleading the city because it won’t provide verifying information or documentation about the operations proposals including company names, budget numbers, safety records and more. SORTA has claimed it is unable to provide that information under federal requirements. The Cincinnati streetcar is a $133 million project with 18 stops along a 3.6-mile route. The ATU, which represents about 750 employees in Greater Cincinnati, believes the streetcar operators should be SORTA employees subject to the wage, health care and retirement benefit structure of the union’s contract with the transit agency. SORTA has estimated that the cost of union option exceeds the cost of the so-called “turnkey” option by at least $700,000 and will bust the city’s streetcar budget by $500,000 in the first year. The ATU argues that its employees could do the job within the streetcar budget if SORTA were not charging the city management fees. Such fees are assessed under both the union and turnkey options. \nWant Cincinnati Legal Services news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
