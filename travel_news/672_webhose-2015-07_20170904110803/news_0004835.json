Dozens are injured each year, mostly in falls. \nIn Pamplona's final run, hundreds of people raced alongside six fighting bulls from the renowned Miura ranch, considered among the fiercest in Spain. \nOne bull charged into a bunch of runners, knocking around 10 people to the ground. \nThe San Fermin press office said five people were treated in city hospitals for bruises suffered in falls or from being trampled on by the beasts or other runners but none was in serious condition. No one was gored Tuesday. \nThe July 6-14 fiesta, named after the northern city's patron saint, dates back to the late 16th century. It was immortalized in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel \"The Sun Also Rises\" and attracts thousands of tourists. \nThe 8 a.m. runs see people dashing with six bulls and their guiding steer along a narrow 850-metre course from a holding pen to the city's bullring. Tuesday's run lasted 2 minutes, 5 seconds, the fastest of the eight held in the festival. \nThe bulls are killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon during the festival.
