The airline is the first in America and the third in the world to receive this certification, which was awarded during IATA’s last Annual General Meeting in Miami.\nIEnvA is an innovative environmental management system for flight operations and corporate activities specifically developed for the airline industry. LATAM Airlines Group, together with other airlines, has been working with IATA over the last three years to develop the system. “The objective of IEnvA, similar to IOSA but focused on environmental topics, is to improve the environmental management and performance of airlines around the world,” said Enrique Guzmán, Senior Environmental Manager at LAN.\nTony Tyler, Director Ge\nneral and CEO of IATA, delivered the recognition to Roberto Alvo, Senior VP of Network & Fleet of LATAM Airlines Group during the 2015 IATA AGM in Miami, in the United St\nates. “Achieving this certification is an important step for our company. This was only possible thanks to the support of all the areas of the company. It is proof of our dedication to combat climate change and to being one of the leading airline groups that cares about the environment,” said Roberto Alvo.\nTony Tyler added, “I congratulate LATAM Airlines Group for obtaining the IEnvA certification for its international flights operating from Chile. The continuous improvement in environmental performance is essential for the aviation industry, and LATAM Airlines Group has demonstrated its commitment to sustainability by implementing this system.”\nIEnvA will allow LATAM Airlines Group to achieve the ambitious goals it has set in the environmental area, including:\nIATA Objective 2: Carbon Neutral growth in 2020 IATA Objective 3: by 2050, achieve a 50% reduction in net CO2 emissions from 2005 levels Carbon Neutral Ground Operations in 2020 A 10 per cent improvement in energy efficiency in the company’s infrastructure by 2020 Savings of USD$200,000 in energy consumption by facilities in 2020 A 10 per cent decrease in waste volume in 2020. Basis for the IEnvA program for aviation\nIEnvA is an innovative environmental management system for flight operations and corporate activates based on internationally recognized standards adapted to the specific needs of the airline industry.\nIEnvA is made up of two stages: an initial stage, which includes the generation and implementation of an environmental commitment policy; a survey of the most significant environmental aspects of airline operations and corporate activities; and the evaluation of legal environmental compliance in countries where the company operates. LATAM Airlines Group received this first stage of certification in June 2013 for international flights operated from Chile and cargo flight operations out of Miami.\nThe second stage includes the implementation of management and operational control programs; communication and training of the airline’s employees; and an internal and external audit. LATAM Airlines Group has been implementing this process since 2014 and reached completion this year with the certification of the complete system for international flights operated out of Chile. The company is currently working to extend the certification to the group’s other operations.\nSource:- LATAM Airlines\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
