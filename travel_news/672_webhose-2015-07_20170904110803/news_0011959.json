Over 61 percent of Greek voters on July 5 rejected fresh austerity demands by the country’s EU-IMF creditors in a historic referendum, official results from 50 percent of polling stations showed. Andreas Solaro/AFP \nBERLIN, Germany — German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the outcome of Greece’s referendum with French President Francois Hollande in a telephone call Sunday evening, with both agreeing the ‘No’ vote must be respected, a German government spokesman said. \n“Both were in agreement that the vote by the Greek people be respected. The chancellor and the president are in favor of calling for a summit of eurozone heads of state and government heads on Tuesday,” the spokesman said. \nThe two leaders had sent a corresponding request to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, according to sources in the French presidency. \nThere are no explicit provisions in EU rules for summits of eurozone leaders, but they can be held in exceptional circumstances. The last such summit was held in Brussels last month. \nDuring the evening, Hollande spoke separately by telephone with Merkel, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, European Parliament head Martin Schulz and Tusk, the French sources said. \nOfficial results from close to 90 of Greece’s polling stations showed more than 61 percent of Greeks had voted ‘No’ to creditor demands for further austerity in return for further bailout funds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T00:25:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
