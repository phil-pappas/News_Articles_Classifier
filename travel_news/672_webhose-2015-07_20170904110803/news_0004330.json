U.S. coffee and doughnut chain Krispy Kreme said in May it will open 31 stores in South Africa within five years. \nInvestors are often drawn to South African companies who can offer a gateway into faster-growing economies elsewhere on the continent. \n\"It's quite a big market in South Africa. We have got established players with lots of experience,\" said Wayne McCurrie, portfolio manager at Momentum Wealth. \n\"Maybe more importantly, if Africa shows the growth potential over the next decade that everyone expects, then this is a good base to start from,\" McCurrie added. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Taste hit a record high in the session and were up 19.9 percent at 5 rand per share, more than 56 percent year-to-date.
