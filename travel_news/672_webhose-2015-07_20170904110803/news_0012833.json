Nor would you buy a car that was guaranteed not to start 12 mornings each month.\nFor that matter, you probably wouldn’t depend on the bus to get you work if you knew it would get you there significantly (and job-threateningly) late two days each week. Indeed, a 40 percent failure rate – which all of these hypotheticals represent – would be unacceptable to all of us when it comes to making even ordinary, let alone major purchases or life decisions.\nYet every day almost 2.2 million people willingly – even gleefully in some cases – board U.S. airliners despite the fact that around 850,000 them won’t get to their intended destination on time. In more stark terms, about 310 million U.S. airline passengers – a number almost equal to the nation’s population – will be late this year. Roughly 40 percent of all U.S. air travelers have arrived late consistently for most of the last 35 years. And unless things change dramatically, about 40 percent of all U.S. air travelers will continue to arrive late every year, perhaps forever.\nAirlines, no doubt, will argue that their on-time performance is not that bad. In fact, they’ll argue that it’s only half as bad as that – literally. In April, the last month for which the Department of Transportation has reported such numbers, 81.8 percent of flights arrived on time . But the dirty little secret behind those monthly statements from the DOT’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics is that its definition of “on time” is not really what you would think of as being, well, “on time.”\nInstead, the DOT counts any flight that arrives less than 15 minutes after its scheduled arrival time as having arrived on time. Thus, if you’re flight is scheduled to arrive at 3:15 p.m. and it doesn’t get in until 3:29, it’s not late – not officially anyway. You may be 14 minutes late to your meeting. You may miss your connecting flight. Or the person waiting to pick you up may have to circle the parking lot 14 extra times, but your flight’s not officially counted as late.\nBut if you count all flights that arrive after their scheduled arrival time, even if they’re late by only 1 minute, the industry consistently operates about 40 percent of all flights late. Just last month, United managed to bring only half of its flights in on, or before their published arrival times. Southwest, which used to tout its punctuality as being way better than that of its competitors, didn’t do much better. Just 53 percent of its flights arrived on, or before their scheduled arrival times. American, which in the ‘90s ran ads calling itself “The On Time Machine,” brought in only 60 percent of its flights on, or before the time they were scheduled to arrive. Delta led the league with a still-unimpressive 66 percent real on time arrival rate using the same standard of measurement.\nAirline “A-0″ On Time Performance: Percentage of Flights That Arrived Within One Minute Of Their Scheduled Arrival Time Date American Delta Southwest United AVERAGE 60.6% 69.3% 61.5% 60.1% Mar-15 57.0% 65.7% 61.5% 57.0% Apr-15 61.1% 69.1% 62.5% 63.0% May-15 63.6% 73.1% 60.6% 60.3% - Source: ATH GROUP\nSurprisingly, perhaps, such shoddy delivery of the promised service is not the result of either bad weather or poor management of the government-operated Air Traffic Control system. To be sure, weather is responsible for some flight delays. There’s little that can be done about that. After all, who really wants to take off, or land in the middle of violent thunderstorm, a blizzard, or a haboob?\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/april-time-performance-cancellations-down-previous-year-march-2015", "http://airlines.org/news/2014-passenger-airline-results-and-2015-spring-air-travel/"], "published": "2015-07-06T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T21:44:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
