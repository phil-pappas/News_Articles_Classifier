The entire Hakuba Valley is gleaming white, which is as it should be. It’s a cheek-slicing cold, the kind that could kill a person.\nBut this is the least of my worries as I stand on the brink of an icy mogul descent on the slopes of Happo-One (pronounced O-neh) shrouded in a snow-lashing wind that means I can see no further than my ski boots. Mogul comes from the Old Norse word “mugl” meaning “little heap”.\nIt’s our first day on the snow and I was reluctant to go anywhere near a mogul. But the young instructor from Evergreen Ski School thought they might have “softened” and my husband wanted me to try. I curse them both, set off down the nearest mogul, collapse, get up, collapse and do this 10 times before I reach the bottom. The Japanese, I’m told, love moguls.\nLuckily, Hakuba Valley has many other ski fields. It’s nothing like my earlier ski experience in New Zealand’s Queenstown and Australia’s Perisher Valley, where there’s one mountain base, and all the runs and the ski school are controlled by the same operator. Experienced skiers will enjoy Happo-One in Hakuba. Picture: Mike Powell/Allsport Source: Supplied\nIn Hakuba, the nine ski fields in the mountain range are managed discretely and the schools operate independently. It can be disorientating as you work out which one offers what in terms of terrain and facilities.\nThe valley has a total of five gondolas, 108 lifts, 144 courses and 130km of trails, with free shuttle buses between the ski resorts. But the lift passes are not always compatible and you must buy these on top of the school lessons.\nSome friends of ours suggest Hakuba Goryu, where the slopes of Iimori are long and shapely at the foot of the mountain, perfect precursors for the gondola. This is not, ha ha, a boat, but a bubble-like cable car that takes you to heights you’d never dream of attaining in an ordinary chair lift. The view of the opposite mountains – tree rows etched into the white jagged landscape as if painted in charcoal – is stupendous. It’s giddying up there and I do it only because our friends have lent us their ski instructor, an amiable New Zealander called Sam.\nSam works for Daniel Mee, the director of the Hakuba Snow Sports School at Goryu. Mee tells me that Goryu/Iimori is good for beginners and intermediate skiers, Iwatake is perfect for intermediate folk and Happo-One is for experienced skiers. It’s a nuisance then that we are staying at Happo-One, and have booked our kids into the Evergreen Ski School. Though competent 10-year-old Iris enjoyed her day with Evergreen, four-year-old Banjo much prefers Goryu. Snow covers a temple in Happo Village. Picture: Nicole Walker Source: Supplied\nFrom the Goryu gondola it’s possible to traverse the mountain to the next gondola at Hakuba 47 resort. The easy run between larch trees filigreed with snow is gorgeous. Otherwise, there’s a challenging track down to Goryu base (where the noodle house next to the ski school offers a fortifying lunch).\nOur Hakuba pals, who’ve come here for the past five years, told us that the Valley throngs with Japanese holiday-makers until January 5. So we arrive on that day gleefully anticipating a week on the fabled powder snow. But fate intervenes and not only does Banjo fall sick but, unusually, it rains all day on the sixth. This turns the snow into slush and then into icy clumps.\nWe are staying at Hakuba Springs Hotel in what they call a junior suite. A diligent receptionist called Ariel Lee organises a taxi to the nearest clinic. I’m armed with the Japanese translation of scarlet fever and the name of the antibiotic Banjo will need. This is helpful, because the doctor doesn’t speak any English.\nLee also organises restaurant bookings each night and the requisite taxis. Shuttle buses run between the major pubs and centres, but hungry four-year-olds need to be fed promptly (the antibiotic works a treat). Bookings are essential because the valley’s restaurants are small and fill up quickly. We try the quirky Hummingbird (aptly tiny) in Wadano, the Kikyo-ya sushi in Hakubo-cho, which is wonderful, the Korean BBQ Murakame in Echoland (not so good for small inflexible kids), and, tiring of adventures, the Cru Cafe, five minutes’ walk from the hotel, which provides good pizzas, oven-roasted broccoli and decent Italian wines.

And turn green at the sight of their three-bed apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the snowy forest. Still, Hakuba Springs has an onsen and this is a huge pleasure.\nWe had intended to bunk off skiing for a day and see the snow monkeys, which is a highly recommended tour, but what with the illness and the rain, we’re down to three days on the slopes. Two of those are near perfect and on the last it snows, and doesn’t stop. We brave the gondola and do several runs on the thickening powder of the upper slopes. It’s a long weekend in Japan and an anime costume festival is on at Hakuba 47. Japanese snowboarders in tights, dresses and wigs flash past.\nAt day’s end a thick mantle of snow settles on us while we sit on the last chairlift admiring the crystal trees. I am bone-numbingly cold. Tomorrow, the sun will burst out and turn Hakuba into the magical winter wonderland of our dreams.\nGO2\nHAKUBA VALLEY\nGETTING THERE\nQantas flies direct to Narita (80km from Tokyo) only from Sydney.
