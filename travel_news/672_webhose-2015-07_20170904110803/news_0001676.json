With locations in key international cities and designed with strong Oriental influences, complemented by warm and dedicated service at all times, tailored to the unique needs of each guest. Developed around the brand values of “Personality”, “Finesse” and “Bliss”, Wanda Vista hotels offer 21 signature services including Wanda Vista Angel, Wanda Vista Walker, Cha Journey, The Book of Liki, Personalized Service, Wanda Romance Wedding Ceremony, Dream Catcher, Bed of Vista and more. \nWith plans to expand to overseas markets by 2018, Wanda Vista will also be the company’s first international brand. The first six overseas markets targeted for this expansion will be London, Madrid, Sydney, the Australian Gold Coast, Chicago and Los Angeles. \n“Wanda Hotels & Resorts is dedicated to its company mission to uphold Chinese values, build mutual respect, and perform beyond expectations. Even as we are shaping this international brand, we hope to stay true to this mission and bring Eastern hospitality to the world,” said Mr Qian. \nWanda Vista hotels will be within the most central and strategic locations of each city and feature cutting-edge architecture to give it the distinctions of a new local landmark. \n“We aim to be the leading hotel choice at each destination, embracing Chinese tradition and values to deliver an outstanding experience for both business and leisure travelers, domestically and internationally,” added Mr Qian. \nBy the end of 2020, Wanda Hotels & Resorts aims to own and operate over 160 hotels worldwide. \nSince the first Wanda Vista opened its doors in Taiyuan in 2012, the brand has continued to expand across Mainland China. By the end of 2014, there were a total of 10 Wanda Vista hotels operating in major Chinese cities including Shenyang, Yantai, Tianjin, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Changsha, Kunming, Nanning, Dongguan and Quanzhou. In November this year, another Wanda Vista will open in Hohhot city. \nWanda Vista Resort Xishuangbanna, the company’s first resort hotel, will officially begin operations on September 26, marking an important milestone for Wanda Vista, and kick off the brand’s dual target to develop both luxury 5-star hotels and resorts. Wanda Vista Resort Xishuangbanna is located in Jinghong city of Xishuangbanna province, a prime location within a word-class holiday destination. The hotel incorporates local architectural influences into its design and uses locally-sourced materials and handcrafted artworks, offering guests with a sense of place experience of the local art and culture. The resort spans a spacious built area of 46,149 square meters and houses 151 elegantly appointed rooms and suites, as well as luxurious facilities such as meeting rooms, a spa, a pagoda tower and more. \nAs part of the activities for the 300 VIP guests at the event, a series of local Shanxi cultural activities were set up behind the majestic grand entrance of the Wanda Vista Taiyuan, which was modeled after the distinctive architecture of traditional Shanxi Qiao Family Courtyard. The hotel had invited renowned local artisans including Ms Kwok Mei-Hua, who performed a live demonstration of the intricate folk art of paper cutting, and local master craftsmen who presented traditional figurine sculpting. Even the refreshment break was curated with a sense of place theme, as guests experienced the local culture through its traditional art of fine tea, cakes and noodle dishes. This was followed by a magnificent live gong performance which heightened spirits both on and off stage. After that, a special presentation titled “The Changing of the Four Seasons” celebrated both Chinese traditions and the company’s brand values through the combined artistry of videography, dance, animation and lighting for a multi-sensory experience; a truly exciting way to share the Wanda Vista brand story. To end the night on a high note, a children’s choir delivered a touching song, after which Wanda Hotels & Resorts announced their special donation of RMB 1 million to the Wanda Children’s Foundation by the China Charity Federation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T22:05:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
