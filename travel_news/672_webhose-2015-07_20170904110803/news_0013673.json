Agencies can use the data to enhance sales monitoring, inform marketing strategies and improve supplier management. \n\nThe suite is powered by Amadeus’ cloud-based Big Data platform, the Travel Intelligence Engine, which gathers and analyses intelligence across the entire travel cycle. \n\nPasacal Clement, head of Travel Intelligence at Amadeus, said in a press statement: “Understanding how travellers search and book for travel is vital for travel players. Search Analysis and Booking Analysis will empower travel consultants to leverage data and target the right travellers at the right time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:38:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
