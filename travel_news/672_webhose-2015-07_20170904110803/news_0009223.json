In 2013, Calcasieu Parish was number six in Louisiana for visitor spending at $384.5 million. And the Lake Charles Southwest Louisiana Convention and Visitors Bureau is looking to grow that number. The CVB recently released the results of a study designed to give them a better understanding of how Southwest Louisiana community leaders, visitors and residents perceive the area. “We’re going to implement this information into our marketing strategy and continue to aggressively market the area to the leisure traveler, the business traveler and anyone who wants to have a fantastic time,” said CVB Communications Director Angie Manning, in a presentation of the study. The Perception Study, prepared by Young Strategies, Inc., a travel industry research firm out of North Carolina, surveyed 1,732 visitors and residents, a well as 108 community leaders, and conducted an analysis of the local lodging market. According to Manning, community leaders’ perceptions of the area overall are good. “They think it’s a really good place to live and work,” she said. “A great place for sports and leisure and a great place to retire.” According to study results, the top five priorities for possible initiatives among these leaders are developing new lakefront shopping/dining, enhancing the quality of workforce and training, bringing in new attractions and activities, creating more of a lakefront nightlife and bringing in new live music and entertainment venues. The group indicated that casinos, outdoor activities, the Creole Nature Trail, festivals and culture make the area a unique travel destination. Other survey respondents were divided into four groups - residents; those primarily in the area for the casinos; those here on business; and those seeking other leisure activities. They were each asked about 50 questions and were routed to specific questions based on previous responses. It was noted that while leisure visitors hail from throughout the United States, the majority of casino visitors come from right next door in Texas. “We’re blessed to be near to such big markets,” said Manning. Respondents rated a list of activities and experiences that would appeal to them. There was some overlap among all groups. More live music venues were in the top five for all four groups. Manning said the CVB gets frequent requests by visitors to hear more Cajun and Zydeco bands. All four also placed lake excursions in their top five. A brewery or distillery also made all four lists. Every group but casino visitors indicated they’d like a farm-to-table dining experience and more walking and bike paths. Sulphur Mayor Chris Duncan said that much of what visitors are looking for can already be found in Sulphur. “Brimstone Museum and the Henning Cultural Center are going to continue to be a big draw for visitors to our area,” he said. “[But] we need more marketplaces, like the Sulphur Market, on Saturdays for local artisans to sell their crafts and handmade items.” Page 2 of 2 - Duncan said that attracting retail shopping outlets to Sulphur is difficult with a population below 50,000. “Everyone wants a bowling alley, movie theater, and more activities for children,” he said. “But this has to be done by the private sector. We are open for businesses, and I ask everyone to shop locally so that company marketers will see that we support local businesses.” The Lodging Market Analysis indicated that the high hotel/motel occupancy rate throughout the parish - 68 percent for West Calcasieu and 57 percent for East Calcasieu - will drive new hotel construction. The total room inventory for the parish, including hotels, motels and casinos, is 6,248. There are 22 hotels and motels and two casinos in West Calcasieu and 31 hotels and motels and two casinos in East Calcasieu. Some of the key conclusions about Southwest Louisiana, as reported in the study, include: • The area is a highly-rated destination among all segments; • Established markets are located within a five-hour radius; • Continued development of an active lakefront with lodging, meeting/event venues, attractions, dining, shopping and outdoor activities is highly desired; • Continued aggressive sales and marketing are required to compete with New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport-Bossier, Lafayette, Texas and Mississippi; • The Lake Charles/Southwest Louisiana CVB is well structured and extremely effective.
