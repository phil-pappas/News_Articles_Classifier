Potential feedstocks, or biologically based sources, that could be used to produce sustainable aviation biofuel in Japan include municipal solid waste, plant oils and animal fats, used cooking oil, algae, cellulosic biomass and residues from the wood products industry. Policy incentives promoting the introduction of next-generation aviation fuels are a prerequisite to success in aviation biofuel use.\nINAF was established in May 2014 with the aim of establishing a supply chain for next-generation aviation fuels in Japan. Its roadmap process assessed the entire biofuel supply chain, including procurement of raw materials, production of sustainable aviation fuel, blending biofuel with conventional petroleum jet fuel and how biofuel will be incorporated into an airport’s fueling infrastructure.\nAs part of Boeing’s commitment to protect the environment and support long-term sustainable growth for commercial aviation, the company has active biofuel projects on six continents, including in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Africa, China, Europe, Middle East andSoutheast Asia.\nSource:- Boeing\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Boeing Statement on 9 Air’s Commitment to Purchase 50 737s", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:14:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
