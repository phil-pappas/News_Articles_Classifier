The UK-based online travel agency first set up a business travel service in 2006. \nGreg Mannix, Lateroom’s head of corporate, said the move aimed to “raise the bar” in travel management. \n“After building up years of expertise in the corporate travel industry, we know exactly what these customers are looking for,” he said. \nFeatures to be offered as part of the first-phase launch include a new automated tool to help clients claim VAT expenses from hotel stays. \nThere will be a new account area allowing users to make online bookings, including access to corporate rates, and a summary section detailing all travel activity. Users can also set up a credit account that will be billed at the end of every month. \nLaterooms is offering discounts on parking and taxis for corporate clients through partnerships with suppliers such as NCP and Cabfind. \nMannix added that the new service would “streamline the corporate booking experience, and provide very significant cost savings for our clients”. \n“This first stage of improvements will pave the way for the full service launching later this year,” he added. \nLaterooms said that the full corporate travel service will include data analysis tools to enable the reporting and managing of budgets and spending, as well as providing management information data and a new rewards system for clients. \nThe OTA is currently up for sale after parent company TUI said in May that it wanted to “divest” LateRooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T14:47:23.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
