If you’re a reasonably observant person, you spend a good part of the day looking at the world around you. But what about the world below you? The most obvious thing to say about caving is that it takes place in the dark and involves squashing yourself into some pretty cramped places as you crawl through the earth’s lower reaches. Suffice it to say, this isn’t a pastime for the claustrophobic. It is one that can be enjoyed by people of varying degrees of fitness, though. And its appeal extends from adults to older children. As a result, you can enjoy a multi-generational caving expedition, bringing family and friends together for a shared experience that is by turns intense, challenging and exciting. Because it requires specialist equipment and knowledge, the best way to enjoy caving is in the company of an experienced guide. Many commercial outfits offer tours around well-known caves such as Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, with equipment and instruction provided. As an alternative, you could contact your local caving club, using the British Caving Association’s online directory. This will put you in touch with amateur cavers who like nothing better than inducting others into their subterranean adventures. The sense of danger is part of the appeal of caving, and it creates a surge of adrenaline When it comes to equipment, you’ll need a hard hat and a headlamp, which you can borrow or hire from a club or your caving instructor. You should wear warm clothes that you don’t mind getting mucky, and cover these with a waterproof layer or a boiler suit. It’s tempting to assume hiking boots would be the best option for your feet - but that couldn’t be further from the truth: the hooks they use for securing laces can easily snag on rocky seams, hindering progress and causing your joints to jar. Far better to choose a pair of wellingtons with non-slip soles. These offer protection from the damp, and you’ll never need to worry about them coming undone. If your caving expedition involves being lowered into the murky depths – an activity more accurately called “potholing” – you’ll probably also require a climbing harness, karabiner and ropes. That way, you’ll have all the gear needed to keep you out of harm’s way. Safety is an important consideration when caving, which is every bit as risky as rock climbing and abseiling. This sense of danger is part of the appeal, and creates a surge of adrenaline that stimulates old and young alike. For this reason, caving enthusiasts say their hobby is about more than entering the earth’s depths. They argue it’s about entering the depths of your being, too. For that reason, it’s the perfect way to see things from a new perspective, both literally and metaphorically.
