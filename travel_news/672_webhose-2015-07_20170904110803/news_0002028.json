(Doug Duran/Bay Area News Group) Related Stories Recipe: Festive Feta Appetizer Everyone knows about Livermore Valley's wine country, but its cozy downtown has become a foodie draw as well. Wine bars sparkle in Blacksmith Square and along the main drag. New bistros -- including The Last Word, barbecue-centric Sauced and pizza-focused Cravings and Patxi's -- woo passers-by. And mainstays such as Underdog, The Restaurant at Wente, Terra Mia and Zephyr Grill draw happy crowds. \nHere are two newcomers you may not have yet discovered. Artistic Table The vibe: Step inside Livermore's year-old bistro and gourmet marketplace and you're greeted by a wall of beer and wine -- 99 bottles of beer on the wall and hundreds more in stock, plus at least 200 wines in rotation. Settle in at the corrugated steel bar, topped with a cement counter, or take a seat at the communal table. The dining room of the Artistic Table restaurant is photographed in Livermore on June 18, 2015. Artistic Table is part retail beer, wine, cheese and specialty food store and part bistro. Owner Dana Kelebes serves up salads, panini and pizza. (Doug Duran/Bay Area News Group) Owner Dana Klebes, a metal artist, makes you feel welcome immediately. The 19th-century building's decor is both comfortable and sleek, with copper pendant lights, wood tables, bronze-toned bar chairs and local artwork. The dish: Everything here is made with local-as-possible ingredients, right down to the salad dressings, made with Olivina olive oil. Want to share? Try one of the generously sized salads, such as the light, lemony kale ($9) with pine nuts and Parmesan cheese, drizzled with a house-made citrus dressing, or our favorite, a colorful avocado and buttery hearts of palm ($10), served on a bed of greens with a creamy cilantro dressing.

We sampled the bacon, tomato and grilled cheese ($12), and a sweet-savory Vermonter ($12), maple syrup-spiked with goat, cheddar and shepherd cheeses. \nThe details: Open Tuesday-Sunday for lunch and dinner, happy hour 4-6 p.m. Tuesday-Friday. Enjoy brewery or winery events on Thursday evenings, and live music Friday and Saturday evenings. It's located at 56 S. Livermore Ave. Cheese Therapy Truck The vibe: On Thursdays evenings, Livermore's Carnegie Park bustles with farmers market vendors, happy shoppers and a handful of food trucks. There's always a line at the Cheese Therapy Truck, whose name reminds us of the 5-cent psychiatric help booth manned by Lucy in the \"Peanuts\" comic strip. Here Teri Tith Concannon and Denise Creek Garcia dole out cheese, instead of advice. \"Cheese literally makes people smile,\" says Garcia, Cheese Therapy's chef. \"Research shows it boosts endorphins.\" The dish: The short and sweet menu includes three-cheese Caesar salad ($7), which may be one of the best Caesars we've ever had. The Comt√©, Grafton Village cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano mixed with garlic and anchovy deliver a sharp flavor and texture punch. The domestic Plowman's box ($12 for three cheeses) is a full, savory meal with salumi, olives, creamy hummus, baguette slices and marinated veggies. Soup's always on -- and on the day of our visit, Garcia was ladling out a hearty roasted tomato and basil soup ($7). \nSay cheese: While you're waiting, Concannon tantalizes your taste buds with cheese samples. The truck stocks about 20 varieties for sale by the wedge, quarter, half or whole. Denise Creek Garcia, left, and Teri Concannon, owners of the Cheese Therapy truck, get their photo taken inside the truck at the Livermore Farmers Market in Livermore on June 18, 2015. Concannon and Garcia also take the truck to events and local wineries.
