Manuel Levonian general manager Crowne Plaza Resort Salalah said 'We are bracing for another successful season and expecting an increase in both national and international tourists.\n'Hopefully the booking window will expand in the coming few days. Till now the occupancy rate is looking good and we hope to sustain it during the Eid holidays as well.'\nShaddy Morgan assistant director sales Hilton Salalah Resort said one cannot just rely on advance bookings. 'Arab tourists are always last moment decision-makers and do not book in advance. We mostly get tourists from GCC states like Kuwait Saudi Arabia UAE and Qatar. Since a lot of schools are closed for vacations we are hoping to see a lot of families arriving on short-breaks.'\nSamer Khair general manager Salalah Marriott Resort said enquiries and bookings for the season started pouring in even before Ramadan. 'We see a growth in the number of travellers visiting Salalah year after year. Local guests start checking for rates and packages for the season even before Ramadan starts while most GCC travellers plan their trip to Salalah during khareef season. 'We even partner with corporates and associations and offer special rates and packages for their staff and customers. We have different packages depending on the groups and guests can book online' Khair said.\nAnother major factor that is expected to boost tourism this season is the opening of the new Salalah Airport said hotel operators. Meanwhile an official from the Directorate General of Meteorology said 'The temperature in Salalah is expected to drop to 18 to 20C in the coming days.' This means that more people will be heading towards the hills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:55:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
