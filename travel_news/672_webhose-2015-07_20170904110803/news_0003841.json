Kennedy for GPTMC Visitors at a specially marked storytelling bench at the National Memorial Arch at the… more A local tourism agency is boasting record numbers‚ including the number of hotel room nights, after it underwent a few changes to increase visitation, spearheaded by an agency-wide rebranding. The Valley Forge Tourism & Convention Board last year rebranded itself , which included a new name and new marketing campaigns, all with the goal of increasing visitation to the area and to expose it to a wider audience. The fruits of the labor seem to be very sweet. Since the rebranding, and with fiscal year 2014/2015 concluded, the tourism agency formerly known as the Valley Forge Convention and Visitors Bureau saw an 845 percent increase in visitation to its website since fiscal 2014, according to the agency. The agency now has more than 40,000 followers across all social media channels, up nearly 120 percent. Perhaps one of the most important effects the rebranding has had on the area is the increase in hotel room nights, or \"heads in beds\" — something an area's hospitality industry strives to attract versus the tourism visitors that visit just for the day. Since the rebranding, Valley Forge Tourism & Convention Board's sales department exceeded its hotel room night goal by more than 522 rooms, surpassing fiscal 2014 results for a total of 93,522 total room nights, according to the agency. The rebranding launched last summer had a direct impact on the momentum the agency is experiencing and continues to build on, spokesman Edward Harris said. \"The development of the new Valley Forge Sports Commission, a lift in room nights coming from the corporate market, as well as compression from Philadelphia also contributed to the results,\" he said. Despite the success, the agency isn't sitting still. \"Efforts are continuing to ensure that 2015/2016 is equally as impressive and successful,\" President Mike Bowman said. Bowman, who became president last month, said the top priority would be the World Meeting of Families and Pope Francis' visit this September, where he will be visiting with bishops at the St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pa., on Sept. 27. The agency last April launched a website dedicated to Pope Francis' visit and has since attracted more than 3,000 site visits, the agency said. \"Beyond that, we are working on initiatives to increase the number of brides who choose Montgomery County as a wedding destination and the number of sporting tournaments we draw to our area, all in an effort to spark those overnight stays that are so vital to our economic impact,\" Bowman said. \nWant Philadelphia Travel news in your inbox?
