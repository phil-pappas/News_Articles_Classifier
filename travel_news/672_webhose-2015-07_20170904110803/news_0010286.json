Now the largest luxury consumer watch fair, SalonQP was founded in 2003 and acquired by Telegraph Media Group in 2013. Now in its seventh year, in 2014 the event attracted over 7,000 guests who were able to browse and buy watches from over 80 exhibiting brands. These included Nomos , the cult German brand; Bonhoff , an independent brand run by German engineer Hannes Bonoff, who made his debut at Salon QP with two new inventions; and the exciting water-powered watches of HYT . • Highlights of Salon QP 2014 Brands confirmed to attend this year include A. Lange & Söhne , which has its watchmaking roots in the 1100s; Tudor and Romaine Jerome , famous for incorporating recovered steel from the Titanic and volcano lava into their watches. Salon regulars such as Chopard , Bremont , Grönefeld and MB&F will also be returning. Had enough watches? The Salon will also play host to luxury cars (a new exhibition this year examines the relationship between cars and watches), cocktail bars (last year Chivas Regal whisky created the English Quaich cocktail – whisky, sherry, apple juice and ginger ale), craft demonstrations, piano recitals and watch service bars. Another exhibition, Inside a Second, will look at the chronographs of Switzerland's Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie , a cultural council of 42 members founded in 2005. The FHH's job is to share information and technical expertise about Swiss watchmaking, which has a huge international market - more than 95 per cent of production is exported and sold outside Switzerland.
