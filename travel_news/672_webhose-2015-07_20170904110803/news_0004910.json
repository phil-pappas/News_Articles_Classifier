The flight made an emergency landing, without loss of life. Flights on Southwest Airlines were immediately canceled in the wake of the incident until every 737 in their fleet could be examined for any potential safety issues.\nSouthwest Airlines is currently trying to determine the cause of the gaping hole in one of its airplanes that was tweeted and emailed about as it occurred during a flight between Phoenix and Sacramento.\nThe incident could have seemed like an April Fool's prank, as it happened on Friday, April 1, 2011 on a routine flight between Phoenix and Sacramento. The plane quickly lost pressure and plummetted from approximately 36,000 feet to 10,000 feet in minutes. The flight was diverted to Yuma, Arizona. 118 passengers and 5 crew were on board.\nSouthwest Airlines released the following regarding the incident - Preliminary reports indicated the aircraft lost pressure and oxygen masks were deployed shortly after takeoff from Phoenix. After the plane landed safely in Yuma, the crew confirmed a hole in the top of the aircraft, approximately mid-cabin. One flight attendant was treated at the scene for a minor injury, as was at least one passenger. No injuries required transport to the hospital.\nSouthwest Airlines stated that 118 passengers on board Flight 812 have received a full refund along with an apology and two complimentary roundtrip passes on Southwest for future travel.\nThe airline reports that it is working with both the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to figure out the cause of the hole in the airplane during flight.\nSouthwest Airlines is further assessing the damage to the aircraft and is inspecting 79 of its Boeing 737 to look for any signs of aircraft skin fatigue.\nHundreds of flights have been canceled, and expect delays until the inspections are fully completed.\nThe airline strongly advises passengers to check their flight status on southwest.com in the wake of this incident, and for rebooking in the case of canceled flights.", "external_links": ["http://www.southwest.com/flight/flight-status-select.html"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:06:18.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
