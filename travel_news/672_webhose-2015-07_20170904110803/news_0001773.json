Visitors can do that and more during the Novato Space Festival, sponsored by the city’s Space Station Museum . Apollo 15 astronaut Al Worden and space shuttle astronauts Jerry Ross , Yvonne Cagle , Rhea Seddon , Hoot Gibson and Don Bursch will be on hand to answer questions. Bursch and several other astronauts serve on the board of advisers for the museum, which boasts one of the largest collections of space artifacts, such as a Soviet-era cosmonaut flight suit, International Space Station equipment, a space shuttle hatch, photos and models. (The lunar module and moon buggy are replicas.) \nVitals: Aug. 1, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. Pacheco Plaza, 464 Ignacio Blvd., Novato.

Though the emphasis is on merchandise, there’s also plenty of food, live entertainment and leisurely walks along Morro Bay Boulevard, just a few blocks from the ocean and views of that iconic rock. Aug. 2, 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Free.
