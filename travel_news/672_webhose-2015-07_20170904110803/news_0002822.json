when work will stop - more than 126,000 visitors, athletes, officials and media are expected to descend on the Gold Coast. \nThe expansion will be on the southern edge of the Gold Coast Airport at Tugun. \nThe Gold Coast Airport's master plan for the upgrade says the airport is already two \"air-bridge stands\" short of what is needed to meet the passenger capacity in peak hour. \n\"Recent investigations have found that currently, the apron peak hour capacity is exceeded with a shortfall of two stands in the busy hour,\" the report says. \n\"By 2018, if no action is taken, this will be increased to a shortfall of three stands. \n\"The associated impacts in 2018 are that either two international aircraft - or four domestic aircraft - will not be able to be accommodated in the busy hour, impacting up to 374,000 passengers annually.\" Ad Feedback \nWork will begin in early 2016 - once Federal Government approval is received - to build the first three of the five new air bridges and the new three-story terminal building. \nThis stage will be substantially completed in late 2017, before the Commonwealth Games which begins in April 2018. \nGold Coast Airport's chief operating officer David Collins said flights into the airport were increasing and the upgrade crucial to cope with the growth. \n\"In recent years, Gold Coast Airport has experienced high rates of growth due to an increase in low cost and full service carrier airlines, both domestically and internationally,\" Collins said. \n\"Recent investigations have found the capacity of aircraft parking stands is currently exceeded at peak times, and if no action is taken to provide additional aircraft parking by 2018 access to the airport would need to be restricted,\" he said. \n\"This could significantly impact the airport's ability to service future domestic and international passenger demand.\" \nHe said the construction would be divided into two time frames. \n\"Stage one will commence early 2016, and includes the site preparation, vegetation clearing, drainage realignment, three new aircraft parking stands and terminal redevelopment,\" he said. \n\"That's due for completion in late 2017. \n\"Stage two will start in late 2020, and includes an additional two aircraft parking stands, and that's due to be finished in early 2021.\" \nThe plans have been released for public comment and the Federal Government will make a decision early in 2016. \nThe construction work will create about 230 full-time jobs. \nQueensland Airports Limited managing director Dennis Chant said after the expansion, a further 180 jobs would be required. \n\"Importantly, the region will benefit through the creation of more than 230 full-time jobs during stage one of construction, while an additional 180 direct full-time workers will be required for ongoing operations.\" \nGold Coast Airport expansion in brief \n· Located south of the existing terminal at Tugun; \n· A three-level extension southward from the existing terminal building; \n· Four aerobridges to be built; \n· Five additional wide-bodied aircraft parking stands with associated taxiways; \n· Provides additional capacity to cater for aviation forecasts up to 2023; \n· Will make travel faster and more efficient, with broader retail choice; \n· Improved service for more than 5.8 million passengers per year; \n· Stage one commences in early 2016. -
