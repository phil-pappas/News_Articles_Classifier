They can have a partner or maybe just want to make a new friend. I’m more than happy for them to stay somewhere else, too. I’d just like someone to get a free ticket and not let it go to waste.”\nTo contact Ms Swanepoel email sudevidasi@gmail.com.\nAN ICY WAY TO START THE DAY\nOriginally published as Free trip if you share name with ex", "external_links": ["http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/ocean-grove-icebergers-brave-freezing-conditions-for-adrenaline-rush/story-fnjuhovy-1227454063443", "http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/grovedale-woman-offers-free-trip-if-your-name-is-ben-mccartney/story-fnjuhovy-1227457564822"], "published": "2015-07-27T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T01:58:07.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
