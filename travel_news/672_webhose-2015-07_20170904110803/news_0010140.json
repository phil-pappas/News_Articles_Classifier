The grand reopening is scheduled for Sunday. \nThe center was originally built as bachelor officer's quarters by the U.S. Army in 1909 and served a variety of purposes before being made into a visitor center. \nExhibits and displays inside the center also received a makeover. \nThink your friends should see this?
