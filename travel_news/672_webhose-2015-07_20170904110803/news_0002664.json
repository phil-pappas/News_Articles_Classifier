PUBLISHED: 07:37, Sat, Jul 18, 2015 | UPDATED: 08:14, Sat, Jul 18, 2015 GETTY Dresden in Germany But as cruise lines continue their constant search for new itineraries they are beginning to give this river serious attention. The source of the River Elbe is in the Czech Republic but apart from Prague most of the important destinations are in Germany. At around 700 miles long it flows into the North Atlantic 55 miles from Hamburg, Germany’s most important port. But most river cruises on the Elbe start or finish in Berlin or Prague, exploring some of the eastern cities beyond Berlin. Here are six of the best cities and towns along the Elbe: Berlin: Now regarded as one of the coolest cities in the world, there are dozens of sights to see, but the Berlin Wall Memorial and Documentation Centre is a must and includes a surviving section of the wall and a watchtower. You’ll need a photo of the Brandenburg Gate, one of the old city gates built in 1791, and many people flock to the Reichstag – the government building. But if it’s museums you want then head to Museum Island, UNESCO-listed and home to an incredible collection of art and treasure including the Pergamon Museum – regarded as the German equivalent of the British Museum in London. Prague: A mix of superb Gothic, Renaissance and Boroque architecture, but with a 21st century buzz, the Czech Republic is a dazzling destination. Top of the must-see list is Charles Bridge, lined with statues, which links the Old Town to the Lesser Town. The Old Town’s Jewish Quarter dates from the 13th century and the nearby 12th century Town Square has a fantastic astronomical clock. Over the river is Prague Castle, a massive complex of palaces, museums, galleries and churches. And don’t miss Wenceslas Square, the main centre for shops, bars and restaurants.
