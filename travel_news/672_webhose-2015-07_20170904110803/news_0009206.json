I love her. What an athlete, what a role model, what a woman! — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) July 11, 2015 15.52 Serena: \"I can't believe I'm standing here with another Serena Slam... I heard the I love yous, I love you more\" pic.twitter.com/h7QG0tt0Zr — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 11, 2015 listen to ‘Serena Williams speaks to Sue Barker after her Wimbledon triumph’ on audioBoom 15.46 Serena's grin is as wide as ever. Sue Barker is finally permitted to broach the subject of the Serena Slam: I didn't even know it was over! She'll be holding this trophy very soon, believe me. I can't believe I'm standing here with another Serena Slam...there was definitely a little pressure towards the end, I just thought \"stay out here, do the best you can...\" Here's how Henman Hill reacted to Serena's triumph: listen to ‘The hill as Serena Williams clinches the Wimbledon title’ on audioBoom 15.44 Muguruza summons some words for the BBC: I love to play in big courts - a Grand Slam final is a dream come true! 15.43 The green carpet is unfurled and the ballboys and girls assemble in double-quick time. His Royal Highness The Duke of Kent, President of The All England Lawn Tennis Club, is on court for the presentations. Garbine Muguruza, who's sealed a top 10 place with her performances here, receives her runner-up trophy with tears in her eyes, but Centre Court rises to appreciate her contribution to a final that could have raced away from her after an encouraging start. Here comes the champion, though - and this is her TWENTY-FIRST Grand Slam title - and she gleefully receives the Venus Rosewater Dish. Serena Williams beats Garbine Muguruza 6-4, 6-4! Muguruza, somehow , has the opportunity to serve her way back into this match. She starts with a double fault, and a tiny piece of the collective Centre Court heart breaks. Serena, via a cruel net cord and with Muguruza scrambling valiantly, gets to 0-30. Muguruza's fairytale seems to have reached its final page - she goes long on the forehand. Championship point! Muguruza sends a forehand wide and Centre Court erupts....eventually. There's some inexplicable confusion at first, but Serena Williams is the Wimbledon champion for the sixth time! Williams 6-4, 5-4 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) I optimistically place an asterisk next to Muguruza's name for the next service game, but Serena's double-faulted again. Muguruza earns an ovation from Centre Court - and Williams - with a backhand across court: 0-30! Could she? Will she? She might! A forehand return skids across court for three break points! Serena takes us to Aceville to keep the suspense going. The second break point is sent long. The third? Another ace down the middle. This match summed up in a single game. Serena serves up her twelfth ace, for Championship point . But Muguruza digs so, so deep to deny her! Great stuff, and a superb forehand on to the left tramline. Serena goes long - another break point for Muguruza! The Spaniard's next shot is agonisingly long: deuce. After a rally that seems to last a century, Serena nets again! Fantastic salvage effort from Muguruza there. Break point number five - and she buries it into the corner! There's life in this final yet... Williams* 6-4, 5-3 Muguruza (*denotes next server) What does Muguruza have left to offer this final? Serena's taken her eye off the ball, in any case, and it's suddenly 30-0. Muguruza is pinned back, though, and can only hook a forehand wide. Out flies another Williams forehand, after some gutsy rallying from Muguruza, but the next return is clobbered back from whence it came for 40-30. Muguruza finds the net with a backhand as Serena waits at the net: deuce. Muguruza serves big for the advantage and forces another wayward Serena forehand to stay in this match. Williams 6-4, 5-2 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Muguruza finally finds a counter-punch, and then Serena double faults to keep this interesting: 0-30. Muguruza's playing like it's 2pm! Serena goes long for 0-40 and three break points for the Spaniard . She only needs one of those, but still needs a miracle to prevent the seemingly inevitable here. Williams* 6-4, 5-1 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Serena, now free to roam from the baseline as Muguruza's resistance dissolves, thumps a backhand down the line and then a forehand to the corner: 30-0. Muguruza goes long with a backhand, Serena has three break points , and she only needs one. Williams has won the last 12 points, and this match has utterly disintegrated as a contest. Williams 6-4, 4-1 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Williams confirms her dominant position in this final with an ace down the middle to start, and Muguruza can only block the next serve long. Serena's tenth ace brings a helpless smile from Muguruza, and it's an emphatic hold of serve. Williams* 6-4, 3-1 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Muguruza can't stoop enough to pick up a Serena backhand - 15-all - and her backhand can't find the corner on the next point. The first signs of the Spaniard running out of steam appear with a forehand into the net: two break points to Williams . The forehand runs aground at the net again, and Serena takes a step closer to the title. Williams 6-4, 2-1 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Seventh ace from Serena: 15-0. Fifth double fault from Serena: 15-all. And a sixth! Glimpse of a chance for Muguruza here, but Williams goes big on a second serve. Muguruza nets her next return on the forehand side, but a Serena forehand ends a baseline exchange by sailing long: deuce. Ace number eight atones for that - adv. Williams - and Muguruza can't get hold of the next one. Not the most straightforward hold of serve in Serena's career. Here's the sound of Serena securing set one: listen to ‘Serena Williams takes the first set ’ on audioBoom Williams* 6-4, 1-1 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Muguruza isn't taking a backwards step, though - she's 40-0 up in a flash - and a towering serve wraps up the hold. Williams 6-4, 1-0 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Two huge serves on the way to a confident hold of serve from Williams - Muguruza isn't going to have it quite as easy as the start of the first, which doesn't bode well for her chances. Serena Williams wins the first set 6-4! Serena's started to get the measure of the Muguruza serve - a ruthless backhand into the corner confirms that. Still the 21-year-old advances, and this time Williams can't respond on the stretch. A Muguruza forehand is well off-target, though, and it's 15-30. Pressure . She doesn't hide, however - another shot on to the baseline forces Serena into an error, and a third ace of the match puts Muguruza ahead 40-30. Her backhand malfunctions for deuce, and a double fault gives Serena a set point! Muguruza stays aggressive, but Serena can match that - a forehand is comfortably in the left corner and Serena - after a shocking start - has taken the first set. Williams 5-4 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Muguruza thinks she's got away with a lucky net cord, but Williams steps in to thump a decisive backhand on to the baseline. Serena double-faults again - \"It's OK!\" she assures herself - but Muguruza's returns aren't as pinpoint as they were in the first game: 30-15. Serena slams an overhead almost into the Royal Box - David Beckham presumably was poised to deal with it - but an errant forehand lets Muguruza back in at 40-30. Serena's at the net to power home a backhand, and now Muguruza must serve to stay in the first set. Williams* 4-4 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Next test of Muguruza's big-game mentality. She takes the first point, and looks to have got the upper hand in the next, only to opt to go to the Williams forehand when the empty right corner was beckoning: 15-all. Muguruza goes long, and Serena senses a chance. Muguruza goes long again - two break points for Williams . An ace out wide from the Spaniard, but she can't convert a forehand and Williams breaks back! Williams 3-4 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Ace from Williams, a Muguruza return into the net, and a \"COME ON!\" from Serena. It's soon 40-0, as Muguruza can only offer up an overhead volley for Williams, and a huge serve is enough to hold. Williams* 2-4 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Serena hammers a forehand return down the line - Muguruza doesn't even consider chasing that. The Spaniard is decisive on the next point, with a thunderous forehand into the left corner, but Serena finds an answer to the next and Muguruza goes long to give Williams two break points . Muguruza saves the first, superbly, by carving out the opportunity for a forehand into the right corner. A brutal serve down the middle takes care of the second break point: deuce. Serena stretches for the next, but she nets, and Muguruza belts a serve out wide to secure the hold. This is seriously bold stuff from the youngster. Williams 2-3 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Serena's mini-resurgence continues with an ace, and Muguruza hits her next return wildly off-target, but Serena sends a forehand of her own long. Muguruza does the same for 40-15, and Williams secures another restorative hold with a big serve. Williams* 1-3 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Muguruza serves from below the Royal Box - Williams' forehand finds its radar for the return into the corner, but the Spaniard whips a backhand down the line on the next point. A first ace for Muguruza: 30-15. Serena races into the net to put away a forehand beyond the long reach of her opponent, but the next return is long: 40-30. Much better from Williams now, though - she forces Muguruza into the corner, and dispatches the volley at the net with total authority. It's advantage Muguruza next - a Serena return finds the net - and the Spaniard holds serve again. Williams 1-2 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Wonderfully aggressive returning from Muguruza, straight back into the body of Williams. It's 0-30 next, after Serena whips a cross-court forehand wide, but Muguruza sends a backhand return long. Two huge serves - and some vocal self-admonishment from Serena - restore some order and Muguruza goes long on the backhand again - Williams is on the scoreboard. Williams* 0-2 Muguruza (*denotes next server) Muguruza hesitates on a second serve, but there's no sign of nerves - Williams can't get it back. Serena does get hold of the next return for 15-all, but Muguruza pins her back for 40-15. The Spaniard can't get around a backhand enough on the next point, and she finds the net cord. Yet another Williams forehand flies over the baseline, though, and the upstart has made a dream start. Williams 0-1 Muguruza* (*denotes next server) Williams gets the 2015 final under way with a double fault! Centre Court murmurs. Serena races onto a spooned return from Muguruza to level it up with a smash into the next postcode, and follows that with a 118mph ace. A brief baseline exchange ends with a Williams forehand into the right corner for 40-15, but the Spaniard makes her stretch on the next point and an under-pressure backhand is wide. Another double fault! Not a tremendous start for Serena. Another double fault and break point Muguruza! The second serve is just about big enough to keep Serena on the front foot and Muguruza nets to bring it back to deuce. It's advantage Muguruza again though, after a belting forehand return, but again she can't capitalise. The 21-year-old outsider hammers a backhand down the middle, which Serena can't get hold of, for a third break point - once again, it can't be converted into anything more. Serena goes long on the forehand into the corner - it's break point number 4 after eight minutes. Williams overcooks another one, and this time Muguruza breaks! What. A. Start. 14.06 Silence momentarily descends on Centre Court as the two players thwock their way through the warm-up, before the hubbub gently returns. 14.05 Serena Williams wins the toss and has chosen to serve. 14.02 Here they are! 13.59 Muguruza dawdles in the corridor beneath Centre Court as Williams remains in the dressing room. Wimbledon protocol dictates they must wait a few more moments... 13.50 This is your ten-minute warning. Williams and Muguruza will be making this walk to Centre Court shortly... 13.43 Williams' last interview with the BBC before today's final is a serene affair, even if they're not allowed to broach the subject of securing that clean sweep of the majors: I'm in a good place in my life...I'm living my dream. 13.28 Our man Daniel Schofield summed up Serena's refusal to discuss the potential completion of her slam thus: Refusing to acknowledge it, however, does not make it any less real. Since Serena kicked things off at the US Open in 1999, the Williams sisters' conveyor belt of success has been punctuated briefly by the likes of Lindsay Davenport, Maria Sharapova and - most effectively perhaps - Justine Henin, but the Williams surname dominates - they've won 48% of the majors between them over the last sixteen years: 13.23 Your thoughts, hopes and dreams for this match to adam.hurrey@telegraph.co.uk , please. 13.17 David Law's Tennis Podcast looks back on the superlative action from Friday and previews this weekend's finals: The podcasters' predictions for this afternoon? David Law: Williams in 2 Catherine Whitaker: Williams in 3 Simon Briggs: Williams in 3 13.10 Standing in the way of that potential Centre Court dance routine, the third chapter of the historic Serena Slam , and Williams' 21st major title, is 21-year-old Garbine Muguruza . Here's how the two finalists match up, courtesy of the WTA: They've only met three times, but there's plenty to take from that embryonic rivalry. After Serena cruised past a teenage Muguruza at the Australian open in 2013, the Spaniard took three sets in a row off the living legend - including that comprehensive upset at Roland Garros last year. Serena got her revenge back in Melbourne this year, but had to come back from a set down to do it. Wimbledon is well and truly Serena's turf, though. 13.02 Good afternoon! The bookies are offering odds of 1/5 of seeing something like this within the next few hours: Like she was gonna lose. pic.twitter.com/0lbRxQ5iXt — Master Tesfatsion (@MasterStrib) June 6, 2015 11.15 Serena Williams has revenge on her mind as the world number one aims to end the fairytale run of Garbine Muguruza in the Wimbledon final on Saturday . Williams was plunged into a prolonged bout of soul-searching after an embarrassing 6-2, 6-2 thrashing against Muguruza in the French Open second round last year. That humbling loss forced her to reevaluate her game and the 33-year-old American's response has been blistering. Determined to reassert her superiority, Williams has since won three of the four available Grand Slam titles. And in a fitting twist, she has the opportunity to make amends for her Paris pain when she takes on Muguruza for just the second time since their meeting at Roland Garros. \"It was an eye-opening loss for me. Some losses you're angry about, and some losses you learn from. That loss I think I learned the most from in a long time,\" Serena said. \"I got so much better after that loss. It was really an experience that helped me say, Okay, Serena, you want to be the best, you're going to have to do certain things and you're going to have to improve certain things.\" As if winning the sixth Wimbledon title and 21st major of her career wouldn't be enough to underline Williams' credentials as one of the all-time greats, she has a slew of other milestones within reach in her 25th Grand Slam final. After demolishing Maria Sharapova to move into her eighth Wimbledon final, Serena, who has a remarkable 38-1 record in 2015, is just one victory away from holding all four major titles at the same time - a rare feat she last achieved in 2002-03. A win over surprise finalist Muguruza would also make her the first woman to land the French Open and Wimbledon back-to-back since she last achieved the double in 2002. Perhaps most significantly, lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time since 2012 would leave Serena needing only to defend the US Open to become the first woman since Steffi Graf in 1988 to claim a calendar Grand Slam. But rather than dwell on those legacy-defining possibilities, Williams made it clear the only reason she is in such a privileged position is because she no longer frets about her place in the pantheon of tennis greats. \"I don't want the pressure of that. It's been okay just to free my brain,\" she said. Serena Williams is firm favourite to win another Wimbledon title Williams is heavily favoured to defeat Muguruza, a Grand Slam final debutant who has just one tour-level title compared to Serena's 67. But the superstitious world number 20, who has banned her parents from flying in from Barcelona for the final, has emerged as a future star over the last fortnight. Muguruza's tense three-set win over Polish 13th seed Agnieszka Radwanska in the last four made her the first Spanish woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in 1996. Conchita Martinez was the last Spanish women's champion in 1994. And Muguruza, Venezuela-born and Barcelona-raised, says beating Serena in Paris and pushing her to three sets before losing in the Australian Open this year, shows she has no reason to fear the American. \"Roland Garros will help me a lot because every time you play these important matches, you feel, 'Okay, I've been here before. I know what I have to do',\" the 21-year-old said. \"To have Serena in the Wimbledon final is the hardest match you can have. \"But if you want to win a Grand Slam, when you dream, you say, I want (to beat) Serena in the final.\" Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T18:54:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
