Possible abnormal behavior that could indicate imminent earthquakes includes chickens flying atop trees, fish leaping out of water or toads moving in a group, it added.\nNanjing plans to recruit seven more farms into the scheme this year, it said. Facilities need to house more than three species to be eligible.\nBut some animal keepers seemed reluctant to become involved.\n“Our zoo is not being transformed into a monitor station because the animals will display abnormal behavior when they are teased by visitors,” the report Quote: d a local zookeeper as saying.\nUsing animals to predict earthquakes is not new in China. State-run media said last year that the central city of Nanchang was using dogs to predict tremors.\nChina is regularly hit by seismic incidents, with hundreds of thousands killed in major disasters in the past. Three people died in the latest fatal earthquake last week, in the far western region of Xinjiang.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:07:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
