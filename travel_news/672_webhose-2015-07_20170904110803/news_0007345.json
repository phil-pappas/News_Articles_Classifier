Following the success of last year’s inaugural event, the company has announced its attendance for the second consecutive year at the ‘New Generation of Airline Passenger Systems’ conference in London, on 29 & 30 September 2015. \nCodeGen is the developer of the innovative TravelBox™ technology, a specialist high end product, used globally by major tour operators and increasingly gaining a reputation for quality and excellence within the airline sector. CodeGen’s pioneering technology, which also aids businesses in the development of their strategic technology development, has the ability to work alongside established passenger systems and allows other products and services to be seamlessly added to the airline’s booking flow. Any product can be provided for, with typical add-ons including seat selection, baggage payments, car hire, transfers, hotels and insurance. This packaging technology – dubbed ‘smart packaging’ by CodeGen – can either allow airlines to sell extras, as included in one package price, or identify ancillary and merchandising opportunities. Bharat Patel, president, sales, marketing and commercial, CodeGen, explains: “Our technology works particularly well for airlines seeking a partner to help them offer more options as part of a flight package. As a business at the forefront of travel technology, we are constantly developing and evolving our systems to provide a comprehensive service for businesses across the travel industry and are currently in ongoing discussions with a number of aviation brands regarding the enhancement of their existing offering”. Members of the CodeGen team participating at the New Generation of Airline Passenger Systems conference include Bharat Patel, president, sales marketing and commercial, and commercial director, Tim Wright. Further aviation sector technology experts from CodeGen will also be on hand for delegates to meet during the two day event. Designed specifically for the travel and aviation industries, CodeGen’s TravelBox™ is a complete end-to-end technology solution that enables incremental bookings and revenue generation as well as automating business processes, everything from inventory to costing and pricing, documentation and even communication and accounts. Fully scalable to suit any size of operation, TravelBox™ is a quality product that provides the established host of many large travel organisations worldwide, and is capable of supporting the most complex and demanding workflows in the global travel industry.
