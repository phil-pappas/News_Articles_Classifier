The data highlights how self-identified \"travel geeks\" travel more, take more spontaneous trips and save more money than other US trip-takers. It also highlights behaviors that all US consumers can adopt in order to get more out of their travel experiences. \n\"Confidence seems like a big factor in getting the most out of travel,\" says Hotwire CEO Henrik Kjellberg. \"Our survey data demonstrates that self-proclaimed 'travel geeks' are much more comfortable navigating the travel landscape, but their specific travel practices are things everyone can adopt. So we're encouraging everyone to embrace their own inner 'travel geek.'\" \nAccording to the survey results, there are some consistent things that US travel geeks do more often than the general population. These include: \n• Search regularly for deals on travel and accommodation \n• Book spontaneous or last minute travel in order to take advantage of travel deals \n• Maximize loyalty programs like frequent flyer miles and hotel points \n• Use vacation days to see new places, instead of getting paid out for the days they do not use \n• Use online discount websites to book travel \n\"We're truly a collection of travel geeks ourselves,\" Kjellberg said. \"We love to go places, we love to explore. We love to learn. We love finding out about places. That's why we all work here—because we're travel geeks and we want to share information with other enthusiastic travelers.\" \nOf the 18 percent of survey respondents who identified as \"travel geeks,\" millennials were the most prevalent at 27 percent for males and 19 percent for females ages 18-34. Students said they are generally more eager to get out and travel as well, with 24 percent identifying themselves as travel geeks. \nThe survey was conducted online within the United States between June 19-23, 2015 among 2,024 adults ages 18 and older by Harris Poll", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T05:20:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
