It’s no wonder the Brisbane Lions of 2001-04 are considered the greatest team of the modern era, and one of the best of all time.\nDo they have a challenger in the 2015 Hawks? Sydney coach John Longmire says yes.\nWHICH IS THE GREATEST TEAM OF THE MODERN ERA? VOTE BELOW\n“We’re looking at a team this week that has won the last two premierships and beat the team that is on top of the ladder by 72 points without Jarryd Roughead,” Longmire said on Wednesday.\n“This is a team that is comparable to Brisbane in the early 2000s, maybe even North Melbourne in the 1990s.”\nHEAD TO HEAD: FOX FOOTY RATES HAWKS V LIONS\nHawthorn has won back-to-back flags and three in the past seven years, plus a narrow loss to the Swans in the 2012 decider.\nThe Hawks are favourites to record their own three-peat this year and are simply awesome in full flight. But should they be in the same conversation as the all-conquering Lions team featuring Michael Voss, Simon Black, Jason Akermanis, Jonathan Brown and Alastair Lynch, to mention a few?\nOther contenders for the “greatest team of the modern era” title are the Kangaroos’ 1996 and 1999 premiership team, which was overrun by Adelaide in the 1998 decider, and the Cats of 2007-14 who played in eight straight finals series bagging flags in 2008, 08 and 2011 and going down to the Hawks on the last day in September 2008.\nMeanwhile, Longmire expects his veteran fullback Ted Richards to play on Saturday after he missed last week’s win over Brisbane because of concussion.\nWhich is the greatest team of the modern era?\nOriginally published as Are Hawks up with 2001-03 Lions?", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/8980447/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/8980447.js", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/hawthorn-ranks-up-with-brisbane-lions-of-2001-03-says-john-longmire/story-fni5f8ge-1227443099889"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:21:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
