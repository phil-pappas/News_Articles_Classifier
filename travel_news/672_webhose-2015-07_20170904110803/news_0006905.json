Almost embarrassed, the Swiss maestro surged menacingly to the net on the following point to clinch victory with a slashing volley.\nFederer said two rain delays worked in his favour.\n“It’s never easy for either player, plus it was quite windy out there,” the grand slam record-holder said.\n“The stop and goes are not easy for either player. I think the breaks actually helped rather than hindered me. I was able to stay in front and reset well.”\nSwitzerland's Roger Federer same the rain worked in his favour.

It was extremely tough out there,” he said.\n“I changed my return position a few times to help myself and make him think about it a little bit. It was difficult with the rain delays. I hope I can get to another final, but it will be tough.”\nFederer had not lost to Simon since 2008, winning five straight matches — and there was no danger of the sequence ending on Wimbledon grass.\nRoger Federer has not lost to Gilles Simon since 2008.

He quickly redeemed himself in the following game and was serving for the set a second time, only to foiled by the return of the rain.\nNeeding only three points to move to a two sets to love gap, Federer moved in for the kill by breaking Simon’s delivery in the third game of the third set.\nSensing Simon’s waning spirit, Federer broke again in the seventh game before securing victory after 95 minutes.\nWatched by Prince William and Princess Kate, David Beckham and assorted tennis royalty, Murray jumped to a 3-1 lead after Pospisil blundered on serve in the third game.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Bear Grylls cheer on Andy Murray.
