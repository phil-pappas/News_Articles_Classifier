But Britain has so much more to offer, from the Cornish Riviera to the Scottish Highlands and everything in between. \n\"For many areas tourism is a key industry bringing jobs, growth and security for working people. Tourism supports almost one in 10 jobs in the UK and we want to rebalance the economy to make sure this boost is felt right across the country.\" \nMinisters from across government will sit on the committee overseeing the five-point plan, which focuses on better collaboration between organisations, boosting skills and jobs, \"common sense\" regulation, transport and improved border services. \nMr Whittingdale said: \"Tourism is a vital industry that brings jobs and growth to local economies across Britain. There are so many world-class things to see and do in the UK, and we need to make sure visitors are experiencing as many of them as possible.\" \nTourism was worth nearly Â£60 billion directly to the economy last year and nearly one in 10 jobs are estimated to be in tourism-related industries, according to the Government. \nThe plan sets out ways to make visiting the country easier by streamlining and improving the visa regime \"while retaining a robust migration system that protects the UK from immigration abuse\". \nMore work will be done with border staff to make sure \"all passengers are processed efficiently, and with a smile\", it adds. \nInfrastructure schemes that make travelling around Britain easier will be encouraged and work will be done with train companies to improve journeys for tourists. \nSally Balcombe, chief executive at VisitBritain, said: \"International tourism is the UK's third largest service export and delivers economic benefits right across Britain - including jobs. We are one of the most diverse destinations in the world, so it's excellent news that there will be a renewed emphasis on delivering jobs and growth to our nations and regions, with VisitBritain at the heart of this activity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T11:08:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
