The airline will suspend the unprofitable four roundtrip flights per week from Bangkok to Los Angeles and from Bangkok to Rome, starting October 25, Thai Airways President Jarumporn Chotikasathein said in a statement. He said the two routes \"failed to meet every criterion\" for viability including their 10-year performance, market potential and the number of connecting passengers. State-owned Thai Airways cancelled its non-stop flights from Bangkok to Los Angeles in 2012, adding a layover in Seoul. Four years earlier, the airline called off its non-stop service to New York. Services on profitable routes to London and Frankfurt will be doubled to 14 flights per week, Jarumporn said. He said the flight schedule changes and other measures were being introduced after the state-owned carrier entered a rehabilitation plan earlier this year. Its losses have swelled in recent years. The carrier posted a net loss of 15.6 billion baht ($445 million) last year, about 30 percent higher than 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:52:35.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
