It alleges that the administration unconstitutionally moved the effective date of the Obamacare employer mandate and expended some Obamacare funds without congressional authorization.\nIn the redistricting case, Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said that the Arizona Legislature didn't have standing to challenge, in federal court, a state initiative that took the drawing of congressional district lines away from it and gave the job to an appointed commission.\nThe language Scalia used actually reads like a warning about the House of Representatives' case: \"What history and tradition show is that courts do not resolve direct disputes between two political branches of the same government regarding their respective powers.\"\nCan't imagine any member of the court's liberal bloc having a strict-constructionist epiphany on the issue. If Scalia and Thomas are going to throw it out on standing grounds, the challenge would seem well short of potential votes.\nReach Robb at robert.robb@arizonarepublic.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:57:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
