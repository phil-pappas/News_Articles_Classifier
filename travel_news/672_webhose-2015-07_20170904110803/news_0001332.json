We became keyboard-pals, a modern day version of penpals, long before we met. \nI came across Melissa and Mark's chalet in the French Alps late one night on the international home swap site, Love Home Swap (LHS), when I had all but given up hope of finding the perfect place. I had spent weeks trawling the internet for a reasonably priced, self-catering chalet in a lesser-known picturesque ski area in the Alps - one with reliable snow as far away from the glitzy Courchevels and St Moritzs as possible, but close enough to a main airport for us to drive there in an hour or so. We didn't want much, really! \nNot only did we achieve all of the above, but it was free thanks to the points I had amassed as a member of LHS. The company offers a system in which members earn credits when they have guests stay with them. Those credits can then be \"spent\" at other LHS homes anywhere in the world at any time. \nWe stayed a week at Melissa and Mark's chalet, La Tibolire, in the tiny French alpine village of Sixt Fer à Cheval, which proudly displays the banner \"L'un des Plus Beaux Villages de France\". The River Giffre flows right through the centre of the beautiful village, which consists of a cluster of chalets, shops, cafes, a visitor centre and a 13 th century church and abbey, surrounded by a ring of spectacular mountains. \n​The village of Sixt Fer à Cheval, rated one of the most beautiful villages in France. Photo: Melissa Feeney \nLa Tibolire is on a hill above the village, two minutes from the end of the longest run in the European Alps - the 14km \"Piste des Cascades\" - and five minutes from the vast ski domain of the Grand Massif with five substantial but far-from-glitzy skifields: Samoëns, Morillon, Sixt, Les Carroz and the high altitude Flaine. \nWe had our own cosy, two-bedroom self-contained apartment on the ground floor of the three-storey, Savoie-style chalet Melissa and Mark built in 2013 when they moved to France from the UK. \nAnd when I mentioned free, I actually meant it. No money changed hands apart from when we paid Melissa for the husky-sledding excursion she booked for us weeks in advance to make sure we did not miss out. Ad Feedback \nThe toughest pre-departure decisions were which day would suit to do the husky-sled excursion, what our preferred make and length of skis were (so Melissa could ask her mate Lionel to put them aside for us at a discounted rate), whether we wanted her to organise a week's ski pass and our preference for red or white wine. \nWhen we drove up the hill late one mid-winter afternoon, there they were, waiting outside to welcome us to La Tibolire with a fire glowing in one of those tall European fireboxes, a bottle of red wine breathing on the hearth and a traditional alpine raclette dinner already prepared. \nScenic, sunny Samoëns features wide, uncrowded slopes. Photo: Justine Tyerman \nThere were many advantages to having a couple of \"locals\" upstairs. Not only did they direct us to the best boulangerie, patisserie, supermarché and hiking tracks, they also acted as our ski guides. We were able to relax and just follow the leader without having to decipher piste maps en français or worry about how to get back to the access lift if we had skied too far or too low. \nMark knew where to find the most sublime runs on sunny, long, uncrowded slopes and the quirky eateries on the mountain, such as L'Igloo at Morillon, where we adopted the delightfully French habit of quaffing wine with lunch. \nMelissa's aforementioned mate Lionel - a delightful, modest Frenchman who spoke absolutely no English - entrusted me with a pair of brand new Dynastar Neva skis, which I fell in love with. I also fancied his labrador, who rested his head on my ski boot whenever I came into the shop. (Clever sales ploy.) \nThe sign to the dramatic Gorge de Tines.​ \nOn the days we didn't ski, Melissa produced a map of hikes and highlights for us to visit. At the top of her list was the nearby Cirque du Fer à Cheval, a jaw-dropping horseshoe-shaped canyon 5km in length with walls 500m to 700m high, crowned by the jagged peaks of Tenneverge (2987m), the Cheval Blanc (2831m) and Grenier de Commune (2775m). \nWe also hiked to the Cascade du Rouget, the \"Queen of the Alps\", a stunning waterfall high in the mountains that tumbles 90 metres in two tiers. The spray from the cascade turned to ice, transforming nearby spider webs into artworks of silver filigree. \nWe deviated from Melissa's map a few times and found ourselves in the Gorge de Tines, a dramatic, narrow gash in the side of a mountain accessible by a rocky pathway and a series of steep ladders. It was quite an adventure in a light blizzard and we took refuge in a warm cow-barn where the cud-chewing inhabitants appeared perfectly cosy and content. \nAn unusual blue- and brown-eyed husky stands out on the dog sled team. \nOn our last full day, we headed for the huskies at Espace Nordique du Haut-Giffre, a base for cross-country skiing, raquettes (snow-shoeing) and sledding of the dog and human-propelled variety high above the village of Samoëns. \nAfter a 20-minute drive up a winding mountain road from the valley, we found our musher Fabrice Hazan and his team of huskies and other husky-ish canines, barking mad to be under way. \nAs soon as we tucked ourselves into the double sled, our musher kicked the spiked anchor out of the snow and we slid off, quite sedately at first, along a wide pathway. After a few minutes, Fabrice whistled to the dogs and they gathered pace, happy to be running free. \nOnce out of earshot of the vociferous complaints of the other canines still tethered at the base, we were surprised at the silence. The only sounds were Fabrice's whistles and voice commands – he never once said mush - and the swishy sound of the sled on the snow. The 44 padded paws in a blur ahead of us were noiseless. \nTravelling at the speed of dog along a well-formed track between trees laden with snow was a real thrill. We wore our ski helmets to be on the safe side, but there was only one anxious moment when our team met rival teams coming in the opposite direction on a narrow part of the track. The dogs snarled and barked ferociously at each other but our musher made sure his animals gave the others a wide berth. \nThe day was clear and sunny with breathtaking panoramas of the valley below and the mountains beyond. We could have mushed on through the snow for hours, humming the old \"North to Alaska\" song, but after 60 minutes, we were back at base, where the huskies abruptly lay down in the snow for a well-earned snooze. \nA clear day provides breathtaking panoramic views on a dog sled ride. \nAs the sun set over the mountains in a blaze of pink and gold, we drove home to La Tibolire to share another fun evening with our hosts in their dining room. \nMark and my husband, Chris, discovered a common interest in curry, so they cooked tandoori chicken one night. We did a Kiwi lamb casserole another night and on our last evening together, Melissa wowed us with a garlic chicken dish and a divine Galette de Roi, a dessert made with almonds, oranges and rum. The galette is a special Epiphany dessert that traditionally has a bean hidden inside the filling – whoever gets the bean in their piece of pie is king or queen for the day and wears a golden crown. \nNext day, I wore my crown all the way to Geneva Airport, 85km away. \nA cosy apartment at La Tibolire offers the perfect place to unwind. Photo: Justine Tyerman \nSince joining LHS a few years ago, we have made friends, mingled with the locals and stayed free at magnificent properties in Greece, Switzerland, France, Australia and New Zealand. And the points system has now made it even easier to do so. \nWith the points Melissa and Mark earned from our stay, they are planning a trip to Florida. We are looking for somewhere warm, too... maybe Nice. \nJustine Tyerman flew Cathay Pacific from Auckland to Europe.
