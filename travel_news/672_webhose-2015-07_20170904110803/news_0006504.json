Unfortunately, it’s very busy at the National Park so tours often sell out. However, if you follow these tips, you’ll get the flight you want at the lowest price possible. \nThe first thing I tell travelers is to always book in advance. At least a week or two ahead of time. And by all means, avoid booking within 72 hours or on the same day as prices skyrocket if you make a short-notice booking (I’ve seen prices spikes of upwards 40%!). \nBook Online \nThe next thing you need to do is book online. This is where the deals are because tour companies reward travelers who self-serve and book direct. Don’t believe me? OK, try this: Call your travel agent and ask them for a quote. Then go online and compare prices. You’ll be shocked. \nAnother trick is to book the first flight of the day or an afternoon ride. These tend to be cheaper. However, they have their drawbacks. First, the early morning flight tends to fly direct into the sun en route to the Canyon. And the afternoon flights tend to be during the hottest time of the day. \nThere are two places from which to take a Grand Canyon helicopter tour. They are: Las Vegas and the South Rim, which is located near the town of Tusayan, AZ and is home to Grand Canyon National Park Airport. Please keep in mind that ONLY helicopter rides from Las Vegas are allowed to fly below the rim and land at the bottom. \nLas Vegas \nFrom Vegas, you can pick between air-only and landing tours. Both flights go over Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, the Colorado River and the Canyon. Air-only will turn back to Vegas while landing tours will land on the top or the bottom. My favorite is the one that lands at the bottom for a Champagne picnic (it can be upgraded to include a boat ride on the Colorado). \nSouth Rim \nThe most popular options are the 30-minute and 50-minute flights. The shorter one goes from the South Rim to the North Rim and back and includes flying through the famous Dragoon Corridor. The longer tour does that, too, plus everything up to the eastern border of the National Park. There’s also a helicopter/Jeep package I really like. \nI also want you guys to be aware that tours have basic and deluxe versions. The key difference is the helicopter used. The basic uses a smaller, no-frills aircraft while the deluxe uses the superior EcoStar 130, which boasts a 180-degree wraparound windshield, a 25-percent larger cabin and stadium-style bucket seats. \nConclusion \nI hope this article about summertime Grand Canyon helicopter tours helped you as you plan a trip to the National Park. Be aware that helicopter rides are super popular during this time and tend to sell out. Thus it’s best to book your flight in advance and online in order to get the cheapest price and the best flight. I can’t wait for you to do this and experience the Canyon at it’s best. \nThe author is a Grand Canyon expert and recommends going here for the best South Rim helicopter tours and here for ones that depart from Las Vegas: http://www.grandcanyonhelicopters.org/las-vegas/ \nThe author is a Grand Canyon expert and recommends going here for the best South Rim helicopter tours and here for ones that depart from Las Vegas: http://www.grandcanyonhelicopters.org/las-vegas/", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:27:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
