(Photo: LM Otero, AP) Tags American Airlines RW \nPHOENIX — American Airlines and US Airways next weekend will start the three-month process of combining their reservations systems, signaling the beginning of the end for the US Airways brand. \nWhen the complex changeover to American’s system is completed on Oct. 17, US Airways’ website will go away and the combined airlines’ flights and airport facilities, if not all planes, will carry a single name — American. \n“We’re going to be one airline for our customers,” Maya Liebman, American’s chief information officer said. \nThe final is now expected to be Flight 434, a red-eye scheduled to depart San Francisco around 10 p.m. on Oct. 16 before landing and landing in Philadelphia after 6 a.m. on Oct. 17. \nAmerican and Tempe-based US Airways merged in December 2013, retaining the American name and its Texas headquarters, and have been gradually combining their operations. The airlines’ frequent flier programs were merged earlier this year. \nThe reservations switch is one of the most complicated in an airline merger and has caused major traveler headaches in other mergers as systems went down and other glitches arose. When America West Airlines and US Airways merged their reservation systems in early 2007, major glitches arose that caused flight delays and snaking lines at several major airports. \nLast Slide Next Slide \nAmerican said it is taking three months to move US Airways’ flight reservations into American’s system instead of an overnight switch to minimize risk. Beginning on July 18, for example, all flights booked for travel Oct. 17 and beyond will be labeled as American flights in the reservation, even if the flight is booked on usairways.com and is a traditional US Airways route, say Phoenix to Seattle, San Francisco, Charlotte, N.C., or Boston. \nTravelers currently holding US Airways reservations for travel Oct. 17 and beyond will receive an e-mail letting them know their flight is now an American flight with a new reservation number. Everything else on the itinerary remains the same, the airlines say. \n“There’s nothing for customers to do,” Leibman said. “They don’t need to call reservations to get that new number.” \nAmerican executives insist it will be be business as usual for American and US Airways passengers over the next three months as the reservations integration is underway. Travelers will still be able to book on tickets on US Airways or American’s website or reservations centers. At the airport, check in for American and US Airways flights will remain separate so travelers will still need to check their itineraries to see whether US Airways or American is operating the flight. \nAmerican says it is ready for the most critical part of the changeover, on Oct. 17, when all reservations will be in American’s system. The airline says it has hired 600 new airport agents and 1,300 new reservations agents and is putting existing US Airways agents through extensive training on the new system. \nLeibman said American/USAirways has also proactively canceled some flights around Oct. 17 to “ensure that we had a little bit more breathing room when we’re doing the actual systems integration.” \nKerry Philipovitch, senior vice president of customer experience, said the airlines are ready for the biggest merger test to date. \n“It’s something that we’ve been working towards and planning for for the past couple of years,” she said. \nDawn Gilbertson is a travel reporter at The Arizona Republic .
