Holding up to 6000 people, Billy Bob's features 30 individual bar stations, live pro bull riding (on real bulls, not mechanical!) and a massive dance floor where free line-dancing lessons are held every Thursday \nFive essential things to consider before you go to the lone star state. \n1. The old adage that everything is bigger in Texas is true, particularly when it comes to meal sizes. Order an appetiser (entree) or share an entree (our main-size meal) and you'll still have enough to doggy bag. \n2. All the stereotypes you associate with Texas are typically accurate: cowboy hats, cowboy boots, conservative, Republican, meat lovers - with one exception, Austin. In sharp contrast to the rest of the state, this city boasts one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States, many of whom are more \"alternate\" in their habits and include a stack of vegetarians. \n3. Texans take their barbecues seriously and there's fierce rivalry between barbecue houses. There are food writers who specialise in critiquing barbecue alone, and in Austin, people will queue for up to seven hours at Franklin Barbecue for its world famous brisket. \n4. Texans rarely walk anywhere. Neither do they all drive \"pick-ups\" or utes (Austin, in fact, has a lot of Smart cars). It's rare to see someone taking a stroll, and they will insist you don't either. \n5. Texans really do say \"y'all\", and to feel like a local you should too - or at least make an attempt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:32:03.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
