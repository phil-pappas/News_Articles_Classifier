That’s down from 5.4 percent in May and 6.1 percent in June 2014.\nThe 5.3 percent figure is also the same as the national unemployment rate for last month, which itself was down from 5.5 percent in May and 6.1 percent in June 2014.\nUnemployment in the Seattle/Bellevue/Everett area in June was 3.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent in May and 4.7 percent in June 2014.\n The state gained 3,900 new jobs over the month, with 2,600 coming from the private sector and 1,300 from the public sector.\nEight sectors logged jobs growth, with professional and business services; transportation, warehousing and utilities, and retail trade adding the most jobs.\nWholesale trade, construction and financial activities lost the most jobs over the month.\nYear-over-year, the state added an estimated 114,700 jobs.\nIn a departure from recent trends, the state’s labor force fell in June, from 3.55 million in May to 3.54 million in June.\nThe number of unemployed people fell by 3,600 from May to June, from 190,900 to 187,300. But the number of employed people also fell, by 2,900, resulting in a decrease of 6,500 people in the labor force. (The labor force counts both those employed and unemployed actively seeking work.)\n“Participation in the labor force has been stabilizing and growing,” said Paul Turek, state labor economist with the ESD, who called the departure from the trend unexpected.\nIt’s unclear what caused the drop, and one month does not make a trend, he said.\nTurek said one possibility is that people who have been working part-time but want more full-time work, and those who have been unemployed for a while, have become discouraged.\nThe state jobless numbers seem to be tracking with what’s happening nationally. And looking at the national data there’s some evidence suggesting that those who’ve become discouraged in looking for a job and those who want full-time work but can only find part-time work “may have dropped out rather than continue to search for jobs,” Turek said.\nMay’s preliminary estimated gain of 7,700 jobs was revised downward to 7,200 jobs.\nJanet I.
