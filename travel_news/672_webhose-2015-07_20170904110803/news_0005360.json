From the surrealistic photocall that saw guests strike a pose amongst giant cut outs of the brands iconic products and symbols, to the poetic fresh rose arch that served as an entrance to the theatre and a playful exhibition of carefully conserved objects from its patrimony: everything stated loud and clearly that \"La vie est belle en Lancôme\", life is beautiful with Lancôme. \nCelebrating 80 years of Lancôme is also celebrating femininity the Lancôme way. This could not have been achieved without the women who today embody the brand: Julia Roberts, Penélope Cruz, Kate Winslet, Lupita Nyong'o, Lily Collins, Alma Jodorowsky and Daria Werbowy were all on stage together for the first time ever, to wish a happy anniversary to Lancôme. Isabella Rossellini, who graced the brand with her charm and beauty for so many years, was the master of ceremony. \nAmong the highlights of the party, which gathered more the 1200 guests from the beauty, fashion, film and art world, was ultimate showgirl Kylie Minogue's private concert of some of her most danced to songs, followed by French DJ Kiddy Smile who played late into the night. \nFrançoise Lehmann, together with Jean-Paul Agon (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L'Oréal, Lancôme's parent company), and Nicolas Hieronimus (President Selective Divisions of L'Oréal), greeted an impressive list of guests on the red carpet.

Caroline de Maigret, the Parisian muse of Lancôme and epitome of French Chic, and Lisa Eldridge, recently appointed creative director of Lancôme Make up, were also in attendance. \nThe party is only one of the highlights of a celebration that started last January with the release of 'Editions du Regard' a book celebrating the brand's heritage. This was followed by the launch of the first web only limited edition Lancôme products - three shades of the legendary L'Absolu Rouge, and a participative digital platform designed as a tribute to Lancôme's customers \"You are Lancôme\". Five participants who entered this creative 'selfie' contest won a ticket to the WÔW party last night. The celebration will reach its climax in December with the launch of two extremely limited editions: the re edition of Les Jumelés, a jewel lipstick case form Lancôme's patrimony, and a very special version of the new La Vie est Belle l'Extrait created with France's oldest high jeweller, Mellerio dit Mellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:23:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
