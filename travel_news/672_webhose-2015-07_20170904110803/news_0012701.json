It’s a perfectly natural and healthy reaction to brute reality. (Photo: Shutterstock) In our fast-paced lives, many of us don’t realise how seriously stress can affect our wellness. As a result, we often overlook the importance of keeping it under check. “Stress is not an overnight phenomenon; it builds over time. If you are observant, you can notice the signs that lead to a burnout. You should not ignore deep feelings of dissatisfaction, and a creeping sense of hopelessness. It could turn into physical and mental ailments,” says Dr Ajit Menon, interventional cardiologist.In order to stay calm and stress-free, here are a few tips that can help: Be realistic: You should realise that work is only a part of your life. The company will survive even without you, but you need to be able to survive in the absence of the company. So, strike a balance. Do what you like: In many cases, people work over long periods in jobs, which are misaligned with their skills, interests or values. Introspect on what gives you more satisfaction and pursue that vocation. Work in moderation: Working for long hours, six days a week, can make you feel spent. Take a break, travel, do yoga, and perform breathing exercises to change the way you feel. Make sure you make time every day for an activity you love. Limit stuff on your plate: Many professionals over-commit, either because they are too ambitious or because they cannot say no to their supervisors. Be realistic and develop the courage to say no. Develop better thinking skills: Being driven by perfection and pessimism can push you to the brink. Strive for excellence, not perfection. Bring exercise to the workplace: Include physical activity in your working schedule. Take the stairs if possible, exercise or go for a walk during your lunch breaks. Breathe: Relaxation does not only mean going on a vacation. The best way to relax is to focus on your breathing. At work, try to close your eyes, and breathe deeply every four to five hours for two minutes. Physical exercise: To de-stress your eyes, close them and pinch your eyebrows, starting from the centre of the forehead and moving towards the end of the eyebrows. You can also massage your forehead. Long working hours also impose stress on your shoulder muscles. Every two-three hours, take a deep breath, shrug your shoulders up to your ear and drop them down. Also, do some neck exercises by looking up and down, and sideways every two hours. Me time: Take days off from work, and go on a short vacation. And while you are away, keep interruptions such as phones or laptops at bay. Also try limiting your indulgence in alcohol and smoking. What causes stress? When your resistanceresources are overworked, your exhausted body stops functioning smoothly. The signs may show up physically, psychologically, or behaviourally. Not only can anxiety, depression, irritability, fear, guilt and boredom cause stress, but they can also be psychological signs of it.
