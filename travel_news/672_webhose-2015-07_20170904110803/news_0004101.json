Photograph by: Handout photo , Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa \nThe Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa Palm Beach is bringing contemporary boutique chic to one of the most desirable locations along the Florida Gold Coast . \nThis crystalline jewel is one of a handful of oceanfront hotels in the posh island resort community of Palm Beach. It’s adjacent to the Four Seasons and about nine kilometres south of Worth Avenue, so you know you’re in an excellent neighbourhood. \nOpen about six months, Tideline packs a lot of resort punch for a compact property. It’s a contemporary, low-rise glass structure of 134 rooms and suites on five storeys, with see-through glass balconies yielding views of the Atlantic. Fountains – at the entrance, at the pool and in the lobby – add the soothing sound of gurgling water and a fresh feeling. \nWith a pool, beach club and restaurant, it’s popular for weddings because of the glassfronted Ocean Ballroom and the photo-worthy outdoor terrace for ceremonies, parties and bachelorette parties. \nTideline also is relatively good value for a deluxe beachfront hotel in Palm Beach. It does not charge a resort fee and it lays out free morning coffee and afternoon wine, followed by Happy Hour. The concierge has bicycles, and a handy stash of If-You-Forgot-It items such as cellphone chargers and hair irons. And children get a welcome gift of toys they can take home. Summer specials (until Oct. 31) include 20 to 30 per cent off on multiple-night stays, upgrades with continental breakfast for $5 and $99 spa treatments, The decor is a modern take on a tropical South Asian look. Exotic dark wood and colours of dark coconut and vanilla create cool, shady interiors, with pops of lime, saffron and lavender. \nWhat is so appealing is that everything is at hand. Walk out the front door and you are at the infinity pool. It is a Zenstyle beauty, with a wall of falling water and a hot tub, all surrounded by palms, Ming plants and bamboo trees. \nWalk out the Tideline’s back door and you’re at the beach where aqua umbrellas flutter in the ocean breeze. I watched a pickup game of beach volleyball as well as an exciting show of adventurous kite-surfers conquering the waves and wind. \nFOOD AND DRINK \nTideline is a new name – and a hotel with news. Kimpton recently acquired the Omphoy Resort and renamed it Tideline Ocean Resort & Spa Palm Beach. There are changes afoot, including some renovations, upgraded cuisine and the expansion of the sushi bar. \nExecutive chef Chris Schaeffer recently arrived at Tideline’s Brandon’s by the Beach from the attractive Seagate Beach Club in Delray Beach, so we know the food is delish. The menu has global influences, but Schaeffer is adding more seafood and a modern American style. \nSome of his specialties for dinner are charred octopus, steaks, snapper and cobia, chanterelle risotto and barbecue chicken confit. \nHappy Hour features zingy $6 cocktails such as the vodka smash and bourbon drinks, and bar snacks including calamari and roasted Parmesan-garlic fries. \nAll good, but there is nothing that can beat the indulgence of lunch served at your sun-dappled chaise longue. \nSPA AND WELLNESS \nThe Tideline Oasis Massage – you can schedule for singles or couples – uses plant extracts for the ultimate in muscle relaxation. There are facials customized for teens and men, plus mini-salons for nails, hair styling and waxing. \nTideline’s Well, Well, Well program features yoga led by a hotel manager. If you prefer to exercise solo, the hotel supplies a yoga mat in each guest room, bicycles, plus maps of the best jogging routes and a fitness centre. Motion Water Sports rents equipment for ocean sports such as paddle-boarding, kitesurfing, kayaking, plus boogie boards, jet skis, surfboards and catamaran sailing. Lessons are available. \nIF YOU GO \nTideline Ocean Resort & Spa: 855-523-5455, 561-540-6440, tidelineresort.com ; 2842 S. Ocean Blvd., Palm Beach, Fla.
