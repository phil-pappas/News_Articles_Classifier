Terms of the deal were not released, but the airline said they include wage increases, bonus opportunities, and work-rule adjustments.\n“I applaud the efforts of everyone who worked so hard to craft an agreement that rewards our Flight Attendants for their excellence,” said Mike Van de Ven, Southwest Airlines Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. “This tentative agreement not only provides additional money, it also supports Southwest’s low-cost structure and positions the Company to be competitive in the years to come.”\nSouthwest Airlines Vice President of Cabin Services Mike Hafner said, “We have the finest Flight Attendants in the industry. Each day and on every flight, our Flight Attendants bring Southwest’s Purpose to life for our Customers—connecting them to what’s important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel.”\nSouthwest Airlines Flight Attendants, represented by Transport Workers Union (TWU) 556, will be presented with the details of the agreement in the coming weeks, and members will have the opportunity to vote on ratification. The current contract became amendable May 31, 2013. If approved, the new agreement will run through May 2019.\nSource:- Southwest Airlines\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Lufthansa Group increases result in core business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:06:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
