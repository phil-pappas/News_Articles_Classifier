It’s the first of its kind in the UK – the technology comes from France – and its location, at the Lake District Visitor Centre at Brockhole , means there’s plenty to do when you return to Earth: boat trips, pony rides, vast adventure playground, or splashing around on the edge of Windermere.\nRelated: Take the kids to … Shrek’s Adventure, London\nFun fact\nThe nets, hand-sewn by French ex-fishermen, were designed to help researchers gain access to the highest reaches of the Amazon rainforest.\nBest thing(s) about it\nThe freedom to leap around in the treetops, no harness required. The adjacent Treetop Trek high-ropes course takes you, Go Ape! -style, over a series of rope bridges, daredevil leaps and zip wires (harness essential).\nWhat about lunch?\nFight for a picnic table or laze beside the water. Paninis in the Terrace Café (£4.95) come from the nearby More? artisan bakery .\nExit through the gift shop?\nIt sells quirky pocket-money treats, but it’s hidden away in the main house.\nRelated: Take the kids to ... Powderham Castle, Kenton, south Devon\nGetting there\nArrive by boat from Ambleside ( windermere-lakecruises.co.uk ) or bus (routes 555 and 599). It’s off the A591, halfway between Windermere and Ambleside. Parking from £2 an hour.\nValue for money?\nNot bad for unaccompanied children (from seven years), but adults must go on with three- to six-year-olds (one per two children), so the bill soon adds up: two-hour slots cost £16 adults, £16 children (5+), £11 accompanying adults, and £11 under-5s. You can spend the rest of the day at Brockhole, though, where the playground, walking and orienteering trails are almost free (trail leaflets cost 50p-£2).\nOpening times\nYear round. Booking recommended ( treetopnets.co.uk , 01539 447186).\nVerdict\n7/10.", "external_links": ["http://www.moreartisan.co.uk/", "https://www.windermere-lakecruises.co.uk/", "http://www.treetoptrek.co.uk/", "http://goape.co.uk/", "http://www.treetopnets.co.uk/", "http://www.brockhole.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-14T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:27:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
