The \"Mushroom Savanna\" was born (see the pic in the above gallery).\nHe soon returned to the advertising industry, which began commissioning him for campaigns for various food based products and brands.\nWhen planning a shoot, Warner says he decides which ingredients will be used for a scene, then a food stylist and model maker help build it.\nThe whole process can take several days and the scenes are sometimes shot in layers in order to work quickly with fresh produce, he says.\nWarner's Foodscapes are often displays in exhibitions, as he continues to work in advertising.\nHe tells CNN he's now in pre-production for a campaign for a U.S. restaurant chain. Meanwhile, his work is also set to expand its global reach.\n\"My children's book is being translated into Japanese with a book launch and exhibition there next spring.\"\nTo see a selection of Warner's work, check out the above gallery.\nTo view more of his amazing Foodscapes or buy prints of his work check out his website, www.carlwarner.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.carlwarner.com/books/wall-calendar-1-7", "http://www.carlwarner.com/foodscapes/"], "published": "2015-07-15T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T09:09:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
