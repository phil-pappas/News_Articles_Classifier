As guests become more environmentally conscious, hotels will need to adapt and adjust to fit their wants and needs. \n“This is the next level in what the hotel started several years ago when it first adopted beehives and live plants on the roof,” said David Rothwell, general manager at The Ritz-Carlton , Charlotte. “By taking our rooftop offering and expanding it to the lobby, we further enrich the guest experience when it comes to our LEED Gold story and environmental expectations. \n“Since The Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte first opened in late 2009, our focus has been on mindful environmental travel and sustainable living,” he said. “This has become increasingly important, as we see our millennial guests frequently asking about sustainable practices, recycling and local food offerings. \n“Charlotte itself is a young, vibrant community, so the fit is ideal.” \nEco-friendly Ritz-Carlton Charlotte’s roof is home to 10,000 plants and two productive beehives containing 100,000 insects. Leveraging the garden’s output, the hotel staff hand delivers ingredients grown atop the building to the chefs, mixologists and spa therapists so they can be used when they are freshest. \nThis garden has inspired a new menu of treatments in the penthouse Spa & Wellness Center, including a Garden Glow Body Scrub. The mixologists in the Punch Room also took inspiration from the garden for new cocktails, including a St. Charles Punch that combines brandy, port and lemon juice with mint and jalapeño harvested on-site. \nBeekeeper at work at Ritz-Carlton Charlotte \nBeyond providing ingredients such as honey to the hotel’s restaurants and bars and spa, this garden insulates the building, reduces runoff and helps to mitigate the urban heat island effect. \nThis focus on locally grown food continues in the hotel’s lobby, where guests can peruse a farmers market, snipping their own herbs, learning of related recipes and leaving with complimentary produce. Also on the first floor, as consumers enter they will walk past a garden on the perimeter growing plants such as tomatoes, lavender, mint, basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano and lantana. \nFor agrarian experiences outside the hotel, guests can acquire a bicycle from the hotel’s bike valet and pedal to tours of markets and gardens in the area. \nAlso bringing a local flavor to the initiatives, guests can join Charlotte area residents in a cooking class in the hotel’s Cocoa Lab kitchen, where they will learn how to prepare delicacies that incorporate rooftop ingredients. \nRitz-Carlton Charlotte agritourism \nAllowing guests to get involved, the hotel encourages them to make sandwiches for locals in need as part of its Operation Sandwich. Consumers can also participate in Earth Day celebrations, helping staff plant on nearby rooftops and paths. \nTeaching the next generation about conservation, the hotel gifts each child who stays with a potted plant that they can take home and care for. Staff also offer rooftop tours to local elementary schools. \nHotel neighbors visit the front drive Community Garden to snip herbs for their own home cooking \n“Our leisure guests have very enthusiastically embraced the agritourism concept, taking home herbs to enjoy and much more,” Mr. Rothwell said. \n“Our local neighbors are enthusiastic as well,” he said. “We have been giving rooftop tours to area school groups and scout troops – as well as groups of overnight guests.” \nSustainable practices Previously, Ritz-Carlton, Charlotte strengthened its commitment to environmentally-friendly practices and operations by permanently installing a multi-power station for affluent guests who drive electric vehicles. \nThe charging station is complimentary to hotel guests and features two charging ports for simultaneous usage. While electric vehicle charging stations are an increasingly frequent sight across the country, such a prominent presence at The Ritz-Carlton was noteworthy for the hospitality industry ( see story ). \nAs consumers become more aware of the negative impact of their travels, they are increasingly favoring environmentally and socially responsible alternatives, according to a new report by Booking.com. \nThe impacts of travel are myriad, direct and indirect, and compound over time. As consumers see first-hand or learn about the cumulative effect of easy travel, they are turning their qualms into action ( see story ). \n“Agritourism is an offshoot of culinary tourism, one of the major travel trends that continues to accelerate and evolve on a global level,” said Karen Weiner Escalera, president of KWE Partners , a Miami-based luxury travel PR and marketing firm. \n“For a luxury hotel or resort to get onboard has multiple benefits,” she said. “First, it highlights the fact that the property has a commitment to farm to table products in its food and beverage offerings, and what better way than to grow the products in house? \n“Having a farmers market which supports small, local purveyors, is a solid community relations gesture, and the bike tours of local gardens and markets is an educational activity which hits on still another trend, a desire for learning and enrichment on holiday.” \nFinal Take Sarah Jones, staff reporter on Luxury Daily, New York Sarah Jones is staff reporter on Luxury Daily, New York.
