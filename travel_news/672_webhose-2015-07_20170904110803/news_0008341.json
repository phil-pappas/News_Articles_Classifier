For me, New York has only ever meant one thing: movies. Virtually all my favourite films have that familiar skyscrapered backdrop. So, a few years ago, the chance to spend a whole week there was a dream come true. I avoided the movie-location tours on offer, preferring my own itinerary. I visited Tiffany’s just like Audrey Hepburn as Holly Golightly, above; I picnicked on the bench by the Brooklyn Bridge where Woody Allen and Diane Keaton sat in Manhattan; I strolled the Brooklyn dockyards strutted by Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront; and I rode the lift up the Empire State Building – what other movie setting has hosted Tom Hanks, Gene Kelly and a 50ft gorilla? As Kelly rightfully sang: “New York, New York, it’s a wonderful town!” Steve Green wins a £250 Railbookers voucher Further feedback from readers Who says Cubans are down-at-heel? I have a different view of Havana to Mike Spragg’s ( Your Travels , July 18). Yes, it is run down, but the underlying beauty is still there. As are the warmth, generosity and friendliness of its people . I found it a fascinating, quirky city – and the dogs were cared for by all. I loved it, including crazy cars and chickens wandering in and out. It will stay long in my memory as one of my favourite places. There was a lot of building and renovations going on. Cuba will join the 21st century and I’m glad for its people. I just hope it doesn’t lose its soul. Christine Cook I am surprised that Mike Spragg booked his cruise in the first place. I went there four years ago specifically to see it before it was changed into a homogenised American-style port. It was everything I was expecting. Yes, there is poverty and empty shops, but the people were friendly and lively and there were bands and music in the streets and cafés. More food and supplies are needed, as is assistance with rebuilding, but the people are very resourceful, as could be seen by the items for sale in the markets. Patricia Jarvis Cricket ground joys Further to your selection of beautiful cricket grounds in England , I would like to nominate Emirates Old Trafford. This historic ground has given the game some of its finer moments, including Jim Laker’s 19-wicket haul in 1956, Shane Warne’s ball of the century and Sachin Tendulkar’s maiden Test ton. Since its multimillion-pound redevelopment, it has managed to aesthetically combine its proud heritage with the accoutrements of a thriving modern ground. Paul Holliday My childhood idyll I was interested in your feature on family days out (July 18) and in particular the item on Sutton Park, Birmingham. As a child in the Fifties, I spent most of my leisure time cycling to and from Sutton Park. In the winter Wyndley, where people fed the ducks, presented a different face. Donning ancient skating boots, I tried to stay upright on its frozen surface. Bracebridge with its tea room was approached by a series of bridges. Blackroot was the venue for the Christmas Day dip, giving entertainment to the crowds who gathered to watch. For a keen swimmer, Keepers lido was a great attraction where you could swim out to a raft in the middle of its murky waters. But the best place for me was Powell’s Pool where as a Sea Ranger I learnt to sail, in a small single-handed dinghy with instructions shouted from the shore. Other memories include Acker Bilk playing at an open-air concert and the World Scout Jamboree in 1957. There were no donkeys, though. Mrs L Jean Cook Lounge in luxury I enjoyed Nick Trend’s recommendations on how to enjoy peak-time holidays ( Travel News , July 18) but he missed out airport lounges. This is where our holidays start. These areas are quiet and relaxing when all around is chaos. You can read magazines you wouldn’t normally see, along with the day’s newspapers. Chairs are comfy, there is unlimited hot and cold drinks, including Dutch courage for the flight. Snacks are also part of the deal, plus the latest flight news. It is an oasis of calm before you take-off. Birmingham and Manchester are particularly good. As an added bonus, Daily Telegraph subscribers get a considerable reduction. Bon voyage!
