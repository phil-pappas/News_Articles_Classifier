Let me assure you, those worries are completely unfounded and you might want to move there, if you want a better quality of life during your retirement , that is. \nIn reading the comments about an article I recently wrote about why North Americans are moving to Panama, Belize, or Nicaragua, I realized that people had the completely wrong impression about what it's like to live there, starting with commonly held beliefs that are just plain wrong. \nSo, here are four myths about living in Central America -- debunked. \nMy views here come from conducting interviews with over a thousand expats, the results of a study, Expats: Expectations & Reality , and from the more than 5,000 answers to questions about living overseas provided by more than 400 expats on my Web site, Best Places In The World To Retire . \nMust Read: 21 Best Places to Retire Overseas \n1. \"The health care is terrible.\" \nThe U.S. still sets the worldwide standard for high-end health care, and specifically in certain specialties. However, for the vast majority of people who don't need high-end health care in these specialized areas on an ongoing basis, there are many places in Central America where you can find extremely good health care, at a small fraction of the cost as in the U.S. Just two examples: Hospital Punta Pacifica, in Panama City, is affiliated with Johns Hopkins, which calls Punta Pacifica a \" state of the art facility .\" Locals agree, adding that there are at least two other hospitals in Panama City that are at least up to big city U.S. health care standards. Hospital Metropolitano Vivian Pellas, in Managua, Nicaragua has gotten rave reviews. Seizing a business opportunity, the hospital has developed a department to facilitate medical tourism, targeting patients from North America who want very high-end medical care at costs so low that they can work an extended vacation into the deal and still pay less overall. \nBoth hospitals have Joint Commission International accreditation , which is the oldest and largest health care standards setting and accrediting body in the United States. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:08:11.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
