The largest of Beijing’s eight districts in terms of both land area and number of residents, the eastern Chaoyang District was home to 3.84 million people by the end of 2013, according to the latest statistics. Then how good is BJCYQZ at collecting intelligence? Who are they? What has turned them from common people into capable intelligence workers? How good is BJCYQZ at collecting intelligence? “A Chaoyang resident came to our drug control team this January, reporting the unusual behavior of one of his neighbours. The neighbour was reportedly behaving much like a drug user, as he was sneaking around, staying at home in the daytime and going out at night or sometimes staying up all night,” said Li Jiangbo, the deputy director of the drug control team of the district police station. “We followed the tip and discovered more than 30 grams of ice (methamphetamine) at the neighbour’s house and also two of his suppliers,” added Li. In April, 12 foreign drug users were detained and a foreign drug-dealing network was busted based on the intelligence provided by a resident in Chaoyang A policeman installs alarm equipment at a primary school in Chaoyang District Ahead of the UN’s International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking this year in June, the police located two suspects and then confiscated 1kg of ice after receiving anonymous tip-offs from a Chaoyang resident claiming that someone was using a specific express delivery firm to deliver a massive amount of drugs. What’s more, a number of high-profile Chinese celebrities were found using drugs by the police, all based on tips provided by residents in Chaoyang, according to the official notices issued by the police. Besides drug control, residents in Chaoyang have also tipped the police about celebrities buying sex, resulting in the arrest of famous micro-blogger Charles Xue (whose nickname is Xuemanzi) and well-known Chinese actor Huang Haibo. Clues provided by residents in Chaoyao have also proved valuable in helping police crack cases about illegal constructions, fire hazards and unlicensed taxis. Who are they? “I believe BJCYQZ refers to ordinary people who believe in justice, abide by the law and have the courage to fight against crime,” said Li. Sun Zongfen, 73, and people like her conduct regular patrols of their community, which features newcomers because it’s close to a hospital and a flea market frequented by foreigners. Community patrols talk with each other on a street in Beijing “I came across a stranger entering our unit carrying something unusual, who failed to tell me which floor he lived on, so I followed him upstairs and found out that he was a new tenant,” said Sun, “If he shows more suspicious behaviour, I will report it to the police.” “We have a hotline to the director of our local police station, the officers of which will arrive within 10 minutes after they receive our call,” said Yu Xiaohui, a community patrol volunteer who has lived in her community for 32 years. “We know everyone in our apartment building.” No crimes have taken place in Yu’s community in 12 years, even though it has only two police officers. Apart from the permanent residents in communities, BJCYQZ also includes security staff at companies and entities, college students and various volunteers who are able to cover the corners that are beyond the reach of community police officers, according to Han Chunxi, deputy director of the population management division of the district police station. BJCYQZ is not a newly emerging security force consisting of common people – it now involves about 120,000 people, said Han. Besides Chaoyang District, common people across all other districts of Beijing all also play a very important role in keeping the capital safe and stable. Statistics show that Beijing police received more than 1,500 drug-related tips from common people, up 64.8 per cent year-on-year, and 240 of them provided valuable information, which led to the arrest of more than 260 suspects since the beginning of this year. Square dancers perform on World No Tobacco Day in Beijing From March 2014, when Beijing police started rewarding people who provided valuable tips about terror-related crimes, to May 2015, common people provided more than 800 tips, helping the police crack cases involving the illegal ownership and transport of guns and explosives, as well as cases of instigating violent terrorist activities. While some internet users complain about the nosy seniors in their communities, others believe that residents reporting their neighbours’ suspicious behaviours to the police doesn’t mean the community is closed to outsiders, but provides both residents and visitors a more reassuring place to live. • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
