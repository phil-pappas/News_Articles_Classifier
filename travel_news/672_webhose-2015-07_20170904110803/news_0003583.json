Today, she left court with her face covered by a scarf.\n“At no stage have I suggested or even thought that the use of drugs while driving is OK.\n“There should be no suggestion otherwise that I was suggesting I was ‘OK’ with it.”\nREAD JUDGE BEAZLEY’S FULL REMARKS\nLenarczyk, 39, was charged with one aggravated count of causing serious harm by dangerous driving.\nAt trial, prosecutors alleged she had just picked up her own three children from school when she ran a red light and hit Nickolas Falco, 12, at a Salisbury Heights pedestrian crossing.\nIt was the fifth time Lenarczyk had driven while unregistered, uninsured and without a licence, and she had completed a good behaviour bond for prior offending just four months earlier.\nNickolas sustained a broken leg, collapsed lung, abdominal injuries and skull fractures.\nIn his verdict, Judge Beazley acquitted Lenarczyk of the major offence and instead found her guilty of the lesser charge of driving without due care.\nHe ruled prosecutors had not proved, beyond reasonable doubt, the “mid-level” recording of methylamphetamine in her system caused any adverse effect on her driving.\nHe said that, based on medical evidence, it may have had “a positive effect” instead.\nJudge Beazley’s ruling angered Nickolas’ mother, Jaki Watson, who said her son was “haunted” and the verdict should be challenged on appeal .\nIt also prompted SA Police to hold a media conference, where a senior officer spoke about the dangers of using drugs while driving, and generated widespread community debate.\nJaki Watson and Nickolas Falco.

Source: News Corp Australia\nToday, Nickolas’ victim impact statement was read to the court.\nIn it, Nickolas wrote he had once been a happy BMX rider who was confident to attempt tricks, but was now a frightened, bullied, anxious young man.\n“I felt paranoid and curious about who this person (Lenarczyk) was, why she did this to me, and why me,” he wrote.\n“I started to become more angry, moody and stressed ... I have angry outbursts ... I once smashed my expensive laptop with my crutches ... I still get very angry at the smallest things.”\nHis words reduced Lenarczyk, who sat in the dock of the court, to tears and she continued to cry as Ms Watson read her victim impact statement aloud.\nMs Watson said Nickolas now suffered from post-traumatic stress, struggled to come to terms with his multiple scars and had broken a bone in his hand by punching a wall in anger.\n“I’m very disappointed with the verdict and believe it sends a message to the community that you can drive while on drugs,” she said.\nShe then addressed Lenarczyk personally, asking her “what right” she had to be on the road while drugged “in the first place”.\n“As a mother I don’t understand why you would put your own children at risk ... what gives you the right to do what you like with drugs in your system?” she said.\n“You had eight seconds to respond to those lights, why didn’t you stop?\n“Your selfish actions almost cost my son his life and, in many ways, you have taken part of him ... I don’t forgive you for what you have done.\n“A good behaviour bond is not enough — you should go to prison.”\nThe court also heard a community impact statement from Michael O’Connell, the Commissioner for Victims’ Rights.\nHe said there was “no safe level” of methylamphetamine in a person’s system and that road laws should be amended to “zero tolerance, zero level” of the drug, even if prescribed.\nDistrict Court Judge Barry Beazley. Source: News Limited\nJudge Beazley thanked Mr O’Connell for his comments, calling them “common sense” and “entirely appropriate”.\n“What I did do in my reasons was base my decision not upon my view of methylamphetamine but my perception of shortcomings in the evidence,” he said.\n“I relied upon two leading experts in Australia as to what the effect would be ... that was the basis of my decision.”\nAdam Richards, for Lenarczyk, said his client was on the road that day because she “needed” to take her children to school, and they lived too far away to walk.\nHe said she was in the midst of moving house at the time, and a friend who was helping her had given her methylamphetamine.\n“It had only been for the purpose of trying to keep her energy levels up so she could continue working (on the move),” he said.\nMr Richards said Lenarczyk had been “devastated” by the incident and her children were “distraught” because they had witnessed both it and their mother’s arrest.\nAs he spoke, Ms Watson stood up and left the court.\nLeah Jane Lenarczyk outside the District Court before a previous hearing. Source: News Corp Australia\nMr Richards read an apology on Lenarczyk’s behalf, in which she wrote she “could not emphasise enough” her sorrow, regret, remorse or contrition.\n“I worry, knowing what pain I have caused (Nickolas) ... I struggle with the anguish and frustration that his family must feel,” she wrote.\n“I’m not a bad person ... (this was) an error in judgment, one mistake, one instance in time I wish could be reversed.\n“That shouldn’t be enough to destroy more lives and tear apart a loving family.”\nMr Richards urged the court to suspend any jail term imposed upon his client.\n“It’s a terrible reality for everyone of us who uses the roads that accidents happen — that’s what this is, an accident,” he said.\n“An accident is an accident, it’s a terrible thing for Nickolas, but it was an accident and nothing more.”\nCharles Wright, prosecuting, said Lenarczyk’s conduct went much further than a mere accident when viewed in the context of her offending history.\n“It’s abundantly clear she needs a strong deterrent in the form of an immediate custodial sentence,” he said.\n“She has been given fines, licence disqualifications and bonds, yet she continues to flout and show blatant disregard for the law and flagrant disregard for court orders.\n“Her prospects for rehabilitation are bleak.”\nJudge Beazley remanded Lenarczyk on continuing bail for sentencing in two weeks.\nShe left court, accompanied by supporters, with her face covered by a scarf.\nFollow @SeanFewster", "external_links": ["http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/Judgments/Lists/Judgments/Attachments/2077/2015%20SADC%2095.pdf", "https://twitter.com/SeanFewster", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227443/878298-e47d2804-2ac4-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/073912-e0063752-2ac4-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/072793-f52785fa-2ac4-11e5-a918-69a980c5d30d.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/072849-ea398664-2b5c-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-16T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:09:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
