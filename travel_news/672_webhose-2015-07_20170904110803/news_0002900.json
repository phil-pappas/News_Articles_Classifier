It’s all possible with LifeProof’s FRE Power case. Able to be submersed for 2 meters for one hour, survive dirt and dust (and sand), block snow and ice, and survive drops from 2 meters — it may not be Superman, but it’s a super case. When you forget to charge it, no need to plug into the wall or an external battery. Just flip the switch and get a jolt of energy to extend the journey. An optical-glass lens and Sound Enhancement System ensures your photos are nothing less than stellar and you never have to endure sub-optimal beats. To top it off, the case isn’t much larger than the LifeProof case without the battery charger. \nWhat we liked: Full phone protection and a battery case in one? That’s the dream for daily adventurers, weekend warriors and travelers who want it all. \nNot so much: Those who prefer that nothing come between their finger and their glass phone screen may not love the built-in scratch protector. \nVitals: LifeProof FRE Power case, $129.99 from www.lifeproof.com. \n— Jill K.
