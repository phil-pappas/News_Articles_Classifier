Adrian Mariappa (Palace), Rudy Austin (Leeds), Joel Grant (Yeovil), Jobi McAnuff (Orient) and Simon Dawkins (Derby) among the UK-based players getting no sleep this summer. Others: El Salvador v Canada (03.30), CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 548/ 550 HD, 03.00 France U19 v Ukraine U19 (19.45) Uefa Under-19 Championship Group Stage, British Eurosport 2 VM 525/526 HD, 19.30 Friday July 10 Mexico v Cuba (02.30), CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 548/ 550 HD, 02.00 Mexico, like Jamaica, hot-footing it straight from the Copa America to this one. Perennial favourites for the competition, and winners six times out of 12, they'll certainly be well-supported. Watch out for the anti-Donald Trump banners. Others: Trinidad & Tobago v Guatemala (00.00), CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 548/ 550 HD, 00.00 Spain U19 v Russia U19 (17.00) Uefa Under-19 Championship Group Stage, British Eurosport VM 523/524 HD, 16.30 Germany U19 v Holland U19 (19.00) Uefa Under-19 Championship Group Stage, British Eurosport VM 523/524 HD, 19.00 Honduras v Panama (23.00), CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 548/ 550 HD, 23.00 Saturday July 11 USA v Haiti (01.30), CONCACAF Gold Cup 2015 Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 548/ 550 HD, 01.30 A David v Goliath clash in every sense of the over-used cliché. Here's a lazy population stat that poor sports journalists often trot out at such times – 319 million v 10 million. Still only 11 v 11 though isn't it? Anybody can beat anybody on their day. Urgh, I'm boring myself now. Sunday July 12 New York City FC v Toronto FC (22.15), American MLS, Sky Sports 1 VM 502/512 HD, 22.00 A potential first airing of the Frank Lampard-Andrea Pirlo partnership in the New York midfield? The Italian is currently showing up middle-aged men everywhere by looking good in beachwear while his exit from Juventus is negotiated. Will they be any match for the prolific Toronto strike pairing of Jozy Altidore and Luke Moore (seven goals between them this year)? LA Galaxy v Club America (04.30) International Champions Cup, Sky Sports 1 VM 502/512 HD, 04.30 No, me neither.
