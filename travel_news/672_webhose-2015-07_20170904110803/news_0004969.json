Donald said that to meet that goal, the company is cutting costs and reinvesting in the business. \"Fuel is our single largest expense,\" Donald said. \"We've reduced over a billion gallons of fuel usage since 2007. So we continue about being very smart about consumption, and then LNG (liquified natural gas) in the future, environmentally it is even better.\"Donald said switching to LNG will also lead to future cost reductions. Carnival recently signed a multi-billion dollar contract to build four new cruises ships that will be powered by liquefied natural gas , becoming the first in the industry to do so. The first LNG ship, which will have a total capacity of 6,600 guests, will be operating in 2019. In terms of cruise pricing, Donald said \"we expect prices to go up. I would encourage people to book sooner rather than later because prices are going to go up.\"In its latest quarter , Carnival reported strong booking volumes. Carnival is also about to set sail into uncharted waters, by offering future cruises to Cuba. \"There's so much pent-up demand in the U.S.,\" said Donald. \"Over time, Cuba is going to be a tremendous asset, not only to us, but to the industry overall.\"Donald also discussed Carnival's plans to increase capacity in China, and its new social impact cruise line, Fathom . \"It's actually a fantastic way for a traveler to get an immersion experience and a cultural exchange, and to have a wonderful impact working alongside others, in this case, in the Dominican Republic,\" said Donald. The first Fathom cruise is scheduled for next April. Carnival hopes the Fathom line will begin trips to Cuba in May 2016. Donald also said that Europe remains a tougher travel market overall, but that the company is still growing there. Donald spoke with TheStreet's Rhonda Schaffler at the New York Stock Exchange , where company officials rang the closing bell in celebration of the 175th anniversary of its Cunard cruise line .
