Travel agents and corporate customers using Amadeus will have direct access to this information with total accuracy in the availability of their flights and seats, increasing the global awareness of the Interjet brand in markets where it has previously had minor presence. Interjet will also adopt Amadeus Altéa Reservation, a new generation IT platform for booking and electronic ticketing which will allow the airline to meet the needs of the travel agency booking flow, enjoy greater efficiency in operations, and connect to other airlines – ultimately delivering a strong service experience for the traveller. The adoption of Amadeus Altéa Reservation will enable Interjet to leverage the opportunities arising from its strong expansion, and in particular its partnerships established with other world-class airlines. \"We are delighted to confirm this agreement. We are convinced that Amadeus technology will allow us to increase our operative efficiency and make our services available for more users around the world, at the same time we consolidate our growth in both, national and international, markets. ,” said José Luis Garza, General Director of Interjet. \"Interjet is a visionary company that seeks to innovate as part of its growth strategy, supporting its transformation into one of the leading carriers of the Americas. Our technology will enable travel agents worldwide to book Interjet flights in a simple and uniform way,” said John Dąbkowski, Vice President, Airline Commercial at Amadeus. \"Through this partnership we are able to offer more options to our platform users, and at the same time bring Interjet content to new customer audiences in international markets,” Dabkowski concluded. Airlines with which Amadeus has a content agreement represent over 80% of the airline bookings made through the Amadeus system worldwide. Already over 80 low-cost carriers have become Amadeus distribution partners, and low-cost carrier bookings through travel agencies using Amadeus increased 19% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2015.
