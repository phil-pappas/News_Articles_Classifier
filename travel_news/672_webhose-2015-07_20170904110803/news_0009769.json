A precursor to Seafair, it took place from July 15 to July 20 that year, the second year of the festival. (Seattle Times Archive) The 5 day celebration of Seattle was a predecessor to Seafair. Seattle Times staff \nBefore the annual Seafair Festival, there was the Golden Potlatch. \nThe festival featured airplanes doing stunts along waterfront, “hydroaeroplane” flights on the water, a parade downtown, performances by groups from around the Northwest and fireworks displays throughout the city. \nAccording to the July 16, 1912, article in The Seattle Daily Times, the festival kicked off with the Alaska pageant, where the “Tilikums of Elttaes” paraded while telling a story of Alaska and the importance of the gold rush to Seattle. \nThe Tilikums, city boosters who sometimes wore “native” costumes, produced and performed in the parade. \nAfter the festival, the Times received this praise of the Potlatch. \n“This year’s Potlatch has been one of the greatest successes that the public spirit of Seattle has ever undertaken. It has brought about more good fellowship and amity than years of ordinary endeavor would do, and the money spent, while not directly felt in certain places, will work its way into all trade channels to the mutual benefit of all.” ­­– John J. Gorman, manager of Grote-Rankin Company. \nPostcards from the Past is an occasional feature, highlighting the history of the Pacific Northwest. The images are from The Seattle Times archive.
