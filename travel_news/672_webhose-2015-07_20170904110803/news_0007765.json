It seems like every week in America there's a shooting.\n— Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) July 24, 2015 I just want people to be safe, especially people that are doing one of my favorite things in the WORLD - going out to the movies 2 have fun.\n— Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) July 24, 2015 The overhaul of gun laws Wilson referred to in her tweets was Australia’s National Firearms Program Implementation Act.\nThe law strictly regulated private ownership of guns following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 when 35 people were murdered by Martin Bryant in Tasmania.\nWilson isn’t the first person to use Australia’s strict gun laws as a comparison, President Obama also made reference to them earlier this year.\nWhile speaking on comedian Marc Maron’s WTF podcast, President Obama said America had to reassess its approach to gun laws.\n“The truth of the matter is that this doesn’t happen with this kind of frequency in other countries,” he said.\n“When Australia had a mass killing, I think in Tasmania about 25 years ago it was just so shocking to the system that the whole country said, ‘we’re going to completely change our gun laws’. And they did, and it hasn’t happened since.”\nOriginally published as Rebel Wilson slams US gun laws", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RebelWilson/status/624638018259939329", "http://www.news.com.au/world/louisiana-cinema-shooting-gunman-opens-fire-on-audience-during-trainwreck-screening/story-fndir2ev-1227455231395", "http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama", "https://twitter.com/RebelWilson/status/624638334552436736", "https://twitter.com/RebelWilson/status/624636086741004288", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/rebel-wilson-thinks-the-us-needs-to-be-like-australia-in-terms-of-gun-control/story-fnk853hr-1227457623755"], "published": "2015-07-27T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:15:12.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
