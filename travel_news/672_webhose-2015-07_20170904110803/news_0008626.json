Its low-rise brick warehouses with unobstructed views of the downtown skyline were seen as attractive and affordable for restaurants and residents willing to put up with truck traffic from wholesalers. But in the past year, the area has rapidly developed as not just a place to taxi in for a trendy meal, but to stay a while.\nLast summer, the West Loop got its first boutique hotel, Soho House Chicago ( sohohousechicago.com ), catering to artistic types working and networking in the area. The stylish 42-room building houses two restaurants open to the public, but most of the five-story former factory, including a rooftop pool, deluxe gym with a boxing ring and private lounge, is reserved for hotel guests and club members (the London chain restricts membership to those in “creative” fields).\nPhoto The lobby of Soho House Chicago, a hotel and club in the West Loop. Credit Kevin Miyazaki/Redux for The New York Times “We loved the fact that you could sit on that roof and see the entire beautiful skyline and you can’t see it in the Loop,” said Nick Jones, the founder and managing director of Soho House, of which there are 14 outposts.\nThe West Loop’s proximity to downtown attractions was enhanced three years ago when the Chicago Transit Authority opened an elevated “L” train stop on Morgan and Lake Streets, offering residents and visitors easy access to traditionally popular tourist areas of the city, including Millennium Park, home to video screen fountains and a Frank Gehry-designed outdoor theater.\nOne year later Tremaine Atkinson opened CH Distillery & Cocktail Bar ( chdistillery.com ), a sleek 48-seat bar with views behind glass of gleaming stills that produce his grain-to-bottle booze. He said he got his long-term lease at an opportune time.\nPhoto Pizza with burrata and black olives at Pizza East in Soho House.

Established hits include Next ( nextrestaurant.com ) from the chef Grant Achatz, which changes concepts each quarter; Girl and the Goat ( girlandthegoat.com ) from Stephanie Izard, who champions seasonal American cooking; and Graham Elliott Bistro ( gebistro.com ) from the chef who also oversees culinary operations at the popular music fest Lollapalooza .\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Some newcomers include Momotaro ( momotarochicago.com ), a sprawling Japanese restaurant with a drinks-and-snacks-focused izakaya on the lower level, a sushi island on the main floor and an encyclopedic menu. Tête Charcuterie ( tetechicago.com ) specializes in house-made pâtés and cured meats. The Betty ( thebettychicago.com ) offers a mostly small-plate menu and thoughtful cocktails in a vintage-inspired barroom that stays open late to attract area chefs after their kitchens close.\nPhoto Shrimp served artistically at Next, which changes concepts each quarter.

A link in the Ace Hotels chain of Portland, Ore., is to be built across the street. Developers have presented plans for an 83-room Nobu Hotel nearby, with a 10,000-square-foot restaurant.\nAs a measure of all the construction in the district, parking is harder to find by day, during builders’ hours, than at night, when valet parkers stake out most of the corners on the Randolph Street thoroughfare. But daytime traffic is nothing compared with the evening swarms.\nDonnie Madia was an early West Loop restaurant pioneer when he, the chef Paul Kahan and partners opened the popular Blackbird ( blackbirdrestaurant.com ) in 1997. Their company, One Off Hospitality Group, now operates four restaurants in the West Loop.\nHe calls the real estate market of the past two years a “frenzy,” adding, “It’s no longer Chicago restaurants and chefs, but people around the country who want to come and take a bite out of the West Loop and negotiate a lease.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUPSUB1/26HEADSUPSUB1-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUPSUB1/26HEADSUPSUB1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUP3/26HEADSUP3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUP4/26HEADSUP4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUP4/26HEADSUP4-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26HEADSUP3/26HEADSUP3-articleLarge.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-22T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T16:05:13.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
