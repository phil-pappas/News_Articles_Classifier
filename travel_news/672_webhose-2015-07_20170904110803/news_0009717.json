Rapinoe. Solo. Wambach.\nRemember those names.\nJust as players known simply as Maradona and Pelé changed the perception of this international sport in the last century, a new class of gifted athletes is putting women’s soccer on the map.\nThe U.S. women’s national team dazzled a global audience Sunday evening by beating Japan 5-2 in the Women’s World Cup final. Make no mistake, this was the kind of win that inspires a generation of young athletes to dream big and work hard.\nSoccer-crazed Seattle fans were among the masses who cheered as Carli Lloyd booted her way into sports history by scoring the fastest hat trick — three goals in a single game — within a mere 16 minutes. No one has ever accomplished such a feat in World Cup history, man or woman.\nOf course, this is a team sport and Lloyd’s first goal came off a corner kick from Seattle Reign FC’s own Megan Rapinoe.\nBetween the posts and save after save, Hope Solo showed why she is the best goalkeeper in the world. The Richland native, former University of Washington standout and current member of the Reign has had personal troubles off the field, but she earned the Golden Glove award fair and square.\nWith Sunday’s win, whatever doubts people had about the viability of a women’s soccer league in the United States should be put to rest.\nDiscussions should continue on the wide pay disparity that exists between male and female soccer players.” Fox Sports reported a new ratings high for a soccer telecast — a 77 percent boost over ESPN’s telecast of the last Women’s World Cup against Japan in 2011. Nearly 9 million people posted on social media about the game’s magnificent start, Lloyd’s improbable goal from midfield and a plethora of other themes that storybook games are made of.\nDiscussions should continue on the wide pay disparity that exists between male and female soccer players. And the next time women demand to play on real grass instead of artificial turf, FIFA officials should listen rather than shrug their shoulders.\nFor now, let’s celebrate this American team’s hard-earned victory for female athletes everywhere.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
