The man who caught it is a local fishermen named Bang Meng,\" explains Supaporn Anuchiracheeva, a representative of Earth Net Foundation, as she picks the threadfin fish from an ice tray. Then she continued with the detailed background of the catch. \n\"Bang Meng uses traditional fishing gear, called bett rao , or a hook-and-line fishing rod, to catch this individual fish. We need to thank this small fisherman for using this least destructive type of fishing gear. He brings us food and helps save the sea at the same time.\" \nThe scene was not a cooking class. Gathering around Supaporn were seafood lovers who attended the \"Kin Pla Raksa Talay\" (Eat Fish And Save The Sea) event that promotes organic seafood held last month at Krua Saijai, an organic restaurant in Vibhavadi 22. \nThe event is one of the activities under the \"Small-scale Fishery Organic Fishery Products\" (SSOF) sustainable organic seafood project. SSOF was created in January of 2013 by the Earth Net Foundation, with the European Union as the sponsor. The programme aims to promote sustainable seafood supplied by responsible small-scale fishermen, as an alternative to the produce supplied by big commercial fishing boats. \nNews about the dark connections between seafood and illegal activities, from environmental destruction to human trafficking, has caught Thailand off guard in recent months. With this in mind, knowing the name of the person who caught the fish you're about to eat seems like a privilege. \nOver the past two years, SSOF has opened a kiosk selling organic seafood at the Bangkok Farmers Market in Ekamai during weekends. It also takes pre-orders by email and phone. Organic and sustainable seafood are gaining popularity among health-conscious — and many socially-conscious — consumers in Bangkok. \nChemical free and fresh, the products however may not be fit for consumers used to readily available supermarket fare. \n\"I need to warn my customers. If there is a storm, there might be no fish to sell because the fishermen cannot go to sea,\" says Supaporn, a PhD graduate on tropical coastal zone management from the Asian Institute of Technology who also helps run the kiosk. Becoming a fish vendor has been an eye-opening experience for the 52-year-old veteran conservationist. \n\"The urban consumers are different from the local fishermen and conservationists that I have been working with. But we share the same dream that everyone should be entitled to products that are good for our heath, our environment and society.\" \nSince running the shop, the newbie fish vendor has learned to manage supply and demand, how to serve customers and lure them in by telling them the story about the seafood products on the ice trays. \n\"We are trying to connect seafood consumers in Bangkok with the fishermen. Our goal is to make consumers in Bangkok think of local fishermen when they eat seafood products, or at least question the origins of their food and how the fish has been caught.\" \nSSOF has 400 members from five fishing villages in Phetchaburi, Songkhla, Krabi, Phangnga and Phatthalung provinces. \nSo far, there are around 200 regular consumers. These regular customers include local hotels such as Plaza Athenee and pro-sustainable food restaurants like Bo.lan, an internationally-known venue. \nSSOF has also got a new boost. Earlier this month, its products and supply chain received the official seal given by the Organic Agriculture Certification Thailand (ACT), a well-respected third-party institute that provides auditing services to food exporters and local restaurants and hotels. The SSOF has thus become the first organic wild-caught seafood supplier in Thailand. \nTo get this organic label from the ACT, fishermen, fishing gear and methods must be registered as ACT organic seafood harvesters. The whole supply chain — from seafood harvesting to the logistics process — must be inspected by ACT auditors to ensure that production is chemical free and does not involve destructive fishing methods, illegal labour or unfair trade. \nThe project will now try to expand its market base into restaurants and hotels that share the same ideology, as well as public hospitals. In the future, SSOF's organic seafood plans include a social enterprise or a series of co-operatives owned by local fishermen and non-profit bodies. \nSupaporn then will conduct the research on business models for sustainable products based on her experiences in the project. She hopes the seafood project will create markets for small-scale fishermen to reach city consumers in future. \"It is not just selling fish. We are experimenting with a new business model that hopefully will be copied in the future.\" The SSOF's organic seafood is available weekly at the Bangkok Farmers Market venue at Gateway at Ekamai BTS station, from Friday to Sunday.
