I think it is fair to say, my view is that neither Greece nor China is going to cause any issue for us,” TCS CEO N Chandrasekaran said while sharing the results.\nThe overall momentum is very strong, deals have been pretty strong across industries and across geographies and key markets and verticals are robust, he said.\nThe recent rout in Shanghai shares and fears of Greek’s eurozone exit have been a matter of concern for investors.\nRelative to the US and Europe, China accounts for a very small share of business for TCS.\nChandrasekaran said key markets like North America are doing good and that revenue from the region grew 4.3 per cent.\nTCS, which kicked off the earnings season on Thursday, reported a meagre 2.1 per cent growth in the June quarter net profit at Rs 5,684 crore, with revenue growth trailing street expectations on difficulties from the Japanese and Latin American markets.\nThe software major reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 25,668 crore under Indian Gaap accounting, which is up 16.1 per cent on yearly basis and 6 per cent sequentially.\nFor Updates Check Company News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 3:13 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-10T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:57:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
