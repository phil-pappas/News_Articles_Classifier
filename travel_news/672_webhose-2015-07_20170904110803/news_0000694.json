Here you can see whales, glaciers, mountains and waterfalls, in an experience of a lifetime \nThe Arctic Circle holds a mystical wonder to those of us who live in a more temperate climate. The desire to visit and explore this majestic, wild and incredibly beautiful part of the world is a deeply held wish for many. The Arctic Circle is still wild and untamed, and here, people pit their wits against the harsh conditions and live in harmony with the immense landscape and incredible wildlife. \nThere are many ways to visit this alluring part of the world, but perhaps none are better than the unique bespoke activity holidays available in Norway. \nExhilarating Landscape \nDeep within the Arctic Circle of Norway is the Lyngen Peninsula. It has a dramatic, exhilarating landscape and there are various activities in both summer and winter to suit your individual taste. There are impressive mountain ranges, glaciers, cascading rivers and waterfalls, as well as the wonderfully tranquil, 82 km long, Lyngen Fjord. This expanse of pristine water is surrounded by 1,000ft mountains that rise full of grandeur from the fjord. To reach this majestic location from Tromsø airport takes about 2 ½ hours, using a combination of road and ferry. When you step out of the car, you will be met with stunning scenery, and an undeniable tranquillity, allowing you to feel instantly refreshed and relaxed – and ready to discover the delights surrounding you. Activity holidays to this region offer a chance to try new and exciting adventures with knowledgeable and experienced local guides. \nChoice of Arctic Adventures \nIf you visit in the summer months, from May to September, you will find a cool climate. The warmest months are June, July and August, when daytime temperatures range from 10 - 15º C. Occasionally, temperatures can reach 24ºC in July and August, but the nights are much colder. It's important to liaise with your tour operator beforehand, so they can advise on clothing and all the different types of adventures that arctic activity holidays can bring, including hiking, water sports and sea safaris. \nHiking \nIf you choose to go hiking in this region, you'll encounter forests of spruce and some deciduous trees. This is because the area is protected to some degree by the Lyngen Alps, which surround this special place. You will also get a chance to explore glaciers up close and personal. There is a wealth of wildlife, with reindeer in the summer months as well as elk, wolverines and lynx - although these animals are very shy. You are more likely to spot the thousands of migratory birds who come here each year for the summer months. These species will include buntings, waxwings, golden and sea eagles, as well as a variety of wading birds. The tundra flowers at this time of year and many birds will nest here before returning to the milder south in the winter. \nIf you choose a good company to book activity holidays, you can create a bespoke, flexible itinerary, encompassing all the different things you want to experience – on your own terms. \nWhales and Water Sports \nLyngen fjord is famous for the whales that come each year to feed on the krill and small fish. If you are very lucky, sometimes it is possible to see Humpback, Minky and Orca whales, but they do not come here every year - for reasons unknown. You will, however, get to see dolphins, harbour porpoises and Springer Whales, as they are common all around the coast. Even while you're kayaking or out on a catamaran you will get to see dolphins leaping and playing in the surrounding waters. \nThere are so many other experiences waiting to be enjoyed in this fantastic region, including the magical midnight sun from 20th May to the 22nd July. Holidaying high in the Arctic Circle will take you on an unforgettable, new and exciting adventure, which will stay with you forever.   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada.
