It’s a hard pick. Source: Supplied \nIT’S the famous city of skyscrapers, with a buzzing night-life and an even bigger food scene. \nHong Kong is a city that loves to eat with more than 12,000 restaurants packed into the tiny territory. \nAs one of the most densely populated places on Earth it has earnt its reputation as the culinary capital of Asia. But the traditional food scene in Hong Kong is changing. A new wave of foreign chefs have entered the market bringing with them bold concepts that experiment with traditional Chinese dishes. \nThink Yunan style steak tartare, or prawn toast piled high with shaved cabbage and mayonnaise. This fusion of Eastern and Western influences is having a dramatic impact on the dining scene as chefs compete to bring something new to the market.

His restaurant, Spice Temple, in Sydney and Melbourne represents everything he loves about the intricate Asian cuisine. \nFor the last 20 years Perry has visited Hong Kong at least annually looking for inspiration, new flavours and styles for the Qantas menus and his Rockpool Group.

Having two Chinese restaurants there’s no better place for me to come for inspiration than Hong Kong. Every time I’m here I walk away with a new inspiration for a dish or just a new amount of energy. I love the passion of Chinese cooking,” he says. \nLike the restaurant scene, Perry says that the way you shop for produce in Hong Kong is changing too. The 160 year old Graham Street wet market where you’ll find stalls of fresh fruit, vegetables, meat and seafood, has been drastically reduced to a few winding streets, a victim of the prime real estate it sits on. \n“In about five years time they won’t be exist” Perry said. “Sadly, they’re being reclaimed for luxury housing and so if you’re visiting they are an absolute must-see. A slice of old Hong Kong and a glimpse into local cuisine”. The wet markets are slowly disappearing from central Hong Kong. Source: Supplied \nHowever despite this new wave of dining, a place for traditional Chinese restaurants will always remain. The famous classic dishes such as Peking duck, barbecue suckling pig and roast goose will always be synonymous with Chinese cooking. But what’s interesting to see is the modern twist being applied to these recipes. \nHere are six restaurants, both traditional and modern, defining Hong Kong’s dining scene. \nLung King Heen , Four Seasons Hotel \nHong Kong’s only Michelin three starred restaurant, dining at the Four Season Hotel is nothing but incredibly special. “It is the best yum cha in the world,” says Perry who points out the lightest of pastries and the most delicate dumplings. \nTheir signature steamed shrimp and crabmeat dumpling (the world’s best dumpling) is served in its own basket and comes topped with a gold leaf and it’s the one dish you must try. \nThe chicken and truffle spring roll with its delicate crisp pastry is also a standout.

Spring Moon is also thought to be the brains behind the famous XO sauce. Their secret recipe is a combination of dried shrimp, dried scallops, garlic and chilli. \nStandout dishes include pan-fried garoupa fillet with supreme soy and the steamed Sicilian shrimp and minced pork dumpling.

Served splayed on all fours, the pig is delicately carved up in traditional Cantonese style. Other classics include salt-baked chicken and winter melon soup.
