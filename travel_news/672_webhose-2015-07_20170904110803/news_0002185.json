The new Cuban itineraries will comply with U.S. Department of Treasury rules that allow licensed travel companies to transport approved travelers to Cuba to engage in activities that support the Cuban people, including cultural, artistic, faith-based and humanitarian exchanges.\nIf you book, don’t expect a casino or Broadway shows — instead, plan to be immersed in the Cuban culture, with onboard activities geared toward the experiences awaiting travelers in that country. Also plan to spend about eight hours “on the ground” while in port, involved in various social impact activities.\nThe 2,120-guest MSC Opera completed dry dock this month and will head to Cuba in December to offer seven-night cruises from Havana. (Contributed by MSC Cruises) The family can come along, but guests must be at least 8 years old to sail on Adonia, according to the cruise line’s website.\nTara Russell, president of Fathom, said the line is investigating “11 ports of promise” on the island, and plans are to include three different ports on each sailing.\nPrices for seven-day itineraries to Cuba start at $2,990 per person, excluding taxes, port and other government and related fees, and including all meals on the ship, onboard social impact immersion experiences and certain on-the-ground cultural immersion activities. Bookings are open now, although Carnival Corp. is awaiting final approval by the Cuban authorities.\nMSC Opera will homeport in Havana for the winter 2015-2016 season, offering seven-night cruises to Montego Bay, Grand Cayman and Cozumel, along with a two-night stay in the Cuban capital.
