A small pile of surfing magazines sits on a low table beneath Reynolds, who is photographed smiling and shirtless eating the warung’s standard fare: nasi campur (mixed rice).\nVillagers – cattlemen, rice farmers and miners – share the restaurant’s four tables with the handful of hungry surfers who have come to ride the perfectly formed waves that break in the crystalline bays either side of Sekonkang, which is in the southwest corner of Sumbawa – an island in the middle of the Indonesian archipelago.\nWhat they seek are the breaks called Supersuck, Yo-yo’s, Big Brother, Little Bingin and Scar Reef. What they find is paradise: perfect sunsets, beaches fringed by reef with warm turquoise water and white sand of crushed coral. A hinterland of steamy jungle, rice fields, banana groves to explore by motorbike and wayside fruit stalls selling rambutans, dragon fruit and coconuts.\nGoogle Sumbawa’s west coast and only surf blogs appear, promising “world-class waves”, “epic surf” and a “true surf resort ... where you can safely travel with your wife”. The waves justify their online fame and surf mag photo spreads.\nJose Gutierrez, who now runs the booking and promotional side of Nomad Tropical Surf Resort, remembers the first time he laid eyes on the place as a visitor in 2009. A perfect left-hander (named after the resort, as is the beach) peeled for hundreds of metres along the reef. “I looked out and I saw this wave break and I was like, whoa,” he says. “I thought let’s stay here.” Checking the surf at Tropical Beach. Picture: Tom Westbrook Source: Supplied\nHe reckons Sumbawa’s southwest is what Bali was like 40 years ago, only the locals are even friendlier. “It’s still very virgin compared to Bali,” he says.\n“Here, it’s very clean and there’s no crowds and the temperature is a bit cooler than Bali, it’s not as hot and humid.”\nIt is much less developed but also more refreshing compared with the heavily visited Bali and Lombok. There are no touts, no rubbish in the water and no hard sell to be found anywhere.\nAll the waves are reef breaks, meaning they crash on to coral and rocks about 100m from the sand. They have some size to them and the surfers take their surfing seriously.\nMy attempt to borrow a bodyboard from a Frenchman for a quick wave is strongly rebuffed, though he adds that the waves are the best he’s ever surfed. No amount of scrounging locally could turn one up either, it is a case of BYO.\nBut if you do arrive without a board, it’s not exactly hard to have a good time in such sublime surroundings. And with the surfers out on the breaks, you have the place to yourself.\nPicking up a motorcycle for $5 a day is a matter of asking at any guesthouse or hotel and is definitely the best way to get around. In typical Indonesian style, it’s a “no paperwork, no worries” affair – bring it back and pay when you’re done, next day or next week, no problem. And it comes with a homemade surfboard rack. Fuel up on Nasi campur (mixed rice) after a day in the surf.

Accommodation ranging from $10 a night to more than $300 is spaced out along Rantung and Tropical, with non-beachfront options available in Maluk.\nRantung, Tropical and a deserted sandy strip north of Rantung are the pick of the beaches and are five minutes apart by motorcycle. At Tropical, it’s no hardship to be confined to the shallows in front of the resort. The water inside the reef is calm and flat and it’s so warm, there’s no need to get out.\nFrom the shore the surfers are specks on the horizon. A brightly coloured fishing boat is parked on the sand and the beach is framed by a sharp volcanic headland covered in brilliant green jungle.\nLooking back on the beach from the water, everything is dwarfed by the mountains that rise behind the dunes and a vast sky. At Rantung beach, in a wide, shallow bay, the setup is similar. Surfers are out on the reefs leaving a long sandy beach, a lagoon and two little islands for board-free visitors to explore. By night, fishermen cast lines in to the sea and light little driftwood fires to barbecue their catch.\nFor a deserted beach, follow a dirt path west from Sekonkang.\nThe only thing that can pull many of the surfers from the waves is a feed. It’s paradise in the water but also at the table with a cold beer and authentic Indonesian cooking. While decent burgers and Western fare are on offer at the beachfront hotels, a ride into town for a local meal is worth the trip.\nThe warungs are basic with just a handful of tables. There are no watered-down curries here, the flavours are as big as the waves and the spice levels are high. Behind a glass display cabinet are bowls filled with a line-up that changes each day.

Picture: Tom Westbrook Source: Supplied\nPerhaps whole grilled fish topped with a fiery sambal, ayam goreng (fried chicken), greens stir-fried with ground shrimp and coconut, mee goreng (fried noodles) slick with chilli oil, spicy eggplant, omelet, beef rendang and more.\nPoint to what you want and your choices are spooned on to a big plate of steamed rice – exactly the kind of meal you want after hours at the beach, and for just a few dollars.\nThe women in the warung pile the plates of the surfers especially high, and are known to refill them. Tanned Aussies who look like they might do a dozen Weet-Bix, tattooed Americans, bleach-haired Icelandics and Frenchmen sporting reef injuries all hunch over their plates, wolfing down the food and swapping surf stories.\nThose who can’t take their eyes off the waves get their nasi campur to take away, wrapped up in waxy paper, slipped into a plastic bag and hung over the handles of motorbikes, to be eaten by the beach.\nWash it down with a shockingly purple dragon fruit juice and a few Indonesian doughnuts heavily dusted in icing sugar. Made fresh daily, the secret ingredient in the dough is potato, and the result is fluffy and hard to resist.\nBy day’s end, the only place to be is beachside, watching the sun sink in to the sea.\nThe sky turns bright pink, then purple and blue with the gloaming, reflected in the still water held by the reef at low tide, while thoughts turn to Bintangs and staying an extra night.\nGO2\nSUMBAWA\nGETTING THERE\nThe easiest way to reach west Sumbawa is the fast boat from Lombok to Maluk. It leaves from a terminal at Labuan Lombok, which is two hours by taxi from Lombok airport. Fly to Lombok from Australia, with one transfer, on Air Asia, Singapore Airlines, Garuda Indonesia or Virgin.\nQantas, Jetstar, Virgin, Garuda and Air Asia all also fly directly from Australian capitals to Bali. From there it is half an hour by plane to Lombok.\nSTAYING THERE\nChoose from surf-camp style accommodation at Yo-yo’s or Rantung Beach Hotel (62 878 3905 4999), modest beach bungalows at Santai, luxe beachfront bungalows at Rantung Restaurant and Cottages or the resort experience at Nomad Tropical ( nomadsurfresorts.com ).", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/27/1227458/680872-a6cfe7a4-2eb5-11e5-8f23-6a4d2e87f30f.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/27/1227458/680453-b0bf55e2-2eb5-11e5-8f23-6a4d2e87f30f.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/27/1227458/680373-af1b234c-2eb5-11e5-8f23-6a4d2e87f30f.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:13:38.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
