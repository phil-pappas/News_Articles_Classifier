By Bob Batz Jr. PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE • Sunday July 26, 2015 5:00 AM \nCUMBERLAND, Md. — A visit to this small western Maryland city really can be like a trip back in time, and not just because you can ride on a train pulled by a working steam locomotive. \nThat acclaimed attraction, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, is what drew us to take our almost-8-year-old son on a trip this month. \nWe strolled along the bricks of the pedestrian walkway that is Baltimore Street, the charming heart of Cumberland’s downtown. \nAt lunchtime, we ate at Curtis’ Famous Weiners on N. Liberty Street. \nCurtis has been serving hot dogs with meat sauce, minced onions and mustard since 1918. The place seems little changed, including the prices. We ordered three wieners, fries and a cherry Coke from a short menu. \nWe loved watching proprietor Gino Giatras lining up dogs on his arm to dress them and servers deftly wrapping them in wax paper. The bill was barely $12, which included a fourth wiener we couldn’t resist splitting. \nThe city (population about 20,000) looks like a model-railroad town, crisscrossed with train tracks and bridges crossing Will’s Creek and the Potomac River, with plenty of steeples and pretty old buildings and homes on its hills and the blue-green Alleghenies rising up all around. \nOne red-brick landmark is the former Western Maryland Railway station, built in 1913. It’s the centerpiece of Canal Place, which celebrates the history of this onetime “gateway to the West.” \nThe Western Maryland Scenic Railroad uses steam engine 734 to pull some of its excursion trains that run between Cumberland and Frostburg, Md. \nThe three-hour, 32-mile round trip operates from May to December. \nA plume of black smoke announced the approach of the steam locomotive as it crossed the Potomac from its base in Ridgeley, W.Va. \nThe engine was a spectacle, especially as it eased up to the station and stopped in a cloud of white steam that swirled around spectators’ legs. We were fascinated standing beside this hissing, growling giant while its tender filled with water for the trip. \nPlenty of tourist trains operate but relatively few use antique steam locomotives, in part because they are expensive to restore and maintain. \nAfter we watched an engineer work his oil can over 734, the conductor called “All aboard!” and we filed to our bench seats. \nThe mountain scenery on the trip is spectacular, especially when viewed out of the open windows between cars. \nBut just like in the olden days, you risk getting cinders in your eyes from coal smoke. Certainly, you’ll have black powder on your shoulders. \nBefore we knew it, we were pulling up to the pretty depot in Frostburg, where we were met by a Civil War re-enactor and others in period costumes. \nPassengers disembarked to watch the steam locomotive get turned around on a big turntable for the return trip. \nWe had about an hour to explore Frostburg, and free admission with our train tickets to the Thresher Carriage Museum at the depot. \nBut it was lunchtime, so we made a beeline for the Trail Inn Bed & Breakfast just across the tracks, which offers train passengers an express menu for $9.99 — your choice of pulled pork, beef brisket or broasted chicken and two side dishes. \nThe trip back was uneventful and relaxing as the train rocked and swayed on the slow downhill run, every now and then blowing its steam whistle for motorists, cyclists and spectators along the route. We could better hear some of the narration over the speakers, and I was glad to look to the right in time to see the opening for Bone Cave, a treasure-trove found in 1912 full of fossils that date back about 200,000 years. \nWe arrived in Cumberland just after 3 p.m. and, like many other passengers, we lingered to take photos and videos of the locomotive before returning to the 21st century.
