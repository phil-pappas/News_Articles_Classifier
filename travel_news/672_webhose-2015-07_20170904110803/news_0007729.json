On July 20, the longtime Cold War foes reopened embassies in each other’s countries.\nA U.S. trade embargo remains in effect, however, with opposition to lifting it strong in the Republican-dominated U.S. Congress.\nThe U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo on the southeastern tip of Cuba is now best know for a U.S. prison holding suspected violent militants. Cuba says the base is illegally occupied.\nPresident Obama made the closure of the controversial offshore prison a priority when he took office in 2009, but the plan has faced numerous setbacks, including Congress blocking the transfer of detainees to U.S. prisons. Last week, a White House spokesman said the Obama administration is in the “final stages” of a plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\nMembers of Batista’s army ready for action after an attack on the Moncada garrison by a group led by Fidel Castro on July 26, 1953.\nAFP\nHuman rights doubts\nWashington says it is mindful of human rights concerns in Cuba, the only communist-run, single-party state across the Americas.\nBut it appears for now to have stopped conditioning bilateral relations on changes it unsuccessfully pressed for over five decades.\nYears after the Cold War melt, Cuba still allows only one political party, does not have a free press and cracks down on public assembly it deems worrisome.\nRaúl Castro, 84, has said he will step aside in 2018, and has named his communist successor, Miguel Díaz-Canel, 55.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:08:12.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
