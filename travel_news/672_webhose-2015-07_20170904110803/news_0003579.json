Just strolling the Old Town, you'll see bastions, fortifications and architecture that dates back to as early as the 1600's. \nBut Quebec City attractions are more than a history lesson, eating in Quebec City is an attraction in itself; be sure to partake. 1.

Dating back to 1820, the citadel is a relic of British occupation and today serves as official residences of the Royal 22e Régiment and the Governor General of Canada , a museum and popular tourist attraction. During the summer months, visitors can watch military traditions, such as the Changing of the Guard. More » 2.
