Despite the desperate circumstances, all of Oman Air’s staff based at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport responded with vigour.\nPaul Gregorowitsch, Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, said:\n“I am pleased to say that the staff at Oman Air came forward whole heartedly to collect money to be sent for the rehabilitation of those devastated by the earthquake. We managed to collect close to RO 10,000. This has been handed over to the Oman Charitable Association, which is spearheading a campaign to help the victims of the Nepal earthquake.\n“On behalf of all my colleagues, I would like to thank Awena Al Fehdi and Al Azhar Al Zaabi for organising the fundraising campaign. I would also like to thank all those who donated. Our thoughts and good wishes go to the people of Nepal, as they recover from this disaster.”\nOman Air’s workforce, throughout the carrier’s international network, had expressed a strong desire to assist in meeting the needs of those affected by the earthquake. An appeal was launched to raise funds, and around RO 10,000 was raised.\nAwena Al Fehdi added:\n“Oman Air’s workforce, throughout the carrier’s international network, has expressed a strong desire to assist in meeting the needs of those affected by the earthquake. An appeal was launched to raise funds, which ran until 14th May and met with a very positive response. The collected amount was donated to humanitarian organisations in Nepal, through Oman Charitable Association.\n“This campaign follows previous appeals on behalf of those at home and overseas who have needed our help. I would like to thank all my colleagues, throughout Oman Air’s international network, for the generosity and support.”\nOman Air staff in Nepal showed admirable courage and great responsibility throughout this crisis. Despite many schedule changes and major congestion at the airport, Oman Air was able to resume its services between Kathmandu and Muscat on the day following the earthquake. This was only possible due to the commitment and combined efforts of Oman Air’s Airport Team, working in close coordination with the air traffic control colleagues and officials of other companies and authorities.\nRelated Posts MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
