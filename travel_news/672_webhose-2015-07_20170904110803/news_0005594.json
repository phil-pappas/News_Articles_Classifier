However, there are events unfolding that are drawing attention to Cuba that will have a significant effect on the nation's growth as a travel destination.\nUnited States President Barrack Obama is opening the door to better relations with Cuba. The reopening of embassies after decades of Cold war diplomacy is changing the dynamic and the changes are moving faster than many would have expected.\nCP\nPeople enjoy an artificial beach as a car drives by on the Malecon as part off a collective artistic intervention named �Behind The Wall� in Havana, Cuba, Thursday, May 21, 2015.

(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan) \nThe impact of all the press that has been disseminated, both for and against the recent U.S. announcement has raised the awareness levels of Cuba and its attributes well beyond the borders of America.\nIn its early developmental years, Cuba tourism was primarily based around a price proposition that promised beautiful beaches, acceptable accommodation, and three reasonably good meals. In those early years many of the first guests were actually housed in homes once owned by Americans and confiscated following the Castro revolution. Meals were served at central dining areas up to two blocks away from these homes. That all changed rapidly as Canadian and other national hospitality and resort companies jumped at the opportunity to partner with a Cuban government hungry for foreign currency.\nWhile Cuba today is still somewhat less expensive than many of the similar brand resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean, the savings are not what they were. But neither is the quality and service, as training and a commitment to creating a repeatable and expandable consumer traffic pattern has led to building of a series of all-inclusive resort options which are as good as anywhere else.\nFor some, until now, the destination was a sanctuary for those who wanted to go where Americans weren't. But that is changing quickly. With the recent thaw in U.S.- Cuban relations, it was expected more Americans would visit the nation under the new rules that opened the door to those visiting the country for cultural, artistic, faith-based and humanitarian exchanges.\nThe definition can be broad, and one travel company is ready to test the rules in what is an interesting travel mode. Carnival Corp., which controls a multitude of cruise brands, has just received approval to offer specialty cruises to Cuba. Under its recently launched Fathom brand, Carnival will start taking U.S. passengers to Cuba as early as April, 2016. Carnival Corp. has won approval from the U.S. departments of treasure and commerce to begin passenger travel to Cuba. It is working closely with the United States treasury to make sure it sticks to the rules. Every week, they plan to take more than 700 passengers to the island to experience the country and support Cuban people. There is little doubt the venture will be anything but successful.\nA few years ago, the Canadian company Cuba Cruise started offering multiple Cuban port stops around the island. These trips offered a chance to see the island beyond the resort options being offered, which for the most part meant visitors chose to see much of the country beyond the city or region where their all-inclusives are mostly situated. I have never experienced the service but after a shaky start, recent reports seem favourable.\nStarting this December, MSC Cruises will be the first mainstream cruise line to select Cuba as its home port. This is a significant breakthrough. Not a small ship, the 2,120 passenger MSC Opera will initiate 16 Caribbean cruises that will take in a number of other countries including Mexico, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, while offering longer stays of almost three days in its new home port of Havana. Initially these cruises will be marketed in the United Kingdom only and open bookings through other channels once they are more established.\nManitobans tend to want to take their holidays in Cuba around the coldest months of the year. This year again, the major tour operators will all feature Cuba as a prime winter non-stop destination with a wide range of weekly departures to choose from. More and more Canadians are also taking advantage of the lower prices being offered at the same quality properties during the summer. For 2015, preliminary estimates suggest a 13 per cent growth in summer season bookings.\nIn a recent interview, Eloy Govea, the Cuba Tourist Board's director in Canada, says one of the reasons for that growth is that \"people want to go there before the U.S. travellers arrive.\"\nCuba is also perceived as a relatively safe destination. Vacationers concerned about travel advisories and reports of violence when considering a holiday in the sun will naturally seek affordable, alternative options.\nWhile most destination weddings are usually scheduled around the winter months, more couples are choosing to take advantage of lower price during spring and fall shoulder seasons and the summer months.\nThere are non-stop flights from Toronto to Cuba available year-round.\n\nForward your travel questions to askjourneys@journeystravel.com.
