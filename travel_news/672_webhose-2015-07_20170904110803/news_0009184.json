We have therefore been very careful to select a leader in David that passionately shares our values of putting customers and people first. This is an exciting new position for the company, as we look to further strengthen our position in the Australian market and further invest in the tools and support we provide our Travel Counsellors.” \nThis announcement comes after a host of recent investments by the company to enhance the support it offers to its Travel Counsellors in Australia, including more online and face-to-face training programmes and a continued focus on developing the in-house dynamic packaging technology, with agents now seeing record levels of margin and earnings growth as they become empowered to create their own tailor-made holidays through the system. \nCommenting on his role David says: “I am delighted and proud to become part of the Travel Counsellors team. Their strong focus on putting the customer and agents first and technology that is unmatched in the industry, provides a compelling and exciting proposition for agents to run their business from home as part of a global, leading customer focused business and culture. I am excited about building on the success to date in Australia and helping each and every Travel Counsellor realise their potential and positioning Travel Counsellors as the leading trusted travel brand for personalised travel planning and advice in the country.” \nWith over 1,400 professional Travel Counsellors operating their own home-based businesses across seven countries, Travel Counsellors has seen annual revenue growth in 2014 of $80m, taking global turnover to $850m, with average income per agent increasing by 10% in the past 12 months. \nSteve adds; “We are confident under David’s leadership in Australia we can support our agents even further in helping them deliver their truly unique service levels and enable them to earn the margins they deserve, whilst driving the long term strategic development of the business in the country.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:01:11.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
