It’s a city with a rich history that is experiencing a rebirth as a destination for young, creative people. Music has always been the driving force, but now creative agencies, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and stores are popping up everywhere. I heard good things about the design store Wilder and decided to check it out on a recent trip to the South. Owners Josh and Ivy Elrod relocated from Manhattan after two decades as New Yorkers. Josh is an artist and former member of the Blue Man Group; Ivy is an actress and former Rockette. The shop is very well done and responsible for introducing a lot of great brands to Nashville. The couple is bright, fun, and upbeat. They give the store a welcoming atmosphere that encourages sitting down for a chat before you make your purchase. I asked the Elrods about owning the store, educating consumers, and their Germantown neighborhood.\nYou have both done a lot of different things career-wise, mostly as performers. What made you decide to open a retail store?\nIVY ELROD: No one else would have us.\nJOSH ELROD: The simplest answer is that I had three surgeries in four years from performing. I knew it was time to do something else. We had been talking about it for a few years, and then this window opened up and we decided to jump. We crammed it in between moving to Nashville, having a second child, and buying a house.\nIE: The link for us is about creating environments, playing with\nspace—stuff that we both have always been turned on by. Also, the store has a way of connecting people and spawning community, which sounds terrifying but which we’re also all about.\nWilder sells a wide range of stuff: furniture from Garza Marfa, pencil holders from Doug Johnston, and incense from Blackbird. Do you feel a responsibility to introduce your customers to things they have maybe never seen before?\nJE: I cringe at the thought of having more responsibilities than I already do. For me, the driving force behind what we carry, and what we try to do, is “Am I excited about this?” I get really obsessed with certain things and I want to share them with people.\nIE: Yeah, I think it’s more like an enthusiasm—we like being so hyped on something that we freak out about it.\nThe store is in Germantown. What do you love about the neighborhood? How does it feel to be part of the creative community in Nashville?\nJE: Germantown feels like one of the few truly walkable neighborhoods in Nashville. Coming from New York back to my hometown, we were keen on finding something that had that street-life feel. I love the mix of old homes and newer ones, artists working in the Taylor Building, the farmers’ market, and great restaurants.\nI love the creative community here. People really seem down to help one another, and there’s a compelling mix of musicians, visual artists, designers, and makers that feels uniquely Nashville to me.\nIE: The scariest part of moving to Nashville from NYC was the loss of the creative community we felt so deeply entrenched in from all that time in New York. I’m psyched to say that all the collaborations we’ve gotten to do down here have grown organically from the relationships we’ve built from the shop. Nomad Collective, Electra Eggleston, and now Pennyweight—these projects have all been born from conversations that started here…and interestingly, all businesses led by women. So basically, we’re deep in with the Nashville creative community and we’re all women.
