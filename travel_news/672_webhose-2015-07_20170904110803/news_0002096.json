Whether city centre or deep in the Tuscan hills, each features a unique collection of artistic pieces ranging from modern art, photography, antique furnishings and bespoke painted floors to fairy-tale surroundings that would inspire the artist in us all. Once again SLH spoils its guests with the luxury of choice.\nRomeo Hotel, Naples, Italy\nBehind the sleek, glass façade of this Kenzo Tang & Associates-designed hotel, guests will discover designer furnishings, modern art, vintage pieces and photography collections by Neapolitan photographers including Monica Biancardi and Antonio Biasiucci. The hotel’s location on the waterfront near Naples’ vibrant historic centre, means that guests can also enjoy wonderful views of Mt. Vesuvius, Capri and the Sorrento Coast, particularly from the glass-fronted rooftop pool. The art continues in the restaurants with guests treated to eye-catching dishes in the Michelin-starred Il Comandante and dining at a marble water fountain counter amongst Japanese antiques from the Edo era at Romeo Sushi. Meanwhile the new 10,000 sq. ft. Dogana del Sale spa fuses science and technology and features an Infrared Sauna. Double rooms are available from €235 per night.\nCastello di Vicarello, Tuscany, Italy\nTucked away in the Tuscan hills, Castello di Vicarello perfects off-the-beaten-track luxury with history in every stone. Each of the seven suites in this medieval castle offers a different experience: the Chinese Room features a beautiful Chinese bed from the island of Madura; Suite Giardino Segreto an antique four poster bed and terracotta stove; Suite Vicario an open stone fireplace and copper bathtub; Suite Villa Chiesina, originally the Castle’s Church, a private pergola; all complemented by bold, modern artworks. Foodies will relish the private cookery courses, using fresh produce picked from the hotel grounds, especially in autumn when the olives, mushrooms and grapes from the Castle’s own vineyard are harvested. Double rooms are available from €520 per night.\nAgalia Luxury Suites, Ios, Greece\nThe fourteen suites at Agalia Luxury Suites are individually decorated in a palette of blues and greens to reflect the turquoise sea and rolling hills that wrap around this island retreat. Inside whitewashed walls and arches accentuated by local marble and stones hint at traditional Cycladic style while original artwork adds a contemporary edge. The art doesn’t stop at the walls, however, as each suite also features a one-of-a-kind floor over which the beds appear to be suspended. Those who don’t have the luxury of one of the three private pool suites can relax by the fresh water pool, surrounded by palm trees and overlooking the sea, port and the town. As the day comes to a close, guests can salute the sun with regular yoga and meditation sessions in the grounds. Pool Suites are available from €198 per night.\nCastello Boutique Resort & Spa, Crete, Greece\nArtfully combining classical Cretan-style architecture with uber-cool interior design, the Castello Boutique Resort & Spa offers an adults-only retreat between the mountains and sea in this picturesque seaside village. The pure white buildings provide a striking contrast to the colourful tropical gardens and the fresh-water swimming pool, equipped with fibre-optic effects, transforms the terrace at night time. Many of the rooms offer a private pool or outdoor Jacuzzi, while all offer spacious private terraces and bathrooms complete with air baths and crystal cabin showers. Further relaxation is on offer at the Callista Spa with its menu of progressive treatments inspired by nature, including on a Zero1 Bed that creates a light wave sensation every 30 seconds accompanied by bespoke colour design. Junior Suites are available from €338 per night.\nDomaine des Etangs, Massignac, France\nThis meticulously restored chateau in the heart of the French countryside is bound to inspire guests to embrace their inner Monet with its elegant turrets and storybook landscape of waterways and woodland that can be explored by rowing boat or bicycle. The jewel in its crown, however, are the 29 rooms, varying from individual farm cottages dotted around the grounds and sleeping up to ten guests to the Suite Chateau, located in the tower with wonderful views over the gardens and ponds. Throughout, rich period features including original wooden beams and old stone walls are complimented by sumptuous furnishings and sleek glass partitions. The Dyades restaurant is influenced by produce grown on the estate in the vast vegetable garden in delicious seasonal dishes with special dining experiences available to guests including riverside picnics. Double rooms are available from €500 per night.\nRelated Posts Etihad Airways to boost frequency and capacity of flight to Athens and Larnaca Small Luxury Hotels of the World adds new hotels for summer 2015 Enjoy the attractive Easter deals with the last minute packages from Small Luxury Hotels of the World Royal Princess cruise cancelled owing to power outage Best ways to explore Italy without spending too much!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T07:47:14.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
