The 2015 edition of the Seychelles-India Celebrations which will be held from October 2-4 will this year fall within what is being described as a month-long India Fest. The Indian High Commissioner, HE Mr. Sanjay Panda, joined Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, at the Ministry's Offices at ESPACE Building for a meeting with the Seychelles-India Day Committee, and as a group they mapped out possible activities for this coming cultural celebration. \nAlso present at this meeting were Benjamine Rose, the PS for Culture; Jimmy Savy, the CEO of the National Arts Council; and Melissa Simeon from State House. \nMinister St.Ange commended the Seychellois Indian Community for their support and for their tireless work as a group to make this event what is expected of it. The Minister also thanked the Indian High Commissioner and India for their support for Seychelles and for the event that recognizes the hard work and devotion of one of the five historical groups that have helped make Seychelles what it is today. \"Our local Indian population have played a key part in creating the Seychelles we see and the Seychelles we have today. The political will is today opening doors for the more recognition of the importance of all the five branches that make us what we are. Let us remain united, let us work together and let us continue to think of the concept of 'One Seychelles â€“ One People' and all work to celebrate our routes and what we are today,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nDuring the meeting, the Indian High Commissioner confirmed to the gathered members of the Seychelles Indian Community that India would be working with them to ensure that the India Fest 2015 would be receiving the full support from India where the rich Indian culture would be showcased in Seychelles. \nThe committee is now working on a draft program for the 2015 edition of the Seychelles-India Day Celebrations, and they will also ensure an openness approach to include more of the local Indian community in the planning of this years' manifestations. \nMinister Alain St.Ange closed the meeting by announcing that the ministry was working to find the best way to recognize the founding fathers of Seychelles of Indian descent and also all those who have worked to help bring economic benefits to the Seychelles of today. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
