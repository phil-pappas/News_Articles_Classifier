Abta, the travel association, estimated yesterday that around 3,000 Britons are currently on holiday in Tunisia. The Foreign Office recommends returning to Britain as soon as possible . Contact your tour operator – they are running additional flights to repatriate travellers and will be able to advise you on arrangements. Independent travellers are strongly advised to take the next available flight home. Is my holiday cancelled? Probably. While a few smaller tour operators do visit countries “off-limits” to Britons (Wild Frontiers still run trips to Iran, for example), all major tour operators will follow the Foreign Office’s advice. Thomas Cook, Thomson and First Choice, three of the UK’s biggest travel firms, have cancelled all bookings until October 31. Contact your tour operator to be sure. Will I get a refund? Yes. Your tour operator is legally obliged to offer you a full refund or an alternative holiday if the Foreign Office advises against visiting a destination. However, their policies will vary. Legally, they are only obliged to offer the refund if you are due to the depart within 48 hours, although many - like those listed above - have already cancelled all trips until November. Contact them to discuss your options. What about an alternative holiday? Your tour operator will almost certainly want you to rebook to an alternative destination rather than cancel your trip outright. However, it should be noted that Tunisia is one of the Mediterranean’s cheaper package holiday destinations and alternative breaks will be few and far between so close to the peak summer period. If the alternative options offered by your tour operator are costlier than your original booking, you will be expected to pay the difference. Prior to yesterday’s Foreign Office warning, tour operators were already allowing those due to visit Tunisia to change their destination, and readers had contacted Telegraph Travel to complain about the extra cost of the alternatives on offer . One, Jennifer Gibbons from Winchester, had to pay £250 for a replacement trip to Turkey, even though her hotel had the same rating as the Tunisian resort she had been due to visit. A Thomson customer claimed she had to pay an additional £900 for a holiday to Cyprus, and a Thomas Cook traveller claimed he was charged £670 to amend his holiday. Your tour operator is legally obliged to offer you a full refund or an alternative holiday “We will do our best to offer suitable alternatives to the value-for-money option Tunisia represents,” a Thomson spokesperson said. The tour operator is allowing customers to transfer their Tunisia breaks to winter 2015/16 or summer 2016 “to take advantage of early booking offers”, but this would mean missing out on a holiday this year. If you are not offered an acceptable alternative, you can insist on a refund – but be warned that availability for this summer will be low. The hotel where last month's attack took place I’m due to visit later in the year – should I cancel? If your tour operator has not yet cancelled your trip – ie. if you are travelling after October 31 in the case of Thomas Cook, Thomson and First Choice customers – you will be liable to pay a fee if you choose to cancel. Abta recommends waiting until closer to the departure date before contacting your travel company “as the situation is fluid”. I have arranged an independent holiday – what should I do? If your flight hasn’t been cancelled, you can still travel. But take the Foreign Office advise very seriously. Abta warns that holidaymakers who travel out to Tunisia at this time are likely to invalidate their travel insurance policies. “Most insurance policies will still provide cover for travellers in a country at the time of Foreign Office advice change,” it adds. Will I get a refund for my independent trip? Your airline will be obliged to offer you a refund. However, if you have booked a hotel, a villa or other accommodation independently, your contract is directly with the hotel or villa and you are responsible for any cancellation. If you can’t get there, you will have to do your best to persuade them to give you a refund or rebook for a later date – but they are not obliged to do this and you may lose money. What about other arrangements I have paid for? If you have already paid for a hire car or excursion independently, you are still responsible for paying the bill. Am I covered by my travel insurance? A few policies have cover for a “consequential loss”, such as a hotel booking made independently. You will need to check the terms and conditions which apply to your policy directly with your insurer.
