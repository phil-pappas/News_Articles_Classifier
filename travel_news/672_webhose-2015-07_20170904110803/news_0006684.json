The airline also announced a new partnership with satellite WiFi innovator, ViaSat, to bring streaming video and a faster satellite-based WiFi platform to Virgin America's 10 new Airbus A320 aircraft beginning later this year. \n\"Earning the 'Top Domestic Airline' distinction in the Travel + Leisure for the eighth consecutive year is a tremendous honor – and reflects our continued commitment to delivering a 'guest-centric' travel experience on every flight through better design, technology and topnotch service,\" said David Cush, Virgin America President and CEO. \"This award expresses the opinions of the most experienced travelers – one of the largest surveys of its kind – and proves that we continue to offer the most consistent, upscale flight and travel experience in the U.S. market. Although the award is confirmation that we continue to hit the mark with real travelers – even at just eight years old – we're not standing still. We're continuing to make strategic investments in our product to stay ahead of the pack and to answer the needs of travelers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:54:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
