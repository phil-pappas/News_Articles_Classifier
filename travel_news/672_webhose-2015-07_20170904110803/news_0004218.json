A couple have gotten so big they've come across the Pacific, most dramatically Bonchon, an exploding concept that only launched in South Korea in 2002, emigrated to New Jersey four years later, and now has nearly 40 U.S. locations, plus about a hundred more across Asia and the Middle East. You can get your Bonchon fix in nine states plus the District of Columbia, especially in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and California, with Missouri and Ohio thrown in for good measure.\nBonchon is in the not-so-fast casual category and a bit unique, with a feel like Chipotle or Moe's but featuring both a takeout counter and full sit-down waiter service. All the food is made to order, so it's not speedy, even to go, but they do a big business in large wing platters which can be ordered in advance. It has a sleek, modern interior with stark wooden tables and chrome chairs with black leather pads. Presentation is surprisingly stylish, with fries served in a paper cone and the traditional Korean dish of bimimbap in a large, sizzling, attractive hot stone bowl. It also has a much larger menu than just chicken, and is really a Korean restaurant specializing in wings. Unlike most other eateries in this style, many Bonchon locations have bars and serve beer on draft and in bottles.\nReason to visit: Bonchon chicken, bulgogi sliders, rice cakes, takoyaki, bimimbap\nThe food: Bonchon's chicken is not a substitute for traditional Buffalo-style hot wings, but rather a different creature altogether. It is breaded but with a crunchy paper-thin shell, thanks to a signature twice-fried cooking method. Each is really half a wing, with a choice of drumettes or the wing bone portion, and all are served coated in a choice of two signature sauces, soy garlic or spicy, the latter made with Korean gochugaru, or ground dried red chili peppers for a sweet, smoky, spicy finish. One thing I really liked about the menu is that it is highly customizable, and you can order just wings, just drumettes, or several pre-set combos, and get all of these with either sauce or for variety, half and half. This makes it easy on the solo diner but is also perfect for sharing, with wings as main course or appetizer.\nThe quality is very high, and both the wing sauces for all the Bonchon outlets worldwide are made in the main Seoul factory, so the flavor is very consistent. The wings are cooked to order, and take 20-30 minutes, but are worth the wait. They come with a very crispy crust that is more coating than breading, and very large meaty pieces, with drumettes almost the size of smaller regular drumsticks, so you get a lot of juicy chicken with each bite of breading. They are also expensive as wings go, about $2 each in small quantities, coming down to a dollar per in the largest orders (30). All are good, but personally I had a small preference for the meatier, juicier drumettes over the wing sections, and the soy garlic over the spicy sauce. The spicy is hot but not crazy hot, while the soy is not spicy at all but has a great, deep, dark, garlicky flavor. All wings are accompanied by cubes of pickled daikon radish, which serves as a palette cleanser, a sweet contrast to the chicken, and is also believed to be a digestion enhancer.\nThe wings are the main attraction and signature, but there is plenty of other good stuff to try. The takoyaki are a must if only because you so rarely get the chance to have octopus at casual chain restaurants. Described as fried octopus dumplings, they are dough fritters with a chunk of octopus in the middle, round, golf ball-sized, of very light airy dough, topped with a drizzle of Japanese okonomiyaki sauce, a thick, rich brown sauce used on cabbage pancakes in Japan. They are finished with dried fish flakes, and as something you don't see every day, are well worth trying. Other standouts are the much more common Korean main course of bimimbap, a bowl of white rice and assorted seasonal vegetables topped with an egg and choice of chicken, seafood, tofu or bulgogi, very thinly sliced and marinated ribeye of beef. Bimimbap is served in a deep sizzling bowl so it keeps on cooking, and the rice gets uniquely crispy and crunchy as you eat, sort of two meals in one.\nThe bulgogi is also available as a main course, but is most interesting in the delicious sliders, a trio of small burger rolls that form the meat into patties, topped with thin slices of cucumber, pickled red onion and coleslaw, a really tasty and textural combination that in some ways is reminiscent of South Carolina pulled pork with crunchy slaw, except with Asian flavored beef. Another offbeat specialty is rice cakes, which are little cylindrical logs of chewy rice dough. Sort of a Korean take on gnocchi, these come in a couple of entrée dishes, including one with mixed seafood and one with chunks of chicken, cheese and scallions, both in sweat-inducing hot sauce and among the spiciest dishes on the menu.\nAt the end of the day, Bonchon is two restaurants in one, a specialty wing place and a much broader Korean eatery, all in a fast casual disguise. For a streamlined chain place, it does a very good job at both, though with prices more akin to a traditional full service restaurant.\nPilgrimage-worthy?: For fried chicken/wing lovers who have yet to try Korean style.\nRating: Yum! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\nPrice: $$-$$$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\nDetails: Nearly 40 locations in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C. and California; us.bonchon.com\nMORE: Read previous columns\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.
