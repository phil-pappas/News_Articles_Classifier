However, over the past few weeks there has been some movement towards more lenient regulations as imposed by anti-cartel authorities, mainly in Europe, commented report author Jill Barthel, analyst, HVS London.\nThe HVS report concludes that hotels should aim for a healthy balance between OTA bookings and bookings from their own website, making sure they maximize their website bookings by making their site as up-to-date, attractive and easy-to-use as possible.\nIt might come down to the small details that make guests decide which channel to book through, added report co-author HVS director Sophie Perret. Search engine optimization is worth exploring and while not cost-free, is comparatively cheaper than the cost of rooms sold via OTAs.\nWhile limiting your exposure to OTAs as much as possible might reduce your distribution cost, this could be at the expense of overall occupancy and ultimately ancillary revenues generated through restaurants and bars.\nSource:-OTA\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Most efficient mobile travel apps in US – rankings revealed ZDirect Solutions Stirring Excitement eRevMax offers hoteliers access to advanced rate recommendations within the LIVE platform", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:04:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
