Administrator Michele Leonhart was forced to step down in May following revelations about “sex parties” involving prostitutes overseas and other misconduct among agents.\nThe DEA, created by the Nixon administration in 1973 during the war on drugs, enforces the country’s drug laws and bring violators to justice. A basic way agents do their jobs is by recruiting informants. The agency is supposed to monitor when they cross the line into illegal activity and keep tight tabs on them, according to guidelines set by the attorney general.\nInteresting read: The intellectual architect of the US’ modern war on drugs has died\nBut investigators found that the agency hasn’t always followed those guidelines, instead setting up its own standards. So drug kingpins, as well as lawyers, doctors or journalists haven’t been vetted as they should be, even though they’re considered high-risk informants.\nDespite what the policies say, the DEA’s review of potential informants’ files has long been a quick rubber stamp, investigators found. In a video released with the report, Horowitz said his investigators uncovered evidence that he said “raises significant concerns for one of the DEA’s more significant and sensitive programs.”\nA committee charged with reviewing informants weighed each source for an average of a minute each from 2003 to 2012, Horowitz said. “And that’s when there was any review at all.”\nJustice Department spokesman Patrick Rodenbush said Justice officials ordered a comprehensive review of the DEA’s confidential source policies late last year.\n“The review will address and revise policies related to high-level, privileged and media-related confidential sources and put in place more stringent requirements to better assess and mitigate risk when approving” illegal activity, Rodenbush said in a statement.\nThe agency also has a put moratorium on seeking workers’ compensation for confidential sources and is reviewing its policies and procedures for handling current recipients, he said.\nHorowitz said said the report was delayed “for months at a time” because the DEA held back information from investigators. Even after a year of investigating, the inspector general’s office calls its review of the informant program “limited.”\nDespite a lack of documentation, claims submitted to the Labor Department by DEA officials seeking compensation for injuries or death of informants were routinely approved, investigators found. For example:\nA confidential source was presumably killed overseas in 1991, and the DEA got benefits for the source’s family. But according to the file, there were no witnesses to the informant’s death and the body had not been recovered. A source who was shot and injured at home in 2002 received benefits, even though the informant’s file indicates that there were no witnesses to the shooting and contains no evidence of a link between the shooting and the person’s status as a DEA source. The U.S. Labor Department apparently considered the applications for workers’ compensation to be accurate. Some “disabled” confidential sources drew paychecks from both the DEA and the Labor Department for years.\n© 2015 , The Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh65j9UAQJ4?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-28T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:57:41.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
