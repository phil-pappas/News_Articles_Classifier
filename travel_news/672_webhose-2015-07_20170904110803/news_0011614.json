It joins San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, among cities authorizing the transactions.\nPhiladelphia also changed zoning rules to allow rentals in residential areas and is subjecting them to an 8 1/2 per cent hotel tax. The rentals had been operating tax free.\nCity Councilman William Greenlee says Airbnb-type rentals are essentially short-term hotels and should be made to follow the same rules.\nA permit is required for rentals lasting more than 30 days. The city says homes can't be rented out for more than 180 days per year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:13:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
