The eyes move naturally and gradually up the frame moving from one element to the next. The image is very nicely illuminated and has excellent colours and clarity. (26635) 2015-07-06 3:47 \nHi Ourania This is a varied architectural landscape with lots and lots of colour and detail to interest the eye. The Erectheon has always been one of my favourite buildings, I even have a black and white drawing of it in my house! You have a very pleasant exposure and light in this fine photo. Thanks as always, wishing you the best of everything from Ireland.
