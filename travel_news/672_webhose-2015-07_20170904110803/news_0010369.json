Talks aimed at averting industrial action broke down on Monday, opening the door for a 24-hour strike by 20,000 London Underground workers beginning on Wednesday evening. Further last-ditch negotiations could still avert the walk-out – there were talks until late last night and further meetings scheduled for today. A 48-hour strike by First Great Western staff is also expected to cause disruption from Wednesday evening until Saturday morning. The train company runs routes from London Paddington, and in South Wales, the Cotswolds and the West of England. To check if your train is affected, see the First Great Western website. Why are workers striking? It’s all about a pay increase ahead of the launch of the 24-hour Night Tube in September. London Underground’s final offer, including a two per cent rise and a £2,000 bonus for drivers working on the all-night service, was rejected by representatives from four unions – RMT, Aslef, the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) and Unite. First Great Western staff are striking over plans to cut guards and buffet cars on the company’s new Hitachi Inter City Express trains. Bus services will still be running Photo: GETTY When will it start? RMT, United and TSSA members are planning a 24-hour Tube strike from 18:30 on Wednesday evening (July 8); ASLEF members from 21:30. First Great Western staff will begin their 48-hour strike at 18:30 on Wednesday. How bad will disruption be? If the Tube strike goes ahead, it will be very bad. Transport for London (TfL) warns that there will be no service whatsoever from “late afternoon” on July 8 and no service at all on July 9. This includes the London Overground and DLR – a total of 11 lines and 270 stations. For live updates check the TfL website . First Great Western services “will be significantly affected from Thursday, July 9 to the start of service on Saturday, July 11, with minor alterations to some services on Wednesday, July 8 from 18.00”, the company said. It warns that capacity will be reduced and that trains will be extremely busy. Passengers – particularly those planning to travel to Cardiff for The Ashes on Thursday or Friday – are advised to make alternative travel arrangements if possible. How will I get around?
