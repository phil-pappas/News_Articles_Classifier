By DAVID KOENIG AP Airlines Writer \nDALLAS — A United Airlines captain threw bullets in a trash bin accessible to passengers and later flushed them down a toilet on board a flight that he was piloting to Germany. \nA United spokeswoman said Thursday that the pilot should not have thrown the bullets in the toilet. She said the pilot hasn’t been fired but that the incident is still under investigation. \nAirline spokeswoman Karen May said the pilot is allowed to carry a gun on domestic flights under a post-9/11 federal program intended to make planes harder to hijack. She said the pilot dumped the bullets in a waste bin then in a toilet after realizing he had them in his bag on a June 23 flight from Houston to Munich. Germany has strict gun laws. \n“He did incorrectly dispose of the ammunition,” May said, “but it is likely that the pilot is not going to face any criminal charges.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:07:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
