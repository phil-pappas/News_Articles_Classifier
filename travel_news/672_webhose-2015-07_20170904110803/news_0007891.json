Other Keynote speakers also unveiled today include, Rob Forkan co-founder of international brand Gandys and Tanya Mann Rennick, creator of the STARR Principle. They’ll be joining over 4,000 visitors and 175 leading business to business suppliers at the UK’s award-winning annual event for PAs, EAs and office managers. \nLa Grange served President Mandela for 19 years in different capacities until his death on 5 December 2013. She will be sharing exclusive insights from her long and inspirational career working with ‘the greatest statesman of our time,’ starting out at the Department of State Expenditure in 1992, through to becoming one of the three appointed private secretaries in President Mandela’s personal staff by 1997. Whilst the PA role may have evolved since La Grange first started out as a typist for Mary Mxadana, President Mandela’s private secretary in 1994, La Grange’s keen to impart her knowledge and experiences to others just starting out in their career. Speaking ahead of her office* keynote, she says that within the industry it’s vital to “never allow yourself to be blinded by a title or a salary” and that “anything can be achieved through commitment, loyalty and dedication.” It’s hard won advice that has certainly built her a long and successful career. Zelda La Grange’s office* Keynote, ‘It starts with you’ will take place at 1pm on Tuesday 13th October at Olympia, London – coinciding with National PA day.
