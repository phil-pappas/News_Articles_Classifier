To this end they are much lighter than traditional models, to ensure either carrying your skis or using them with skins is less demanding. Hike & ride touring Best on test Scott Superguide 95 £500 Best for: Taking everything in their stride Low speed, smoothness, versatility and groomed piste are the areas in which the Superguide 95s record category-topping scores. Great all rounders, they perform convincingly on piste and off. They supply easy turn initiations and feel solid through the transitions. Off piste, they're stable and poppy, and on hard snow they provide superb edge hold. Happy going fast or slow, they're comfortable with everything that comes their way. Tech talk Sidewall construction containing a wood core strengthened with carbon and Kevlar. They have a distinctive sidecut: straighter underfoot for stability and curvier at the front and back for easy turning. The topsheet has a convex profile, higher in the middle and curving downwards towards the edges, to increase torsional stiffness (resistance to twisting). + Low speed, smoothness, versatility, groomed piste – None Lengths: 178, 184 Sidecut: 128/95/116 (178) Radius: 21m/28m/15m (178) Best value Atomic Backland 85 £425 Best for: Control and grip in variable conditions The Backland 85s are judged best of this group for liveliness/responsiveness, also scoring strongly for short turns, low speed, smoothness and off piste. Good all rounders, they give confidence both on and off piste, with a great feeling of control and grip. They're versatile and at home in most conditions. Considering their light weight, they deal very well with speed and aggressive skiing. Tech talk Cap construction with partial sidewalls underfoot. Ultra light poplar/karuba wood core reinforced with carbon. Rockered 15 per cent at the tips. + Short turns, low speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste – None Lengths: 158, 164, 170, 176, 182 Sidecut: 121/85/111 (176) Radius: 18m (176) • Ski test winners: On-piste skis • Ski test winners: All-mountain skis • Ski test winners: Freeride skis • Ski test winners: Big mountain skis • Ski test winners: Park & pipe skis Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:35:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
