I think he just got a knock to the head by Jakey Lever so he’ll be fine,” Walker said. “He finished the whole session.”\nWalker, with 37 goals so far this season, said he was keen to return to the form that delivered him 6.5 in the season-opener against North Melbourne.

The Swans dual Brownlow Medallist has taken leave this week following ongoing jeering whenever he goes near the ball, and it is unclear whether he will play the twilight game against the Crows.\n“Well, hopefully he doesn’t get too many kicks,” Walker said.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/29/1227461/664408-ce6e89b8-35a0-11e5-8996-1850b37d48c6.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-29T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:36:26.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
