These designations focused on such positive characteristics as the city’s ban of drive-through restaurants and public smoking, its pedestrian and bicycle-friendly roads, its year-round gorgeous weather, and easy access to sprawling coastline and the ancient volcanic chain of “Seven Sisters” peaks. \nAstonishingly, the prevalence of fine, local wine — primarily Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, as well as a growing trend of coastal aromatic white varietals — was somehow not a deciding factor. \nNevertheless, the award-winning vintages coming out of San Luis Obispo’s little-known and underappreciated Edna Valley, Arroyo Grande Valley and Avila Beach coastal wine growing areas (on average, just five miles from the waves) are sure to inspire smiles, especially during summer vacations to the USA’s happiest town. \nFollow this city-to-sea trail to discover some of the region’s most sublimely refreshing white wines while enjoying the sea breezes and sunshine of California’s coolest wine growing region (literally — it has an average daily maximum temperature of 70 degrees). \nCity attractions \nFor a quick glimpse of “SLO” community and culture, start at the heart of downtown on a Thursday evening. On this day each week, the main street transforms into a sunset street fair where thousands of locals and visitors peruse the fresh farmers’ produce, local grub and live entertainment. \nTo escape the fray, turn just off the main drag for a stay at Granada Hotel Bistro , where a recent multi-million-dollar renovation of the historic edifice offers visitors an upscale, second-story perch from which to observe the bustling town below. Exposed brick walls and original hardwood floors contrast with modern accents, original art and the finest amenities in the 17 snug suites. The property also features a popular Art Bar studio and a restaurant with a carefully curated international wine list to start off the wine country adventure. \nFrom downtown, it’s a quick, convenient five-mile drive to wine country. One of the first wine tasting rooms of SLO’s Edna Valley AVA is Saucelito Canyon . Its approachable, barrel-table patio and tasting room is understated compared to its neighbor, Edna Valley Winery , but the wine and warm, family hospitality speak volumes. The winery has some of the deepest roots in the relatively young SLO wine region, having been built upon Zinfandel vines planted in the upper Arroyo Grande Valley in 1880. Rescued from a forest of overhanging poison oak and revived to its original vigor by the Greenough family in the ’70s, Saucelito Canyon vines produce some of the region’s best, most complex Zins, as well as the warm-weather favorite, Sauvignon Blanc. Second-generation winemaker Tom Greenough has also begun expanding the winery’s horizons with new Rhône varietals like Grenache Blanc. \nIn an industry where Rhône varieties are the rising stars, and in a wine country where Chardonnay is king (the region just hosted the first International Chardonnay Symposium in June), Claiborne Churchill winery stands out with its longtime dedication to the much lesser-known Alsatians. Riesling and Gewürztraminer are two of the most notable varietals of the now-French, once-German province of Alsace (just across the Rhine from Germany). When former University of Michigan professors Claiborne (Clay) Thompson and Fredericka Churchill Thompson decided in 1981 to leave their careers to start a winery in California, they took inspiration from that region’s famously “fruity, yet dry” wines. The varietal detour is memorable and worth experiencing at this sustainable, straw-bale constructed winery where their dry, elegant, aromatic white wines are refreshing in more ways than one. \nFrom the adorably country-chic, historic “townsite” of the Old Edna Barn, where Sextant Winery pours its vintages, it can be difficult to grasp the relevance of the marine allusion in its name (a sextant is an Old World instrument used to navigate across open water). A nod to the owners’ passion for sailing, the moniker is also an apt reminder of the important influence of the cool, coastal fog that creeps over Edna Valley and Sextant’s MacGregor Vineyard each day from the Pacific shores that are just a few miles away. Sextant’s award-winning Edna Valley Chard offers a crisp tartness and acidity as cooling as the ocean breeze that rustles through this whimsical property. Here, baby doll sheep and blue belly lizards find a home among a collection of reimagined farmhouse cottages (available for vacation rental) and a gourmet deli. Good luck eluding SLO’s happy charms at Old Edna . \nSea adventures \nFrom the coastal influence seen in the Edna and Arroyo Grande Valleys, move on to the coastal views in Avila Beach, via the Highway 101 or, if you prefer, the scenic Bob Jones City-to-Sea Trail, a half-way completed bicycle and multi-use path that will soon connect downtown SLO with the gentle waves of Avila Beach’s protected shores. \nOn the way, Kelsey See Canyon Vineyards is a must-stop shop on the happiest wine trail. Tucked back on the winding See Canyon Road, an area known best for its apple orchards, Kelsey’s quaint winery offers a laidback outdoor seating area where the property’s more than 100 roaming peacocks compete for public attention with guests’ lounging dogs and live music on the weekends. Owner Dick Kelsey, who started out in the harbor tugboat business, is keen to share his stories of how his “little retirement project” turned into a blossoming wine business, and how a pair of neighboring peacocks evolved into a booming colony and the winery’s popular mascots. Cool down in the shaded grassy picnic area with the estate Chardonnay or the deliciously dry and unique apple cider wine blends to hear the tales. \nThe final, smile-guaranteed stop on the city-to-sea trail is Avila Beach proper, the beachy hamlet where visitors regularly enjoy spectacular views of breaching whales, sea lions and seals, and where a growing number of tasting rooms are also popping up. \nSinor-LaVallee Winery , across from the Central Coast Aquarium in Avila, is one of the newest among them, and is surely one of the best finds in the region. Winemaker Mike Sinor, whose accolades include numerous high-scoring wines and the 2012 Winemaker of the Year title for San Luis Obispo County, worked in the local wine industry for decades before purchasing his ocean-view Bassi Vineyard in 2013. Since taking over operations, he has instituted vermicomposting and other sustainable methods that have earned his budding brand big awards and a quick rise in popularity. On a hot summer day, knock the sand off your feet and head into his tasting room to sample the beautiful, balanced estate Chardonnay, Pinot Gris and Albariño while you soak up the scenic seaside views. \nFor those who opt for the aforementioned bike ride on the Bob Jones Trail, Peloton Cellars is the only natural conclusion to this city-to-sea wine tour. The cycling-themed winery, featuring a homemade penny-farthing hung over the tasting bar, was inspired by seasoned wine grape grower, consultant and winemaker Bill Kesselring’s two passions: wine and competitive bicycle racing. And there is no happier pairing. After a long ride on SLO’s coastal hillsides, sip his crisp Albariño made from Edna and Arroyo Grande Valley grapes, while watching the sun melt into the placid waters of the Pacific Ocean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:47:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
