We have a full diary, the buyers are top quality and it is clearly a market leading event,” comments Rowan Lingard, Senior Business Development Manager at the Barbican.” The Barbican has launched a new day delegate package for the Conservatory and Garden Room at The Meetings Show today. \nThe Conservatory itself is being re-launched on stand G22 during the three days of the show and this package offers delegates an opportunity to organise a meeting or conference in a unique venue in the heart of the City of London. The new package includes catering in the Conservatory and AV management in the Garden Room for a capacity of up to 150 delegates. The Conservatory, is a hidden tropical oasis and home to exotic fish and 2,000 species of plants and trees as well as being a unique event space. “We have hosted many fantastic events in the Conservatory and Garden Room but this package is designed to offer real value for those planning meetings and conferences,” concludes Lingard. The Barbican will be on stand G22 on all three days of The Meetings Show re-launching the Conservatory - the second largest glass house in London, and one of the Barbican’s most popular event spaces.
