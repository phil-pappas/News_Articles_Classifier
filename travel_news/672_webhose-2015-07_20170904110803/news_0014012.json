Instead of dramatic views of the Harumi Tateyama range rising 3000m straight out of Toyama Bay, there is dense cloud.\nJacket collars are pulled tight against a nippy wind bearing a snow flurry. Although it’s early spring, the morning temperatures are cold.\nOur delightful guide smiles. “You can see the view 351 days a year. Please come back,” he says.\nWe do see the mountains later and, while we are not standing in the perfect viewing position, we get the magnificent picture.\nMeanwhile, I look out to sea and imagine the fish there, the fish that are unique to this vast inlet on Japan’s northern coast – such as Japanese amberjack, white shrimp, firefly squid and red snow crab. At night the squid glow fluorescent blue along the shoreline. Shogawakyo Tourist Ship Omaki hot spring. Picture: Alamy Source: Alamy\nThe best way to sample a selection of local seafood is in a Toyama sushi set.\nFor about $25 the sushi is made in front of diners and served in order of strength of flavour. The most delicate, such as the amberjack, come first and the most exciting and intense, like crab brain, last.\nThe perfect accompaniment is the dry, elegant local sake made of rice and the pure water of melting snow that fills seven major rivers that flow into Toyama Bay.\nThere are more than 20 sake breweries in the area. Toyama is also well known for its black ramen. The noodle dish has a slightly smoky-tasting soy base and comes topped with egg and pork.\nIt turns out Toyama is home to the most “beautiful Starbucks”, which is most remarkable for its lovely setting on the side of the Jinzu River, its couches full of canoodling couples. There’s a long queue.\nFrom the seaside station at Amaharashi we hop on a light-rail carriage decorated with pictures of Doraemon – a popular anime robot cat character – and ride a few kilometres to Takaoka, where the happy blue cartoon character’s creator, Fujiko Fujio, was born. Toyama Prefecture, Japan. Picture: Toyama Prefectural Government Source: Supplied\nTakaoka is also home to the 440-year-old Takaoka Kojo gardens, 12ha of cherry blossoms, rhododendrons and camellias interspersed with 100 bronze statues and one of the most important Shinto shrines in the area, Imizu-jinja.\nLess than 10 minutes walk from Takaoka station is the third tallest Buddha in Japan. The almost 16m-high bronze was constructed in 1933 using moulds made in slices.\nHerbal medicine has a long history in the region and the Ikedaya Yasubei Shoten has been around for more than 300 years. Downstairs in the apothecary are concoctions for stiff necks, hangovers, things to “smooth the blood in people who feel the cold”, and to treat arthritis and incontinence among many other ailments.\nUpstairs at Yakuto restaurant, we try the “eating for health” menu with dishes like mountain medicine and ancient rice. Each course is a perfect little dish wrapped in a banana leaf or giant kelp, to open like a precious gift.\nAn extension to the Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train line from Nagano to Kanazawa means Toyama, on the northern side of the country’s main island of Honshu, is now just two hours from Toyko, or half the time it used to take to travel there. Gassho-zukuri village, Gokayama.

Many of them are still lived in and others are shops with some of the best craft, souvenir and gift shopping in Japan.\nTakayama produces a great deal of sake which wins prizes as the best in Japan. There are several sake breweries in the old-town precinct.\nThe breweries are distinguishable by the large cedar balls hanging above their doorways. If the ball is fresh and green, sake is being brewed. The cedar ball browns as the brewing finishes. It’s an invitation to come in and try, so we step into the award-winning Funasaka Brewery (105 Kamisanno-Machi).\nUnlike wine, sake does not necessarily improve with age. The newer sakes can be just as good as older ones, although newly fermented sakes have 19 per cent alcohol and become less alcoholic with age.\nOn our visit we are offered a free tasting of four kinds of sake.\nThe first one junmai-shu, is a little spicy. It tastes of raspberries, our server says. It’s smooth and cool and delicious. He’s talking as a vintner at a winery cellar door might. Toyama Prefecture.

This genshu is 19 per cent. It has a far richer flavour and a wee drop in the bottom of a shot glass seems far too small.\nA fourth is a special bottle, according to our server.\nIt’s only his second best, though, because the best has sold out. Dai-ginjoshu tastes rather nice anyway. It’s sweet and fruity.\nThe first two sakes can be consumed hot or cold. The last two should be drunk cold.\nMaking and tasting sake is a more complex and sophisticated business than at first glance.\nGO2\nJAPAN\nGETTING THERE\nJAL flies from daily Australia to Tokyo.\nThe Hokuriku Shinkansen bullet train takes two hours to travel from Toyko to Toyama.\nSEE AND DO THERE\nTakaoka Kojo Gardens\nThe 440 year old gardens have more than 100 bronze statues, 1500 cherry blossom trees, a zoo, and the Imizu-Jinja shrine. The 12 hectares once formed the grounds of castle built as a retirement home for a local feudal lord. The castle is no long longer there but the lovely garden remains.\nIkedaya Yasubsei Shoten\nWith cures for everything from a hangover to continence, this 300-year-old apothecary has demonstrations of making the natural medicines you can buy. Or try the healthy lunch upstairs for Y1250. No reservation necessary. Closed on Wednesdays. 1-3-5 Tsutsumichodori Toyama 930-0046\nGohyaku-Rakan\nIn the Kureha Hills behind Toyama are 500 stone statues representing the disciples of Buddha. They say no face has the same expression and it’s likely one of them looks just like you. A good place too for viewing cherry blossoms and autumn leaves, depending on the season. Chokeiji Temple is a few minutes walk from Minzoku Mingei Mura Bus Station.\nShimoninomachi-Ojiinmachi Traditional Buildings Preservation Area\nWander through the delightful Takayama old town to Miyagawa Morning Market to admire heritage homes preserved as they were in the Edo period. Shop for lovely ceramics, fabrics, lacquer wear and snacks as you explore the many shops and stalls.\nAinokura Heritage Village\nEat locally foraged food around the fire pit and sleep on tatami mats in a 210 year old gassho farm house. Since 1995 when it was made a World Heritage site, the 23 thatch-roof houses have remained preserved and a few of them are open to guests.\nwww.gokayama-info.jp/en", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/411133-904f17f8-1b90-11e5-9110-19d2cf6b05b4.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/411690-8c17f740-1b90-11e5-9110-19d2cf6b05b4.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/411628-927eaa7a-1b90-11e5-9110-19d2cf6b05b4.jpg", "http://www.gokayama-info.jp/en/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/02/1227425/411174-93b5a114-1b90-11e5-9110-19d2cf6b05b4.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:22:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
