She said: “A lot of people outside China do not know that Ctrip also provides hotels and flights to worldwide destinations like London, Paris and Italy.” \n\nTo boost Ctrip.com ’s brand across South-east Asia, Zhu said they will be engaging in partnerships with banks and retail malls to conduct joint promotions in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. \n\nEarlier this May, the Priceline Group upped its stake in Ctrip by injecting US$250 million in the company via a convertible bond and currently owns roughly 10.5 per cent of Ctrip’s shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:06:17.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
