Photo courtesy of DFW Airport If you survey travelers who regularly fly to and from the United States to points abroad, one of their pain points is dealing with U.S. Customs and Border Protection when arriving home. Depending on the airport and time of day, travelers can spend up to three hours waiting to enter the country.\nI personally avoid that pain thanks to my Global Entry card, but not everyone wants to go through the process and pay the $100 for a five-year membership.\nSo now airports are starting to improve the process for those who don’t belong to Global Entry by offering automated passport control kiosks.\nAnd a new report from Acuity Market Intelligence backs this up, noting that airports will spend more than $2.2 billion globally on Automated Border Control (ABC) eGates and kiosks between 2014 and 2018 in a market projected to grow at 19.5% compound annual growth rate.\n“ The Global Automated Border Control Industry Report: Airport eGates & Kiosks ,” forecasts that the total number of airport eGates with integrated biometrics that replace border agents at passport control desks will nearly triple from the current installed base of 1,117 to 3,238 by 2018. An additional 14,942 specialized ABC kiosks and boarding eGates that rely on biometrics to expedite immigration processing will also be deployed over the forecast period.\nAirports in North America will spend approximately $300 million on eGates and kiosks from 2014 to 2018. The region will also experience consistent year-on-year growth achieving a CAGR of 21% during the forecast period, with nearly 4,000 kiosks currently deployed.\nThe kiosks are simple to use and replace the declaration card usually given to passengers aboard a flight. Travelers go to a kiosk, where they scan their passports and get their photo taken. They then are prompted to answer a series of questions on a touch screen. Once passengers have completed the questions, a receipt is issued. They then bring their passport, travel information and receipt to a U.S. Customs officer for verification.

Chic ago O’Hare International Airport was the first U.S. airport to offer the passport kiosks, deploying 32 of them in August 2013 for U.S. and Canadian travelers arriving in Terminal 5. Other airports with passport kiosks include Vancouver International, Montreal-Trudeau International , Seattle-Tacoma , Dallas/Fort Worth , Orlando , Houston Intercontinental , Miami , Fort Lauderdale and JFK . And the world’s busiest airport -- Hartsfield-Jackson -- recently announced it would be installing the kiosks in its E and F international terminals.\n“Airports across the globe are struggling with a universal challenge; maintaining security vigilance while accommodating ever increasing numbers of international passengers,” said Acuity’s Maxine Most in a press release. “Airport operators and border control authorities are embracing ABC eGates and kiosks as a means to reduce congestion and immigration wait times while providing secure, fast, and user-friendly border crossings. This improves both the passenger experience and the bottom line.”", "external_links": ["http://www.acuity-mi.com/ABCair_Report.php", "http://www.broward.org/airport", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;hMf5fiz4p2M", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/q/H/DFW-arrivals-hall.jpg", "http://www.admtl.com/passengers/home.aspx", "http://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry", "http://www.panynj.gov/airports/jfk.html", "http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/en/home/pages/default.aspx", "http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/q/H/DFW-arrivals-hall.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:04:57.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
