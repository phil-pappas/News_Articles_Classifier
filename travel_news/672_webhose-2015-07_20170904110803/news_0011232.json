The vans are used to observe, record and prosecute motorists who do not obey road signs and place themselves, other road users and railway users in danger.\nIn March 2015, local people raised concerns after a train passed through Wem level crossing when the barriers were in the up position. Network Rail wants to make people aware that the crossing was being used safely.\nThe barriers are designed to remain raised if something is detected beneath them, and the equipment is designed to stop the normal movement of trains if any object is detected on the crossing. In this situation, the driver of each train is automatically stopped before getting to the crossing.\nTrain drivers are then allowed to continue very slowly at caution with the specific instruction to only proceed over the crossing if it is clear to do so, the red flashing lights are operating and road traffic is not moving. This is in line with standard industry processes for safe operation.\nMembers of the public with any queries should call the Network Rail 24-Hour National Helpline on 03457 11 41 41.\nSource:- Network Rail\nRelated Posts Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Network Rail completes £200m festive upgrade programme Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Dangerous behaviour at level crossings caught on dash cam", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:05:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
