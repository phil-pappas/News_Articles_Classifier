This year’s awards attracted 269 entries from 83 organizations and individuals worldwide, the highest numbers since 2007. Judged by panels of experts, the PATA Awards recognize exceptional achievement in six categories: Marketing, Environment, Heritage and Culture, Education and Training, Marketing Media and Travel Journalism with Grand Awards given for four. The award ceremony will take place at the PATA Travel Mart this September, in Bangalore. \nJetwing Yala was launched in January 2014, and has quickly established itself as the premier resort in the Deep South of Sri Lanka. Featuring 80 rooms and 10 luxury tented villas, Jetwing Yala brings world class luxury and hospitality to the wilderness of Yala, in a stunning location overlooking massive sand dunes and the vibrant hues of the Indian Ocean. The entire property was designed from ground up to be as sustainable as possible, with an acre dedicated to a solar park containing over 1,000 panels, generating 40% of the hotel’s electricity demand, a biomass boiler which utilizes cinnamon wood to power a vapor absorption chiller (which in turn powers air conditioning) and a composting machine that reduces processing from the standard 40 days to 14-20 days. \nFunctioning as the Jetwing brand’s regular communication with its public, The Front Desk provides a constant and consistent look at the company’s progress, instilling a sense of familiarity and belonging among visitors in a personal form of digital communication. The title symbolizes the functions of the reception at a hotel, be it a warm welcome, acting as an information provider, and a source of communication between hotel and guest. In addition, the layout was constructed around the concept of guest relations, to provide information, generate interest, and to foster communication between Jetwing and international visitors in a professional and attractive design. \n“This is a victory for Sri Lanka, and not just Jetwing” said Hiran Cooray, Chairman of Jetwing. “If you look at all the other winners, the majority belong to the tourism authorities of countries – Hong Kong, Australia, Taiwan and Korea for example. To be recognized and winning both a Grand and a Gold Award speaks volumes about our efforts, and proves that we as a country and a company are on the right path,” he continued. \nAbout PATA \nFounded in 1951, the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) is a not-for profit association that is internationally acclaimed for acting as a catalyst for the responsible development of travel and tourism to, from and within the Asia Pacific region.
