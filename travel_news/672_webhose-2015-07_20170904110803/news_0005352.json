They can have up to 8 ounces in their homes and grow up to four plants out of public view. Oregon residents also can carry up to an ounce outside their homes, although it's illegal to smoke it in public.\nBut they can't transport it out of state.\nAnd the new airport rule doesn't mean it'll be smooth sailing through the security checkpoints operated by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.\nFederal law governs the TSA's screening procedures, and marijuana remains illegal in the eyes of the federal government. But the agency's primary mission is to \"detect threats to aviation security,\" according to the agency.\nThough TSA officers don't look for illegal drugs, they will call law enforcement if they find drugs or any other items that might violate the law.\nThat's why the Portland airport's TSA officers will notify Port Police if they find any marijuana on travelers. If you aren't underage, have the legal limit and are flying within the state, the police will let you go.\nConsider leaving for the airport even a little bit earlier if you're planning to transport that legal ounce of pot on your in-state flight. And don't drive to the airport while stoned. That's still illegal.", "external_links": ["http://www.kptv.com/story/29506836/portland-international-airport-changes-recreational-pot-policy#ixzz3fTyrvRf2"], "published": "2015-07-13T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T05:58:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
