In fact I don’t think there’s anything else that’s legal that comes close. It’s probably because I have a short attention span and an addiction to new places.\nWith the road trip, once you’ve ‘done’ a place, you simply move on.\nAs a kid I was almost permanently on road trips.\nMy family used to drive from Beirut to London and back once a year and if you add a couple of annual expeditions into the Syrian desert, I was very used to being squeezed into the back of an early Range Rover with a couple of Rhodesian Ridgebacks and enough supplies to relieve Mafeking.\nA high old time: Dom with his wife Stacey, daughter Parker and son Jackson get up close to Gaudi architecture in Barcelona\nThis obsession has been handed down to me, and every Easter the Joly family get in a car, drive out of our Cotswold farm and head off on a big adventure.\nLast year we drove to Istanbul and back, which went surprisingly well except for being shot at by a Serbian policeman and having to make a break for the nearby Bulgarian border to escape him (we did so by about 20 seconds and crossed over into Bulgaria as he roared up to the frontier post).\nThis year I wanted to drive all the way down to the Sahara through Morocco, but there was some resistance from my American/Canadian wife, who has become overly wary of travelling to some places.\nI desperately tried to plead Morocco’s case, but a news item about some arrests involving a Casablancan Islamic State franchise sealed the deal.\n Next All aboard for the Fjords! The Nordland Railway offers a... Stunning drone images of hidden islands and turquoise waters... The most crowded island on Earth: Tiny Caribbean islet... All hail the American Queen! Step on the steamboat which... So we settled on a tour of the Iberian Peninsula. I have to admit to being a bit disappointed. A drive round Spain and Portugal just didn’t have the ‘frisson’ of Istanbul or bust.\nWe got to Spain in some style. We hopped on a Brittany Ferries ship in Plymouth and spent the 20 or so hours that it took to get to Santander in the luxurious comfort of a Commodore cabin complete with balcony and ample room in which to swing a cat.\nNot wishing to spend any longer than necessary in Santander, we headed straight for Barcelona. We arrived in a wet and cloudy Catalan capital, a place best enjoyed in full sun.\nWe tramped through the alleys, ate staggeringly good food, drank our bodyweight in sangria and saw everything that Gaudi had ever built.\nWhen we left, three days later, we were exhausted and determined to take it easy in our next destination – Valencia.\nSpectacle: A procession of worshippers in their distinctive outfits leave a church during Holy Week (left) and inside the glorious Alhambra palace (right)\nI knew very little about Spain’s third-largest city. It is relatively untroubled by mass tourism. We loved the place straight away.\nOur favourite things were the beautiful market (Mercado Central), crammed to the hilt with wonderful things to eat and curious dead sea creatures to repulse the kids.\nWe also spent a blissful afternoon cycling through the splendidly long, narrow park (Jardi Del Turia) which used to be the course of the river Turia that flowed through the centre of the city until it was redirected in 1957 following a catastrophic flood.\nIn the evening we made a pilgrimage to La Pepica, one of the great Spanish paella restaurants reassuringly plastered with the usual photos of David Niven and Ernest Hemingway, the ancient method of restaurant approval before TripAdvisor and their anodyne ilk arrived en masse.\nNext up was Andalucia, the Moorish jewel in the Spanish crown. We drove to Granada through the stunning Sierra Nevada mountain range.\nJust passing through: Dom poses beneath the sign for Poo village\nThe views were so staggering that I swear I spotted the kids (14 and ten) look up from their electronic devices more than once… but it might have been my imagination.\nGranada is all about the imperious Alhambra, the mighty palace complex that overlooks the old whitewashed city in the valley below.\nMake sure you book your tickets in advance, as the queuing system is something straight out of the Spanish Inquisition.\nWe toured the Alhambra and it was mightily impressive, but the real show was going on down in town.\nIt was the first day of Semana Santa (Holy Week) and every night for seven days, the whole of Spain gets involved.\nEndless parades of religious floats and processions of musicians and ‘atoning sinners’ dressed in very Ku Klux Klan-type pointy hats and hoods made for increasingly surreal scenes.\nIt was wonderful and we didn’t get much sleep, but nobody minded whatsoever.\nWe crawled gingerly out of Granada bound for Seville. From the moment we drove into the city, we realised this was going to be our favourite destination of the trip.\nThe city smelled of orange blossom, everywhere you looked was more beautiful architecture, the food was exquisite and we started talking about moving there permanently.\nThe only problem was the tourists. Not us, obviously, we were travellers…\nWe checked into a large hotel just outside the city. It had a sizeable pool and lush green gardens. Seville gets quite stupidly hot, so we used this oasis as a base from which to launch several raids into the city.\nWe were there for El Silencio the night before Good Friday when the pointy-heads and the floats all marched through the city to the beat of a solitary drum and occasional ethereal chant.\nIt was heart-stoppingly beautiful and affected us all deeply in a way religion rarely does.\nThen it was off to the Spanish capital, Madrid. We checked into Villa Real, a hotel slap-bang in the centre with a friendly doorman more than happy to play keepy-uppy with my boy while we braved the Prado museum.\nThe football theme continued as I remortgaged the house to buy us four tickets to see Real Madrid play Granada at the Bernabeu.\nOld cathedral spires can be seen in Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Santiago de Compostela\nIt was our first football match ever and we chose a corker – Real Madrid won 9-1, with five being scored by Ronaldo.\nMadrid grew on us, especially our daily breakfast at the Mercado San Miguel. Beer and oysters for me, bocadillos and fresh orange juice for the family – ay caramba.\nWe were now off towards Portugal but we stopped for a night in Salamanca, the ancient university town that has the finest skyline in Spain.\nArriving in Portugal, we spent three days in Lisbon. It’s one of Europe’s most underrated cities, quirky and kooky and a delight to explore.\nMy favourite find was the Casa do Alentejo – an anonymous entrance led us into a beautiful Moorish mansion at the top of which was a ramshackle restaurant.\nThe place served perfect Portuguese peasant food and was the culinary highlight of our trip.\nHaving quickly checked out Sintra, the curious Portuguese Portmeirion, we roared northwards to the less visited second city of Porto.\nWe were staying at an extraordinary hotel called The Yeatman, which had a phenomenal view over the river and the city beyond.\nThe hotel was so luxurious it was tricky for us to leave, but we managed to drag ourselves away to amble around this most relaxed of destinations.\nThe breathtaking view from Puerto de Panderruedas over Valdeon, in the Picos de Europa National Park, Spain\nWe ate on the wharf by the river and sampled some white port, something I became troublingly attached to.\nNow into our third week, we were a little weary of tourism and longed for spiritual relief (not really), so our penultimate destination of Santiago de Compostela was perfect.\nTechnically you should do the ‘Camino’ and arrive on foot to pay homage to the bones of St James in the cathedral, but we risked opprobrium by getting the monk in charge of car parking at our monastery/hotel to valet our Range Rover and suggest a good place to eat.\nLike all monks, he loved his grub and came up trumps. We ate at Casa Marcelo, a wonderful Asian/Galician fusion restaurant where I had the best steak tartare of my life.\nOur final destination before the ferry back was the village of Llanes, supposedly Spain’s prettiest village.\nIt might be better in the summer but it lacked a bit of atmosphere off-season. We did, however, find a lovely beach nearby (easy to find, just head for the village of Poo).\nThe kids braved a quick swim before we drove up into the Picos de Europa, a splendid little mountain range that takes you from the rugged seaside up into the Asturian Alps in half an hour.\nIf we had more time we’d have gone round the peninsula again… but the lure of the Commodore cabin and the constraints of real life were calling.\nWe were off back home again after 3,000 miles and 21 days of utter heaven. Viva Espana… y Portugal…\nTRAVEL FACTS: Brittany Ferries ( brittanyferries.co.uk , 0871 244 1400) offers crossings from Plymouth to Santander.\nReturn fares for two adults and a car with cabin start from £488 on Brittany Ferries économie (no frills).\nOn its cruise-ferry service prices start at £588.\nDouble rooms at Villa Real in Madrid costs from £90 per night.\nTo book, visit keytel.co.uk or call 0800 160 1013.\nA double room at The Yeatman in May-October costs from about £204 per night.\nVisit the-yeatman-hotel.com .\nRead more: Cross Channel Ferries to France & Spain - Brittany Ferries Keytel International - Official UK representative for the Spanish Paradors & Keytel S.A. including Prestige Hotels of the World, and Preferred Partner of the Portuguese Pousadas and Châteaux & Hôtels Collection . thttp", "external_links": ["http://the-yeatman-hotel.com/en/", "http://keytel.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1GP834d", "http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-26T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:32:41.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
