This comes on the heels of a recent announcement by Qatar Airways of additional flights to Cape Town as of 1 October 2015.\nIn addition, Edelweiss, Switzerland’s leading leisure carrier, will connect Cape Town with Zurich non-stop twice a week, operating flights from 26 October 2015 until 25 March 2016. This will be the fifth year running that Edelweiss increases its seasonal capacity to Cape Town.\nDr. Andre Schulz, Lufthansa’s new General Manager for South Africa said: “The demand for Cape Town as a top leisure destination is the reason for adding two additional flights during South Africa’s summer season, effectively increasing the seat offer by almost 20%.”\nMoreover, Lufthansa is upgrading its service on the Johannesburg – Frankfurt route, operating the Boeing 747-8 – the next generation of the iconic Jumbo Jet.\nCEO of Cape Town Tourism, Enver Duminy, adds: “This is good news for the Mother City. Whilst Qatar Airways is facilitating an important emerging market for Cape Town, Lufthansa and Edelweiss continue to enable travel to Cape Town by some of the city’s top source markets; and with the addition of flights to the country by Lufthansa’s Boeing 747-8, we expect a lot more visitors to our shores this season.”\nRelated Posts Lufthansa takes delivery of world’s first aircraft with vortex generators Austrian Airlines announced hourly flight service between Vienna and Frankfurt Fly to two European holiday islands with Lufthansa Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:43:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
