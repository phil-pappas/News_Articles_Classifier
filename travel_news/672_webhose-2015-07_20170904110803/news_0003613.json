There is fun unlimited! Dressed in traditional Dirndl dresses and Lederhoses, the lovely people of Germany enjoy their famous spring festival in traditional style and in total enjoyment. I am talking about the Stuttgart Spring Festival, Europe’s largest spring festival. Traditionally, when we think of beer festivals in Germany, Oktoberfest comes to mind as it pretty popular all over the world and is definitely one of the largest festivals of Europe. But, if you are looking for a festive atmosphere in the Spring time, the Stuttgart Spring festival has to be right on the top. If you are thinking big beer tents and massive mugs of fresh German beer served by people dressed in traditional clothing and along with other local German dishes, you are on the right track. The refreshing beer flows non stop during this festival. And if it is a bright and warm summer day, you are bound to enjoy the Spring festival even more. With lots of beer, music, a communal setting, fun rides and traditional shopping avenues, this is the place to be in Spring. Taking place between April and May and located in the Cannstatter Wasen area of Stuttgart, the Stuttgarter Fruhlingfest is the proud spring beer festival of Germany. Attracting close to 2 million visitors every year, this festival offers great avenues for fun and entertainment that is popular with people of all ages. From confectionary stands to beer tents, from music shows to balloon glow and from modern and traditional fairground rides to the Ferris wheel and many roller coasters, this spring festival packs all kinds of entertainment. And like all festivals, it brings people together to live life and be happy. Thrown open to the people with a traditional beer keg opening ceremony, this festival lasts about 3 to 4 weeks and is a great getaway for family and friends on all days of the week. If you are planning a holiday to either Germany or specifically the Baden Wurttemberg area, this is one event you don’t want to miss. And may be, when you are taking part in this festival, it might be worthwhile to push up the fashion quotient by donning those traditional Dirndl dresses and Lederhoses. After all, it is total fun to look and play the part! Welcome to BE ON THE ROAD Travel Blog!
