I feel secure,\" she said.\nFrench President Francois Hollande presided over the yearly parade on the Champs-Elysees, meeting and greeting members of the military. Alongside him was his guest of honour, Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto, whose government is smarting following the audacious prison break of a major drug lord.\nThe parade gave special recognition to the three armies, more than 10,000 soldiers, who participated in France's stepped-up security measures following the attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. For the first time, accolades also went to emergency first-responders as well as several elite units of the national police force and gendarmerie specializing in counterterror and hostage kidnappings.\nHollande additionally commemorated the 70th anniversary of France's liberation from Nazi Germany, saluting members of France's Order of Liberation. The spectacle included nearly 100 military planes and helicopters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T13:06:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
