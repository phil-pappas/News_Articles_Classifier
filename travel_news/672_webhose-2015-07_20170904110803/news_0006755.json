The board members took the opportunity to meet with local tourism operators prior to the meeting, to discuss the tourism season and the extensive promotional programme which Tourism Ireland is undertaking to highlight Kilkenny, the South East and the island of Ireland around the world this year.\nSpeaking after the board meeting, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “We were delighted to be in Kilkenny for this month’s board meeting and to have the chance to meet with representatives of the tourism industry from Kilkenny and to hear directly how their business is doing. It also afforded us the opportunity to discuss the extensive promotional programme which Tourism Ireland is undertaking around the world this year, to build on the success of 2014 and continue to grow overseas visitor numbers to Kilkenny and the South East. Priority markets are Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France, but our promotions are also continuing in 18 other markets across the world – including Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Australia and New Zealand, as well as new and emerging markets like China and India.”\nKilkenny city and county, its events, heritage and visitor attractions, as well as many other aspects of the area, feature prominently in Tourism Ireland’s promotions around the world. Tourism Ireland recently launched a new online film, specially created to highlight one of our most exciting summer events – the Kilkenny Arts Festival – and to entice prospective holidaymakers from around the world to come and experience the great programme on offer and enjoy this historic city and its hinterland. The online video features wonderful images of Kilkenny – including St Canice’s Cathedral, Kilkenny Castle, the Black Abbey, St John’s Priory, Rothe House and The Hole in the Wall – giving people everywhere a flavour of what to expect when they visit.\nTourism Ireland profiles Kilkenny extensively on its global suite of websites, Ireland.com, which which attracted 14.25 million unique visitors in 2014. Kilkenny is also highlighted through Tourism Ireland’s social media platforms – to its 3 million active Facebook fans and 270,000+ followers on Twitter.\nIn 2014, Tourism Ireland helped generate almost €20 million worth of positive publicity for Kilkenny in key markets around the world, through press releases, press visits, e-newsletters and various media events. Tourism Ireland’s activity also includes co-operative promotions to highlight ease of access to the South East from Britain e.g. with VLM Airlines to promote their new flights to Waterford from Luton and Birmingham and with Irish Ferries to promote the service from Pembroke to Rosslare.\nPIC SHOWS: Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland; Aileesh Carew, Design & Crafts Council of Ireland; and Eugene Downes, Kilkenny Arts Festival.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland\nTags: Tourism Ireland , Tourism Ireland Promoting Kilkenny", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:11:10.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
