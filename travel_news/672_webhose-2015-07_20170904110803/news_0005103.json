The definition of flexible working covers anything from flexitime and part-time working to job-sharing and shift working. It can also cover hours, times of work, place of work and different patterns of work. It is clear that flexible working is being enthusiastically embraced by SME employees. A survey of 1,000 SME employees by Ipsos MORI and OnePoll found that more than a fifth (22pc) had requested flexible working as a direct result of the new legislation. The survey also found more than 80pc of employees who had been allowed to work flexibly said it had made a positive difference to their working life, with 52pc saying it made their work/life balance easier to manage and a third saying it made them more productive. Another third said it made them more motivated. It is built on the trust that our staff won't take advantage of us because they like working here However, the report also found that there was still a long way to go before flexible working became the norm, or was a possibility for everyone working for an SME. A total of 55pc of employees said their employer required them to work fixed hours in an office, and 44pc said they were not able to work remotely under any circumstances. But the past year has seen a change in attitude among some employers – having initially regarded flexible working as something purely of benefit to their employees, many employers are now realising it can improve productivity, lower overheads, and be a great way of attracting top talent into the business. A recent YouGov survey by Redcentric found that almost a third of UK workers were more productive when working remotely, while a survey by Jobvite found that 38pc of job candidates said their ability to work from home affected their decision of whether or not to take a new job. Francis Turner is managing director at Adyoulike, a digital business which allows its employees to work flexibly. He says: “As a start-up​ business working in and among the media and creative industries, it didn't make sense to force our employees to stick to a regimental start and finish. That policy belongs in the past. The standard 9-5 day just doesn't stack with the way we know people work. \"So we're flexible around what hours our staff start and finish. Obviously this is within reason and our staff still need to work their full days. But our flexible working is built on the trust that our staff won't take advantage of us because they like working here.“ He says the firm has seen many benefits to allowing flexible working, adding: “As a start-up digital business, we've grown exponentially across France, the UK and the rest of Europe. This also means that we're working with freelancers or staff working away from base, at home or in our different offices. \"Thanks to remote working methods, emails on phones and an internal cloud system, we're able to work as effectively as if we housed all our staff in one office. The main thing should be that if the job gets done well, then it shouldn't matter whether you're working in an office in Paddington or in your kitchen at home.” • Looking for the right company car for your business?
