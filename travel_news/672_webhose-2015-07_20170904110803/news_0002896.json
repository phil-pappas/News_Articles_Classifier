There is an optional excursion to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican museums at approximately €32 each. However, we have read about the long queues and wonder if it is worth pre-booking online? This apparently enables you to bypass the queues. Would this be a good idea and can you recommend a reliable website for such tickets please? Lee Marshall, Rome expert, writes It is most unlikely that the deal your operator has offered you does not include a time slot for entering the museums, leaving you, instead, to join the interminable queues of overheated tourists snaking around the Vatican walls. But, if necessary, you can arrange your own visit very simply – and considerably more cheaply – anyway, by booking a time and date through the museums’ website ( museivaticani.va ). For €20 per person, you get queue-free entrance. If you’d like to enhance your visit with a guided tour, you can book from a range, with varying prices, on the Vatican website. But external guides (who will organise priority tickets) are generally more rewarding than those provided by the museums. Knowledgeable Agnes Crawford at Understanding Rome ( understandingrome.com ) brings art to life, and the enthusiastic team at Eyes of Rome ( eyesofrome.com ) are always reliable.
