Lance underscored the important value of IT&CMA, “We invest in new platforms every year to explore their potential in a specific market. In line with our development and increased activities in Asia Pacific, IT&CMA became a natural choice partner. Asia-Pacific is a growing market for us, evidenced by the benefits we have experienced from the growing economies of various Asian countries. Exhibiting at IT&CMA enables us to engage with buyers, especially those from Asia, through the online appointment system and dedicated targeted events.” \nShe continued, “Our objectives for participating at trade shows entail increasing publicity awareness and positioning Dubai as a Business Event Destination, to generating a certain number of leads for our stakeholders and increasing contacts within the Southeast Market. With IT&CMA being the largest MICE trade event in the Asia-Pacific region, we are certain it is the platform for us to achieve those objectives.” Rising to 4th place in the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index, Dubai’s ongoing efforts to brand itself as a remarkable and unique destination for Incentive Groups and Corporate Meetings have resulted in growing visitor numbers to the city, with an estimated 14.3 million international visitors in 2015. On what buyers and visitors can expect at the Dubai Business Events’ booth, Lance shared, “We aim to educate meeting planners on our destination offerings and Dubai Business Events’ wide ranges of services. We will also showcase the various activities and venues that are highly recommended for incentive travel. At the same time, we will also share the tools we have available to incentivize group and incentive bookings. IT&CMA 2015 will be held from 29 September to 1 October 2015 at the Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld. It is co-located with the CTW Asia-Pacific – The Leading Corporate Travel Management Conference For the Asia-Pacific.
