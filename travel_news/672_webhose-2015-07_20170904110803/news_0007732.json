IBIZA ROCKS HOUSE AT PIKES , San Antonio\n'Attitude, atmosphere and authenticity' are the house rules at this boutique bolthole in the hills just outside San Antonio.\nAs Pikes, this Eighties institution became known for epic parties and A-list guest lists. Today, run by the Ibiza Rocks founders Dawn Hindle and Andy Mckay since 2011, Tony Pike is still a resident, the house still likes to party (especially on a Friday and a Sunday) and famous faces spotted during our stay included Carl Cox and Howard Marks.\nBut for the new bosses it's important to balance the naughty side with a bit of being nice to yourself.\nFounder Dawn says: 'So many people love coming to the Ibiza Rocks gigs and afterparties and want that nocturnal experience, but need the balance. We cater for that “forgotten” generation who want a bit of both.\n'There was a need to offer our clients an Ibiza Rocks experience from music to massage to yoga and beyond, all with a rock ‘n’ roll twist.\n'Attitude, Atmosphere and Authenticity' are the house rules at boutique bolthole Ibiza Rocks House\n'After running the world’s biggest club night Manumission for 15 years there comes a point when you grow up. You realise life changes, you and your desires and expectations change and that your body and the way you treat it also has to change.'\nDuring the day the vibe at Ibiza Rocks House is pure chilled villa party with many of the guests starting the morning with a yoga breakfast or fitness session in the Rockovery tent before chowing down on five star fry-ups or granola and then settling down to the all important business of doing not much by the pool\nThe 'house' likes to foster a home from home feel, combining boho Ibiza style with a bit of rock and roll decadence in its quirky rooms and intimate nooks designed for trouble.\nAs day turns to night two happy hours get the party started and the tapas with a twist menu at the Room39 restaurant keeps the fussy foodies happy.\nDuring the day the vibe is pure chilled villa party with many of the guests starting the morning with a yoga breakfast or fitness session in the Rockovery tent\nDuring our stay in early summer the house was calm and lovely, and on non-party days it is the perfect place to unwind and recharge.\nBut as home to the bands and DJ's playing Ibiza Rocks each week the parties are - of course - some of the most talked about on the island.\nOn Wednesday nights the VIP Ibiza Rocks after party draws a glittering guest list back to Freddie's suite (named after uber fan Freddie Mercury) - Kylie Minogue, Mark Ronson, Idris Elba, Damien Hirst, Pete Tong, Natalie Dormer and Jack Whitehall are a few famous faces spotted raiding the suites' mini bars in the last couple of years.\nAnd for those wanting to experience a more old school Ibizan style of hospitality, the Sunday lunches featuring a traditional roast with all the trimmings, poolside tunes from long term friends of the Ibiza Rocks family and killer cocktails, are the best way to finish the week.\nBasically, there's only one rule here: If you're going to misbehave do it in style.\nwww.IbizaRocksHouse.com for more information 2. THE HARD ROCK HOTEL IBIZA , Playa d'en Bossa\nA big, bold, beach side party pad that is more blinging vegas than Balearic boho.\nHard Rock is a hotel that demands you party like a rock star, from the chilled fizz thrust into your hand at check-in (whatever the time) to the shiny LG speaker docks and personal wine coolers in your room (which will probably have a view of the huge stage in the centre of the pool area).\nYou're not really supposed to sleep here, but if you do decide to hit the hay you'll find gorgeous bed linen beneath the snakeskin-covered headboards and - surprisingly - the hotel is actually pretty tranquil before midday with everyone sleeping off hangovers or making the most of the epic breakfast buffet.\nHard Rock is a hotel that demands you party like a rock star\nAfter lunch the sound systems around the two pools come alive - unfortunately to the sound of bad eighties rock on our visit, but this is the Hard Rock Cafe so prepare yourself for some painful ballads.
