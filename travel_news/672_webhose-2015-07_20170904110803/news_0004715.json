Photographer's Note \nCepilho Beach in Trindade Village This is a little place where you don´t need to spend much time, unless you really want to relax or have a romantic time with someone. Most people visit Trindade, while staying in Paraty, since Trindade is very close to it. A 150m wide horseshoe-shaped beach, with tubular and strong waves reaching 9ft (3m) in height, is the main attraction for surfers. With clear sand, it is excellent for sunbathing. Caution to those who want to bathe in the sea, since the current is strong and dangerous, not suitable for children or people who cannot swim. Theres a kiosk with a beautiful panoramic view of the beach \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:51:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
