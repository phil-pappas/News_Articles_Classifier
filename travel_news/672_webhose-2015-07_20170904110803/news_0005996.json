Credit card was the preferred payment method for purchases at luxury brand retailers and high-end restaurants, according to Visa Thailand country manager Somboon Krobteeranon. \n\"Thais are more inclined to find travel deals that reflect their budgets compared to global travellers. While both spend the majority of their money during the trip, interestingly Thais use credit cards more at destinations,\" he said. \nCash might still be king in Thailand, making up about 75% of consumer expenditure, but card payments are gaining ground, as 98% of Thai travellers carry payment cards with them, and almost two-thirds of those who own cards choose Visa as their preferred brand for overseas payments, he said. \nThai travellers typically prefer regional trips and the top destinations during the past two years are Japan, followed by Singapore, China, Hong Kong then South Korea. They spend about six nights by average per one trip while almost half of the travellers, who travel with companions, preferred to travel with a group of friends or colleagues rather than with their partners and spouses. \nAs more Thais travel overseas for leisure, they also intend to spend more while on holiday. They also expect their holiday budget to jump from 44,000 baht on their last trip to 83,000 baht for their next overseas adventure. Thailand's luckiest visitor \nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand has joined hands with Thai Airways to give away two economy class tickets to a Frenchman as a celebration of the country's 16 millionth visitor. The lucky man is Lefebvre Quentin who landed at Suvarnabhumi airport on July 15. \nThe activity is launched to support the \"2015 Discover Thainess\" campaign to highlight the endless charm of Thailand, according to TAT deputy governor for Marketing Communications Sugree Sithivanich. \nQuentin said that was surprised to receive two economy-class return air tickets from his home to Thailand along with a five-night accommodation voucher and a \"Thailand's Luckiest Visitor\" certificate. The tickets will have a validity period of one year. \nAccording to statistics from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, the total number of visitors to Thailand rose 30.31% to 15.81 million visitors from Jan 1-July 12 and the average income from international tourists was 741.12 billion baht, or 30.43% higher than the same period of last year. The ministry expects the total visitors this year to reach 28.8 million. Hotels update Evason Hua Hin has partnered with the Matthew Kenney Cuisine from the US to open a culinary academy.
