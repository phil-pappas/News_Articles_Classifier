But not everyone found it funny.\nEarlier this year, a group of Native American actors walked off a New Mexico film set over complaints that content in the film was offensive to their culture. The actors objected over the vile names of some of the characters, as well as a Native American woman urinating while smoking a peace pipe.\n\"It was just a misunderstanding and once the movie is out will be cleared up,\" Sandler told The Associated Press on Saturday on the red carpet for the world premiere of his new film, \"Pixels.\"\nSandler called \"The Ridiculous Six\" 100 percent pro-American Indian.\nProduced by Sandler's Happy Madison production company, the all-star cast includes Sandler (who also co-wrote it), Taylor Lautner, Steve Buscemi and Luke Wilson. It premieres Dec. 11 on Netflix.\n———\nFollow John Carucci at http://www.twitter.com/jacarucci\n———\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the actor in headlines to Sandler, not Sandberg.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/jacarucci"], "published": "2015-07-18T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:52:09.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
