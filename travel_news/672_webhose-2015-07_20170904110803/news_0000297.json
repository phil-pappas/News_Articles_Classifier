New figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show 563 were held or arrested by Port of Dover police officers last year, up from 148 in 2013. The figures obtained by the BBC emerged following a weekend of more disruption to cross-Channel services when around 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel terminal in France. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan are camped at a site near the Port of Calais. French aid workers say there is a \"catastrophic\" lack of food or shelter at the camp and there are predictions that some 2,000 more people could arrive in Calais over the summer. Illegal immigrants' routes to UK map Calais crisis: Migrants evade Government's '100 per cent' checks on lorries Lorry drivers have been advised by the Freight Transport Association not to stop within about 60 miles of Calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure their vehicles are padlocked. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has suggested French troops boost security at the port city as those desperate to reach the UK try to smuggle themselves onto lorries. Richard Burnett, the association’s chief executive, said: “I think it's a desperate situation for truck drivers. Scanners have been used to detect stowaways trying to smuggle themselves into Britain (EPA) \"Put yourself in their situation – you are on your own trying to get through and you've got 20 migrants around your truck trying to get on, and you're on your own trying to get them off. \"They are intimidating, some of them have metal bars, knives and, in one incident, a gun was pointed at a trucker.\" He added: \"Somebody is going to get killed. I think things are beginning to boil over.\" Mr Burnett said Britain is seen as \"too attractive a place\" for migrants to come to, and he called for a long-term solution involving governments and the EU.
