So goes the song by the Scottish pop band Deacon Blue. The towns are of course those of the west coast of Scotland, north of Glasgow – arguably one of the most beautiful parts of the world, never mind Great Britain. Cruising on “a ship called Dignity” you would pass the industrialised city with the ghosts of its shipbuilding heyday still apparent in the cranes that loom over the murky waters of the Clyde. But sail for less than an hour and the cranes and machinery are replaced with green, lush hills and blue waters. Passing the village of Bowling you see the old skeletons of merchant ships, long forgotten and left to rot. But, rather than being a scar, they add to the mystery and atmosphere of this part of the coast. Travelling north, the hills become more dramatic as the waters clear and the beaches become sandier and whiter. When the rare sun makes an appearance, surely there is nowhere better on Earth. It’s a place of history and beauty combined. Susan Park, from Argyll & Bute, wins a £350 DialAFlight voucher • 20 best hidden beaches in the UK More feedback from readers Chesil Beach Beginning at West Bay, Chesil Beach on the Jurassic coast of Dorset is pure pleasure. The shingled shore is backed by several pretty villages. Beyond Burton Bradstock with its thatched cottages, stop at Hive Beach café for a snack, continue on the B3157 coast road, and wonder at the 14th-century St Catherine’s chapel, high above Abbotsbury. Traditionally, spinsters can post a prayer for a husband there. Chesil Beach is peaceful, beautiful, and good for fishing and wildlife. Go to the Swannery, with its colony of mute swans nesting in the reeds. High above the subtropical gardens, the delightful road gives a really good view of the beach below. It’s sometimes a case of now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t, but the route always tantalises with what is to come. Portland Bill is visible as you sweep through Wyke Regis, site of many shipwrecks, in time to have a drink on the harbour front in Weymouth. • Britain's best beaches, according to TripAdvisor Gill Yardley, Coventry Hastings My favourite British coastline is not chosen for aesthetics, sandy beaches or clear, warm water. Instead, my love of Hastings, East Sussex, is based on family nostalgia. We used to visit every summer as my grandparents lived nearby, and I have happy memories of skimming pebbles in the sea with my grandad, exploring the smugglers’ caves and battlefield, seagulls stealing chips out of our hands, and losing many a jelly-shoe in the gloopy, quicksand-like mud that appears when the tide goes out. To this day, I still use a breakfast spoon that my uncle found while snorkelling 20 years ago. This wonderful place goes to show that you don’t need white sand and 30-degree temperatures to have a memorable time; just good company and a keen sense of adventure. Sam Weller, Leeds Fife We’ve just returned from touring the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland, walking the Fife Coastal Path. The landscape varied each day from easy beachside paths passing wildflowers and links golf courses, to a chain walk traversing the cliffs around the headland at Elie. On the days when we didn’t walk, we enjoyed delicious fare at the Crail Food Festival and a boat trip from Anstruther to the Isle of May where we saw nesting terns, pufflings waiting for their lunch of sand eels, and an eider duck with five ducklings on her back for the daunting swim back to the mainland. Our favourite stretch was from St Andrews to Kingsbarns where we overdosed on the sights, sounds and smells of the sea and coast. There are lots of campsites right on the coastal path, as well as an excellent coastal bus service. Linda Robinson, West Midlands Robin Hood’s Bay My favourite place is on the North Yorkshire coast – Robin Hood’s Bay. It is a beautiful little piece of the world with stunning views and a gorgeous beach. I used to love going there when I was a child, picking winkles with my dad. It truly is a little bit of heaven. Kendra Florence, Middlesbrough Great Yarmouth My favourite would have to be Hopton beach in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. It is a lovely sandy beach with a boat harbour at one end. It also has a rock pool area where you can go crabbing. The long stretch of coast has beautiful scenery and such friendly people. All my family love this part of England. Andy Burns, Kent Berry Head The stretch of British coastline that I love is Berry Head in Devon. It features an old Napoleonic fort, a nuclear bunker from the Cold War and one of the most beautiful nature reserves I have ever seen. You’d be hard-pressed to find such a spectacular mix of natural beauty and historical significance anywhere. Some may say that a stretch of coastline without beautiful beaches is not worth visiting, but I don’t believe this is true – and it certainly cannot be said about Berry Head. There is something utterly invigorating about being able to walk around a Napoleonic fort and enter the surviving rooms. The natural beauty at this spot is breathtaking and you could sit and watch nature at work all day without getting bored. Sophia Miller, Pontypridd Isle of Skye If I were a teacher at Elgol Primary School on the misty Isle of Skye, in Scotland, I think my pupils would learn nothing. I would spend the whole day gazing at what must be one of the most wonderful views in the world. Elgol sits on the tip of a finger of land stretching out into the Atlantic Ocean and looks out to the magnificent, brooding Cuillin mountain range. The Cuillin glower over the sparkling water; jagged-toothed, cloud-kissed, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. Alison Johnson, Fife • The 25 English beaches at risk of failing clean water regulations Northern Ireland My favourite section of coastline in Britain is the Causeway Coast in Northern Ireland, stretching some 33 miles from Portstewart to Ballycastle, passing through several areas of outstanding natural beauty, a World Heritage Site and places of special scientific interest. There are terrific views of wide bays, sandy beaches, dramatic cliffs and offshore rocks. From Ballycastle you can visit Torr Head, with its stunning views across to the Mull of Kintyre. Mary Hutton, Coleraine Northumberland This really is a Kingdom by the Sea, a county of endless beaches and imposing castles as well as puffins, terns and seals. Park in the lovely fishing village of Craster – enjoy crab sandwiches at the Jolly Fisherman – and head along the coast to the impressive ruins of Dunstanburgh Castle, isolated and majestic but with a harbour that once sheltered Henry VIII’s navy. Walk further on (it’s an easy ramble suitable for toddlers and oldies alike) to watch the bird life squabbling for space on the nearby cliffs, before discovering a suitable picnic spot among the dunes of Embleton Bay or relaxing on the grassy lawn in front of the inviting pub at Newton by the Sea. The sand is as white as the surf and the long, clean beaches are a Northumbrian secret we are glad to share.
