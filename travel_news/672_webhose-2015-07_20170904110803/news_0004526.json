The cards are already being sold at the company’s Tokyo Bay Ariake Washington Hotel. \nAvailability of the cards at Tokyo Bay Ariake Washington Hotel represents the first time Ninja SIM cards have been sold at a hotel. The hotel, near Odaiba and other popular spots in Tokyo, is in a prime location, especially for leisure travelers. A major renovation of the hotel’s 800 guest rooms was completed last year. \n“We constantly look for ways to make our international guests feel at home. This is our latest service,” said Akira Segawa, President and CEO of Fujita Kanko. “Japan is known for its advanced technology. We want our guests to have a mobile-friendly visit.” \nNinja SIM cards, developed by BIGLOBE Inc., a leading Japanese IT company, come in two sizes, nano SIM and micro SIM, and three capacities: 1GB, 3GB and 7GB, costing 3,000 yen, 5,000 yen and 8,000 yen respectively, including tax. The cards are valid for 30 days. Additional 1GB costs 2,160 yen. Written information is available in English and Chinese at the hotel. To maximize convenience for international guests, Fujita Kanko intends to expand the cards’ availability to other properties in its Washington Hotel and Hotel Gracery groups. \nAnticipating a growing number of visitors, Fujita Kanko is implementing new services targeting international guests. For example, designated staff at Hotel Gracery Shinjuku, opened in April and known for its Godzilla-themed rooms, provide local information and assist with various activities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T23:53:26.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
