She will retain the $500 per month car allowance she was receiving as deputy county administrator.\n“I’m glad it’s settled and look forward to moving the county to the next level,” said Baker, who will be the first black and the first woman to serve as county administrator in Palm Beach County.\nCommissioners, who picked Baker from a pool of 80 applicants , voted unanimously to approve the contract.\n“I’d like to congratulate Verdenia now that everything is squared away,” Commissioner Melissa McKinlay said.\nMcKinlay, who supported an external candidate for county administrator, was the only commissioner who did not have Baker as her first or second choice. Baker was the first choice of four commissioners, while two backed Assistant County Administrator Shannon LaRocque.\nBaker’s two-year contract begins on Aug. 27. As is standard, she will serve at the pleasure of the county commission.\nIf Baker is terminated for misconduct, she will get no severance. If she is fired without cause, the county must pay her no more than 20 weeks of compensation, as is required by state law.\nA salary survey provided to commissioners shows that Baker’s annual pay of $257,000 is in line with the pay of county administrators in other large, heavily populated counties in Florida.\nShe will earn less than the $266,916 Weisman makes but will be paid more than the county administrators in Pinellas, Orange, Leon and Volusia counties. Baker will make less than the county administrators in Broward and Hillsborough counties.\nThe salary survey also included the pay of city administrators in West Palm Beach ($210,894) and Pembroke Pines ($274,996). And it included the $325,000 salary of Palm Beach County’s new school superintendent, Robert Avossa.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/07/c6/9a/041513-LEG-Honorees-Verdenia-Baker.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-08T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:10:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
