However concerns over the practice have grown so much in recent times that the US State Department warned in its 2014 report on human trafficking that the culture of joshi-kosei dates was being used to facilitate the prostitution of underage children.\nA new documentary by Vice News called School Girls For Sale highlights how some girls are coerced into sex as the JK culture is used as a front for a system of sexual exploitation.\nThe opening remarks from Vice filmmaker Simon Ostrovsky casually lament the fact that the country has a “very high tolerance for the sexual exploitation of young girls”, while the documentary goes on to discover that the industry of hiring school high girls “is actually really big business in Japan”.\nThe images of school girls are used to sell all sorts of things in the Japanese capital. Source: YouTube\nPosters on the street advertise venues that are promoted as “cafes and JK” where men can go to get a drink and engage with school girls. One girl who works at such a place described it as “a store where you can chat with high school girls,” as she struggled to control her giggles.\nThe phenomenon of the walking dates began popping up in the nineties but was considered far more innocent and mostly involved men who were starved of companionship. However these days, the walking can often lead down a much darker path.\nThe problem with these walking dates is “the opportunity for that to turn into something really nasty are manifold”, Jake Adelstein told Vice News .\nHe is a board member of a non-government organisation aimed at combating human trafficking called the Polaris Project and says the JK culture is becoming increasingly more disturbing and increasingly more lucrative for the group of men who organise the girls.\nHe believes the misogynistic nature of Japanese society has allowed the schoolgirl obsession to flourish as numerous women come to view themselves “as sexual merchandise”.\nPosters of schoolgirls line the walls of many JK businesses.

And if sex was all it took to make me stop feeling so worthless, I thought I was game for anything.”\nYumeno Nito, is an activist who runs a support group called Colabo that helps rehabilitate exploited victims and has seen first-hand the effects the schoolgirl obsession has on the vulnerable teens who supply the demand.\n“Some men forcibly undress or kiss them, but that’s not the worst. Some girls are raped. One girl was even tied up sadomasochistic-style as photographs were taken,” she told The Japan Time s in November.\nShe said the “naive reaction” of the girls in response to sexual advancements can be a turn on for some of the men.\nSchoolgirls are a ubiquitous sight. Source: YouTube\nThe government is aware that JK businesses are using walking dates and other services as a cover for underage prostitution and has recently taken steps to crack down on the industry.\nIn 2013, police began raiding JK businesses hoping to catch them on alleged breaches of labour laws. In December of that year, they began rounding up many of the JK schoolgirls on the street and trying to convince them not to partake in the shady industry.\nWhile the occasional raid continues to be carried out, many have criticised the government’s response for being motivated by public relations and not a genuine desire to eradicate the problem.\nAt any rate, the crackdown has served to push the seedier elements of JK culture underground where the obsession with schools girls will likely remain and continue to manifest itself in troubling ways.\nWalking dates are not an unusual sight.
