Over the past few months, Implant Sciences has won a series of tenders in France , as well as throughout the EU.  Following its two recent airport tender wins in France , the company's ETDs have been selected for deployment in over 95% of the French airports that serve more than 500,000 passengers annually.\n\"We have announced, combined with our contracts with the Union of French Airports (UAF) and Nice, a total of up to 507 QS-B220s sold to French airports over the last three months, and up to 783 altogether across the EU.  We believe that there is additional opportunity for our systems over the next several years in France , as well as across the rest of Europe , as the EU ETD regulations for airports with fewer than 500,000 passengers are set to be implemented after the major airports' installation of ETDs is complete,\" stated Dr. Darryl Jones , Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing for Implant Sciences. \"The European market is as important to our expanding growth as the opportunity domestically is with the TSA, and we are pleased that our technology continues to receive favorable market acceptance.\"\n\"This is our third major contract in France . French airports have repeatedly chosen Implant Sciences over the competition because of our unparalleled non-rad expertise and superior product offering,\" added Richard Nelson , Implant Sciences' General Manager, EMEA. \"We believe that our competitors simply cannot match our systems' performance and value.  When tested side by side, our low false alarm rate and system reliability demonstrate why the QS-B220 has been chosen by key aviation customers worldwide, including French airports, the majority of other ECAC-driven European aviation security buyers, and, of course, the TSA in the US.\"\nAbout the QS-B220 Desktop Explosives Trace Detector \nThe QS-B220 uses Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) to rapidly detect and identify trace amounts of a wide variety of military, commercial, and homemade explosives. With significantly lower maintenance requirements than competing systems, the QS-B220 can be deployed for a much lower total cost of ownership than other approved products. Featuring a radioactive material-free design, push-button maintenance and diagnostics, and a patented inCalâ„¢ internal automatic calibration system, the QS-B220 brings new levels of performance and convenience to desktop trace detection users with unsurpassed ease of use.\nAbout Implant Sciences \nImplant Sciences is a leader in developing and manufacturing advanced detection capabilities to counter and eliminate the ever-evolving threats from explosives and drugs.
