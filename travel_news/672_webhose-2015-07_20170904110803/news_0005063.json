John King, Pacific Asia Travel Association and Pamela Lanier EcoGo org. \nConference lectures, panels, and plenary sessions will examine topics such as: case studies for successful partnerships in Indigenous tourism, winning formulas in eco-cultural tourism, and best practices to work in the Pacific-Asia marketplace. \n“We are excited to announce that representatives from Canada, the United States, Chile, Australia and New Zealand will be addressing conference attendees, providing insight into the growth of Aboriginal tourism,” says Keith Henry, CEO of Aboriginal Tourism BC, and host partner for the Pacific Asia Indigenous Tourism & Trade Conference. “Interest in Aboriginal tourism continues to expand on a global scale, and the tourism industry of British Columbia serves as an excellent catalyst for Aboriginal tourism products and experiences, helping to position our Aboriginal stakeholders as industry leaders.” \nThe host province of British Columbia is home to one third of Canada’s First Nations and the second largest Indigenous population and has experienced strong growth in Aboriginal tourism over the past decade. In 2010, 3.7 million visitors included Aboriginal experiences on their itineraries and spent $40 million learning about and experiencing First Nations culture. This represents nearly 100 per cent growth since 2006. Today, there are more than 200 Aboriginal tourism businesses in BC, an 85 per cent increase over 2006, which together contributes $561 million in value added GDP. \nThe second Pacific Asia Indigenous Tourism & Trade Conference will focus on the international opportunity for engagement and sharing by all peoples who have an interest in promoting, implementing and celebrating achievements in fostering Indigenous self-determination through participation in tourism. This focus is consistent with the principles of the Larrakia Declaration on the Development of Indigenous Tourism, which was adopted by the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) and endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in 2012. It represents the most important statement of commitment from the tourism sector that it intends to take on an active role in giving practical effect to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:54:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
