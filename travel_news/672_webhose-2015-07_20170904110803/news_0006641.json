Kristy Muir \nI had taken the joy flight from the quaint township of Boulder because I was time-poor and it was the fastest way to see it. \nBut it definitely was not the cheapest way to check it out, nor the best. \nGetting a bird's eye view of the area was incredible, although the actual ride was not my cup of tea - it was the middle of a hot summer's day and I was surrounded by glass. \nI chose the cheapest package which meant I missed out on landing and having a champagne picnic, one kilometre below the rim of the canyon. \nWhich is why, when I visited the Grand Canyon again, this time with my boyfriend, I opted to go by road and explore the area on foot. \nThe journey from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon, via the iconic Route 66, is long and hot, but worth every second. AIN'T IT GRAND?: Sunshine Coast Daily journalist Kristy Muir with her boyfriend Lion Goldsworthy. \nWe went during the peak-tourist season, and met so many great people, but for those wanting a solitary experience, the herds of people are not ideal. About five million people visit the Grand Canyon every year, most of them in summer. \nOn average, the canyon in reaches about 30 degrees along the South Rim and 39C at the bottom. \nThe canyon's heat is extremely dangerous and signs alert you to the number of people who die of heat and thirst hiking the canyon every year. \nAbout 12 people die each year at the canyon, an average of two or three deaths per year are from falls over the rim, as per the park date from May. \nThe Grand Canyon is the full package, with ravishing visual beauty; physical challenge (should you so desire); historic and cultural depth (American Indian split-twig figures found at the canyon are older than Stonehenge); and that rarest of experiences - a genuine encounter with the sublime. \nIt is not hard to see why the Grand Canyon took three to six million years to form. \nAnd its contours are still changing because of erosion. \nMy tips for anyone thinking about travelling to this natural wonder of the world - do your research, wear good walking shoes and have all the essential equipment for a hike. \nGrand Canyon by numbers Park statistics show that almost five million people visit the Grand Canyon each year and an average of 12 people die there annually. An average of two or three deaths per year are from falls over the rim. \nData: May 1, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:19:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
