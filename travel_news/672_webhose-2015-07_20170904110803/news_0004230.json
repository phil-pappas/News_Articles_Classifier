Guidebook Builder’s drag-and-drop interface empowers event organisers with no programming experience to easily build and manage mobile event guides while maintaining control of the content before, during and after an event. \nIn the past two years Guidebook users have launched 25,000 mobile guides designed to transform the attendee experience. From 100-person corporate training sessions to conventions with hundreds of thousands of attendees, Guidebook provides event organisers with an effective and low-cost solution to design, build and deploy mobile apps themselves. \"We’re thrilled with how the events industry has embraced Guidebook,” said Jeff Lewis, Founder and CEO. “We’ve found that because our product is so flexible and has a low barrier to entry, its uses have been as varied as our clients. “Event professionals have been in desperate need of a way to have complete control over their mobile apps. Guidebook Builder provides that solution and eliminates any need to deal with the bugs and crashes that come with custom development.\" Today Guidebook also makes its first funding announcement, disclosing it has raised $10 million to date in seed and Series A funding. London-based Mosaic Ventures co-led the financing with MHS Capital. With the help of its investors, Guidebook plans to continue its rapid growth in Europe and as part of the Series A financing Toby Coppel, one of Mosaic's founding partners, has joined Guidebook’s board of directors. “The Guidebook team has developed a best-in-class platform that offers a solution for any organisation in any industry to design and build a native app in an easy and low cost way,” said Coppel. “With the world of mobile apps changing quickly, multiple platforms to support, and good talent expensive to hire, Guidebook offers a compelling alternative to building an app in-house or outsourcing custom development. We’re excited to partner with Guidebook. The new platform enables them to expand the range of industries and customers they can serve, and we have no doubt that tens of millions of people will be using apps built by Guidebook in the next few years.” Guidebook is the only fully functional event app builder to offer a free version of its software. The company has lowered the traditionally high barrier to entry in the event app space by reducing the time it takes to launch a mobile guide to as little as an hour and by offering a subscription model which eliminates start-up fees and allows customers to predict ongoing costs. In just four years the Silicon Valley-based technology company has established a world-class client base within the events industry, including large events such as New York Comic Con and product launches, sales kickoffs, and other internal and external meetings run by organisations like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.
