United Airlines will reportedly end its nonstop service from Denver International Airport to Lafayette, Louisiana on Oct. 23. The airline only started serving the market with nonstop service since August of last year, and flew many Denver oil and gas employees to the Louisiana city. The Baton Rouge Advocate reported that Denver-Lafayette flights attracted many southern Louisiana families in the Acadiana area on their way to Colorado ski areas, and that airport officials were \"puzzled\" by United's move. “The load factors of passengers from Acadiana have been strong and we could have just as easily seen an announcement of increased flights as one that says the flights are ending in October,” said Steven Picou , Lafayette Regional Airport executive director, in a statement on the newspaper's site.
