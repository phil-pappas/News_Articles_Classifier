But blockades in the San José area caused many people to stay home, according to CACORE.\nRestaurants and bars surveyed by the chamber reported losses in sales up to ₡1 million each. Low affluence of customers also affected waiters’ tips, they reported.\nCANATUR also reported that porteadores blocked access for over 15 hours to the country’s two international air terminals: Juan Santamaría in Alajuela and Daniel Oduber in Guanacaste, causing many tourists to miss their flights.\nTour operators said Wednesday’s protests were a “violation of the constitutional right to freedom of transit” and said the government’s response to the roadblocks was too late.\nBlockades caused several traffic jams that lasted until President Luis Guillermo Solís ordered officers from the National Police and the Traffic Police to clear the roads at around 7 p.m. on Wednesday.", "external_links": ["http://www.concacaf.com/category/gold-cup"], "published": "2015-07-11T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:48:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
