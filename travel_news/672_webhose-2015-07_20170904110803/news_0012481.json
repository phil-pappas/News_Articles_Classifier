Check out the city's new riverside walkway, the 4.2km Hatea Loop, which connects the CBD's main attractions via pedestrian bridges. \n2 Tackle the trail \nTake a harbourside stroll in the Town Basin precinct for an insight into local arts and heritage. Attractions on the Sculpture & Heritage Trail include the Whangarei Art Museum, Claphams Clock Museum and Reyburn House Art Gallery. \n3 Enjoy the view \nHead up Mt Parihaka, the volcanic cone which dominates Whangarei's skyline, for views of the city and the rugged peaks of Whangarei Heads. \n4 Free fall \nVisit the Whangarei Falls by heading 5km from the city centre on the Tutukaka Coast Highway. Take the short loop track through native forest to the base of the 26 metre waterfall, or enjoy the view from three easy-access viewing platforms. \n5 Take on Tutukaka \nThis jaw-dropping coastline is not just a summer destination. Head up for the Tutukaka Coast Winter Festival (14-29 August) - the programme includes a raft race, drive-in movies, dragonboat regatta, fishing competitions and a craft beer fest. \nSee whangareinz.com for more information. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T22:34:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
