A protester outside the Prime Minister's office in Bangkok.

They want to preserve the beauty of the Andaman coast.

Plans to launch the bidding process were delayed until next month, which EGAT says is unrelated to the ongoing protests. \nThe coal plant is part of a critical energy infrastructure that will provide Thailand with energy security as natural gas reserves in the Gulf of Thailand dry up within 10 years, EGAT says. \nThe state power authority has said it envisions building nine coal power plants in the south over the next two decades. The popular tourist beaches may soon play host to an unlikely new fixture. Source: AP \nIt had planned to begin the bidding process on this one in advance of the environmental review to save time, a government official said. \n“I want to emphasise that this is totally legal and we will not sign any contract with the constructor who wins the bid process until we pass” the environmental assessment, Anuchart Palakawong Na Autthaya, head of environmental management for the project, told The Nation newspaper. \nKrabi remains Thailand’s second-largest area of sea grass beds, which provide a feeding ground for the near extinct dugongs, a manatee-like marine mammal. It is also one of Thailand’s major tourist draws. Tourism to the provinces along the Andaman coast generated more than 376 billion baht ($14.7bn) in 2014, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \nKrabi and some of the islands off its coast are known as Thailand’s most beautiful beaches, including Koh Phi Phi, which rose to international prominence after being featured in DiCaprio’s film. \nThe Save Andaman from Coal Network, a loose collaboration of environmental, agricultural, tourist and other groups from southern provinces, began demonstrations July 10 but say their demands — which include a three-year waiting period to see if the province can produce 100 per cent renewable energy — have been ignored. \n“I’ve seen the beauty of the Andaman Sea,” said Daodin Patavatto, a Buddhist monk joining the protests. “The Andaman is not for one small group of people. It’s for everyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T15:29:36.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
