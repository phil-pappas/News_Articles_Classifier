A Wall Street Journal article published Thursday shows that PIE has increased its number of total flights 93.9 percent since 2011, the highest in the nation. The flight-tracking and data firm masFlight analyzed flight schedules at domestic airports from the third week of July this year compared with the same week in 2011. By and large, the news was not good, showing a major contraction of flights at airports in Milwaukee (down 45.2 percent) and Cleveland (-44.6 percent), and incremental drops in Boston (-3 percent) and Phoenix (-4.5 percent). The hardest hit was Memphis, which lost 66 percent of its flights in the last four years. The plunge largely resulted from Delta shutting down its Northwest hub there after the two carriers merged. The study comes as the Justice Department investigates whether airlines colluded to reduce flight schedules collectively in order to hike prices. The airlines say the contraction has resulted from a merger trend that now finds the U.S. serviced by four mega-carriers. That has caused them to shrink or close hubs, many of them in smaller markets. PIE's rise can be attributed to essentially one factor: low-cost carrier Allegiant Air's continuing focus on the facility as one of its prime destinations. Allegiant regularly adds new routes at PIE — the number is now in the mid-40s — most recently Memphis. Orlando-Sanford International Airport, also a major Allegiant destination, saw its flight totals soar 71.4 percent in four years. Key West dropped 43.2 percent. WSJ did not include Tampa International Airport in its article. TBBJ requested from the airport a four-year comparison that corresponds to the WSJ survey. Those results are pending return. \nWant Tampa Bay Travel news in your inbox?
