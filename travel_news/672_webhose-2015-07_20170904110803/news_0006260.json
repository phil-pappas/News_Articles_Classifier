In an attempt to draw a line under the row it has released a statement saying the university is satisfied his resignation was received in \"good faith\". The statement follows a categorical denial by the university that it had offered him his job back but that he had refused it. In recent days anonymous sources had also said Sir Tim would not be reinstated to his honorary professorship. In the statement the university said: \"UCL Council, the university’s governing body, has today reviewed all of the circumstances of the resignation of Sir Tim Hunt as an Honorary Professor of the Faculty of Life Sciences on 10th June. \"Having seen the relevant correspondence, including the exchange of emails between Sir Tim and UCL, the Council is satisfied that his resignation was accepted in good faith. \"The Council unanimously supports the decision taken by UCL’s executive to accept the resignation. \"The subsequent extent of media interest was unprecedented, and Council recognises the distress caused to Sir Tim and Professor Mary Collins. The Council acknowledges that all parties agree that reinstatement would be inappropriate. Female professors call for end to Sir Tim Hunt sexism row Sir Tim Hunt (PA) \"Council recognises that there are lessons to be learned around the communication process. Consequently it has requested that the executive undertake a review of its communications strategy.\" Nearly two weeks ago UCL defended its decision over the resignation of Sir Tim Hunt. In a statement on the university's website, Michael Arthur, the president and provost of UCL, said that he regretted accepting Sir Tim’s resignation but reversing the decision would send out \"entirely the wrong signal\". The Nobel prizewinner quit as honorary professor at UCL after making a speech to female scientists and journalists in South Korea he was subsequently accused of sexism. He said: “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls … three things happen when they are in the lab … You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.” Professor Arthur said that Sir Tim’s \"struck a discordant note\" with the university’s ethos. He said: “Our ambition is to create a working environment in which women feel supported and valued at work. “There have been many calls for me to reverse my decision to accept Sir Tim Hunt’s resignation from his honorary post at UCL, but there have also been very significant representations to me not to do so, including, but not only, from women in science.” Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:29:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
