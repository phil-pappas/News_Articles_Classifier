The drivers, who have rejected a two per cent pay rise and a £2,000 bonus for working on the all-night service, start their working life on a salary of £49,673 , which is more than some hospital doctors earn. They then see their wages increase to between £50,000 and £60,000 a year in the first five years. Doesn’t appear to be an absolutely terrible deal. After all, doctors have to train for an average of 10 years, whereas you can become a Tube driver having left school at 16 with just two GCSEs. How much do tube drivers start on? Firefighter Nurse Teacher Policeman Tube driver Starting salary 21583 21692 22023 23317 49,673 But as a conservative, I think there are plenty of reasons to support the strike. I know that sounds absurd, but bear with me: 1. It’s an opportunity to remind people that Bob Crow, the leader of the RMT who died last year , lived in a council flat in a Labour borough in spite of being paid £145,000 a year . That doesn’t reflect well on the Labour Party and its allies in the trade union movement. The Chancellor put a stop to such abuses in yesterday’s budget. From now on, those living in subsidised housing who earn more than £40,000 in London (or £30,000 outside London) will have to pay the full market rent. 2. Anything that makes London a slightly more congested, polluted city, even for a day, should be welcomed as it will encourage organic-vegetable-eating, natural-child-birth-loving, Prius-driving Green and Labour voters to move to Brighton. A day doesn’t pass without an article appearing in the Guardian by some micro-brewery enthusiast announcing they’ve finally had enough of London. If the tube strike turns this trickle into a torrent, that’s a price worth paying. Toodle-oo, country mice. 3. Let’s not discount the possibility that the tube workers actually have a jolly good reason to be on strike – a reason so compelling that even Tories like me could sympathise. As with every strike that shuts down the London Underground, the actual reason for the dispute is so obscure – so deeply buried in the minutia of overtime rates and flexitime working – there’s a chance that these massively overpaid, knuckle-dragging troglodytes have a genuine grievance. Unlikely, I admit. 4. Personal fitness is, broadly speaking, a conservative cause, right? Taking responsibility for your own health, decreasing the burden on the NHS, etc. I’m sure gym rats are more likely to vote Tory, if they vote at all. Well, the tube strike may encourage people to explore other ways of getting to work – such as cycling or running – that end up becoming permanent habits. 5. Disruptions to the local transport network alert London-based companies to the numerous benefits of having their employees stay at home. Not only do the companies save money on office space and travel expenses, they can expect their employees to work harder. A recent study by a group of Standford economists found that many companies around the world, such as Ctrip in China, have boosted productivity by encouraging their employees to work from home. 6. It will help the licensed black cab trade. Why? Partly because more people will use them, but also because Uber are charging “surge” rates today, making them even more expensive than black cabs. That, in turn, will deter first-time buyers from using the service again. As a Tory, I’m conflicted about Uber. I like competition, obviously, but I’m also fond of black cabs – mainly because the drivers tend to be even more right-wing than me. Faced with a choice between Uber and black cabs, I think I’ll stick with the devil I know. 7. It’s a useful reminder of just how inflexible and intransigent public sector unions can be and, as such, a great advertisement for the new strike law the government intends to introduce . Under this proposal, a strike affecting vital public service would require the backing of 40 per cent of union members – a threshold today’s action doesn’t meet. Enjoy your last hurrah, Red Robbo. 8. Labour Party members and trade unionists will take note of the fact that tube staff are absurdly overpaid and, unlike the rest of us, they will think that’s a very good thing. Not only that, but they’ll attribute this to the “strong leadership” of the RMT provided by a self-proclaimed Communist. Hopefully, that will make them more likely to vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership election . 9) Finally, all challenges are welcomed by True blue Tories, including the challenge of getting to work when the Underground isn’t working. We love opportunities to demonstrate just how resilient and resourceful we are and, from that point of view, this strike is a gift. If you’re based in London and you made it into work today, take a straw poll of the people in your office right now. I bet a majority of them are Conservative voters. When the going gets tough, the Tories get going.
