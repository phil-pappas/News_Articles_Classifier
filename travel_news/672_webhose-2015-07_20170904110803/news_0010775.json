Over 50,000 people attend on Sunday. Also on Sunday is The Art market at the Place des Archives, where professional and amateur artists display and sell their works. Lille also has a Christmas market. Take the walking tour of Old Lille, or the new Flanders battlefields tour. More on Lille, France . \nBruges or Brugge is Belgium's most visited city, and for good reason. The well preserved old town offers a wonderful walking experience, taste chocolate, buy lace (and maybe a diamond or two) test a few beers and sit down to a nice meal after your canal trip. Bruges Guide . \nAntwerp is known for diamonds, but Belgium's second largest city is much more than that. Visit Peter Paul Ruben's house, gawk at Antwerp's rail station, called the \"Railway Cathedral\" and see the very well preserved printing museum, the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Antwerp Guide . \nAmsterdam is a favorite destination for most everyone. Get an Amsterdam Pass and roam this delightful city of canals. Mandatory pilgrimages include the Ann Frank House Museum, and the Rijksmuseum. Of course there's also the NEMO Science museum and the Van Gogh museum; the list is darn near endless. Amsterdam Travel Guide , or see Amsterdam Travel . \nCologne , Germany is a delightful city on Rhine river between Dusseldorf and Bonn. You'll want to see the amazing cathedral and the excellent archaeological museum nearby to study Cologne's Roman heritage. When you're done touring, satisfy your hunger (for days!) by chowing down on a pig's knuckle and kraut washed down by the local brew called \"KÃ¶lsch.\" Cologne is located at a key rail hub, so getting around by train is no problem. Cologne Travel Guide . How Many Days to Spend on Each Destination? \nThis is pretty much up to you, but I'll name some minimums. You need at least three days for the big cities like London and Amsterdam. Certainly London needs three or more. You can get by on one to two days in Antwerp, Bruges, Lille and even Cologne. \nThus, on a two week vacation, you can squeeze in five countries, at least four languages, and a vast variety of different cuisines, beers and wines. Can I do the Itinerary by Train? \nYes, the itinerary covers some huge cities you won't want to drive in, so it is meant to be done by Europe's efficient rail system. You'll need Eurostar tickets , (book direct) preferably booked in advance. (Read more on the Eurostar .) From there, you might consider a Benelux rail pass , which will get you travel on trains in Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg--you'll have to pay a bit for the trip to Cologne. Also interesting is the Rail/Drive Pass (buy direct)--you can get a three country pass that includes France, Benelux, and Germany. You get three days first class train and two days rental car in a two month period with this pass, which will allow you to enjoy the beautiful countryside of Belgium and Holland. When to Go \nI'd do this itinerary in late spring or early fall to avoid the crowds, but the summer weather will be as good as it gets. There are very few chances of sweltering on this itinerary, but you might consider taking or buying an umbrella at the first rain. More Information on Optional Destinations on the Itinerary \nParis is, well, Paris. You can't do it justice with fewer than three days, so don't even try. See our Paris Guide for more, or visit Paris Travel . \nLuxembourg is a fascinating and quite beautiful country. You'll want to visit to tell your friends you've been there if only to see the quizzical looks on their faces. Luxembourg Guide .
