Its positive impact in healthcare, for example, is quickly dispelling fears about how advances in artificial intelligence might harm the human race. Paul Chong, director of IBM Watson Group for Europe and the Middle East, explains... Recent scaremongering about the extreme implications of artificial intelligence should not detract from the power for good this kind of technology offers - in allowing complex scenarios to be investigated at high speed, overcoming the natural limitations of the human brain. In healthcare, augmented intelligence (as I prefer to think of it) is already helping clinicians to find cures for cancer and achieve other medical breakthroughs in an unprecedented timeframe. The challenge until now has been how to put findings in meaningful context Powerful analytics technology has transformed our ability to process high volumes of data very quickly. The more that sensors are connected to networks over wireless and mobile networks, the greater the scope and volume of data that can be collected for analysis. The challenge until now has been how to put findings in meaningful context – and it is here that augmented intelligence has a vital role to play. In healthcare, the ability to compare individuals’ medical data with knowledge built up from historical records, and readings submitted using consumer mobile health apps, is giving researchers a bigger pool to work from, so that patterns and anomalies can be more easily identified. IBM Watson cognitive computing technology is the engine behind this, and a recent alliance with Apple will mean we can draw data directly from mobile health apps on Apple devices with consumers’ permission. At this year's Wimbledon , the same IBM technology will allow the All England Lawn Tennis Club’s (AELTC) digital teams to bring current match statistics to life in new ways for fans worldwide. There are many reasons why this is important. The AELTC is continually striving to give fans more of what they want, to keep them engaged and maintain Wimbledon’s unparalleled global reputation. In a digital age, that means delivering the latest news and insight instantaneously – while journalists from all over the world are looking to also report on the same matches and stories. Fans have higher expectations each year, so the AELTC must keep impressing them with ever deeper insights into play, served at velocity. Meeting this kind of demand doesn’t allow time to pore over the figures or the history books. The ability to perform queries using natural language will save valuable time AELTC’s digital team needs to be able to create an instant narrative, by discovering how the latest matches and record-beating serves compare with recent and historic performance, and extrapolating how this and other recent key performance metrics could affect the outcome of the tournament. This year, for the first time, the digital team will be able to phrase questions in their own words when searching for those rapid-fire insights. The ability to perform queries using natural language will save valuable time in sifting through the detail. Watson technology does the rest, learning and adapting as it goes to build an ever richer archive of contextual knowledge about tennis, so the output keeps improving and impressing. These are just two scenarios where augmented intelligence can overcome human limitations and add real-life value. The wider potential and opportunities are significant and continuously evolving, just like Watson. Watch out for Watson Analytics in action at Wimbledon: • Player performance reports – in-depth analysis of play, giving competitors a new game plan in plenty of time for their next match • Analytics through the ages: Wimbledon has a rich data set of results, scores and statistics dating back to 1877. Watson Analytics can combine this with current data to deliver very detailed insights to the people who crave them – as soon as they need them, and wherever they are As told to Sue Tabbitt Do you have the speed and accuracy to make the team?
