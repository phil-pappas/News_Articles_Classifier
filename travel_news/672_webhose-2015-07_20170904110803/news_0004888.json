The massive elk, moose and buffalo heads are back up. The lion, tiger and bearskin rugs are back down, and the Lincoln, Jefferson and Grant portraits have been cleaned. \nSagamore Hill, the Long Island mansion that was Theodore Roosevelt’s home and “summer White House,” reopened this month after an extensive four-year, $10 million renovation by the National Park Service, a fitting custodian for the man who championed historic preservation. \nEach of 12,000 items owned by the 26th president, including an estimated 10,000 books and dozens of “trophies” from his hunting expeditions, were removed from the Queen Anne shingle-style mansion, then painstakingly repaired and replaced exactly where he left them. \n“We hope that if he walked through the front door right now, he would think he was back during the presidential years,” said Susan Sarna, curator at Sagamore Hill for the past 25 years and project manager for the renovation. “We really do feel if he was in the library, he would feel like he was brought back in time to his home.” \n*** \nNational Park Service officials received funding for the project in 2008, and after three years of planning — and packing — actual construction began in 2011. In addition to other improvements, the roof was replaced, the foundation repaired and the entire electric system rewired. \nThe three-story home with 28 rooms, built in 1885 and named by Roosevelt after the Indian chief Sagamore Mohannis, has 15 bedrooms and three bathrooms as well as sitting rooms, offices and a large porch. It sits on 83 acres high atop a hill overlooking an inlet that leads to the Long Island Sound, about 35 miles east of Manhattan. \n“This is the only home he actually owned. It was the summer White House; he was the first president to actually work during the summer because of the invention of the telephone,” Sarna said. \nYanek Mieczkowski, a history professor at Dowling College on Long Island, said the larger-than-life Roosevelt had a reputation for traveling the globe, but he always returned to the Long Island home where he died in 1919. \n“Spending summers there, he camped, hiked, hunted, fished and rode horseback with his family — pursuits that he enjoyed and that matched his formidable energy,” Mieczkowski said. “Roosevelt made the presidency portable by bringing staff and paperwork to Sagamore Hill, but the retreat also functioned as his release valve.” \n*** \nSarna contends that scholars who study Roosevelt can never completely understand the man without visiting Sagamore Hill. \n“This home is his life. You look at his library and everything in there is what he surrounded himself with,” she said. “If you really want to know exactly who this man is, you need to come here and sit in his chair, so to speak. He said Sagamore Hill was his favorite place.” \nThe first floor features his office/library, where he entertained visiting dignitaries and held preliminary talks aimed at ending the Russo-Japanese War. \nA bright sitting room, decorated with colorful paintings selected by his wife, Edith, sits opposite the library. She insisted no animal heads were permitted there, Sarna said. \nA long, dark hallway featuring a large head of an African cape buffalo over a fireplace leads to the North Room, or trophy room. It is adorned with numerous elk and buffalo heads and dozens of mementos. Roosevelt’s Rough Rider hat worn during the Spanish-American War is perched on the antlers of one elk head, exactly where he kept it when he was alive, Sarna said. \nThe second floor has the family’s living quarters, where the Roosevelts reared six children. \nA prolific writer and reader, Roosevelt was known to read as many as two books a day and wrote about three dozen of his own. \nSarna, a former teacher, particularly enjoys visits from schoolchildren. \n“Maybe they’ll be inspired to be a better person or take one of his writings and actually read it. If we can do that then we’ve actually done something.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T15:31:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
