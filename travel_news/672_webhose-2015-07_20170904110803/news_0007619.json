A young face, for sure. Brandt, and the many other local aspiring film directors, producers and more in the industry, got a huge pat on the back July 8 when a $50,000 cash fund was created to help local filmmakers. “There is a tremendous amount of support for the arts in Milwaukee, with organizations like UPAF, and others,” said Jonathan Jackson , leader of Milwaukee Film. “There just has not been enough direct support to artists. Now there is.” The Brico Forward Fund, in its inaugural year, will include a $50,000 cash pool and another $75,000 of in-kind services including camera and lighting rentals, post-production audio and more. There is a high-powered list of contributors to the fund and it is led by $20,000 from The Brico Fund of Milwaukee. I had a chance to watch Brandt make a funding pitch for her current project, “ Dear Coward on the Moon,” recently at the University Club. The film, currently shooting with Hollywood class actors in western Wisconsin, is about two young women facing struggles between family obligations and personal independence. Like any film, financing is crucial. Brandt, despite her age, is no rookie. A graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee film department, she already has one feature film and many shorts to her credit. I also watched Brandt in action recently, holding a microphone boom for another local director’s film shoot. That’s part of the burgeoning Milwaukee film community, which has been catalyzed by the Milwaukee Film Festival, where films shot by local filmmakers have proven among the most popular — even against world class films. In fact, this year’s festival drew 177 entries from local filmmakers, up from 135 in 2014. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
