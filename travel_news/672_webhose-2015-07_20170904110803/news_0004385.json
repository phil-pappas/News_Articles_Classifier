However, in the last decade, the Sri Lankan population growth in the borough has created a “Little Sri Lanka ” in the Tompkinsville and St. George neighborhoods.\nStaten Island is home to the city’s largest Sri Lankan population. Though a decades-long civil war in Sri Lanka escalated tensions between Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups, here the two groups live peaceably in clapboard houses and brick town houses with modest, fenced-in front lawns.\nLittle Sri Lanka, where everything from Sri Lankan beer to homemade curry powder can be found, is not quite as bustling as Little India in Jackson Heights, Queens, lacking the many grocers, jewelry shops, restaurants and beauty salons with Bollywood music blaring from storefronts.\nBut Little Sri Lanka’s restaurants are the emotional heart of this growing community. Some of the best spots to sample Sri Lankan cuisine in New York lie along Victory Boulevard in Tompkinsville and farther afield on Bay Street in the nearby Stapleton neighborhood.\nPhoto San Rasa calls its dishes a more refined, nuanced approach to Sri Lankan cuisine.

The restaurant, in shades of red and dark wood, is decorated with trinkets from Sri Lanka. “When I started the restaurant I didn’t even have five or six people for the Sunday buffet,” he said. “Now I have 80.”\nCustomers, a mix of Sri Lankans and non-Sri Lankans, pack the restaurant in the evenings as well. He prides himself on bringing what he calls a more refined, nuanced approach to Sri Lankan cuisine. A signature dish is his version of lamprie (also known as lamprais or lamprey). This relic of Dutch colonialism arrives in a banana leaf, and is unfolded to reveal rice, meat, curried vegetables, and even cashews.\nPhoto Lamprie is a signature dish at San Rasa, served in a banana leaf.

The 15-year-old restaurant is unassuming, offering a fast-food counter, cafeteria-like tables and cricket matches streaming on the TV. But what the place lacks in style, it makes up for in substance.\nThe genial face of New Asha, Vijayakumari Devdas (known as Viji), runs the establishment with her husband, Devdas Ceruphatie; her brother Subhaschandraboase Ranakisana; and her brother’s wife, Udayakumari Subhaschandraboase. Viji has no professional culinary training, yet skillfully serves up curried jackfruit (a starchy fruit tasting like a cross between a banana and pineapple), malu paan (a fish and potato bun eaten for breakfast or as a snack) and Asha’s chicken (a spicy fried chicken house specialty) to Sri Lankan expats yearning for a taste of home and to patrons eager to try something new.\nOne of the most authentic Sri Lankan dining experiences in Staten Island can be found a 10-minute bus ride away on Bay Street in Stapleton at Lakruwana . Diners sit on elongated triangular-shaped metal chairs, studying menus of hearty, home-cooked meals. Jayantha Wijesinghe grew up cooking with her mother in Sri Lanka, and opened Lakruwana with her husband, Lakruwana Wijesinghe. Sunday brunch includes more than 20 dishes, such as pineapple curry, kale and coconut, and green egg curry.\nSuresh Seneviratne, a marketing director in Manhattan who moved from Sri Lanka to the United States as a child, visits Little Sri Lanka often and said he wishes the community were larger. “I can only hope that it will turn into a Little India — how fun that would be!”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/travel/19HEADS3/19HEADS3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/travel/19HEADS2/19HEADS2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/travel/19HEADS3/19HEADS3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/19/travel/19HEADS2/19HEADS2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://www.lakruwana.com/", "http://www.sanrasa.com/"], "published": "2015-07-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:11:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
