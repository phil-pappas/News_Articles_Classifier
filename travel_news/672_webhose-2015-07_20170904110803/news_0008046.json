Olivier Widmaier Picasso, grandson of Pablo Picasso and author of Picasso, Portrait Intime (Albin Michel/Arte éditions), has curated the exhibition, hand-selecting 30 photographs from the archives of Paris Match, the famous French weekly magazine. \nThis worldwide exhibition will be showcased at three Sofitel hotels in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou in China from September onwards. The China exhibitions are part of a world tour that has already been to five cities in North America and five in Europe. Aside from China, “Revealed” will also take place this year in Bangkok, Auckland, Sydney and Melbourne. \nAmong the prized photographs to be displayed is a black-and-white image of Pablo Picasso eyeing a Dalmatian longing to climb upon his lap; Salvador Dalí seen sitting in an animal exhibit at the Paris Zoo; Jeff Koons styling a BMW for the 24 Hours of Le Mans; Pierre Soulages crouching over a work in progress; Kees Van Dongen painting a posing Brigitte Bardot; and other striking images depicting Rene Magritte, Marc Chagall, Fernando Botero, Joan Miro, Jean Cocteau, Francis Bacon, and more. \n“As an international ambassador of French elegance, Sofitel links its collection of addresses with culture, and collaborates with celebrated artists, writers and photographers,” says Michel Molliet, Senior Vice President, Operations, Luxury and Upscale, AccorHotels Greater China. \n““Revealed” offers a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the artistic process as inspiration comes to life through expression. It is my distinct pleasure to bring “Revealed” to China as this compelling exhibition takes an intimate look at the world’s greatest modern artists at work: from Picasso to Dali, Chagall to Jeff Koons, Miró to Matisse.” \nTo launch the “Revealed” exhibitions in China, Olivier Widmaier Picasso will be in Beijing to personally meet guests and open the exhibition on September 1st, 2015. “We are delighted to have been able to draw on the talent of Olivier Widmaier Picasso and to have him in Beijing in person to launch “Revealed”,” continues Michel Molliet. “We are also proud to uphold Sofitel’s pillar of culture, which together with gastronomy, design and well-being combines into the French art de vivre that flows through our 120 Sofitel addresses on five continents.” \n“Revealed” by Sofitel will be on exhibit in the following hotels in China throughout the Autumn of 2015 at: \nSofitel Beijing Wanda – September 1, 2015 to September 20, 2015 Sofitel Shanghai Hyland – October 13, 2015 to November 2, 2015 Sofitel Guangzhou Sunrich – November 13, 2015 to December 3, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:25:29.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
