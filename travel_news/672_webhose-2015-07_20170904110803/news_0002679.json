They also said its progress in cutting costs suggested that some investors had been too cynical about the chances of hitting margin targets. \nAga Rangemaster shares jumped 38.9 per cent in the week after Middleby agreed to buy the oven maker £129m cash. N+1 Singer said a counter bid looks unlikely but cannot be ruled out as the window for a higher offer is open until mid September. \nAim-quoted Phorm enjoyed a 42.9 per cent share price rise after founder Kent Ertugrul stepped down as chairman and chief executive. Since 2002, Phorm has burnt through an estimated $250m trying to commercialise its web monitoring system. \nBut a profit warning from Johnston Press , the local newspaper publisher, sent its shares down 26.2 per cent. Advertising and circulation both declined about 5 per cent amid general election uncertainty and a second quarter slowdown. Shares in sector peer Trinity Mirror , which had warned on the ad market in June, fell 7.7 per cent. \nInvista European Real Estate shares fell further, down 68 per cent after it said a tenant default meant that it had to sell assets to satisfy lenders, with a risk that nothing would be left for shareholders. \nRurelec shareholders reject proposed chief executive \nRurelec, the struggling South American power generation business, had another turbulent week, with more than 90 per cent of shareholders rejecting the appointment of three board directors on Tuesday, including the new chief executive, writes Kate Burgess . \nThe shares fell 30 per cent the following day, after Rurelec said that the provider of a $12m bridging loan would not hand over the money until the company could clarify how the debt would be repaid. In June, Rurelec said it would concentrate on its core of “clean” gas projects in Argentina and was raising a bridging loan against the sale of its Peruvian hydroelectric schemes. \nThe company repeated last week that it still expected to repay all its loans from asset sales and on Friday the shares bounced 10 per cent, after it said it sold a Peruvian plant for $6.8m. But at 2p they remain a very long way from 2014 highs of more than 12.5p. \nRurelec was awarded $41m last year for assets nationalised in Bolivia, having claimed $142m through the arbitration court in The Hague. \n32Red buys Roxy Palace as online gaming consolidates \n32Red , the Aim-traded online gambling site, narrowly pipped 888 Holdings and Ladbrokes to become the first company to do a deal this year, as the gaming industry continues to consolidate, writes Malcolm Moore. \n32Red said on Tuesday that it had bought Roxy Palace, a casino gaming site with 230,000 registered players, for £8.4m — £2m in cash and the rest in new shares. Last year, Roxy Palace reported revenues of £10.1m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £1.6m. \nEd Ware, 32Red’s chief executive, said the two companies use the same Microgaming platform, which will help a smooth integration. \nDespite the new share issue, Numis, 32Red’s broker, has raised its earnings per share forecast 28 per cent for 2016 to 8.8p and put a 120p price target on the shares. 32Red’s share price fell 3.6 per cent to 71p on Friday. \n32 Red, which has been building its brand by sponsoring football clubs as well as Late Night Film on Film4, needs to build scale in common with other gambling companies as the sector begins a wave of consolidation. \nNo let-up for New World as shares resume trading \nShares in New World Oil and Gas , the Belize-focused explorer, dropped 70 per cent on Friday when they resumed trading after a two-month suspension., writes Conor Sullivan . \nDealing had been halted in May because of delays in settling trades and uncertainty relating to a share placement. Before the suspension, the company had said it wanted to raise £1.5m via share sales. This led some traders to bet against the stock without realising that the fundraising was subject to shareholder approval, which was then denied. Then, last month, the company announced a share placement, which raised £3.5m at a 65 per cent discount to the last-traded price in May. \nDuring the share suspension, the company announced full-year results that showed losses were broadly unchanged on 2013, at $11.7m. It said that it had cash of $330,000 — enough to keep it going for three months — executive directors’ salaries had not been paid since February. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
