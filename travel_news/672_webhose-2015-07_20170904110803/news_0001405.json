Source: AP \nSOMETIMES, the most incredible places you can visit aren’t the most famous. \nTake, for instance, the fortress island Gunkanjima, near Nagasaki. It’s just been awarded world heritage status after Japan and South Korea resolved a spat over whether to acknowledge the site’s history of wartime forced labour. \nJapan had applied to list Gunkanjima, or Battleship Island, as a world heritage location along with almost two dozen other sites to illustrate the country’s industrial revolution during the 19th century. \nBut until recently, Seoul had objected to the listing unless the role of Korean prisoners forced to work there during World War II was formally recognised. \nThe decision by the UN cultural body UNESCO is likely to drive up tourism to the Nagasaki region. Similar listings for the Zollverein coal mine complex in Germany’s Ruhr Valley have helped boost visitors to those sites in recent years. \n“Japan is prepared to take measures that allow an understanding that there were a large number of Koreans and others who were brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites,” the Japanese delegation said after the decision. \nMore than a dozen other sites have also been granted world heritage status in recent days. Their history is rich, and many of them are worth visiting. They include: \n• The 18th century Spanish-built San Antonio Missions in Texas, US.

Along with surrounding villages and the historic centre of Dijon, the site represents an industry in existence since at least the 12th century. \n• Champagne, the sparkling wine distinctive of the eponymous French region, represented in the vineyards, the cellars where the bottled wine ferments a second time, and the storeyed sales houses. \n• The Diyarbakir Fortress and Hevsel Gardens of Turkey, which goes back to ancient Greek and Roman times. \n• The Par Force Hunting Landscape northeast of Copenhagen, a sculpted woodland where Danish kings hunted with hounds until the 18th century. \n• A Lutheran church settlement known as Christiansfeld, also in Denmark. Founded in 1773 in the region of South Jutland, the town was built around a central church square to represent the democratic ideal of this Protestant denomination. \n• Tusi sites in southwest China, named after the tribal chiefs who ruled there from the 13th to the early 20th century. \n• The archaeological mounds and Ardeshir’s palace along the Shavur River in Iran. Known as Susa, the site was continuously settled from the 5th century B.C. until the 13th century. Ardeshir’s palace.

Tradition holds that it is the site of Genghis Khan’s birth and burial. \n• Sicilian churches and palaces dating back to the island’s 12th-century Norman rule, which incorporated Arab and Byzantine culture. \n• Christian pilgrimage sites in modern Jordan where Jesus is said to have been baptised, along with Roman and Byzantine remains in the area. \n• Prehistoric rock art showing human and animal figures in Saudi Arabia’s Hail Region. \n• Hamburg’s Speicherstadt district, a vast complex of red-brick warehouses built between 1883 and 1927 in Germany’s biggest port.

Located southeast of Haifa, Israel, the site features inscriptions in Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew. \n• Scotland’s Forth Bridge, completed in 1890 to carry trains over the Forth River and still in use today. \n• The ancient Greek and Roman settlements at Ephesus in Turkey, once the site of the Temple of Artemis — one of the ‘Seven Wonders of the World.’ A Christian chapel from the 5th century has also become a major pilgrimage site. \n• The Aqueduct of Padre Tembleque Hydraulic System on the Central Mexican Plateau. Dating back to the 16th century, the canal system was conceived by a Franciscan friar and combines Roman hydraulics and traditional Mesoamerican construction techniques. \n• Uruguay’s Fray Bentos industrial site set up in the 19th century to process and export meat to Europe. \n• The Blue and John Crow Mountains, Jamaica’s first world heritage site. Located on the southeast of the island, they became a refuge for indigenous people and escaped African slaves during colonial times and are considered a biodiversity hotspot.
