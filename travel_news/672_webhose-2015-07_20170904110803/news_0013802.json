An increase in the number of visitors from the West Coast has helped to offset a decline in the number of visitors from Japan this year. In June, the number of visitors from the U.S. West market rose 8 percent to 343,941, from 318,358 in June 2014, helping to boost the total for the first half of the year to 1.7 million, an 8.7 percent increase from 1.6 million during the first six months of the year.

Likewise, an increase in the number of visitors from the U.S. East market helped to offset a decline in the number of visitors from Canada last month. There were 186,795 visitors from the East Coast in June, an 8.5 percent increase from the 172,235 visitors from the East Coast who came to Hawaii in June 2014, while the number who came during the first half of the year increased by 1.8 percent to 929,980, from 913,889 during the first half of 2014.
