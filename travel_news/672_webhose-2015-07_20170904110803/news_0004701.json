In Hawai‘i, this program funds federal agricultural inspectors at airports on Kauai, Maui, Oahu, and Hawai‘i Island. It is critical to conduct inspections at the neighbor island airports so that passengers can directly connect to flights to the mainland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:01:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
