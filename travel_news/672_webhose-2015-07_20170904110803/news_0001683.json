At 33, you’d think the end is coming; it’s just a matter of when for J-Pod. Midfielder Scott Thompson (32) is one of the wiser heads of the Crows midfield but has looked as good as any of the league’s prime movers this year and will be looking for a new contract. Sadly, Brent Reilly ’s career has already ended after that shocking incident in the pre-season.\nJames Podsiadly hasn’t played a senior game for the Crows this season. Picture: Sarah Reed Source: News Corp Australia\nBRISBANE LIONS\nTrent West and Luke McGuane might be 27 and 28 years old but injury has cruelled them throughout their careers and 2015 has been no different. Neither have featured for the injury-ravaged Lions this season after West ruptured his ACL mid-last season and McGuane battles a niggling knee problem. Both could get a tap on the shoulder. Brent Staker (31) has again had his injury problems this year but has returned to the Lions side in recent weeks, adding some much-needed height up forward. This could be his last hurrah. Daniel Merrett is 30 and missed almost three months with a hamstring but is desperately needed at both ends of the ground. Matt Maguire has already announced his retirement after an injury-plagued career.\nCARLTON\nSome hard decisions will be made at Carlton at the end of the season. Andrew Carrazzo is out of contract at the end of the season and has contacted the AFL about a career in umpiring . Kade Simpson (32 in September) is contracted until the end of next season and still has plenty to offer the young Blues and his new coach. Chris Judd has sadly already been forced to call it quits. Andrew Walker (29) is also contracted to the end of next year.\nAndrew Carrazzo has been a great contributor for the Blues throughout his career. Picture: Alex Coppel Source: News Corp Australia\nCOLLINGWOOD\nNathan Buckley has done a running rebuild, with many of the Pies’ ageing premiership stars already moved on in the past two years. With a list bulging with top-end talent, there aren’t many nearing the end of their careers. Clinton Young (30 in February) is in the last of a three-year deal with the Pies and has had another injury-interrupted season, failing to feature at AFL level so far. Dane Swan is contracted until the end of 2016 and hasn’t ruled out extending his career into 2017, much to the delight of Magpie fans: “If I’m still going OK, the club still wants me and there is a spot for me somewhere, maybe (I’ll play for) another year,” he said ahead of his 250th game. “But there is still bit of footy to go before I start worrying about 2017.”\nESSENDON\nAlmost certain to miss the finals, the critics are out and Essendon’s list profile is in the spotlight. Jason Winderlich (31) reneged on his decision to retire at the end of last season but it hasn’t brought much joy given he’s spent most of the year out injured and managed only one game at senior level. Paul Chapman (33) has been the sub, been subbed and suffered injuries as his career nears its end and Dustin Fletcher hasn’t played since hurting his groin in his 400th game. Could that be his final AFL game? Jobe Watson and Brendon Goddard have both ticked over 30 but won’t be thinking about retirement any time soon.\nEssendon’s Dustin Fletcher is stranded on 400 games because of a groin injury. Picture: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia\nFREMANTLE\nCould a premiership mean the end for some Docker favourites? Matthew Pavlich (33) has been very quiet in recent weeks with some speculating the game might just have caught up to the Fremantle champ. Luke McPharlin is a rock down back and despite being 33 is still one of the league’s best defenders and has so far enjoyed an relatively injury-free year and could potentially go around again. Like Pavlich, his contract expires at the end of the season, but ruckman Aaron Sandilands (32) has signed a new deal to play on in 2016. Ryan Crowley is be eligible to return from his drug suspension on preliminary final weekend but he’s out of contract at the end of the year — will Fremantle give him a new deal for 2016? Colin Sylvia has already retired.\nWill Matthew Pavlich wave goodbye at season’s end? Picture: Daniel Wilkins Source: News Corp Australia\nGEELONG\nSpeculation has already begun at the Cattery about who will stick around and who will be told their time is up, in the same vein as premiership hero like Paul Chapman. Jimmy Bartel (31) says he wants to play on and after racking up 41 disposals against North Melbourne in his first game back from a knee injury, who can blame him. Corey Enright (33) has said this year will be his last but is still playing good footy and could keep going. Andrew Mackie has struggled and could make way for the likes of Jake Kolodjashnij down back. James Kelly (31) has produced good football at times this year but was given the green vest, and the same could be said for Steve Johnson (32). Mathew Stokes (30) is past his best and ruckman Hamish McIntosh seems destined to join good friend Nathan Grima in retirement after more injuries this year.\nSteve Johnson has been sub for the Cats this year. Picture: Colleen Petch Source: News Corp Australia\nGOLD COAST\nNot many oldies on the Suns’ list. Former Tiger and Lion Andrew Raines (29) was recruited for his experience and leadership to the emerging team and can offer that for another year at AFL and NEAFL level. Greg Broughton (28) was delisted then redrafted as a rookie at the end of last year but has managed just four games this season due to a knee injury. With the emergence of the likes of Kade Kolodjashnij and Adam Saad in defence, Broughton might struggle for opportunity next year. Injury-prone recruit Nick Malceski will turn 30 in August and has two years to run on a three-year deal. Gary Ablett is 31 but could play til he’s 40.\nGWS\nThe Giants wouldn’t be expecting any retirements at season’s end. Joel Patfull will be 31 in December but signed a two-year deal when he joined the club at the end of last year and looked good in defence before suffering broken ribs and a punctured lung.\nHAWTHORN\nThe Hawks have plenty of star players over 30 including Luke Hodge , Sam Mitchell , Josh Gibson and Shaun Burgoyne but the premiership quartet have already committed to playing on in 2016 by penning new deals. Full-back Brian Lake has expressed his desire to play on next year but the decision might be out of his hands following the addition of James Frawley and the presence of key tall Ryan Schoenmakers. David Hale might hang up the boots after two premierships and possibly a third as young ruckman Jonathon Ceglar steps up.\nMELBOURNE\nThere aren’t too many 30-plus players at the Demons following a third list rebuild under Paul Roos, but the end might be near for ruckman Mark Jamar (31) . The big Russian has been relegated to the VFL as Max Gawn and Jake Spencer assume the ruck duties. Former Bulldog Daniel Cross (32) signed a one-year deal last year to play on in 2015 and has shown his young teammates the hard work it takes to make it at AFL level. Has played every game this season and is averaging almost 22 disposals. If his body is willing, why wouldn’t he play on?\nDaniel Cross in action for the Demons. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia\nNORTH MELBOURNE\nBrent Harvey is 37, approaching his 400th game and is keen to play on next year . Scott McMahon (29) has been relegated to the VFL for most of the year, while fellow defender Nathan Grima has already retired due to injury . Jarrad Waite is 32 but signed a two-year deal to cross from Carlton at the end of last year and Daniel Wells (31 in February) and Drew Petrie (33 in October) still have at least a year left.\nPORT ADELAIDE\nTom Logan (30) is on the rookie list and hasn’t had a look in this season after playing just three senior games last year. He has been used to develop the club’s young defenders. Although he hasn’t reached the heights of last year so far, Jay Schulz (30) has kicked 27 goals and still has a lot to offer. Kane Cornes (32) has already announced his retirement.\nRICHMOND\nChris Newman , clearly the Tigers’ oldest player at 33, says he will make a decision at the end of the season about whether to go again in 2016. “I’m not really thinking about it too much, just trying to play my role for the team and stay in there for as long as possible,” he said two weeks ago. “We’ll see how the year pans out and I’ll make the decision.” Averaging 11 disposals a game and battling soft-tissue injuries, it might be hard to make a case for another year. Speaking of injuries, Nathan Foley has had yet another year destroyed by them. He will be 30 in a month and is out of contract at the end of the season. Ivan Maric and Troy Chaplin will turn 30 over summer but have a few years left.\nChris Newman is 33 and might call time on his career. Picture: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia\nST KILDA\nThe Saints have a hugely lopsided list with five players 31 or older, a bunch of hugely talented youngsters and not much in between. That makes for some head-scratchers for Alan Richardson and his list management team. All the older guys have given something this year, although it wouldn’t surprise if Sam Fisher , who just turned 33, calls it a day. Nick Riewoldt (32) and Leigh Montagna (31) are still flying — and “Joey” is contracted to the end of next year — Sean Dempster (31) is as solid as ever and Adam Schneider (31) is having his most productive season since 2011. He might get another year on the rookie list to mentor Jack Lonie and Co.\nSYDNEY SWANS\nThe Swans have five players over 30 but they’re all playing pretty good footy. Rhyce Shaw will be 34 in October and if the Swans manage to salute on first Saturday in October, you’d expect him to call it quits. Adam Goodes appeared to have gone on one year too long earlier this year but has now found form and hasn’t ruled out going on in 2016. Ted Richards (32) is still a premier defender and the Swans are a much better team when Mike Pyke (31) is playing. Ben McGlynn (30 in October) has had injury troubles but still has plenty to give while Sydney’s premiership window remains open.\nAdam Goodes hasn’t ruled out playing on in 2016. Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia\nWEST COAST\nFollowing the retirements of premiership heroes Darren Glass and Dean Cox last year and Beau Waters early this year, it’s unlikely the Eagles will have another retirement this year. The only remaining 2006 premiership player, Sam Butler will turn 30 in January and has battled injury over his career but coach Adam Simpson seems to have him pencilled in for a role down back. Matt Priddis has just turned 30 but you could see the Brownlow medallist playing on for at least 3-4 more years.\nWESTERN BULLDOGS\nA similar list profile to St Kilda, with four players 31 or older. Captain Bob Murphy (33) has already signed a one-year contract extension . Matthew Boyd (32) is out of contract at the end of the year but has resurrected his career playing across half-back . Dale Morris (32) is another on a one-year deal but he is one of the first picked to lead an inexperienced backline. Brett Goodes (31) has had a couple of career revivals but at 31 he probably won’t get another one.\n*Has already announced his retirement\nNote: All ages correct at time of publication\nOriginally published as Who might retire at your club?", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/443977-1fa1821a-2b77-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/444055-a4feefe2-2b77-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/441949-10b9c654-2b77-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/444086-06cd7234-2b78-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/443121-eb8deff4-2b76-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/444163-3b3942aa-2b78-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/end-of-the-line-which-afl-players-could-be-about-to-retire/story-fni5f22o-1227445444243", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/444003-5cb9fc90-2b77-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/444215-5f17b38c-2b78-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:24:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
