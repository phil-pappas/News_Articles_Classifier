They are waiting for the sun to set so they can safely come ashore and bury their eggs. But I won't see their amphibious landing, because like all humans, I must leave the island before dark.\nThis is the Galapagos, and I am merely an interloper, a party crasher. Yet, those minutes I spend on the silky beach, my toes submerged in water the color of blue topaz, are some of the most memorable in my life.\nIf you take one nature trip in a lifetime, let it be to the Galapagos Islands.\nMy college friend, Pamela Cohen, and I fly to the island of Baltra by way of Guayaquil, Ecuador, where we meet the crew of the Santa Cruz. A small panga, similar to a Zodiac rubber raft, motors us to our ship. (Our luggage is piled onto another one.) Modest by any standard, our small, two-story ship will be retired later this year and replaced with a more luxurious vessel.\nAlmost immediately, before our jet lag fades and our bodies adjust to the equatorial sun, we arrive at North Seymour Island. Now and throughout our eight-day excursion, we reach each island aboard the pangas. The itinerary lists \"wet landings.\" I soon learn this means slipping off the pangas into the chilled water a few feet from shore. Upon our arrival, we walk among imposing sea lions, fiery red crabs, marine iguanas, black frigate birds with bright red, balloon-like throat patches, and - my new screensaver - blue-footed boobies. Cartoonish in appearance, this brownish shore bird sports feet that are stunningly turquoise.\nA naturalist leads our group of 10 as we visit several islands in the archipelago, each having arisen from old (several millennia) or recent (500 years) volcanic eruptions, and now bearing unique terrains and wildlife, like brilliant orange flamingoes and majestic flightless cormorants.\nSnorkeling in the Galapagos requires an ability to swim well, but brings extraordinary rewards. Twice we swim from the rocky shore, but most of the time we simply slide off the panga into deep water as clear as glass and teeming with penguins, sea turtles, sea lions and neon-colored fish. We swim so close to these amazing creatures, we often cannot avoid touching them.\nWe know of the Galapagos through Charles Darwin, whose visit there ultimately nurtured his theory of evolution. We can imagine his inaugural view of the volcanoes, finches, and craters that now bear his name.\nOn Santa Cruz Island, home of the Charles Darwin Research Station, we find the piece de resistance, giant tortoises, not quite the size of a Smart car, but close. They roam here in fields of green that contrast to the other islands, darkened by lava flow or blanketed by bleached sands. As we approach them, close enough to touch, they begin their unhurried crawl away.\nI have no doubt that repeated visits to the Galapagos will continually enthrall. Unlike tourist attractions such as Piccadilly Circus or the Colosseum, this one promises to be different every time you go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T07:11:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
