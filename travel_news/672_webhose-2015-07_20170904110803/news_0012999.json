She considers herself a consensus-builder, but was unable to provide a substantive example of her record at a meeting with The Seattle Times editorial board. She also came across as complacent about past board dysfunction and the need to improve district and board communication with families.\nEsparza ran against McLaren in the last election for District 6. He has strong views on school finance and reducing testing, but lacks the leadership experience and skills to show he could be an effective board director.\nHarris, who may come across as abrasive in her critiques of board policies and decisions, will need to demonstrate her ability to collaborate with other board members and find solutions — not just problems.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A. Blethen, Ryan Blethen, Brier Dudley, Mark Higgins, Jonathan Martin, Thanh Tan, Blanca Torres, William K. Blethen (emeritus) and Robert C.
