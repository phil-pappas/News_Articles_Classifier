Frontier Airlines is increasing the width of the middle seat by an inch on its Airbus A320 and A319 planes. The seats are growing to 19.3 inches, while window and aisle seats on the planes are 18.1 inches wide. Some of the company’s planes including the change are already in service, while others will be updated by the end of the year. Still, wider middle seats are being countered with thinner seats in the planes overall that are pre-reclined so the airline can add up to 12 new seats per plane. The changes make the space from a point on one seat to the same point on the one in front of it 28 inches. Passengers who want more space can purchase Stretch Seating tickets to add 5 to 7 inches of extra legroom. Low-cost carriers like Frontier and Allegiant Airlines increasing flights have been responsible for a significant drop in average fares at the Cincinnati airport. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the airport dropped to No. 3 on airfare rankings of the nation's 100 largest airports. The local airport has traditionally topped the list with the most expensive fares in the nation. \nWant Cincinnati Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
