You'll find the whole range of topics on French travel here. \nIf you're a city person, you'll probably start your travels in Paris --and you should. If you're visiting London, a popular way to visit Paris is to take the \"chunnel train\" called Eurostar . You can check prices by using Rail Europe's Eurostar Booking Center (book direct). \nBesides being one of Europe's Best Cities to visit, there are several day trips from Paris featuring some great buildings, from the palace at Versailles to the famous Gothic cathedral at Chartres . \nSpeaking of the great Gothic cathedrals of France, the cathedral at Amiens is the largest of the three, and visitors to the town can walk the old tow path along the river to see the famous floating gardens that have supplied the city with flowers and vegetables since medieval times. \nWith high speed trains from Paris common these days, a trip to World Heritage Site Avignon in southern Provence can be done in a little over two and a half hours. If you're a wine lover, the Cotes du Rhone is a hop, skip and a jump away. \nIn the heat of summer, the north of France isn't a bad place to be. Mont St. Michel awaits your visit. \nInterested in castles and walled cities? Don't miss Carcassonne , one of the larger cities in the Aude Departement of the Languedoc region, commonly known as \"Cathar Country\", where the religious sect known as the Cathars retreated to remote castles to avoid religious persecution. See our Aude Map to learn more.
