The meeting was attended by 40 people in total and addressed key issues facing the Praslin economy. \nThe Fair Trading Commission has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCI) to share information on cases concerning abuse, manipulation, and fraud upon the free market system. \nThe issues discussed focus first on the monopoly practice in place on the Mahe-Praslin ferry route. This route has a price scheme that is unregulated, and route schedule is unregulated as well. \nThe FTC collected information to further its investigation. \nThe second area of discussion was the destination management companyâ€™s (DMC) control over Praslin under its current business model. Members asserted that this was in fact a monopoly in play with DMC now in the hotel business, excursion business, restaurant, transfer, and even bicycle business. The Fair Trading Commission (FTC) advised that they are aware of the problem and are perusing the matter aggressively given that Praslin has the largest amount of boat excursion charters in all of Seychelles. \nThe third issue discussed was the trans-shipment of perishables to be dumped on Praslin such as bread. This practice must stop, and the SCCI asked the government to take the necessary steps to cease this practice. \nThe fourth issue focused on cargo trading. There is 1,000 tons of capacity and only 90 tons of demand per day. Contractors must have their cargo license restricted to their own business, and must not be permitted to ship third-party cargo in order to protect the investments of dry-cargo shippers. \nThe fifth issue discussed was the cartel on cement sales which many believe involve Investment Promotion Act (IPA) tax-free cement. This is a fraud, and the FTC must take action. \nThe next meeting will take place in August as the matters discussed are urgent. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
