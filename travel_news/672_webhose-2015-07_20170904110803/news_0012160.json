(Hence), we are providing comfortable napping areas where passengers can take a power nap, and private Honeycomb seats where people can work,” he said. \n\nThe new lounge introduces live cooking stations, where guests can watch chefs prepare local dishes such as laksa and chicken rice. \n\nWhile the independent lounge is popular with corporate and airline clients, it remains a new concept to much of the travelling population, as they are unaware the lounge is open to all, Song said. \n\nHowever, this is not stopping Plaza Premium from embarking on a rapid worldwide expansion. \n\nAs part of a US$40 million global development plan, the new Singapore lounge joins the newly opened lounge at London Heathrow Terminal 4, as well as upcoming openings in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Salalah in Oman. \n\nPlaza Premium is also opening an airport transit hotel in Terminal 1 of Changi Airport. Due mid-September, the resort-themed hotel will have more than 60 rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:37:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
