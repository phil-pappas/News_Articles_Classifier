Even their shallow rivers run quiet and smooth. \nAnd that’s why the kids get tanked. \nAt night they’d wander out into grazing pastures, dump the water out of the large, round, metal cattle watering tanks and roll them down to the edge of a meandering river. Then a half dozen or so would get in a tank or two and they would have splash fights, or cruise for miles along the slow, shallow rivers. \nOne night a rancher caught them and thought, “Ingenious kids.” \nToday, thousands of vacationers across Canada and the U.S. head for western Nebraska each summer to get tanked too. There are dozens of outfitters across western Nebraska – such as the Sandhills Motel and Glidden Canoe Rental – conducting escorted tank floats, particularly on the Middle Loup River . \nOutfitters upgraded the midnight teenagers’ version, by installing wire benches. Everybody gets a paddle, although it’s used more for splashing fellow tankers than navigating. \nThe Middle Loup River moves at a leisurely, but steady flow through the Sandhills and open prairie. \nThe Middle Loup and neighbouring rivers are fed by the Ogallala Aquifer – one of the world’s largest. It’s an underground lake covering 450,000 square kilometres. That’s one reason Nebraska has more rivers than any other U.S. State. \nThe Sandhills dunes and grasslands are designated a National Nature Landmark . \nTanking along the Middle Loup is somewhat like riding a bumper car. You’ll collide with tree stumps, rocks, little islands, river banks, and of course, other tanks.The round tanks merely roll with the punches and keep on cruising. \nThere’s no danger. Everybody has a life jacket, but you can always walk to shore. At times you’ll see wildlife watching your party laugh and splash its way down stream; sometimes horses, sometimes coyotes. \nThere are a couple of branches of the Loup River, (the French word for wolf). French fur trappers named the rivers after the Skidi band of the Pawnee Nation, known as the wolf people. \nIf getting tanked is a little too tame for your tastes, there are other rivers in the area with white water challenges. Sandhills Motel and Glidden Canoe Rental have all the equipment you’ll need. All excursions start at the Sandhills Motel and head out bouncing across the Sandhills in an old school bus to where your tank awaits. \nAfter their river run, many visitors go visit the home of America’s first superstar. \nBuffalo Bill Cody was a Pony Express rider at 14, a Union scout through much of the American Civil and the most productive supplier of buffalo meat to the railways and their huge crews of men pushing the railways west. \nEventually he founded Buffalo Bill’s Wild West, a circus-like travelling entertainment show that grew to great acclaim and toured throughout the United States, Great Britain and Europe. \nHe created a 4,000-acre ranch near North Platte to train his performers and to winter his show animals. The ranch is open to the public today where you can watch your dinner cooked in and around a prairie chuckwagon. \nMany of Buffalo Bill Cody’s garish outfits, his fancy guns and historic artifacts from fellow sharp-shooters Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane are on display in his wedding-cake-style mansion, designed by his sister, Julia Goodman. \nSitting atop one of the world’s largest aquifer is also the world’s largest railway assembly yard. \nAbout 139 trains with 14,000 railways cars roll into Union Pacific`s 2,850-acre Bailey Yard each day to be dismantled and reassembled as a new train. All of Union Pacific’s trains across America head for the North Platte assembly yard and then roll out in an east, west, north or south direction from there. \nUnion Pacific knows how much the public likes to watch trains do their thing, so they built an eight-storey observation tower where you eat snacks and watch trains being put together on 200 different tracks. \nThe locomotive fueling and maintenance center at the yard works on 8,500 locomotives per month. \nIF YOU GO \n– Bailey Yard: goldenspiketower.com .– Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park: sandhillsmotel.com . © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.
