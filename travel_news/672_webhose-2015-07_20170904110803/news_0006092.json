Requires iOS8 or later.\nCost: $1.99.\nWhat it does: Tells you exactly when a photographer’s coveted “morning magic hour” — sunrise — and “evening magic hour” — sunset — will occur at a specified destination around the world.\nWhat’s hot: I’m an amateur photographer, so I know that the soft light at sunset and sunrise is best for taking photos. The attractive and easy-to-use Lumy app lets you set a calendar for your location and date and enables notifications alerting you to when the golden hours occur. It also gives you a heads up about the weather for even better planning. If you’re ready to step up your photography skills, you can double-tap the main screen and get seven more photo-centric times, such as morning astronomical twilight or evening nautical twilight, to name two. My favorite part? You can access the information offline.\nWhat’s not: I accidentally missed a “morning magic hour” in Rome because it was too easy to sleep through the 4:30 a.m. notification. For me, the information is incredibly useful, but I need to set an alarm. If I had one request for the developer, it would be a community home where Lumy app users could share their photos.\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-07-24T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:37:19.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
