The dedicated week, running from 5 to 9 October, is designed to highlight the advantages of developing breakfast meeting packages to venues throughout London and inspire them to explore the abundance of opportunities this may bring, allowing them to take more bookings and build their business. \nBreakfast meetings often remain an untapped resource when it comes to increasing bookings, and following on from the success of last year’s event London Breakfast Meetings Week will help to show venues how this opportunity can be exploited. Throughout the week, events will be led by The Deck at the National Theatre. They will be unveiling critical research, running breakfast themed activities and initiating forward-thinking ideas all with the aim of uniting London venues to consider breakfast meetings as a practical option to increase bookings in the long term. Charley Taylor-Smith, head of hospitality events and commercial business development at The Deck, said on the return of the event: ‘We are excited to be relaunching London Breakfast Meetings Week for 2015 and look forward to collaborating with our fellow London venues to rethink and reinterpret the idea of not only breakfast, but meetings in general. The week is gearing up to be a fantastic focal point for the events industry and brings with it a sense of unity among London venues with a shared goal of growth.’ Any venues wishing to get involved with London Breakfast Meetings Week will be able to access a dedicated toolkit created by The Deck, which will help venues develop their own breakfast events and join in with the week’s activities.
