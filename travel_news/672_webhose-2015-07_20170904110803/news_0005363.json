The Sindbad app is an addition to the existing Oman Air mobile app and comes packed with features to provide a more seamless travel experience for guests. The app enables members to check their Sindbad miles balance, claim any missing miles, request for redemptions, keep track of their Tier progress, see their upcoming bookings on Oman Air, check their Family account, and much more directly from their mobile phones. \nMembers can also store and display their Sindbad membership card on their mobile app and use it to get their privileges and benefits at the airport, all from the palm of their hand. Customers who are not yet members of Sindbad can now enroll via the app and start earning miles right away. Mohammed Al Shikely, General Manager Marketing for Oman Air, comments: “With this enhanced Sindbad mobile app from Oman Air, members can not only search, book, buy and check-in for their flights, but they can also manage their Sindbad membership all on the go. The app is free of charge and is available for download at the Apple app store and on Google play. “This great innovation is the latest in a series of digital developments at Oman Air which offer even greater convenience for our customers. Since becoming the first airline in the world to offer both mobile phone and wi-fi connectivity whilst in-flight, we have redesigned our website to offer more information and more customer friendly. We have made it available in both English and Arabic, and have added functionalities that include our ‘Manage booking’ feature. Earlier this year, we also launched our Oman Air mobile app, which is now enhanced with the addition of our Sindbad app. “As Oman Air continues to expand and attract international acclaim for the quality of our products and services, our award-winning digital presence is also ensuring that we are more accessible and responsive to the needs of our customers. We look forward to announcing more great digital products in the future.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:29:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
