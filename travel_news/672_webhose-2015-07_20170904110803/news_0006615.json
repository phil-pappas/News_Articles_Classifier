Phase 1 will connect the San Francisco Bay Area to the Los Angeles Basin in less than three hours at speeds of over 300kph. The system will eventually extend to Sacramento and San Diego, totalling some 1200km in network length with up to 24 stations.\nNetwork Rail has a strong pedigree in planning, designing, operating and maintaining state-of-the-art high-speed railway infrastructure. The company currently operates and maintains Britain’s high-speed railway, HS1, connecting London with the Channel Tunnel and providing both domestic and international high speed services. Network Rail is also closely involved in developing Britain’s second high speed railway, HS2, from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.\nDrawing on this experience, Network Rail Consulting will provide specialist advisory services to the Authority, primarily in operations and maintenance, leading up to the start of revenue service.\nNigel Ash, managing director of Network Rail Consulting, said: “I am delighted that Network Rail Consulting is a major part of the winning consultancy team for this prestigious contract. This proves that we can compete successfully against strong US and international companies.\n“One of our goals when we launched Network Rail Consulting in 2012 was to export British rail expertise around the world and be an ambassador for Britain’s rail industry. This long term contract firmly establishes us in the United States and will help channel innovation back into Network Rail’s core business.\nPatrick Butcher, chairman of Network Rail Consulting and Network Rail group finance director, said: “The confidence placed in Network Rail by the California High Speed Rail Authority shows that the skills and expertise of Network Rail people are valued around the globe, which is good for Network Rail and good for Britain.”\nGary Griggs, Parsons Brinckerhoff programme director, said: “I am delighted to have Network Rail Consulting as a key member of our team. Their skills and experience in operating high speed rail infrastructure will be invaluable to our delivering a successful network.”\nIn February 2015, Network Rail Consulting announced it had been selected as part of a consortium to deliver the North South Railway project in Saudi Arabia, worth £120m over five years. In June 2014, Transport for New South Wales appointed Network Rail Consulting to assist with a major upgrade of Sydney’s rail network.\nSource:- Network Rail\nRelated Posts Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Network Rail completes £200m festive upgrade programme Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:12:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
