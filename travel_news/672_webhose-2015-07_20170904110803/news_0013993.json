He did say that cleanup efforts would include both damage repairs and preventive measures for communities facing similar situations in the future.\nFirmamos la Declaratoria de Emergencia Nacional que nos permitirá iniciar la tercera fase de reconstrucción\n— Luis Guillermo Solís (@luisguillermosr) June 30, 2015\nOn Monday night, Solís had ruled out issuing the decree, saying at a press conference, “at this moment there are not enough reasons to allocate more financial resources.” But after his weekly Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the president changed course and announced he had signed the emergency decree after receiving a full report from ministers and other Cabinet members.\nPublic Works and Transport ( MOPT ) Vice Minister Mauricio González at the Tuesday meeting reported that the two main routes to the Caribbean province of Limón have been reopened. MOPT crews reopened passage on Route 32 from San José to the Caribbean and Route 10 from Cartago at about 8:30 a.m, he said.\nPassage on Route 126, which connects Limón through the Heredia canton of Sarapiquí is also open, except for buses, semi-trailers and trucks.\nNational Emergency Commission (CNE) officials maintain a maximum alert, or Red Alert, for eight cantons in the provinces of Limón, Heredia and Cartago, as heavy rains and floods continue to persist from the weekend.\nSolís said the government spent ₡183 million ($338,000) on emergency response, evacuation of affected residents, food, supplies and repairs to public infrastructure.\nThe president said he would continue ongoing surveys of damage in the Caribbean region on Wednesday and Thursday in order to evaluate progress.\nA CNE report on Tuesday morning states that 18 communities in Limón, Heredia and Cartago remain isolated by flooding. Rains in these cantons so far have damaged 1,585 homes, 18 schools, 23 roads, 11 bridges and eight aqueducts.\nEmergency agencies currently have eight shelters open where they are attending 650 people evacuated from their homes.\nMeteorologist Juan Carlos Fallas from the National Meteorological Institute at noon on Tuesday said a tropical wave that entered the country on Monday night had caused showers that lasted most of the night and into the morning on Tuesday, mostly in the Heredia canton of Sarapiquí and in some areas of the Pacific province of Puntarenas.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/luisguillermosr/status/615962006600986624"], "published": "2015-07-01T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:51:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
