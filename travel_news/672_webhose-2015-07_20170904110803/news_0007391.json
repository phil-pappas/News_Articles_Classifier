Minister St.Ange was being accompanied on this visit by the Principal Secretary for Tourism, Anne Lafortune, and the Chief Executive of the Seychelles Tourism Board, Sherin Naiken. \nThis visit forms part of the series of door-to-door visits to licensed tourism establishments across the country. \nThe six hotels on Cerf island are L'Habitation des Cerfs, Fairy Tern, Villa de Cerf, Tropical Sanctuary Cerf Island Seychelles, Cerf Island Resort, and South Point Villa. \nMinister St.Ange and his tourism delegation have already visited licensed establishments on Praslin, Silhouette, Fregate, and several tourism establishments in the northern and western part of Mahe. \n“It is pleasing to see that the inhabitants and hoteliers on Cerf island have understood the call that the government has made for Seychellois to claim back their tourism industry,” Minister St.Ange said. \n“I am happy to see that the six hotels on this island are working well and that the hoteliers on Cerf island have even joined together to form a small group to take up their challenges and find solutions together,” the Minister said. \nMinister Alain St.Ange added that the difference on Cerf island is that there are only Seychellois-owned hotels, and this falls in line with the government’s decision to bring more Seychellois into the country’s tourism industry. \nMinister St.Ange has also held talks with the owners, management, and staff of these hotels to understand the challenges they face. \nSome of the constraints put to the minister’s attention were ongoing shortage staff that is today creating real problems to the country's tourism industry, coastal erosion, and the problem of accumulated seaweeds on the beach which have become a breeding ground for sun flies. \nOther concerns brought forward included the jet skis speeding in the marine park and becoming a nuisance to those snorkeling around the island, and the continued use of fish traps by some people in the park itself. \nMinister St.Ange said these points will be taken up with the concerned authorities. \nHe added that Cerf island provides tranquility, and the hotels are perfect to for those wanting the Seychelles experience. \n\"I was also amazed to find out that domestic tourism is on the increase on Cerf island, and it is something that we must encourage,\" the Minister added. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
