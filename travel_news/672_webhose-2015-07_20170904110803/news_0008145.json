It's one of Great Britain's quintessential sports – but despite a reputation as a pastime for pensioners, lawn bowls is much more than elderly men and women in white uniforms. Chess with balls; curling without the ice; a slow, methodical, thoughtful, stuffy, almost sedate game played in members-only clubs by people too old to try their hand at more energetic, edgy sports. Lawn bowls may seem as rock’n’roll as Coldplay and quinoa – but the public's perception of this emblematic British game may soon change. In May, more than 150 students and young professionals attended the inaugural casual lawn bowls tournament held by Barefoot Bowls in Finsbury Square, central London. Half of Britain's bowling greens are under threat from property developers and cost-cutting councils The organisers hope it will become a springboard for a more youthful nationwide appreciation of bowls – combining the sport with a pub culture element often seen with darts, pool, foosball and, increasingly, table tennis. The older generation is not complaining: half of Britain's 5,000 bowling greens are under threat from property developers and cost-cutting councils, so movements such as Barefoot Bowls may have a similar positive impact as footgolf has for many struggling golf clubs. A relaxed, shoeless form of lawn bowls is not entirely new. Australia has had a love affair with barefoot bowls for the past decade, resulting in the country's 2,000 clubs relaxing their rules on membership and dress code to appeal to a new generation. So, what is lawn bowls – and how hard is it to play? Well, the main attraction is its accessibility and, well, “pickupability”. Each player had four weighted bowls – or woods – that are heavier on one side, giving them a bias. The objective is to roll these bowls along a flat grass bowling green, approximately 110-130ft (34-40m) long, towards a smaller ball, or jack. Points are scored for the bowls closest to the jack. The game can be traced back to the 13th century and relies on a mix of precision, patience and, at times, power (when performing a drive to knock an opponent's bowl clear of the jack). It can actually get nerve-shreddingly tense – and it is also fairly addictive and competitive. There are said to be more than 400,000 bowlers in England, while Scotland has nearly 100,000. The annual world championships usually pulls in around three million spectators on TV and no one is said to be more than 15 miles away from their nearest bowling ground, where membership is often as little as £70 and one-off game fees are becoming increasingly the norm. If you are playing barefoot, just be careful where you drop those bowls All in all, there is no excuse for you not to give it a go. In fact, why not take the children too? Bowls England is a good place to get started if you are interested in the sport – and you can find out where your nearest club is here . If the weather is not great or you are put off by the cold then the British Isles Indoor Bowls Council website has all you need to know about playing indoors. And if you are still not convinced by lawn bowls' ability to enthral then there is a slightly different version of the game called crown green bowls that is played on an uneven green, which should provide the necessary curveball to send excitement levels soaring. A little advice to beginners of all ages: if you are flouting the ancient traditions and playing barefoot, just be careful where you drop those bowls. Weighing in well above a kilogram, they are about as heavy as three tins of baked beans.
