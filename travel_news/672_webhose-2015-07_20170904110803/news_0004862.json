It’s made from materials that include varying densities of wood including lightweight bamboo and paulownia, and heavier ash and beech, synthetics such as lightweight polyurethane foam and strengthening fibreglass, and reinforcing sheets of metals such as titanium or titanal (a light, strong aluminium alloy). More unusual materials might include rubbery inserts, electric fibres, honeycomb structures, varying forms of carbon or fibres derived from rock. In general, lighter materials help make skis lively and flexible. Denser ones make them heavier but stable, and dampen vibrations for a smoother ride. Sidewalls If there are walls at the sides of skis, between the metal edges and the protective topsheet, it’s called sidewall construction. Sidewalls add strength to skis and help grip and stability, while also protecting the core. • Hike & ride ski test winners Cap/partial cap/hybrid cap In cap construction the skis’ protective topsheet stretches all the way to their edges and there are no sidewalls. Cap skis tend to be more forgiving than those with sidewalls, and easier to turn. Some skis have a partial cap construction, where the topsheet curves part way towards the edges, and then there’s a small sidewall below to add grip. Hybrid cap skis may have sidewalls under the bindings for grip, and cap construction at tip and tails. Dampening Many skis, especially those for carving high-speed turns like piste expert skis, have some sort of structure mounted on the topsheet to absorb unwanted vibrations. This is called dampening, and increases the stability of skis at high speed. The challenge for manufacturers is to do this without making the skis so \"damp\" that they lose their springy rebound at the exit of each turn. • On-piste ski test winners Flex Some skis are designed to be easier to bend, both along their length and torsionally (twisting from side to side). Soft flexing models are easier to turn while stiffer ones offer more stability, especially at speed, and for heavier skiers. Sidecut This refers to how curvy or straight the sides of skis are. Old school skis were almost straight up and down; all types of modern skis tend to have narrower waists than tips, giving them curvier, hourglass shapes. In general, this makes them easier to turn, especially on piste, however a very deep sidecut means less stability at speed. On-piste skis have the narrowest waists for better grip, while skis with wider waists (and less difference between waist and tips) have extra float, making it easier to tackle variable, off-piste terrain. In our ski reviews, sidecut is defined by ski width at tip, waist and tail, expressed in millimetres (eg 122/80/110), alongside the length of the skis it refers to in centimetres (eg 170). • All-mountain ski test winners Radius This governs the size of turn skis would naturally make when tipped on edge without pressure. The radius of curvy-sidecut slalom skis might be 12m, and can be as big as 44m for straighter sided, fatter big-mountain skis. Some skis are multi-radius, meaning the natural turn size changes along their length (often big at the front for ease of starting turns, tight at the rear for ease of finishing them). That’s why skis in our reviews may have two or more radius figures. Rocker Traditionally, skis are raised off the ground in the middle (see ‘Traditional camber’ below). In its simplest terms, rocker means that if laid flat the centre of a ski touches the slope while the tip and tail curve up more than usual. This makes turning in powder easier, so most all-mountain, freeride and big mountain skis have some form of rocker. The downside of rocker is that it can detract from grip and stability on piste, so to make on-/off-piste performance more balanced, skis may have partial rocker – just at tip and tail for example, with a more traditional construction in the middle for improved grip. Even park & pipe skis may have some rocker, to help with pivoting and buttering. • Freeride ski test winners Traditional camber The opposite of rocker. Tips and tails make contact with the ground when skis are laid on a flat surface, and there’s a gap under their centre. This shape can make it easier to transfer weight to the tips and tails, helping with grip. A bigger gap under the centre also makes skis livelier. Most on-piste skis have traditional camber (sometimes with ‘Tip rocker’ – see below). Park & pipe skis tend to have traditional camber to maximise pop. Tip rocker Some on-piste skis have a little rocker, usually at the tips only. Although rocker is generally used to help with float off piste, tip rocker can also help with starting turns on groomed snow. Reverse sidecut Some powder skis with rocker get wider instead of narrower from the tips back towards the middle of the shovel, before narrowing again towards the waist, to help with float. The same may apply at the tail. Termed reverse sidecut, it’s intended to increase float in powder. This can mean there are four or five width measurements for sidecut in our ski reviews, instead of three. • Big mountain ski test winners Mounting point Skis have a recommended mounting point for bindings - most are mounted slightly back of centre. Generally, the further forward bindings are, the easier skis are to pivot (on snow and in the air) and the more playful they feel. The disadvantage is that the tips tend to submarine in deep snow, and the skis tend to be less stable in long, fast turns. When buying bindings separately from skis, sometimes there’s a choice of mounting points, so you can specify the one that suits your skiing style. Even with integrated bindings, there’s sometimes an option to move the binding toepiece forwards or backwards to adjust stance on the ski. • Park & pipe ski test winners Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:51:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
