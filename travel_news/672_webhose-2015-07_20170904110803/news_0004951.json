Secondly you wonder where you will put up, unless it is a trip that needs to last only a few hours and is not too distant from your home. \nThose who need to be on the road frequently understand the value of a home-like feel when you check in at the end of a tiring day. Whether it is your job which has brought you to a place or whether you are vacationing alone or with your loved ones, you want to put up at the kind of place which feels cozy and homey. Comfort and convenience are the twin blocks on which a stay will prove memorable or become a horrid memory. \nWhere Coziness and Luxury Meet \nWhen you check into a Big Lake, Texas motel like the Republic, you have convenience, comfort and that indefinable feel of a home away from home. It is a place unlike any other in Big Lake as each room has a kitchenette, microwave, fridge, and large 42 inch HDTV’s with free Dish TV and HBO. Don’t underestimate the value of the kitchenette as you can save big on food and drinks if you keep your rations in the fridge. Even if you bring in something from outside and it is more than you can wrap up at one go, just shove it into the fridge and microwave it the next day to finish it. Remember the old adage, “Waste not, and want not”? \nIt also gives you the liberty to eat what you want to, rather than be limited by the menu of the room service. Further, suppose you come in too late from work or sightseeing to order something from an eatery, you need not starve if you had the foresight to stock your fridge with some foodstuffs. Motels are meant to provide accommodation at an affordable price, because it is not possible for everyone to afford hotels that are costly. Beside the obvious work needs, a business traveler values a clean and comfortable motel room. \nHotels Are a Better Option for Fussy Travelers \nIf you are a fussy traveler, you can try the Big Lake, Texas hotel run by Republic for sheer luxury if your budget allows it. Each of its rooms contains two comfortable and luxurious beds and top of the line mattresses. They don’t accept travel coupons but that shouldn’t be such a deterrent as most coupon users know that coupons have an unnerving tendency to expire just a few days before you actually need them. Check beforehand whether you will get a full refund in case you need to cancel your booking due to some unforeseen circumstance or mishap. Find out whether there any cancellation charges which will be deducted. Source: Free Articles   ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nThe Republic Hotel is the newest facility in Big Lake, Texas.
