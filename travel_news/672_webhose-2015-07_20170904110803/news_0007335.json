Arthur and Lyn Dobrin. \nA perfect place for a romantic getaway on Long Island’s East End, the boutique-like Hotel Indigo is located where Long Island splits into the South Fork, noted for the Hamptons; and the North Fork, the center of Long Island wine country . Both destinations are less than a twenty-minute drive from the hotel. \nGuests might never know that the two-story, 100 room Hotel Indigo is just yards from the end of the Long Island Expressway and abuts the massive Tanger Outlet Center , as the artful landscaping provides beauty and quiet. As one guest, who has spent summers in Italy , marveled, “I feel as though I am in Tuscany.” \nAlthough the famous Hamptons are easily accessible from the Hotel Indigo, most guests choose the destination for the wine country. More than a quarter of the hotel’s guests are European (Italians, French and Germans) who spend part of their vacation in New York City , then come east for several days exploring the wineries that begin as close as two miles away. \nHotel Indigo is inviting and pet friendly . Comfortable chairs and sofas decorate the lobby, which opens to the bar and dining rooms as well as ample seating around an outdoor fireplace. Even in colder weather there is outdoor food service under heat lamps. Wi-fi throughout the property makes the business center superfluous. \nGuest Rooms at Hotel Indigo Rooms at Hotel Indigo are on the small side. The beige, brown and white color pattern of the public spaces is carried into the rooms. Rooms have a TV, room safe and Keurig coffee brewer. While the rooms on the west side of the hotel have a better view (facing the pool), rooms on the east side, which face the parking lot, are quieter. \nDining at Hotel Indigo Bistro 72 (named for the last exit on the Long Island Expressway) is Indigo’s restaurant where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served. The dining experience is comfortable, relaxed and tasty. Bistro 72 uses locally sourced ingredients. Dinner options included a clam chowder made from South Shore clams; local steamed mussels; and Long Island duck . Lots of Long Island-grown vegetables find their way onto the menu. Vegan options were individual flatbread pizza with local marinated vegetables and a wrap of local vegetables with hummus and organic mesclun greens. \nSince this is wine country, the list features many Long Island selections. Our flight of local whites included wines from Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard , Lieb Cellars , Palmer Vineyards and Osprey’s Dominion Vineyards . The reds started with Castello di Borghese Fleurette 2009 and ended with Bedell Cellars' Cabernet Franc 2011. \nDestination Weddings at Hotel Indigo Indigo hosts one wedding at a time. The ballroom, located on the lower level, can accommodate up to 240 guests. The large square room is equipped with special lighting that can be changed to complement the color scheme of the wedding or fit the mood with the music. Outdoor tented space is available as well. On-site wedding planners and their catering team help customize the event and can arrange beach excursions, wine tours and spa treatments for the couple and their guests. \nHoneymoons/Romance Packages at Hotel Indigo Indigo offers two packages that are appealing to couples: East End Couples Retreat and The North For Uncorked. The couples retreat includes a 60-minute couples massage and a $50 food and beverage credit at Bistro 72. North Fork Uncorked is a private wine and spirits tour with transportation to three vineyards for tastings. \nActivities at Hotel Indigo Several private seating areas around a large saltwater pool make for a somewhat private setting. Poolside rooms have Adirondack chairs on the patios. Care to settle in and read a book? In a library nook are multiple copies of new books. We picked up a fresh copy of The Great Gatsby there. \nThe Indigo spa offers deep tissue, hot stone and full body massages as well as couples’ massages. There is a small fitness center. \nNearby Hotel Indigo Guests stay at Hotel Indigo because of its proximity to Long Island’s attractive East End. The North Fork is agricultural country, with wide-open fields of vegetables and fruit trees. The main attraction here is the vineyards with over 50 wine producers, most offering tours and tastings. \nA picnic at a vineyard or a wine tasting is a romantic way to spend an afternoon. Our personal favorite is Macari Vineyards in nearby Mattituck, opened in 1995 and devoted to not only producing good wine but also sustainable stewardship of the land. While sampling wine in its beautiful tasting room, you may be lucky enough to see a blue heron or eagle, or perhaps a red fox. \nThe South Fork is all about the beach, wealth and people-watching. A note about the beaches: many are private and those that are public require passes issued by local municipalities, thereby making most off-limits to short-term visitors. \nThe Parrish Art Museum in Southampton focuses on Long Island painters such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning . \nThere are three public golf courses within two miles of Hotel Indigo. And canoes and kayaks can be rented from Peconic Paddler, about a mile away, for a lazy trip up the Peconic River through Long Island Pine Barrens. \nSeveral first-class restaurants are within ten minutes drive of Hotel Indigo and right in town we enjoyed the Riverhead Project, located in a former bank building. Every Thursday, the chef prepares a special four-course meal and diners can sit at a special table in the kitchen to watch her cook. For breakfast and lunch, try the never-changed 1930s Riverhead Grill, a favorite diner for locals. Tweed’s, which has been restored to its original 1896 splendor, specializes in bison and local produce. \nThe simplest pleasures are a stroll along the Peconic riverfront to watch men cast their fishing lines while swans paddle by or a stop at a farm stand. \nA concierge is in the lobby to help map out trips. If you are without a car, the hotel can arrange trips for you to the Hamptons or the wineries or, if you prefer, you can use the car rental facility located in the lobby. \nPros/Cons at Hotel Indigo Rooms on the west side of the hotel face the pool and outdoor dining area. If the revelry lasts late into the night, sleep can be disturbed. \nHotel Indigo Vibe There is so much to do in the area that Hotel Indigo attracts a wide variety of guests of all ages. It is especially attractive to Long Islanders seeing a relaxing and fun weekend away without have the hassle of long drives and airports. \nHotel Indigo 1830 West Main Street, Route 25Riverhead, NY 11901", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T03:04:28.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
