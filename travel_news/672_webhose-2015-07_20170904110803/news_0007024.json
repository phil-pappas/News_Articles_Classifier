Brewer III said 50 Cent and his legal team are “disappointed in the verdict but very appreciative of the service of the jury and the court.” Leviston’s lawyer, Philip Freidin, declined to comment on the award, first reported by the New York Daily News .\nRapper Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson will hope the movie Southpaw packs a punch after being ordered to pay at least $5 million to a woman who was in a sex tape she added crude commentary to and put online.

The character made explicit remarks about Leviston and taunted rap rival Rick Ross , who wasn’t in the video but has a daughter with Leviston. At the time the video surfaced, Ross and 50 Cent were trading barbs via video, lyrics and interviews.\n50 Cent got the 2008 tape from the man in it, Leviston’s boyfriend at the time. The rapper and his lawyers said that 50 Cent didn’t actually post the video but that Leviston’s then-boyfriend said she wouldn’t mind if he did, and he thought that would suffice.\nThe Pimpin’ Curly character was just “joking” by referring to Leviston as a “porn star,” 50 Cent said during sworn pre-trial questioning that was played for the jury, according to news reports. He didn’t testify at the trial.\n50 Cent’s rival, rapper Rick Ross, was taunted in the sex tape featuring the women who gave birth to his child.

I didn’t have a choice. I would never, ever do this to myself,” she testified, according to news reports.\nBorn Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent burst to the fore of gangsta rap with 2003’s ‘Get Rich or Die Tryin,’ its lead single, ‘In Da Club,’ and a tough life story that included being shot nine times.\nNow 40, he’s also a businessman — his interests have ranged from mining to water drinks — and an actor whose credits include the Starz network action series Power and the upcoming boxing movie Southpaw .\nCELEBRITY SEX TAPES\nOriginally published as How 50 cents turned into $5 million", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/50cent?lang=en", "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/50-cent-ordered-pay-6m-online-sex-tape-case-article-1.2288371", "http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/rapper-and-actor-50-cent-ordered-to-pay-5-million-to-woman-in-a-sex-tape-he-posted-online/story-fnjwnhzf-1227438099455", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/101556-fe62cfbc-2790-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Ross", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227438/101504-768df618-2789-11e5-8211-05d592ef4ee0.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-11T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T13:34:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
