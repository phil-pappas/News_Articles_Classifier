Article By: Megan Ellis Thu, 23 Jul 2015 8:22 AM Share Hotel Verde. Image supplied. \nThe world's greenest hotel may just be located within our borders, right in Cape Town. \nThis is because the Hotel Verde, Cape Town Airport has become the first hotel to ever receive a second LEED Platinum Green Building Certification from the United States Green Building Council (USGBC). \nOften hailed as the greenest hotel in Africa, Hotel Verde may now have the title of greenest hotel in the world. \nIt is the first hotel globally to achieve a double Platinum certification for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). \nThe four-star hotel already had a Platinum certification for New Construction in the Green Building Design and Construction category, which it was awarded in May 2014. \nIt now also has a Platinum certification in Existing Building Operations & Maintenance. \nThe hotel has moved from an LEED score of 85 to 89 with the recent certification. \nIn the creation of the hotel, owner Mario Delicio wanted to achieve something that was both luxurious and sustainable. \n\"I quickly realised that my dream to provide something luxurious and sustainable was not only possible, but it was also a business model worth sharing, with the potential to change lives and the industry as we know it,\" Delicio, who is also the owner of the Verde Hotels group, said in a statement. \n\"As a hotel management company, this certification has been fundamental in allowing us to provide our potential clients with the assurance that we deliver truly sustainable and commercially viable hospitality solutions,\" he said. \n\"Managing a thrivable hotel means a higher return on investment, lower operational costs, better environmental quality, a lower carbon footprint and a higher PR and marketing value, all whilst safeguarding natural resources and uplifting local communities.\" \nYou can find out more about the hotel here .
