Authorities said they were acting on an Interpol alert from Mexico to arrest Gil, who is wanted on fraud charges there.\nCosta Rica claimed that Gil had been held in inhumane conditions that were not proportional to the fraud charge. Foreign Minister Manuel González accused Nicaragua of keeping Gil from seeing his lawyer and blocking consular services from the Costa Rican Embassy in Managua in violation of the Vienna Convention.\n“We’re very pleased that the Supreme Court of Nicaragua has issued a resolution that grants house arrest for the Costa Rican Gil Trejos. We have given all the consular support that was possible, however, up until this moment we have only received silence on the part of Nicaraguan authorities,” González said in a statement .\nAccording to the Foreign Ministry, Mexico has yet to request Gil’s extradition.", "external_links": ["http://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=servicios%20al%20publico&cat=servicios%20de%20informacion&cont=593&noticia=2389"], "published": "2015-07-08T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:25:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
