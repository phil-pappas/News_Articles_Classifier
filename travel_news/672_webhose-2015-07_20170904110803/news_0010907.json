The man was hoisted to safety by helicopter and flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. He was dehydrated and had other undisclosed injuries.\nThe hiker, from Kennewick, had set out Saturday to do a 24-hour round-trip hike on and around the PCT trail.\nThe sheriff’s office says that at some point, he got mixed up on directions and ended up walking for six hours in the wrong direction before realizing his mistake. He then used his cellphone to call his family to report his location.\n The man had shelter, food and other gear but ran out of water and became dehydrated.\nHis family called for help Sunday night. The search began around 6 a.m. Monday.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T19:29:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
