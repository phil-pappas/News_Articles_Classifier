There's more to see than Berlin or Munich. Here are three wonderful German cities to add to your itinerary. \nEveryone knows about the attractions of Berlin and Munich: one is the capital of the country of Germany, while the other is the capital of the great Oktoberfest! But while there’s much to be discovered in these two wonderful cities, there’s more to this wonderful country as well. \nHere are three other amazing German cities to add to your itinerary, all of which are serviced by a convenient airport shuttle service so you'll be able to get to your accommodation easily. \nCologne \nThe city where the famous perfume originates is one of the largest cities in Germany and a major European holiday destination. Located in North Rhine-Westphalia, right by the River Rhine, Cologne is a bustling metropolis that offers wonderful attractions, a great nightlife and amazing music, arts and culture. \nEven from the first view from your airport shuttle service, you won’t be able to miss the city’s unofficial symbol: Cologne Cathedral, a majestic Gothic building that is said to house gifts of the Magi.While the city has an impressive collection of orchestras and music halls, there are also plenty of art galleries and museums. Make sure you don’t miss the Farina Fragrance Museum, which details the history of the famed Eau de Cologne, and the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, which boasts fine medieval art. \nOh, and don’t forget the beer! Cologne has its own distinctly unique beer called Kolsch, which you can find in practically every bar in town. \nDresden \nFor those looking for exquisite art and grand architecture, look no further than the Jewel Box – Dresden. The capital of the federal state of Saxony, Dresden is considered an important centre of government, industry and culture. \nThe easiest way to get to Dresden is by a flight to Dresden-Klotsche airport. Shuttle service transport from there to your accommodation is easily available, after which, all you’ll need to get around will be your legs or a bike. But there are also buses or trams for getting further distances. \nThe most interesting landmarks are the beautiful plaza of Bruehl’s Terrace, the Zwinger palace complex and, of course, the stunning Frauenkirche cathedral in the Old Town. The Green Vault has thousands of precious gems, jewellery pieces and fine art works, plus there are many theatres and opera houses if you're looking for some entertainment. \nLeipzig \nThe largest city in Germany’s federal state of Saxony is known for its famous composers Bach, Richard Wagner and Felix Mendelssohn. Today, their music can be enjoyed anywhere in this fine city. For a bit of history, head to St. Thomas Church, where you can listen to Bach recitals where the musician once served as cantor/choir leader and is now buried. \nAside from museums, monuments, old churches and historic sites like the Old Town Hall, Leipzig is home to Germany’s oldest botanical garden and one of the country’s largest zoos. It is also home to famous festivals such as the Bach Festival, the world’s largest Goth festival, and an international balloon festival. \nWith today's modern airport shuttle service facilities, any of these cities in Germany make for an excellent short break destination. You could even enjoy a multi-city break and enjoy even more of this wonderfully welcoming country.
