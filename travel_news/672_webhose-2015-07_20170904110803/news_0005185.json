From the very fashion-conscious Bollywood stars to Hollywood style gamechangers, the ladies are confidently rocking frames that you thought would make anyone look hawk-eyed. Take some pointers from Sonam Kapoor's oversized frames, Selena Gomez's pop-hued peepers and Kangana Ranaut's tortoiseshell beauties on how to wear your favourite nerdy frames. Go on, ditch those contact lenses! \n*Square swag: If not during her casual outings, the maximum times we have spotted American singer Taylor Swift sporting nerd-chic glasses has been in her music videos. The most striking ones have been her edgy clubmaster-style, square-shaped oversized frames that she rocked in her video for the hit, Shake It Off. \nTaylor is a great example of ditching the staple rounds and bringing in the shape game. And guess what? We have spotted variations of the style in the Janpath street market, so you can perk up your eyewear without drilling a hole in your pocket. \n*Tortoiseshell frames: Your nerdy glasses need not be always oversized to emanate a sense of whimsy. Case in point - actor Kangana Ranaut who flaunts off-duty chic like a pro, in her mid-sized tortoiseshell frames that looked adorable when offset with her mane of curls. \nIf you think upping the size game doesn't really flatter your face cut, simply pick a pair of frames that is slightly bigger than the normative. You can even pick Lennon frames from markets at Paharganj or Sarojini Nagar and make your geek glamazon look work by DIYing them with nail paint just at the bridge or hinges. \n*Plus size: It's always refreshing to see someone from Bollywood stepping on the gas when it comes to changing their look from time to time. And no one does it better than Sonam Kapoor - the actor really knows how to bring it, even if it means bringing an elemental change in how she styles her looks. We first spotted her geeky-perfect oversized glasses on Instagram when she posted multiple pictures of the cute frames. \n(HT photo / Yogen Shah) \nAnd just when we thought she couldn't rock the look in public, she strutted out in denims and a tee, topped with the same signature glasses. Be inspired and go for exaggerated frames to add a big dose of nerdy chic to your casual ensemble. \n*A touch of retro: Selena Gomez, who shared a picture on Instagram of her bubblegum-hued oversized frames, looked straight out of a retro pop magazine cover. \nIn the past, too, Gomez has sported similar frames with exaggerated cateye tips on either sides - a large bout of inspiration for those who love a touch of Hepburn-chic to their look. And you thought geeky couldn't be sexy! Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T01:47:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
