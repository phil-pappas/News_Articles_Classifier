However, it estimated that only one in five of Easyjet's UK cabin crew voted against the offer.\nUnite criticised the deal, urging the airline \"to drop its high-handed approach and enter back into talks.\"\n\"Cabin crew have worked hard to make Easyjet a success enabling the company to record pre-tax profits in excess of half a billion,\" said Unite regional officer Kevin Hall.\n\"At the same director’s pay has soared by over 18 per cent while the chief executive, Carolyn McCall has seen her pay rise to more than £6 million, over 240 times more than the average cabin crew member.\n“All our members are asking for is a decent pay rise that reflects the important role they have played in making Easyjet a leading airline,” he added.\nEasyjet said it will go ahead with a pay award to staff of a 4.1 per cent rise and 5.1 per cent for cabin managers over the next two years, \"on top of an already market-leading set of pay and conditions in the UK\", despite it being rejected by union members.\n\"We believe it is right to make the award now since cabin crew, the majority of which are not union members, have been waiting for a conclusion to the pay discussions for a number of months,\" the airline said.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-06T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T20:05:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
