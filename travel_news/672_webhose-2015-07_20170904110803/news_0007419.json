Jesse Jackson Visits The Memorial ACTe In The Guadeloupe Islands By PR Newswire | 07/20/15 - 05:00 PM EDT Reprint NEW YORK , July 20, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- During his five-day visit to the French Caribbean archipelago of Guadeloupe , American Civil rights leader and Baptist minister, Reverend Jesse Jackson , toured the \"MEMORIAL ACTe,\" the world's largest museum dedicated to the Memory and History of Slavery from the early seventeenth century to present day. Already called the \"POMPIDOU CENTER\" or the \"MuCEM\" of the Caribbean for its impressive architecture and interactive content, Rev. Jackson's visit to the Memorial ACTe, comes just two months after the inauguration which was attended by French President François Hollande and 19 heads of States from Africa and the Caribbean . Rev. Jackson arrived on the main island of Guadeloupe on Saturday afternoon and received a warm welcome by the Guadeloupe Islands officials and residents. After his official visit to the Memorial ACTe, Rev. Jesse Jackson commented: \"This is the most phenomenal museum of its kind in the whole world. I have been to museums in numerous cities across the world, we are now building a significant one in Washington DC , but this is the most complete museum of ours in the world and this is not the last one. It is the signal we need more museums to tell us about our story.\"By spearheading this project, the Guadeloupe Islands wanted to contribute to the building of a universal and shared memory of Slavery. The intent of the Memorial ACTe is to give voice to memory and to become a cultural and humanitarian beacon of light for the French Caribbean archipelago to the world. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T00:19:37.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
