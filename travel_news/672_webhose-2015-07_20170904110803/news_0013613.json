MGM has released images of the mocked-up guest rooms it will build in the planned 24-story, 308-room hotel tower. The rooms were built out in a warehouse space in Prince George’s County to test and develop what MGM describes as a “serene setting that blends the resort’s surrounding geography with comfortable, functional design.” “The room designs are just the first peek into the incredible collection of amenities we’ve curated to create an unparalleled experience for locals and visitors from around the world,” MGM National Harbor General Manager Bill Boasberg said in a statement. “In an area steeped in tradition, MGM National Harbor will honor the region’s legacy through its design elements while creating a sophisticated resort experience.” The hotel will feature 234 standard guest rooms and 74 suites ranging from 600 to 3,600 square feet. Photos of the suites were not yet available, but we're told they will be consistent with the other guest rooms, though \"enhanced\" in size and features. Designed by New York City-based Studio GAIA, the 400-square-foot standard guest rooms, per MGM (NYSE: MGM), will feature “light-colored woods and monochromatic earth tones,” floor-to-ceiling windows, floor-to-ceiling millwork “similar to that of a yacht’s interior,” desk space and a seating area. Motion sensors will adjust temperature and lighting when guests are not present, while recalling settings when they return. Each room will feature a “distinctive piece of artwork” inspired by the D.C. region, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology, dual vanity sinks, and a shower that “radiates opaque white light,” creating a “sensual shadow play between the bathroom and the bedroom.” In addition to the hotel, the 1-million-square-foot MGM National Harbor will include a 125,000-square-foot casino, a spa, a 3,000-seat transformable theater, 18,000 square feet of branded retail, 27,000 square feet of meeting space and a dozen restaurants. The resort is scheduled to open in the second half of 2016. The first steel is going in now. \nWant Washington, D.C.
