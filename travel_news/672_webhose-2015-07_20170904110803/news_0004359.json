Highlights from two itineraries on the Top 20 list include: Britain & Ireland Explorer A 17-day journey into the British Isles featuring the beauty of the Irish countryside mixed with the historic English towns, Welsh hospitality and the austere Scottish Highlands will leave guests spellbound. Starting in London, a world in one city with around 230 languages spoken, guests will enjoy all that the capital has to offer, from London's West End shows to Buckingham Palace. From London, guests tour the land of Lochs and legends: Scotland. At Edinburgh, guests walk inside the iconic Edinburgh Castle where according to the nation's oldest poetry, tells of a war band feasting here for a year before riding to their deaths in battle. At Fife, golf enthusiasts will rejoice at St. Andrews, the place where golf was born on the Old Course in the 15th century. On the Emerald Isle at Blarney, travellers will have a Signature Experience by dangling from the ramparts to kiss the Stone of Eloquence - also known as \"The Blarney Stone\" where according to legend, the goddess Clíodhna grants anyone who kisses it the gift of the gab. \nBest of Spain & Portugal Against a backdrop of snow-capped sierras and scorching plains, several civilizations have wrestled for control of the Iberian peninsula. On the 16-day itinerary, guests will follow the fortunes of the Spanish, Portuguese and Moorish Kingdoms as evidenced in their grand castles, stupendous religious buildings and incredible works of art. In Madrid, art lovers will rejoice over their visit to one the greatest museums of art in the world, the Museo del Prado. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, the museum features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 19th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection. From Spain to Portugal, guests reach Porto situated on the River Douro and celebrated internationally as the Port wine capital. There, travellers will see the Vila Nova de Gaia wine stores which house the famous wines where guests experience a tasting of the Tawnys and vintages. Back in España, guests have a day of leisure on the sun-drenched Costa del Sol where they can relax by the blue Mediterranean waters or explore Malaga, the birth city of Picasso. In cosmopolitan Barcelona, architect aficionados will marvel at the stunning Basílica of Sagrada Família - a landmark that has the distinction of having taken longer to build than the Great Pyramids of Egypt and is still not complete! \nFor more information, please visit www.insightvacations.com , contact an Insight Specialist at 1-800-387-8490 or contact your local sales manager. \nAbout TreadRight Created as a joint initiative between The Travel Corporation's family of brands, the TreadRight Foundation is a not-for-profit working to ensure the environment and communities we visit remain vibrant for generations to come.
