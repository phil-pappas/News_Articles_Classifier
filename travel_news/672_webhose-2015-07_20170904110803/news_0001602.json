At the time, I was working for a mobile beauty business. I had been feeling in the need for change, and decided to get a new job. I soon realised how helpful qualifications can be when seeking employment, and I didn't have any grades except for my GCSEs. The idea to go to university progressively took shape, and my mother's support definitely encouraged me to go for it. Ucas notified me I had to go through Clearing. I didn’t know much about the process, and I thought I probably wouldn’t get in, but I decided to give it a go. I enrolled on a media production course at the University of Northampton . However, I had to choose a second subject because this degree was only available as a Joint Honours. With a little help from the admissions team, I went through all the different courses I could do alongside media production, and we agreed on web design. Unfortunately, it turned out that the media production course was full. I felt very disappointed. As we started scrolling again through remaining courses, I stumbled upon one that particularly caught my attention: marketing. The course encompassed many fields in business, it went nicely with web design, and I wasn’t sure what to do anyway. So I thought: why not go for it? I felt very lucky to get a place, because it was one of Northampton’s biggest courses. And guess what? I actually preferred marketing to web design. I absolutely loved it. It opened my eyes to so many different things about consumption and business. I realised how easily we get influenced through simple marketing strategies, which truly fascinated me. It’s been really good studying at Northampton, too. I met really nice people, and the campus organises a great variety of extra curricular activities. The staff were extremely helpful and ensured that my Clearing process worked out smoothly. I knew I could rely on them to guide me through every step, by telling me what I needed to do and where I needed to go, etc. I don’t remember being stressed at all, either. I think the whole process was quite simple. If you apply for Clearing, just make sure you start the process as soon as possible. And don’t get put off by it. I didn’t have A-levels grades, but it opened my chances to go to university, thanks to letters of recommendation and references. And, as things turned out, I can say it was definitely worth keeping faith in. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:33:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
