The pair have pledged to share technology and talent in the battle over one of the world’s biggest markets for travel bookings. \nThe Edinburgh-based travel price comparison site and Japan’s leading online portal said on Tuesday they were launching Skyscanner Japan, a search engine dedicated to the country’s multibillion-dollar travel market. More Investors bet $275m on FanDuel \nThe companies will put in a total of $2.5m to launch the joint venture. Skyscanner will hold a 51 per cent stake and Yahoo Japan will own the remaining 49 per cent. \nPrivately owned Skyscanner will provide its technology to power flight search results. Yahoo Japan will promote the travel search engine to its huge web audience in the country, accounting for 60bn monthly page views across its search engine and digital media sites. \nThe joint venture will run independently but both sides will second executives to Tokyo to start the business. A chief executive has yet to be appointed. \nThe Scottish company has been looking to international expansion as a path to overcome slowing revenue growth. The company said in February its 2014 revenues had climbed 42 per cent year on year to £93m but this represented a slowdown from the doubling of turnover recorded in 2013. \nGareth Williams, chief executive of Skyscanner, said: “The joint venture makes sense because we get a chance to integrate directly into the search results of Yahoo Japan, from which we both benefit, and that helps us move up the funnel to the point that someone switches on their phone or computer. We’ll be looking to do more of that with search engines around the world.” \nInternationally, Skyscanner has 35m monthly users but faces fierce competition from the likes of Priceline’s Kayak, a rival travel comparison site, Chinese site Qunar and Google. \nSkyscanner said the joint venture would give it more visibility in a country which represents the world’s third largest travel market and is expected to account for $71bn in travel bookings in 2015, according to travel research group Phocuswright. \nSkyscanner last year bought Youbibi, a Chinese travel search company. The company has seen a 61 per cent year-on-year increase in unique visitors from China, growing to more than 1m users a month. \n“Asia is becoming by far the greatest region for outbound travel,” Mr Williams said. \nSequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital group, acquired a stake in Skyscanner in October 2013, which valued the company at $800m at the time. \nYahoo Japan, which itself began as a joint venture between Yahoo and Japanese technology group SoftBank in 1996, has a market capitalisation of Y2.75tn ($22.1bn).
