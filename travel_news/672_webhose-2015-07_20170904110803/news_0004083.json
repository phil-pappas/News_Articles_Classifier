Commissioner for Consumer Protection Anne Driscoll wants people to come forward after Fremantle’s Sky Air Services agency hits financial troubles. Source: News Limited \nMORE than 70 customers have possibly lost about $240,000 and eight people are stuck overseas as the fallout from Fremantle travel agency Sky Air Services’ financial woes continues. \nWest Australian travellers have been left in the lurch, some stranded overseas, when the travel agency ran into financial difficulties, according to Consumer Protection. \nThe issue came to the attention of Consumer Protection WA when 10 Sky Air Services customers contacted the watchdog reporting flights and accommodation booked by the agency had not been paid for, despite payments to the business. \nSome customers reported turning up at the airport but their flights had either not been booked or had been cancelled due to non-payment. \nOthers due to travel had not been given confirmation of their flight and accommodation bookings. \nBy midday on Friday, the number of customers affected who had come forward had reached 71, with a potential total loss of $240,000. \nConsumer Protection said most of those customers had yet to travel. \nHowever eight customers are currently in Croatia or Serbia with no confirmed return flight. \nA final update on figures is expected later on Friday afternoon. \nCommissioner for Consumer Protection Anne Driscoll said people still might not be aware they have been affected by the agency’s financial problems. \nShe urged customers who booked through Sky Air Services in Fremantle to contact the airline or accommodation provider to ensure that their booking is secure. \n“I also encourage those affected to contact Consumer Protection so we can get an accurate picture of the number of consumers affected by this situation and keep them informed of developments as they occur,” Ms Driscoll said. \nAffected consumers can contact Consumer Protection by email: consumer@commerce.wa.gov.au or call 1300 30 40 54. \nTravel consumers can find tips on the Consumer Protection website: www.commerce.wa.gov.au/travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:37:37.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
