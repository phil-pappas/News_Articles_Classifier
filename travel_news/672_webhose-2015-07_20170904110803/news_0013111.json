Ramside Hall Hotel and Golf Club in Durham has seen a 200 per cent increase in bookings of golf breaks since it opened its new Cathedral Course in September 2014. The hotel and golf club opened the new 7,200 yard championship course on former farmland overlooking the historic University city of Durham. \nThe response to the new course has been so positive that the resort pre-booked more golf breaks - in the period from January to February 2015 - than it sold in the whole of 2014. Tim Boyd, general manager Ramside Hall Hotel and Golf Club, said: “Ramside play-and-stay golf breaks have always been popular with guests but the new golf course has exceeded our expectations in its ability to attract new customers and we look set to have our best-year ever for this area of the business.” The country hotel is a popular wedding, events and meetings venue and is set to unveil a new £12m spa, health club and gymnasium in August. In April, work was completed on 47 new luxury hotel bedrooms – including ‘The Celebration Suite’ – the largest single hotel suite in North East England, all of which are now open for business. “The addition of a luxury spa, health club and gymnasium completes Ramside’s all-round appeal as a hotel, golf and leisure destination and we look forward to welcoming lots more people to Durham to enjoy rest, relaxation and great golf,” added Mr. Boyd. Ramside Hall Hotel and Golf Club’s original 18-hole championship golf course, The Prince Bishops, opened in 1996 and is recognised as one of the North East’s best courses. The new investment has helped realise a 10-year plan to transform Ramside into one of the UK’s premier 36-hole golf destinations. The opening of the Cathedral Course has also helped Ramside Golf Club grow its membership to record levels. The club welcomed its 500th member in March and a number of new initiatives have made it easier and more affordable to join. An innovative new membership called Flexi-Golf enables golfers to join the club for a lower fee and pay for only as much golf as they have time to play. Helen Roseberry, director of golf at Ramside Hall Hotel and Golf Club, said: “Ramside Golf Club is experiencing the most positive and exciting time in our history. Our aim is to grow golf in the North East and be a friendly, welcoming place where people love to play our courses and enjoy our hospitality.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:10:09.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
