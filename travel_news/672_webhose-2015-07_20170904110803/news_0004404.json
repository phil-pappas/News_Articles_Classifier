Although duty-free shopping (i.e., shopping exempt from paying duties or taxes) was abolished for travel within the European Union (EU) some years ago, domestic and EU travelers at FRA can still buy at attractive reduced prices. At the special “Travel Value” shops located throughout FRA’s terminals, passengers flying within the EU pay the same prices for perfume and spirits as they would when shopping at the airport’s duty-free shops when traveling internationally outside the EU. \nAll passengers can benefit from clear price advantages over high-street stores when shopping at FRA’s Duty Free & Travel Value shops. They can choose from the vast range of products offered at the stores. For example, perfumes and spirits can be purchased with savings of up to 30 or 40 percent. Don’t miss the world premiere this summer of \"The Scent” – the new men's fragrance from Boss – which is now available exclusively at FRA’s Duty Free & Travel Value shops, before its worldwide sales launch. \nFrom the comfort of your home, you can surf and shop at FRA’s Duty Free & Travel Value stores. Check out the tremendous selection, see what is on offer, browse at your leisure and order online before your actual flight. This pre-order service allows travelers to order products up to 12 hours before departure. On arrival at FRA, the products will be already packed and ready to pick up conveniently from the shop.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:01:43.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
