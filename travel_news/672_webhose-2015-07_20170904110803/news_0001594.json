When the vacation you are packing for is Key West this summertime, only half of that adage is true. Pack half as much clothing: When you are done getting all of the clothes out that you think you will need, immediately separate it into two piles. When separating, keep in mind that one of those piles will not be joining you, so pick accordingly. Ironically, one thing you will want to pack is a pair of long pants and a sweater or sweatshirt. You might think it is strange, seeing as how hot you probably expect Key West to be, but there are a couple of things to consider. First of all, because of the trade winds and its location a hundred or so miles out in open water, Key West tends to be up to ten degrees cooler than other parts of Florida. Secondly, even though the temperature may only fluctuate about 15 to 20 degrees at most between day and night, an accompanying drop in humidity - not to mention the chills that come with the sunburn you might end up with - will make it feel much cooler, especially if you are out enjoying a sunset sail. Something that you may be thinking about bringing that can stay at home is your fancy going out to dinner clothes. Even the nicest Key West restaurants have a dress code best described as \"casual elegance,\" meaning your best flip flops and most stylish tropical shirt. Unless you are going to the island for specific formal occasion, like a destination wedding, leave the jacket and tie at home. The flip side of the old saying, take twice as much money, is not something you have to worry about when you visit Key West in the summertime. Although the stark line between high season and low season has slowly been eroding over the last several years, summertime is still the slow season on the island, and many of the Key West restaurants and businesses respond by offering deep discounts on their services. Hotel rates tend to be lower as well, and a summertime vacation may result in a substantial amount of savings. Of course, you may find yourself wanting to see and do as much as you can, especially because the smaller crowds make it easier to get into the most popular attractions. That is okay, too. As a fully functioning city as well as a resort destination, there are plenty of banks and ATMs located throughout Key West should the need arise. \nJack Terry is a freelance travel and lifestyle writer who has lived in Key West for several years. http://www.rooftopcafekeywest.com   07   7  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:42:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
