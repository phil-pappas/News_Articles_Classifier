More Telefónica nets €600m La Liga TV deal \nRed Planet Hotels, which owned and operated 21 Tune Hotel locations in the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand, said it has ended its partnership with Tune. It has launched a new hotel chain of 24 sites under the Red Planet brand, into which it has put the properties formerly run under the Tune brand. \n“We’ve decided to launch our own brand and go our own way,” said Red Planet Hotels. It said it had served out a required notice period and that “there were no financial penalties on either side.” Red Planet declined to say how much the deal was worth. \nThe privately owned company, founded in 2010, bought a 16 per cent stake in Tune Hotels in July 2012 and said it is still negotiating with Mr Fernandes’ company over whether it will retain that holding. \n“It’s all about value,” said Tim Hansing, chief executive, in a statement. “Value for our customers and creating value for our shareholders.” \nThe development leaves Tune Hotels, which helped pioneer the budget hotel format, with just 23 locations in five countries — primarily in Malaysia, where it is based, and in the UK . \nIn October, Tune Group said it would invest £200m in its UK budget hotel operations with the aim of opening 25 new sites over the next five years. \nMr Fernandes’ sprawling Tune Group empire includes the Tune Hotels venture, his AirAsia holdings and Queens Park Rangers, the English football team. All have generated negative headlines in the past year or so for Mr Fernandes. \nHis investment in QPR has failed to bring success to the struggling club, with the team relegated last season and facing a possible £58m fine for overspending. \nLast year, Mr Fernandes sold his Formula One motoring team, Caterham, after an unsuccessful four-year foray into the sport. “F1 hasn’t worked,” he said in a tweet at the time. \nAirAsia shares have fallen almost 42 per cent in the past 12 months following a plane crash in December at its Indonesian affiliate and questions about the sustainability of the business. \nA spokesperson for Tune Hotels in the UK declined to comment. Tune Hotels in Malaysia did not respond to requests for comment. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
