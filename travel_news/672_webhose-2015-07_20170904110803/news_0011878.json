It feels like its own country, separate from the US.\nAnd it’s known as a party town but it’s so much more. The reason everybody is partying (beyond the fact you can drink ‘Hurricanes’ — giant, colourful, extremely alcoholic slushies — in the street 24/7) is because they are celebrating the richest, most diverse, colourful and exciting culture in the United States.\nEvolving from a distinctive mixture of migrant cultures the uniqueness of New Orleans is palpable as soon as you cross one of its long swamp bridges (passing disconcerting alligator roadkill) and enter the gulf city.\nFood is a central part of the identity of New Orleans, and the dish that is not only its most famous one but also acts as a metaphor of the cultural mishmash of the whole joint is gumbo. A rich and colourful soup/stew combining seafood, sausage and vegetables, gumbo is a culinary combination of West African, French, Spanish, German and Native American tastes. And this mix is reflected in the heritage of the city’s population.\nGumbo is a mixture of seafood, sausages and vegetables combined into a soup or stew. Source: News Corp Australia\nAlongside food, at the middle of the New Orleans melting pot, is its music and that’s what lured us to the city. Having its roots in Africa, Europe and Latin America, the city’s musical evolution has culminated in today’s line up of world-class music of many genres. The rhythm of the brass bands is the beating heart of the music scene, pumping proudly and loudly in houses, clubs and in the streets.\nAustralian cities could learn a lot from New Orleans. Loud, live music is not only tolerated but prioritised and valued, as an integral part of the peoples’ identity and the city’s economy.\nWithout a doubt the most eye-opening of the music movements we found ourselves immersed in was the New Orleans bounce scene.\nThis is not only a unique genre of hip-hop music but also a way of life for many in New Orleans with the dance style associated with this music, twerking, recently reaching global fame through the co-opting of the style by mainstream musicians, most notably with Miley Cyrus’ infamous attempts at shaking her ass.\nNew Orleans locals were twerking way before Miley was even born.

Source: SBS\nThe club we visited was by far the most raucous we’d ever attended but a party can be found somewhere in New Orleans every day. In fact, on a whim, myself and my Unplanned America colleagues shut down bustling Bourbon Street one busy Saturday with our own boozy parade. Legally.\nThe Unplanned America boys shut down Bourbon Street in New Orleans. Source: SBS\nYep three Aussie boys were able to take over one of the most historic main streets in America. We were led by a four-vehicle police escort and tailed by a marching brass band right in the middle of the day.\nWith a permit for the low price of $300 and giving only 24 hours notice, we became the raucous centrepoint of the celebration culture of New Orleans for a 45 whole minutes. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and anyone can do it! The city encourages it!\nThe permit to shut down the main street and bring in a brass band was only $300. Source: SBS\nIn many ways the painful memory of Hurricane Katrina, which decimated large parts of New Orleans 10 years ago, still lingers but it’s as if this has made the people more defiantly proud of their rich culture, more determined to fight for it.\nAnd the way these folks fight is on the street, with the blow of a trumpet; with the camaraderie of a shared delicious meal; with a full heart, a spring in their step and a shake of the arse. Because they know how unique, valuable and damn cool this culture is.\nUnplanned America screens tonight at 9pm on SBS2 and is available on SBS OnDemand. Series One is on Netflix.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1&title=The+ultimate+party+city", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+ultimate+party+city&c=THERE+is+a+city+in+the+US+that+encourages+you+to+lock+down+the+main+street+and+have+a+party.+Where+twerking+began+and+the+music+never+stops.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1&title=The+ultimate+party+city", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1&h=The+ultimate+party+city", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/the-us-city-where-twerking-began-and-you-can-lock-down-the-main-street-on-a-whim/story-e6frfqc9-1227422291248?sv=ebe21d65b75e957f011c3e0e51cca6c1", "http://www.sbs.com.au/programs/unplanned-america/"], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T03:14:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
