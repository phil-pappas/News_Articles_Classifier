Confronting ... Former Prime Minister Paul Keating tells it like it is at the Mantra Group Conference at Kingscliff.

This will be a challenge for the next five to seven years given incomes in China will continue to rise.”\nMr Keating suggested the issue was not only one for the tourism industry but for the whole country which he suggested, had made little progress since he left politics.\n“Australia’s living off 1980s and 1990s policy changes,” he said.\n“And now we have a political culture that has the ambition of a gnat.”\nThe world economy was also “soggy” and in a depressionary cycle, the likes of which had not been seen since the period from 1974 to 1982.\n“I think tourism is going to be an important contributor to recovery, if we set ourselves up for opportunities coming out of China,” Mr Keating said. Hard line ... The Hon. Paul Keating, Former Australian Prime Minister at Kingscliff.

Big attraction ... The Great Barrier Reef will be a major part of a new international tourism campaign. Picture: Tourism Australia Source: Supplied\nOnline searches for our beaches declined ten per cent in the last year, and only one — Whitehaven in the Whitsundays — made TripAdvisor’s 2015 list of the world’s top 25 beaches.\nMs Ronson said a new campaign being planned by Tourism Australia for later this year would focus on the coastline and waterways, and in particular the Great Barrier Reef.\n“We’re going to invite the world over to our place for a swim,” she told delegates.\nShe stressed the importance of a strong online profile given 70 per cent of pictures on Facebook were “tourism related”.\n“That’s having a big impact on how people decide to go to locations,” said Ms Ronson.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Paul+Keating+slaps+down+hotels&c=NEVER+one+to+mince+words%2C+former+Prime+Minister+Paul+Keating+has+delivered+a+trademark+kick+up+the+pants+to+the+hotel+industry.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21&title=Paul+Keating+slaps+down+hotels", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21&title=Paul+Keating+slaps+down+hotels", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21&h=Paul+Keating+slaps+down+hotels", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/paul-keating-gives-some-tough-love-to-hoteliers/story-fn6yjmti-1227443585816?sv=d9d96795cb59aa218877a863f90d2e21"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:57:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
