Here are some tips from AAA: PACK SMART • A few basics to have on board during road trips include a small first aid kit, your vehicle owner’s manual, a flashlight, a tire pressure gauge, jumper cables, paper towels, extra water and snacks. • Always keep a fully-charged cell phone with you so you can call for help in case of a breakdown. Carrying a car charger for your cell phone is also a good idea. • Download the free AAA Mobile app for iPhone, iPad and Android. The app lets users check current gas prices along their route, book AAA-approved hotels and find AAA-approved restaurants, check AAA discounts, call for AAA roadside assistance, find a AAA Approved Auto Repair shop, learn about points of interest, access maps and get turn-by-turn directions.
