Noticeably, there's not an actual granny in sight. Despite the pains one must go through to turn your hair grey - a peroxide and toner combination repeated until the desired colour is achieved - Amazon has recently reported an 83 per cent spike in sales of grey hair dye , attributed to youngsters seeking to emulate George Clooney. • How to go grey gracefully Actress Dascha Polanco and model Cara Delevingne are in on the #GrannyHair trend (Instagram/SheIsDash) For Jo Hansford, owner of Jo Hansford salon , the trend is somewhat baffling. To Jo, grey hair has always been a sign of ageing. She previously told The Telegraph : \"You look at people who have it and you just think: \"Seriously? Why?\" We all have to grow old, but we don't have to be boring. We all have to be glamorous\" and her opinion hasn't changed. • 'I dress like my granddaughter' In Jo's salon going grey isn't even an option: \"I don't let any of my clients go grey. It's incredibly ageing for anyone over the age of 40.\" Aged 82, Joan Collins remains a youthful brunette She cites Joan Collins as an inspiration for anyone considering bowing to their grey hairs: \"Nobody over 60 wants to look like an old granny. You'd be hard pressed to find any grey grannies around these days. The only people who can get away with it are the highly glamorous, so the Judi Denches or the Helen Mirrens - though even they're not completely grey. They have a little bit of tone in their hair and that makes all the difference.\" \"But I can't see why anyone else would dye their hair grey. Just look at Joan Collins, nobody would believe she is 82.\" So why are the young so determined to grey prematurely? \"It's a statement,\" says Jo, \"all the celebrities, they've done every bright and bold colour under the sun , so what's next? The only other 'shocking' colour left is grey. The reason they can get away with it is because they have young faces. When you're young, your hair is naturally shiny and glossy and your muscles are taunt, so having grey hair doesn't age you.\" • Allison Pearson: Finally, I'm glad to be grey \"But when you're older you need all the shine and gloss you can get, having grey hair just isn't flattering.\" Does this rise of young people hoping to emulate Cara Delevingne or George Clooney mean a generation eager to embrace their natural greys in twenty years time? Jo is doubtful. \"At 24 my daughter recently found her first grey hair. I asked her what she did about it and she told me she pulled it out. When the girls dyeing their hair grey today get their first real grey hair, they won't be so excited.\" 34-year-old Mandi Hewlett has been dyeing her hair since she was 20 to cover the grey and admits she can't imagine not dyeing it now: \"I might consider going completely grey when I'm in my 70s, but until then I am happy to carry on dyeing my hair.\" • Are women ever glad to be grey? Like Jo, Mandi believes #GrannyHair is just a trend, though she sees it in a slightly more positive light: \"I don't think this trend will stay around for long, but I think it's a really good thing as it gives us women the confidence to go grey naturally if we wanted to.\" \"Some girls look really good with the colour, though I'm not sure if I could pull it off just yet - hence why I dye it.\" New color ice grey ish, call it #Brrr A photo posted by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Jul 17, 2013 at 7:58pm PDT Sasha Harris, 19, dyed her hair grey after seeing her idol Rihanna do it in 2013. \"It wasn't a colour I'd ever considered before, but it looked really good on her so I thought I should give it a go,\" says Sasha - now back to her natural shade of black. \"I really liked it, I got a lot of compliments from people my age but my parents weren't happy. They said it made me look much older so they were pretty glad when I dyed it back to normal.\" As Jo predicted, Sasha has no intention of naturally going grey anytime soon: \"If I saw a real grey hair tomorrow I'd pull it out straight away,\" she says, \"I'm definitely not ready to go grey for real.\" Follow @TeleGoodLife Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:15:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
