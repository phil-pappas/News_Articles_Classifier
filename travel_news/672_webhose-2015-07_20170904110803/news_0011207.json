But, even so, there was a big gap in the omission of Hydra. It would be best for tranquillity with its absence of motorised transport, yet the island bustles with local life – last September we shared a wedding party at a taverna in one of the local squares. Hydra played a significant role in the struggle for Greek independence in the 1820s, as evidenced in the stately mansions owned by the seafarers of past years, and the stirring stories told in the maritime museum. Hydra has a strong cultural and artistic side and a famous recent visitor was Leonard Cohen: can you meet the challenge of tracking down the location of the house that he bought on the island in the early Sixties? We did!

Certainly it’s not beautiful but it has so much of interest and is a lively working city. The morning market stalls along Via Pignasecca, all the little specialist food shops, craftsmen at work carving nativity scenes, to say nothing of the narrow streets with washing hanging out and walls covered in graffiti, all contribute to the atmosphere. Janet Liebster Photo: Getty Naples is, as your expert Lee Marshall said, a culture shock in parts, but there is always something amazing around the next corner. For €32 (£22.50), you can buy a three-day Tutta la Regione Campania Arte Card, giving you access to all public transport. It was great value and we found the whole break immensely interesting, enjoyable and inexpensive. Margaret Knights See Pompeii Don’t be put off by the crowds at Pompeii; use them positively as part of the experience. Pompeii is a spectacularly well-preserved city and cities are always crowded, so think of the crowd as making your visit more realistic. I was surprised at how I saw the site as a living, bustling metropolis and my wife even found herself looking to see if it was safe to cross the road. How much more realistic can you get than that? When you move away from the core where the tour groups provide the crowds, you will find many peripheral areas refreshingly quiet. Welcome to the authentic Roman city experience. John McGrath Take the train Further to Lee Marshall’s advice, the Circumvesuviana Regional Railway System, called Vesuviana by locals, runs from Naples to Sorrento and provides a great opportunity to see the countryside at first hand. It is a bit of a primitive train but a novel experience. There is a service (express) to Sorrento every 30 minutes and a stopping train in between. Last time I used it the cost was €3 (£2) one way. When entering Pompeii you will be approached by guides offering their services. Don’t be put off. Find one you can easily understand and ask to join his party rather than hiring him. That will cost about €10 (£7) and is well worth it. Also take the opportunity to visit Herculaneum on the same line – it is more interesting than Pompeii. G Barry Higgs MCIOB Photo: Getty Bar to murderers Heaven forfend if a real murder did occur in the Burgh Island Hotel (“Romance, magic and mystery on the trail of Agatha Christie”, July 25), but the sleuth’s task would be eased by the restrictions we encountered a couple of years ago. The gates were firmly closed to day-trippers hoping for afternoon tea and a nosy around the hotel’s much vaunted Art Deco interior. This residents-only policy also applied to the neighbouring hostelry, although a sign outside made an exception for “regulars” who obviously would be well known to the local plods and could be eliminated from inquiries at an early stage. John Samson Last call for diners The most magic moment on last year’s skiing holiday? The view? The ski instructor? The food? No, finding that our hotel banned all electronic devices from the dining room. No more arguments with stroppy teenagers, just conversation. Could other hotels please follow suit?
