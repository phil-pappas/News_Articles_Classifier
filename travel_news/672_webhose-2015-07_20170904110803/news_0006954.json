It aims to inspire more efficient and sustainable ways of doing business.\nThe owner of the establishment, Bernard Pool received the certificate on Wednesday morning from the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St.Ange in the presence of the principal secretary for tourism Anne Lafortune and that of culture Benjamine Rose.\nOfficially opened in November 2014, Heliconia Grove situated right on the beach at Cote D’Or is made up of eight individual villas spread across beautifully landscaped gardens, keeping the natural environment pristine.\nMinister St.Ange said Heliconia Grove has shown that even a new property can achieve such a feat quite fast.\nHe added that hotels that have received such certificate will be given publicity by the Seychelles Tourism Board in the various international trade fairs. “We shall ensure that the world at large knows the hotel properties that have adopted the sustainable practices as part of their management style” Minister St.Ange said.\nMinister Alain St.Ange said hotels adopting sustainable practices are seen as a support to the country. He also echoed words of congratulations to all the hoteliers who have ventured into carrying out sustainable practices at their establishments.\nThe owners and management of Heliconia Grove have put a lot of effort in constructing and in operating an eco-friendly establishment.\nThe building concept and architectural design favouring natural ventilation, the use of solar energy and emphasis on using native or indigenous plants to blend in the natural environment, as well as finding ways to reduce water consumption have all contributed in making this establishment a sustainable one.\nWith the aim of supporting the local community, all consumable items used at the hotel are purchased locally. The furniture in the establishment have all been supplied by a local carpenter.\nHeliconia Grove is made up of an all-Seychellois workforce, and is managed by Herve Rose.\nBeing in operation for the past six months, Heliconia Grove has already given back to the community by sponsoring a local sports club. and it must be mentioned enjoys a 100% Seychellois workforce.\nHeliconia Grove has easily met the required points to qualify for the label. The criteria requires that apart from the must criteria, a small establishment must achieve a minimum of five points for each of the eight themes of the label. The hotel managed to exceed the required points for six out of these eight themes. The establishment obtained 21 points above the required total points to qualify for the label.\nAs part of its plans to further enhance its sustainable practices, the establishment has recently invested in photovoltaic cells to generate electricity and installed roof water storage tanks. There are also giant tortoises there that help with the control of leaves and garden waste, and in addition, they also produce manure used for gardening.\nThe establishment is very enthusiastic to further engage in sustainable practices as their contribution to making the Seychelles tourism industry a sustainable one.\nHeliconia Grove is the sixth hotel to receive the Seychelles Sustainable Tourism Label certificate after Hanneman Holiday Residence, Berjaya Beau Vallon Bay Resort & Casino, Constance Ephelia Resort & Spa, Banyan Tree Seychelles and Kempinski Seychelles Resort.\nSource:- Seychelles Tourism\nTags: Seychelles tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:59:04.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
