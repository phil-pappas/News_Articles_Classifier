But surely there must be a statute of limitations on such vows? And in any case, the Pisciottani are so simpatici, and business is still so slow outside of the canonic Italian beach months of July and August, that I can live with the small betrayal. Pisciotta is the kind of small, southern Italian coastal town that you have a picture of in your head, but often struggle to match in the real world. The old town sits on a hill just back from its seaside frazione or offshoot, Marina di Pisciotta. It’s a place of narrow lanes sandwiched between pastel-painted houses, ancient stepped alleyways leading to hidden chapels, small piazzas with their inevitable external fauna of old men in hats playing cards or simply watching the world go by. • Italy summer holiday guide Below, between the lower skirts of the town and a sea so clean that the beach regularly features as one of Italy’s 'Bandiera Blu’ environmentally-virtuous resorts, lie the centuries-old olive groves that give this part of the coast such an archaic Mediterranean feel. It’s one of those places where you fully expect to meet goatherds tooting on pan pipes. From the arched loggia of imposing 17th-century Palazzo Ciaccio, a stroll down the ancient paved path known as La Chiusa brings you into the heart of the olive belt, and it’s a lovely walk even in the summer heat, with the fronds arching over the path in places like a green tunnel. The whole of the Cilento is now a protected nature reserve; last time I ventured back up this path from the beach I saw a hoopoe, its punky crest backlit by the setting sun. • Marettimo, Italy: Secret Seaside • Porto Selvaggio, Italy: Secret Seaside • Cala Gonone, Sardinia: Secret Seaside &quot;The old town sits on a hill just back from its seaside frazione or offshoot, Marina di Pisciotta. It’s a place of narrow lanes sandwiched between pastel-painted houses, ancient stepped alleyways leading to hidden chapels&quot; Photo: AP/FOTOLIA A 20-minute walk from the town brings you down to the Marina di Pisciotta, a thin scatter of fishermen’s cottages, modest hotels and restaurants strung out along the edge of a surprisingly busy fishing port. It’s this that has helped to preserve Pisciotta from selling its soul to tourism. Fishing is still an important activity here: especially the age-old form of anchovy fishing, peculiar to this village, using hand-woven menaica nets that let smaller fish to escape but leave larger ones trapped in the mesh, allowing them to be picked off and preserved immediately between layers of salt in terracotta jars — or taken fresh to one of the beachside trattorias, where they are served up every which way, with every course except dessert (and they’re working on that). • Tuscany travel guide • Umbria travel guide Marina di Pisciotta, a thin scatter of fishermen’s cottages, modest hotels and restaurants Photo: AP/FOTOLIA The half-mile-long, gently-shelving strip of beach that extends north from the fishing port is a mix of flat grey-white pebbles (once used by the local washerwomen as drying weights) and sand, with the latter predominating by the shoreline itself. For more sand between your toes, head four miles south towards Palinuro, where the three-mile-long Le Saline beach is the ultimate laid-back, family-friendly Italian strand. Getting there Closest airport is Naples ( aeroportodinapoli.it ), which is served from several UK airports, including London airports ( ba.com , easyjet.com , Meridiana, Monarch), Bristol ( easyjet.com ), Manchester ( monarch.co.uk ), Liverpool ( easyjet.com ) and Edinburgh ( easyjet.com ). An Alibus shuttle (every 20 mins) connects the airport with Napoli Centrale station, from where trains run to Pisciotta-Palinura station (journey time around 2 hours; tickets from €8/£5.76; times at trenitalia.com ). Naples is the nearest major city Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Where to stay La Casa sul Blu £ Opened in 2013, this utterly simple, unpretentious B&B on a quiet lane is a perfect budget choice. Perks include sweeping views down the coast, Cristina’s homemade jams and cakes at breakfast, and a tour of an ancient but well-preserved nearby olive mill. (00 39 0974 973 834; www.lacasasulblu.it ; doubles from £33). Marulivo ££ Pisciotta’s most stylish boutique hotel, Marulivo consists of eleven smart vintage-chic bedrooms carved out of a former convent in the centro storico, plus four nearby family apartments and a five-berth stone house amidst the olives. (00 39 0974 973 792; marulivohotel.it ; sea-view doubles from £64; open end Mar — end Oct). Villaggio Lido Paradiso ££ This family-oriented Lido has its own pebble and sand beach just south of the Marina, plus a decent-sized pool. Accommodation is in bungalows (some with air-con) amidst olive and oleander terraces. Kids are well catered for with activities, play areas and inflatables. (00 39 0974 973 232; www.lidoparadiso.it ; bungalows from £550 a week for two adults and one child, full board; open June-Sept). Where to eat Osteria del Borgo £ In the heart of the centro storico, this simple seafood trattoria, with outside tables on a veranda warmed on cooler days by patio heaters, is the best bet for a good-value meal in the old town. The sauté of clams and mussels is as good as they come this side of Naples. (00 39 0974 970 113; open Apr-Oct) Angiolina ££ Founded as a railway worker’s canteen in 1958, this garden trattoria is my favourite of Marina’s seafood eateries. Pisciotta anchovies take star billing — try the friselle (a little like bruschette) with mozzarella and anchovies — but they also do great things with vegetables and wild herbs (as in the local spring veg cauraro soup) (00 39 0974 973 188; open Apr-Oct). The region is known for its delicious anchovies Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Perbacco ££ Amidst the olive groves north of Pisciotta, this country restaurant is committed, Slow-Food-style, to the local tradition, using only the freshest garden produce, seafood and meat. Don’t miss the vermicelli Marina Campagna pasta — with fresh anchovies, wild fennel, cherry tomatoes and green chillis. (00 39 0974 973 889; open June to mid-Oct) The inside track Night-time anchovy fishing excursions can be arranged by local fisherman Pasquale Cammarano: tel +39 347 826 0211. Did you know? Velia, a scenic archaeological site just north of Pisciotta, was once a flourishing Greek colony where philosopher Zeno was born — he of the 'Achilles and the tortoise’ paradox.
