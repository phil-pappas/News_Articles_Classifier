The decline likely is the result of surging populations of sharks' prey, such as sea lions and elephant seals.\nResearchers say there might also be fewer sharks in the water, though their populations are hard to track.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:16:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
