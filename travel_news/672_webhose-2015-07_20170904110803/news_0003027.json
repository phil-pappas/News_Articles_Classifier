WASHINGTON D.C. â€” \nRecent security issues have raised questions about whether the Transportation Security Administration is performing its \"no-fail mission.\" A government audit last month found that TSA screeners missed 95 percent of mock weapons and bombs in an undercover investigation. \nBut Wednesday, the new head of the TSA, Peter Neffenger, said over the next 60 days every TSA employee will be trained on the mistakes that allowed those mock weapons to get through. Neffenger has been on the job for only a month. \nAfter investigators said a gun smuggling operation run by an airlines employee was busted at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, Atlanta airport officials pledged to become the third airport in the country to have all employees go through security screenings. \nNeffenger said he's investigating whether all airports should have to conduct more employee screening. \nNeffenger said he also wants to eliminate boarding passes and have passengers use biometric data , like fingerprints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T03:35:49.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
