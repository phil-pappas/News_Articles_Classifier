Four nights’ sailing takes in the Three Gorges Dam before a tributary is explored. Two nights are then spent in Chongqing to view the Unesco-protected 7th-century Dazu rock carvings, the Hongya Cave and traditional-style stilted buildings. \nA bullet train journey to Chengdu takes clients to the Panda Breeding Centre and to the Bronze Age City of Sanxingdui. Other highlights include a journey along the Li river, a visit to a tea plantation, the Terracotta Warriors and three nights in Beijing. \nThe 17-night tour leads in at £2,899pp including UK chauffeur transfers, accommodation, all flights, most meals, visa and insurance. It runs from April to November 2016. \nSaga is also introducing a new river cruise from Prague, with a 724-mile journey along the river Elbe. \nThe operator’s Beauty of Bohemia cruise includes a visit to Dresden and Pirna, in the former East Germany, which Canaletto painted 11 times. \nThe 10-night package starts from £1,299pp, departing Heathrow, Manchester and Edinburgh on April 15, 2016.
