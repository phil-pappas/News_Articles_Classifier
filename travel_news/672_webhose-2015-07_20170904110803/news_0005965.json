The launch facilities are operated by the Russian Federal Space Agency and the Russian Aerospace Defense Forces, to which the Kazakh government has them leased until 2050. Given this particular situation the project, should it come to fruition, would have to be approved by the Russian authorities, who would also have to sanction each and every visit to take place after the project is completed. \nBut even if the Russian pose any difficulties to the project – and they aren’t likely to, as they could also profit from it – the Baikonur Cosmodrome still holds immense potential as a tourist attraction, not only because of its current activity, which is still abundant, especially seeing as all Russian crewed spacecraft is launched there, but also because of its history, seeing as both Vostok 1 and Sputnik 1 were launched at Baikonur, a fact which is sure to attract enthusiasts to the spaceport, as it can easily be accessed through the local military airport, even if it is under Russian authority as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:06:21.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
