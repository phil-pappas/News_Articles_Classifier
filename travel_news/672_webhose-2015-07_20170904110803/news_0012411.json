Victoria Xipolitakis tweeted photos, since removed, showing her sandwiched between pilots Patricio Zocchi Molina, 33, and Federico Matias Soaje, 37, during a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Rosario, Argentina, reports Mashable . But that's not all: In one of six videos Xipolitakis, 29, recorded, a pilot can be heard telling her that she can fly the plane; she claims she flew the aircraft during takeoff. Xipolitakis, who is now banned from the airline for five years, has since apologized. Fox News Latino reports some of the 36 passengers on board are preparing to sue the airline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T02:01:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
