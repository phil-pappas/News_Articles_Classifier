It is a strategic development - born from increasing client demand - to bundle the services we provide across these three areas of expertise (Insight & Performance, Meetings & Events, Healthcare Communications). Our drive for collaborative working is ensuring we continue to innovate and find successful solutions for our clients. By sharing office space it will make it easy for us to draw on the collective and connected experience we have within Ashfield to help deliver insight-led, personalised experiences.” Charlotte Crowe (Performance Director, Ashfield Insight & Performance) added: “By combining our services we are adding real value to clients. We already have a number of mutual clients and the team are looking forward to working together and connecting the dots to offer new solutions and enhance our new business effectiveness”. The Insight & Performance team will now share Charter Point House with seven client-facing Meeting & Events teams, the dedicated venue finding, travel and engagement teams, as well as SPARK THINKING and the centralised support functions.
