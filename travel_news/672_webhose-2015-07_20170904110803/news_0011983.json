The British government is resisting mounting calls for the Army to be sent in to deal with the deepening crisis, which has claimed the life of at least one migrant this week . The man, believed to be a Sudanese national, was killed on Tuesday night after he was reportedly crushed by a truck. On Wednesday night, hundreds more migrants tried to reach Britain from Calais as they made new attempts to storm the Channel Tunnel, undeterred by heightened security. • Live updates: Calais migrants undeterred by Channel Tunnel security blitz Speaking in Vietnam during his south-east Asian tour, the Prime Minister said the French had sent an extra 120 police and the UK was investing in fencing and security measures at the Channel crossings in Calais and Coquelles. Mr Cameron, who has become the first serving Prime Minister to visit Vietnam , said: \"This is very testing, I accept that, because you have got a swarm of people coming across the Mediterranean, seeking a better life, wanting to come to Britain because Britain has got jobs, it's got a growing economy, it's an incredible place to live. \"But we need to protect our borders by working hand in glove with our neighbours the French and that is exactly what we are doing.\" Migrants near Eurotunnel in Coquelles near Calais (AP) Mr Cameron added: \"The French are sending an extra 120 police, Theresa May the Home Secretary has chaired a Cobra meeting to co-ordinate all this activity. We need to work together very closely with the French, very closely with the companies. \"But we do need to recognise the source of this problem, which is people crossing the Mediterranean in search of a better life. We have got to deal with that problem at its source as well.\" David Cameron, on a visit to Vietnam (PA) He said making Britain “a less easy place for illegal immigrants to stay” by restricting their ability to access bank accounts, council housing and stepping up removals would tackle the crisis. “All of these actions - the internal border - matters, as it were, as well as the external border,” he said. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:52:24.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
