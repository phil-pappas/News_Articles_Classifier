The free attraction, which opened to the public on Wednesday, also offers information on the fort’s history and the surrounding area. \nFort Siloso, previously a gated attraction, will also permanently open its grounds to all visitors without charge. Guides will be available for those seeking in-depth knowledge of the historical site \nSkywalk was unveiled on July 14 by S Iswaran, Second Minister for Trade and Industry, during the official launch of the new Sentosa Line, which is an extension of the existing Mount Faber cable car line. \nThe new line, which costs the Sentosa Development Corporation more than S$78 million (RM216.7 million), will travel to three stations — Merlion, Imbiah Lookout and Siloso Point — around the island. \nThe two cable car lines are separated by a three- to five- minute walk between the Sentosa station on the Mount Faber line and the Imbiah Lookout station on the Sentosa line. \nThe new line, which has 51 cable cars located 80 metres above the ground, spans 890m, compared to the 1.65km Mount Faber line. \nEach cable car can sit eight people, and the Sentosa line will be able to carry 2,200 passengers per hour in a single direction. \nThe three-station route will take visitors 15 minutes to complete. They can expect a waiting time of 10 minutes during off-peak hours, and 30-45 minutes during peak hours. \nApart from offering visitors scenic views of the island, the new line also gives visitors convenient access to attractions in the western part of the island, such as Underwater Water World Singapore. Such spots were previously only accessible by shuttle bus, as the monorail does not travel there. \nThe Sentosa line, which had its soft launch in early June, has seen about 1,000 visitors daily, compared to the 3,000 who use the Mount Faber Line. \nThe standard price for a trip on the Sentosa line costs S$13, while a Cable Car Sky Pass, which allows a visitor to use both lines, costs S$29. \nHowever, as part of the SG50 celebrations, Singaporeans and permanent residents will need to pay only S$9 for a trip on the Sentosa line, and $19 for a Cable Car Sky Pass permanently. \nRides on the Singapore Cable Car Sky Network will also be free for these local visitors from 9am to 9pm on August 10. \nIswaran, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “While it is encouraging to see good growth for Sentosa amid an increasingly competitive tourism landscape, we need to continue with our efforts to refresh and rejuvenate our offerings in line with market needs and demands to reach out to our target segments in the tourism sector.” \nPete Nielson, a 55-year-old tourist from New Zealand, said of the new Sentosa line: “I think it is a great way to travel around the island... Personally, my wife and I prefer to walk around the island, but I have been on the cable cars a few times. It was great fun, and we could see everything.” — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T08:29:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
