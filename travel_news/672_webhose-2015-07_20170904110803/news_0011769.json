The Chicago, New York and St. Louis legs have been cancelled. \nRefunds will be available. No reason was given for the show's abrupt cancellation. \nIt's another black eye for co-producers Michael Cohl and Jeremiah J. Harris, whose \"Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark\" was a costly failure on Broadway. Hero Ventures, a Los Angeles-based entertainment company, and Marvel Entertainment also produced the tour. \nThe $30 million show had previously made stops in Phoenix, Dallas and San Diego before being retooled for the current run.
