This year’s expo has three Chinese projects: the China Pavilion; a pavilion by property developer Vanke; and the China Corporate United Pavilion, which has been jointly set up by a group of Chinese companies. Combined, they cover an area of 72,000 square feet. At the China Pavilion, exhibits focus on the country’s long food culture, telling stories from different regions and cities. One display includes clay figures of Chinese people eating and preparing food, or chatting around a dinner table, to show how food brings people together. These stories have been seamlessly incorporated into the structure’s design, which has a “wheat field” containing more than 20,000 steel and wooden stalks, each attached with remote-controlled LED lights that constantly change colour, giving a sense of growing crops. Bamboo tiles also cover the roof, to represent the annual harvest. Vicente Gonzalez Loscertales, secretary-general of the International Exhibitions Bureau, said China’s participation in world expos had progressed greatly over the years, adding particular praise for the influential 2010 Shanghai Expo. He said the design of the China Pavilion in Milan was a perfect showcase of tradition and modernity, central to China’s values. Carlo Calenda, Italian deputy minister for economic development, said China worked closely with Italy in food and agriculture, and both countries believed food is not just about eating, but is an important part of life. The theme for the China Corporate United Pavilion was “Seeds of China”. Drawing on the symbolism of the seed, the pavilion represents the dream of the Chinese companies that want to go global and engage with partners internationally. The structure has three display sections. One focuses on companies that are inseparable from daily life in China, such as those related to food, clothing and transport, while another highlights companies in high-end manufacturing and technology, which echoes the essence of the world’s fair, to showcase innovative industrial breakthroughs. In the third section, visitors can watch an animated movie that uses pandas to tell the story of the desire among Chinese companies to go global. Near the ground-floor entrance is a shop that sells Chinese desserts, teas and small artworks, and people can also buy an “expo passport” that can be stamped at each pavilion they visit. Wang Hui, the project’s executive director, said the pavilion represented the largest collection of Chinese companies to exhibit at an expo outside China, and was in line with the Chinese government’s encouragement for companies to go global. The Chinese economy is already integral to the global economy. We don’t just want to exhibit companies, we want to help companies find the right international business partners “We hope the seed theme will show that the best Chinese companies in their industries will grow in the global market and become globally competitive firms, like big trees that grow from seeds,” he said. “Some smaller companies may not have such high ambitions, so we hope they will still grow, like grass, to support the bigger Chinese firms.” Wang said the pavilion design, with each section linked by a spiral walkway, was based on the idea of a seed growing and blossoming. Some of the enterprises involved already have a presence outside China, through both growth and acquisitions, so it made sense for them to make their brands better known to a global audience, he added. One company, Bright Food, has made numerous acquisitions overseas, including a majority stake in Salov, the Italian olive oil maker, in 2013. Another is Shanghai Electric, which bought a 40 per cent stake in Italian power engineering company Ansaldo Energia last year, and had plans to establish joint ventures to make gas turbines for Asian markets and set up a research and development centre in Shanghai. Also represented at the expo is Chinese drinks maker Jia Duo Bao, which sells herbal tea in scores of international markets, having successfully established a distribution network on various continents. “We don’t just give opportunities to the biggest Chinese firms, we also allow small food companies and Chinese gift producers to participate,” Mr Wang said. “For many of them, even the idea of one day participating in an international event like the expo was unimaginable. “The Chinese economy is already integral to the global economy. We don’t just want to simply exhibit companies, we really want to help companies find the right business partners so they can do more international business through the exhibition.” The China Corporate United Pavilion has organised a series of events before the Milan Expo closes on October 31, allowing companies to promote their image and, in the process, enhance cultural exchanges. On the schedule was an Italian wine-tasting contest, as well as a competition for artists to paint their interpretation of Chinese companies and the pavilion. Mr Wang said setting up the pavilion was a challenge because it was the first one organised overseas by Chinese companies. Selecting the most-representative companies to demonstrate the strength of Chinese enterprises was a key challenge, he said, as was linking up the wide variety of displays in a coherent way. Events manager Zhuo Yalan said displays would promote different cities and regions over the course of the expo, while the pavilion had set up an e-commerce platform that allows trading in all kinds of products between Chinese and international users. She predicted the pavilion would help boost the impact of several thousand companies. To lighten the business-heavy atmosphere, there would also be events to highlight traditional and modern Chinese culture, such as dance performances and fashion shows, he said. Zhou Xiaoming, brand manager for Shanghai Electric, said he believed the pavilion was a great venue for companies to spread their message to a global audience. “Right now, the Chinese high-speed railway and infrastructure sectors are rapidly going global, and as a supplier of these industries Shanghai Electric will also increasingly engage in international projects,” he said. In addition, as a supplier to China’s nuclear and wind power sectors, the company’s technology was already consistent with the highest global standards, he added. “We are already well-known by industry experts, but we would like to be well- known to a wider audience.” Airaldo Piva, European managing director of Hengdian Group, the Chinese conglomerate, said during a visit to the expo garden that, with the combined efforts of the three pavilions, he believed China would be highly prominent at the expo. “It will be a chance for the world to learn more about China,” he said.
