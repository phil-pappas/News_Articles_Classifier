(Ellen Creager/Detroit Free Press/TNS) Published: July 16, 2015 \nUtah's Zion National Park is a spiritual place. A glorious place. A place of serene ocher mountains and leaning narrow canyons. \n\"People are coming not only to tour the park but to nourish themselves,\" says Harriet Killshorse, owner of a local antiques shop, who has lived amid the enviable scenery for 25 years. \"You can't help but feel the mountain spirits.\" \nAs Zion National Park's popularity rises, those spirits may be feeling a bit crushed and crowded these days. But Zion is coping. \n\"We are having severe issues with parking,\" says park ranger Jamie Mansfield. \"We have to figure out how not to love the place too much.\" \nWhen America's naturalists and lawmakers began designating national parks, the idea was to preserve beautiful places for future generations. In 1903, artist Frederick Dellenbaugh's painting of Zion's ravishing loveliness was displayed at the St. Louis World's Fair, prompting people back east to marvel and officials to name it a national monument in 1909, and in 1919, a congressional bill designating Zion National Park was signed into law. \nWith its towering sandstone cliffs and slot canyons shaped over the millenia by the winding Virgin River, Zion is one of the nation's busiest national parks. This year, an 18 percent jump in visitors through May puts it on pace for 3.6 million visitors in 2015 -- 1 million more than in 2006. The visitor center parking lot is full by 10 a.m. A system of park and town shuttles is efficient but can get overwhelmed. \nOne thing protecting Zion's treasures? The far-sighted decision in 1997 to ban cars in Zion Canyon from March 15 to Oct. 25. You either have to take a shuttle or hike. \nYet, solitary contemplation of nature's beauty can still be had at Zion, which sprawls over 229 acres. You just have to look harder to find it. \nOne morning on the Emerald Pools Trail, waterfalls spill from above as visitors stroll below, gripping an iron railing fastened to rock. Because Zion is in oft-parched southwest Utah, visitors expect arid conditions. But the microclimate of Zion and its meandering Virgin River creates lush, green areas flush with ferns, columbines and cottonwood trees. \nI meet Sherry Schmidt, her husband and twin 11-year-old daughters. The family is trying to see highlights of Zion in just two days as part of a sightseeing circuit. They've just left arid Arches and Canyonlands National Parks and are enjoying the green of Zion. \n\"The parks are all very different,\" Schmidt says, pausing at a lookout that encompasses Zion Canyon from a bird's-eye view. \"But you can see how they are all connected.\" \nZion's most famous sights include Emerald Pools and the Narrows, a water-filled slot canyon that, at points, is only 20 feet wide. Zion's most famous hike is Angel's Landing, a not-for-the-faint-of-heart trek with precarious drop-offs. The park's most famous vista may be the Court of the Patriarchs, three peaks that reminded early visitors of three biblical figures: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. \nBut Zion also is special because of its American Indian roots, from ancient Pueblo settlers to the Paiute, says Killshorse. Her husband is Kiowa Native American. Their Springdale antiques and Indian trading post, about a mile from the park gates, is called Frontier Plunder. \nNo matter how many people pile into the park, it will remain steady, she predicts. Zion's ancient mountains have patiently endured generations of eager tourists, skilled climbers, foolish hikers, disrespectful louts and solace-seekers \nZion \"amplifies spirits, both good and bad. We often do ceremonies to protect the visitors, that they not harm Mother Nature or themselves,\" she says. \n\"For us, this is a metaphysical place.\" \n\nGetting there \nZion National Park is a 3-hour drive and 160 miles northeast of Las Vegas. It is 300 miles south of Salt Lake City. The park has two entrances, the main Zion Canyon entrance in Springdale, and the Kolub Canyon entrance 45 miles north. Lodging \nThe Zion Park Lodge within the park has some limited availability for summer, about $209 per night ( www.zionlodge.com ). Just outside park gates, Springdale has many clean, decent hotels (for a list, see www.zionpark.com ) including Hampton Inn & Suites and Holiday Inn Express (both about $200 per night in season.) \nZion Park entry fee: As of July 1, vehicle entry is $30; pedestrians are $15. Entry ticket is good for 7 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:13:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
