They greet you on almost every street – from the utterly iconic (the elegant metallic curves of the Eiffel Tower) and the splendidly sophisticated (the wide, sloping glory of the Champs Elysées) to the less-known (Porte Saint-Denis in the 10th arrondissement – a 17th century triumphal arch built by Louis XIV that is every bit as impressive as its more eulogised Napoleonic sibling) and the darkly disturbing (the skull-filled subterranean catacombs). But there is one famous site in Paris which falls short of the glory of these monuments and attractions – a corner of the French capital which, should you venture due east of the centre to view it, can only leave you feeling disappointed. Not least because it is, by some considerations, the most important location in the country; the place where the modern France threw off its medieval shackles and started out on the route towards democracy – and yet somehow manages to be bereft of any real notes of interest or excuses to linger. Place de la Bastille is the dampest of damp squibs. A sputtering firework left out in the rain. Bastille Day may have painted July 14 onto the French calendar in bright tricolore stripes, but Place de la Bastille has nothing of the colour or spark of France’s annual celebration of nationality. The first time I paid it a visit – in the days before GPS and Google allowed us to know our precise locations at all moments – I had to check my map several times to make sure that I had arrived at my intended destination. That destination being, of course, the spot where the French Revolution was ignited by the storming of the Bastille, and the path of European history – Bourbon royalty losing their heads to the guillotine; Napoleon emerging from the power vacuum – went off at a radical tangent. You would think that the location of such drama would remember it in a suitable fashion. But no. Your first reaction on reaching Place de la Bastille will probably be to waft away the exhaust fumes which belch from the ceaseless flow of cars that streams around what is, in effect, a vast roundabout, wedged where the 4th, 11th and 12th arrondissements meet. The second may well be the impulse to turn on your heels and retrace your steps. If you have approached the square from the classical heart of Paris, you will probably have wandered south-east through the gilded, boutique-lined streets of the Marais, and perhaps strolled across one of the city’s finest urban spaces – the Place des Vosges. This is a hugely pretty, tree-filled Parisian pocket, where a statue of Louis XIII rears on horseback and a covered arcade runs around the edge, sheltering the doorways to grand properties where the powerful and revered once lived – political mastermind and scheming villain (at least if you believe the way he is portrayed every time Hollywood coughs up another dreary Three Musketeers film) Cardinal Richelieu at number 21; Victor Hugo at number six. Only 500 metres separate the Place des Vosges from Place de la Bastille – but there is a reasonable chance that, on arriving in the latter, you will decide to retreat to the former. Of course, it is not Place de la Bastille’s fault that the cause of its fame is also the reason it is such an underwhelming spectacle. The revolutionaries of 1789 did their job too well. Both history and those who led the charge towards a French republic overplayed the significance of the Bastille as an emblem of tyranny. True, it was a state prison, where enemies of the regime had been held since 1417. But when the mob forced its way inside on July 14 1789, they found only seven prisoners. Still, the symbolism was too potent to resist. The Bastille represented the heavy-handedness of royal rule. It had to be destroyed. And so it was pulled down over the ensuing year – and had all but vanished by July 1790. Two centuries on, the disconnection between the square and its seismic importance to France is underlined by the only two landmarks which catch the eye. The first, the noble pillar which rears in the middle (the “July Column”) is a tribute to revolutionary fervour – but not the first flush of revolution which tore down the Bastille. Instead, it refers to the July Revolution of 1830, when France, having restored its monarchy in 1815, disposed of it for a second time. The other, the Opera Bastille is a clunky modern structure which – though the performances within are of the highest quality – is an acquired architectural taste. Opened in 1989 as part of former president Francois Mitterand’s ‘Grands Travaux’ project of new structures, its shares its DNA with the Grand Arche de la Defense on the other side of the city, but looks jarringly out of kilter with the Marais district that it abuts. And that, for Place de la Bastille, is largely that. However, if you wish to see something of the once mighty jail whose destruction changed a nation, you can amble half a mile south-west towards the Seine, where a small cluster of stones which formed part of the Bastille foundations – unearthed during the creation of the Paris metro in 1899 – are marooned at the junction of Boulevard Henri IV and Quai des Celestins. Alternatively, you can find echoes of the French Revolution in the following corners of this fine city… Five sites of revolutionary Paris Place de la Concorde Paris’s largest square (21 acres in total) – pitched at the south-east end of the Champs Elysées – was, of course, the scene of the French Revolution’s official bloodletting. Christened Place Louis XV when it was inaugurated in 1755, it was renamed “Place de la Revolution” as France embraced republicanism. Louis XVI was executed in the square on January 21 1793. The infamous guillotine stood in its northern corner, roughly outside what is now, by complete contrast, the decidedly refined and composed Hotel de Crillon. Pont de la Concorde The bridge which runs off the south side of Place de la Concorde was already under construction when the Revolution took hold in July 1789. It was completed in 1791 – some of its structure made of stone blocks retrieved from the demolition of the Bastille. The Louvre Now (arguably) the world’s finest art gallery (0033 1 4020 5317; louvre.fr ; €15), the Louvre was the French monarch’s main residence until the late 17th century. In 1648, the Fronde riots saw a Parisian mob break into the palace, and into the bedchamber of Louis XIV – then a nine-year-old minority king, who feigned sleep until the intruders retreated. The incident affected the boy, and was a contributing factor in his later commissioning of the Palace of Versailles, which shifted the French royal court 15 miles south-west of the capital, and helped to dislocate the French king from his people. Louis moved in in 1682. Palace of Versailles The French monarchy was cocooned in its enclave of luxury and ornate gardens when the Revolution broke out. Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were removed from the palace on October 6 1789. The Petit Trianon – the pastoral estate within the grounds where the queen used to play – has become seen as a symbol of the royal family’s distance from the harsh economic realities which sparked the crisis. It is still there as part of a palace which revels in royal pomp over two centuries on (0033 1 3083 7800; chateauversailles.fr ; €18). Musée Carnavalet This intriguing museum (0033 1 4459 5858; carnavalet.paris.fr ; €9), in the Marais, is dedicated to the history of Paris. It covers the Revolution with exhibits including some of Marie Antoinette’s possessions, and portraits of key players like Danton and Robespierre.
