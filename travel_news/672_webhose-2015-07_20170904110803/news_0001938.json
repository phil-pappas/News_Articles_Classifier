Total consideration includes $75 million in cash and 200,000 warrants at an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The closing of the acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions. \nTransaction highlights include: Brands anticipated to add approximately $28 million in 2014 annualized GAAP revenues to The ONE Group revenues and approximately $55 million in 2014 annualized total food and beverage sales in owned, managed and licensed units*. Adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis of approximately $14.9 million in 2014, up from $7.8 million as originally reported by the Company. Acquisition includes four Katsuya locations in Los Angeles that are company-owned and operated. The ONE Group will receive license fees from the two managed Katsuya locations in SLS Hotels in Las Vegas and Miami and from two additional managed locations, one expected to open in the SLS Lux at Baha Mar in the Bahamas and the other expected to open in the SLS Lux Brickell in Miami. Licensing agreement with Alshaya for the Middle East which includes three Katsuya restaurants in the Middle East with a commitment by Alshaya to open an additional 14 locations in the region over the next 5 years.

The new restaurant brands will increase our portfolio of one, two and three meal a day restaurants for our hotel partners to choose from as part of our hotel food and beverage program.

Pending the completion of the transaction, our pro forma 2014 Adjusted EBITDA** would have been approximately $14.9 million, up from $7.8 million as originally reported by us, by combining the Katsuya and Cleo brands with our restaurant and hospitality businesses, while leveraging our global infrastructure,” said Jonathan Segal, CEO of The ONE Group. “This deal will be both incredibly synergistic, since the existing domestic restaurants are in markets we currently operate in, as well as additive to our growth, as it will open up geographic expansion into the Middle East. Further, the acquisition will allow us to take the Katsuya and Cleo brands into existing STK markets and gives us a great opportunity to expand all of our brands into new SLS and Redbury hotels in the future – providing additional potential avenues for the growth of our hospitality business moving forward.” \n“The transaction allows us to form a unique partnership with The ONE Group. While we are selling them the Katsuya and Cleo restaurant brands, we really view this as a great opportunity to grow these brands in partnership, by seeking to incorporate them at many of our planned SLS, Redbury and Hyde hotel properties in the future. We’ve watched The ONE Group expand globally and we believe they truly understand how to operate high-energy restaurant concepts and they share our passion for creating unique hospitality experiences. We look forward to a great working partnership with The ONE Group and the opportunity to scale these brands globally,” said Founder, Chairman and CEO, Sam Nazarian of SBE. \nKatsuya \nKatsuya by Starck pairs Master Sushi Chef Katsuya Uechi’s fresh takes on Japanese classics with design icon Philippe Starck’s sleek and sultry interiors in a unique sushi restaurant.

Total food and beverage sales at owned, managed and licensed units represents total revenue from owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at managed and licensed locations, where we earn management, license and/or incentive fees at these locations. We believe that this measure represents a useful internal measure of performance as it identifies total sales associated with our brands and hospitality services that we provide. We believe that this measure also represents a useful internal measure of performance. Accordingly, we include this non-GAAP measure so that investors can review financial data that management uses in evaluating performance, and we believe that it will assist the investment community in assessing performance of restaurants and other services we operate, whether or not the operation is owned by us. However, because this measure is not determined in accordance with GAAP, it is susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, this measure as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled measure presented by other companies. \nThe following table includes a reconciliation of Katsuya/Cleo 2014 unaudited GAAP revenue to 2014 total food and beverage sales at owned, managed and licensed units: TOTAL KATSUYA AND CLEO FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:37:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
