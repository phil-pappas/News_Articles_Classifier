No, it’s not the Cheers bar, but it can be compared to the famous television establishment in the sense that after you eat at the cozy café a handful of times, you begin to feel like family.\nIt’s a restaurant that many people in New York identify as their veritable, “spot.” They come back night after night, brunch after brunch, to enjoy the food and really soak up the incredibly warm and welcoming ambience.\nThe owners, Dean and Maya Jankelowitz, are a husband-and-wife team, and they have single-handedly adopted many of the city’s full-grown adults as their own children, serving up beautiful and hearty American-Mediterranean food to warm their bellies and their souls.\nIn our second installment of Family Meals from around the world, shot in collaboration with Henry Hargreaves , we visited Dean to find out how his staff enjoys their daily family meal.\nPhoto: Henry Hargreaves\nOpening Jack’s Wife Freda\nWe wanted to open a place that was a café—or what we knew a café to be. A place with breakfast, lunch, and dinner that you could go any time of the day, not necessarily just during mealtime, and enjoy your food with a great cup of coffee or a glass of wine. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or celebration.\nWe wanted our restaurant to be a place that really added something to the existing community. Jack and Freda were my grandparents. That’s how the name came to be; it just shot into my mind. So we went with Jack’s Wife Freda. The menu was put together with dishes we loved, and it’s been fantastic.\nSee More: Nikki Huganir & Erica Blumenthal\nSolo Dining\nI found that when we had family meal and everyone sat together, it just became a lazy hangout session. I’ve worked in restaurants my entire life. I truly appreciated when I could sit down and actually enjoy a meal and observe what was going on around me in peace. Restaurants are such a chaotic environment, so I always valued the fact that I could sit alone and take some private time. I could enjoy the restaurant almost like a customer.\nPhoto: Henry Hargreaves\nOff the Menu\nBecause our staff can order whatever they like, it gives them the opportunity to try different foods or experiment with the menu…taste a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It also humanizes the experience—that it’s not just a huge pasta or salad. Everybody has different tastes and dietary restrictions, so the fact that they can order off of the menu really allows them to stick with their own preferences. They can truly experience the menu however they like. The portions are also exactly the same as the customers receive.\nFamily to Menu\nOur most popular dishes have been a result of our staff meals. The Mediterranean Breakfast , for example, came to be because one of our former waitresses would order all of the little sides for her family meal—a side of eggs, a side of labneh, salad, some pita bread—and it ended up becoming the “Mediterranean Breakfast.” The spaghetti squash also ended up on the menu because we had some vegetarians working with us, so they put that together. And the same with the grain bowl, thanks to a group of vegan employees playing around with the menu.\nPhoto: Henry Hargreaves\nThe Logistics\nWe have five to six people each shift. Everyone gets a chance to sit down whether it’s toward the beginning or toward the end. Depending on the pace of the restaurant, everyone gets between 20 and 25 minutes.\nBoss Meals\nDean’s favorite staff meal:\nI eat the Peri Peri Chicken six nights a week.\nMaya’s favorite staff meal:\nMaya plays around with the menu a lot more. She tries the salads and the egg dishes a lot. Occasionally she has the steak.\nSee More: Elizabeth Stewart\nThe Human Experience\nI think our family meal really humanizes the whole job for our staff. They get to order like customers, sit down and enjoy the food, and experience the restaurant with a different perspective. It’s a nice little moment. Unwind and relish the meal.\nPhoto: Henry Hargreaves\nOwning a Restaurant\nMy favorite thing about owning our restaurants is being able to create something and be a part of it at the same time. It’s been a fantastic experience truly watching something grow.\nStaff:\nDean and Maya Jankelowitz, Owners\nLakis Pavlou, Bartender\nJovanni Flores, Food runner\nAlexandra Sheenan, Server\nJessica Landucci, Manager\nFollow Jack’s Wife Freda on Instagram here!\nSee More: Whitney Tingle & Danielle DuBoise\nPhoto: Henry Hargreaves", "external_links": ["http://www.thefood-life.com/professionals/mind-body-connection/", "http://www.thefood-life.com/side-dishes/tales-fridge-3/", "http://www.thefood-life.com/professionals/family-meal/", "https://instagram.com/jackswifefreda/?hl=en", "http://henryhargreaves.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://www.thefood-life.com/side-dishes/yes-way-rose/", "http://jackswifefreda.com/", "http://jackswifefreda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JWF_MenuLUNCH-WEB14.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-01T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:00:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
