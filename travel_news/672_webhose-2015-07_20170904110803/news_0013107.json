We also continue to be pleased with the initial results at our two recent acquisitions, the Royal Palm and the Ace Hotel and Theater, which further give us confidence to increase our quarterly common share dividend by 14%.” \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS \nThe following is a summary of the consolidated financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in millions, except share and per share amounts): Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2015 Net income available to common shareholders $ Net income per diluted common share $ AFFO available to common shareholders $ AFFO per diluted common share $ Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 58,956,483 \nHOTEL OPERATING RESULTS \nManagement assesses the operating performance of its hotels irrespective of the hotel owner during the periods compared using the following key operating metrics: occupancy, ADR, RevPAR, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin. The Trust uses the term \"pro forma\" to refer to metrics that include, or comparisons of metrics that are based on, the operating results of hotels under previous ownership for either a portion of or the entire period. As of June 30, 2015, the Trust owned 22 hotels. Since two of its hotels owned as of June 30, 2015 were acquired during 2015 and another one was acquired in October 2014, the key operating metrics below reflect the pro forma operating results for those hotels for all, or a certain period, of the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. \nIncluded in the following table are comparisons of the key operating metrics for the 22-hotel portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except for ADR and RevPAR): Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30, 2015 (1) Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin 36.4 (1) Includes results of operations for certain hotels prior to their acquisition by the Trust. \nHotel EBITDA, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin, Corporate EBITDA, Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, FFO, FFO available to common shareholders and AFFO available to common shareholders are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. See the discussion included in this press release for information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. \nACQUISITION ACTIVITY \nOn April 30, 2015, the Trust acquired the 182-room Ace Hotel and Theater Downtown Los Angeles located in Los Angeles, California for $101.7 million, including acquired working capital.

The updated outlook assumes no additional acquisitions, dispositions, or financing transactions (in millions, except RevPAR and per share amounts): Net income available to common shareholders $ Net income per diluted common share $ AFFO available to common shareholders $ AFFO per diluted common share $ Corporate cash general and administrative expense $ Corporate non-cash general and administrative expense $ Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 59.0 Pro forma RevPAR increase over 2014 (1) 6.5 Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin increase over 2014 (1) 175 bps (1) The comparable 2014 period includes results of operations for certain hotels prior to their acquisition by the Trust. Net income available to common shareholders $ Net income per diluted common share $ AFFO available to common shareholders $ AFFO per diluted common share $ Corporate cash general and administrative expense $ Corporate non-cash general and administrative expense $ Weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding 57.9 Pro forma RevPAR increase over 2014 (1) 6.5 Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA $ Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin 32.8 Pro forma Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin increase over 2014 (1) 140 bps (1) The comparable 2014 period includes results of operations for certain hotels prior to their acquisition by the Trust. \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \nThe Trust reports the following eight non-GAAP financial measures that it believes are useful to investors as key measures of its operating performance: (1) Hotel EBITDA, (2) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, (3) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin, (4) Corporate EBITDA, (5) Adjusted Corporate EBITDA, (6) FFO, (7) FFO available to common shareholders and (8) AFFO available to common shareholders. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included in the accompanying financial tables. \nHotel EBITDA – Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, air rights amortization, corporate general and administrative, and hotel acquisition costs. The Trust believes that Hotel EBITDA provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of the Trust’s capital structure (primarily interest), the Trust’s asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and the Trust’s corporate-level expenses (corporate general and administrative and hotel acquisition costs). \nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA – The Trust further adjusts Hotel EBITDA for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides investors with another useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance, excluding the effect of these non-cash items. \nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin – Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted Hotel EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. The Trust believes that Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin provides investors another useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s hotel operating performance. \nCorporate EBITDA – Corporate EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Trust believes that Corporate EBITDA provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance, excluding the impact of the Trust’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and the Trust’s asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). \nAdjusted Corporate EBITDA – The Trust further adjusts Corporate EBITDA for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including air rights contracts, ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items, and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, which is a non-recurring item. The Trust believes that Adjusted Corporate EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods. \nFFO – The Trust calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding depreciation and amortization, impairment charges of depreciable real estate, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. By excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization and gains (losses) from sales of real estate, both of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, the Trust believes that FFO provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance. \nFFO available to common shareholders – The Trust reduces FFO for preferred share dividends and dividends declared on and earnings allocated to unvested time-based awards (consistent with adjustments required by GAAP in reporting net income available to common shareholders and related per share amounts). FFO available to common shareholders provides investors another financial measure to evaluate the Trust’s operating performance after taking into account the interests of holders of the Trust’s preferred shares and unvested time-based awards. \nAFFO available to common shareholders – The Trust further adjusts FFO available to common shareholders for certain additional recurring and non-recurring items that are not in NAREIT’s definition of FFO. Specifically, the Trust adjusts for hotel acquisition costs and non-cash amortization of intangible assets and liabilities, including air rights contracts, ground lease assets and unfavorable contract liabilities, deferred franchise costs, and deferred key money, all of which are recurring items. The Trust believes that AFFO available to common shareholders provides investors with another financial measure of its operating performance that provides for greater comparability of its core operating results between periods. \nCONFERENCE CALL \nThe Trust will host a conference call on Thursday, July 30, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results.
