Though she plans on doing things a little differently next time. \n\"My first trip wasn't exactly glamorous; it was just four girlfriends and I in a beaten up, old van, but I fell in love with the Rockies and have been dying to get back ever since. On my next trip, I'll be swapping the van for a seat in GoldLeaf on board the Rocky Mountaineer train . \n\"You're constantly looking up when you travel along the Icefields Park so it makes sense to see the stunning alpine landscape unfold before your eyes within their glass-dome train carriage. The luxury service is just a bonus!\" \nThe journey is particularly popular with her customers, and she's found that many aren't waiting until later in life to embark on these ultimate journeys. \n\"Canada and Alaska are not as expensive as many people initially think. Many of my clients aren't waiting until their older years to travel. You never really know what's around the corner so you've got to see the world while you can.\" \nHer next dream holidays include an African safari with her young family, as well as the ultimate South American adventure - trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu . \nVisit your local Flight Centre store to book your own Americas adventure.
