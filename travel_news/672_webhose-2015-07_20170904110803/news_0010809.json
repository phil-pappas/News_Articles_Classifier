Passengers can collect CashPoints from the very first trip and claim them against any forthcoming long-haul or short-haul flight, even during peak travel periods. Members can also use CashPoints to get attractive rates on hotels and rental cars from a wide range of suppliers.\nBrede Huser, VP Norwegian Reward at Norwegian, said: “We are seeing increasing numbers of Norwegian Reward members gain the benefits of flying with us by taking advantage of their CashPoints. We now have over three million members and the level of loyalty shown by our customers strongly indicates that we are delivering excellent travel experiences. As such, the enhanced Norwegian Reward programme will help reduce costs and deliver great value for Reward members.\n“With multiple daily flights from London to key European and US destinations including our new, upcoming services to San Juan and Boston, we expect frequent business and leisure customers to make their CashPoints work for them.”\nNorwegian Reward members who fly 12 round trips between 1 July and 31 December 2015 can now receive one long-haul flight entirely for free.\nSource:- Norwegian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:12:50.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
