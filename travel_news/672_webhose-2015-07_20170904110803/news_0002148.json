Also, being lumped with last minute Excess Baggage Charges places undue stress upon travelers and having to unpack and re-arrange personal belongings, discard treasured souvenirs in full view of others in the queue, can be not only highly embarrassing but is very upsetting for people.\nTravellers can now accurately calculate not only the weight of luggage, but they can also measure the size of Carry-On bags with one pocket size device, the Pocketsize Digital luggage scale, thereby avoiding unnecessary delays and additional expenses at the Check- In counter. All Expert Traveler Accessories are backed by a One Year Warranty.\n\"The company, which is family owned and operated, is committed to providing an excellent level of service to all of our valued customers whilst supplying quality, innovative tools, designed to enhance the travel experience for all\", said Rose. \"We want our customers to be totally satisfied with our products and be happy to refer us to their family and friends\"\nAbout Expert Traveler Accessories\nExpert Traveler Accessories is a leading global supplier of high quality travel accessories. The newly designed Digital Luggage Scale has just been released onto the market. \"We pride ourselves in delivering exceptional service to all our valued customers and we are very excited about adding this quality accessory to our range\", stated company representative Rose Ilton.\nContact\nRose\n456-358-999\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
