The Haunted Mansion is a classic attraction at Magic Kingdom and a great way to beat the heat after after making into the mansion. (Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda, Orlando Sentinel) How to get a little cool at Orlando's big theme parks \nYes, it is hot enough for me. Thanks for asking. \nIt's OK. Over the years, I've learned to cope, even at Central Florida's broiling-hot theme parks. But sometimes even my Tyra Banks-paraphrased motto of \"Find Your Shade\" isn't enough. You must go indoors for real relief. Caption Places in Magic Kingdom to stay cool Caption 1. Space Mountain Matt Mauney, Orlando Sentinel \nLocated in Tomorrowland, Space Mountain is one of the most popular rides at Magic Kingdom, but it is also one of the coolest. While standby wait times might be long, you will mostly be waiting in the cool inside queue, winding through the line until you reach the launching platform and experience the indoor roller coaster in a chilly yet pleasant environment. \nLocated in Tomorrowland, Space Mountain is one of the most popular rides at Magic Kingdom, but it is also one of the coolest.

(Matt Mauney, Orlando Sentinel) See more galleries \nMy favorite cool-down spot is well-established. I like to sit on the frigid, bare floor of Epcot's American Adventure. If the Voices of Liberty are there, well, that's just gravy. I've been known to spread out flat on that floor when there aren't many other guests around. It's not dignified, but it's so, so, so soothing. \nI've made how-to-cool-down lists before, so this year I asked a few of my park-going colleagues where they like to hang during hot spells. I was a little surprised that it was so Epcot-heavy. Among their suggestions: \n•The Club Cool shop in Future World. There are lots of beverages to try there, too, but the limited seating is a challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:17:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
