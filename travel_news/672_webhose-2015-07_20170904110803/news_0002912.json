Through this strategic partnership, Alibaba Group and Unilever China will work together to: Strengthen cooperation to expand distribution channels, especially for consumers in rural areas to enjoy more convenient access to Unilever products Further develop cross-border ecommerce cooperation and make the Tmall Global Unilever store home to the richest selection of Unilever products from around the world Expand application of Big Data to optimize Unilever's digital advertising strategy through Alimama, Alibaba's online marketing business, and reach more consumers through online-offline retail integration Deepen collaboration in Alibaba's Blue Star program where each product is tagged with a unique QR code that allows the consumer to verify its authenticity and origin. This will help protect Unilever's brand and combat counterfeit goods to protect the customer user experience Develop innovations in supply chain management and offline distribution models The upcoming Unilever Week on Tmall, scheduled for July 22 to 24, will celebrate the start of this partnership agreement. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T07:11:12.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
