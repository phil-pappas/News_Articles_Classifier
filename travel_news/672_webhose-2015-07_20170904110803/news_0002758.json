The drone came within 100 metres (330 feet) of the Embraer plane when the Munich to Warsaw flight was at a height of about 760 metres, the airline and the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency (PANSA) said.\nPolice are investigating, a PANSA spokesman said.\nThe plane landed safely at 14:09 GMT, a Lufthansa spokeswoman said.\nPANSA changed landing directions for other planes until the area was clear, however police and military helicopters sent to the area did not spot the drone.\nThe Aviation Herald cited the Lufthansa pilots as telling air traffic controllers they \"should take care of your airspace\" and \"it is really quite dangerous\".\nWith the use of commercial drones for applications from filming to sports events and agriculture booming, the European Union is working on new regulations for drones to protect the safety and privacy of its citizens.\nThe regulations are due to be presented in the autumn as part of the European Commission's new aviation package.\nAmong the few member states with specific regulations, Germany in June introduced new rules that prevent the use of drones within 1.5 km of airport perimeter fences.\nAnyone wanting to fly a drone beyond that exclusion zone and in controlled airspace must request permission from air traffic authorities and fly no higher than 50 metres, depending on the size of the aircraft.\nDrones caused alarm in France earlier this year when several flights were spotted operating over sensitive sites in Paris.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T23:05:59.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
