And no, it's not over a new contract with the carrier. In the wake of last week's announcement that United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) would launch a $3 billion stock repurchase effort, United pilots are seriously questioning the wisdom of that move by management of the Chicago-based airline. United operates one of its largest hubs at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport. In a strongly worded memo sent late last week to his fellow 12,500-plus unionized United pilots, Jay Heppner , a United captain and chairman of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association , wrote that \"buying back shares of a company's stock signals to investors that executive management cannot think of anything better to do with its excess cash.\" But United pilots have what they believe is a better idea. The pilots think management should be spending all — or a good chunk — of that cash on making United a better airline than it appears to be today on some key fronts. Heppner in his memo wrote that \"while all 84,000 employees of United Airlines are doing the best we can with the limited tools and training we receive, we continue to find ourselves too often apologizing to our customers for a merger and integration that, after more than five years, cannot yet be declared a success.\" The merger to which Heppner referred joined United Airlines and Continental to form what is now the world's second-largest airline. In his note, Heppner went on to outline some of the pilots' concerns about United's situation, including the carrier's ranking at or near the bottom among major domestic legacy carriers in recent J.D. Power airline satisfaction surveys. Heppner also noted that United's on-time arrival performance has lagged that of competitors such as Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines in recent months. And Heppner said he has witnessed operational delays at airports where he lands planes that continue to be cause for concern. In an interview, Heppner, who is on United's Board of Directors, said he was informed the airline intended to move forward with its stock repurchase plan two days before last Thursday's public announcement. Heppner maintains United management was aware of the pilots' stance on the stock buyback, but moved forward with its game plan nonetheless. A United spokeswoman said the airline would have no comment on Heppner's memo. \nWant Houston Travel   United Airlines pilots' are… more Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:55:09.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
