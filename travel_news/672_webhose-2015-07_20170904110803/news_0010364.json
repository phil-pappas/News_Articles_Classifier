Pictured are people queueing outside a Greek bank to withdraw cash from an ATM\nFears over queues at cash points, banking and security are putting many off travelling to the country.\nCamhis, whose company www.mygreek-villa.com has more than 250 villas for rent, said long-term bookings were not being cancelled but in the last three weeks new bookings had dried up.\n Mesmerising salt flats that look like abstract paintings:...

'Scariest landing in my entire life': Panic of passengers on... 14 shares But speaking from Greece last night he said fears were unfounded and life in the Greek islands remained as normal with cash machines working, petrol available and no change to normal life.\nVictor Camhis, owner of www.mygreek-villa.com, says fears over the Grexit were unfounded\nHe said people booking last minute could cash in on savings of up to 30 percent.\n'It's crazy but we still have availability in August. There are offers now and promotions and this is the best time to get a last-minute booking.\n'I had someone say to me they didn't want to go to Greece because they felt bad for the people.\n'But that's exactly why you should go, tourism provides about 20 percent of Greece's GDP so this is exactly the wrong time for us to be affected.\n'The overall hotel industry in Greece is losing last-minute bookings up to 5,000 a day for the months of July and August\n'Greece and the Greek islands are still an ideal place to make your last minute bookings in luxury villas with swimming pools or by the sea, with superb sea views, at affordable prices.\n'Despite the difficult economic situation, services are excellent, the tavernas and bars are always open, the antiquities are there and the sea is still the best in the Mediterranean.\n'The only advice one can give to tourists is to have some cash available with them, but most establishments, supermarkets, shops and the majority of restaurants accept credit cards.\n'Tourists can withdraw money from the automatic bank machines, as much as their bank card allows.\n'The only problem they might encounter is that the machine might not have banknotes available, especially in the evening. Most probably this particular problem will be resolved during the next week. We will keep our clients informed.\n'There are no problems of safety whatsoever. Tourists will enjoy the same feeling as they always had in the peaceful Greek islands.\n'We will get a solution to this problem, 75 percent of Greeks want to stay in the eurozone, we voted no against austerity.'\nYesterday Chancellor George Osborne warned that tourists should take enough medical supplies to last them for their holiday.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eBEixw"], "published": "2015-07-07T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:45:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
