CBME China 2015, taking place from 22 - 24 July, will fully occupy all 17 exhibition halls at the Shanghai New International Expo Centre (SNIEC), covering over 200,000 square metres of indoor gross space and reaching the maximum indoor capacity of the centre. The move to NECC in 2016 will enable CBME to expand considerably, allowing more and larger country and group pavilions such as those from the USA, UK, Spain, Italy, Australia, Korea, and Taiwan. \nJime Essink, President & CEO of UBM Asia, said: \"We are really pleased with the additional venue capacity in Shanghai as a result of the new NECC venue. This offers UBM Asia ample opportunity to grow our larger events in Shanghai, both in the SNIEC and NECC venues. Shanghai is definitely set to become the exhibition capital of the world. We are looking forward to a very successful CBME 2016 in the NECC venue.\" \nUBM's existing events at SNIEC are growing strongly as they cater to the increasing demand from a variety of industries. \nEssink added: \"We are very happy to see the continuous growth of our events at SNIEC. This year, we have moved Sign China, LED China and LED Lighting China fairs (16 - 19 September, 2015) from Guangzhou to Shanghai to open new doors and business opportunities for the industry. Shanghai with its international reputation, financial importance and business openness provides an ideal backdrop for these trade events. These truly international shows drew over 12,000 overseas buyers in 2014 and the location in Shanghai will attract even more this year. Current sales progress indicates that the 2015 event in Shanghai will be the largest ever edition in its 13 year history.\" \nThe China International Printing Industry Exhibition (CSTPF), acquired by UBM from SUNEXPO in January 2015, is another annual event that adds to UBM's growing portfolio in Shanghai. The fair, held from 14 - 16 April this year, occupied 11,500 square meters. \nShanghai will also see UBM's new launch of China Railway + Transit Exhibition and Conference in December 2015. CRTEC, co-located with Marintec China which has been held in Shanghai for more than 30 years serving the global shipbuilding industry, will help China realise its \"One Belt, One Road\" economic and infrastructure connectivity with the rest of the world. \nAnother exciting development is that of Hotelex Shanghai, organised by UBM Sinoexpo, a UBM joint venture company in Shanghai. Already one of the world's most important shows of its kind, specialising in all supplies required by the hospitality industry, Hotelex will be extended to two phases from 2017. In addition to the 200,000 square metres already leased in March 2017, SNIEC has confirmed a second 200,000 square metres slot in April 2017 for a second phase of this trade event. Hotelex Phase 1 will feature catering, tableware, food & beverages, coffee & tea, and food related products, while Phase 2 will focus on hotel supply, textile, IT & security, building & interior, furniture & accessory, vending machine, and cleaning. UBM Sinoexpo organises other major shows at SNIEC, namely CPhI/P-MEC China and Fi Asia-China which ran from 24 - 26 June 2015 with a record number of 3,500 exhibitors, and Furniture China which will be held from 9 - 12 September 2015, occupying all indoor and outdoor space at SNIEC plus all indoor space at the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition & Convention Centre which is also in Pudong. The total of 380,000 square metres gross will make Furniture China 2015 the largest ever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:15:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
