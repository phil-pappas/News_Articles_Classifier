While this has not yet happened, pundits have noted a lot of tyre-kicking, to borrow a term used by Variety in its Feb 3 issue. • Hollywood big shots target China movie market • Programme offers close-up of big screen’s glitterati Hunan TV & Broadcast Intermediary Co Ltd, an entertainment company based in central China, announced in March it had agreed a $1.5 billion deal with Lionsgate to co-finance all qualifying features made by the North American studio over the next three years. Beijing’s Huayi Brothers also has a three-year, 18-film deal with STX, a company partly invested in by the Chinese fund Hony Capital. Behind some Hollywood blockbusters are also Chinese moneymen who hold minority stakes: China Film Group reportedly had equity in Fast and Furious 7 and Seventh Son, while Alibaba Pictures is an investor in the fi fth instalment of the Mission Impossible franchise. Hollywood is always perceived as the Holy Grail... but it's a dangerous game So why are Chinese investors chasing a Hollywood dream when their backyard market is growing at a 35-per cent compound rate compared with a North American box office that shrank 5 per cent last year? For one thing, it is not an either-or option; many of these players are already deeply involved on the home front. For another, Hollywood is always perceived as the Holy Grail: It has more latitude in its choice of subject matter and global distribution and has higher recognition and cachet associated with it. Who would want to stop at number two when they have a chance — not to mention the financial wherewithal — to shoot for the top spot? But Hollywood is a dangerous game. Sony got burned when it bought Columbia Pictures in 1989, and it has become a cautionary tale. Wall Street did not like the idea of Jack Ma dabbling in show business When Jack Ma, the founder of Chinese Internet company Alibaba, descended on Tinseltown in October, it was rumoured he might cherry-pick Lionsgate or even one of the Big Six studios. When he came home empty-handed, there was a palpable sense of disappointment, or at least head-scratching. But not so on Wall Street. According to an industry insider who asked to remain anonymous, Wall Street did not like the idea of Ma dabbling in show business — glamorous as it is, it carries a much higher risk than e-commerce, especially the production side of the business. It seems Alibaba is seeking a side entrance. Yule Bao, the company’s crowd-funding platform, which allows ordinary Chinese to indirectly invest in Hollywood projects, attracted 7.1 million users in its fi rst year. Chinese stars in cameo roles speaking Mandarin or broken English in Hollywood franchises is more a source of embarrassment than one of pride According to Yule Bao, almost 60 per cent of users said they prefer Hollywood sci-fi films, 54 per cent said comedies, and 41 per cent said action movies. Although only one project for the initial period was a foreign film, most users (59 per cent) said they would rather invest in imported movies. Whatever Hollywood movies Yule Bao ends up backing, they will not likely be co-productions. China’s stringent rules for co-productions, which include the movie having a signifi cant proportion of Chinese content, have pushed out most projects partly financed by Chinese or tangentially featuring Chinese narratives. The parade of Chinese stars in cameo roles either speaking Mandarin or broken English in Hollywood franchises is seen in China more as a source of embarrassment than one of pride. ... if history is any indication, the biggest payback isn't only in the bottom line, but also in the intangible benefit of glamour While nobody has given up on the idea of co-production just yet — Kung Fu Panda 3 is anticipated to be exemplary in this aspect — going to Hollywood is now less about zigzagging into the Chinese market than about achieving the ultimate goal of global success. Since Chinese movies have difficulty in gaining a mainstream audience in the West, why not invest directly in projects with potential built in? In China, there is a love-hate attitude towards these moves. Some people hail them for putting China on the verge of taking Hollywood; others view them with suspicion, as Chinese money helping to bankroll foreign cultural products. Most Chinese investors talk about their Hollywood dream not in financial terms, but rather as if they were cultural evangelists So far, the government has not revealed its stance on this flow of mostly private money. As minority stakeholders, Chinese players obviously have little say in the choice of movies or their casting. But if history is any indication, the biggest payback is not only in the bottom line, but also in the intangible benefit of glamour. Most Chinese investors talk about their Hollywood dream not in financial terms, but rather as if they were cultural evangelists. They want to tell their Chinese story and, right now, only Hollywood has the secret formula of making such a story accessible to the entire world They want to tell their Chinese story and, right now, only Hollywood has the secret formula of making such a story accessible to the entire world. However, if Sony’s 26-year trajectory in Hollywood is any guide, they may be disappointed by the time they truly hold the purse strings to Hollywood mega-projects. Cash-rich as they may be, they might not want to rush into making China-themed movies, as that would be seen as knocking Hollywood studios down a peg, back to the level of Chinese studios.
