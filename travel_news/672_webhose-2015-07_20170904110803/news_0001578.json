However, J. Patrick Moore, King City’s former Civic Association manager, would like to help spread the word about the area’s public golf course. \n“Ron Sorensen had a vision back in the mid-1960s,” said Moore, “and that was to transform 50 acres at the base of Bull Mountain into an adults-only, 55+ community. So Ron helped craft the original plans for retirement homes to be built surrounding a golf course.” \nAs the community grew, additional single family homes and apartments on low maintenance lots were constructed, as well as several hundred townhouses and condominiums. \nMoore notes that visitors and residents from nearby communities may not realize the King City Golf Course facilities are open to everyone. Moore says the nine-hole, 2,200 square foot course is both fun and challenging. \n“It’s great for both the first-time golfer as well as those more experienced,” said Moore. “And, the course conveniently located from I-5 from both directions—only 15 minutes from Portland. Since the course is open from dawn to dusk seven days a week, it’s a terrific spot to come and play, and then head over to one of the nearby restaurants for a great meal.” \nMoore said the King City pro golf shop can supply guests with most everything they’ll need for a great game—from clubs and balls to snacks and golfing apparel. Store Manager Harold Washam, has over 20 years experience as a greens keeper and makes sure the shop is well stocked with both merchandise and personal tips. His staff reserve tee times, and offer private lesson and equipment rental options. \nTournaments at the course have helped raise important funds for local clubs and charitable foundations. The King City Civic Association works with the local Lions Club to hold an annual event on the course. Teams are eligible to schedule other special organized events as well. \nMembership in King City golf clubs is available for both the public and King City residents. The King City Women’s Club holds an annual “For the Cure” tournament and other golf-related social and competition activities throughout the year. \n“This place really is the area’s best kept secret,” said Moore, “because so many people passing by don’t realize they could be playing here too. They’ll focus on the community’s 55+ sign and think the course is private as well… but it’s not!” \nIf you go \nKing City Public Golf Course is located at 15355 SW Royalty Parkway, in King City, Oregon, 97224. Their hours vary slightly, with an earlier opening (at 7:00 a.m.) in summer than in winter (8:00 a.m.); both season closures are at dusk.
