British households are estimated to generate around 7.2 million tonnes of food waste a year The irony is that saving money in the kitchen is something that many of us strive to do – at least if the exponential rise in profits for budget supermarkets gleaned from middle-class shoppers is anything to go by.

Grate up the odd ends of cheese, mix with breadcrumbs and use as a savoury topping for pasta or stir into mash. 2. Stew leftover berries in a pan with a little sugar and use as the base for a fruit crumble. 3. More yoghurt than you can eat about to go out of date? Mix it with fresh berries and tip it over your breakfast cereal. 4. Take whatever leftover vegetables you have with a cheese or white sauce and top with a mixture of breadcrumbs, oats and grated cheese. 5. Blitz stale bread in your food processor and use the crumbs as a binder when you make burgers, a thickening agent for sauces and a protective coating to seal in flavour with chicken breasts. 6. Don’t bin limp lettuce leaves – you can give them a new lease of life by sitting them in iced water for 30 minutes. 7. No idea whether all those opened jars of dressings, sauces and pastes still safe to eat? Start using a marker pen to write on the label when it was opened so that you know how long you have to finish it up. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:53:36.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
