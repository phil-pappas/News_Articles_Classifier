Khao Phansa falls on the first day after the full moon of the eight lunar month, or on 31 July this year.\nLegend has it that when the Lord Buddha was travelling and spreading his teachings, it was traditional for ascetics to retire to retreats during the rainy season. This period was known as ‘vassa’ and was aimed at preventing crop damage during vital growing periods. During this time, monks stay within their temples for study and adhere strictly to the teachings of the Lord Buddha.\nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, TAT Acting Governor and Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “As usual, the annual Khao Phansa celebrations truly reflect the local traditions and strong beliefs in Buddhism of the Thai people. TAT cordially invites all tourists and travellers to witness some of Thailand’s unique festivals as well as immerse themselves in some delightful local customs that can’t be found elsewhere. In line with our ‘2015 Discover Thainess’ campaign, TAT is encouraging tourists and travellers to go beyond the traditional attractions and explore distinct customs and traditions in more local destinations; such as, the 12 hidden gems.”\nSource:-TAT\nRelated Posts Gravity Thailand 2014 presents Arcadia The Bangkok Landing – the First in Asia TAT 2015 Discover Thainess campaign unveiled in India TAT prepares celebration events for Songkran!
