This is only the beginning of what you’ll experience in Belize. \nLocated in Central America, Belize is approximately four hours from both New York City and Detroit, six hours from Seattle, five hours from Los Angeles, three hours from Dallas and two hours from Miami. \nMany people believe Belize to be an island, however it is a Central American country bordered by Mexico to the north, Guatemala to the south and west and the Caribbean Sea to the east. This mistaken impression is understandable though, given that one of the biggest draws to Belize is for its hundreds of “cayes” (islands, pronounced “keys”) dotted along a spectacular Barrier Reef, the second largest (behind Australia’s) in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:42:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
