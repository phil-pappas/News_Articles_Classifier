According to TDn2K's Black Box Intelligence Report, overall transient restaurant traffic dropped 1.7 percent in the second quarter. \nDinova's clients, which include more than one-third of America's highest-travel-spending companies, spend $3 billion on catering and dining annually. So far this year, Dinova has added more than 40 large corporations and hundreds of smaller companies â€“ which cumulatively spend more than $500 million on dining every year - to its client roster. Dinova's nationwide restaurant network includes more than 12,000 independent and chain restaurants, encompassing all price levels and cuisines. \nGBTA Revisions, Hotel Reports Foreshadow Positive Corporate Dining Traffic \nNew projections shared by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation support this trend identified by Dinova's statistical analysis of sales reports. Revised GBTA data projects overall U.S. corporate travel expenditures to jump nearly five percent over 2014 totals, surpassing $300 billion. Looking farther ahead, GBTA anticipates 2016 corporate spend increasing 5.4 percent to $319 billion. \nRestaurant owners should also be enthused by GBTA's revised corporate group travel outlook, which sees group trip volume growing nearly one percent this year and leaping more than three percent in 2016. \"Economic fundamentals remain strong,\" said GBTA executive director Michael McCormick. \"Business travel will continue to have positive momentum as we move toward 2016.\" \nOn the lodging front, TravelClick's Hotel Industry Outlook shows that advance hotel bookings for the year ahead are up more than three percent, even with average rates up nearly five percent. \n\"All the indicators regarding business dining and catering are positive for restaurants,\" said Vic Macchio, founder and CEO of Dinova.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:24:57.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
