Rapid urbanisation and changing demographics are leading to growing pressure on infrastructure and civic services. With the population of London growing at the rate of one full tube train every three days, we must deal with the significant implications of these changes on the planning for future transport systems, housing and services such as education and healthcare. Something about our approach to these challenges has to change, and quickly. Coupled with this, disruptive technologies are shaking up traditional business processes faster than ever before. This, though, represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Collectively, we need to manage the rising tide of urbanisation and ensure that new and existing cities remain liveable while becoming more resilient and more sustainable. The only way we can make cities smarter is by harnessing disruptive technologies and business processes, unlocking new ways to fundamentally change how we deliver civic services and develop more efficient ways to design, build and run urban infrastructure. So, the time has never been better for Telegraph Business Events to organise Britain's Smart Cities , a dive into the overarching challenges UK cities are facing; and how pioneering city leaders at home and abroad are embracing “smart city” concepts to drive economic development, better environmental outcomes and improved quality of life for citizens. I'm particularly impressed with the strong line-up of speakers the Telegraph has assembled. We need to manage the rise of urbanisation and ensure that new and existing cities remain liveable while becoming more resilient and sustainable We will hear from senior policy makers from national and local government about the importance of smart cities for the UK economy. The UK Government has been a champion for smart city capabilities, and through the help of organisations such as Innovate UK, the Future Cities Catapult and the HyperCat Consortium, we have an increasingly positive policy and regulatory environment. Delegates will have a chance to learn about successful pilot projects from the real world – not just the technology solutions that have been demonstrated, but what lessons have been learned about the impact on the bottom line. This is hugely important because, ultimately, smart city solutions must show clear returns on investment if we are to see their widespread adoption. Telegraph Business Events has a record of attracting senior thought leaders and decision makers as speakers and delegates, and Britain's Smart Cities will provide a unique opportunity to network with major city leaders and business figures from across the UK. Finally, while smart cities are about so much more than the technology, this event will provide some fascinating insights into the capabilities of the latest technology solutions. Technology is a means to an end, and it is the application of relevant technology to real-world problems (and the actionable insights that can be gained from real-time data and analytics), that is driving this revolution in thinking about cities as whole systems rather than a series of verticals. There is a growing momentum behind the smart city concept, and growing global competition among cities to attract increasingly mobile investment capital and talent. This discussion, then, is about making our cities more efficient, more resilient and more sustainable. But ultimately, it is also about making our cities attractive places to live and work.
