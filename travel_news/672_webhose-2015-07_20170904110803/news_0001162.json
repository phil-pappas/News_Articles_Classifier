On Monday, Gov. Jay Nixon signed Senate Bill 190 , an act that renews and makes permanent a sales tax funding public transportation in Missouri. Kansas City's half-cent sales tax provides about $35 million in annual funding for the KCATA, or about 40 percent of its $87 million annual budget. The bill was sponsored by Sen. Kiki Curls , D-Kansas City. \"This money is the lifeblood needed for connecting people to economic opportunity. It sets in place the foundation for building a seamless transit network tying the metro area together,\" KCATA CEO Joe Reardon said in a release. Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day Robbie Makinen , chairman of the KCATA's Board of Commissioners, said the money ensures area residents will not lose access to a vital public transportation service. \"This funding ensures that not only will we have a service that helps our residents get to work, to the doctor and to the store, but sets the stage for an interconnected regional transit system that helps people throughout our metro area,\" Makinen said in a release. The sales tax was established in 1971 and it allows Kansas City and St. Louis to impose up to a 1-cent sales tax to fund transit. St. Louis' tax was made permanent in 2003. Under Reardon's stewardship, the KCATA is carrying out a massive mission to remake itself as a regional transit agency . The KCATA is leading the way on the RideKC initiative and is adding more municipal transportation services to its purview. Within the last year, it has taken over management of both Johnson County Transit's The Jo and Independence's IndeBus services . \nWant Kansas City Travel news in your inbox?
