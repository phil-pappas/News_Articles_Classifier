But had it not been for the foresight of Curly Lambeau, a meat packing company and the local newspaper in 1919, the region’s only big claim to fame might have been as the toilet paper production capital of the world. \nThe storied, community-owned franchise has won many championships and has 23 members in the NFL Hall of Fame, including some of the league’s legends such as coach Vince Lombardi and soon, controversial quarterback Brett Favre. \nThe open-air stadium — fans rejected the idea of a roof, preferring instead to bond in the chilly Wisconsin air — is home to the largest souvenir shop in the league, which does a brisk business selling everything from Packers-branded stilettos to cookware for tailgating. Souvenirs might be all some fans get as tickets to games have been sold out for 55 years. \nNear the stadium, Green Bay’s Walk of Legends is a mile-long trail of 24 granite and steel statues celebrating the team’s history. The trail is a project of the local Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin, whose members were stars of some of the early Packers teams. \nThat trail wends past Brett Favre’s Steakhouse, where I tucked into a 22-oz ribeye steak after not feeling peckish enough for the 32-oz porterhouse recommended by my serve. The steakhouse is jammed with Favre trophies and memorabilia, and sometimes bitter fans who resent that after 16 years as a Green Bay hero, Favre ended his career with the hated rival Minnesota Vikings in 2010. \nBut time heals all and this year, Favre’s No. 4 is being retired and the most winning-est quarterback in NFL history is being inducted into the team’s hall of fame in downtown Green Bay. \nDowntown, about 5 km from the stadium, is home to the two-year-old Packers Heritage Trail, a free self-guided walking tour that tells the improbable story of tiny Green Bay having an NFL team and the community’s unparalleled devotion to it. The trail’s centrepiece is a plaza near a boardwalk running along the Fox River. The plaza features statues of five team legends. \nEven tourist attractions that have nothing to do with football bask in the Packers glow. \nThe Green Bay Botanical Garden, one of the largest in the Midwest, has been improved through the team’s community charitable foundation. The garden features a children’s area with “wetting zoo” and tree fort. \nSimilar family focused attractions abound in the area. \nThe National Railway Museum, one of the first established in the U.S., houses some of the most significant rolling stock in American history such as the Union Pacific 4017 Big Boy, the world’s largest steam locomotive. \nThe vintage Bay Beach Amusement Park has been entertaining visitors for over a century and includes the Zippin Pippin, one of the world’s oldest wooden roller coasters, which was moved to Green Bay from Memphis in 2010. When it was in Memphis, the Zippin Pippin was said to be Elvis Presley’s favourite. \nOutside the city, the NEW Zoo (the acronym stands for Northeastern Wisconsin) is home to 90 different species including a white alligator — and a zip line. \nNEED TO KNOW \n— Visitor information: greenbay.com . \n— Attractions: Lambeau Field tours, packers.com .
