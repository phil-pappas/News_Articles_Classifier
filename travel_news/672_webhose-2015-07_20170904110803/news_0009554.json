I have been doing some searches, but I need first-hand experience from some one who has travelled to Lakshadweep within past one year ! I am a budget traveller, so, all these queries to minimize my budget ! I am not planning to take a flight, but ferries to/from Kochi. So, here are some questions related to ferries ! 1) the SPORTS ferries seem to have fixed schedules and do not seem to have a drop and pick option. Either you take the whole package or you get nothing ! Is there any option by which I can travel from Kochi to LD by ferry and take the ferry back on its return date and the trip inbetween is how I decide ! I am asking this, because I easily have 8 days and the package only has 4 days. They can't be customised. 2) Are there any cheaper ferries ? I read it somewhere that you can travel by smaller ferries which may take upto 24 hours, but are cheaper. Are they safe ? How do I book ? Tell me the cheapest ferry option please. Is it possible to go to Kochi and enquire about the cheap private ferries leaving in next 2 or 3 days , or will that not work out ? 3) How do I get permit for Lakshadweep ? Any pre requisites ? 4) I guess, Agatti is banned for now. Which are the other islands to visit ? Is night stay restricted/banned on some other islands too ? 5) I am sure you must not have seen people camping with private tents on the island, but, who is in charge there ? I am sure there must not be any law/rule not to pitch up your own tent. I don't mind staying in a homestay later, if someone wakes me up (I am more afraid of humans rather than nature). But, in your personal opinion, do you think camping is possible and/or permitted on the island(s) ? 6) Will there be inter-island transport available (not private, but public transport) by private operators or does one need to plan that too in advance (supposing question 1 returns a positive answer )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:31:44.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
