By on July 1st, 2015 We are often asked what we do about healthcare and insurance for our family while we travel. It’s a topic that is much discussed among travelers, solo, couples and families alike. Should we have it? Can we do with out it? What kind of insurance is best? Which companies provide it? What should we look for in a policy? Does our home insurance cover us when we’re abroad? \nIt can be more than a little bit confusing. If you’re American and required to be enrolled in an Obama Care certified policy, what does that mean for your travels abroad? If you’re Canadian, or British, or from another country that provides national healthcare, how long can you be out of the country before that insurance becomes invalid? “First, let me say that insurance, the type, as well as how much coverage you carry, is a very personal decision.” First, let me say that insurance, the type, as well as how much coverage you carry, is a very personal decision. There is not one “right” blanket statement about insurance at home or abroad. It does, however, bear careful consideration as you plan your trip.\nI have several friends who swear that it’s an unnecessary expense, the odds are in your favor, and they’ve traveled without it for years. I have other friends, who have required medical evacuation from outer Mongolia, and Ethiopia and who are eternally grateful for having had insurance to cover those expenses. One of my friends swears that her husband would be dead without it. She’s very likely right. \nThen, there are the vast majority of us who carry it and rarely (knock on wood) use it. We’ve made a few claims over the years: for dental work in Vienna and Bali, eye exams in Indonesia, and an overnight hospital stay in Thailand. Most of the time, the healthcare we’ve required has been so inexpensive that we’ve just paid out of pocket: stitches in New Zealand, a finger tip sliced off and a broken foot in Guatemala, surgical extraction of an embedded fish hook in Thailand, eye exams and glasses in Canada. We’ve paid in more than we’ve pulled out, for sure. But that’s the thing about insurance, isn’t it? It seems like an exorbitant expense until you really need it. It feels, perhaps, unnecessary, until it is vital. \nOur personal philosophy is to carry it. We feel, as the parents of four children, that it’s our moral imperative to provide for our children in every way that we can. For us, this includes access to proper healthcare and the means to pay for it, which is partially covered by insurance. We have been profoundly lucky, in 19 years of parenthood, not to have a serious injury or illness with our brood. We are tangibly aware that those winds could change at any moment; which is why we carry insurance. Travel Insurance is Different It’s very important to note that travel insurance is different than the insurance that covers you at home. This is true, regardless of your country of origin. Costs are figured based on broad regions and where you plan to be. This is one reason that travel insurance often feels “cheap” to Americans going abroad, while foreigners planning to travel through America get sticker shock from their policies. What is covered, varies widely, and you should definitely read the small print of your policy. Well child check ups, pregnancy, and pre-existing conditions are almost never included. There will be caps to the amount covered per person and per family, and these caps are relatively low (often in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars). Travel and gear are often covered. Trip interruption and delay are often covered. \nThe take home message: do your homework and actually READ your policy. Are you dreaming of a Round the World Trip? Sign up for our RTW Airfare Report > Traveler’s Insurance vs. Expat Insurance There’s a big difference between, relatively inexpensive, traveler’s insurance and expat insurance. Traveler’s health insurance can be purchased in chunks of up to six months duration and then renewed on the road. Longer term expat insurance often covers a very limited amount of time inside the USA (for Americans) and has more similarities with standard American style policies. Expat insurance covers more things, and is more like “real” insurance (without low coverage caps, for example) but it often lacks some of the perks that travelers enjoy of trip and gear coverage. How do you know which is right for you? It will depend greatly on the type of trip you’re taking and the duration of your stay abroad. For our family, moving around every 3-6 months and hopping continents often, traveler’s insurance has been fine. Our friends who’ve taught abroad for years at a time, rooted in one place, went with expat health insurance.\nA few companies to check out:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T19:42:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
