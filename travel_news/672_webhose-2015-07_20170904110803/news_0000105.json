The Peninsula Shanghai topped the Best Hotel in Asia readers’ poll with an impressive score of 96 out of 100. Despite only opening in October 2009 , the Bund-front hotel confirmed its stellar reputation among discerning travellers in China , Asia and worldwide by also being voted eighth on the World’s Best 100 Hotels list. Among the unique services offered to guests, The Peninsula Shanghai is the first hotel anywhere in the world to include the BMW i8 hybrid sports car in its vehicle fleet, and offers private luxury cruises on the Huangpu River aboard The Peninsula Princess 54 yacht. \nIn addition to the success of The Peninsula Shanghai in winning the 2015 Best Hotel in Asia award, the details of which are published in the August 2015 issue of Travel + Leisure (US) , The Peninsula Hotels also ranked third in the overall Top Hotel Brands Category, a rise of four places from the seventh position achieved on the 2014 reader survey. \n“We are very proud to receive this prestigious award from a respected international publication such as Travel + Leisure . To be voted the Best Hotel in Asia is a considerable achievement for the entire team at The Peninsula Shanghai, especially as we have been open for less than six years. During that time, everyone has worked tirelessly to deliver award-winning standards of service and comfort for our guests, and to show that luxury hospitality in China can be truly world-class,” said Joseph W.Y. Chong , General Manager and Managing Director of The Peninsula Shanghai Complex. \nIn its review of The Peninsula Shanghai, published on its website ( www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best ) Travel + Leisure notes: “On a stretch of the historic Bund, the 13-story granite-clad building is a Modernist reflection of its Art Deco-era neighbors … the 235 guest rooms combine embossed glass lamps and black-lacquer screens with 21st-century amenities. All come with VoIP phones, portable master control panels and spa tubs with music and light settings.” \nThe Best Hotels in Asia category forms part of the annual World’s Best Awards reader survey published by Travel + Leisure , a publication that is widely recognised as a leading global authority on travel and tourism trends. Each year, the readers of Travel + Leisure are asked to cast their votes for the hotels, airlines, car rental companies, destinations, airports, cruise lines and tour operators that represent the ultimate in worldwide travel. \nIn the World’s Best Hotels section of the survey, respondents are asked to rate hotels on room quality and facilities, location, service standards, restaurants and food, and overall value, plus optional characteristics for business and family travellers, for romance, for bars and nightlife and for design. The World’s Best Hotels Awards are divided into six regional categories: United States and Canada ; Mexico , Central and South America ; Asia ; Europe ; Australia , New Zealand and the South Pacific; and Africa and the Middle East .
