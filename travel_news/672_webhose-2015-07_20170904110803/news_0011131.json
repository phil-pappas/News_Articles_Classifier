But there should be. My Sicilian-American mother-in-law tells stories of fleets of black limos that descended on a certain California farmhouse when her uncle from the East Coast came to town to conduct business. Children were ushered into the basement. Favors were extended and called in, if you get my drift.\nI didn't find this uncle's picture among the thousands of images and artifacts at the Mob Museum, but I did learn a lot about the history of organized crime in America — and the law-enforcement officers who risked their lives to bring criminals to justice.\nRELATED: Las Vegas: 5,000-seat showroom coming to Monte Carlo​\nThe museum tells the history of cops and crime families from 19th-century immigrants to as recently as just a few years ago, through interactive exhibits and one-of-a-kind artifacts.\nAt the Mob Museum, you can take part in a lineup behind one-way glass. Or play a table game with fellow patrons, betting virtual money on your knowledge of mob history. \"Shoot\" a simulated Tommy gun. Sit in the \"electric\" chair (you don't even have to put a quarter in to make it shake and light up). See Al Capone's family photos. Learn FBI jargon and surveillance techniques. Handle a deactivated service weapon. Explore how cops and bad guys influenced history and pop culture.\nBut perhaps the most unusual exhibit at the Mob Museum is the building itself, an accessible 1930s federal court building meticulously restored with original fixtures and furnishings and staffed with knowledgeable docents. Visitors learn about the 1950s Kefauver hearings on organized crime in the very courtroom where some of them took place. Marvel at your proximity to history — and how the structure was never imploded to make room for a casino.\nRELATED: Las Vegas attempts to tame rowdy Fremont Street experience\nVisitors from Arizona may want to pay special attention to the exhibit on mob hits. Look for the image of the aftermath of the car bomb that killed Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles in 1976. Warning: Pictures aren't especially gruesome, but sensitive viewers may prefer to exercise discretion.\nAnd if you've had a brush with infamy like my mother-in-law's? The museum has a booth where you can record your story for its archives.\nA few tips: Expect to spend about three hours walking the museum's three floors. Take public transportation or pay for parking. And buy timed-entry admission online for a $2 discount on regular adult tickets. But you didn't hear that from me.\nThe Mob Museum\nWhen: Open daily.
