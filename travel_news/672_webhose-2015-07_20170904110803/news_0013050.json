A 40-room boutique hotel, the Kirketon has grown over the past eight years to embrace a bar and a restaurant - Eau de Vie and Fu Manchu (above) - which are on site but independently run, so guests are essentially getting a three-for-one deal. That Wi-fi is free throughout the property is sheer common sense; complimentary phone calls to anywhere in Oz are the icing on the boutique cake. Note that this is a heritage building (below), so they've not been allowed to install a lift - however, the staff are a) hunky b) obliging. If the New South Wales capital is the archetypal millennial city, then the Kirketon's an utterly Twenty-Fifteen kip.\nBeds: the Kirketon's rooms (below) are not overly large - ranging from 17 to 28 square metres - and none can claim a harbour view, or indeed any sort of panorama to speak of. However, they are incredibly snug and decked out with plenty of mirrors and metallic hues - Australian rather than Arabian nights, you might say. Rooms are endowed with MicroCloud bedding, which fervently encourages early bedtimes and long lie-ins, while the super-powerful showers could well be branded Victoria Falls. Expect all the usual audio-visual initials - LCD TV, CD, DVD - though, if you're doing Sydney properly, you shouldn't have the time or the inclination to fossick for the remote.\nFood: you'll have to head out of the hotel for breakfast and lunch but there's no shortage of choice nearby, e.g. boutique bar-cum-caf√© Tigerbakers. Come suppertime, Fu Manchu beckons. Dubbed The Fu, it hitched its wagon to the hotel a couple of years ago, and - with a pedigree stretching back two decades - has flourished as a result. Glossy wooden tables, traditional screens and paper lanterns act as the canvas for a menu that's catholic Chinese with tinges of Asian. So expect to see Beijing dumplings and Malay lamb shank curry as well as a range of vegetarian/coeliac dishes. The wine list embraces a raft of teas, a trio of sakes, a respectable coterie of Aussie reds and whites, and - what else? - Mountain Goat Pale Ale.\nDrink: Check out the scores of bottles stacked up behind Eau de Vie's bar (below), an antique Tantalus, and the sort of low lighting and ceilings that encourage alcohol-tinged conviviality. A fair amount of energy has been poured into the cocktail list, which has a historic theme and a fabulous array of tastes. The Tempest, which marries spiced rum, lime and berry compote with tawny port and a dash of angostura bitters is a prime example.\nBeyond: Gay, as in light-hearted and carefree, pretty much sums up the 'Hurst, although it's hardly a secret that it's an LGBT mecca. Slightly edgier, Kings Cross is just up the road, while all of Sydney's manifest delights - harbour, beaches, bridge, Opera House and the 65-hectare Royal Botanic Gardens, where official notices positively implore visitors to walk on the grass and hug the trees - are accessible with a modicum of effort.\nWhat's the bottom line?
