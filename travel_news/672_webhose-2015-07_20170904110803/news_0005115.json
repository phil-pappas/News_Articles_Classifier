The catering company has beaten its revenue targets for 2014/2015 and increased revenues from the previous financial year by £420,000. \nContributing towards the success was a number of new wins in the ‘meet’ and ‘visit’ external events and venues. This included securing a five year contract worth £2million with Boughton House, and winning the tender for Moseley Rugby Club, worth £350,000 revenue per annum. Over the last 12 months Amadeus has organised and catered for 44 weddings across its portfolio of managed licensed venues; Boughton House, Stonleigh Abbey, Riverside and Hagley Hall. Alongside winning new contracts Amadeus has renewed existing accounts too including the Lawn Tennis Association and IMG which have both renewed for a further four years, bringing in revenues of £1.7million. As well as success with external contracts, Amadeus has had great accomplishment within its home venues too with the opening of four new food concepts within the group venues, bringing an increase in sales of approximately 6% . At Genting Arena the company drove a 5% increase in sales by teaming up with Old El Paso to launch the first arena retail unit in the UK - taking £2,500 in the first two hours of trading and partnering with the leader of Authentic Chinese sauces to launch the new Lee Kum Kee Hot Wok Kitchen and refitting the fish & chip and burger kiosks. At the NEC during one day at Crufts 2015 Amadeus took over 2,000 transactions in hall-catering, almost 1,500 transactions in Starbucks in the Piazza and over 1,500 transactions in mobile outlets. Kevin Watson, Managing Director for Amadeus says: “Every year we invest a lot of time, effort and resource into our workforce, into our menus, into our relationships and into our customer service. “Last year we trained over 1,000 employees to sell, not just serve – giving the customer a better experience and journey and increasing our transaction spend. Five of our General Managers grew their business revenue by £5.3million compared to the previous year. We took 61 school leavers into our apprenticeship scheme – which also saw one of our existing apprentices crowned Wing Yip Young Chef of the Year. We added to our portfolio of heritage sites by winning the contract at Boughton House and we delivered a 300% growth on events at Stoneleigh Abbey. And we smashed transaction and sales revenues at live events.” As part of Amadeus’ continued investment into the business and to reflect its passion for quality food and service Amadeus has ended its fantastic year with the launch of a new website. With two sides to the business Amadeus had two objectives for the new website – to drive new business enquiries and drive new event enquiries. With a creative approach to catering the design team were briefed to reflect this personality and brand proposition in the website design, while balancing it out with the right amount of information. And with an increasing number of people accessing websites via mobile devices it was important that the site was responsive across all platforms. Kevin Watson continued: “The launch of the new website is a fantastic way to end this successful year. It reflects our passion, our personality and our pride. i am incredibly proud of everyone at Amadeus for their contribution to our successful year as we work hard as a team to deliver quality food, quality service and quality relationships. “We have 135 highly experienced chefs, 15 innovation specialists, seven board members with over 135 years’ experience in the food industry and over 670 experienced serving staff. When you add in a huge helping of passion for the industry and over 650 catering awards under our belt you can see that we have a good recipe for success - and that is what has helped us smash the £4.9million budget by £420,000.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:16:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
