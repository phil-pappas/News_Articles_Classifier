Located opposite Green Park and nearby the Royal Parks of London, the new outside terrace allows guests the chance to bask in the charm of their surroundings whilst watching London go by. \nCapturing the spirit of the city, diners can enjoy an all day menu catering for morning coffee, alfresco lunch or a refreshing class of rose as the sunsets over Green Park. Committed to providing an outstanding and friendly service, visitors looking for the perfect spot to rejuvenate after a full day of activity in the Capital can settle behind the perfectly preened hedgerows and relax in the open-air setting. Commenting on the new terrace design, General Manager Jeremy Hopkins said, “We have been looking at ways to enhance customer experience so we are delighted to be one of the only hotels in Mayfair to offer an outdoor terrace over the summer months. We hope that local visitors along with guests staying at the hotel will be able to enjoy the new space and appreciate summer afternoons in London.” The Athenaeum Hotel & Apartments terrace is open from 8am daily.
