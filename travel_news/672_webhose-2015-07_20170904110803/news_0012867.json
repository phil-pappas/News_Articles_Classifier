According to data compiled by the Israel Airports Authority (IAA), more than 3.2 million passengers (Israelis and tourists, on arriving and departing flights) are expected to pass through Israel's international airport throughout July and August – a forecast which is very close to the figures of the summer of 2013.\n The highest traffic is expected to be recorded between Tel Aviv and Greece, Turkey (for connecting flights), Germany, the United States, Italy and France.\n Coming Soon From Tel Aviv to Amsterdam for €48 / Ynetnews EasyJet introduces new route in addition to nine existing routes it already operates out of Israel. Full story\nAccording to the forecast, 1.56 million passengers are expected to pass through Ben-Gurion Airport in July (a 6% increase from the same period last year) and 1.7 passengers in August (a 7% increase).\nIsraelis' departures abroad in July and August are expected to set a new record in any event, due to an 11% increase in the number of departures abroad by Israelis.
