At what altitude are aircraft safe from birds in flight?\n-- Submitted by reader Jay Alan, Indiana\nAnswer: Above 10,000 feet there are only a few birds. however, bird strikes have occurred at 30,000 feet and higher. The vast majority of strikes occur below 3,000 feet above the ground.\nQ: Are turboprop aircraft less susceptible to engine damage caused by striking large birds?\n-- Bruce, Carlsbad, Calif.\nA: Turboprops are somewhat less susceptible to bird-strike damage, as they have the propeller to deflect the birds from entering the engine inlet.\nQ: Why not have sliding covers on the engines that can be deployed when birds are a danger?\n-- Roger Rordrigues, Burr Ridge, Ill.\nA: The airflow distortion would be a significant concern, as well as weight and complexity. Jets require very carefully controlled airflow, anything that would alter this flow could adversely affect control.\nQ: Love your columns and TV appearances. I live relatively close to Newark and have noticed that most of the landing lights are steadily on, while a few have them alternating. Is there any reason for that? And why are there lights that illuminate the engine during takeoff and landing?\n-- Ted, N.J.\nA: The pulsing lights are an attempt to reduce bird strikes. There is some evidence that pulsing lights are more obvious to birds than steady ones. A few operators have installed pulsing lights, but most have retained the steady ones.\nThe wing lights you refer to as illuminating the engines are anti-icing lights. These lights allow the pilots to see the wings and detect any ice that may have accumulated, thus requiring the activation of the wing anti/de-icing system.\nMORE: Read previous columns\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\n1 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1ITPdio TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635721215205004147-ThinkstockPhotos-483392349.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1ITPdio&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1ITPdio&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20At%20what%20altitude%20are%20planes%20safe%20from%20birds%3F&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b42afe35b1b89262dad1ad79f5d6f90922356c9/c=43-0-1916-1408&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635721215205004147-ThinkstockPhotos-483392349.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1ITPdio", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ"], "published": "2015-07-12T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:14:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
