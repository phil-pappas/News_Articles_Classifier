I did a cartoonish double-take in the chilled meat section of Metro, a wholesale supermarket. Rabbit or cat? Barbara couldn't tell at first ... I like to linger in the cooler sections of the supermarkets in my adopted hometown of Ho Chi Minh City, which steams for 10 months of the year. Closer inspection of the cat-like cadavers, trapped in transparent body bags, revealed the Vietnamese word for rabbit, thỏ . The carcasses inside did have buck teeth and long ears, but without the head, it would have been a line-ball call. It's not the first time I've been astonished while supermarket shopping in Vietnam, a country where dog, cat, turtle, ostrich, snake and scorpion appear on menus. This is supermarket shopping, mind you. The wet markets of Vietnam are something else entirely, full of challenging cuts of meat (if ears, trotters and tongues can be considered meat), live seafood and frogs, available skin-on or skin-off. Somehow I expect Western-style air-conditioned supermarkets to be more... Western. At our local C-Express mini-mart, the refrigerated display contains meat on polystyrene trays: pork mince, beef fillets and chicken pieces, including heads and feet. At Metro, the seafood department is help-yourself. One tank contains an expressive pointy-nosed fish, a type of sturgeon known locally as cá tầm , that seem to mouth \"help help help\" through the thick glass. As a squeamish person, I have a love-hate relationship with supermarket prawn fishing. Catching the prawns with the long-handled green scoops is quite fun but manhandling them into a plastic bag is awkward, and taking the kicking, jumping bag to the weighing station is just plain weird. The next step of personally killing the prawns is something I leave to my husband. Hypocritical, I know. The fresh produce section contains a baffling array of leaves, flowers and fungus. Over the years I've learnt the names and uses of some items, but not others. There's a purple leaf I'm not sure what to do with, although I know the mustard leaves are used as wrappers, and the edible chrysanthemum leaves are for soups, such as hủ tiếu . Mung bean ice cream could be an acquired taste Metro sells flowers for ancestor altars and for the dinner table. Most families have an ancestor altar, with portraits of their dead relatives, who are honoured with flowers, fruit, incense, rice wine and often coffee and cigarettes. The belief is that if you look after your ancestors, they will look after you by sending you good luck in business and family matters. The altar flowers are sold long-stemmed, in bunches, while the edible flowers are sold in mesh bags like onions, or in plastic trays like cherry tomatoes. The rows of deep freezers at this supermarket are filled with the recognisable and the unrecognisable, including taro and mung bean ice cream and \"crispy spring rolls for children\" (are adults allowed to try?). I'm drawn to the \"green rice torpedo shrimp\" and the taro-wrapped prawns that look like they're trapped in a swirl of linguine. Some supermarket items are sold in plastic security containers, a reaction to the urban legend that these things taste better when stolen. Hershey chocolate and cans of Spam are among the foodstuffs that require extra supermarket security, goods that were hot property on the black market during the Vietnam War. Hershey bars behind bars There are very few Vietnamese products in jars or tins. Locals, especially here in the south where there is no winter, prefer to eat fresh local produce, bought and eaten the same day. It's the crazy foreigners who like to store food for weeks or even months, so most of the tins and jars sold in supermarkets are imported. Government regulations require imported food carry a translation of the key information. These translations are printed on stickers, which often obscure the original labelling. And so the pricey expat shops can be as surprising as the local supermarkets. It's only the ridiculous prices that stop me from buying some of the more ridiculous items, such as a tin of Pelures de Truffes, a Chinese product helpfully labelled in English as Himalayan Truffles Peelings, and a price tag equivalent to £13.85. The juxtaposition of the familiar and the strange can be odd. Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce and HP Sauce are sold next to bottles of Louisiana Hot Sauce, jars of Bisque de Homard and sauces labelled entirely in Japanese (apart from the Vietnamese translation sticker, of course). Barbara, an Australian, occasionally finds a taste of home in the supermarket For those who find solace in the beer aisle, there's an eclectic selection that, unusually, includes Royalty Diet Ginger Beer. There are a range of Belgian offerings, as well as local brews Zorok, 333 and Tiger. And, from time to time, Cooper's Pale Ale from Australia. The local supermarkets can be as frustrating as they are entertaining. This week I finally gave in to my hankering for pasta with minted peas and sour cream. I know the frozen peas here remain hard, even after being boiled for half an hour or more. So I went with an expensive tin of Italian peas. None of our three local supermarkets had sour cream and I just could not bring myself to pay the equivalent of £5.20 for a small tub of French crème fraîche. So I made my own with local kefir and a couple of triangles of Con Bò Cười (Laughing Cow) cream cheese. Mixed with Italian spaghetti, mint from the garden, chunks of leftover roast chicken and a sprinkle of local fromage (the Vietnamese loan-word for cheese), it hit the spot. Craving satisfied, I can return to our usual rotation of dishes that use local ingredients, and cost one-tenth the price of tonight's extravaganza. Tomorrow we'll have fried tofu stuffed with lemongrass and chilli. It's cheap, cheerful and all the ingredients are available from one lady at our local wet market.
