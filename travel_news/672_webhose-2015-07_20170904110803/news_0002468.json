Here is what they said about the tour: Russian Federation counsellor Victor Konnov: First, I would like to thank the Inner Mongolian government for their hospitality. For most of us, including me, it was our first trip to Inner Mongolia. It is very difficult to summarise all my impressions. Inner Mongolia has a population of more than 24 million in population, is approximately 1.2m square kilometres in size, and the culture somehow manages to encompass both traditional and modern ways. We visited the Genghis Khan museum, among other museums and theatres, and an art centre. This helped us understand better Inner Mongolia’s traditions, its deep roots, because it is one of the world’s greatest civilisations in history. But we also saw modern industry, in particular the Yili industrial group, where milk and dairy products are produced. We were very impressed by this technology. In Ordos, we were very impressed by the modern buildings and the growth. Overall, I believe we were all impressed by your successful policy of openness and modernization, also by your wonderful climate, your clean air and blue sky. On future cultural exchange and cooperation I’m not only a Russian Federation counsellor, but I’m also the director of Russian Cultural Activity, which is very important to me. I hope Inner Mongolia and Russia’s cultural exchanges will become more frequent. I would like to see cultural exchanges in every field. Music, for example, because I saw that your musical instruments are very different from Russian ones. Especially the Ma Tou Qin, or the horse head fiddle. They are very rare. I also like wrestling. Austria Embassy counsellor Gudrun Hardiman-Pollross: China is the tenth country I've visited and I have seen lots of culture and lots of traditional places around the world. When you experience a traditional Mongolian wedding, it is very impressive, and perhaps reminded me of the traditions I experienced in Serbia, India and Africa. Some bits and pieces of every culture are very similar. In the evening there was a nice banquet with the bride, which was an acting bride, but still, we need to interpret this experience and I tried, but we couldn’t really communicate until the singing started and the Ganbei (drinking toasts). Then we had no problem in communicating with each other. Culture is clearly something that has no border. On cultural exchange between Austria and Inner Mongolia I foresee the development of more cultural ties. I hope we do send some cultural productions here to Hohhot and possibly to Ordos, so people here can experience a little bit of the Austrian culture. The Mongol voice is world famous, so I do hope we can work a little bit together on voices as well, because I think it would be very interesting for an Austrian professional singer to learn how the Mongols use their voices. Sudan counsellor Emad Addin Ibrahim Ahmed Hijazy: For me it was a good way to experience Chinese culture. The first thing that comes to mind is the management of the preservation of culture of these ethnic groups, especially the ones that could use more preservation. I’d like to be able to work with China, and see this achieved. It’s not only a relationship of country to country, but people to people. And it’s also a culture to culture distribution. And in my country, we have similar groups like Inner Mongolia, and I hope that one day, we can have a partnership with Inner Mongolia. Thank you, China. Thank you for your support and for this wonderful programme. First secretary of Nigerian Embassy Sulaiman Rabiu (second from right) Zimbabwe counsellor Rangarirai Muzapu: My first impression is of how Yili is developing their technology in their dairy farm and dairy processing. It is about making space very productive. And it’s a question of hygiene, which is reflected in the high quality of milk they produce. Similarly, cows are healthier. The production systems, the technology, the way they do things are all highly impressive. Goethe-Institut China director Rafael Damian Deschka: It was a great experience, a great pleasure. I was very impressed by the connection between choral music and elements of ethnicity and nature. Uruguay Embassy consultant Mariano Fernandez Zurmendi: I would join my colleagues and say thank you to the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and representatives of the Inner Mongolian government, Ordos city and Hohhot city. I’m sure this is not going to be my last time here in Mongolia. And when I go back to the office, I will try to convince my colleagues of having more cultural exchange between our people. Mariano's impression of Yili dairy group It’s something that has a very big dimension. I never imagined this. They talk about 8,000 cows where they’re producing milk every day. Everything is very well organised. I know it is a very big brand worldwide as well as in China, where I have been living for six years. It’s very interesting to come to the place and see how Yili produce the milk. As people from the city, it’s not every day that we have the opportunity to come and see how they raise the cattle, how they feed the cattle - all the processes here. Macedonia Embassy assistant to ambassador Borjan Zafirovski: I would like to thank you for this wonderful opportunity to take part in this cultural tour. Mongolia Embassy first secretary Sukh-Erdene Dugersuren: I would like to thank the people who put this event together, thank them for their love and their enthusiasm for preserving this culture. China Daily editor Faisal Kidwai Sukh-Erdene's impression of Hohhot The city is very modern. I didn’t think it was going to be this modern. I was expecting something more traditional, but now it looks very modern. And I’m proud of my brothers and sisters. Nigeria Embassy first secretary Sulaiman Rabiu: I can see that the government has pride in and wants to preserve the culture, especially the ethnic groups. Let me share a little bit of my own experience, of my own cultural background in Nigeria. After the civil war in the late Seventies, we’ve made little progress with cultural groups because we have too many, 250. So what we did was, we came up with different cultural exchanges with local governments to come together to present their own cultural performances. In the beginning, the main objective was to prove our unity between the different regions of the country. And now it has gone big, to the extent that it attracts foreign tourists. I found myself amazed by Inner Mongolia. On the performance by the Inner Mongolia National Art Troupe The performances were wonderful. In fact, overwhelming. And I’m particularly amazed by the first performance. That troupe is really a perfect troupe. ROK press officer Huang Insoo: I am very much interested in culture of ethnic groups. I used to teach in Minzu University of China and had done a lot of research into ethnicity. I was very impressed by the beautiful scenery and Inner Mongolia festivals, especially the wedding tradition. Bulgaria Embassy press officer Denitza Hristova Cherneva: I would just like to personally express my sincere appreciation of your hospitality and your organisation of the trip. Algeria Embassy attache Ammar Benkirat: I would also like to express my warm thanks to all my friends here. You shared everything that you have here with us, so we would like to share part of us with you. Mark Howard Levine, Friendship Award Laureate: Although much of my time is spent teaching English to Chinese students, I also do everything I can to learn about Chinese culture, especially the diversity of ethnic cultures, and to try to teach that to people of my own country and people from other countries as well. One more thing: I teach at Zhongyang MingZu University (Minzu University of China) in Beijing, and many of my students come from Inner Mongolia. And yesterday, as I was taking photographs with my telephone, and putting those photos on WeChat, I got many messages from my students, saying they wished they were home. I know that my students from Inner Mongolia have great love and respect for their home. The majority of the students from Inner Mongolia, regardless of their ethnicity, are very hard working and pretty good English speakers. So this is a compliment to your educational system here. China Daily editor Andrew Eric Ancheta, America: We usually think of China as a country of rice and Confucius, and we don't know about the other parts of China. It's great to learn about Genghis Khan and the culture of Inner Mongolia. Cultural exchanges are an important part of diplomacy and a good way for China to make friends. I work at China Daily. I will write about my experience to let more foreigners know Inner Mongolia. China Daily editor Faisal Kidwai, India: There are 1,001 reasons to visit Inner Mongolia. From watching the bluest sky in the world, the smiling faces that will greet you at every corner… but if you’re really short on time, then I would high recommend a visit to the National Art Troupe in the Capital Hall. Inner Mongolia’s folk music and its performances will stay with you forever. The museum is impressive. Inner Mongolia has so many interesting things, but I don’t see the foreign newspapers, the TV, the internet saying much about Inner Mongolian ethnic groups. Maybe we need to better promote Inner Mongolia, especially the groups. This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
