I'll be posting daily for the next 45 days starting with this little video clip illustrating the unique sense of humor of the German people. \nThis trip will be really fun: Ten days in Germany filming our one-hour Martin Luther and the Reformation special for public television (due out in time for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017). Then it's three weeks researching in London and south England , and then three more weeks in Germany filming three new episodes of \"Rick Steves' Europe\" (covering the great German cities of Nürnberg , Hamburg , Frankfurt , Leipzig, Würzburg , and Dresden ). But for now, watch this video clip and join me for a beer with two friends in Wittenberg. \nFollow Rick Steves on Twitter: www.twitter.com/RickSteves More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:55:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
