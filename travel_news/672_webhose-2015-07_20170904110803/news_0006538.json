Now he heads to work equipped with a camera phone. He walks the streets of Raqqa, the Syrian city that has become the self-styled capital of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) taking clandestine photographs and videos of anything that exposes the terrorists’ lies: bombed-out buildings, empty food stalls, homeless families. He then uploads the images to Twitter. The clicks of a camera phone in the Levant may seemingly have little to do with what David Cameron last week called “the struggle of our generation” in his speech on Britain’s new counter-extremism strategy, but Abu Rafiq is working on its front line. Raqqa is the heart of an Isil propaganda machine so vast and sophisticated it can seep into vulnerable young minds thousands of miles away. Some 5,000 European jihadists have fallen for its message, at least 700 of whom are British. In the past three years, the Metropolitan Police has removed nearly 60,000 pieces of terrorist online content. • Banned staff revealed to be teaching at Trojan horse school • David Cameron takes the fight to Isil, drafting plans to intervene against jihadists in Libya Rafiq and his men have been operating since the turn of the year. They aim to disrupt conversations between would-be jihadists and the so-called caliphate they profess to join. It is dangerous work – some activists have already been captured by Isil. Last week, according to the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Isil shut down private Wi-Fi access across Raqqa, forcing people into public internet cafés, where they can be better monitored. “Isil only tell the world what they want but we want to tell people what is actually happening,” Abu Rafiq (his nom de guerre) says from an undisclosed location in his first interview with the British media. “We take as much as we can with our people on the ground, anything to counter what they say is the truth. “They use Twitter , so we go on Twitter to target their propaganda. It is very dangerous because they are everywhere, watching everything. But we will win in the end.” At present the terrorists are winning. Western authorities are still coming to grips with the sophistication of the slickly produced videos and social media profiles through which Isil preaches. Then there is the sheer amount. One study from respected US think-tank the Brookings Institution published in March uncovered 46,000 Twitter accounts being used by Isil supporters over the course of four months. Separately, its various propaganda wings based within Isil-controlled territory are churning out feature-length “documentaries” with titles such as Flames of War, periodicals such as the glossy magazine Dabiq, recruitment nashids (hymns), short clips known as “Mujatweets” and even a jihadist computer game based on Grand Theft Auto. “Isil has taken it to the next level,” concedes Rob Wainwright, director of Europol. Earlier this month, the agency launched a Europe-wide unit to monitor and combat terrorist propaganda. “[Isil] will use different platforms at different times and move between them to regenerate material when we close them down,” he said. A study published in the journal Perspectives on Terrorism last month describes these online tactics as “swarmcasting” – operating in huge numbers across various social media platforms. One video published by the Isil propaganda wing al-I’tasimu last year was viewed 56,998 times within 24 hours of being posted on YouTube. • How Isil jihadists spread hate with Twitter army of 45,000 The appeal lies in the quality of the production. The jihadists digitally enhance their movies so they are awash with colour, and explosions detonate in super-slow motion. Real battlefield footage is shot in HD using drones. Photographs the group releases are similarly crafted to draw in young Westerners. When Talha Asmal, a 17-year-old from Dewsbury, West Yorks, became Britain’s youngest suicide bomber in June after blowing himself up in a car bomb in Iraq, Isil released images of him standing by Toyota SUVs bedecked in Islamic State’s black flag. “There are now people in a central base who do editing for other parts of the Islamic State so they can churn these things out very quickly,” said Richard Barrett, a former counter-terrorism chief at both MI5 and MI6 and now senior vice-president at the Soufan Group, a security consultancy. He cites the appallingly stylised video of the mass murder of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya earlier this year – when the victims were marched along the sand in orange jumpsuits before being beheaded so the sea ran red with blood – as bearing all the hallmarks of Isil films made in Raqqa. • How Islamic State uses the Bethnal Green girls on Twitter According to Mr Barrett, and others, there is another more insidious element to the propaganda. Isil is pumping out masses of information each day on seemingly parochial matters from within the territory it controls: motorcycle licence regulations, street lighting, what is on sale in the local bazaar, all “to emphasise that it is operating a state”, Mr Barrett says. Meanwhile, the Tumblr blog Umm Layth, which is thought to belong to Aqsa Mahmood, the privately educated 20-year-old who fled her family home in Glasgow in 2013 for Syria and has since married a jihadist, published a checklist this week for women preparing for Hijrah, or “holy emigration”. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T07:03:52.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
