Compliant Venues Ltd, an independent consultancy which helps venues to understand and work more effectively with the healthcare sector, they carried out a rigorous assessment of the University’s facilities and staff to ensure the venue could meet the strict event compliance aims of transparency and appropriateness outlined by regulations across the healthcare sector. \nThese regulations bring the focus of events across the sector away from what have in the past been perceived as lavish meetings, with content often a secondary priority to entertainment, to more streamlined meetings where delivering and sharing scientific content in an appropriate setting is the one and only aim. Marcus Wilson, head of marketing at Keele University, says: “This accreditation really shows our expertise to deliver top quality events for the healthcare sector. We already work with a number of healthcare companies and hospitals, and this only serves to further align the activities with the fantastic academic reputation the University has for its Medical School.” Caroline Hill, director at Compliant Venues Ltd, says: “Keele University has a healthcare heart at its core. So this is a natural progression for Keele, and for us to work with a university of Keele’s type. We see Keele University obtaining its accreditation as the start of a long, collaborative project to continue to keep at the forefront of healthcare event expertise. The assessment that Compliant Venues carries out is very much about highlighting the right venues to the healthcare organisations looking for them through the website – healthcare-venues.com – and constantly working with venues to improve and train their staff to boost specialist healthcare knowledge across the industry as a whole.” To achieve the accreditation, four of the senior Keele University Conferences & Events team were trained to understand the protocol of healthcare events. Emma Woodcock, senior business development manager; Claire Axon, business development manager; Jo Williams, Keele University Conference & Events sales executive; and Sharon Faulke, senior internal Conference & Events sales executive, all received the specialist training. These four specialist staff will continue to receive tests and training every six and twelve months to keep their expertise up-to-date. Marcus Wilson continues: “We’re in the process of expanding the specialisms of our team, so we aren’t stopping just with our Compliant Venues accreditation. The Keele University Conference & Events team has also been working hard in preparation for its Green Business Tourism assessment later this year, something which we hope to be able to add to our offering to organisations.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T17:40:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
