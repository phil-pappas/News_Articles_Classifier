Beginning 16th July, the airline commenced four weekly passenger services to Sialkot where it already operates dedicated freighter services. A day later, on 17th July, Qatar Airways added Faisalabad to its Pakistan network with three flights a week. \nSialkot, which is in Pakistan's Punjab province and is one of the country's most populated cities, is famous for producing and exporting textiles due to its close proximity to Kashmir. With such a high volume of products being exported from the city, Qatar Airways Cargo has been operating a direct freighter service to Sialkot since 2008. Faisalabad is a city of more than seven million people located in the province of Punjab. A major centre of industry and manufacturing, the city which has seen rapid development is a major contributor towards the country’s GDP, contributing over 20%. Sialkot and Faisalabad have joined Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar as Qatar Airways’ routes to Pakistan served by non-stop flights from the airline’s Doha hub. In the coming weeks, Multan will also be added as the airline’s next Pakistani destination with three flights a week commencing from 2nd August. \"Qatar Airways has a long-standing commitment to serve Pakistan and we are delighted to operate an exceptionally comprehensive route network covering the length and breadth of the country,\" said His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive.
