Now with the support of a global industry leader such as Travelport, we will be even better placed to capitalise and expand into the considerable opportunities we see ahead of us,” added Samuels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:25:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
