Now in its fourth year, IGP is a program that provides monetary awards to support innovation exploration and development in the association community. These grants are funded through a major grant from the SunTrust Foundation and additional support from Whiteford, Taylor, & Preston L.L.P. and other donors.\nThere will be up to four grants awarded in three categories: travel, exploration, or hybrid (a combination of travel and exploration). Grant recipients will receive awards up to $10,000.\n“Each year, we receive applications from members who want to create new programs or services that will impact their members and communities. We are able to create this opportunity because of SunTrust Foundation support for the association community. Looking forward to seeing the proposals and learning the new initiatives members’ want to design and implement,” said Chair-Elect, ASAE Chair of ASAE Foundation Abe Eshkenazi, CSCP, FACHE, CPA, CAE, and Chief Executive Officer at APICS.\nIndividuals from professional or trade associations, nonprofits, association industry partners, and consulting companies that serve the association community are eligible to apply, and applicants or applicant teams must include at least one ASAE member. The ASAE Foundation is looking for proactive and creative ideas that help propel association management in such areas as leadership development, technology, marketing, membership and community engagement, product development, and business practices.\n“We have found associations love learning from each other, and it’s important to spur new ideas and innovation. ASAE Foundation strives to educate the community about different approaches in executing projects, ideas or services. These grants give members an opportunity to try a new idea and share lessons they have learned. It’s a win-win for the association sector,” said ASAE Executive Vice President and President of the ASAE Foundation Susan Robertson, CAE.\nRelated Posts San francisco travel achieves leed gold certification ASAE Foundation, Green Seal, Whiteford, Taylor & Preston Launching New Office Greening Program ASAE Foundation Announces Innovation Grants Program Award Winners ITB Berlin: Cross-border cooperation on the Danube National Restaurant Association Commends House Ways & Means Passage of Anti-Hunger Measure", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:52:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
