It could be that the last thing you built was a kebab tower at uni. Or you may be a dab hand with the Black & Decker. Either way, building a playhouse for your kids will give you a good workout and a massive sense of accomplishment. Most homes are overflowing these days - so think of it as doing yourself a favour too, as they'll be rampaging round the garden and drinking lemonade in the playhouse while you enjoy a well-deserved beer and a read of the paper. Your little ones will be so excited that it will seem like the most worthwhile project you've ever completed If you've got a bit of time on your hands and are reasonably competent at DIY, you can start from scratch and build it with pallets. Use pine, rather than a hardwood, or you'll end up in hospital from trying to make it bend to your will. A soft wood is easily managed, but you'll need a good range of DIY equipment, including a jigsaw and a workbench. If you're more of a Sunday driver when it comes to building, start with a playhouse kit. It may cost more, but the savings you'll make on stress and mis-matched angles will more than justify it. You can get anything from simple hutch-style playhouses with four walls and a roof, to miniature French chateaux, with balconies and carvings. Browse Play Houses World for a huge range of styles, and bear in mind that you'll need to paint it, too. (Unless you buy pre-painted - but that would be cheating!) All will come with assembly instructions, but remember you're going to need a biggish space to build it in and some basic tools such as hammers, spirit levels and screwdrivers. Lifting the pieces, holding them up while you work and clambering around your structure will get the blood flowing and burn plenty of calories. You can even let the kids help with the safe bits, so family bonding time is an added extra. And when it’s finally ready, your little ones will be so excited that it will seem like the most worthwhile project you’ve ever completed.
