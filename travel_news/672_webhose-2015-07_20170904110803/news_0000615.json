The flight departed from Shemya with all 276 passengers and 18 crew, arriving in Anchorage at 14:11 local time on 29 July. \nMeanwhile, the airline operated a special flight, CX884D, to Anchorage from Hong Kong. Passengers of CX884 were transferred onto this relief flight which departed for Los Angeles at 22:48 local time. They arrived at Los Angeles International Airport at 04:28 local time on 30 July. \nCathay Pacific flew a team and a number of ground staff from Vancouver to Anchorage to attend to passengers, while a team greeted them on arrival in Los Angeles to offer any necessary assistance. Cathay Pacific Director Service Delivery James Ginns said: \"Once again, we send our sincere apologies to the passengers of Flight CX884. We thank them for their patience and understanding during our efforts to fly them to their intended destination. Safety will always remain our top priority and we will conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of this incident.\" \nThe airline said that a preliminary inspection indicates that an equipment cooling fan situated below the cabin floor near the forward cargo compartment had failed. Smoke was detected largely around the cockpit area as a result of this failure which led the Captain to make the precautionary diversion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:30:15.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
