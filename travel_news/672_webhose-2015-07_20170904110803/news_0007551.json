There was another case. That was the clincher that brought it all together. That for me was the Eureka moment, that something was going to happen now.”\nRon Jarvis was shot and killed by Stephen Roy Standage over a drug debt in 1992. Source: Channel 7\nThat clincher was the murder of John Lewis Thorn at Lake Leake, in Tasmania in August 2006.\nStandage, 62, was sentenced to 48 years for the murders of Mr Thorn, 59, and Mr Jarvis last year. He will not be eligible for parole until 2034.\nIt emerged during his murder trial, which has been described as one of the longest and most complex in Tasmanian history, that Standage was friends with both men and owed money and drugs to both of them.\nBut the similarities don’t end there. It was the location and method of their deaths as well. Both men had been taken to bush locations, shot in the head and covered with saplings.\nMs Marshall credits the now disbanded Tasmanian Police Cold Case Unit for catching Standage.\nAccording to The Mercury , police had long suspected Standage’s involvement in both killings but never had enough to pin anything on him.\nStandage was the last person to see Mr Jarvis alive and was the key witness at an inquest into his death. But Standage failed to turn up and police were unable to find him.\nYears later, following the death of Mr Thorn, Tasmanian police joined forces with Victorian police to set up an elaborate sting in Melbourne to catch Standage out.\nThey posed as a fictitious crime gang and Standage was sent to meet the fake kingpin “Gary”.\nDuring taped conversations Standage said the only way anyone would ever know if he had ever “knocked off” anybody was if he opened his own mouth, The Mercury reported.\nHe then suggested that any further conversations about the murders would “need to be in a swimming pool somewhere”, knowing that listening devices could not be worn in water.\nHe told gang members: “If I shot somebody, the murder weapon would disappear.”\nNot long after, in September 2010, police searched Standage’s former Lake Leake home. On November 2 they charged him with Mr Thorn’s murder.\nIt wasn’t until January 2012 that police charged Standage with the murder of Mr Jarvis.\nThe headstone where Ron Jarvis is buried. Source: Channel 7\nDuring the trial last year Ms Marshall revealed Standage had tried to offer her money to keep quiet after Mr Jarvis’s body was found and when she refused he then threatened her.\nDuring Standage’s sentencing hearing she then told Standage; “You underestimated my loyalty and love for Ron. And you underestimated me.\n“You Stephen Standage are a double murderer, a waster and a Judas. I hope you never again see the sky as a free man.”\nToday, Ms Marshall says she finally feels like this painful chapter in her life has closed but she revealed she still cries for the man she lost.\n“I cry more now for him than before,” she said. “It only hit me what we have lost, and how horribly unnecessary (his murder) it was.\n“He (Ron) should be here with me. We should be raising our children together.”\nMurder She Wrote airs on Channel 7 at 9.30pm on Sunday .\n ‘How I tracked my partner’s killer’", "external_links": ["http://www.themercury.com.au/news/scales-of-justice/how-double-murderer-stephen-standages-luck-finally-ran-out/story-fnj8cre7-1227028612698", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/275267-a2354842-31d0-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/275319-93c6e4a0-31d0-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/author-debi-marshall-reveals-how-she-tracked-down-her-partners-killer/story-e6frfmyi-1227457275347"], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T09:23:29.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
