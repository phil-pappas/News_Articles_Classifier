From 30-hour flights in coach to spend a mere 24 hours at a destination to freezing/boiling conditions to nearly being eaten by a lion – it takes more than a great lens to get the shot. It takes a real dedication to the craft, and the best travel photographers are always on the job. So, when there’s that free day to wander with a camera, we at Yahoo Travel were curious about which streets around the globe really inspire those who shoot for a living. We caught up with a dozen professional travel photographers and asked them about their favorite streets. From enjoying a gelato on sunny, flower-filled road in Bellagio, Italy to the early morning light down a dirt path in Myanmar to wandering aimless and happy in Brooklyn, NY - these romantic walkways stole their hearts. If you’re out exploring, grab your camera or iPhone and check them out.
