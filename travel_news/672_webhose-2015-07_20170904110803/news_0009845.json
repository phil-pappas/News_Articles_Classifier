James Martin, Europe Travel \nWhat's the best place in Europe to visit?\" is the inevitable question asked a million times, a question as impossible to answer as \"how long is a piece of string?\" Imagine: if we all lusted after exactly the same place, the world would likely wobble out of its orbit from the weight imbalance. But there comes a time when the hapless travel writer must take a long gulp on his Bourbon and Branch-water and apply himself to the impossible task of telling people what their favorite places ought to be without knowing their likes, dislikes, or inseam measurements. Harrumph...and so be it. The Curmudgeon's Choice of Europe's Top Vacation Cities - From North to South London England \nWho Should Go: Tourists afraid to be in a country where they don't know the language (remember not to leave anything in the boot of your car while in London!)

Travelers who like strong ale and theater History buffs - Even American History buffs - and English lit fans \nWhen They Should Visit: May through October, but you're liable to get rained upon anyway.
