And I haven’t painted a picture in going on 20 years. But all that is about to change. In the next sixty minutes I am going to paint a masterpiece of the orangery in Holland Park. Why the time limit? Because this is a speed painting outdoor masterclass. I’ve just been given a whirlwind introduction by Adebanji Alade on how to paint a scene like this. Adebanji is the 2013 winner of the Pintar Rapido competition, a unique outdoor painting festival that is celebrating its third year in London this month. He has captured the scene in front of us in less than half an hour, whilst giving me a running commentary. I am desperately trying to take it all in, remembering how to mix the colours for the red bricks, the grass, the tree trunks, the various shades of leaves. But Adebanji is having none of this concentration lark. “You’re not answering me, bruv,” he yells, on the verge of laughter. He’s trying to get me in the spirit for painting, but that spirit really isn’t what I was expecting. I had anticipated something perhaps a little bit more considered and serious. This is a lot more energetic than that. Adebanji’s motto is to paint what I see, not what I think. “The impressionists saved our lives. We could have been painting one leaf all the way,” he tells me as he captures the movement of a tree trunk with a single upwards stroke. With the time running against us, this feels more like a competition to me, like sport, than my traditional image of painting. I decide to attack my canvas with the energy that Adebanji has shown me. With sloppy lines I sketch in the main features. It doesn’t matter too much, it’s all getting painted over soon, so I make sure I get the lines of the building, the fountain, the pond and the trees and I’m done. A minute or two at most. • Sylvester Stallone: Not your average painter • Painting in old age may protect against dementia I try to emulate Adebanji’s approach, slapping down the colours onto the canvas, starting with the background and working forwards. The sky comes first. It’s a greyish blue, not a bright summery blue, despite the fact it’s June. We’re using acrylic paints instead of the oils Adebanji usually uses, as they are supposed to be more forgiving, which is just as well for me. I have several blobs of paint in front me. Liberally scooping blue, white, red and yellow paints, I eventually arrive at a suitable tone for the sky and then block the areas out. My hand has now worked its way to within an inch of the hairs of the brush. Surprisingly, it’s a very pleasing start. My main ambition for the hour is to get the canvas covered and hopefully get a decent impression of the scene. Perhaps to unearth that hidden unique talent. Although probably not, if I'm honest. Adebanji, meanwhile, is unwaveringly positive about my efforts. He believes that anyone can paint. It’s all about your mindset, he says. I’m not entirely convinced that I have got a delicate enough mindset as I splodge down colours where Adebanji had caressed them onto his canvas. There is inevitably too little or too much paint on my brush, but my mentor’s infectious energy sweeps that aside. This is a mere detail. And we are not about details here. The key to this style of painting, it seems, is squinting, to capture the essence of the scene. However, I discover that as well as painting I’m not actually very good at squinting either, though I can achieve a similar effect by going slightly cross-eyed. The variety in the greens and browns of the trees, grasses, flowers and shrubs causes me considerable problems as I try to constantly change the colour of a pool of paint which is now dominating my palette. The acidic green that I start with slowly descends into a muddy brown. Consequently, there is a corner of my painting that is a dark brown from where no light escapes. Stepping back, and crossing my eyes if necessary, I’m satisfied with what I’ve done. It doesn’t look too far off what Adebanji achieved in half the time. Or at least, it doesn’t look too far from what I remember him painting. As I look at his canvas, to which he has been applying details intermittently, this illusion is shattered, but I'm not going to let that upset me in the slightest. This is my first true work of art as an adult. Okay, okay, it’s not amazing. But give yourself an hour and see what you can do. My painting isn’t going to be appreciated by the coolly objective eye of the critic, even if they squint really hard, but it is always going to remind me of the fun I had painting it.
