It worked. \nLas Vegas is building a pro hockey arena on the Strip. Ice skating in the desert? No problem. It also decided it absolutely, positively had to have a giant observation wheel that lights up pink and purple at night -- and voila! The High Roller became a reality. \nThis city shows what money can do. Enough money, and anything is possible: bizarre dreams and odd quests and strange sights. The music is constant and pulsing here. I saw three showgirls on break standing on the sidewalk eating pizza in the dark, their feather headdresses resting on the grass like sleeping birds. I saw a couple emerging from the Little Vegas Wedding Chapel, the bride's long dress slashed to a miniskirt in front. Thank you, thank you very much. \nIn Las Vegas, even the puppets don't want to leave. \nIn an act at the Mirage Hotel and Casino by ventriloquist Terry Fator, puppet Winston is lured by glamorous Hollywood, only to find it so stressful he has to retreat to quieter Vegas. \nTurtles will always be turtles. But for humans, the whole point of Las Vegas is to pretend to be someone you never were and never will be, if only for the weekend. IN ON THE SECRET \nThis trip, I am staying at Hotel 32, a little-known boutique lodging high atop the Monte Carlo Hotel. It has just 51 rooms, separate check-in, a view of the shimmering Strip and little chocolates served on small white trays. I have a personal concierge who called me two days before I arrived to ask if I needed anything. Book a suite, and they even will pick you up in a limo from the airport. My studio room cost $258 a night, including resort fees and taxes, about $200 more than a regular room at the Monte Carlo, which can start as low as $49 a night. \nAnd guess what? Las Vegas is actually full of these secret hotels. Caesars Palace has the tiny Nobu Hotel inside its vast white edifice. MGM has the Skylofts, a separate small hotel within the blocky blue exterior of its massive resort. Mandalay Bay has the Four Seasons. \nWhy do they do it? Snob appeal. \nThe Monte Carlo is a huge, beige resort wedged next to the kitschy New York New York Hotel. It caters to the budget-minded. So why pay for Hotel 32? Well, you get your own elevator, and that's cool. I also sweep past the long check-in lines into the hushed VIP room, where they check me in in two minutes and call me \"Mrs. Creager.\" Upstairs, they have a lounge with snacks and breakfast so you don't have to mingle with the riffraff below. \nAnd isn't that the whole point? To avoid the riffraff? Except that in Las Vegas, it turns out to be sort of boring to sit in your expensive hotel room staring out the window on the 32nd floor instead of wandering amid the riffraff below, who seem to be having a whole lot more fun than you are. \nWAYS TO SPEND \nWhether you stay at a secret hotel or not, Las Vegas has many ways to part you from your money. Here's what's new: \n-- This year, 36 day-club resort pools are open to non-guests, and 12 have topless, adults-only hours or sections. Admission is often free for women -- but up to $40 for men. Nightclubs also cost men more. \n-- The average show ticket price is now $85.20, according to analysis by the Las Vegas Advisor, with the highest price for Donny & Marie at the Flamingo (top ticket $310). Look for the duo to return to Vegas this fall, as will Celine Dion at Caesars Palace. Mariah Carey entertains this month. \n-- As usual, gaming halls will burn through your cash faster than a fire in a bank vault. Gaming was down about 3 percent between November and April, according to the University of Nevada Las Vegas Center for Gaming Research. Still, the Strip alone takes in a jaw-dropping $500 million a month in gaming revenue. \n-- Your funds will dwindle further as you wander the shopping malls, halls and restaurants. The Linq shopping district in the center of the Strip is now fully open. The Strip now has shops from high-end to lowbrow to, yes, even those selling books (OK, typical titles I saw were \"Dude, You're Getting Married\" and \"Hangover Cures,\" but hey, at least they're books). Vegas experienced record revenue from nightclubs, retail, entertainment, alcohol and restaurants last year. \n-- Hotels may offer deals, but watch out for those relentless, additional mandatory \"resort fees\" of up to $30 a day, plus taxes, tips and even charges for water (yes, I accidentally drank an $8 bottle of \"premium\" Fuji water in my room one night when I fumbled for it in the dark). \nAt any rate, like every other Vegas visitor, pretty soon, you'll have just a few measly dollars left. Whether you spend it on a boutique hotel, show, the slots, a gift or a taxi back to the airport, that's up to you. \nWAS IT WORTH IT? \nSo was it worth it to stay at the exclusive boutique hotel? Yes and no. Hotel 32 (about $250 a night) is a bargain compared to MGM's Skylofts (about $900 a night), so it was certainly a reasonable choice. It was quiet. It had beautiful teal drapes and furniture. The service was excellent. But glamorous? Not really. Not enough to make the extra expense worthwhile. \nAt any rate, experiencing a true snob moment in Vegas sometimes is more a matter of chance than money. \nOne night, taxis were few, but I heard that a group of people getting into a long black limousine were looking for one more person headed to the Mirage Hotel -- and that was me. I jumped in, quick as a rabbit. And guess what? It turns out one couple actually knew singer Michael Jackson and had worked for him at Neverland Ranch, and now I was in a long black limo with them speeding down the Strip, brushing arms with the late king of pop's close personal former employees, and feeling like almost, sort of, like a star. \nSECRET HOTELS IN VEGAS \n-- Book Hotel 32 directly with the hotel only ( www.hotel32lasvegas.com , 844-479-4625, rates starting at $177-$401, depending on room you choose). \nHow do prices for the secret hotels stack up against those of their mother resorts?
