The survey is distributed to senior staff within TTF’s membership organisations and other leading tourism businesses around Australia.\nRelated Posts Queensland tourism operators to learn the latest trends of digital marketing New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 TTF: Cruise ship industry – a political football Tourism campaign to entice UK youth to Queensland TTF – Strong Qantas Vital To Australian Aviation and Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:34:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
