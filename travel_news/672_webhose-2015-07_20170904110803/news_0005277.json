Little wonder when you consider how economical they are to run. The financial benefits are an important consideration – particularly as the electric oven is one of the most expensive appliances we use, while a slow cooker uses just a little more energy than a traditional light bulb. The Centre for Sustainable Energy estimates that cooking a meal in an electric oven uses two kilowatt-hours. Using a slow cooker for a full eight hours uses just 0.7 kilowatt-hours. What does that mean in pounds and pence? Electricity costs around 15p per kWh, so using an oven for two hours will cost about 60p, depending on the temperature. A slow cooker, which uses around 0.7kWh over eight hours, will typically cost just 10.5p. You can see how much you save by changing cooking methods if you have a smart meter display installed. Smart meter user Maureen, from Lincolnshire, says: “We’ve had our smart meter since February. I keep the display in the kitchen and check it all the time – it’s really interesting to see what we’re spending as we go along. We’re much more economical than we used to be.” Flavour saver It’s not just the reduction in energy costs that makes slow cooking cost-effective. When you cook food slowly – in particular meat – you can use cheaper ingredients. Professional chefs have long known the worth of less popular cuts, such as chuck, brisket and chicken thighs, which can be more flavoursome than their more expensive counterparts as long as they are cooked properly. That is because muscles that an animal uses most often – such as the shin or shoulder – are the toughest. They are streaked with connective tissue, but if you cook them slowly enough, that collagen breaks down and becomes deliciously tender. Meanwhile, root vegetables, which are mostly cheap and readily available, taste especially sweet after a long, slow braise. And because of the way slow cooking extracts so much flavour from the meat, which in turn permeates the whole dish, you can have less of it and bulk up with vegetables instead. Time saviour There is another saving to be made by using a slow cooker, and that most invaluable commodity is your time. Many slow cooker recipes, particularly soups and stews, require little more effort than throwing all the ingredients in, switching it on and then setting a timer while you go off and do something more interesting. Meanwhile, your evening meal gently simmers away without needing so much as a stir. You could fry off some onions beforehand, and sometimes it’s a good idea to brown your meat on the stove, but as any slow cooking aficionado will say, both are far from essential. Quick and easy: Assemble your dinner, relax and let the slow cooker do all the hard work Slow cooking also means you can get ahead of yourself by preparing everything, or at least most of what you need for your slow cooker meal the night before. Tips to help ensure a tasty end result include placing root vegetables, which take longer to cook than meat, on the bottom of the pot where they are closer to the heat source. And always opt for cooking at lower temperatures for longer where possible, so that the slow and gentle heat really brings out the flavour. Also, do remember that because your slow cooker will have a tightly sealed lid, the liquid won’t evaporate – if you’re adapting a standard recipe, reduce the liquid by a third so that it only just covers the meat and vegetables. And remember, no peeking – every time you take the lid off you release some of the heat, which will add to the cooking time and therefore the cost. And there's more... There are other ways to reduce cooking costs: “sit cooking” is a method where foods are boiled for a short time before being removed from the heat and left to continue cooking in the hot water. It’s an easy way to cook eggs – simply place them in a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and then remove from the heat. For a perfectly soft-boiled egg, allow to sit for five minutes. You can use this method for cooking new potatoes. Keep them boiling for five minutes before letting them sit for another 15. The same principle applies to any vegetables. Just make sure you have tight-fitting pan lids or the water will cool too quickly. One-pot meals are another way of saving both time and energy. They’re cheap on electricity because you don’t have several pans on the go at once, and kind on the cook, with minimal cleaning up afterwards. And if you do use the oven for a roast or stew, pop in a couple of trays of cakes or biscuits around the side to make full use of the heat. Finally, if you’re thinking about investing in a wood burner, look at getting one with a built-in hotplate: that way you heat your home and can also gently cook a stew on there at the same time. Just remember to give it a stir every so often so it doesn’t stick. Three top money-wasters in the kitchen 1. Kettle Three-quartersof British households over fill their kettles, wasting £68 million annually. Boiling only what you need could save you £20 a year. 2. Dishwasher Almost all the energy goes into heating the water. Washing dishes at 30 degrees instead of 60 degrees could save you £75 a year. 2. Taps Dripping taps waste enough water to fill a paddling pool each week. Fixing them could save you £18 per year. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:54:28.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
