Far ahead my husband’s bike light glimmered through the dense pines. Suddenly he stopped and waited for me. “Cherie, can’t you go a bit faster?” Guy said rather anxiously. Later, I learned that a boar had just crashed through the woods in front of him.\nWild pigs aside, biking along the forested, level trails of France ’s southwestern Atlantic Coast feeds a fluid frame of mind conducive to indulging in simple pleasures like the aroma of pine resin; the crush of sunshine in a clearing; the impulsive detour to a waterfront chapel; or a lengthy, wine-enhanced meal without worrying about Breathalyzer-wielding gendarmes.\nEven so, I used care in planning our bike journey last summer around Arcachon Bay, a kind of Gallic Cape Cod-meets-the-Hamptons, an hour’s drive southwest of Bordeaux. Fifty miles in five days seemed ideal, leaving plenty of time for visits to fishing hamlets and wetlands, and for exploring the belle époque in Arcachon, the bay’s nexus, where Europe’s fin de siècle high society built fanciful Victorian mansions in the shadow of the mile-and-a-half-long Great Dune of Pilat, Europe’s highest sand dune, which stretches along the bay like a huge white Band-Aid. Finally, as my husband’s local cousins noted, by biking we’d avoid summer traffic on the road leading into the Cape side of the bay, often jammed by “outsiders” (Parisians and other wealthy vacationers) who, over the last decade, have joined the bling-averse folks from Bordeaux and environs who have traditionally summered on the windswept 15-mile-long spit of land between bay and ocean.\nContinue reading the main story Slide Show Slide Show | 8 Photos Wheeling Around a Tranquil Bay Wheeling Around a Tranquil Bay Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times\nEven so, I had to dangle a bribe to my speed-loving husband who, like others who hail from the land of the Tour de France , seems genetically programmed to get from one point to another posthaste. “When we return,” I promised him, as he gazed longingly at the gleaming rental scooters parked outside Locabeach, the bike shop opposite Arcachon’s gingerbread trimmed train station. For now, my plan was to rent the cushiest-seated bicycles possible, load our gear in saddlebags and head for the pier, where we’d hop the small ferry (named L’Embellie, or the “Lovely One”) for the half-hour chug to the Cape. Then we’d begin riding back to our starting point.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story As the ferry pulled out, sailboats and catamarans swooped by. In the distance, clusters of wooden stakes poked above the water, marking oyster beds, including the one Napoleon III, who began the tourist boom here when he visited Arcachon in 1859, named after his Empress Eugénie.\nOn this limpid, sunny day my eyes could almost take in the entire triangular-shaped bay, from the muddy tidal flats at its back to the sifting sand banks at its mouth. It was les vacances, and even the small dogs in carrying cases were relaxed. I convinced my deeply tanned bench mate, Jo Brousse, who had been “coming here for years,” to divulge her favorite spots, which included Chez Hortense, a family-owned restaurant at the Cape’s point. “It’s an institution,” she said. “People from Arcachon boat across for dinner. Order the turbot.”\nThe prospect of turbot was irresistible, even though it would mean a 10-mile round trip from the B & B I’d reserved in Le Petit Piquey. But it was late July and we had no schedule.\nAlong the smooth, well-marked bike path, the air was spicy and hot, full of buzzing cicadas. Our only concern was avoiding pinecones and giving way to the handful of spandex-clad cyclists on the trail. Emerging from the forest path on our way to Chez Hortense, we pedaled for a mile or so along the two-lane road and headed around the Cap Ferret lighthouse, named after the main village (which is not to be confused with the better-known Cap Ferrat on the Riviera), and along the hollyhock-lined lanes toward the bay front oyster shacks.\nAt the end of a dirt path we leaned our bikes against a fig tree. Barefoot girls in sundresses and boys in shorts played tag in a sandy lot while their parents sat on the waterfront decks of oyster shacks sipping wine and hovering over platters of bivalves on rustic wooden tables. The Great Dune, iridescent in the sun’s glow, anchored the far side of the water. Soon, we were sampling our own oysters, which were so fresh they contracted from their silvery shells under a spritz of lemon juice. Corks were still popping when we tore ourselves away at 9.\nSigns for Hortense, posted at crossroads in the ramshackle neighborhood of coveted vacation cottages around the point, led us to the restaurant. The fact that the owners of the BMWs, Mercedeses and vintage convertibles out front were among the patrons gathered on the beachfront veranda didn’t detract from the friendly service or the attention of Bernadette, the founder’s aging granddaughter. I suspect running a 100-year-old legacy that’s persevered despite violent tides, tempests and even requisition by the Nazis as their local cafeteria imparts humility. Even the perfectly baked turbot comes from a long tradition, according to our waitress, who said the purveyor, in Brittany, has supplied the restaurant since 1936.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The next morning we hit the Cap Ferret market. On previous visits, I’d noticed the high-quality merchandise at the outdoor stands: Basque table linens, espadrilles and Turkish cotton foutas (used here as beach towels). This time, I headed inside past butchers, fishmongers and fruit stalls straight to Chez Pascal, generally regarded as the best bakery on the Cape. I stood patiently in the long line and ordered a half-dozen “White Dunes” — addictive, bite-size cream puffs sprinkled with powdered sugar and named after the bay’s landmark. All this biking was definitely “opening up my appetite” as Guy so delicately put it.\nPhoto A view from the top of Cap Ferret lighthouse with Arcachon Bay and the Great Dune of Pilat in the distance. Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times The next leg of our journey had a historic twist. A friend from Bordeaux had put me in touch with Sabine Lesca, whose great-uncle, Léon Lesca, was a philanthropic real estate mogul of the area in the mid-1800s, when he used some of his fortune to develop the Cape and build a legendary Moorish-style mansion and chapel inspired by his love of North Africa.\n“When I was a child in the 1950s, we’d spend the whole summer here at Grandmother’s house, barefoot all day, helping the oyster farmers and swimming,” Ms. Lesca reminisced as we strolled through the sandy alleys of Le Petit Piquey and l’Herbe, two preserved fishing hamlets, mostly consisting of clubhouse-size pine-plank cabins, and once her family’s stamping grounds. “There was no running water then, and they’d call us back for dinner with a hunting horn,” she said. “My great-uncle’s Villa Algérienne was our landmark, with its green cupola and colored windows.” Sadly, the villa was demolished in the mid-1960s, but the bay front Chapelle Algérienne, now a national monument restored to its polychrome glory, remains.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “The bay inspired Laurent de Brunhoff to write “Babar’s Visit to Bird Island,” Ms. Lesca said, as we stood in the chapel’s front archway, looking out toward the island. Colorful wooden flat-bottomed fishing boats called pinasses were beached on the glossy mud. “Jean Cocteau wrote here, too. Now, Marion Cotillard lives behind the chapel,” she continued, “and Philippe Starck has a house nearby.”\nLooking at her watch, she brightened. It was 11:30 a.m. “Would you like to join me for some oysters?” she asked.\nOnce we were sufficiently fortified, we pedaled around to the back of the bay, stopping at the Cabane du Résinier, a one-room eco-museum in a former resin tapper’s hut, where we learned that the pine forest’s “black gold” provided livelihoods for many through the 1960s. As we proceeded through salt marshes and past the working-class town of Arès toward Andernos-les-Bains— the back of the bay’s commercial center — the sea, sand and sun vibe gave way to the lively community fabric of year-round residents, many of whom work in Bordeaux.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story We didn’t stop at the pier (one of the longest in France, at 761 feet) with its bistros and bars, but headed straight for the recently restored 11th-century St. Eloi Church, one of the area’s oldest buildings, on the foundations of a fourth-century Gallo-Roman villa. Outside, artists had set up easels under the shade of parasol pines. Inside, the stone floor was splashed with shards of color from light streaming through contemporary stained glass windows.\nWe wanted to linger in Andernos, exploring the neighborhoods of vacation cottages and gabled houses trimmed in red, blue or green, with names like Mon Repos, Primavera and Fantasia. We would have enjoyed a glass of wine at the newest tapas bar, Loft 33, which we passed on the trail. But we had an evening date with the birds at our next stop, 15 miles away.\nThe 9 p.m. sunset bird safari turned out to be a highlight of our trip. “Arcachon Bay, and the marshy delta here, is like a huge, self-service hotel-restaurant for over 300 species of migratory and nesting birds throughout the year,” Anne Parisot, a naturalist and guide for the Teich Bird Reserve, told our group at the park entrance. “Here you’re on one of the world’s main bird migration routes,” she continued, speaking above an occasional heron screech.\nPhoto Oyster farm cabins in L'Herbe. Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times After we ogled the huge storks nesting in the tree branches, the rest of the tour was like herding cats. Birders are an independent bunch. So if they hear, say, the bluethroat’s song or spot a kingfisher or a spoonbill, you’d best raise your binoculars and get comfortable because they’re not moving from the path or bird blind (there are 20, along three miles of trails) until they get their fill.\nThe next morning we headed for the coastal bike route skirting the sleepy ports leading to Arcachon. Before lunch, I visited the excellent oyster heritage museum in Gujan-Mestras. Guy hung around Dubourdieu, the Hermès of boat builders, founded in 1800, where two young guys fussed over a stunning custom-built yacht constructed of mahogany and white oak.\nLater, in Arcachon, after an easy ride past the town’s port bristling with boat masts, and along the crowded beachfront sidewalk, I made good on my scooter promise.\nIn fact, I was glad to be on a scooter instead of a bicycle as we sped up the winding roads to Arcachon’s Winter Town (as opposed to its beachy Summer Town along the bay), with its hundreds of Victorian-era villas in a pastiche of belvederes, balconies, palm trees and mimosa high above the water. The back lanes and overgrown plots of this residential neighborhood, founded in 1862 as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients, opened a portal to another era when doctors believed consumption could be cured by the bay’s maritime air, and wealthy European invalids believed in the restorative power of Champagne and a night at the quarter’s Moorish-style casino.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Across a footbridge we found the St.-Cecilia Observatory, a fragile-looking 80-foot-high steel tower built, with the help of Gustave Eiffel, in 1863. We climbed the stairs and watched the sun fall, spectacularly, across the bay and behind the Cap Ferret lighthouse where we began our ride. Lights along the coastline began to twinkle, leading to the ocean’s wild expanse. Watching the seawater rush through the bay’s narrow neck, I thought of Baudelaire’s words, inscribed on a building I had noticed in the old town port earlier in the day: “Free man, you will always cherish the sea.”\nDespite the magnificent view, we didn’t linger. It was time for the aperitif.\nIf You Go Bike rental outfits, trail maps, itineraries and cycle-friendly lodging are available at bassin-arcachon-velo.com.\nPhoto A sailboat in Arcachon Bay. Credit Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times Where to Stay Lovely small hotels, like La Maison du Bassin, lamaisondubassin.com (doubles from 140 euros, about $152 at $1.08 to the euro), on the less-developed Cape side of the Bay fill up quickly, especially in the popular summer season. Bed-and-breakfasts — like the Cap’acabana, capacabana.com (from 90 euros), a hilltop aerie with swimming pool — are a good option, as is La Cabane de Pomme de Pin, chambres-hotes-cap-ferret.com (from 200 euros). In Arcachon, upscale Hôtel Ville d’Hiver ( hotelvilledhiver.com ) is in the restored 19th-century waterworks of the city’s atmospheric hilltop Winter Town (from 140 euros). A more basic nearby option is the Hôtel Marinette, hotel-marinette.com (from 45 euros).\nWhere to Eat Chez Hortense (Avenue du Sémaphore, Lège-Cap-Ferret; chez-hortense.fr ; dinner around 50 euros) is a local seafood institution. Our favorite bivalve feast, though, was at Cap au Large (Port de la Hume, Gujan-Mestras, 33-5-56-66-18-12; seafood platters, 22 euros), a seafood purveyor and casual restaurant on the picturesque Port de la Hume owned by Sophie and David Dupuy, whose families have been oyster farmers and fishermen for six generations and who will also take you out to their oyster beds in the bay.
