The Isa, or individual savings account, is one of those few great joys in the world of taxation. It is a place where any income or capital gains is tax-free. That is the case when you withdraw money from it as well. How does it work? Each tax year, every adult has an Isa allowance, which runs from 6 April. This is a set sum of money that we can put into an Isa. For 2015-16, it is £15,240. The previous year, it was £15,000. You have to use the allowance in the tax year in question. Cash savings continue to offer poor interest rates, while stocks and funds have their risks In recent years, Isas have become even more flexible. You can keep any mix of individual shares, funds and cash in them. You can buy online, from a broker, or from a fund manager. There is yet more flexibility on offer. You can transfer existing Isas freely, but always ask your new provider to deal with this. You can also switch your holdings between stocks and shares or cash. There are also junior Isas that operate in a similar way, but with smaller allowances. Cash savings continue to offer poor interest rates. Moving money into stocks and funds is clearly an option because they offer better potential returns. There are, however, risks: shares and funds can fall in value as well as rise. An Isa could be a good way to try investing. If you have any doubts or want to know more, it is always best to speak to an independent financial adviser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T23:17:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
