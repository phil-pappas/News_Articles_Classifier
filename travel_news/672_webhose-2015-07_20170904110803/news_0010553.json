Like someone going through a tough break-up, I’ve kept this new and beautiful prospect at an arm’s length. \nI’ve been in Istanbul for over a month and I’m just now getting settled. For the first few weeks in town, I rarely even picked up my camera. \nI went out, ate food, and aimlessly wandered around the city. I didn’t talk to many people back home, and I didn’t make an effort here. I was lost. \nNepal hit hard. Saying goodbye to those people was difficult. \nI travel the way I do because I want to be a part of something. I want to get a sense of how local’s feel, and try to understand these foreign places on a deeper level. \nThe biggest problem with this lifestyle choice however is saying goodbye. \nI grow attached through genuine relationships, and as a result, when it’s time to leave, it hurts. \nSometimes I wish I were more like other travelers, and just pass through a place, see the sites, collect good Instagram photos and check off another country. \nLike sleeping around, it’s fun for a while but eventually the lack of substance and intimacy would bore me to death. \nThe more I travel, the more I realize that this life is about people, not places. \nAnd it’s for that exact reason why each new adventure has become increasingly difficult. \nHow would you feel if you knew that the relationships you started came with an expiration date? \nWould you protect yourself and your feelings more? Would you grow colder? \nI know social media makes it easier than ever to stay connected, but nothing compares to being present. \nAnd the only answer I have to “why does there have to be an expiration date” is the ultimate internal battle between ambition and relationships . \nThe devastation we witnessed in Nepal , and bonds formed as a result, were no doubt the most dramatic I’ve ever experienced – but this isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way. \nFeeling cold and detached is a topic I’ve been trying to write about for a long time. \nSaying goodbye to amazing people has made it harder for me to meet new ones. This includes leaving family and friends back home for months on end. \nOn this trip to Istanbul in particular, I’m crippled by the thought of leaving again, and I question the point of getting too involved here. \nThat’s not good. I’m stuck between not being present and not wanting to get too attached. \nI know relationships come and go, and that’s a part of life, but I’m pushing the action at a much faster rate than normal. That’s because my success with this social experiment called Tourist2Townie.com is directly related to the connections I’ve developed while living abroad. \nSo, what’s the point? Besides the therapeutic act of writing this down, where do we go from here? \nI guess my biggest concern is that the people I’ve “left behind” don’t know how much they mean to me. \nEach and every relationship has been unique, and they’ve all been either a blessing or a lesson. \nI don’t look back very often, but every now and then it’s good just to see who got you here. I cherish the memories I’ve made with the people I’ve been so fortunate enough to meet. \nThey’ve all helped me develop into the person I am today, and they inspire me to do more. \nI strive to create a life filled with substance, based on authentic relationships and experiences. \nAs for my time in Istanbul, I’m sure this uninspired feeling will subside. I wont let this opportunity be hindered by my precautions… \nI’ve started meeting people through pick-up basketball, and just last weekend I shot a crazy food video with a great group of local friends. \nI just hope, while I’m constantly traveling and forming new bonds, that the people in my life, both past and present, understand how grateful I am.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
