It looks fantastically bucolic. And it’s right by one of those celebrated French villages, the ones where it’s still 1957, no one locks the doors and neighbours are forever popping round with green beans and apricot jam. You are going to have a splendid time. It will, though, be better yet if you adhere to a few guidelines.\n■ DO lock the doors.\n■ DON’T rely on the neighbours for vegetables and preserves.\n■ DO say “ Bonjour, monsieur/ madame ” when, as the neighbours haven’t come through with beans and jam, you are obliged to go to the village shops. A generalised greeting on entry is de rigueur . It will dispose other customers and the shopkeeper well towards you. (No need for handshakes or kisses: they would be deemed premature, insane even.)\n■ DON’T faff about in the shops. Know what you want and check beforehand how to say it", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T20:10:17.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
