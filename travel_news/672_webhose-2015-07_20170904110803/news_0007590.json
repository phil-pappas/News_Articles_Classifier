This week's column looks at both of these areas, topics that have resulted in a number of recent questions.\nFew people in Canada had even heard the word Uber a couple of years ago as it was growing elsewhere into a large and formidable company challenging the traditional concept of taxi services.\nCP\nIn May hundreds of taxi drivers protested against Uber by blocking a main traffic artery in Mexico City. \nUber is a transportation service that uses local drivers in the communities they serve to take customers from point to point at a fraction of the cost of a traditional taxi. It uses such a sophisticated software program the company has tried to argue it is a technological solutions company to get around local laws governing taxi boards. I have had many questions relating to how travelers can book Uber when they travel, as well as complaints about why it is not available here.\nUsing the service in other cities is a relatively easy process to follow. First you sign up for Uber online at uber.com. You will need to provide your credit card number as this is the way all charges are made. When the process is complete you will be given directions on how to install one of the apps used to book transportation once you start using the system. Once you have downloaded the app you will be asked to verify your password and identity the first time you go online with it. Pinpointing your exact location for pick-up is important, as is being outside at that location when the car arrives.\nUber is a well-structured company. Customers can choose from a variety of vehicle types with different prices per minute and kilometre between choices. Although there has been opposition to Uber's arrival around the globe -- mostly by traditional taxi services -- it would appear the Uber model is here to stay. There are, however, clouds on the horizon.\nWhile Uber has tried to position themselves as a technology company and therefor not regulated by the same rules applying to taxi services, most view this argument as suspicious at best. In a recent California labour commission ruling it was concluded because the company was involved in every aspect of the operation, they could be forced to pay drivers employee benefits including vacation pay and disability insurance. As independent contractors the drivers are responsible for coverage should there be a serious accident leaving passengers with injuries, or dead. A number of jurisdictions have kept Uber out by insisting each driver would have to obtain a taxicab license issued by the local taxi board.\nThe Manitoba Government has made it quite clear they are not interested in opening the door to Uber in any way at this time. The increasing demand for this popular service may prove to be hard for the NDP government to ignore. At the present time, Manitoba's Taxicab Act is written in a way that drivers who operate without a proper license can face fines up to $500 for the first offense, with rising fines for subsequent violations. Yet interestingly, Winnipeg has the second lowest per capita service of the major cities in Canada with only six cabs per 10,000 people. Calgary, as an example, has more than double that number.\nConcerns and complaints about taxi service here and abroad are always appearing in my inbox, as are concerns about car rental policies.\nA few months ago CBC television did a major expose on the Budget Rent a Car franchise in Vancouver, alleging misappropriate charges for damages and related repairs. Nothing was done about this practice from a government perspective. In Europe, however, under the threat of EU Commission enforcement, the five major car rental companies have come to an agreement that will be a major improvement in customer service. Avis-Budget, Sixt, Hertz, Enterprise, and Europcar have all agreed to the new policy changes. The major points include, improved transparency when booking online, clearer information about all mandatory charges and optional extras, clearer information about key rental terms and requirements, better information at the booking stage, exclusions and applicable excesses, improved and more transparent fuel policies, clearer and fairer vehicle inspection processes and improved practices for taking additional charges from customers, meaning consumers are given a reasonable opportunity to challenge any damage before any payment is taken.\nThese are all voluntary actions by companies who recognize the threat to have even tougher regulations thrust upon them was near at hand. These policies would never have been needed if the car rental industry hadn't abused consumers. Around the world there are few jurisdictions standing in the way of car rental companies abusing these very policies with deception and small print contracts the consumer only discovers after there has been a problem. Whether by taxi or by rental vehicle, the consumer deserves better from the companies that supposedly serve them.\n\nRon Pradinuk is president of Journeys Travel & Leisure SuperCentre and can be heard Sundays at noon on CJOB.
