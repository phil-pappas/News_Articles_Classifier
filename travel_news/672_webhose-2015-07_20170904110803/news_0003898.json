After being detained, she had later unsuccessfully attempted to appeal the verdict, although she was released on bail the same day, the NMC said. \nThe Dh10,000 fine was paid in July before the deportation order was issued and Magi was sent to Bangkok as her \"destination of choice.\" \nThe Australian had been teaching graphics design to Emirati women in the capital after having lived in the country since 2012. \nA statement issued by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said: “Ms Jodi Magi … was sentenced for a cyber crimes offence. On July 12, Ms Magi presented herself to a court in Abu Dhabi to pay a court ordered fine and was taken into custody pending deportation to Australia. This is normal practice in Abu Dhabi.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T04:34:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
