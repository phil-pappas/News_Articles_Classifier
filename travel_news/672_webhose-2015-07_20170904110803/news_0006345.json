(AP Photo/Spyros Tsakiris) 0 of 0 By ALAN CLENDENNING The Associated Press \nATHENS, Greece — In a middle-class Athens neighborhood full of boarded-up storefronts, customers lined up at the Rizos Bakery on Monday to inhale the lovely smells of fresh bread and emerge with loaves still warm from the ovens. Co-owner Alexandros Rizos stood behind the counter and worried whether he would have to lay off workers, or whether his 15-year-old business might go under. \nGreece secured a third bailout Monday that averts financial catastrophe but hits some of its already struggling citizens hard. \nRizos, 36, who owns the small bakery with his brother, said the deal serves up a double blow: Greece’s sales tax on food looks likely to rise from 13 percent to 23 percent — meaning he’ll have to raise prices for already struggling customers — and the deal liberalizes laws to let many more businesses open on Sunday, something that favors big chain stores because many small businesses like Rizos’ can’t afford to open seven days a week. \n“They’re calling this bailout the third package of help for Greece, but I could get hit at least two ways,” Rizos said. “I don’t know if my customers will still buy here or end up going somewhere else.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:51:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
