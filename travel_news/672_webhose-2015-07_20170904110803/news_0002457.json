Maraschino liqueur is a heritage spirit made from the Veneto region’s signature stone fruit and has become a cult bartender’s favorite on both sides of the Atlantic. \nItaly’s Luxardo family has been bottling the stuff for nearly 200 years. In 1821, Maria Canevari Luxardo, the wife of a Genovese ex-pat living in northern Croatia, started using local cherries in homemade rosolio maraschino, a sweet Dalmatian liqueur. By 1913, Luxardo Distilling had grown into the largest liquor operation in the Austro-Hungarian empire. When fourth-generation distiller Giorgio Luxardo emigrated to Italy in 1946, he relocated the family business to Torreglia, a postcard-ready village of rolling hills and red-roofed convents in Veneto. \nThe fifth and sixth generations now cultivate and harvest some 20,000 trees growing Marasca cherries, a sour variety bred exclusively by la famiglia Luxardo. Their orchard blooms in late spring and early summer, after which they harvest and age the fruit for two years in larchwood vats. The resulting brew is distilled in small copper pots, aged an additional year in Finnish ash wood, and then sweetened, spiced and bottled for global distribution. \nTall, straw-wrapped bottles of Luxardo Maraschino liqueur are now staples at plummy cocktail dens worldwide, eclipsing other fruit liqueurs — not to mention the jarred cherries bartenders liberally apply to Manhattans or Shirley Temples. \nGran Caffe Piemme , a buzzy spot in posh Padova, Italy, uses it alongside local wine and amaro in a punch-like house creation called Kilometer Zero. In San Francisco, The Mystic Hotel’s Burritt Room pairs Luxardo Maraschino with smoky mezcal and nutmeg bitters in a tiki-esque Death March cocktail. At Manhattan’s Death Co. , the liqueur spikes house creations like No Shade in the Shadows, a brandy-based drink made with Domaine D’Esperance Blanche armagnac, pineapple-infused Tanqueray, vermouth and absinthe. \nSeattle has claimed the prohibition-era Last Word cocktail as its citywide signature. Made with equal parts gin, chartreuse, maraschino liqueur and fresh lime juice, the Last Word is the trademark tipple at Downtown’s Zig Zag Cafe , while local bar star Jamie Boudreau serves a rosemary-infused version at his trendy Canon bar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:03:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
