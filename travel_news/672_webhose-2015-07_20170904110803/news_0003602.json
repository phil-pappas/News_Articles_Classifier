Revellers at the 'Chupinazo' celebration. Source: AFP \nA SEA of revellers decked in red and white have sprayed wine on each other in a packed Pamplona square to kick off Spain’s famed San Fermin running of the bulls festival. \nThe nine-day street party got under way at midday with the cry “Viva San Fermin!”, followed seconds later by the firing of a firecracker known locally as the “chupinazo”. \nCrowds wearing traditional white outfits trimmed with red neckerchiefs and cummerbunds drank from traditional leather wine pouches and sprayed red wine on others. \nOthers poured wine from balconies overhead. \nFive giant outdoor television screens were set up at other points in the city centre and aired the event live. \nPamplona is located just south of the Rioja vineyard region and wine has for centuries played an important role in the celebrations, which commemorate San Fermin, the city’s first bishop and patron saint.

A run takes just under four minutes on average. It was a messy party. Source: AP \nDozens of daredevils are admitted to hospital each year. Most of the injuries are not caused by bull horns but by runners falling, or being knocked over and trampled by the animals. Revellers pack out streets.

It got really raunchy.

The vast majority of bull run participants are men. Two women wear the traditional red scarf.

It’s hugely popular. Source: Getty Images \nPamplona city officials refused to provide an estimate for the number of visitors expected in the city of 300,000 residents this year.
