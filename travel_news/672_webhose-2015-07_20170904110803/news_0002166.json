The movie giant is scheduled to open its Shanghai park in the spring of 2016, featuring Tomorrowland , Treasure Cove and Mickey Mouse adventure sections, designed to bring the Disney brand to middle class Chinese families. Characters from Starwars and Marvel comics will also appear. Disney is partnering with local Chinese developers to build the 20-square-kilometer, $5.5 billion project which represents the company's largest ever foreign investment. Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that he hopes to blend the Disney experience with authentic, Chinese culture and is optimistic about China's future prospects.While showcasing the designs in Shanhai, Iger told the crowds that the park \"not only showcases the best of Disney's storytelling but also celebrates and incorporates China's incredibly rich heritage to create a one-of-a-kind destination that will delight and entertain the people of China for generations to come.\"The development comes amid investor concerns about China's economic slowdown. Though Disney has had a good track record with movie releases in China, many of its animated characters are not well known in the country. The park will also have to compete with the new Universal Studios theme Park being constructed in Beijing. The Disneyland complex will also include international shopping, hotels, an ornamental garden and dining experiences. Disney stocks were up on the news of the project. Disney opened a Disneyland resort in Hong Kong ten years ago. Last year the park received about 7.5 million visitors, 48% of whom were from the Chinese mainland. Disney executives say they have learned valuable lessons from the Hong Kong park, which struggled with long lines and food supply issues when it first opened.
