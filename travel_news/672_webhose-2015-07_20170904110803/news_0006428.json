I would have Quote: d her portentuously: \"The body can endure compromise and the mind can be seduced by it. Only the heart protests.\" And how my heart protested, after I had made a negotiated agreement with a girl in primary school and was royally shafted. Unable to compromise, Angela lost a friend (Alamy) This girl had been trying to woo away my long time best friend, Caroline, but we reached agreement that we would each play with Caroline alternate days. Only my competitor used her time to put my friend off me altogether. • We must stop ignoring the over-50s And so compromise, allowing for a middle way, became a dirty word, the ultimate sign of flabbiness of the soul, lack of clear conviction, of giving in easily for a quiet life. For a very long time through all manner of social and romantic engagements whether it was what film to see, where to go on holiday, whether a partner and I were putting equal effort into our relationship, I have been uncompromisingly clear that it was my way or the highway. I still feel bad about the time, some years back, that I went to the developing world with a photographer friend to report on a story she had part researched and wanted me to get published. I got a commission with a prestigious colour supplement and we did the story. Compromise, if not the spice of life, is its solidity. It is what makes nations great and marriages happy. Phyllis McGinley Later it was nominated for a journalistic award and I was to be named as the writer. My friend was angry that she was not given equal billing but I argued that I had done the reporting and writing, and that being seen to have done this story, as a journalist, this mattered to me professionally. She had sold photographs on the back of a commission she would not have got herself and been recognised for these. I would not ask for her to be named alongside me as she insisted she should be. She succeeded in persuading the organisers to put her name on the catalogue, but she was not invited to the evening. Although the article was one of three finalists it did not win. Nor did my erstwhile friend and I speak again. I look back now and think how much better it would have been to mind less about my journalistic profile, and more about the pleasure there had been in the friendship, and tried to find a happy way for both of us. Angela and her husband often compromise (Andrew Crowley) I cannot pinpoint when my intractability shifted, but it has something to do with maturing, ageing, seeing that life is too short for the pyrrhic victories that too often result when you’ve got your way and wrecked a friendship, the atmosphere with a lover, a working relationship, as a result. Writing my book on some of the positives of ageing ( The Year I Turn… A Quirky A - Z of Ageing , Gibson Square) I found myself trilling how much happier I have been since deciding to channel Mark Twain’s wise observation that: \"if you don’t mind, it doesn’t matter\" and choosing to let many small fry issues over which I’d once have done battle, go. With the result that my counterpart tended to be much sweeter than if I had been so thoroughly unrelenting they had given me my way. My husband is an altogether more accomodating beast since I have allowed for his wishes over mine at times, or sat down and discussed how we might both come out OK with a negotiated solution. Hey, we’ve even ended up laughing instead of inflicting another wound into the fabric of our togetherness. • Who really buys vinyl? The answer will surprise you And if we turn to the font of synonyms Roget’s Thesaurus, we learn that compromise means: bargain, concession, pact, accommodation, understanding. Or as Phyllis McGinley had it in A Short Walk From The Station:’Compromise, if not the spice of life, is its solidity. It is what makes nations great and marriages happy.’ • Davina McCall: How I keep my husband happy The secret to a happy marriage? Compromise (Fox) And working relationships considerably more viable if the compromise engineered just the other day between my publisher and I. We were well set for a head on, eyes fiery, voices raised, adrenalin beginning to pump over publication date and how best to organise media interest for a new book, written with my son, to be published early summer. Somehow we managed to see the incongruity of what was going on and give each other time to explain, without being interrupted, why they felt as they did . But I can see how easily it could have been a very hollow victory with one of us stepping down, teeth gritted, disappointment at feeling forced to concede what seemed the wrong way. And we shook on it, acknowledging happily what a good compromise we had reached. • Tricks and tips to attract wildlife to your garden Yet for all that therapy insisting on the value of talking, listening and coming to terms has had considerable success in helping many of us ease up on blaming another for refusing to meet our needs - in that hideously overworked phrase - emotional intelligence is all too often kicked underfoot . You hear compromise talked of as a sell-out, loss of soul and substance, the ultimate way to become oppressed and depressed. And yes, of course, there are things that define our identity and integrity and which we cannot and will not compromise over. And the same will be true of our nearest and dearest. But if we insist only on these being the bottom line and explain why they are so essential to us, it may be that we will be heard in a way that cannot happen if we behave like a tantrum-ing kid over every tiny thing. These days I have pinned to my psychic wall something I once heard a couple of therapists living together, explaining that they say to each other: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?’ Follow @TeleGoodLife Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T10:35:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
