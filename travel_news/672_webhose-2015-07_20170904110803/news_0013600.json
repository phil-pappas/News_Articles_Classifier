That self-made deadline has passed. Related Content See All Homes of the Day The state Department of Transportation expects to get an updated schedule from the contractors in the next two weeks. The $3.1-billion project is already more than two years delayed because the giant tunnel-boring machine, nicknamed Bertha, broke down in December 2013. Built by Hitachi Zosen of Japan, Bertha had to be shut down a little more than 1,000 feet into its 1.7-mile underground journey.
