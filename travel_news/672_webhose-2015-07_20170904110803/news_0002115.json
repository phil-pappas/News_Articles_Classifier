Ahead of the 50+ Show at London's Olympia , a study by Retirement Move has found that this is the time when we are generally mentally agile enough to be able to deal with the buying and selling of property. According to the study of 1,000 people aged over 60, this is the age when downsizing and the ridding of unused space, extra rooms or difficult to manage gardens pays off best. Is it moving time? (Alamy) Seven in 10 of those questioned said they would feel young enough to make the most of a new property at this age, being easily able to settle in without burdening their children. The study also found that half of over 60s admit they struggle to maintain their property, and a third find it hard to keep on top of their garden. Jennie Bond's retirement tips Richard Drew, CEO of Retirement Move, said: “The results show that people want to make the most of later life and sometimes they can be restricted in that due to being tied to a property they struggle to fill or maintain. \"The prospect of moving home is daunting whatever your age but downsizing at the right time can help avoid years of struggling to manage a larger space or feeling overwhelmed with your current property. Moving at the right time means retirees can get the best out of their new homes, ensuring a focus on living a fulfilling and enjoyable time of life, rather than worrying about property maintenance or upkeep for a place that’s no longer suitable.\" The study brings to the fore the idea that life really does begin at 60. “Part of planning for retirement is not about the ‘end’ but about new beginnings,” Drew added.
