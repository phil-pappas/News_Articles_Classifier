United Airlines is in the midst of negotiations for a labor deal with 24,000 members of the Association of Flight Attendants, but those negotiations appear to be bogged down at the moment. An open letter posted on the flight attendants union’s web site , cited by Crain’s Chicago, argued that the negotiations have taken far too long to complete, and that “the parties are far apart on key issues.” It’s not precisely clear from the letter what those issues are, though the post says, “The bottom line problem is the company’s unwillingness to put the required economic resources into a Flight Attendant Contract.” Crain’s noted that both sides are seeking to reach a deal by July 23 , but without an agreement the union has now announced plans for a July 16 “day of action,” though a spokesperson did not explain what that action might be. That report pointed out this isn’t the only union deal United (NYSE: UAL) is negotiating at the moment: notably, the airline is also trying to reach a deal with maintenance workers represented by the Teamsters. \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
