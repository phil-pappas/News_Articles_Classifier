It's a giant nautilus shell featuring 30 monumental fish figures. A new Tiffany & Co. Foundation Woodland Gardens will surround the carousel.\nThe not-for-profit Battery Conservancy says the carousel was designed to recall The Battery's history as the original home of the New York Aquarium.\nThe design allows visitors to \"sit within\" the luminescent fish figures instead of riding them as one would a typical carousel.\nThe carousel and gardens are part of a major revitalization of the 25-acre public park that includes new pedestrian and bike paths, perennial gardens and restrooms. The work is nearing completion.\nAbout 6 million people visit the park annually.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:02:43.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
