The Dictionary of Economics defines it as “the study of the production, distribution and consumption of wealth in human society”. According to the Bristol-based Economics Network , it’s about choices and the impact of choice. It’s a very traditional degree that prepares people well. Economics will never shut doors Economics is a social science with a technical core. Students of the subject will first grasp the use of maths and statistics before moving on to psychology, anthropology, history, politics and more. Students go on to pursue a suitably varied range of careers. As economics graduates, actress Cate Blanchett, former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss and Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger would all be comfortable chatting about supply and demand, balance of payments or income distribution. “It’s a very traditional degree that prepares people well. Economics will never shut doors,” says Gillian Murchie, careers consultant within the social sciences faculty at the University of Nottingham . Economics is associated with wealth and how it is created and lost, and graduates of the subject tend to do very well. Combination courses are popular, but employers also value a pure degree The latest figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that economics graduates are among the top graduate earners, with a median salary of £24,000 - behind only doctors, dentists, vets and engineers. At Nottingham, 85.3 per cent of economics graduates found graduate-level jobs six months after graduation; slightly higher than the 81.2 per cent national average. Combination courses, such as economics with languages, econometrics or international politics, are popular, but employers also value a pure degree. Some courses focus on behavioural economics, which might lead to work within digital marketing As well as acquiring the more generic graduate skills, economists are comfortable analysing a wide variety of data, abstracting and simplifying a problem, understanding economic theory and modelling approaches, knowing how to apply economic reasoning to policy data – and other specialist skills prized by commerce and policy makers. “It really does keep choices very open,” says Murchie. “Some courses focus on behavioural economics, for instance, which might lead to work within digital marketing or brand management.” The roles listed below are just a small sample of potential careers, and the universities mentioned are just a few of the many that offer economics and associated degrees. Courses vary between universities, so it pays to delve into how and what you will be taught, and by whom.
