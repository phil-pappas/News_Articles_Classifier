The signings of Yohann Cabaye (£3.6m) and rumours about the arrival of Charlie Austin will fuel fans’ expectations that they can improve on their 10th place finish. The midfield trio of Bolasie (£3.6m), Puncheon (£3.7m) and Zaha (£3.3m) will attract a lot of TFF attention and there is plenty to recommend them, especially as their TFF prices are broadly in line with last season. Both Bolasie and Puncheon broke the 100 points barrier and were 19th and 20th best value for money midfielders. I expect to see them there again at the end of this season. Pardew has addressed the fact that they looked a little light up front with the season-long loan of Patrick Bamford (£3.8m). He had a cracking season last year on loan at Middlesbrough scoring 17 times. Dwight Gayle (£4.0m) was Palace’s top TFF striker last season with a relatively disappointing 78 points. Glenn Murray (£4.2m) returned from Reading and netted 7 times in the second half of the year, but no forward started more than 17 games and this is a negative for me. One for the shortlist: Scott Dann (Defender £2.8m). All the hype last season was elsewhere leaving Dann to quietly accumulate 116 points. He ranked the 9th best value for money defender and the TFF handicappers have looked on him kindly. Palace fans knew a good thing though as they voted him player of the season. One to avoid: Marouane Chamakh (Striker £4.0m). Scored 4 goals in 20 appearances last season but is injury prone and has missed large portions of both of the last 2 campaigns so best avoided.
