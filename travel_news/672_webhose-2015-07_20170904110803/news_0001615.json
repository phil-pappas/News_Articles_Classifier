In order to welcome the filming, two special marquees were constructed on the Town’s Green and fitted out with kitchen equipment. To get the semi-finalists into the spirit of the day, they arrived in style on a horse and cart and explored the historic streets, cottages and shops.\nPaul Gossage, Director of Marketing & PR explains: “It’s not every day that I receive a phone call asking if I want eight celebrities to cook lunch for our volunteers, and I quickly realised that this was a wonderful opportunity for the Museum. A few weeks later we were given the good news that the production company wanted to film here, and the actual day of the filming was great fun with a wonderful atmosphere around the town.”\nThe eight celebrities hoping to follow in the footsteps of last year’s champion Sophie Thompson, are: actor Scott Maslen; actor and presenter Sheree Murphy; soul singer and presenter Mica Paris; Pussycat Doll and television personality Kimberly Wyatt; singer (The Wanted) Tom Parker; singer songwriter Chesney Hawkes; TV presenter (and one half of the presenter duo ‘Sam and Mark’) Sam Nixon and TV presenter, personality and singer Rylan Clark.\nBlists Hill Victorian Town has often been used as a film location, for a variety of programmes including Dr Who, The Antiques Road Show, The Victorian Pharmacy and even a Christmas music video. Appearances on shows that are watched by millions of viewers are an excellent way to raise the Museum’s profile and attract more visitors.\nPaul Gossage concludes: “The 70 volunteers who were treated to the specially prepared lunch thoroughly enjoyed their meal and seeing behind the scenes of MasterChef. Fans will have to watch the show to find out what was on the menu and which dishes proved to be the most popular.”\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Record number of US runners register to compete in Cuban Marathon ‘Marabana’ Are redundancies ‘a normal part of business’?
