PUBLISHED: 10:56, Wed, Jul 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:06, Wed, Jul 22, 2015 CATERS NEWS AGENCY ALIEN INVASION: The tents could make you think aliens have landed their UFOs on Earth \nThe treehouse architect says he became fascinated with trees at the young age of six after watching a BBC documentary about the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. \nAlex, 38, from Tottenham, North London, said: “When I saw the Amazon deforestation my heart hurt. \n\"I knew the only way trees would survive was if they were valued for more than just timber. I knew I had to build treehouses.” \nIn 2001 Alex began working as an apprentice by day on fixed treehouses for elite clients. By night, however, he would continue working on his mobile treehouse dream. \nHis dream became a reality when he teamed up with talented tent designer Kirk Kirchev, 40, to create Tentsile – the spooky but environmentally friendly tents. \nAlex said: “He joined my crusade and together we brought the vision to life in a practice, lightweight and super-desirable way.” CATERS NEWS AGENCY FASCINATING & PRACTICAL: These tents could also save us when the zombie apcolypse comes \nThe pair sold the first Tentsile in 2013, called the Stingray. Since then, Tentsile has gone on to quadruple online sales by the beginning of 2015. \n\"It's more than just a tent in trees it's adventure, secrets, playfulness, mystique and flat-out 'cool factor' manufactured out of nylon. It makes it possible to camp just about anywhere, without a rock in your back no more searching for flat ground. We're pretty sure it'll hold up great in the zombie apocalypse, too! Alex Shirley-Smith \n\"It's an escape in a bag. \nAlex also explained that the benefits of Tentsile go far beyond the fascinating factor of being cool to look at. \nThe tents keep warm bodies off cold grounds and lessens environmental impact. \nFurthermore, it’s practical for campers. \nAlex explained: \"It makes it possible to camp just about anywhere, without a rock in your back no more searching for flat ground. \n\"We're pretty sure it'll hold up great in the zombie apocalypse, too!\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:57:43.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
