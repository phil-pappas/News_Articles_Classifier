More Indian cricketers cleared of charges \nIt previously offered 110p per share on July 9, in partnership with Amaya . But Bwin was uncomfortable with the complexity and uncertainty of the GVC/Amaya bid, and chose instead to recommend a 104.09p per share offer from 888 on July 17. \nIn response, GVC has now parted ways with Amaya and announced it will take a €400m loan from “affiliates” of Cerberus Capital Management to help fund the Bwin bid. GVC’s market capitalisation is roughly £262m. \n“We have been talking with Cerberus for quite some time. They have been involved for months,” said Kenny Alexander, GVC chief executive. \nGVC said that it would need to raise £150m through a further share issue to fund restructuring costs, but pledged significant cost reductions from the proposed combined business. GVC said in a statement that “cost reductions exceeding €135m per annum would be achieved across the enlarged group by the end of 2017”. \nMr Alexander said he had been shocked by Bwin’s decision to endorse 888 ahead of GVC, adding: “888 were there and we were not quite there, but we were progressing well. We would have got there but they took the decision they took.” \nBut, he said, Bwin had encouraged GVC to return to the table and several Bwin shareholders had been dismayed by the board’s recommendation of the 888 offer. \n“To be fair to them, they left the door open. They were keen for us to return. A number of shareholders were keen for us to return and this morning we have returned,” he said. \nMr Alexander added that GVC and Amaya had parted on good terms. “With two parties involved, it is less straightforward than with GVC going alone. We were still keen to proceed with the transaction and to remove some of the complexity that the Bwin board had worried about.” \nBwin acknowledged the new GVC offer and said the proposal had not yet been finalised for formal consideration by the board. \nBrian Mattingley, the executive chairman of 888, said: “I will consider our options when there is a proper offer on the table that we believe adds value to the shareholders over and above our bid.” \nJason Ader, an activist investor who owns 5.19 per cent of Bwin through his SpringOwl vehicle, said he was planning to meet GVC this week to discuss the offer. “The timing of this announcement is because Kenny Alexander really wants to take this to the investors directly.” \nHe said he expected significant board representation for Bwin shareholders if the deal were to go ahead. “The issue is that Bwin shareholders are going to own 80 per cent of the shares of this new company and GVC 20 per cent. We need to have board seats that represent something close to that.” \nAnd while Mr Ader said he would be willing to take a significant proportion of GVC shares, he said the premium on offer would have to be higher. “There is a lot of risk and I am not sure I am getting paid for that,” he said. \nShares in Aim listed GVC closed 1.87 per cent down at 420.5p. Bwin shares rose 2.85 per cent to 111.7p. Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:21:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
