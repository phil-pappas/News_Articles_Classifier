This is due to a single airline controlling the majority of seats at 40 of the top 100 US airports. \nIn addition, the US big three airlines - Delta, United and American - have reduced service at, or abandoned altogether, hundreds of airports across the country. At the same time, the US Department of Justice is investigating whether those same airlines have been illegally coordinating their capacity growth on domestic US routes in an effort to maintain pricing leverage over consumers. Recently, some 28 class action lawsuits have likewise been filed across the country claiming the same illegal activity. \nIt is against this backdrop that the big three have been waging a war on US Open Skies policy in general and Norwegian Air International and Gulf carriers, Etihad Airways, Emirates and Qatar Airways, in particular. These US carriers have corrupted a US Open Skies review and approval process that should have resulted in approval in weeks of Norwegian Air International's application to fly to underserved US airports - in accordance with the EU-US Open Skies agreement. Instead, the big three have politically blocked the carrier's application for 16 months depriving consumers of new air service alternatives. Similarly, the big three have been waging a multi-million dollar campaign to block further Gulf carrier new entry into US markets. \nSo, while the big three have deserted many mid-size community airports, and are under antitrust investigation for illegal coordination to keep fares high, they arrogantly fight hammer and tongs to prevent foreign airlines from providing commercial air services to and from international destinations that they themselves refuse to offer. These US airports and communities desperately need new foreign airline entry to replace lost big three air service and to add new connectivity to unserved foreign destinations. \nSince the US airline industry has been radically consolidated, the big three have acted aggressively to undermine price transparency, consumer protections and domestic and foreign carrier new entry. It is time that US regulators connect the dots and take action to protect competition and the consumer from the big three's anti-competitive policies and to enable communities to develop their economic bases and generate new travel and tourism-related jobs. This interference by the big three in the free market is harming Americans and is offensive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:45:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
