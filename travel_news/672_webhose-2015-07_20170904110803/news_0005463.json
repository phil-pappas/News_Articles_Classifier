It was 15 degrees Fahrenheit outside in Nome, Alaska. Among the diners clad in goose down and fleece was a woman wearing sealskin pants, her sealskin coat with fox fur trim tossed on the back of a nearby chair. She held up a ginger ale.\n“Here’s to Suzanna, Marc and Loren and Matt of the Alaska Dispatch,” she said, toasting the reporters and photographers who had been following the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race over frozen rivers and tundra and icy seas.\nThis was Alice Rogoff, 63, wife of billionaire David Rubenstein and a former Washington business executive turned owner and publisher of Alaska’s largest newspaper. Rogoff had spent nine days piloting her single-engine Cessna 206 from village to village as her reporters covered 70-plus mushers crossing the state.\nA Chinese restaurant near the northwest corner of the continent might seem an incongruous setting for a onetime Beltway insider often seen at Kennedy Center galas and nonprofit board meetings. But Rogoff, a petite woman with blond-streaked brown hair, seemed in her element. Since her first visit to Alaska in 2001, the intensely private businesswoman and philanthropist has spent more and more time here, starting an arts foundation, buying a house, earning a pilot’s license to more easily traverse the immense state, purchasing a Web site, establishing an organization to address Arctic Circle issues, then buying the former Anchorage Daily News. Yet for someone who has generated so much news, there has been remarkably little published about her.\nHer rising profile in Alaska, her marriage to one of the country’s most successful private-equity managers, and the physical and metaphorical distance from her life — and husband — in Washington have made observers in both places curious about her ambitions.\nShe, however, is more comfortable talking about Alaska and the environmental and economic challenges facing it.\n“This place is my second home,” she told me the next morning, sipping coffee in a cozy cottage she had rented for herself and her team. “But in 200 years, this could all be under water.” Nome, a city of 3,800 souls 400 miles from the state highway system, is at an elevation of only 20 feet. “Like Miami,” she said, “it may soon be gone.”\nHer favorite topic: the rest of the country’s glaring misperception of Alaska as “a frozen wasteland.”\nIf global warming has a ground zero, she believes Alaska is it. The northernmost latitudes are warming twice as fast as other parts of the globe, causing the thawing of polar ice, which leads to shifts in the jet stream, which leads to glaciers and sea ice melting at record speeds. The rising sea levels and retreating coastlines, she likes to point out, are creating expanded shipping channels, something she urgently believes Alaska should capitalize on.\nAfter coffee, she and her reporters climbed into a black pickup and headed through town on snow-packed roads to a bazaar at Old St. Joseph’s Catholic Church — now a community hall — where a host of Alaska Natives were selling their wares. As Rogoff wended her way through stalls piled with ivory tusks, jewelry, bear skins (she bought a few) and soapstone carvings, the crafts people greeted her by name. Next, she crossed the street for lunch at Airport Pizza, a hangout for mushers. While Rogoff and her crew seated themselves, Jessie Royer, the fourth-place Iditarod finisher — and top female — entered and nodded at them.\nSnow was so sparse at the Iditarod’s traditional takeoff point near Anchorage that for the second time in the race’s 43-year history, the start was moved north to chillier Fairbanks. Rogoff recalled her first visit to the race’s finish in 2002, when a pilot flew her to Nome.\n“Planes could still park on the sea ice back then,” she said, as if remembering a bygone era.\nAlice Rogoff with husband David Rubenstein at a Kennedy Center gala in September 2012.

(Photograph by Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\nThe future newspaper publisher grew up in Nutley, N.J., the middle of three girls.\n“She was very independent and adventurous,” said Alice’s mother, Sheila Rogoff, a 92-year-old artist, in an interview. Alice loved to bike, ride horses, ski and play the flute, her mother said. “She was good enough to go professional, but her brain was on politics.”\nThe family was well off; Alice’s father, Mortimer Rogoff, who would later establish Navigation Sciences in Bethesda, Md., invented technologies that contributed to the development of GPS systems and cellular telephones. Alice lived in Paris as a teenager, then attended the prestigious Dalton School on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. She received her BA from Connecticut College and an MBA from Harvard before landing a job as an assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Carter administration.\nIt was there she met Rubenstein, an ambitious lawyer two years older than she, who served as the aide to White House domestic policy adviser Stuart Eizenstat. Rubenstein was known for his long hours and his vending-machine diet, as well as for his talent for ensuring his memos were on the top of the pile in President Jimmy Carter’s inbox.\nAs Rubenstein told Washington Post reporter David Montgomery for a 2012 Style profile: “She figured out one of my tricks that you probably have heard of. The president had the Oval Office, but he had a little office off to the side that he used, and that’s where his real inbox was. I would go in and put my memos on top … and I’d leave at 1 in the morning. And then one time she figured out what I’d done or was doing, and she put [OMB’s] memo on top and the president read it first. He went their way, and I got so mad I didn’t talk to her for a couple months.” The two wed in May 1983 and settled in Bethesda. She was 31.\nAfter the Carter administration, Rogoff was an assistant to then-Washington Post publisher Donald Graham, spearheading the creation of the national weekly edition. In 1985, she became chief financial officer at U.S. News and World Report. The publication’s then-executive vice president, James Glassman, remembers her as a workaholic who returned to the office 10 days after giving birth to her first daughter, Alexandra. “She was there at all hours,” he said, “constantly engaged, always cheerful.”\nMeanwhile, Rogoff’s husband was casting about for a post-White House career. In 1987, he co-founded the Carlyle Group, which would become one of the largest private equity management firms in the world. One of his earliest successes involved taking advantage of a loophole in the 1986 Tax Reform Act that allowed firms owned by Alaska Natives to sell off their tax losses to corporations in search of write-offs. Carlyle raked in millions in fees, in what critics referred to as “the Great Eskimo Tax Scam.”\nAs the firm grew, it recruited senior statesmen as partners or advisers — including former defense secretary Frank Carlucci, former secretary of state James Baker and former president George H.W. Bush — and set about investing in defense contractors. These moves would attract charges that it helped former pols cash in on their connections and conspiracy theories that it profited from the 2003 Iraq war. The firm eventually broadened its portfolio beyond military contractors and now manages almost $200 billion in global assets across a dizzying array of sectors, including agriculture, transportation, natural resources, mining, aerospace, automotive, energy, health care, information technology, real estate and retail.\nThe Bush and Rubenstein families traveled together, and the Bushes were among the prominent visitors to the compound the Rubensteins eventually built in Nantucket. (The couple also purchased the house next door to their Bethesda residence, converting it to a guesthouse, and property in Beaver Creek, Colo.)\nRogoff had another daughter, Gabrielle, then a son, Andrew, in 1991. “She had a nanny all that while,” her mother said, “but those kids were very active.”\nWith her husband absorbed in Carlyle, Rogoff quit U.S. News in 1997 and began to work from home. Rogoff and Rubenstein formed Rhodes Partners, a venture capital firm that focuses on Internet-related companies (at one point, the company invested in a local Internet software firm that included The Post among its clients), and she joined the board of several high-profile organizations, including the Carter Center in Atlanta and the National Symphony Orchestra.\nBut Barbara Overstreet, a friend whose children attended the Potomac School in McLean along with the Rubenstein offspring, said in an interview that Rogoff remained “authentic and passionate” about her convictions.\n“She was never the socialite,” said Overstreet, who is now director of development for the Potomac School. “She always preferred small gatherings with intelligent people rather than massive parties.”\nIn a 1998 article in The Washington Post, part of a series about changing gender roles, Rogoff said she had worked through her regret that she wouldn’t be a CEO.\n“My motivation is not to make a huge rate of return but to be part of something interesting,” she said. “Money, professional recognition, I’m finding you can get all that without the big company. ... Wherever this road takes me will be fine.”\nEventually, it would take her to Alaska. And, she recently wrote in an e-mail to me, “what began as a lifelong dream to see and experience Alaska became a deep wish to throw myself into the life here.”\nRogoff introduces Ray Riutta of the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute at an event held at Alaska House in New York City in May 2009. (Photograph by Thos Robinson/Getty Images)\nRogoff was introduced to Alaska in 2001, when she decided to celebrate her 50th birthday by taking a trip there with Overstreet and their children. It was the first of what would become many visits. “Learning Alaska takes time,” Rogoff said last fall, speaking to journalism students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where I teach. “I feel like maybe I am finally making sense of it. And then it changes.”\nIn 2002 Rogoff and Overstreet asked a pilot to fly them along the course of the Iditarod, which their sons were studying in school. They touched down in Athabascan Indian villages in Alaska’s interior and the Yukon River delta, and Inupiat villages along the shores of Norton Sound and the Bering Sea.\n“The ice was melting so much earlier in the season than before,” Overstreet said. “Houses were falling into the ocean. It was central to every conversation early on.”\nWhen the families returned that summer to visit remote St. Lawrence Island, about a 160-mile flight from Nome, Rogoff met Alaska Natives trying to sell their art. “She fell in love with it,” recalled Pat Hahn, a Nome resident who befriended Rogoff. She soon realized, he said, that “if you buy their art, it helps their economy.” Suspecting that profits generated in high-end shops weren’t being passed to the artists, Rogoff decided to try to link buyers and sellers directly.\n“Alice had her work cut out for her,” Hahn said. Though Rogoff wanted to move to Nome, he said, he and his wife discouraged her. “She needed a bigger puddle than Nome. Anchorage was perfect for her.”\nRogoff established the Alaska Native Arts Foundation in Anchorage and purchased a house there in 2006. She seemed to see herself as Alaska’s unofficial ambassador to the East Coast. In 2005, the foundation set up a three-day festival at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington; a few years later, it established a 3,000-square-foot gallery named Alaska House in Manhattan’s Soho district. “We specifically chose higher prices in New York,” said Overstreet, who serves on the board. “We had $25,000 pieces,” plus baskets woven from seal intestines, moose bladder pouches and walrus intestine raincoats. The goal was to get fair-market value for the art and serve as what Rogoff called a “virtual embassy of Alaska.”\nAlaska House opened on Sept. 15, 2008, with a standing-room-only crowd that included Todd Palin, husband of then-Gov. Sarah Palin; financier Steve Rattner; philanthropist Daisy Soros; hedge fund manager Orin Kramer; Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass; and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Unfortunately, Lehman Brothers went under the same day. Rogoff’s plans to raise $1 million a year to operate Alaska House evaporated, and her efforts to secure an $875,000 grant from the state legislature were unsuccessful.\n“Most members of the Alaska legislature had not spent time on the East Coast and didn’t understand why it was good to have people on the East Coast understanding Alaska,” she told me recently. “And I am not a born supplicant. That is not my strength.”\nBy that time, Rubenstein had made generous donations to the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, Duke University and the Lincoln and Kennedy centers, as well as purchased a $21.3 million copy of the Magna Carta to be displayed at the National Archives. (He would later also help fund repairs to the Washington Monument after the 2011 earthquake.) “I’m not sure if legislators and the governor will say this out loud,” wrote then- Fairbanks Daily News-Miner columnist Dermot Cole, “but they will want to know why Rogoff and Rubenstein don’t fund the Alaska House with their own money.”\nRogoff rejects that logic. “Nothing in my life in Alaska is about my husband,” she told me. “Nothing in his professional life is about me.” She closed Alaska House in July 2010, though she remains on the board of the foundation, which runs a two-room gallery in downtown Anchorage.\nBut, as Rogoff says of herself, “I don’t have the ability to turn my brain off.” And, especially with her children now grown, she was determined to make a life in Alaska. “Those of us lucky enough to be in good health and financially independent will find that we have many more chapters of life to live after our children leave the nest,” she said in an e-mail.\nRogoff at a meeting at the Alaska Dispatch offices. (Loren Holmes /Alaska Dispatch News)\n“The ice is almost gone,” says Rogoff. “There is an ocean there.” (Gene Thorp/The Washington Post)\nRogoff had already tried to establish an Alaskan arts television network and was musing about starting a Web site that would focus on underreported stories about the 49th state when she was introduced to the three journalists behind a year-old online news organization named the Alaska Dispatch. An hour of conversation over buffalo burgers, a handshake and an agreement inked on a napkin led to Rogoff’s purchase of 90 percent of the Dispatch in July 2009. “She gave us this amazing opportunity to open offices and hire ... a team of people willing to take a risk,” said Tony Hopfinger, who had been running the site out of a spare bedroom. Over the next five years, about 30 reporters and sales staff came onboard.\nThe financial risk was all Rogoff’s, according to Hopfinger, who declined to disclose the amount Rogoff paid. “It’s patronizing to think Rubenstein is behind all this,” he said.\nThe budding organization needed a newsroom, so Rogoff arranged for the reporters to work out of offices next to the airport hangar where she housed her Cessna, which she used to search out stories and ferry writers and photographers around the state. Rogoff would drop by the office several times a week and “we’d help her roll her plane out,” said Hopfinger, now president and editor-at-large for the Dispatch newspaper. “It was a very unique place to go to work each day.”\nAbout the time she purchased the Web site, Rogoff told me, she began reading the “brilliant” work of Scott Borgerson, a former U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant commander and Council on Foreign Relations fellow who is now chief executive of CargoMetrics, an investment management firm that specializes in collecting data on global shipping.\nIn several articles for Foreign Affairs magazine, Borgerson noted that the Russians, Canadians, Danish and Norwegians are establishing deepwater ports along their Arctic shorelines, funding new Arctic naval patrol vessels and staking territorial claims on the Arctic Ocean floor. Because the north is a fabulous trove of mineral deposits and the repository of a quarter of the world’s estimated oil and natural gas deposits, he argued, the Arctic region will become a center of trade and commerce akin to the Mediterranean Sea.\nAnchorage and Reykjavik could someday become “the high-latitude equivalents of Singapore and Dubai,” he wrote.\nAnchorage ? Rogoff decided to organize a Dispatch-sponsored conference in 2011 to focus on “infrastructure development, policy needs and economic opportunities in the Alaskan Arctic.” She called it the Arctic Imperative Summit, holding it at a tony ski resort just south of Anchorage, and drawing an impressive constellation of speakers and guests including retired Coast Guard Adm. Thomas Barrett, president of Alyeska Pipeline Service; Iceland President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, whom she had met at a reception in New York; Dan Sullivan, then commissioner of Alaska’s Department of Natural Resources; Rubenstein, representing Carlyle; and Edward Itta, then mayor of the North Slope Borough. One of the 200 attendees, whose way was paid by Rogoff, was Nome Mayor Denise Michels.\n“It was a diverse group and very high-level,” remembered Michels. “Alice has a true investment in the people here, and she’s providing a voice for us who cannot travel. Her goal was to make sure that rural people were there at these discussions.”\nRogoff had another conference in 2012, also including Grimsson. He was eager for Iceland to take a central role in the international Arctic discussion. He and Rogoff decided to combine forces.\nIn April 2013, the two flew to Washington to announce that they were founding the Arctic Circle, a new organization whose first assembly would be held in the glass-paneled Harpa Concert and Conference Center in Reykjavik.\nInstantly, the new circumpolar forum was viewed as a rival of the more tradition-bound Arctic Council, founded in 1996 as an intergovernmental group of eight nations with Arctic real estate: Sweden, Iceland, Canada, Russia, the United States, Norway, Finland and Denmark. Chairmanship rotates among the member nations, and all other participants have only nonspeaking observer status.\nBy contrast, Rogoff’s organization would widen the circle.\n“It’s clear that the Arctic Circle is intended as a high-profile, dynamic conference where India and Google and Greenpeace — and countless others with a stake in the Arctic — need not wait for years hoping they may be allowed to speak,” the Toronto Globe and Mail wrote.\nThe assembly met in Reykjavik again last fall, this time attracting more media and 1,400 people from 34 countries, including heads of state from Finland and Germany . The highest-ranking U.S. representative was Alaska’s Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Not present was Secretary of State — and Rogoff’s Nantucket neighbor — John F. Kerry.\nThough Kerry is chairing the Arctic Council for the next two years, Rogoff fears he’s not invested in Alaska’s future.\n“I don’t think John Kerry has a clue about Alaska and doesn’t care about Alaska,” Rogoff told the journalism students last fall. “And I happen to know him personally, and he’s never been to Alaska except maybe on a refueling stop and has no interest in the place, and for him, the Arctic equals hunting.” (According to the Dispatch, Rogoff herself is a big-game hunter, a fact some East Coast friends find surprising.)\nA State Department spokesman confirmed that Kerry hasn’t been to Alaska but said the secretary plans to host the Arctic Council there in 2017.\nRogoff and the staff of the Alaska Dispatch Web site in October 2012. (Photograph by Loren Holmes/Alaska Dispatch News)\nThe new owner of the Anchorage Daily News meets the staff in April 2014. (Bob Hallinen/Anchorage Daily News) While Rogoff was establishing herself as a player in Arctic issues, the Dispatch had earned plaudits for its coverage of the 2010 plane crash that killed Sen. Ted Stevens, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (which had ramifications for future oil drilling off Alaska) and Sarah Palin. But five years into Rogoff’s ownership, the Web site’s 1.5 million monthly page views weren’t approaching the Anchorage Daily News’ 14.7 million, and online advertising wasn’t generating the hoped-for profits.\nAt the same time, Sacramento-based McClatchy was weighed down by its $4.5 billion 2006 purchase of the Daily News’ owner, Knight Ridder. Rogoff guessed that McClatchy might, for the right price, be persuaded to unload the Daily News, which had a daily print circulation of 51,539 and a Sunday print circulation of 45,783. She offered $34 million for the paper and its building, more than some observers said they were worth.\nShe then sold the building to GCI, an Alaskan telecommunications corporation, for $14.5 million with a rent-back agreement through the end of this year.\n“The amount of revenue we have coming from advertisers for the print edition is 15 times what we get from digital,” she said to the journalism students. “That’s why we bought the newspaper, in one word. It was for revenue. Because we wanted to do more journalism.”\nOn April 8, 2014, McClatchy and the Dispatch cast the sale in terms of reverting the Daily News to “local ownership.” The Dispatch ran a 1968 photo of the last local Daily News owner, Kay Fanning, alongside an article linking Fanning and Rogoff as female publishers who “came home to the North” and wanted to “make a difference in Alaska.” (This 2,062-word piece", "external_links": ["http://fairbanks.uber.matchbin.net/bookmark/4399565/blog+entry-Alaska+House+seeks+support"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:20:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
