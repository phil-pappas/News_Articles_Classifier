Designed by architect and owner Paolo Giambelli in association with design firm Pierre Yves Rochon, the Palazzo Parigi (which opened in 2013) blends Parisian charm and Milanese decor for a picturesque city retreat. Palazzo Parigi comprises 65 capacious rooms—some of which overlook the hotel’s secluded, century-old garden and fountain—and 33 suites. Each room is appointed with marble, original fabrics, enormous glass windows, hand-selected artwork, and private terraces that offer views of the garden or cityscape. \nWhile every inch of the hotel is grandiose, the crème de la crème is the new Presidential Suite, a 2,690-square-foot apartment with an adjacent 1,184-square-foot terrace. Featuring elegant paneling and carefully curated artwork (including The Lions by Hans Schmidt, 1877), the living room is adorned with two sofas, an antique writing table, a 75-inch television, a surround-sound system, and classic rugs. The bathroom, decorated in Calacatta marble, is equipped with a private Turkish bath. Two adjoining rooms can be converted into a private gym, an office, or a walk-in closet, depending on the guests’ needs. Guests can also request a chef to prepare special dishes for any occasion in the suite’s fully equipped kitchen. \nIn addition to stunning views of the iconic Duomo, the Sforzesco Castle, the Church of San Marco, and the Alps—Milan’s most famous shopping districts are located within easy walking distance of the hotel. Nightly rates for the Presidential Suite at Palazzo Parigi start at about $16,000, which includes butler service.
