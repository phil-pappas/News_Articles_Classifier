Free love, rock ‘n’ roll and loads of style – the swinging ’70s are back and how! If you baulked at the idea of wriggling into skinny jeans, the return of the bell bottoms will give you a reason to rejoice while looking chic. These wide-bottomed pants were the epitome of style during the ’70s, and are back in a modern avatar. Be it flared jumpsuits, dungarees or the traditional Americana denim version, here’s how to style them: Footsie fun: While pairing chunky platform heels or wedges with flared pants make your legs look a mile long, you can rock them with flats too. Get the hem a tad shorter to go with ballerina flats or cool canvas sneakers. Find perfect fit: The ideal bell bottom jeans are snug on the thighs and gently flare out after the knees. You can also use a belt to cinch your waist, or opt for high-waisted pair of jeans to accentuate your figure. However, avoid the belt if you are opting for a crop top. Designer Sonia Rykiel presented overalls with wide bottoms styled with striped socks for a nerdy glam look (left). Look lean and chic with stripes all over like reality star Olivia Palermo (Centre).

Avoid wearing loose-fitting, oversized tops with such wide-bottomed pants.
