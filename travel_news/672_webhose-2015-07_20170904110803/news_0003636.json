After long, fractious negotiations, world powers and Iran struck a historic deal Tuesday to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from international sanctions – an agreement aimed at averting the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran and another U.S. military intervention in the Middle East. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) By NASSER KARIMI The Associated Press \nTEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran’s president has pointed to another possible windfall from the nuclear deal with world powers — his country may soon be able to buy badly needed new planes for its aging fleet, the official IRNA news agency reported. \nHassan Rouhani said Iranian negotiators came away from the talks in Vienna with “achievements beyond the nuclear” agreement and succeeded in having “aviation sanctions removed.” His remarks were carried by the official IRNA news agency late Wednesday. \nThe landmark deal, struck Tuesday between Iran and six world powers after marathon negotiations in the Austrian capital, is meant to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability, in exchange for sanctions relief. According to the deal, key economic sanctions — such as those on Iranian energy and financial sectors — would be lifted once Iran implements the restrictions on its nuclear program. \nInternational and specifically U.S. sanctions have prohibited the sale of Western planes and some spare parts to Iran, making it impossible for Iran to buy new planes and difficult to keep the aging Boeings and Airbuses it does use safely flying. The last time Iran bought new aircraft directly from a Western company was in the early 1990s from the Dutch manufacturer Fokker, which later went bankrupt.
