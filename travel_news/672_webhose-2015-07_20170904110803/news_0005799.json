Nah, nah. Two ducks roasted.”\nThese are the words alleged prison murder plot mastermind Frederick Walkuski bragged to a fellow inmate, the Supreme Court has heard.\nFormer Mobilong Prison inmate Wayne Buckingham today outlined Walkuski’s alleged efforts to recruit others into a plot to murder two District Court judges and firebomb the car of a senior police officer.\nMr Buckingham, who is the key prosecution witness in the case against Walkuski and fellow inmate Hendrik van Schaik, told the jury that Walkuski often spoke of his hatred for Judge Paul Rice, who sentenced him to 17 years’ prison in 2009.\nWalkuski, 64, and van Schaik, 43, have both pleaded not guilty to conspiring to murder Judge Rice and his wife Judge Rosemary Davey by firebombing their home and to conspiring to firebomb the car of Detective Sergeant Craig Wall.\nDistrict Court Judge Paul Rice.

Source: News Limited\nMr Buckingham was shown a letter from Director of Public Prosecutions Adam Kimber to senior police, agreeing to recommend a suspended sentence for dishonesty charges in exchange for his co-operation.\nThe court heard van Schaik came into the unit at Mobilong some time later, and agreed to carry out the attacks on Walkuski’s behalf when he was to be released on August 4, 2014.\n“Rik (van Schaik) said on a couple of occasions that he would do the job when he got out,” Mr Buckingham said.\n“Rik said to Fred that if wanted it done straight away he could get his son to do it.\n“Fred asked how young his son was and Rik said about 20, and Fred said ‘no, I don’t want to get anyone else involved’.”\nMr Buckingham said in late June 2014, he overheard Walkuski asking van Schaik if he’d said anything about the plot on a sanctioned phone call.\n“Rik replied, ‘yeah, I said Fred Walkuski is paying me $20,000 to firebomb a cop’s car and a judge’s house. Of course I didn’t say anything, don’t worry Fred, I’ll do it as soon as I get out’,” Mr Buckingham said.\n“Rik needed the money straight away because he’d lost his car and his motorbike, he was going to do both places on the same night because he wanted to get the full amount.”\nMr Buckingham told the jury Walkuski would become angry and animated when speaking of Judge Rice, who he described as an “animal” and “dog”.\nHe said Walkuski once remarked: “I just want the f***ing old c**t dead, he’s just a f***ing animal.”\nOn another occasion, Walkuski allegedly told Mr Buckingham: “I can just see the headline now, Two Judges Burned. Nah, nah, Two Ducks Roasted.”\nThe court also heard van Schaik’s girlfriend had found out where Judge Rice and Judge Davey lived and that Walkuski would pay the money when he saw evidence of the attacks on the news.\nThe trial continues.", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/321916-b4c5a3ca-25dd-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/321372-8489a486-25dd-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/321346-8db826e0-25dd-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T07:25:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
