They’re designed with relatively narrow waists for good grip on hard snow and a quick response from edge to edge. Many of them, particularly at expert level, utilise technologies developed in the racing arena that help reduce excess vibrations to boost stability and improve edge hold while carving at high speed. Intermediate and advanced models are more forgiving at low speed. Piste intermediate Best on test Best value Volkl RTM 75 £350 (including bindings) Best for: Rapidly improving intermediates The RTM 75s achieve the highest scores of the piste intermediate skis for edge hold, long turns, high speed, low speed and groomed piste. They're nice and grippy in all types of turn, but perform slightly better in longer turns. Very stable, their high level of performance is well suited to fast-improving intermediates. Tech talk Wood core incorporated into a cap construction, with tip rocker. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, low speed, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 153, 159, 166, 173 Sidecut: 120/75/105 (all lengths) Radius: 15.2m (166) Women's piste intermediate Best on test Best value Rossignol Unique 2 £350 (including bindings) Best for: Effortless turns with stability The Unique 2s are rated best in the group alongside the Dynastar Active 9s, in all but one of the performance criteria (smoothness, for which they still come second). Really stable but easy to turn, they provide powerful grip, making everything feel effortless. They're best suited to intermediate and advanced on-piste skiers. Tech talk Lightweight, hollowed-out paulownia wood core reinforced with fibreglass. Cap construction with sidewalls in the central part of the ski. Rockered on the front 10 per cent. + Low speed, high speed, long turns, short turns, groomed piste, off piste, moguls, edge hold, liveliness/responsiveness, smoothness, versatility – None Lengths: 142, 149, 156, 163 Sidecut: 120/70/100 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (163) Best on test Dynastar Active 9 £370 (including bindings) Best for: Gaining confidence at slow to medium speeds The Active 9s top this category in all of the performance criteria. Stable and easy to turn, they're fantastic skis that inspire confidence. In slow to medium turns they provide good grip, but are not so powerful in the rebound as to be scary. This makes them excellent piste skis for early intermediates and upwards. Tech talk Cap construction with sidewalls underfoot and a synthetic core. Rockered at the tips. + Low speed, high speed, long turns, short turns, groomed piste, off piste, moguls, edge hold, liveliness/responsiveness, smoothness, versatility – None Lengths: 148, 153, 158, 163 Sidecut: 126/74/104 (all lengths) Radius: 13m (163) Piste advanced Best on test Rossignol Pursuit 600 Basalt £515 (including bindings) Best for: Solidity at speed The Pursuit 600s top this category for long turns, high speed, low speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste and moguls. They're solid on the edge in fast carved turns, with great grip on ice and good rebound. They provide a rapid transition from edge to edge in short turns. Lightweight but solid, they're good for building confidence and experimenting with different speeds and terrain. Tech talk New this season, all Rossignol's race and piste models have longitudinal grooves cut into the top layer near the front of the ski. This is to heighten grip and precision by improving power transfer. Partial cap construction containing a wood core, reinforced with basalt (a mineral with similar properties to fibreglass). Rockered at the tips. + Long turns, high speed, low speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste, moguls – Off piste Lengths: 163, 170, 177, 184 Sidecut: 127/73/109 (all lengths) Radius: 14m (170) Best value Fischer Progressor F18 £500 (including bindings) Best for: Grip and lively rebound These top the group for edge hold, also performing well in low speed, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste and moguls. They're light and easy to pivot, even at low speeds, but super stable once they're on the edge, with plenty of rebound at the end of the turn. When you crank up the speed, they're with you all the way – great for those wishing to improve. And a new sidewall profile, updated from last year's version of the same model, has made their grip even better. Tech talk Partial cap construction, with lower sidewalls than last year's Progressors (meaning a skinnier profile when viewed side on). Wood core strengthened with Fischer's Air Carbon, a lightweight, high-tech material from the aerospace industry. Dual Radius means they have a curvier sidecut at the front of the ski for faster initiation. Rockered at the tips. + Edge hold, low speed, liveliness/responsiveness, groomed piste, moguls – Off piste Lengths: 153, 160, 167, 174 Sidecut: 122/74/103 (all lengths) Radius: 12m/15m (167) Women's piste advanced Best on test Best value K2 Tainted Luv 74 £420 (including bindings) Best for: Putting a spring in your step The Tainted Luv 74s are best of the group for all but one of the performance criteria (long turns, in which they still place second). Fun and poppy, they're light underfoot and turn with minimal effort. They're nippy in short turns, and although they're easy to control at lower speeds, they're also surprisingly stable at higher speeds. They remain solid yet reactive when skied more aggressively. They're perfect skis for intermediate or advanced skiers on a budget. Tech talk Cap construction with sidewalls underfoot. Fir/paulownia/bamboo core reinforced with fibreglass. Rockered at the tips. + Low speed, high speed, long turns, short turns, groomed piste, off piste, moguls, edge hold, liveliness/responsiveness, smoothness, versatility – None Lengths: 146, 153, 160, 167 Sidecut: 121/74/107 (all lengths) Radius: 12.5m (160) Best on test Atomic Cloud 9 £440 (including bindings) Best for: A wide range of speeds The Cloud 9s lead this category for long turns and high speed, also performing excellently for short turns, smoothness and groomed piste. Fantastic for advanced and expert piste skiers, they instill confidence at higher speeds, while remaining easy to handle at lower speeds. They're fun, lively and easy to ski. Tech talk Synthetic foam core incorporated into a cap construction, with partial sidewalls underfoot. A layer of titanium beneath the core improves stability, and the binding is mounted via just one anchor point in the middle of the ski, allowing the ski to flex freely. Rockered on the front 10 per cent. + Short turns, long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste – None Lengths: 142, 149, 156, 163 Sidecut: 128/74/104 (156) Radius: 11m (156) Piste expert Best on test Fischer Progressor F19 Ti £600 (including bindings) Best for: Solidity with a touch of playfulness The Progressor F19 Ti's are strongest in this category for long turns and high speed, also notching up excellent scores for smoothness and groomed piste. They're very light and easy to turn at low speeds, yet also solid in long turns at speed. Well suited to strong, aggressive skiers, they come to life at high speeds, when they demonstrate better grip and more playfulness. Tech talk Partial cap construction, with lower sidewalls than last year's Progressor models (meaning a skinnier profile when viewed side on). Wood core strengthened with titanal and Fischer's Air Carbon, a lightweight, high-tech material from the aerospace industry. Dual radius gives a curvier sidecut at the front, resulting in faster turn initiation. Rockered at the tips. + Long turns, high speed, smoothness, groomed piste – Off piste Lengths: 163, 170, 177, 182 Sidecut: 122/75/104 (all lengths) Radius: 13m/17m (170) Best value Salomon X-Max £560 (including bindings) Best for: On piste and in the bumps, at a variety of speeds The X-Maxs lead the group for low speed and moguls, also scoring strongly for long turns, high speed and groomed piste. They're great on their edges, and perform well at speed. Grippy even on ice, they give confidence when skiing a variety of terrain. When pressed hard they turn quickly, and are agile in moguls. They suit keen piste bashers who love clocking up the miles but enjoy the occasional foray off piste. Tech talk Sidewall construction, with a wood core beefed up by two layers of titanium. Salomon's Powerline carbon shock absorber runs along the centre of the topsheet. Rockered on the front 10 per cent. + Long turns, high speed, low speed, groomed piste, moguls – None Lengths: 155, 160, 165, 170, 175 Sidecut: 120/73/103 (165) Radius: 14m (165) Women's piste expert Best on test Best value Volkl Allura £550 (including bindings) Best for: Strong performance in all turn shapes The Alluras are top of this category for edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste and groomed piste. These powerhouses initiate turns easily and pop out of them, slickly and smoothly. Fun, lively and responsive, they're very versatile at different speeds. They make tiny turns easily, but are also solid at speed, cruising stably through big turns. Immediately likeable and a breeze to ski on, these are ideal for intermediates looking to progress with confidence. Tech talk Cap construction, with a wood core reinforced with steel. They have two ridges running along the edges of the topsheet to boost grip, and are rockered at the tips. + Edge hold, long turns, high speed, smoothness, liveliness/responsiveness, off piste, groomed piste – None Lengths: 144, 151, 158, 165 Sidecut: 125/75/96 (all lengths) Radius: 15.3m (158) • Ski test winners: All-mountain skis • Ski test winners: Freeride skis • Ski test winners: Big mountain skis • Ski test winners: Park & pipe skis • Ski test winners: Hike & ride skis Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T17:53:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
