The coveted honor marks the 11th straight year AlliedPRA has been recognized as one of the Top 25 Destination Management Companies in the industry. \nThe Special Events Magazine Top 25 DMC list recognizes those Destination Management Companies around the globe that intimately know the destinations they serve, while maintaining long-standing relationship with local suppliers to provide unique local destination experiences for meetings, incentives and events. This first-hand knowledge is not something that can be found off the shelf but rather is developed over years of creating program experiences, working within the local destination supplier chain for transportation, tours, activities, themed events, site selection and more. “It is an honor to be recognized every year as a leading force within the destination management industry and named as a Top 25 DMC by this prestigious publication,” said Dornfeld. “As a strategic arm of the industry, we have gone from being called ground operators, mainly responsible for local tours and coach transfers, to Destination Management Experts, creating and executing sophisticated program experiences alongside our client partners. The evolution of meetings and events has been nothing short of amazing and we are excited to see how the industry will continue to advance.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:53:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
