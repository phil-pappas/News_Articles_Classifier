Every year, one business in each of BBB’s service areas – Alaska, Oregon and Western Washington – are selected to receive BBB’s prestigious award. Entries are evaluated by independent panels of influential leaders from the business community. “It is an honor to be recognized for excellence in the marketplace by the Better Business Bureau ,” said Gideon Garcia, Chief Operating Officer of CIRI Alaska Tourism. “Three distinct, but connected groups of people made this happen. First, our customers, who desire, buy, and recommend our products. Second, our employees, who deliver such consistent and superlative customer service to our guests. They deliver the dream. And third, our shareholders, who have invested in us and to whom we owe a superior rate of return. CIRI Alaska Tourism is proud of this accomplishment and strives to exceed every guest’s expectations.” BBB welcomed entries and nominations from all for-profit organizations, regardless of size, from these regions. The BBB congratulates this year’s winners and thanks us for valuing ethical business practices and marketplace trust.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:30:35.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
