He became a model for how to engage with an ethnic community whose residents often struggle with limited English skills.\nDonnie was Chinatown’s eyes and ears. A trusted friend to those within and a guide to those from the outside, especially medics, police officers and firefighters\nWhen non-English-speaking elders felt sick or dehydrated, they bypassed 911 and called Donnie for help.\nFrom the archives\nSee a profile of Donnie Chin that ran in The Seattle Times in 1991 More on Donnie Chin\nInternational District Emergency Center director Donnie Chin was recently honored by OCA-Greater Seattle with a Golden Circle Award. (Photo courtesy of International Examiner) Chinatown ID’s ‘frontline hero’ killed in early morning shooting\nDonald Chin spent life protecting, serving the Chinatown International District Chin remembered as hero, leader, friend\nPolice check witness tips, video for clues (Anyone with tips can call the homicide line at 206-233-5000.) Editorial: Donnie Chin, a neighborhood’s guardian angel, is lost\n Gifts in Chin’s memory Donations may be made on Chin’s behalf to the International District Emergency Center, via the Seattle Foundation’s IDEC page . When property managers heard an alarm go off, they asked Donnie to check.\nWhen police and fire departments arrived at the scene of an incident, they relied on Donnie to relay the victim’s problems.\nAnd when a dispute between rival groups reportedly broke out in the early hours of Thursday morning, they knew Donnie would be there — probably trying to mediate.\nHe had saved so many lives before. But this time, under circumstances yet to be understood, Donnie’s dedication to his neighborhood ended in the worst possible way.\nWhoever shot Donnie to death also may have killed the International District Emergency Center (IDEC), which Donnie ran almost single-handedly on donations and grants.\n“We will never find anyone to step into that role,” says Maiko Winkler-Chin, a friend and executive director of the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority. “Donnie never got married. Donnie lived down here. He never slept. I never expected this to happen. I never expected anyone else to step into that role because we asked too much. And he gave too much.”\nPolice must find Donnie’s killer and seek justice. Anyone with tips should call the homicide line at 206-233-5000.\n“Uncle Bob” Santos, a legendary community elder and activist in his own right, says it’s sad enough to lose an icon. But it would be even worse, in Donnie’s absence, to allow thugs to take over Chinatown-International District’s hard-fought efforts to become a thriving, safe space for all.\n“We have to get more people on the street. We need to revive our businesses,” he reminds us. “And since Donnie isn’t around, we have to look out for each other.”\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
