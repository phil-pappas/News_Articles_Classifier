Lisbon is a city that defies the rules of space. It is more like film set erected by conquistadors of the past. Older part the city, despite being bound up in the mesh of overhead telephone and power lines and criss-crossed by trams, manages to survive the stranglehold to emerge as an open airy city. At the same time, when visitors unfamiliar with the layout of the city first set foot in the narrow streets of the Bairro Alto, streets that to all appearance lead to nowhere, they soon discover a city within a city, a world that could never be divined from outside such a tiny space so high up. The best way to explore the city is to travel around on the city’s quaint old tram system. This is a unique way of getting to know the city at really close quarters. The Electrico provides a splendid seat for city’s Cinema Verite – as long as you’re not in a hurry. Our journey begins in the heart of Lisbon, in the Baixa, or lower city, aboard the Number 28 tram to Alfama and Graca. Rumbling and rattling, it jolts its way uphill past the cathedral (known as the Se) and around the old Moorish quarter of Alfama. A cacophony of mechanical groans is followed by a sudden hiss of air from the brakes and final grinding of wheels; passengers’ heads are jerked forward and the Electrico halts at a small square, the Largo Portas do Sol. The doors at the front and back of the 1930s wood-paneled streetcar fold open. Inside, the only sound is the gentle murmuring of the passengers. The Lisboans, especially the elders, are as frugal with their gestures as they are in their style of dress. They sit there calmly, lost in thought, idly pushing up the streaked windows to open them in hot weather or pulling down the blinds to shield themselves from the sun, just as electrico passengers have done for the last hundred years. We get off at the square and are immediately struck by the breathtaking view: a checkered carpet of thousands of steep rooftops, densely crowded all the way down to the Tagus, interrupted here and there by a few prominent churches gleaming white in the late morning sun. It is said to be the most beautiful view in Lisbon. We get back on the No. 28 tram and continue our journey. The alleys leading up to Graca become incredibly narrow for the Electrico as it curves its way past the battered corners of houses with only a few millimeters to spare. The air here smells of olive oil and dried cod. The displays in front of the food shops are almost within reach; you could easily pat the head of a passerby or snatch a glass from someone drinking at a bar. At the Church of Sao Vicente, we get off again and walk over to the shopping hall called Mercado de Santa Clara. Today (Tuesday) and on Saturdays, a flea market – the Fiera da Ladra (the lady thief’s market) is held outside the hall. Back to the Largo de Sao Vicente, where we resume our journey, this time on the Number 28a. It chugs slowly along to the terminus, where we change to the larger carreira No. 15 to Alges. At the Rossio, the square in front of the National Theatre, we get off and stroll over to the glitzy business district. Back on to the Tram No. 15, which crosses the Praca do Commercio square near the river Tagus on its reverse journey. The square itself, with Romanesque buildings on three sides, horse-borne statue of great son of the soil and long lines of arcades, and particularly its geometrically designed footpath required further exploration. Then, from here, we continue out into the suburb of Beleym. The electrico is overwhelmed by a rush of traffic; once they get behind the wheel, even these most gentle-mannered of all southern Europeans turn into fanatical racing drivers. In front of the Cais do Sodre railway station, a delivery van driver is just getting the last gasp out of his engine, right on the line, and no amount of clanging on the part of the driver is any use. But, patiently we waited as we knew that even without getting off from the tram we would be able to watch almost all important tourist sites in Beleym namely the Hieronmite Monastery, ancient Tower of Beleym and the Monument of the Sea Explorers – all in some way linked to the great maritime past of the country. While returning it was getting late. After a last look out from the Alto di Santa Catarina, one of the best viewpoints over the harbour, the city and the Tagus, we decide not to wait for the old electrico, but jump into a modern Lisbon tram near the monastery to catch our last journey on the Electrico No. 28, from its western end. It was another wonderful journey though Barrio Alto and the grand Estrella district passing through its magnificent Basilica. Tired but with a wealth of impressions of the Lusitanian world, we let ourselves be rocked back down to the Baixa where our journey began. Two little boys have just sprung up on to the running board. But no conductor or policeman is likely to chase them off, for they no doubt did just the same when they were young – less for the sake of saving 2 – Euros than for the pure fun of it.
