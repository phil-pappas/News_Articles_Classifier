The EURâ‚¬150 million plant will be built alongside an existing assembly line for A320s in the northern port city of Tianjin. It will be responsible for completing cabin work on A330s.\nThe contract was signed during a visit by Chinese Prime Minster Li Keqiang to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, along with two other deals on the production of cabin equipment and fasteners for assembling aircraft parts.\nIt came 48 hours after China agreed to buy 45 A330s worth over USD$11 billion, with plans for a possible further 30.\nDespite a slowdown in its economy, China is the world's fastest-growing aviation market and is projected to order a total of 5,300 airliners over the next 20 years.\nAirbus hopes the increased presence in China will lead to more demand for the A330, which is due to be updated with new engines.\nAirbus opened its first non-European aircraft assembly plant in Tianjin in 2009 and extended the co-operation venture with Chinese interests to 2025, in a fresh agreement last year.\nIt also plans to inaugurate another non-European assembly plant for A320s in Mobile, Alabama, in September.\nNegotiations to set up the new wide-body cabin completion facility at Tianjin took longer than expected, partly due to a trade row between China and the European Union over airline emissions that was settled last year.\nThere were also tough negotiations over the number of planes to be purchased by China in exchange for the factory investment.\nAirbus had originally hoped to more than double its existing Chinese fleet of about 150 A330s by offering a regional version especially tailored for the domestic market.\nAirbus has been locked in a fierce battle with Boeing for that slice of the busy Chinese market.\nBut the current agreement for 75 jets, which could eventually be raised to around 100, ensures continued production of the A330.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:04:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
