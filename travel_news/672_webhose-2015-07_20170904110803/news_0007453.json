The contemporary and elegant hotel features upscale accommodation, a modern lobby lounge and fine dining at Tarsila Restaurant. Situated in the heart of Sao Paulo city, the hotel is ideally located one block away from the banking and arts district on Paulista Avenue. Local attractions within walking distance include the Sao Paulo Art Museum and the tranquil Trianon Park. \nGreen Globe congratulates the InterContinental Sao Paulo on its recent re-certification and dedication to sustainable best practices. The hotel achieved an outstanding compliance score of 90% against accredited criteria. \nFrancisco Garcia, General Manager at the InterContinental Sao Paulo said, “It is with great pride that our entire team associates sustainability practices with our business KPOs and being re-certified by Green Globe is very rewarding. From the front line to the back line employees, Green actions are undertaken throughout our hotel and integrated into our routines. This higher awareness has brought greater respect to our company not only within our community but also amongst our competitors and stake holders.\" \nThe InterContinental Sao Paulo works with Green Engage, IHG’s own global sustainable program to devise green strategies that encompass the hotel’s overall management and operations. The IHG Green Engage online system measures energy, waste and water use. This information is then used by hotel management to set reduction targets for each area. \nAs part of its energy and water saving strategies the Intercontinental Sao Paulo encourages guests to participate in its linen reuse program. While paper waste is reduced with Pressreader where guests are provided with free access to more than 3000 news publications on their own devices or by using the hotel’s iPads. \nTo reduce its impacts on the environment the InterContinental Sao Paulo prefers local sustainably certified suppliers. Furthermore, in line with its environmental objectives fresh produce and herbs grown and harvested at the hotel’s green roof garden are used daily by the kitchens. In addition, local Brazilian delicacies such as tapioca, a starch extracted from cassava and widely used in the north region of the country, are also offered at the restaurants for guests to enjoy, adding an in-the-know taste to the guests' experience. \nColleagues actively participate in Corporate Social Responsibility programs such as the social bi-monthly initiative called \"Pedal Voluntario\" where a group of volunteer cyclers collect donations to support local charitable organizations. Also, the IHG´s global initiative, Shelter in a Storm, which actively encourages guests and employees to donate to a fund that may be activated to assist communities hit by natural disasters, has found a great partner at the InterContinental Sao Paulo. The hotel´s contribution to the fund is increasing and Shelter in a Storm has been activated to assist flood victims in Rio Branco, north of Brazil and after the earthquake in Nepal. \nFor further information, please visit icsaopaulo.com . \nAbout Green Globe Certification \nGreen Globe is the worldwide sustainability system based on internationally-accepted criteria for sustainable operation and management of travel and tourism businesses.
