My favorite snack was potato crisps with chocolate bars.\" \nAs for the quail, the chefs explains: \"I like this dish because of the combination of flavours and also because we combine an European product (foie gras) with an Australian product (lemon aspen).\" Reef fish with clams, Jamon air, squid ink & mango.
