From airports to subway and bus operators, Japan has been expanding free Wi-Fi service ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \nUsers on Mount Fuji will need to enter a user ID and password provided in fliers in English, Chinese and Korean that will be distributed at some trailheads. NTT DOCOMO Inc. will provide the service for 72 hours from the initial log-in.
