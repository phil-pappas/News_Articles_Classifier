Whether it's parades, fireworks, history or boy bands you're after, here is a list of our favourite places to celebrate Independence Day. 1. Join the parade: Bristol, Rhode Island Established by a Revolutionary War veteran in 1785, the parade through the coastal town of Bristol, Rhode Island is the oldest Fourth of July celebration in America. Clam chowder, stuffed quahogs (hard-shell clams), local beer and cabinets (that’s milkshakes to you and me) should all feature in Bristol’s festivities, but the main event is the 2.5-mile parade, when the town’s population of 23,000 swells to 100,000. Floats carrying cheerleaders, firemen, and even a Miss Fourth of July, glide down the streets, marching bands rumble by, while locals compete by decorating their clapboard Colonial houses to win prizes. Providence, Rhode Island: New England’s coolest city 2. Celebrate with a bang: Brooklyn, New York Fireworks light up the sky over lower Manhattan Photo: AP Gather with the masses in the glorious park underneath the Brooklyn Bridge , overlooking the harbour, and take in Macy’s Fourth of July fireworks spectacular. You can spend hours visiting the playground, carousel and taking in the art installations here, but don’t forget to reserve a seat on the edge of the East River by 5pm for the 9pm show – there is no better place to watch America’s biggest fireworks display. The annual Fourth of July show features 40,000 fireworks set off to the beat of patriotic music. And if you’re really feeling patriotic, you could spend the afternoon in Coney Island, home to Nathan’s International Hot Dog Eating Contest . 3. History, re-enacted: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Declaration of Independence was adopted here on July 4 (signing didn’t finish until August), so Independence Day in Philadelphia begins with readings from the great document. This year’s celebration of freedom will commemorate a number of milestones: the 50th anniversary of the first major gay and lesbian protest in the United States; the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting; and the 150th anniversary of the addition of the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, which abolished slavery. Visitors can also witness the initiation of new American citizens during a special naturalisation ceremony at the event. You can also see the symbolic tapping of the Liberty Bell, which summoned citizens to hear the first reading of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Later, visit the Benjamin Franklin Parkway for one of the largest free concerts and fireworks at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 4. Meet the presidents: Mount Rushmore, South Dakota Mount-rushmoreMount-rushmore Photo: Getty Don’t expect fireworks at this national park on July 4, but do expect the four presidents represented on the mountainside in attendance. Professional actors posing as Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln will be on hand for questions, pictures and autographs. Visit local towns for: \"Old West shootouts, cook-offs, car shows ‘n shines, great music, picnics, ice cream socials, farmers markets, re-enactors, arts and crafts vendors.\" Yee-haw! 5. New frontiers: Seward, Alaska Perhaps America’s most extreme July 4 event – which started 100 years ago as a bar room bet – the Mount Marathon Race takes place in the tiny port town of Seward in southern Alaska. Relatively short – just over three miles – the race gradient is what hurts here. After a sheer climb of 3,022 feet to a boulder marked by the Stars and Stripes, runners helter-skelter down the slope’s scree, scrub and rocks to the finish on Fourth Avenue. Only one death has been recorded in a century, but there have been countless injuries. As one finisher put it: “If you’re not bleeding in at least one spot, you didn’t try hard enough”. 6. Gourmet Golden Gate: San Francisco, California Ring in the Fourth against the backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge (Photo: Alamy) Photo: ALAMY Lucie Young, author of the Telegraph Travel city guide to San Francisco, suggests visitors try the Fourth of July Waterfront Festival : “The biggest day of celebration in the American calendar is marked with live entertainment, food stalls on the waterfront, and a spectacular fireworks display over San Francisco Bay.” Headliners for the event include WMJ , a trio of 12-year-olds who bill themselves as “the world’s youngest social cause band”; they donate all fees to children’s charities. Rock on! • San Francisco city guide 7. Big stadium bash: Los Angeles, California A hot ticket for July 4 is the Hollywood Bowl concert and fireworks , hosted by Smokey Robinson this year. Earlier in the day, take a 45-minute drive out to Huntingdon Beach and get there before 10am to see the annual all-American parade, with bands and majorettes. • Los Angeles city guide 8. Sci-Fi family fun: Celebration, Florida Every town in the US has its Fourth of July observance, but Simon Venness, co-author of Telegraph Travel's expert guide to Florida, suggests that Disney-town Celebration’s Sci-Fi Fourth of July event is one of the best for families. There’s live music from America’s Got Talent stars, a sci-fi-themed costume contest, bouncy castles, KidZone games and face painting, plenty of shopping and dining and a spectacular fireworks finale. • Florida travel guide 9. Meet me in: St Louis, Missouri The St Louis gateway arch Photo: Â© Image Source / Alamy Celebrate the independence of America under the Gateway Arch, the symbolic monument of east joining west, in Forest Park, on the banks of the Mississippi. Here each year, Fair St Louis , a three-day celebration, happens - with air shows, free concerts and a free firework display. 10. Celebrate freedom in the nation's capital: National Mall and Memorial, Washington, DC Here is where you will see the fireworks , and they promise to be big and loud. You don’t have to be on the Mall to see the celebrations but those who want to be in the hustle and bustle can also expect a concert in celebration of America’s 230th birthday.
