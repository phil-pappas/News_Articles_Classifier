They’re all worthy of your attendance but none offers as broad a musical spectrum as the St. Kitts Music Festival , which features a diverse lineup of RB, jazz, hip-hop, reggae, soca, calypso, and gospel performances over three nights. \n“It’s not only about music, partying, food, drinks and atmosphere; it’s an island-wide phenomenon that energizes our people,” says Lindsay Grant, tourism minister of the tiny twin-island federation (sister island Nevis is just two miles away), which is also the smallest independent nation in the western hemisphere. \nNow in its 19th year, the event draws about 3,000 people a night to the Warner Park Stadium in the capital of Basseterre, a number that’s small by outdoor festival standards but allows everyone plenty of space to spread out over the stadium field. The atmosphere is casual and family-friendly (no obvious drug use or crowd-surfing here), and the festival is likely the region’s most affordable, with tickets starting at just $40 a night or $105 for a season pass to all three. \nHeadliners at this year’s fest (held June 25-27) included RB/pop singers Ciara, Jason Derulo and Trey Songz; soca stars Kerwin Du Bois, Patrice Roberts and Benjai; dancehall deejay Bounty Killer; jazz saxophonist Arturo Tappin; and British reggae band Aswad. For overseas-based Caribbean music lovers, it was an opportunity to see artists who seldom perform Stateside. And where else can you see big-name acts for less than the cost of dinner and a movie? \nBrowse the slideshow above to find out what makes the St Kitts Music Festival the perfect reason to visit a largely undiscovered Caribbean island that, with several new hotel projects on the horizon, won’t remain that way much longer. \nTo take a photo tour of St. Kitts, click through the slideshow below. \nLast Slide Next Slide \nSarah Greaves-Gabbadon is a Caribbean travel expert, award-winning journalist, and TV personality.
