The skies are grey, so she spreads sacking over the soil to protect her investment from the heavy seasonal rains. And a fence made of plastic sheeting keeps her family’s free-range hens from eating the seeds. “They are planted in gravel,” she says, picking at a spindly weed, “because there is better drainage and less of a chance of fungal infection.” The 21-year-old has turned a few square yards of garden into what she hopes will be a coffee nursery, producing plants from which a business will grow. It is a chance to practise new skills. “It is textbook,” says her mentor, Francesco Cortes, who has been responsible for training the students on the project farm , as he admires the planking used to build raised beds for the plants. Yet Luisa makes an unlikely coffee farmer, as she admits. A year ago she knew little about the industry and described herself then as a “daredevil”, keener on parties than trying to find a direction in life. In her teenage years she drank heavily and smoked marijuana because of a turbulent home life in the small town of Subirana in rural Honduras. “I wasn’t sure what to do,” she says. “But now I think about family and business, and I know what my priorities are.” She adds that the past year of classroom lessons and practical work have helped her learn a new set of skills and – just as importantly – put a turbulent childhood behind her. The fact she is working a lot has made her a home person, who comes home at night. She’s too tired to go out partying “Before I didn’t want a family, but now I do,” she says. Her plan involves running a small market garden – including cucumbers, onions and peppers – to sell as she waits for each coffee harvest. Her mother, Celeste, has seen the changes up close. “There are coffee farmers in the family but I did not imagine my daughter would get into the coffee business,” she says. “I have seen her working and she knows her stuff.” Luisa never knew her father. Her mother still supports the family by buying boxes of clothes, perfume or stainless-steel cooking utensils and selling them for a small profit. But it has been a struggle. Celeste suffers from diabetes and is wheelchair-bound after having had her right leg amputated. And she says she blames herself for her daughter’s troubles, which began with an abusive stepfather, who has long since been banished. Yet mother and daughter share a broad grin and a readiness to giggle. Sitting in the neat front room of her home adorned with family photos and cuddly toys, where Celeste stacks her boxes of wares ready for sale, she explains her pride in her daughter. “She has had to overcome so many things emotionally,” she says, as a motorbike putt-putts past the open door. “The fact she is working a lot has made her a home person, who comes home at night.” And then with a sly look at her embarrassed daughter, she laughs broadly and adds: “She’s too tired to go out partying.” • To discover more about the Coffee vs Gangs project and read about gang culture in Honduras, visit telegraph.co.uk/coffeevsgangs You may also be interested in: • Video: Visiting the Coffee vs Gangs farm • The Honduras coffee region by numbers • Coffee production: from seedling to coffee cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:37:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
