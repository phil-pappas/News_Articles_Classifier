Successful events will also be able to leverage the branding of the FestivalsNT campaign by using the associated logo.\n“In 2015, events funded under the program included Lasseters Easter in the Alice Mountain Bike Muster, Barunga Festival, Summer Session Music Festival, Mindil Beach Sunset Markets, the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair and the Alice Springs Beanie Festival.”\nTourism NT’s $100,000 Event Marketing Sponsorship Program supports the Government’s FestivalsNT initiative which positions the Territory as home to some of Australia’s best festivals and events.\nUnder the program, smaller grants of up to $5,000 are also available to help with marketing for new and developing events such as regional community events, grants of up to $10,000 for marketing of annual established events and grants of up to $20,000 for innovative marketing of major events.\n“The Event Marketing Sponsorship Program is part of the Government’s plan to drive the development of North Australia and build a $2.2 billion visitor economy by 2020,” Mr Giles said.\nApplications for events to be held in 2016 are now open until 31 August 2015.\nRelated Posts BASSINTHEGRASS Music Festival kicks off tomorrow in Darwin Giles Government to renovate Milingimbi Art and Culture Aboriginal Corporation Barunga Festival invites visitors to celebrate 30 years of art and music FestivalsNT creates $1.7 million new position to see proper celebration of Territory Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:32:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
