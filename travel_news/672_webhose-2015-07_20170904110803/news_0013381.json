These double-daily services provide more convenient options for guests travelling between the UAE and Seychelles, and to key destinations across the Gulf region, Middle East, Europe, North America, Indian Subcontinent, North Asia, and Australia. \n\n\nPassengers from European destinations such as Berlin, Frankfurt, London, and Paris will now benefit from two daily options to travel to Seychelles via Etihad Airways’ hub in Abu Dhabi. \n\n\nKevin Knight, Etihad Airways’ Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The change in Etihad Airways’ flight schedule means that our guests now have the choice and flexibility of a consistent double-daily service between Abu Dhabi and Seychelles and better onward flight connections across our global network.” \n\n\nEtihad Airways commenced services between Abu Dhabi and Mahé in the Seychelles in November 2011, while Air Seychelles began operations in March 2012. The airlines now operate two-class Airbus A320 (16 Business Class and 120 Economy Class) aircraft offering more than 3,800 seats on the route each week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:02:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
