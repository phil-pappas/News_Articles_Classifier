For example, the salt and charcoal baked chicken is marinated for 24 hours in wild mushrooms and truffle, then baked until the dough becomes hard. It is then cracked open at the table with a hammer for the guests. The signature breakfast will be the salmon and truffle scrambled eggs served with shaved truffles and salmon caviar. Seafood lovers have much to look forward to. Indian Ocean dishes include Maldivian lobster, steamed grouper, baked jobfish and oysters (with a choice of coriander chutney or vodka granita) and Peruvian ceviche (local job fish served with freshly made coconut cream, island-grown lime, and Konotta garden herbs). \"Our dishes and cocktails celebrate Indian Ocean, regional and international influences,\" says Archdeacon. \"Whatever is available locally is featured on our menus â€“ for example, freshly caught line reef fish, yellowfin tuna and lobster. Regional spices, herbs and flavours such as passion fruit, lemongrass and coconut are also recurring themes in our preparation.\" Iconic international favourites made with flair also feature. Guests can opt for Tasmanian salmon, Australian Black Angus beef fillet, achari lamb, and Sri Lankan jumbo prawns, among others. The Outrigger Konotta Maldives Resort has four innovative outlets: Blue Salt for international and regional dining; Poolside dining overlooking the ocean; the Nala Rah teppan and sushi bar (\"exquisite fusion and interactive dining with stunning ocean and island views,\" says Archdeacon); and in-villa dining with the option of a personal chef and butler.
