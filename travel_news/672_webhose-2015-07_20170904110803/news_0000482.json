Her experience running a small charity at a time of significant cuts to government funding led her to seek a role helping other local organisations in a similar position. She will continue involvement with Satro, and her role as Trustee of two other charities (Surrey Youth Focus and EDT).\nHer role with Heathrow Community Fund will be to grow the impact, profile and income for the charity, to bring greater benefits to local community organisations and voluntary groups.\nThe charity’s current Director Caroline Nicholls is moving on after 12 years to work within the voluntary sector, closer to her home on the West Sussex coast.\nCommenting on the opportunities ahead, Dr Bowden said:\n“These are challenging times for voluntary organisations and social enterprises and Heathrow Community Fund is uniquely placed to fund high-impact projects in an area of huge contrasts and great need.\n“I also believe that the Fund could make a great difference to the local voluntary organisations by helping them to further develop the business acumen and networks that they will need, not only to survive but also to meet the new challenges in society that will emerge in the next few years.\n“Thanks to the continued support and funding from Heathrow, the community fund has already made a considerable positive impact through grants to hundreds of local groups, schools and voluntary organisations since it was first set up nearly 20 years ago – I look forward to helping the charity develop further in the future.”\nHeathrow Community Fund Chairman Steve Ronald, who is also Head of Product for British Airways, said:\n“Beccy will be a great asset to our work – she has a strong track record working at a senior level with the youth sector in Surrey and excellent local networks in both the voluntary and business sector; we look forward to working with her to take Heathrow Community Fund to new heights.\n“I would also like to thank Caroline for the skill and commitment she has brought to developing the fund over the years – it has been able to benefit many community projects as a result.”\nThe Heathrow Community Funds awards is an independent charity set up in 1996 by Heathrow Airport and awards more than £600,000 a year to local charities and community programmes. Its main sources of income include an annual donation from Heathrow Airport Ltd as well as fines imposed on aircraft which breach noise limits.\nRelated Posts Airlines rated on noise performance – Heathrow Airport Heathrow receives highest recognition for leaving a lighter carbon footprint Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America April 1 Alert: WestJet moves to metric time Antalya ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T21:01:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
