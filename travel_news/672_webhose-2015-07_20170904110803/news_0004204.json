Eight years after his last major triumph, at the 2007 Masters, the 39-year-old American finished this marathon 144th Open Championship as the last man standing in a three-man play-off. • Johnson holds nerve against Leishman and Oosthuizen to win Claret Jug “I feel blessed to be the champion,” Johnson said of his victory. “I feel honoured to be part of the history of this game and to don my name on that trophy.” Starting the day three shots off the lead, Johnson turned to scripture, specifically Psalms 27:14, to guide him around the course: “Be patient, wait for the Lord. Be courageous and brave. Yes, be patient, wait for the Lord.” Johnson was in equal parts patient and brave. He attacked when the moment was right but was also able to extract himself from trouble, notably on the third hole of the play-off at the 17th. “The key, certainly, for the week is patience and perseverance, without question, and I think in the play-off in particular it was truly about just making the best of opportunities, because you know the other two guys are not going to let it slide, specifically Louis; he played tremendous,” he said. Johnson also has a nice line in self-deprecation. He is aware that he is no poster boy, referencing his bald spot in his press conference, and that, aside from the sizeable American contingent, the majority of support lay elsewhere. The Australian Marc Leishman had the sympathy vote after his wife, Audrey, almost died earlier this year from a rare bacterial infection, South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen had the history of winning here in 2010, and Texan Jordan Spieth, of course, was gunning for history. Hence, Johnson had to be content with a place on the rails. He finished the first round with a 66 – one shot away from Dustin Johnson, the pacesetter, but still described himself as being “under the radar”. Solid but unspectacular rounds of 71 and 70 – the latter after no birdies in his opening 13 holes – left him drifting further into the pack, before the American timed his charge to perfection. “I guess that radar is going ­bonkers right now,” Johnson said. “I don’t mind being in that position. When my game is good, certainly I surface on the radar. I don’t know if it’s ever really beeping on me.” His game was more than good in that final round. After catapulting himself up the leaderboard with five birdies on the front nine, Johnson continued his momentum after the turn with further birdies at 10 and 12, the latter after a sumptuous chip, before bogeying the 13th and 17th holes. At 14 under, Johnson knew that a birdie was essential at the last hole, and he duly delivered with a 20‑foot putt that his caddie, Damon Green, celebrated with a unique dance. “The emotion was there briefly, ­because I knew mentally I had to get my emotions in check because I had to get ready for obviously what happened.” Then all that was left to do was hope – and that hope was duly realised when Leishman dropped a shot at 16 and neither Oosthuizen nor Spieth could overhaul Johnson’s total of 273. By closing out the play‑off, Johnson becomes part of a ­select band to own both a Green Jacket and a Claret Jug, a prospect that he would have found fantastical 15 years ago. “I would have said, whose am I trying on, and whose am I touching? I’m humbled right now because of what’s in my lap and the names that are etched on this piece of metal that is very special. It’s the who’s who in the game. It’s the guys that paved the way.” Despite completing potentially the world’s longest chain of high‑fives down The Links, Johnson was not sticking around the Old Town to celebrate, instead getting the first plane back to the United States to be with his family. “This isn’t going to define me or my career, at least I hope it doesn’t. It’s not my legacy. Granted, as a professional athlete and as a golfer I’m going to relish this, I’m going to savour this, I’m humbled by this. But my legacy should be my kids, my family.” Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T11:18:58.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
