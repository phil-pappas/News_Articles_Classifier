IFA is a centre for innovation, providing a link between research, young entrepreneurs with new startups, industry and trade, for a vibrant exchange of knowledge, information and fresh business ideas. This year’s TecWatch programme features 55 exhibitors and partners from 15 countries, including the USA, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Japan and Israel. There are also some 50 startups, whose exhibits are grouped together on a number of different theme days.\nFive fascinating theme days devoted to startups\nIn 2014 technically minded visitors to IFA, along with journalists, experts and decision-makers from trade and industry, took a keen interest in the displays staged by the founders of a number of new business ventures. The Startup Day, organised jointly by TecWatch and the German Startup Federation, is an ideal opportunity for these new companies to present papers, pitches and panel discussions as a means of introducing their technical visions and business models. IFA 2015 offers an even bigger stage for TecWatch and the German Startup Federation to continue their collaboration, with even more startup exhibits and a variety of key subjects spread over several days at the trade show.\nSmartHome and the Internet of Things\nNumerous small and medium sized companies are presenting their solutions for the interconnected home, where the Internet of Things is exerting a growing influence on our everyday lives. International organisations and alliances are also making their own contributions to this topic, and among them are Z-Wave and the Allseen Alliance.\nOne particularly fascinating aspect is the increasing number of ideas that are intended to make complex technology more user-friendly, overcoming compatibility problems and linking isolated applications.\nThe next generation of digital media\nThe web and broadcasting meet on screen, merging seamlessly thanks to technologies based on the HbbTV standard. IFA TecWatch is presenting the next generation for the first time, in the form of HbbTV 2.0, with exciting innovations that also involve tablet displays as a second screen. Another topic of particular relevance to the future of broadcasting is DVB-T2, the latest generation of terrestrial television, which is being introduced in Germany for the first time with highly efficient HEVC video coding and has been developed for Ultra HD. IFA TecWatch is showing what can be achieved with this new transmission technology. TecWatch is also demonstrating groundbreaking solutions in the field of sound, for example with new codecs, providing interactive selection and individual mixing of various audio tracks. And the Future of Ultra HD introduces spectacular technologies for HDR (High Dynamic Range) and extended colour spaces. A number of special demonstrations are equally interesting, showing how Ultra-HD sequences can be transferred from a large screen to a tablet\n3D printing and wearables\nIn addition to printer hardware, exhibitors are also presenting software for 3D printing, services and solutions for creating templates as well as scanners for analyzing objects. These also include a man-sized installation capable of carrying out a complete 3D body scan in fractions of a second. One of the most interesting wearables is a running shoe with a built-in sensor, which registers every single step and supplies all the information required for a digital training programme.\nResearch and system development\nUniversities and research institutes regularly feature in TecWatch. Among them this year is Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, represented by three of its institutes, Heinrich Hertz and Fokus from Berlin, as well as the Fraunhofer IIS Institute, Erlangen. All three are presenting some fascinating and innovative examples of media technology. Colleges and universities based in Berlin and Brandenburg are presenting projects covering all aspects of digital living, together with spin-offs, startups and other partners. The University of Kyoto is represented by research projects dealing with information and media technology.\nEducation in the digital world\nA joint presentation by the industry associations VDE, ZVEH and ZVEI focuses on promoting innovation, under the slogan ‘Fit for the digital world’. These three organisations are providing details about education and training in the digital world in an effort to interest more young people in technical careers, thereby attracting the young people who will introduce the innovations of the future and launch new businesses.\nWork stations are being set up to provide a hands-on experience. A mini e-house has been created by trainees to show how young people are developing a greater affinity for this subject. And there is also a Girls’ Day, which is intended to encourage girls and young women to take up technical careers.\nExhibitors at IFA TecWatch\n3D Sound Labs, Allseen Alliance, alphaEOS, Beuth Hochschule Berlin, Bird Home Automation, botspot, Brewie, Brinno, Bundesverband Deutsche Startups, Chipolo, Deutsche TV-Plattform, Digitalstrom, E2C, exelonix, Eliq, Evrythng, Formlabs, Fraunhofer Institute Fokus, Fraunhofer Institute Heinrich Hertz, Fraunhofer Institute IIS, Gla Gla International, Green Pocket, Hardware Club, Homido, Kibbi, Media Broadcast, HDMI Licensing, Matrix 3D Solutions, HZO, igo3D, Info Tip, IMEC, ninvoxia, NodOn, Mota, Panono, Parce, Projektron, SoS Ventures, Spin Digital, SPIN remote, Tado, TU Berlin Science Marketing, Technische Universität Berlin, The Connected Lightning Alliance, University of Kyoto, University of Potsdam, Vbox, VDE, Vkansee, Worldline, yetu AG, ZVEH, ZVEI, Z-Wave.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor Israel arrives on start-up scene Queensland tourism operators to learn the latest trends of digital marketing eRevMax offers hoteliers access to advanced rate recommendations within the LIVE platform", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T21:06:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
