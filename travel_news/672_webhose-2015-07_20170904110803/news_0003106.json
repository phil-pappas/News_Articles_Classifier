Many Australians are stuck in Bali after spending the school break on the island. \nVirgin Australia also cancelled its flights to and from Bali Monday, saying their forecasters had warned that conditions were not suitable, while Jetstar resumed services during daylight hours. \nAirport manager Trikora Harjo said the airport was operating normally again, adding: \"The weather is good so I am not sure why one or two airlines have chosen not to fly.\" \nThe disruption also came at a bad time for Indonesians, as millions set off on holiday ahead of the Muslim celebration of Eid this week. The airport is providing buses for Indonesians seeking to leave Bali for the holy festival. \nAuthorities raised the alert status of Mount Raung, one of 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia, late last month to the second highest level, after it began to spew lava and ash high into the air. \nThe main concern for airlines regarding volcanic ash is not that it can affect visibility but rather that it could damage jet engines, according to experts. \nAsh turns into molten glass when it is sucked into aircraft engines and in extreme cases can cause them to shut down. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
