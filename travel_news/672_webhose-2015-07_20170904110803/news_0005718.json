Carefully contrasting its environment, this member of Design Hotels™’ modern cut stone façade houses 21 rooms and apartments, each with their own private terrace to take in the restorative air and panoramic vistas. Although it is one of the few areas in Lake Como to boast a beach, Lezzeno remains a largely undiscovered region, allowing for an authentic and quintessential Italian experience. \nAuthenticity and provenance are also central to the family-owned hotel’s philosophy, and a close relationship with the local community allows guests to experience the ‘real’ Lombardy: from moonlit fishing trips to private vineyard tours. Throw in an infinity pool that stretches deep into the glimmering blue of the wishbone-shaped lake to seal the deal When Original and Lake Como native Alessandro Sironi returned home with his family from a long stint in Miami, he rediscovered the uniqueness of this incredible area and strengthened his belief in protecting and preserving its heritage. The building, once the site of a small wire factory, took five years to build due to restrictions that protect the landscape and history of the region. “I love being surrounded by the changing seasons, by towns and buildings that are centuries old, and by the mix of traditional and contemporary art and culture that permeates the elements of everyday life,” he says. Joining up with the outstanding development company Nessi & Majocchi, Sironi created a space where modern luxury rooted in the area’s rich history reigns. Local stones typical of the Lombardy region ensure that the façade integrates nicely into the mountainside. With limited space available, fewer and larger rooms were chosen, offering stunning views of Bellagio, Villa Balbianello, and Comacina Island. Well-known Italian designer Alessandro Agrati lent his magic to Filario’s décor, implementing his signature style of “dressing” interiors with textiles and light and strong-tempered objects. The spacious guestrooms and apartments here offer a cocoon-like feel heightened by subtle elegance. Raw, natural fabrics were locally-sourced for the linen curtains and accessories, and Frette bed linen ensures a sublimely comfortable night’s sleep. Italian heritage and artisanship are a focal point at the hotel, which has been furnished with custom-made pieces by local craftsmen in the neighboring town of Cantù, a hub for high-end Italian design. ￼ Alessandro Sironi has curated a collection of authentic, local experiences, offering guests a meaningful insight into his neighborhood: from midnight fishing trips with local skippers to tours of the surrounding world-class vineyards and visits to artisan cheese makers. Post adventure, guests can lounge by the infinity pool or on the hotel’s private beach taking in the panoramic views of the lake, which have provided inspiration for artists and poets for centuries. A gym featuring Technogym equipment (with personal trainers available upon request) awaits the fitness freaks among us, while in-room massages and bespoke REALL beauty treatments are tailored to any relaxation or regimen. For the gourmet, the Bistrò showcases the best the region has to offer with classic Italian dishes and wine. Filario’s ethos resides in the holistic: exceptional in-suite relaxation, fine honest food, unobtrusive service and an immersion in the surrounding nature. Thanks to its idyllic location, Lezzeno offers plenty of water activities along with history. Apart from waterskiing and wakeboarding, guests can also hire speedboats from the neighboring shipyards or make use of the traditional wooden water taxis to visit Bellagio. The region’s beautiful medieval villages enchant with their picturesque cobbled lanes, magnificent villas, and quaint shops featuring enticing local wares. The unique atmosphere and culture of Lezzeno offers guests a refreshingly authentic alternative to Lake Como’s more established regions.
