Those planning to drive their own cars into Ladakh should exercise extreme caution. To be clear, taking out of state taxis in Ladakh is banned anyways, but this happened against a convoy of private cars driven by citizens. # 3 There is also a sort of \"circular\" doing rounds which claims to have some sort of \"authority\" behind it . It talks of banning driving private vehicles in Ladakh and one has to park the private cars in Leh and take local taxies for sightseeing blah blah blah. The law of the land has perhaps gone for a toss. It seems to be some sort of \"resolution\" of taxi unions etc and has no legal leg to stand Attached Images # 4 Wow! That's just plain unconstitutional - against article 19. Seems to have the sanction of few associations that have nothing to do with travel. It's not very readable but seems to be sanctioned by the Ladakh buddhist association??. Do you have a larger copy of this? Well, there're plenty of other states to explore. # 5 Sorry no better copy till now. Unfortunately the whole state is under the grip of one mafia or another. You go to Sonamarg , they will compel you to hire their \"local\" vehicles for a 15 minute trip at exorbitant rates. Now Ladakh. Going down the drain. Cheers In the land of awesomeness Posts: # 7 Re: We traveled in our own brand new Fortuner with a convoy of 15 vehicles which also had two self-drive rental vehicles. Unaware of the goings on and the extent to which these taxi union people could go to, all 15 vehicles did the local sightseeing circuit. On our way back from Pangong Lake, the two self-drive vehicles were stopped. Their windows were smashed, a huge stone was smashed  Wild stuff .. how did the taxi union boys identify the self-drive rental vehicles ?

The commercial vehicles have yellow number plates AFAIK regards # 9 According to this report Two Cars in the Convoy were being driven by two lady drivers & their cars were also attacked with Iron Rods . # Gadeshwar Dam is a local picnic place near Panvel. To reach there one has to get down at Panvel railway station or bus station and then hire a 6 seater rickshaw to get there. There is line of 6 seaters opposite the bus station on the way to Mumbai from where one has to avail them. We were there 9 years ago and were told that the charges would be Rs 300/- inclusive of the waiting time. We felt that it was a bit to high. Then we approached another rickshaw driver on the opposite end of the road who agreed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:44:05.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
