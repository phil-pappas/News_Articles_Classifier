Wine selections are available in a 2 oz. taste, a 6 oz. glass, or by the bottle. Sheraton hotel associates will better understand the best-in-class vintages featured on the Sheraton Selects menu as they complete Treasury Wine Estates' Wine Training & Education modules. The Paired program, offered across Sheraton properties globally, is available daily during the lobby venue's hours of operation. Example menu items include: Seared Sesame Salmon with Asian slaw , paired with a Pinot Noir or a Pale Ale Goat Cheese Brulee with Fig Jam and Cranberry Focaccia , paired with Merlot or Brown Ale Marinated Roasted Olives with Grilled Lemon and Red Chili , paired with Shiraz or Bourbon Barrel-aged ale Cantonese Style Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings , paired with Riesling or IPA Through its expanded lobby bar menu, Sheraton enables guests to experience more of their destinations' various cuisines by often featuring global cuisine with local influences, while also challenging them to expand their palates. As part of the program, participating Sheraton properties will bring Paired to life with engaging programming—ranging from educational demonstrations by local craft breweries or sommelier hosted courses where guests learn the art behind flavor pairing. \"The Paired menu concept delights the palate and invites exploration,\" said Achim Lenders, Vice President, Starwood Global Food and Beverage. \"Knowing the right beverages can enhance any food, our team carefully handpicked premium wines and craft beers to complement each unique small plate and accentuate its rich flavors.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:21:12.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
