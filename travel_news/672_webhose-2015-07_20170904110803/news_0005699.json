Source: Twitter\nThe “captain’s call” to stop government ministers appearing on the political panel show came after the ABC gave a platform to Sydney man Zaky Mallah who was convicted of threatening to kill two ASIO officers and charged with terror offences.\nMr Abbott instructed ministers not to appear on the show after an inquiry was announced, with Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce the first to cancel his appearance.\nWhen asked earlier this week whether he would appear on next Monday’s panel, Turnbull cryptically said: “time will tell — stay tuned.”\nTony Abbott has banned government ministers from the panel.

Pic: Kym Smith Source: News Corp Australia\nWhile we haven’t been able to confirm with Mr Turnbull’s office whether the minister will in fact don his leather jacket and join the panel, it seems he hasn’t cancelled his appearance. Still there is no guaranteed he won’t.\nWhen asked earlier this week whether he would defy the Prime Minister’s orders and do the show, Mr Turnbull said it would “depend on the circumstances” on the day.\nOriginally published as Turnbull to defy PM’s Q&A ban?", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/malcolm-turnbull-to-ignore-q-a-ban-and-appear-on-panel-abc/story-e6frfmyi-1227435096363", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/096335-fe6456fa-25d5-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/095765-b1c55d8a-25d5-11e5-b2b1-af71b9aa897c.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227435/095793-d5db9398-22a5-11e5-97e3-7b9718e2dd0f.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T06:24:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
