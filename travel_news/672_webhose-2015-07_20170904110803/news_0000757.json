So when Port's Jay Schulz escaped sanction for what appeared to be a similar tackle against Sydney on Thursday night, he tweeted this:\nI'm confused...\n— Bryce Gibbs (@BGibbsy4) July 6, 2015 As always, Gibbs received plenty of replies, but the most visible was from an actual Power player, as Sam Colquhoun defended his teammate.\n@BGibbsy4 two actions pal\n— Sam Colquhoun (@SamColquhoun) July 6, 2015 It didn’t stop there though, with Zach Tuohy jumping in to side with Gibbs.\n@SamColquhoun @BGibbsy4 kidding yourself \"pal\"!!!\n— Zach Tuohy (@zach2e) July 6, 2015\nAnd so Carlton v Port Adelaide was declared the greatest footy rivalry in all of social media. By us, right now.\nUPDATE: The war continues!\nTwo days after Colquhoun’s jibe, Gibbs found the perfect material to get back at him.\nThe Blue tweeted this out after Port Adelaide dropped Colquhoun for this week’s game.\n@SamColquhoun unlucky...

Source: Supplied\nThey’ve also invited Crows fans to join in their usually parochial discussions.\nIt’s another kind act from the AFL community, which has shown how truly great it can be over this incredibly tough time.\nRETURN OF THE LITTLE MASTER\nIF his dad was God, we guess that means that His son has risen. Or perhaps his Sun.\nApologies for the awful puns, but we’ve missed discussing Gary Ablett. Nat Fyfe’s incredible season has seen him overtake Ablett in the eyes of many for the title of best current player but Ablett reminded us how good he can be this weekend, as he inspired Gold Coast to just their second win of the season, an upset over North Melbourne.\nAnd didn’t Twitter love it!\nThe legend himself @GaryAblettJnr . #AFLSunsNorth pic.twitter.com/yJkVOzYb6N\n— Yvonne W (@yvonne_w93) July 4, 2015\n31 possessions, 11 clearances, 7 inside 50s & 3 goals.
