And it potentially means the death of thousands of otherwise rich and lively conversations about anything else it doesn't even matter what OMG. \nYou need to know how to defend yourself against a Shark Week fan, so pay attention, it could save your life. \nAvoid eye contact! Shark Week fans take eye contact as a sign of interest. \nDon't thrash around! If you see a Shark Week fan, don't move -- THEY SENSE MOVEMENT WITH THEIR EYES. If they see you moving, they'll identify you as another human being who they can discuss Shark Week with. \nIf you're spotted, get in a defensive position! \nResist the urge to stab or impale them! Because then you'll go to prison. And not just for a week. You'll be experiencing Shark Life. \nIf you must attack them, go for the gills! Note: Assume most die-hard Shark Week fans have had cosmetic surgery to get gills. They're super proud of these, so if you strike them here, they will probably leave you alone. \nFool someone into entering the conversation, so you can escape! That might not seem nice, but you what? THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ISN'T NICE. \nVoid your bowels! This is a final option, but they will go away.
