The mercury may even flirt with the triple digits around the peak heat of the middle of the week. \nTemperatures are likely to fall short of breaking long-standing records, but the stifling heat can still be dangerous. \nEvery year there are more heat-related fatalities in the United States than there are during frigid arctic outbreaks, according to the National Weather Service. \nSome of these occur when people leave their children unattended in a car during the oppressive heat. Even with windows cracked, temperatures can soar to dangerous levels in a matter of minutes. \nStaying hydrated and wearing sunblock is also important when it comes to protecting yourself from the dangers that a heat wave brings. \n\"If people have to be outdoors during the peak heating hours each day, they should take breaks in the shade or indoors if they are able to do so,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Danny Pydynowski. \nThe intense heat should begin to fade heading into the upcoming weekend with highs in the 80s rather than the 90s. \nThese temperatures are right around normal for the end of July. \nThis cool down should give residents in the Northeast a break from the heat and humidity heading into the opening days of August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:56:17.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
