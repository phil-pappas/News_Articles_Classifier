The French capital is at it again on July 4 and will even have a hunt dedicated specifically to English speakers. \nRegistration for the next treasure hunt in Paris is open on tresorsdeparis.fr. For this tenth edition, investigators for the day will have to solve an enigma based on a mysterious theme entitled “Le conseil des 4” (The Coucil of 4). \nEchoing the colossal revamp of Les Halles, the former food market in the center of Paris, the intrigue will imagine the discovery of four century-old houses spread across the city of love. These houses protect the treasures of Paris. Participants will have to answer all the necessary questions in order to decide which of them will have a seat at the “Council of 4” and become the new guardian of the treasures. \nFifteen arrondissements (districts) in Paris will unite for this enormous treasure hunt (3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th), as will the suburban cities of Saint-Ouen and Saint-Denis. In all, 52 hunts will be offered, including one specifically for anglophones and one for people with reduced mobility. Participants will have the choice of five departure points: Place Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Pigalle, Place d’Italie, Place des Vosges and Place Stalingrad. \nParticipants can hunt for treasure alone or in teams. After free registration, they can download their game booklet from the event’s official website. — Afp-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T07:16:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
