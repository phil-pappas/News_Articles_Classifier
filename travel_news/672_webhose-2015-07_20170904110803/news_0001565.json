This year some 150,000 people are expected at the fair at Harewood House, near Leeds. • 10 best country house hotels in England And to show just how far the event has come, it’s reinventing the term “park and ride”. Instead of dumping your car in a car park and hopping on a bus, here you jump on a helicopter, for just £156 . Woof! It's a canine heaven (Handout) And if you’ve got a small dog with you, it can fly for free. It’s all part of an attempt to draw more families to the event (adults pay £30 a day to get into the fair, but children under 17 are free). What’s more, although the show doesn’t officially start until Friday July 31, the camp site opens on Wednesday July 29, making the event into a bit of a mini-break. It’s a bit like an agricultural Glastonbury. And the organisers are promising that there will be plenty to interest people of all ages, especially those at the younger end. Visitors at all ages can have fun at the fair (CLA) “We are making a big effort to attract a younger generation of kids, who might otherwise be sitting in front of their computers,” says fair spokesman Charlie Thomas. “Grown-up countryside-lovers will turn up in wellies, whatever the weather. But because young people these days don’t have as much access to the countryside, they are a bit nervous about venturing out there.” • This is what it's really like to move to the country As a result, as well as offering activities for all the farmers and other serious-minded rural folk, the organisers are also making a big effort to attract younger participants, so that instead of having to stifle a yawn as they watch their parents admire farm machinery, the young showgoers take part in a range of activities. Archery is on the menu at the CLA Game Fair (CLA) Not only can they try their hand at shooting, but they can also drive a JCB digger or have a go at off-road driving. There will also be the chance to try archery, climbing and kayaking. The fun doesn’t have to stop once night falls. Just as at Glastonbury there is a campsite, where families of four can stay for £125 for three nights in their own tent, or hire up-market versions on site. Yes, the days of having to rough it are long gone. You don’t even have to make your own sandwiches beforehand for a picnic, instead you can order a hamper (£50 or £75) for collection from the Champers and Hampers stand. Working dogs sit their exams at the Game Fair (Stephen Lock) That doesn’t mean, of course, that farming and agriculture disappear in a cloud of fizzy bubbles. There are 900 firms exhibiting at the fair, promoting mowers, tractors, shotguns and cattle feed. And there will be resident advisers in the Kennel Club Dog Zone, too, who are there to help you choose the right four-pawed companion. • Our love affair with grand country houses It’s anticipated that the Game Fair will bring together the largest gundog collection ever seen in Britain. Plus, there will be a constant round of shows in the main arena, exhibiting the best Britain has to offer when it comes to birds of prey, working farm dogs, and what is for many the highlight of the event, the Shetland Pony Grand National. The Game Fair is fun all everyone (CLA) On top of which, there is a vast Great British Village area where, having seen how the farmers go about the growing and production process, people can taste some of their wares. There’s no doubt that the list of things to do is a lot longer than it was in 1958. Look down the exhibitors at Harewood House, and there’s more than just potatoes and pork coming out of British fields. • The Duke of Rutland and his CLA Game Fair “The event has changed so much since it first began,” says Thomas. “Back in 1958, it was a real gathering of rural professionals: estate manager, landowners, accountants. The big difference today is that we provide something for everyone. We’ve realised that although not everyone still lives in a rural area, there still exists within Britain a great pride in our countryside.” You're spoilt for choice at the Game Fair (Jake Eastham) Buy a ticket For Friday (£30), Saturday (£25), Friday and Saturday or Sunday (£50), all three days (£75).
