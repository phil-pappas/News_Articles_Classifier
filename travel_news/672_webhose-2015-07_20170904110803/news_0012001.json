Sign In Here If you need access to the African bush, Japanese sword fighting lessons or World War II relics in Europe, call David Marek . The CEO and president of Katy-based safari operator Ker & Downey has been in the luxury travel business for more than 40 years. When he graduated from Texas A&M University in 1978, he took a job with Gulf States Toyota; by chance, his boss owned a safari travel company that was located in Botswana at the time. They got to talking, and he got to thinking. “I graduated in May; by November, I found myself in Botswana finalizing the purchase of a company called Ker Downey & Selby,” Marek said. “I fell in love with it after that.” After restructuring, a subsequent name change and going “whole hog” outside of Africa, Ker & Downey has become the No. 1 safari operator on the planet, according to Travel + Leisure’s 2015 World’s Best Awards list. To date, Ker & Downey has done business in over 80 countries and worked with a litany of celebrities, including Houston’s Beyonce Knowles . Marek has planned every kind of getaway under the sun, from honeymoons to helping a World War II veteran meet the last surviving European soldier from a battle he once fought in. What’s your most popular travel package? Africa is still our big seller. Sixty percent of what we sell is Africa. The country in Africa we sell the most is South Africa because it’s easy and first world. That blows people away who have never been there. Do you find a lot of people doubt Africa as a luxury destination? A lot of people have this perception of Africa, but the road system is great, everything works, the food is wonderful, and some of the best hotels in the world are in African bush. South Africa has developed this luxury model that’s better than anything else in the world. And now, that model is being exported in Botswana and east Africa. There’s a huge growth of luxury properties over there. What other countries are on the up and up in luxury travel? Unless an event knocks a country back — this past year, Africa was knocked back because of the Ebola virus — there’s more properties in Africa that offer out-of-this-world luxury travel. South America is making strides there, and they’re coming onto luxury travel. There are more and more opportunities for people that want to travel in a certain style. How did Ebola impact business in Africa? Well, if we had clients who were concerned, we’d refund their money. But if we could still work with them, we’d transfer them to other destinations. The Ebola virus didn’t impact any of our destinations in Africa. Americans think of Africa as one place, but it’s basically three times the size of the U.S. What factors outside your control affect business? We can easily work around natural disasters. A couple years ago, when Egypt was having its turmoil, we could fly people out of there on a private plane if we needed to. It’s a comfort level our clients have in knowing that if something’s going to happen, we’re going to get them out of there. What does your clientele look like? Generally, they’re people who have other people managing their money. We’ve worked with Larry Fitzgerald from the Arizona Cardinals, around half a dozen players in the NFL, actors, singers, and celebrities like Reba McEntire, Beyoncé, and others. We also take schoolteachers and other people who save for their vacation. It runs a full gamet. We do a lot of honeymoons, but it’s not a big percentage of what we do. We’re getting more families and a lot of cross-generational travel. Did you travel a lot as a kid? No, I kind of just fell into this. I’m a nervous traveler. When I go to another country, I get the experience of going through airports and stuff, and if I get nervous about it, I want to make sure that our clients don’t get nervous about it. I want to make it as easy as possible for them. The first face you’ll see when you get off your airplane is a person from Ker & Downey waiting for you, and you’ll be the only person on that flight with a luxury reception. It costs a little more, but it gives that feeling of comfort for somebody that was nervous, but now knows there’s someone there who will take them everywhere. What new initiatives are you working on this year? This year, we just started selling U.S. trips to international clients. So, there was a need for that, because if you think about it, a foreign person that’s coming to the U.S. wants to cram as much as possible into 10 days or two weeks, and it’s a big issue for them to coordinate all of that. That’s new for us — it just started within the last 30 days, and we’ve already had a few clients. Tell me about the process between a client walking in your door to getting on the plane. If somebody walked through the door on a Thursday and said they wanted to go on their trip on Monday, we could make it happen. As long as we could get the air connections, we could do it. That happens. It’s amazing — the turnaround time and response time for Africa is outstanding, and that’s because we demand it. It’s hard working with countries in different continents, but the workers in Africa are amazing, because they know if they want our clients, they have to respond fast. Some workers in Africa have 24-hour availability for us, so anytime of the day or night, we can give them a call. Not all countries and continents do that. How has your business changed over the years? I think the time people expect to book safaris has changed. People used to book well in advance — even up to a year in advance — but now we’re getting more and more people saying that they want to travel next month. So it challenges us a little bit, because we do a lot of documentation and other things that takes time. Tell me about your philanthropic work with Ker & Downey. It’s very important. One of my messages for people that want to start a business, or are already in business, is to give back. When I travel to these really poor countries, it strikes me how well we have it here. The gap between the richer and poorer countries is just getting bigger and bigger. So, this company is going to support those countries. In Uganda, there are still huge malaria issues. 100,000 people still die of malaria each year in Uganda, and most of those people are children under the age of five. Through Church of the Holy Apostles in Katy, we started doing trips to Uganda, and we’d take anywhere from 6,000 to 12,000 mosquito nets. At $7 per net, that’s not exactly cheap, and Ker & Downey supported it heavily. When we’re over there in Uganda, we hire local doctors instead of bringing American doctors because local doctors understand the issues these people deal with. We offer medications to people in Africa year-round, and not just when we’re there volunteering. We’re just trying to help that population. You can’t help them all, but you can certainly help a few.
