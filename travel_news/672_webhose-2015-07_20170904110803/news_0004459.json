We’re already welcoming delegates from around 20 European countries, and it’s our hope that every city in Europe will be represented at the conference”.\nCommenting on the move of AngularConnect, James Rees, Executive Director, ExCeL London said: “We are delighted to be welcoming AngularConnect to our International Convention Centre later this year. The launch of this event supports a growing trend of technology brands who are now choosing to host their event in London, with the likes of Adobe, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce.com and Hewlett Packard all running events at ExCeL this year. London represents the largest tech sector in Europe, with over 40,000 digital companies, so provides the ideal destination for an event such as AngularConnect.”\nSource: ExCeL London.\nRelated Posts ExCeL London and London wins three major awards London goes up in the list of the world’s best convention cities Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre announces a record 2014 as it celebrates its 10th anniversary Refreshed March Marketplace a success Justin King is set to raise the curtains for WTM 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:09:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
