A fast-moving thunderstorm that roared through parts of Bergen County early Wednesday morning — hurling lightning bolts, jolting people awake with resounding bursts of thunder and knocking trees over in several municipalities — was the result of warm, humid air colliding with cooler temperatures in the upper atmosphere, weather experts said.\n\"At 4:30 a.m., we were in the thick of it,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Engle, \"and by 5 o’clock, it was already exiting, moving north over Westchester County.\"\nEngle said the storm was so fast that it raced from Philadelphia to Maine \"in a matter of a couple of hours.\"\nA woman was hit and killed by a part of a tree knocked down by the storm in New Milford, and a downed tree caused damage to a house in Clifton, authorities said.\nThe wind peaked at 41 miles an hour as the storm tore through New Milford and Bergenfield at 4:31 a.m., said Bob Ziff of North Jersey Weather Observers, a local weather consultant. As the storm moved north into Haworth, the winds shifted suddenly from southwest to north, Ziff said.\nIn Upper Saddle River, a tree fell later in the afternoon, but authorities could not say if it was a result of having been weakened by the storm. The tree fell across wires on Upper Saddle River Road, causing localized power failures.\nA tree also was knocked down by the storm at Linwood Avenue and North Pleasant Avenue in Ridgewood and uprooted the sidewalk, but caused no other damage, authorities said.\nThe storm whipped parts of Paramus with rain so intensely that it left more than an inch in 15 minutes, Ziff said. \"We saw 1.11 inches from 4:10 to 4:25. That is an amazing amount of rain for such a short period of time.\"\nBut in nearby communities, little or no rain fell, a consequence of the storm moving out of the area so quickly, Ziff said.\n\"It was a small-scale disturbance caused by warm, humid air near the surface hitting cooler air in the upper atmosphere,\" said Engle, the weather service meteorologist.\n\"That caused an overturning of the atmosphere and strong downbursts or microbursts in localized areas,\" he explained.\nEngle said the weather conditions that caused the problems in North Jersey are sometimes associated with tornadoes, but no twisters were reported in the area. \"Tornadoes are another step up the ladder,\" he said, \"and tornado warnings were issued for the same storm in Maine.\"\nThe National Weather Service forecast for North Jersey called for more thunderstorms Wednesday night — but no indication that they would bring a repeat of Wednesday morning’s dramatic lightning, thunder and wind — followed by mostly sunny weather with a high of 86 degrees today and a chance of thunderstorms tonight.\nEmail: norman@northjersey.com", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_070215_L_stormdamage_RFM_65p.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:15:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
