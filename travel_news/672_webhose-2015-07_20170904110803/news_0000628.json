The good news for July 4 road warriors is that the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $2.76, down from $3.67 per gallon a year ago. \nThe U.S. Travel Association used the annual July 4 forecast to press elected officials to invest more in maintaining and upgrading roads and airports. \n\"Barbecues, picnics and road trips are staples of American summer vacation, but it seems being stuck in traffic jams and delayed on the tarmac are becoming equally a part of the tradition,\" said Roger Dow, president of the trade group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:39:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
