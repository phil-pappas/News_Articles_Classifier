Superman: Dawn of Justice.” But Quentin Tarantino was on hand to plug “The Hateful Eight,” Jennifer Lawrence charmed with details about the last “Hunger Games” installment, and the stars of hit television series such as “Supernatural” and “The Vampire Diaries” stirred crowds.\n“Convention” has become a catchall for many things of like-minded appeal, and that includes Galacticon 4, a sprawl of fanboy and fangirl bait happening July 31-Aug. 2 at Seattle Center. Ostensibly a three-day plunge into all things “Battlestar Galactica”— the science fiction franchise created for television by Glen A. Larson in 1978, and revived and spun off in multiple iterations over 35 years — Galacticon also offers a diverse menu of programs and guests from other fantasy touchstones.\nFESTIVAL PREVIEW Galacticon 4 July 31-Aug. 2, Seattle Center; $30-$275 ( galacticon.com ).\nAmong the highlights is a cast reunion from “Lost In Space,” the late-1960s CBS series about a family adrift in the cosmos. Stars Angela Cartwright, Bill Mumy, Marta Kristen and Mark Goddard will offer memories and insights.\nMost Read Stories Seattle police officer faces firing over arrest of man carrying a golf club Man killed by escort had axes, shovel, bleach; may be linked to missing women Seattle-area home prices hit wall in May Alaska Airlines has 72-hour sale on fall travel to Hawaii Boy Scouts OK gay leaders; Mormon church may quit Another golden oldie, NBC’s mid-1970s “Land of the Lost,” will be represented by original stars Philip Paley and Wesley Eure.\nCast members from the late, lamented “Firefly,” as well as TV’s “Farscape,” “Resurrection” and “Star Trek: The Next Generation” (recurring Klingons Robert O’Reilly and J.G. Hertzler) will join the fun.\nA number of stars and behind-the-scenes talent from the ever-expanding universe of “Battlestar Galactica” will dominate the proceedings. Led by Edward James Olmos from the rebooted, Emmy-nominated “Battlestar” of the 2000s, and Richard Hatch from both the original and later series, the guests from numerous episodic and TV movie productions include Grace Park, Tahmoh Penikett, Rehka Sharma, Michael Trucco, Terry Carter and Sarah Rush.\n“Battlestar Galactica” followed the adventures of human refugees from a devastating attack by an enemy race called the Cylons.\n“‘Battlestar’ had a strong sense of family and humanity in a post-apocalyptic situation,” says Hatch. “It dealt with what happens to people trying to find a new homeland and surviving life and death challenges, rebuilding a social architecture. Viewers were fascinated.”\nConceived in 1993 by Hatch (who played Captain Apollo in the first “Battlestar” and political leader Tom Zarek in the more recent show), Galacticon was first held at Universal City. Subsequent conventions have grown from that original vision.\nA true believer, Hatch has beaten the drum for more “Battlestar Galactica” over the years, even when no one seemed interested. In 1998-99, he produced a 20-minute trailer for a proposed new version of the show. Eventually there was a revived “Battlestar” — the one with Olmos — but Hatch’s pitch was bypassed. That was a bitter experience, softened when Hatch got to know the re-imagined “Battlestar’s” creator, Ronald D. Moore, who won a Peabody Award for his efforts.\n“I’ve always loved quality, visionary, intelligent sci-fi,” says Hatch, whose television credits include “Dynasty,” The Streets of San Francisco” and his superb performance as the brain-damaged pop star Jan Berry in 1978’s “Dead Man’s Curve.”\n“The genre talks about who we are as human beings, where we come from, where we’re going, who we’ll be in 300 or 3,000 years. What I loved about ‘Battlestar’ is that it could capture extreme circumstances and honestly explore what we might do.”\nTom Keogh: tomwkeogh@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T17:45:10.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
