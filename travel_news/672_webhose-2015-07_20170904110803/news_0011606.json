In response to 120 MPs signing a letter asking for it not to be used, Tony Hall has said any alternative name would be \"pejorative\" and the broadcaster must remain \"impartial\". Lord Hall of Birkenhead made the comments in a private reply to MPs. • Isil-linked terror group warned of Tunisia attack one month before • Family of 12 feared to have travelled to Syria In the letter, seen by the Times, Quote: : \"The BBC takes a common sense view when deciding how to describe organisations, we take our cue from the organisation's description of itself. \"We have recognised that used on its own the name Islamic State could suggest that such a state exists and such an interpretation is misleading. So we have caveated the name \"Islamic State\" with words which qualify it eg \"so called Islamic State\".\" Here is the letter behind tomorrow's @thetimes p1 story from BBC DG Tony Hall: http://t.co/6dKIK4yh9N pic.twitter.com/YFMu8hNrwM — Callum Jones (@CallumIJones) July 1, 2015 A BBC spokesman said the corporation had little choice other than to call the group “by the name it uses itself”. \"Anyone listening to what we say can be in no doubt as to what kind of organisation this is. We also use the terms 'extremist' and 'fighters' alongside it.\" He added: “We call the group by the name it uses itself, and regularly review our approach. We also use additional descriptions to help make it clear we are referring to the group as they refer to themselves, such as ‘so-called Islamic State’.” The MPs wanted to see the BBC and other broadcasters to adopt the name “Daesh” for the group. It was initiated by Rehman Chishti, the Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham, and also signed by the Tory London mayor, Boris Johnson, and the Labour chair of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz.
