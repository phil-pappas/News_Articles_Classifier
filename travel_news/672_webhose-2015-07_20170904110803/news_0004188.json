Also, the incorporation of Cuba as a destination by new shipping lines is expected,” says government Web site Cubadebate citing data from the Transportation Ministry.\nBetween 2012 and 2014, the number of cruise ship arrivals in Cuba multiplied six-fold.\nThe Havana Cruise Ship Terminal stands out among the tourist disembarkation points, followed by ports in the central province of Cienfuegos, Santiago de Cuba in the eastern part of the country, and the Isle of Youth in the southwest.\nTourism is the second-biggest source of income for Cuba, following the export of professional services.\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
