Free parking is available on the street within the Downtown Albany Business Improvement District and in three Albany Parking Authority-owned garages on weeknights and weekends, starting today. The goal is to attract visitors and make it easier for workers to eat, shop or socialize in downtown Albany after 5 p.m. \"It's trying to make downtown more accessible and friendly to people, so they'll want to come downtown and not be concerned about getting parking tickets and getting their car towed,\" said Brad Rosenstein , owner of Jack's Oyster House, a fine-dining restaurant on State Street. Rosenstein is also the board chairman of the Downtown Albany Business Improvement District. The parking initiative is a collaboration of Albany Parking Authority and the Downtown Albany BID.
