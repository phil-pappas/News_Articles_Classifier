Get TSA PreCheck or Global Entry \nIf you're headed for the US, sign up for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. The US Customs and Border protection pre-approval is basically a pre-flight upgrade, and will get you through security and onto the plane faster. \n2. Book red-eye flights for an emptier airport \nLong lines, crowded commutes, and traffic can be avoided by picking off-peak flights, especially overnight ones. \n3. Pick the security line that's all the way to the left \nResearch has found that because most people are right handed, they gravitate towards the right, leaving security lines on the left with fewer people. \n4. Or, pick the security line with the fewest staff Ad Feedback \nIf all the lines are equally long, choose the one with only one lone staffer staring at the computer. If there are two, chances are that one of them is being trained, and that pretty much every item will be stopped as it goes through the x-ray. \nREAD MORE \n* Will airport dates take off? \n5. Bring Ziploc bags \nInstead of awkwardly pulling shampoos and lotions out of your kit, keep liquids in a separate Ziploc to easily pull out of your carry on. Bring an extra one to throw in your keys, jewellery and change at security as well, rather than grappling with loose change on the other side, barefoot, while the guy behind you tries to push by. \n6. Pack extra densely to sneak on fluids \nThis might be risky, but the denser you pack your bag (lots of shoes, cables and electronics), the harder it is to see details on the x-ray, meaning that you might be able to sneak a bottle of wine onboard. However, you also risk losing it. \n7. Get liquids through security by freezing them \nIce is a solid, of course, so as long as liquids are frozen (make sure they don't melt by the time you get to the airport), they may be fine. \n8. Or, bring an empty bottle \nAnother way of bypassing the exorbitant cost of water at the airport is to simply bring an empty bottle. All airports have water fountains, and most even have water bottle filling stations. \n9. Take a screenshot of your mobile boarding pass \nMobile boarding passes can be fickle. Sometimes the app signs you out, sometimes it crashes, sometimes you just don't have service. Take a screenshot of your boarding pass for easy access and to bypass any app related issues. \n10. Avoid luggage cart fees \nMost airports no longer charge for luggage carts, but should you find yourself in one of the few airports that does, head to the pickup area to find a few strays that people have abandoned when getting picked up. Bonus: Smarte Carte will give you cash for returning carts. \n11. Be loyal to one airline \nLoyalty to an airline, as well as frequent flyer and reward programs, will get you perks like upgrades, lounge access, and priority boarding. \n12. Get the GateGuru app \nBasically an airport bible, this app tracks departure and arrival times, estimates checkpoint wait times, features terminal maps with ATMs, bathrooms, lounges, shops and restaurants, as well as reviews, and even helps with discounted Avis car rental bookings. You can also choose to get push notifications for real-time updates to your itinerary (like gate changes, security wait time changes, delays or layover time adjustments). Another fun feature is that the app stores your travel stats, keeping track of the airports you've visited, miles you've flown and how you compare to other users. \n13. Sit near a lounge for free wi-fi \nThis might not always work, but often at lounges the wi-fi signal is strong enough to extend beyond its doors, so sitting right outside of it may get you free wi-fi. \n14. Check FourSquare for free wi-fi \nFoursquare users not only post tips on the best meals, but often share wi-fi passwords. \n15. Try to get into the lounge for free \nMost lounges allow members to bring in a non-member. If you're friendly enough, you might be able to convince someone entering the lounge to sign you in as well. \n16. Download the LoungeBuddy app \nA handful of credit cards, like the Visa Black Card, Chase Ink Plus, Citi Prestige, and American Express Platinum, to name a few, either include free lounge access or a certain number of day passes a year. The LoungeBuddy app will not only help you figure out what lounges you can access by analysing your itinerary, credit cards and loyalty status, but also maps out what lounges are nearby, as well as traveller's reviews of lounges around the world. \n17. Or, treat yourself to a lounge pass \nMost airport lounges sell day passes, and others aren't affiliated with airlines at all. While these passes can be pricey (though buying them online in advance is usually a lot cheaper), if you have a lot of time to kill you might end up saving money, since access to the lounge includes wi-fi and food, both of which are notoriously expensive at airports. \n18. Bring a double adapter \nThere are never ever enough outlets at airports, so bring your own splitter and make some new friends. \n19. Know where to get some shuteye \nAirport chapels are a good place to find some peace and quiet, but if you're looking to catch some zzzs, check Sleepinginairports.net for the best places to sleep at airports around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T08:51:05.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
