However, the Wilhelma Zoologisch-Botanischer Garten in Stuttgart, Germany, is particularly beautiful and worth visiting. Pelicans admire the view of the Wilhelma Zoo \nWilhelma was initially built as a royal palace, and now sits on a 30-hectare plot of land, split between a zoo and botanical garden, in the northern suburbs of Stuttgart, Germany. It was built from 1842 to 1853, for King Wilhelm I of Wuerttemberg, and contains a large number of Moorish elements, giving it the nickname “Alhambra am Neckar.” The original historic building was destroyed during World War II, but the city has done a wonderful job rebuilding. The glasshouse at the Wilhelma Botanical Gardens A birds-eye-view of the botanical gardens Flowers are everywhere at Wilhelma \nIt is Europe’s only large combined zoological and botanical garden, and home to over eight thousand animals representing more than one thousand different species, as well as more than five thousand species of plants. Colour abounds, even in the summer heat Wandering the quiet paths of the botanical garden \nI was particularly impressed with the Sequoia patch, tall enough to give you the impression they reach the sky, as well as the large apes exhibit. The apes here are allowed to keep their clans whole, not removing the offspring. I appreciate how the zoo does not feel like a prison, with the barriers between humans and animals kept to the necessary minimum. It’s a characteristic of many German zoos. Japanese macaques live in their clans as they would in the wild \nAnother beautiful aspect of the zoo is the large magnolia grove. It’s spectacular in spring and, with the centrally located pond, hosting a large variety of water lilies, this alone makes it worth the visit. Worth the trip in itself – the water-lilly garden \nApart from the gardens, you have the usual zoo animals, large cats, elephants, polar bears, as well as a huge insectarium and aquarium.

At 40C there is nobody around so if you are as crazy as we are, go now and enjoy. \n[Editor’s note:] For those of you in Belgium, don’t miss the Pairi Daiza Zoo and Botanical Garden in Wallonia . It’s a CheeseWeb favourite!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:22:08.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
