The Telegraph was exultant – its leader on page 8 proclaiming that “the campaign just concluded must stand in history as one of the more remarkable in the annals of our Empire” and Botha’s victory “is the climax of one of the most amazing romances in the history of the British World-State,” which was probably true considering he was the enemy little more than a decade previously. And if this wasn’t enough, readers could find out more about the campaign on page 6 and see a map of most of the newly-conquered territory. Also in today’s paper - “Beer, so inseparably associated with the life of the average German, has become a luxury in the Fatherland” due to a dearth of barley, but England has no such problem – page 4 . The article ges on to reveal that “the patriotism of many people” in England “makes them suspicious of the word “lager.” - The editor of the West Essex Gazette is fine for publishing information about the Royal Navy, as it is deemed to be potentially useful to the enemy – page 4 - The Russian victory near Lublin is proclaimed to have fatally prevented the realisation of the Austro-German plan of attack in the region – page 9 - Lord Kitchener’s been busy – visiting the front (where his presence is interestingly given more prominence than that of Herbert Asquith who was also there) and giving a “stirring appeal for men” as it is his turn to give a speech at London’s Guildhall to boost the recruiting campaign – pages 9 and 10 - Another attempt is made on the life of the Sultan of Egypt (see April 9 for the previous one) – page 9 - An American journalist predicts “The Allies will be victorious.” – page 9 . If he had predicted the opposite, would it have been reported though? - Australia is looking at following Britain’s lead and creating a National Register of its own – page 9 - The women’s page ( page 12 ) looks at ideas for summer food, and “good and inexpensive fare” such as Macaroni Croquettes and Baked Tripe Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:41:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
