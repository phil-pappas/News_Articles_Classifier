Although they applied lean start-up principles to their own business – they held meetings above pubs before launching a three-day summer start-up camp, and built up their online course gradually. Mr McCahill acknowledges that sometimes he prefers to rely on instinct. “Carlos prefers to make decisions based on data,” he says, “but I’m more gut-driven.” Lean methodology is all about turning traditional ideas on their head to make your business as successful and efficient as it can be. It’s about ditching old rules, following new ones and occasionally just tearing up the rule book altogether. We mix and match instead of investing in a developer to build from scratch Lean start-ups grew out of the lean manufacturing systems pioneered by companies such as Toyota. Business gurus such as Eric Ries realised that lean tools could make the process of founding a business more efficient and less wasteful, bypassing expensive mistakes by adapting to customer feedback at an earlier stage. Soon businesses were abandoning the classic start-up sequence of detailed planning, elaborate prototypes, complex business plans and a grand launches. Instead, the business plan would be replaced by a business model canvas – a summary of untested hypotheses about how the business would pan out. The business would seek detailed feedback from potential customers in the customer development phase, and rather than creating one perfect, highly-designed prototype, would develop a minimum viable product – the product that would give it the highest return on its investment versus the risk involved – on which it would seek customer feedback. For Ozana Giusca’s business, Tooliers, which provides online business growth tools to businesses – discovering lean start-up methodology was transformational. Her initial idea for the business, in 2011, involved a complex and expensive website, which she had to discard when it became apparent that the tools were not presented in an appealing way and the website was inadequate. The next version of the business was launched on lean principles, with a cautious, incremental approach to building the site and extensive customer interviews. “The result is much more customer-focused,” says Giusca. “The current programmes are a combination of tools and human interaction. I see it as a transition to using tools only, but for now that’s what people really like.” Both businesses apply the same, smart, flexible approach to their technology as they do to their start-ups. Most of Giusca’s team works remotely, so the right technology is essential. “What has been invaluable has been discovering all sorts of tools and systems and softwares in the cloud that we can use,” she says. “We mix and match instead of investing in a developer to build from scratch.” McCahill agrees on the importance of flexibility. “You have to keep on your toes with what’s coming out that can potentially help businesses be more productive or creative or mobile,” he says. For all small businesses, applying the lean start-up philosophy to decisions about technology means looking hard at whether it is working efficiently and delivering the savings you need.
