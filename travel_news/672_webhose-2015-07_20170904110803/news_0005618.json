We believe the suit is completely without merit, and the Company will take appropriate steps to respond. The specific allegations made by IBT Local 357 are incomplete and factually incorrect. \nThe IBT and the Company are currently in the middle of negotiations supervised by the National Mediation Board for an amended collective bargaining agreement. \nThe Company stands ready with its current proposal to make a significant investment in our pilots, which is not only fair and equitable, but would place our pilots ahead of their peers in the regional airline industry. This lawsuit is nothing more than an improper tactic by IBT Local 357 to distract our employees and pressure the Company with respect to the negotiations process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T00:42:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
