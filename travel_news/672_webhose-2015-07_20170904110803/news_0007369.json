So Belinda Lewis Held had to be creative when it came to sheltering the more than 1,000 young people she’s guiding that weekend: they’ll be bunking down in museums, classrooms and churches. \n“They’re young and they don’t mind the floors. They’ll bring sleeping bags or yoga mats and pillows,” said Lewis Held, director of group travel for APilgrimsJourney.com , a Pittsburgh company that organizes worldwide Catholic tours. “They’re willing to rough it for Pope Francis.” \nWith the papal visit imminent and the city’s 11,500 hotel rooms filling up quickly, wannabe visitors are thinking outside the box (spring) when it comes to lodgings, particularly when they want to keep costs down. \nPhiladelphia officials may permit camping in some public parks, and untraditional offerings have appeared online. On Airbnb , a Delaware River houseboat and a converted dance studio were made available to rent. Craigslist had a listing for an empty warehouse and multiple couch surfing options. \nLewis Held’s company, which caters to large groups of any age, found more traditional hotels for older pilgrims but knew from experience that she could look elsewhere for younger visitors. \n“The goal is to keep costs down to make the trip possible for as many people as possible,” Lewis Held said. Her company is working with four Roman Catholic dioceses in western Pennsylvania. The Erie Diocese’s youth package, for example, costs $300 per person and includes bus transportation to the city, overnight accommodations, five meals and a commemorative papal flag and hat. \nThe pontiff will arrive in the U.S. from Cuba on Sept. 22.
