For the third year running, Brighton Dome collaborated with the University of Sussex to produce two of the videos. A brief was provided to Media Studies students who presented pitches in small teams to a panel. The two final pieces were then chosen to be placed on the Brighton Dome website and were shown to the whole year of media studies students. \nAndrew Comben, Chief Executive of Brighton Dome & Brighton Festival commented: “We were delighted to work with the University of Sussex again this year. We are extremely proud of the final videos and would like to urge everyone to go online and take a look. They truly encapsulate the reasons so many companies across the UK and further afield are booking their events at Brighton Dome.” Paul Vincent, Media Practice Teaching Fellow, The School of Media Film & Music at the University of Sussex stated: “Our students have gained valuable knowledge and understanding from working with Brighton Dome, it has given them all the experience of working professionally, with real world clients, industry structures and deadlines, whilst having the opportunity to produce published portfolio work. I look forward to continuing to develop this valued relationship when we work together again in the Autumn.” One of the chosen videos is entitled ‘what is on our doorstep’ and showcases why Brighton is such a fantastic location for events. Recent event client Gary Robson, Head of Customer Service at London and Quadrant agreed: “London and Quadrant wanted to get out of the City and head to the seaside for our staff annual away day this year. Brighton was the ideal choice for us due to its proximity to London and its plethora of entertainment on offer.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:11:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
