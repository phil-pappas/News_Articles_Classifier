He cuts a much leaner figure, and his hair is cut much shorter: the very embodiment of austerity. Politically though he’s a more substantial politician than he was just a few years back. It’s now perfectly possible to talk about Mr Osborne as a potential prime minister; some even reckon him the man to beat. • July Budget 2015 LIVE: Welfare bill to take centre stage • What time is the summer Budget? • What to expect at the 'Emergency Budget' Some of this is presentational. He simply cuts a more convincing figure than he did when entered office in 2010. His speeches are better and his interviews more assured. He’ll never be the people’s darling, but he’s becoming a more sympathetic, engaging character. As one of his colleagues puts it, not unkindly: “The trouble George has is that even when he’s trying to be nice you can still feel like he’s sneering at you. But he is trying, and people do appreciate that.” Besides, the importance of “connecting”, Blair-style, with voters can be overstated. All the polling evidence before the election suggested that most voters considered Ed Miliband to be much more “in touch” with their lives than David Cameron, better able to understand “people like me”. It didn’t matter, because voters rated Mr Cameron more highly on other things, like competence, strength and decisiveness. They didn’t have to like Mr Cameron to keep him on as PM. They just had to think he was the best man for the job. Remember that when the merits of future Tory leaders are discussed. More importantly, Mr Osborne has also started to define his own agenda in public. Mr Osborne has always had views that are distinct from those of his boss (Mr Cameron describes himself as a more traditional sort of Tory than the metropolitan Mr Osborne) but for many years took pains to keep them slightly hidden, wary of anything that could look like division between PM and chancellor. Yes, he exercised huge influence within the government, from personnel to strategy. But he did so because Mr Cameron subcontracted decisions to him. There’s a difference between being a trusted consigliere and a don with your own family, a distinction not often properly understood at Westminster. But slowly, the Osborne Agenda is emerging into the light. We’ve had the Northern Powerhouse and quiet but firm pressure for relaxing planning rules to help build more houses and boost businesses. Less publicly, there are always whispers about a more liberal approach to immigration than the PM. Both No 10 and Team Osborne appear very relaxed about the Chancellor being seen as his own man rather than a vassal of the PM; everyone knows there’s a leadership vacancy coming sooner or later, so why shouldn’t Mr Osborne have his time in the limelight? Importantly here, Mr Osborne is proving to be a good thief, adept at pinching bright ideas from others. Labour people, missing the point, squeal that he nicked the Northern Powerhouse theme from them. That comes after he stole the Lib Dem tax policy of jacking up the starting threshold for income tax, and then decorated it with the language of Blue Collar Conservatism, again a concept he’s appropriated from others. In his Budget today, it will be no surprise if he moves on the living wage and the working poor, a cause Boris Johnson has tried to make his own. Yet for all the rebranding and restyling, for all the intellectual heavy-lifting and light fingers, Mr Osborne is a contender because of his record, both political and economic. He was at least jointly responsible for the big wager of the last Parliament, that deficit reduction would deliver a recovery, and votes. Now, you can debate the economic consequences of his fiscal policy ad nauseaum: maybe fiscal tightening actually delayed the recovery, and maybe he actually eased off on austerity, even if he doesn’t like to admit it. But politically what matters is how voters see all this. And they bought his argument that Labour spent all the money and that he had to balance the books if Britain was to prosper again. He himself may not have believed the Conservatives would win a majority (unlike other Tories who want to rewrite the history of the election campaign, he admits he was expecting a minority Tory administration) but he’s looking like the biggest single beneficiary of it, while potential rivals are left looking for ways to match his pace. • Budget 2015: income tax and personal allowance • Seven charts you need to see before the 'Emergency Budget' • Has George Osborne been a business friendly Chancellor? • How inheritance tax changes might affect you Politics is a zero-sum game, and the unkind talk around the Cabinet table is that Mr Johnson has been the biggest loser from Mr Osborne’s recent gains. His call this week for a cut in the top rate of income tax – something Mr Osborne is cool on -- was seen by some MPs as a slightly panicked appeal to the Tory benches from a London Mayor who has struggled to make a real impact in Parliament since returning to the Commons in May. Some people close to the Chancellor reckon this will be his most consequential budget. It certainly should be: he comes to the Commons today with political capital to burn, an opposition in disarray and a five-year Parliament stretching out before him. If he is going to make the move next door one day, today’s the day we get our first real glimpse of Prime Minister George Osborne. The UK Government debt total is now...
