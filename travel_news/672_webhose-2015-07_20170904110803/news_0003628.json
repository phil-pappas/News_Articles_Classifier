For the macerated cherries, strain the cherries and place in a bowl with the fruit sugar and raspberry vinegar. Cover and set aside. 2. To make the cherry jelly, soften the gelatine in tepid water. Boil the vodka in a pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Cool slightly, then stir in the vinegar and gelatine to dissolve. 3. For the camomile custard, gently heat the milk, cream and camomile leaves until simmering. Cover and steep for 30 minutes, then strain. Weigh 300g of this mix and return it to a simmer. Soften the gelatine in tepid water. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until light and creamy. Pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisk well and put back in the pan. Heat to 82C, then add softened gelatine and stir to dissolve. Sieve and place over an iced water bath to cool. 4. For the cherry cream, boil the vodka over a high heat until reduced to about 80g (100ml). Cool. Whisk the cream, icing sugar and vodka to medium peaks. Cover and refrigerate. 5. For the salted sugared almonds, coat the nuts with egg white and a pinch of salt. Dry in a preheated oven (170C/gas mark 3) for 10 minutes. Heat the sugar and 40g of water to 135C. Add the almonds, then remove the pan from the heat and whisk until the sugar crystallises. Pour on to a parchment-lined tray and allow to cool. Break into small pieces. 6. For the sponge fingers, dissolve the amaretto and sugar in a pan over medium heat. Cool. Place the sponge fingers in a deep-sided tray and pour over syrup. Leave until the liquid is absorbed. 7. To assemble, line a glass bowl with the fingers. Place the cherries on top, pour over the jelly and chill. Once set, pour the custard on top and re-chill. Pipe on the cream and sprinkle with popping candy, lime zest, freeze-dried strawberries and the almond pieces.
