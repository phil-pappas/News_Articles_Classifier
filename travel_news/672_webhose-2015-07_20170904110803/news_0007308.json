The court dismissed the evidence presented in the case by police and the prosecution as insufficient. \nHarsh Goenka, the billionaire owner of the RPG Goenka conglomerate, said recently that the IPL had “suddenly become a bad word”, prompting him to rethink earlier plans to invest in an IPL franchise. \nThe acquittal came on the heels of two IPL teams being banned earlier this month as a result of a separate probe led by a retired Indian Supreme Court chief justice. The teams — the Royals and the Chennai Super Kings — have been banned from the tournament for two years. \nThat ban followed allegations that executives at the two teams had been linked to illegal betting activities during the same 2013 season. \nSreesanth and his two teammates were arrested in a police operation known as Operation U-turn. The three were accused of “spot fixing” — in which elements of a match are rigged in exchange for money — which police claimed was linked to criminal betting syndicates. \nThis latest twist in the saga comes as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is attempting to salvage the next season of the TV-friendly IPL, whose combination of financial firepower and showbiz razzmatazz has shaken up the sport since its launch in 2008. \nMoves to ban the two franchises, which were not directly related to this weekend’s criminal case, have cut the IPL’s teams from eight to six, hitting the value of broadcasting rights and heightening unease among corporate sponsors. \nThe BCCI is now struggling to develop a new format for the 2016 season, potentially involving the creation of temporary franchises, although the idea has found little support among potential team owners. \n6 \nNumber of teams in the IPL for the 2016 season \n“One hears of so much muck from the [other] team owners,” Mr Goenka wrote in an op-ed in the Economic Times, an Indian business newspaper. “To invest in a team now will mean dealing with losses for some time.” \nBefore this weekend’s verdict the three players had already been banned for life by the BCCI. Despite the collapse of the case, the BCCI on Saturday said it had no plans to revisit the bans. \n“Any disciplinary proceeding or decision taken by the BCCI is independent to any criminal proceeding,” the body said, according to Press Trust of India. “The decisions of the BCCI . . . shall remain unaltered.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
