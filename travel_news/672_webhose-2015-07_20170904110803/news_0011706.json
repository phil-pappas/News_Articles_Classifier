Despite its white fur, it's neither a polar bear nor an albino. The rare creature results from the mating of two black bears carrying a recessive gene.\nMealtime Douglas Neasloss, Spirit Bear Lodge Grizzlies gorge on salmon during the fall spawning season, before hibernating for the winter. Grizzlies gorge on salmon during the fall spawning season, before hibernating for the winter. (Douglas Neasloss, Spirit Bear Lodge) The yearning to see a spirit bear is what lured Anna and John Ayre to this coast, the only place on the planet where the bears are found. The Ayres are among a small but growing number of wildlife enthusiasts traveling to remote bear-viewing lodges along the British Columbia coast.\nPatience paid off last September as a young spirit bear rambled along the creek bed not far from the Ayres and their fellow visitors.\n\"When you see the bear, it's like a magical experience. Your whole body is suspended somehow,\" Anna Ayre said of the remarkable sighting during the Hendersonville, N.C., couple's second visit to Spirit Bear Lodge in the tiny native village of Klemtu. As his wife watched in awe, John Ayre clicked away with his camera. Photos, not a bear rug, would be their trip's trophies.\nSuch contact isn't uncommon when the salmon are spawning and the bears are hungry. Tim McGrady, the lodge's general manager, was guiding some guests when they witnessed two spirit bears together last fall.\nl Related Travel St. Augustine is feeling a lot younger than 450 See all related 8 \"The mom brought her cub down to investigate these humans,\" he recalled. \"The mom had obviously spent a lot of time around us over the years and was introducing her cub to these strange humans that come and sit and watch them.\"\nScattered lodges dot the sprawling Great Bear Rainforest along the stunning Inside Passage waterway, about 70 minutes by air north of Vancouver. It often takes three or four flights in commercial aircraft, plus a ride in a floatplane or boat, to reach the habitat of spirit bears, their kindred black bears and grizzlies. Those who have experienced the close encounters say they're well worth the effort â€” and the expense.\n\"We let the bears pretty much set the distance,\" noted Tom Rivest, owner of Great Bear Lodge on Smith Inlet, a 30-minute flight from Port Hardy. Sometimes, the bears will calmly stroll to within 10 feet of the human visitors.\n\"Our behavior is fairly ritualized,\" said Rivest, a wildlife biologist. \"The animals that know us often will just look up, but they know what's going on, so they go back to feeding and don't look at us again.\"\nThe bears sometimes become so comfortable that they allow the camera-toting humans to baby-sit.\n\"A huge grizzly bear mama brought her cubs within, I'd say, about 15 feet of us and parked them there,\" Spirit Bear Lodge's Tim McGrady said. \"They just fell on top of each other and snoozed while she went off along the river to fish. She came back about half an hour later with this massive chum salmon, picked up her cubs and headed off into the forest.\n\"Without that human presence, you'd never see a mom leave her cubs for that length of time,\" he continued. \"That's the kind of experience we have fairly regularly with bears.\"\n While the season runs from May to October, the best time to see an abundance of bears is late summer and early fall. That's when they feast on fish before moving to their winter dens to hibernate.\n\"We have a 10-week, very intensive peak season where we'll see upwards of 400 people come into this little village, literally from around the world,\" McGrady said.\nVisitors to Klemtu are greeted by drum-beating locals, many of whom have never ventured outside the town. The Kitasoo/Xaixais band (community) owns the lodge; most of the employees are natives.\n\"It's a really neat, cross-cultural experience,\" McGrady noted. \"(Guests) go away with a really different notion of this culture that's existed along the coast for at least the last 9,000 to 10,000 years.\"\nThere's tension, though, in the rain forest. Sport hunting is legal in the province, and rifle-toting visitors come in hopes of shooting a grizzly or black bear. Hunting spirit bears is illegal.\n\"That's a real conflict for us,\" McGrady said, adding that 10 native bands try to prohibit hunting on their land.\n\"Trophy hunting is not a part of their culture,\" he observed. \"They never hunted for sport. They hunted for food.\"\nA 2013 opinion poll revealed that 87 percent of British Columbians believe bear hunting should be banned. As funds allow, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, based in Sidney, British Columbia, is buying up hunting rights in the Great Bear Rainforest to keep commercial operators from organizing hunts.\n\"In our view, there is no ecological, no economic or ethical reason to be killing these bears for recreation,\" the foundation's Chris Genovali said.\nJay Jones is a freelance writer.\nIf you go\nBear-viewing adventures can be expensive.
