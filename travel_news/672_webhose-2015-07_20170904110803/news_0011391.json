Summer festivals include the Outside the Box performing arts festival, July 14-19; Revere Beach National Sand-Sculpting Festival, July 24-26; Boston Seafood Festival, Aug. 2; and a series of feasts and festivals in the famous North End neighborhood, including the St. Agrippina di Mineo Feast (July 30-31 and Aug. 1-2), the Madonna Della Cava Feast (Aug. 7-9), Fisherman’s Feast of the Madonna Del Soccorso di Sciacca (Aug. 13-16) and St. Anthony’s Feast (Aug. 28-30).\nOther outdoor events include Wednesday concerts on the Esplanade with the Boston Landmarks Orchestra (July 15-Aug. 26), Shakespeare on the Common’s “King Lear” (July 22-Aug. 9) and the Boston Summer Arts Weekend in Copley Square (July 25-26). A free weekend shuttle to Columbia Point takes visitors to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate, the Commonwealth Museum and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n The city’s twice-yearly restaurant promotion, Dine Out Boston, is Aug. 16-21 and 23-28. At the Boston Opera House, “Kinky Boots” plays Aug. 11-30.\nApps for dining out are on the menu\nTravel + Leisure magazine’s July issue focuses on food and includes recommendations for four apps that T+L says are “changing the way we eat out.”\nMost restaurantgoers are familiar with Yelp, Chowhound and OpenTable, but T+L has picked out a few that aren’t on most diners’ radar just yet.\nTocktix.com allows diners to book a table at select restaurants and prepay for meals, with discounts for off-peak dining. Table8.com and Resy.com sell last-minute reservations for a $20 to $30 surcharge, while Reserve.com offers a “personal dining concierge service,” arranging bookings for a $5 fee.\n———\nBeth Harpaz, Associated Press\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T07:47:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
