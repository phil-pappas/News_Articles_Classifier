The popular notion that inkjet printing is for consumers while serious businesses upgrade to laser technology has been well and truly disproved by new figures highlighted by InfoTrends. In 2014, 14.6m inkjet units were shipped in western Europe, representing year-on-year growth of 3.5pc. Significantly, business inkjet printers designed for SME use showed the strongest growth of all, with an 18.6pc increase over 2013 sales. The reasons behind the increasing use of inkjet printers by SMEs are not difficult to understand. Advances in technology, spearheaded by HP, have produced the fastest and most economical generation of business inkjet printers yet, packed with features designed to make life easier for a small business. What’s the secret of HP’s success? Quite simply, quality, speed and efficiency What’s the secret of HP’s success in this area? Quite simply, quality, speed and efficiency. HP PageWide technology features a stationary printhead, pockmarked with more than 40,000 tiny nozzles, that spans the width of a page. The paper moves, but the printhead doesn’t. A concentration of 1,200 nozzles per inch ensures a consistently high print quality. An often overlooked factor when discussing printing technology is the ink (or colourant) itself. The secret of good printer ink is that it immobilises quickly on contact with paper. If it spreads across the surface or penetrates too deeply into the sheet, the result is less vivid colours, lighter, less eye-catching blacks and more indistinct lines. Original HP pigment ink is designed to remain at or very near the paper surface. When it is fired from PageWide printheads at a uniquely uniform drop weight, speed, and trajectory, you can expect consistently precise images and text. That’s the science, and the result is a printed page of professional quality that will impress customers and inspire staff, and all achieved in a single pass. The specially formulated pigment ink also resists smearing, water spills and highlighter smudges. But a new benchmark in print quality is only one benefit of HP PageWide printers. The technology, which is available as standard in the HP OfficeJet X series, also prints for up to half the cost per page of colour lasers, and uses up to 50 per cent less energy. The stationary printhead and single print pass mean the OfficeJet X series is as quiet and reliable as inkjet printing gets. The OfficeJet Pro X500 series is officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest desktop printer in the world In fact, the OfficeJet Pro X500 series is officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest desktop printer in the world And in the real world of business, that can make all the difference. It means no log jams at the printer, and no wasted time waiting for an important document to reach the front of the printer queue. Paper trays, which take either 250 or 500 sheets as standard (up to 1,050 for the Pro X), and double-sided printing further reduce employee downtime. As you’d expect, the OfficeJet X series also happily prints from smartphones and tablets, so your staff are never chained to their desks. With all this in mind, it’s no wonder that InfoTrends highlights an increasing take-up of business-standard inkjet printers. The UK is proving a particularly strong market for the latest generation of high-spec units, as SMEs recognise that market-leading designs such as the HP OfficeJet X series offer a real opportunity to save money, boost productivity and make a professional impression with customers and staff alike.
