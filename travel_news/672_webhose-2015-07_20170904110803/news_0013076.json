Relax in a Muskoka chair by the crackling fire to the sounds of some of Canada’s award-winning musicians in The Campfire Lounge. Have some play time at the Kids Zone, where little ones can take part in Canadian-themed activities like the Map of Canada puzzle wall, colouring sheets and more. Head over to the I Love Canada Zone and write down a reason why you love Canada on a sticky note and place it on the wall to help build the Canadian flag. Test your knowledge of Canada by collecting Camp Pearson trivia cards at various retail locations. On Friday evenings, sample some Canadian-inspired menu items from airport chefs. \n“We have created a pre-flight experience reflective of the best elements of summer in Canada,” said Scott Collier, vice-president of Customer and Terminal Services at Toronto Pearson. “Celebrating summer at Toronto Pearson means Muskoka chairs, sampling Canadian food, expressing national pride and making new memories.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T05:34:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
