A survey of 1000 doctors by the Alzheimer's Society found that fewer than one in ten think people with dementia get enough statutory support to maintain a good diet or have adequate company. Three in five GPs (61 per cent) say lack of cooperation between the NHS and social care acts as a barrier to patients getting support, while many (73 per cent) also think patients, families and carers are left confused by the health and social care system. The charity said that hundreds of thousands of people were being let down and called for the Government to ensure that everyone diagnosed with dementia is entitled to a full package of support including a Dementia Adviser. It also wants to see better help and support available for carers, with a single point of contact available to help them navigate the health and social care system. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of Alzheimer's Society, said: \"Our survey gives a stark view from the doctor's surgery of people with dementia left struggling in the aftermath of a diagnosis. \"GPs report an endemic and deeply worrying lack of support available from health and social services, with relatives left to pick up the pieces alone. \"People can need a lot of help to live well with dementia. Families and friends are a vital source of support but they mustn't be relied on to do everything. As dementia takes hold, people with dementia and their carers look to statutory services to give them the back-up they desperately need to cope. \"With the number of people with dementia expected to grow to one million by 2021, there is no time to waste. Today's findings reinforce the urgency of putting in place meaningful care and support for all people with dementia.\" • Lifestyle changes 'could protect 80,000 from dementia' • These touching photos show what early onset dementia looks like • Dementia drivers 'as dangerous as gunmen’ One of the many people feeling desperate for help is Stephen Blakeburn, 50, from Darlington, County Durham. He cares for his mother, Jenny, 86, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2010. He said: \"Since my mum was diagnosed with dementia, it's been a constant, all-consuming battle to get her the support she needs. \"We feel like we've been failed by a system which doesn't work for us. After two care assessments which led to nothing, I've been left with no option but to drastically cut down my hours at work so I can take care of her. \"I love my mum dearly and want to do everything I can to support her, but sometimes it gets too much and it's very overwhelming. I feel like my life is on hold. \"As well as financial assistance, I really just need someone to support us both by giving me some time off and respite for mum.\" Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T02:32:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
