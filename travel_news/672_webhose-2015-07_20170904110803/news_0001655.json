Both pilgrimages hold utmost significance among Muslims of various ethnic groups and act as a holy gesture that defines their Islamic existence. Every year millions of Muslims visit Mecca and Medina to perform hajj and experience the divinity of the fifth pillar of Islam. Very few pilgrims have created such a breakthrough in bringing sea of Muslims together as Hajj and Umrah did. Hajj is the most important obligation for Muslims that occurs in the month of Dhul Hijjah, which is the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. It's a worship that every Muslim must undertake once in a lifetime, if they are physically and financially stable. Umrah, on the other hand, can be performed at any time of the year. Today, there is no limit to travel organizers and trip advisors who are dedicated to make your journey to Mecca a successful endeavor. They offer a great deal of services and attractive packages to offer you a comfortable and delightful traveling experience. However, the staggering amount of packages can confuse you very easily, so make sure you take some time and do optimum research before opting to any package. Below, we have compiled a list of some factors you can look for before picking up a package that helps you undertake this spiritual journey with complete sincerity and commitment. 1. Pick up a Registered Agent To enjoy a journey that guarantees comfort and peace of mind, it is crucial to have a registered and certified travel partner on board. Double check if the agent is registered with the Ministry of Hajj or not. Handing over your trip responsibility to someone whose presence is legally known will help you take up a successful journey. 2. Availability of Imam Imam is a worship leader of a mosque and he is responsible to perform hajj with the pilgrims. While selecting a package, make sure that you agent is providing an access to Imam. There are times, when Imam isn't staying with you or staying in a different hotel or tent. This makes quite difficult for you to keep in touch with him or perform rituals wholeheartedly. To make your journey smooth, select a partner who is ready to offer one or two Imams in a package. 3. Women Assistance Picking up an agent who also provides a female guide would be an added advantage as it helps your sisters and mothers perform hajj comfortably. 4. Food and Accommodation It is always recommended to choose an accommodation which is near to the Haram and Masjid-e-Nabwi instead of staying in a place that consumes your precious hours in travelling. Traveling to Mecca and Medina must be well planned in advance from start to finish. Make sure you implement the above mentioned tips to choose a package that reduces your worries and lets you concentrate on Allah wholeheartedly.
