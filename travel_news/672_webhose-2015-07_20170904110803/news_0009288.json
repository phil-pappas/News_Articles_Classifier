But when the skies open up and the rain deluge starts, you’d better have something more than a flimsy travel umbrella along. Like if you’re hiking around, say, Loch Lomond in Scotland . Or it’s summer in Iceland. Or you’re in the mountains of Central America during “green season.” \nMy first impression of this jacket was that it fit great on my thin frame, but the zippers were in an odd place. Then I realized that when I had a backpack on, they were in the perfect place. They were placed above the waist strap. The zipper pulls are easy to get to and you get three seam-sealed pockets to choose from. I also liked the pit zips under the arms: you zip those open when you get heated up and the hot air can go out through the mesh underneath. \nIf you’re not overheated though, you can just let the Omni-Dry do its work. This three-layer jacket has a breathable membrane in the style of Gore-tex or Polartec, but there are claims (with some grounding in science) that the Omni-Dry system works better. The various brands all say that of course and the average person can’t tell the difference. The bottom line is, if the air is cooler than the inside of the jacket, the moist sweat vapor will escape and you’ll feel cooler. This would be a great spring skiing jacket for when the weather is iffy. \nThis is not a wispy little jacket that will only hold off a light drizzle. I wore this is a pouring rain for a half-hour walk across town to test it out in those conditions and put newspaper inside and left it in the shower for a while. In both case, nothing inside got even slightly damp. \nThere are all kinds of features in this that you tend to only find in top-end shells. There are the articulated sleeves with velcro adjustment cuffs, adjustable cinch cords for the hood (top and side) and bottom, and soft microfiber around the neck. There are also reflective details for when you’re caught out at night and cars have a tougher time seeing you in the rain. It also comes with its own stuff pouch for packing. \nColumbia is known for putting out quality gear that’s at a much lower price point than the stratosphere brands like Helly Hansen and Arc’teryx. This Loch Lomand rain jacket looks quite expensive and is at the top of this brand’s range, but that’s still half what some others charge for something similar. It lists for $275 and is currently on sale for less on the Columbia website . It comes in blue or black in several sizes. You can also pick it up at REI or Sierra Trading Post .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:53:54.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
