Devised by head barman Alex Kratena, this year’s list is inspired by Surrealism and is an innovative and fantastical as expected. Sesame, leather, smoke and amber are some of the more unconventional ingredients given an airing here – I was particularly taken with a drink called Spring Drifting into Summer, which features Ketel One, shochu, artichoke, yuzu and coriander – and, as ever, presentation is in a class of its own. Drinks might be served in orbs suspended from string, encased in the body of a brass ant or within a clasped box. In fact, creating the custom-made glassware Kratena believes best complements his drinks has this year cost £145,000 – a staggering some to spend on drinking vessels alone, and a figure that goes some way in showing how much effort has gone in to creating the £18 (or £10 for non-alcoholic) cocktails. Launched by Virgin Atlantic and Delta and Inspired by the airlines’ business- and first-class lounges, NY-LON at the O2 is a lounge bar that aims to “bring the best of New York and London style, design, glamour and mixology to London’s O2 [alongside] the undeniable buzz of checking in to a first-class lounge”. So it’s rather ambitious. Other elements won’t surprise too much, though: dishes will feature New York-inspired cured meats and London fish pies, while cocktails will be aviation-themed. The venue, which opens at the end of the month, accommodates 400 in total so it should also be a lot more lively than the average, exclusive lounge setting. Another London rooftop restaurant , albeit temporary, Brooksby’s Walk is an al fresco dining destination and bar catering to the denizens of Homerton and beyond. Devised by Jarrod Cooke and chef Giorgio Ravelli, who previously worked together at Upstairs at the Ten Bells, it will offer Northern Italian sharing plates, seasonal cocktails and a weekly barbecue. Near Chatsworth Road, the building it is found in was originally a public toilet. To celebrate the launch of the group’s Ling Ling restaurant in Mykonos this summer, Hakkasan’s long-standing outposts in Hanway Place and Mayfair will serve three limited-edition Ling Ling-inspired menus (fish and seafood; meat and seafood; vegetarian) throughout July and August. Drawing from the Greek venue’s izakaya (or informal Japanese bar) concept, dishes on offer in London will include crispy aubergine and shitake salade, grilled Childean seabass in honey and cocktails including the Ling Ling Collins; in Hanway Place the menus are priced at £35, in Mayfair it’s £45. If you’re from Ireland and remember a TV show called The Lyrics Board, where two competing teams would sing songs featuring words that were picked out at random, then new venue The Piano Works in Farringdon might seem vaguely familiar. Here two pianists and a band will play visitors’ favourite songs throughout the night, and to keep people going, cocktails and food will be available throughout the evening. It’s another large venue, accommodating up to 400 customers, and open until 1am each night. Taking advantage of the good weather, the London Marriott Hotel Grosvenor Square has launched a Pop-Up Picnic Bar in Grosvenor Square. Operational from July 6 to 26, it will see food and drink served from a converted Citroen camper van, alongside afternoon tea. Visitors will be able to dine either on picnic blankets or from deck chairs. Serving a European menu tinged with Argentine influences, Notting Hill ’s Casa Cruz invites diners to gather for drinks at an oval copper bar before dining on dishes such as charcoal-grilled monkfish, Argentine steaks and homemade ice creams. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Covent Garden ’s Moti Mahal Indian restaurant this month serves three new menus inspired by three famed Indian paintings (by Paresh Maity, Jayasri Burman and MF Husain). All will be on display in the restaurant for a limited time, and from July 10 to August 20, with different dishes on offer during that period dedicated to disparate artworks. A new London outpost from New York’s Hotel Chantelle, Hotel Chantelle London will serve playful French cuisine in an Orchard Street premises just off Oxford Street. Dishes on offer include waffle-crusted fried chicken with maple syrup cotton candy, a tuna tartare cigar served in a vintage glass ashtray, and Frosted Flake-encrusted stuffed French toast. From the sound of those dishes, it’s clearly not a place to visit if you’re making any attempt to eat healthily but proprietors promise a “relaxed yet sophisticated vibe” and late-night dining until 3am from Thursday to Saturday for those who fancy a sugar rush after a night out.
