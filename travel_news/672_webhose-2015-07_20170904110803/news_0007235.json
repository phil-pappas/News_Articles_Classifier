At 12 feet high and 8 feet across, \"Portal\" will have an exterior featuring wood slats covered in muraled plexiglass. There will be interactive lights on the outside, mirrors and LED lights inside. People will be able to walk through the structure, which will sit between16th and 17th streets. Organizers envision that the installation will become a place where people take selfies, have lunch or even hold a dance party. Social media will play a role in \"Portal,\" as organizers are looking for ways to coordinate the project's interactive lighting with social media hashtags. \"I think that Sacramento has struggled for a while to see itself as an innovator,\" said Tre Borden , the co-producer and program manager for \"Portal.\" Attitudes are shifting, thanks to a rising group of creative entrepreneurs, Borden said. He thinks \"Portal,\" which will be installed on R Street on Aug. 21, will reflect that change. \"Portal\" will cost $10,000 to build, according to Borden. Organizers received a $7,500 funding commitment from the Capitol Area Development Authority (CADA). Borden wants to raise at least $15,000 to cover programming and operational costs. \"We're really trying to reach out to businesses,\" he said. But aside from the potential for cool selfies, what's the point? \"Portal\" also will serve as a testing ground to collect feedback for new ideas. It might be a place to experiment with social activities such as a \"silent disco,\" a dance party where participants listen to music though headphones instead of traditional loudspeakers. Kim Garza of Quadriga Landscape Architecture is co-producer and head designer of the project, in which Quadriga is a partner. It is being constructed at locally Hacker Lab in midtown. \"Portal\" is expected to stay on R Street until mid-September, when it will move to TBD Fest, the art and music festival held in West Sacramento. What's next? That's still being decided, according to Borden. Ideally, he'd like Portal to travel through the region and maybe even become a \"cultural export\" that travels out of the area. \nWant Sacramento Travel   Sonya Sorich | Sacramento Business Journal Matt Porr of Hacker Lab works… more Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:55:55.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
