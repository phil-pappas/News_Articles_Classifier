If flying on a Blue fare, the cost to check the first bag ranges between $20 and $25 depending on when purchased, and a second bag costs $35. \nPassengers opting for Blue Plus fare will get one checked bag included and pay $35 for the second bag. Those on Blue Flex fares are allowed two free checked bags. \nAll additional checked bags will cost $100 each, JetBlue said. \n\"We have designed fare options to be simple and transparent for our customers,\" Marty St. George, JetBlue's executive vice president, commercial and planning, said in an email. \nJetBlue will still allow passengers to bring one carry-on bag and personal item on board for free. And fliers will continue to receive free snacks and soft drinks, DirecTV and SiriusXM Radio and broadband Internet access. \n\"Our research shows what's most important to our customers,\" St. George said. \"Fare options will allow us to continue to invest in what customers love most, like modern cabins with legroom and entertainment.\" \nSouthwest Airlines is now the only major U.S. carrier to still offer two free checked bags on domestic routes. \nIndustry analyst Seth Kaplan of Airline Weekly in Fort Lauderdale said JetBlue's changes put it in line with with most other airlines. And it could add up to higher profits, he said. \n\"[JetBlue's] checked bag fees are low compared to most other airlines,\" Kaplan said. \"Some customers — particularly heavy packers — won't love this. But overall, it makes sense for the airline and in some ways for passengers, too.\" \nThe changes apply for bookings made Tuesday or later. Travelers who booked airfare on JetBlue before June 30 will be allowed one checked bag free of charge, the carrier said. \nJetBlue initially announced plans for the new fare structure in November as part of several initiatives it said will boost revenue by more than $400 million annually starting in 2017. \nBeginning in mid-2016, JetBlue also plans to convert more of its Airbus A320 to its \"Cabin Refresh\" design, which uses lighter seating and will enable it to add 15 more seats for a total of 165, while still offering extra leg room in coach. \nThe retrofits will include larger seatback screens with more entertainment options and power ports, JetBlue has said. \nFor more information, go to jetblue.com/travel/our-fares/ \nasatchell@sunsentinel.com , 954-356-4209 or Twitter@TheSatchreport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:30:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
