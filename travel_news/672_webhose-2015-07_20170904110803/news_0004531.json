She asks: How can I make my business more energy efficient? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: Energy costs typically account for a huge proportion of a small or medium-sized business overheads. So finding ways for your business to become more energy-efficient not only helps preserve the world’s dwindling energy resources but also makes a great deal of financial sense. It can also help you promote your business and attract customers who like the idea of supporting a business that prioritises caring about energy use and the environment. Even the most simple actions can make a big difference. The Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates that the average SME could reduce its energy bill by 18pc to 25pc a year by installing energy efficiency measures with an average payback of less than 18 months. Start by switching off all equipment – computers, printers, scanners and so on – when you leave the office at night, and ask your staff to as well. Don’t just leave them on standby, because that still uses up energy. Ban screensavers – it is far more efficient to turn off computer monitors when they are not being used. Make sure that you have activated the energy-saving sleep-mode setting on all your electronic equipment in your offices – most computers, photocopiers, scanners and printers now come with them, but some need to be set manually. Ideally you want the sleep mode to activate after 15 minutes or less of inactivity. The energy-saving mode typically uses at least 70pc less energy than full-power mode. Think twice about printing out documents, because it is often not necessary, and wherever possible print on both sides. You should also unplug mobile phone and laptop chargers when they are not in use, even if they are not attached to a device, because they can still convert energy. You will be able to tell because it will get hot. Encourage staff to switch off lights in unoccupied areas – even better, install motion sensors in areas such as corridors and washrooms so that the lights automatically turn off when not needed. Turn the heating down. You don’t have to make people freeze – reducing the temperature by just 1C can cut your heating bills by 10pc. And keep the doors closed between heated and unheated areas – this could also significantly reduce your energy bills. Travel is another area where you can potentially become a lot more energy-efficient – consider using video conferencing instead of always travelling to meetings. Andrew Benfield, head of government programmes at the Energy Saving Trust, adds: With an increasing emphasis on rising energy prices, CO 2 legislation and consumers making ethical purchasing decisions, there are many compelling reasons why your organisation should focus on energy saving and sustainability. Energy Saving Trust is a big supporter of getting the cost-effective energy efficiency measures sorted in your home as a first priority, but the benefits for businesses are no less important. We advise growing businesses to not overlook travel as an important aspect of their energy consumption and fuel bills. A fifth of UK carbon emissions come from transport, and developing a sustainable travel policy can bring environmental benefits and cost savings. By reducing unnecessary journeys, choosing the most efficient vehicle available and then driving it as efficiently as you can you can reduce your business travel costs and emissions by up to 50pc. Electric vehicles are a great way to reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, and can actually be cheaper to run in the right circumstances. Many urban delivery firms are saving thousands of pounds a year by switching from diesel to electric vans. • One way to make your business financially and environmentally efficient is with the right company car, financed in the best way for your business.
