MARY, Mont. (AP) -- Cool weather and high humidity helped firefighters battling a fire that has burned about 5 square miles in Glacier National Park. But firefighters prepared for increased fire activity Tuesday as more seasonal weather returned to the area. The Reynolds Creek Fire was 45 percent contained by mid-day Tuesday after cloud cover and rain subdued the fire on Monday. The fire started on July 21 near St. Mary Lake. The cause is still under investigation. An 18-mile stretch of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, from the St. Mary Visitor Center and Big Bend, remained closed Tuesday. Park officials note a majority of the park remains open.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:09:04.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
