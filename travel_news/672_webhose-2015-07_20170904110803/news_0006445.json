Related content Unspeakable evil in Tunisia has sparked personal inner-conflict \nAll of the Britons who were killed in the beach massacre in Sousse were Thomson and First Choice customers. \nUK authorities have been working with their Tunisian counterparts since the beach massacre that claimed the lives of 30 Britons, including engineer Stephen Mellor, from Bodmin, Cornwall, whose wife Cheryl was severely injured in the attack. \nMrs Mellor told how her hand was ‘blown off’ after she was hit by bullets in the forearm and leg as her husband Stephen was shot, leaving him slumped motionless on the sand while trying to shield her. \nThe mother-of-two told of her horror as she saw her husband ‘die on the beach’ and that someone checked his pulse at the scene and said ‘he was gone.’ \nMany people from the Westcountry were caught up in the shootings, with some telling how they had to flee for their lives when the gunman struck. \nDaxi Zhan and his girlfriend Longmei Zhan, from Exeter, and Tony and Katryna Howes, from Penzance, were just a few of those who feared for their lives during the attack. \nMax Channon, of Plympton, writing in the Western Morning News earlier this week, told how he had booked a holiday to Tunisia, due in a few weeks’ time, but that he now feared for his family’s safety if the holiday went ahead. \nHe said: “Basically, I’ve booked a holiday, and now I’m having second thoughts because innocent people have been slaughtered on their sunbeds. \n“I guess that’s natural and understandable. \n“But my thoughts should be solely with the people who have died, and their families. \n“My concern should be for the people of a nation that relies on tourism and may inexorably slide further into the abyss of extremism if its economy crashes.” \nSpeaking of those who use terror tactics, he added: “At the end of the day, letting fear rule my thoughts and actions is what they, whoever they may be, want. They want to control me. They want to control us. \n“And if we let them do that to us, they have already won.” \nThomas Cook UK & Ireland has cancelled all future bookings to Tunisia up to the same date. A spokesman said it will be bringing all of its customers back to the UK “as soon as we can”. \nThe spokesman added: “The safety and well-being of our customers is our primary concern. As always, we have been closely following the advice from the FCO and local authorities to monitor the situation in Tunisia. In response to the recent change in FCO advice we have taken this decision to bring all Thomas Cook customers back to the UK as soon as we can using third party carriers and on our 10 scheduled flights over the weekend. \n“Thomas Cook is strongly advising its guests in the country to return on these flights. We are also sending our specialist assistance teams to Tunisia to offer customers additional support in resort. \n“We are committed to doing everything we can to support our guests in Tunisia at this time and will work to bring them back to the UK safely and as soon as possible.” \nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC: “While we do not have any information suggesting a specific or imminent threat, since the attack in Sousse the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably leading us to the view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.” \nDespite increased security since the shootings, the Government has said the extra measures did not go far enough. \nIn updated travel advice, the Foreign Office said: “Since the attack in Sousse, we have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups in Tunisia. \n“Although we have had good co-operation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely. \n“On balance, we do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time and we have therefore changed our travel advice accordingly.” \nHolidaymakers should contact their tour operators about returning to Britain and independent travellers should make their own arrangements to leave, the FCO said. \nBetween 2,500-3,000 British tourists are believed to be in Tunisia and around 300 independent travellers. \nThe Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) urged people due to travel to Tunisia to contact the company they booked through. \nIt said: “For anyone due to travel, you should be aware that travelling out to Tunisia at this time is likely to invalidate your travel insurance policies. Most insurance policies will still provide cover for travellers in a country at the time of Foreign Office advice change. \n“Those with holidays booked within the next 48 hours to Tunisia are advised to contact your travel company to discuss available options. If you have booked a package you will be entitled to a refund or alternative holiday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T22:29:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
