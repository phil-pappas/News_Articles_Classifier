Practically annihilated by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane (still considered the strongest to reach landfall in the United States), this “Village of Islands” became known for quality sport fishing, attracting professional and amateur anglers from around the world.\nOn the artistic front, Islamorada was a sleeper of an area for years because serious art lovers often headed toward the galleries at Key West. But recently, a spate of galleries and working studios set up by islanders and transplants has highlighted a growing community of artists whose voice is defined predominantly by local marine life.\nMany artists were inspired by the success of monthly bazaar-style art walks started by a nonprofit called Morada Way Arts and Cultural District founded in 2011 by three longtime residents, Dick Hagood, Pasta Pantaleo and Laurie Wickham, who created a downtown “arts district.” This tranquil stretch of a few blocks off U.S. Route 1 (81.2 miles from Miami) is flanked by houses painted in tropical colors of pale blue, pink and green.\nPhoto William Purser works in glass, his medium, at the Rain Barrel, a village of artisans.

As the night wore on, you had to practically elbow through the crowds to watch the painters and hear a band that was playing nearby.\n“Artists who had no gallery space found that they finally had a venue to show their work and meet collectors,” said Betsy Keteltas, former executive director of the arts and cultural district. From a trickle of a few hundred visitors when they started, the walks now attract thousands each month.\nSoon, artists began setting up storefronts in the area. The acrylics painter BJ Royster opened her eponymous gallery a year and a half ago opposite the arts district, where she sells nautical-style jewelry and large photorealism paintings focusing on the area’s coral reefs, dolphins and aquatic life like the queen angelfish and trunkfish. Next door, a former Angeleno, Stephanie Martin, started Seaside Glassworks in December 2012 to showcase her fused glass creations. On any given day, patrons are drawn to shimmering trays of ocean-inspired pendants as well as lamps designed with the Keys’ color palette of aquamarine, brilliant red and pale yellow. She also creates custom glass pet portraits that are both cheeky and nostalgic from photographs.\nPhoto Islamorada in the Upper Florida Keys has a history of reinventing itself.

It was once the studio of the late ceramist and Islamorada mayor Ron Levy, and was transformed by two New Mexico transplants, Erich and Samantha Decker-Hoppen as well as a local, Frank Shaw. The co-op-style space is frequented by snowbirds and area residents alike. Monthly dues of $200 cover a space to work as well as a place to stash materials. The place also offers access to mentors.\nThe growing arts scene has been a boon to other businesses. The restaurant Chef Michael’s opened a few years ago in the downtown area and its coral-hued walls are studded with local art. A block away at the Florida Keys Brewing Company, which opened its doors in January, visitors can drink locally brewed Flakeys Key Lime Witbier while gazing at a Zen wavelike mural by Mr. Pantaleo, one of the local founders of the arts district.\nRising real estate prices have driven a few artists a few miles farther north, where they have set up roomier quarters in an area formerly filled with offices. The sculptors Dwayne and Cindy King opened their Old Road Gallery there in November. The gallery brims with whimsical bronze, clay and copper sculptures like one of a cat smoking a pipe. A nature garden with mahogany, hardwood hammock, gumbo limbo trees and other indigenous plants creates a serene setting, attracting migratory birds as a bonus.\nHotels, too, are embracing the art movement. One local, the marine biologist-turned-painter Guy Harvey, licensed his Outpost brand to the nearby Islander Resort; the brand’s message, “from oceans comes life,” echoes throughout the property with digital and graphic reproductions of his marlin-inspired artwork.\nAlso on the resort grounds is the Florida Keys Discovery Center, which opened in January 2014. The museum displays the area’s history through interactive exhibits, photographs, guest lectures and videos. “The response has been terrific,” said Jill Miranda Baker, the center’s executive director. “There is so much more going on here than meets the eye.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05HEADS2/05HEADS2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.bjroyster.com/", "http://www.seasideglassworks.com/", "http://www.keysdiscovery.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05HEADS4/05HEADS4-articleLarge.jpg", "http://guyharveyoutpostislamorada.com/", "http://www.oldroadgallery.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05HEADS2/05HEADS2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://moradaway.org/moradawayclay/", "http://moradaway.org/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/05/travel/05HEADS4/05HEADS4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.floridakeysbrewingco.com/", "http://foodtotalkabout.com/"], "published": "2015-07-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:14:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
