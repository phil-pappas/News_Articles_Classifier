The sugar maple, in particular, is so vivid and brilliant it makes everything light up.” The secret to the spectacular autumn colours of Cape Cod, and Massachusetts more generally, is warm weather followed by a sharp frost, she adds. But there is more to the state’s gardens than autumn tones, stunning though they are. Three main factors influence their design: the often acidic soil, winter snows and the abundance of rock. The first means spectacular displays of rhododendrons (and hydrangeas), as well as an abundance of plants such as inkberry and American hollies. The second means a love of evergreen trees, chosen specifically for their shape so snow-laden branches look dramatic. “The dwarf Alberta spruce gives a lovely regular shape while the Hinoki cypress looks more windblown,” says Fornari. “Dwarf white pines are popular for their long needles.” But for Fornari it is the geology, mainly slates and granites, that make Massachusetts gardens distinctive. “Rocks and boulders give a sense of place. They also give a solid contrast to leaves,” she says. “Most gardeners here go for a rustic look, but well tended. So you’ll find split-rail or picket fences that are allowed to age naturally, and a real mix of evergreens, flowering perennials and ornamental grasses, with some annuals sprinkled here and there.” Her great mantra about planting is to “think puddles, not polka-dots or pairs”; in other words, aim for natural, organic shapes. Rocks and boulders give a solid contrast to leaves. If you have a variety of textures and colours in the foliage you’ve always got something going on She recommends Physocarpus , the ninebark shrub, with its deep purple or copper leaves, Deutzia gracilis \"Chardonnay Pearls\", with its lime-green leaves and tiny white flowers, or the sea-blue foliage of Fothergilla x intermedia \"Blue Shadow\". Her own garden, delightfully named Poison Ivy Acres, is two-and-a-half acres of what she terms “a real plant-geek’s” domain. It has a range of sections, including a “hell strip” next to the road “where it’s hot and dry, so I plant things that don’t need regular watering”. Next is her “cuttings garden”, a test bed for cuttings and seedlings where “I stick things and see what happens”. Immediately in front of the house is the “entry garden”, a rich flower display of perennials and annuals. Elsewhere there is a large vegetable garden and the wonderfully named “cocktail hour garden”, where “we sit in the evenings with our drinks”. The latter surrounds the decking at the rear of the house and is planted with flowers and shrubs to either catch the setting sun, sparkle in the twilight, attract hummingbirds or give off a lovely scent. We are unlikely to find hummingbirds flitting around our evening gardens in the UK, but Fornari recommends the hummingbird mint ( Agastache ‘Blue Fortune’) – or giant hyssop, to give it the British common name. It is a sturdy upright perennial, with lavender-blue spikes of flowers that “kind of glow in the evenings”. She also suggests Cyperus papyrus \"King Tut\" papyrus for a container plant. “It’s a tall papyrus with fine green threads that catch the setting sun. It looks like a firework that has come to life.” Like many keen gardeners, Fornari opens her garden for several days throughout the year, donating the small entrance fee to local charities. This year it will be open for several days in July as part of the Cape Cod Hydrangea Festival, and again in September. gardenlady.com For more information on USA holidays and gardens visit discoveramerica.com You may also be interested in: • USA garden at RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show • Five of the best cycle routes in the USA » • Outdoor leisure pursuits for families in the USA » • Three classic food-themed road trips in the USA » • Special deals and free attractions in New York City »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:37:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
