A 12-year-old girl became the victim of the offence when topless pictures of her were posted on Facebook after splitting up with her partner. The girl's friend told her parents and the matter was reported to Cheshire Police and social services. In another case, a 13-year-old girl discovered an image of her topless, and another of her in underwear, were used to set up a fake Facebook profile in her name. The images were shared with another offender who then sent bogus friend requests to the girl's friends. However, the victim did not support police action against the suspect. • Revenge porn: New offence comes into force • Google to block revenge porn from search results The same force reported another teenager, a 19-year-old woman, who discovered images of her getting out of the bath following the breakdown of her relationship with her boyfriend.

He also made regular abusive contact with his ex, via WhatsApp and through phone calls. A teenage boy, whose age was not supplied by Hertfordshire Police, told his former girlfriend's friends he had nude photographs of his ex and would publish them online if she did not do as he wanted. He had been making daily contact with his ex and her friends, trying to get information about her whereabouts. The victim did not give her consent to the images being taken and only discovered their existence when the ex-boyfriend sent her a screenshot.
