Its symbolic motifs feature elements from nature. Roosters stand for rebirth; birds for harmony; a floral bouquet symbolizes the tree of life.\nPetrykivka art began as ornamentation on adobe whitewashed walls, furniture and other objects. Only a few examples predating the 19th century remain in museum collections.\nPetryivka is on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:02:28.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
