If you want to get a fix of art in London, the Tate or the National Portrait Gallery will immediately spring to mind. But the ever-changing street art around east London is wooing a whole new audience who might never have set foot in a traditional gallery. The spray can was once regarded as a tool to disfigure our streets. But it has now become the means of creating a gritty, dynamic form of art. In the more edgy, artsy parts of town, the works of street artists adorn many buildings. On walls and doors, roofs and street furniture, everything from full-blown murals to subtle stencil outlines liven up the urban setting. And heading the list of artists who have forged their reputation in this style of art is Banksy. The elusive graffiti artist has become a household name with his array of provocative and humorous images. His work has helped make Brick Lane the unofficial cultural capital of street art in London. It’s now a “must-see” area for street art fans, along with parts of New York, Berlin and Paris. Street art is a constantly evolving scene, new ones can appear on walls literally overnight So if you live in London, just take the tube to Shoreditch High Street and get started. If not, be sure to mark off a few hours on your next trip to the capital to immerse yourself in the street art. Of course, you can simply wander along the streets of Tower Hamlets, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel and Shoreditch for free. But if you want to find out more about the street art, you can take an organised walking tour. Experienced tour guides will invariably know the best places to go. They will be able to tell you the stories behind some of the better-known works, as well as the background of the street artists. Particularly well-informed guides will be able to take you to the latest art works. Because street art is a constantly evolving scene, new ones can appear on walls literally overnight, while others can be just as quickly covered over and lost forever. That’s because artists want to refresh their own portfolio – or because local councils aren’t happy with their streets being spray-painted. Walking tours usually last between one or two hours, and can be thirsty work. So don’t forget as you gaze up or look down at the art, to make a mental note of some of the most inviting bars, pubs, cafes and restaurants in this famously vibrant part of the city. Because of course, once you’ve feasted your eyes on all this colourful street art, it’s time to feed your stomach, too.
