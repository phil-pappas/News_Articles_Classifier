The park is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. Bob Lang, Provided by Balboa Park Summary \nA century ago, the world came to the small town of San Diego to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal at the Panama-California Exposition. The venue, Balboa Park, would grow into one of the biggest urban cultural parks in North America. \nSAN DIEGO — A century ago, the world came to San Diego, a city many didn't know existed, for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal. \nSan Diego, today the eighth-largest city in the United States, was Lilliputian with a population of roughly 32,000. Both San Francisco and Los Angeles had a few hundred thousand citizens each; San Francisco was even hosting a competing expo, the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. \nBut on July 9, 1909, prominent San Diego banker G. Aubrey Davidson suggested his city, a toddling beach community located in the big toe of the Golden State, host an exhibition to celebrate the human-made marvel’s opening. If the event made the city a household name and helped it bounce back from the economic Panic of 1907, so much the better. \nRight on schedule, New Year’s Day 1915, the Panama-California Exposition in the newly named Balboa Park welcomed the world. While the expo has vanished into the ether, the park remains. The San Diego Tourism Authority calls Balboa Park the \"Smithsonian of the West\" and the \"largest urban cultural park in North America,\" saying the park's size of almost 1,200 acres exceeds that of Central Park. \nIt is fitting that Balboa Park is the guest of honor as the city celebrates the expo’s centennial. A good place to start a visit is the Marston House Museum and Gardens , former home of one-time San Diego department store owner and philanthropist George W. Marston. Marston donated much of the land that became Balboa Park. The house, built in 1905, draws visitors every year as a prime example of the Arts and Crafts architectural style. \nThis year’s visitors to the Marston House can help themselves to a sample of life in 1915. Commemorative pillows, plates, purses and other souvenirs that fairgoers took home from the expo, including oddities such as a genuine miner’s ore bag, have been dusted off and are on display. A posted advertisement by the Santa Fe Railroad tells readers about scary events going on in the outside world: “Open on time: War will not affect the 1915 Panama Expositions.” The conflict that would become known as the Great War was setting Europe ablaze. \nThe next step is to visit the San Diego History Center . In the yearlong special exhibit “San Diego Invites the World: The 1915 Expo,” descriptions of the fair give 21st-century visitors the opportunity to decide what they would see and do if they were walking the grounds 100 years ago. \nThen again, many did not walk the grounds. Some chose to traverse the fair by way of an electriquette. Few pedestrians could wander the property without seeing these wicker-covered electric-powered vehicles that could move at 3.5 miles per hour. Based on similar electric carts that had transported Boardwalk denizens of Atlantic City, New Jersey, for several years, electriquettes proved as hot an item as ice cream cones in August. One display says that by August 1915, the fleet of electriquettes had logged 143,000 miles. \nNext up is the Botanical Building , which dazzles with a reflection pond called Laguna de Las Flores, or “the flower lagoon.” The California Quadrangle was dominated by a bell tower of Spanish design and became the 1915 fair’s symbol. One could sip oolong tea at the Japanese Tea House and sample baked goods at the Foreign and Domestic Industries building. Additionally, the works of American painter Robert Henri dominated a small but potent display of contemporary art that afforded a teasing look at the future Ashcan school of art.
