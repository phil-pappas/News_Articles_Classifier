So Snooty was moved around a bit, and in 1949 came to live at the South Florida Museum in Bradenton, Florida -- where his big, gentle, extremely-whiskered self has been a celebrated species ambassador ever since. \nSnooty was but a boy, being fed by a boy, in 1976. Photo: State Archives of Florida \nAccording to National Geographic, the average lifespan of manatees in the wild is about 40 years. Other groups, like the Save the Manatee Club, put that figure a decade lower . \nSo how did Snooty reach his impressively advanced age? \nMartha Wells, development director at the South Florida Museum, said by email that his twice-yearly comprehensive veterinary checkups have probably helped. Not being around the boats or environmental hazards that kill so many of his wild compatriots is another factor. \nSnooty's also on a strict diet: Every day, he is fed some 70 pounds of romaine lettuce, plus another 10 pounds of kale, broccoli, carrots and other vegetables. He has a sweet tooth, but only gets the occasional strawberry or pineapple, to keep him at a svelte and healthy 1,020 pounds. \nFor all the years he's lived, Snooty has never mated. In fact, aside from the occasional manatee who's been hit by a boat or otherwise injured and is sharing his pool during rehab, Snooty is usually swimming solo. \nSince the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the only manatees in captivity are \"for rehabilitation or because they have permanent injuries that would preclude their survival in the wild. Manatees aren't kept for just display or bred for display in the U.S.,\" explained Katie Tripp, director of science and conservation for Save the Manatee Club . \nSnooty is among those who predate the act, and \"are not subject to its restrictions, but have been in captivity so long they are not good candidates for release anyway,\" Tripp said. \nSouth Florida Museum spokeswoman Jessica Schubick says that Snooty enjoys himself when he has convalescing manatee guests -- as he does now -- or when he does not. \n\"He's definitely more interested in people than other manatees,\" Schubick said. \"He doesn't really seem to form bonds with other manatees, but doesn't seem to mind them. He really likes people.\" \nSchubick said a nice birthday gift for Snooty would be to come and visit him in person for his 67th birthday party -- being held at the museum on July 18 -- since Snooty loves being fussed over by admirers. \n\"He does seem to have an interest in cameras,\" she said. \nSnooty says hello! \nPosted by South Florida Museum on Tuesday, April 1, 2014 \nWells said Snooty has taught the world a lot about his kind over these unusually many years. Some facts you might not know: These gentle giants have individual personalities, they keep growing new teeth even as adults, they have excellent hearing, and they are communicative and intelligent. \nPerhaps most importantly, Wells said, because of Snooty, we now know \"that it is possible for a manatee to live 67 years.\" \nIt's almost summer and that means road trips! Snooty wants to know: If you got in your car right now - how long would it take you to get here? #traveltuesdayPhoto credit: http://ow.ly/N9Sjs \nGet in touch at arin.greenwood@huffingtonpost.com if you have an animal story to share!

And Margarito once followed a specialist investigating a deceased manatee, and stayed with him the entire time. Annie is an endangered West Indian manatee at Blue Spring State Park. She was rescued from the Halifax River near Port Orange, Florida. While rehabilitating at SeaWorld, Annie met another orphaned calf, Rocket. The two have been inseparable ever since. As Wayne Hartley, the Club's Manatee Specialist, put it: \"Annie loves people, and Rocket loves Annie.\" Howie is notorious for his antics at Blue Spring State Park. He reportedly once knocked into a canoe of researchers dumping the people and their equipment. Now, whenever he sees a canoe, he bolts and issues a distress call, according to caretakers. Georgia, who spends her winters in Blue Spring State Park, has had a tough life. As an orphan, she was released into the wild after rebailitaion with fellow manateee Clover, who was supposed to show her how to find food, etc. But Clover soon went rogue and left Georgia on her own. Caretakers also say Georgia's tag sunk underwater, showing puncture signs of a large alligator bite. Despite her woes, Georgia is a character; she once gave a gentle nudge to a swimmer trying to climb a dock ladder and she once swam around with someone's jeans in her mouth. Ariel is an endangered West Indian manatee rescued from Lake Worth, rehabilitated at the Miami Seaquarium, and now lives at Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. Caretakers say Ariel to a bit too hefty at 2,500, nearly twice the size of an average female mantee. They are trying to help her shed some pounds. Ariel is described as curious, lifting her head out of the water to hear conversations, and playful. She once pushed around a shoe of a park visitor that had fallen into the water. Betsy is Ariel's sister and shows a similar appetite for life. Caretakers say she holds out on carrots to wait for tastier cookie-like vitamin treats. She also reportedly \"smiles\" at rangers just like her mother Amanda. According to caretakers, Brutus likes to sleep in, often missing the early morning roll call. Once wake, he's quite social and shows a certain affinity for the female manatees. Deep Dent is an endangered West Indian manatee at Blue Spring State Park with a \"dent-link\" scar from a propeller wound on his head. A tad on the shy side, Deep Dent is also known for his wanderlust. Doc has his winter home at Blue Spring State Park. He's something of a ladies manatee, caretakers reports, often coupling with fellow adoptee Phyllis although he's also been spotted with Dana, Lily, and Lucille. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Caretakers also say he's protective of manatee recovering from injuries. At home in Blue Spring State Park, Elaine sadly lost two brothers to boat injuries and her mother Emma to unknown causes. She also lost a calf to a boat but now has 4 known calves and 8 grand-calves. Elsie is known by the nickname 'Fingers' because her tail was mangle in a boat accident and now resembles a human hand. She has five known calves. Flash is one of the first manatees to arrive at Blue Springs State Park for the winter. He earned his name, caretakers say, because he is quick to startle and will swim away \"in a flash\" if disturbed. This manatee got her name due to the scars on her back that resemble a flickering candle. Floyd only has half a tail after a boat strike. Caretakers note he is playful; he sometimes gives researchers a little nudge from behind, pushing them out of the water. He even nudges himself into other manatees in front of cameras. Lily, who makes her winter home at Blue Spring State Park, often nurses orphaned calves. She even became a foster mother to a cold-stressed young calf named Foster. Lorelei was the first manatee ever born and bred in captivity. She was born at the Miami Seaquarium to parents Romeo and Juliet. She reportedly does tricks like barrel rolls when accepting nutritional treats. Robin is the son of a manatee named Wonder Woman, and he shows some superhero-like courage as well. Caretakers report that when a group of manatees was startled by a loud noise, Robin could be seen calm in the middle of them, working his way back upstream. Rosie is a big manatee, weighing 2,500 pounds. Nicknamed \"the babysitter\" of Homosassa Springs, she is known for being gentle, kind, and maternal. She is also known for hogging the \"Manatee Salad Bar,\" where the park's manatees feed. Squeaky was just born in 2011, and still stays close to mom Amber. Researchers once caught Squeaky trying to scratch her belly on the bottom of a canoe. Vector got his name because of the large triangular-shaped scar on the right side of his body. He spends his winters cozied up in waters near Tampa Bay's Tampa Electric power plant.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T00:18:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
