I’ve been celebrating. I’ve become what French, I’m told – and I’m prepared to believe it – call a sexygénaire. • Emma Soames: in praise of turning 60 Big birthdays aren’t something I’ve made much of before; but I’ve laid on a number of events to mark this one. It started with my (self-awarded) birthday treat: visiting the Royal Opera House to see Wagner’s Der Fliegender Höllander – The Flying Dutchman. I see it as very much relevant to my own case, now that I’ve acquired a Freedom Pass. I look forward to storm-tossed adventures on the 24 bus. I may achieve a lifetime’s ambition and get to the end of the Victoria Line. The Royal Opera House at dawn (Loop images) The day itself caused some discussion. We mooted Paris. We went several times when the children were little, rejoicing in the civilised rule that prevails in the City of Light: parents with pushchairs are allowed to the front of the queue. Although I managed to find excuses to return for work purposes, later visits haven’t been made en famille. • Is graffiti ruining Paris? Even in the depths of an economic recession, Paris remains the most dazzling of European capitals; London is now infinitely more exciting by almost any measure, but will never exceed it as a self-conscious work of art. And Paris has something which I dearly wanted to revisit: a yearly agricultural show. That may, perhaps, not sound that much fun to anybody who hasn’t been to the Salon International de l’Agriculture but remember this is France, whose national identity is built around a myth of rural life and the food it produces. Francis Hollande stops to admire a cow at one Paris agriculture show (Reuters) In this country, the Royal Show has collapsed, but SIA goes on – three times the size, at the gates of the capital, an exuberant festival of regionalism, agricultural produce, Nature and field sports. Paris had to be rejected on grounds of cost. The hotel we’d wanted to stay in wouldn’t allow three teenagers to share a single room; I didn’t want to pay for three rooms. • Paris after the padlocks Fortunately, there’s another City of Light in our lives – Ramsgate: on the other side of the Wantsum Channel (the watercourse, once broad, that still officially divides the Isle of Thanet from the rest of the South-East) rather than the English Channel. We have a little house there, where – when it’s my call – we watch black and white films, bicycle beside the famous Ramsgate sands, and eat stupendously. • Can I retire at 60 on £20,000 a year? We did more eating than bicycling on this occasion, due to the weather, although exercise was not entirely off the agenda. I’d forgotten about a delivery of logs I had ordered some time before. A couple of cubic metres of logs doesn’t sound very much, when discussed over a telephone. They turn out to be an enormous volume when delivered during a birthday lunch. Ramsgate sands back in the day (Hulton Archive) By forming a human chain, we managed to bring them from the pavement into the house between the fish pie (my favourite) and pudding. We were so warm by the end of it that we had no need of lighting a fire. I should explain that my birthday fell on a Sunday. That was good: Sunday is a family day, not one for throwing a big party. And we wanted to hold a party. The options, in terms of finding an interesting space that you can hire in London, aren’t extensive and none of them seems to be cheap. • Sex and the 60 year old Besides, we only began to think about this around New Year – and really, I now see, a big party takes months to think about, organise, and probably even longer to pay for. We decided to have 50 friends to dinner at a club. Since the club is closed at weekends, that confirmed our preference for a weekday event. • Many hoppy returns: Miffy turns 60 The Garrick Club seemed the natural choice. Mardi Gras in New Orleans (Alamy) When we started the exercise, 50 seemed an astonishing, extravagant number. One of the nice things about getting to 60 was to find that it wasn’t. We wanted to invite friends from all the stages of my life, some of whom we haven’t seen for a while. • Typical pension pot of 60 year old is £10,600 Over the many decades, I’m lucky enough to have developed a fabulous acquaintance of adorable people – and we had to be ruthlessly selective. In one way that was a pity. In another way, it meant that the evening had a more intimate character than might have been the case for a Hindu wedding scale of do. The Garrick Club (Geoff Pugh) My brothers and their families came on Sunday, the one after the birthday itself. We couldn’t have them at the Garrick beano, they would have filled the available space. But in any case, home and family go together. Preparation was easy. It principally involved buying the largest joint of beef in the world and serving it in an atmosphere of bibulous hilarity. The combined effect of the beef, the Yorkshires, the pudding and possibly the wine was that somebody (me, I think) broke one of the chairs. • The perils of the gentleman's club It was a small sacrifice for a day of rejoicing. There have got to be exceptions for birthdays. I won’t be 60 again.
