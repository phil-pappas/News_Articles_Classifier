It's so 2014. Now major galleries and museums and sports arenas around the globe have called \"time\" on this wand of Satan. \nIn South Korea, the government has implemented huge fines for retailers selling uncertified selfie sticks. It shows, if nothing else, just how quickly trends in travel can come and go. \nA woman takes a selfie at Royal Ascot. Photo: Reuters. \nThere are other trends that have staying power. Our smartphones, which already turn us into travel agents and photographic wizards and put maps, guidebooks and foreign phrasebooks in our hands, will bring us cheaper methods to keep in touch. Ingenious souls, meanwhile, have worked out ways to parlay this connectivity into a more intimate view of the world, offering us a chance to sit down for a family meal in a home in Mexico City or Mumbai. \nThere are new kinds of hotels for travellers who want chic and basic at a knockdown price, and some hotel rooms you won't even need a key or a card to enter. The savvy traveller also has new ways to score an upgrade without breaking the bank, or shoot for the stars if your pockets are deep enough. Here are the trends shaping (for good and bad) travel in 2015. \nTHE TREND: Off the eaten path \nTHE LOWDOWN: In some countries, your waiter will probably go home to a more interesting meal than what he brings to your table – India take note. Home is often where the gastro stars rule in the kitchen, and there are now several websites that put you in touch with locals for a home-cooked family meal. It's cultural as well as culinary, a window on domestic life that tourists rarely get to see. Travelling Spoon ( www.travelingspoon.com ) takes you into the family dining room to experience home cooking in 16 Asian countries. Eat With ( www.eatwith.com ) and Feastly ( www.eatfeastly.com ) extend the home-diner experience in other parts of the globe while Home Food ( www.homefood.it ) admits you to to the kitchens of Italy for regional food that will have your taste buds singing an aria. \nEXPERT TIP: It's a great ice breaker if you bring a little something for the host. Flowers or chocs are ideal but alcohol might offend. \nTHE TREND: Connected in the clouds Ad Feedback \nWifi on an American Airlines flight. Photo: Reuters. \nTHE LOWDOWN: The ability to connect to on-board WiFi and check and send emails, log into Facebook and Instagram that pic of the clouds you just shot is the next must-have for full-service airlines. Among the international airlines that service Australia, Singapore Airlines, Etihad, Emirates, JAL, Garuda and United offer WiFi on most of their flights. \nEXPERT TIP: Read the fine print before you sign on to an onboard pay-as-you-go internet service, the charges per MB can be astronomical. \nTHE TREND: Posh digs without the pricetag \nTHE LOWDOWN: These are the beds of choice for the flashpacker, the uber-backpacker looking to travel with comfort but not too many frills, and with deeper pockets and probably a few more candles on the birthday cake. The poshtel comes with double rooms rather than dorms, free WiFi, and a communal kitchen with an espresso machine a high probability. Originality is key.

Photo: Ben Blankenburg. \nTHE LOWDOWN: For the middle-aged urban male, cycling is the new golf, and they're packing their passion when they take a holiday as well, signing up for week-long cycle tours through Sicily and Provence and even tackling a stage of the Tour de France. The booming demand means a huge choice of scenarios, from self-guided trips in two-star accommodation to escorted tours with boutique accommodation and Michelin star meals. Golf holidays, meanwhile, are on the downturn. \nEXPERT TIP: Doubts about your pedal power? A guided group tour with a sag wagon as backup is the way to go. \nTHE TREND: One for the converts \nTHE TREND: I feel better now \nWellness vacays are so hot right now. \nTHE LOWDOWN: As waistlines and unhealthy lifestyles bloom and the work/life balance goes ever more crazily out of kilter, the wellness vacation becomes the magic wand to put things right. This is a holiday with a brand new you at the end of it. At the top end are luxury retreats set in a tropical part of the planet attended by Ayurvedic doctors and masseurs trained in esoteric therapies that may involve Buddhist chanting. Mealtimes bring spa cuisine of such ethereal beauty that eating them becomes a criminal offence. \nEXPERT TIP: Be clear about what changes you want to make, and stick to the programme. \nTHE TREND: We have liftoff \nTHE LOWDOWN: Looking to a wind back the clock with a nip and tuck, or maybe a complete hip replacement? Many people are now heading overseas for medical treatments, particularly for cosmetic, dental and elective surgery. The lure is resort-like facilities, well-trained medical staff, prices just a fraction of the same treatment at home and – for those with ready cash – no wait list. In our region, Thailand is a world leader, Singapore and India are not too far behind. \nEXPERT TIP: Look carefully before you make any surgical leaps, and check your travel insurance policy. \nTHE TREND: Key findings \nTHE LOWDOWN: Those electronic cards that you swipe or insert to open your hotel room door are heading the way of the room key, at least according to some major industry players. Guests can now enter thousands of rooms at Starwood hotels using an app on their smartphone. Hilton and Marriott are gearing up to join the charge. Guests register for keyless entry, download the app and they're good to go. When the room is ready, the number is relayed to your phone. \nEXPERT TIP: Time to buy a backup smartphone battery? \nTHE TREND: The big squeeze \nTHE LOWDOWN: As seating becomes ever more exotic and refined in the golden uplands of business and first class, economy passengers face an ever bigger squeeze. In terms of width and leg room, economy seats on budget carriers are as tight as they can possibly be without causing impacted hip and knee joints, not to mention passengers' ability to evacuate a stricken aircraft. Airbus has filed a patent for a fold-down, bicycle-type saddle seat with a tiny back and arm rests. Be afraid. \nEconomy seats are getting smaller and smaller. Ew. Photo: 123rf.com. \nEXPERT TIP: Practise shallow breathing since a full inhalation may inconvenience the passenger sitting next to you. \nTHE TREND: Tours de force \nTHE LOWDOWN: Rather than off-the-shelf tours that show you only the postcard highlights, tour operators are looking to build authenticity. Trafalgar offers Be My Guest, a home-cooked family meal, which might take you into a chateau in France or a California winery or Cultural Insights; a backstage look few outsiders are ever privileged to have. Insight Vacations offers Signature Events – dining, hotels and experiences out of reach of the average independent traveller. \nEXPERT TIP: This could swing the balance the other way for tour-averse travellers. \nTHE TREND: Off again, on again \nTHE LOWDOWN: After years of insisting that using personal electronic devices (PEDs) such as tablets and even e-readers at altitudes below 10,000 feet could interfere with flight systems, most major airlines now allow their uninterrupted use from \"gate-to-gate\". This follows a US Federal Aviation Administration report, which found that interference from PEDs does not threaten the safety of commercial airliners. There's a caveat in that all PEDs must be in non-transmitting mode. \nEXPERT TIP: Don't forget your USB charge cord. \nTHE TREND: Upping \nTHE LOWDOWN: As flight time approaches, quite a few airlines with empty seats in premium economy and business class now allow you to upgrade at a big discount. Included in the list are Etihad, Virgin, Thai, Malaysia Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Ask at the check-in desk, and be prepared to hand over your credit card. Qantas has recently introduced Bid Now Upgrades, which allows passengers on selected flights to upgrade using a mix of Qantas Frequent Flyer points and cash. This is similar to Virgin Australia's UpgradeMe Premium Bid system. Optiontown sells unsold premium seats aboard a few international carriers at a big discount. \nYou can now upgrade at check-in. \nEXPERT TIP: Fly in a quiet time and you'll up your chances. \nTHE TREND: Coming of the Drone \nTHE LOWDOWN: The hottest travel accessory, camera-equipped drones are being used by intrepid travellers to record their exploits as they raft rapids, ski down pine-clad slopes, climb vertiginous alpine peaks and pedal through the vineyards of Chianti. The results are phenomenal. The photographer becomes the subject of their own documentary, every finger-tearing handhold, every near-death escape chronicled in lavish colour. \nEXPERT TIP: Check the Hexo+ fully autonomous camera-equipped drone and start dreaming. \nAbout the writer When Michael \"The Tripologist\" Gebicki started travelling, the inflight entertainment was projected onto a pull-down screen and the only reason you might call home from a holiday would be to relay a ransom demand. It's been a wild ride since.
