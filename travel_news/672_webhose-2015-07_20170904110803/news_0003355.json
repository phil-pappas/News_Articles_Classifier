Tears filled my eyes. I was caught off guard, a little embarrassed at my reaction.\nThis was supposed to be a lighthearted afternoon in Little Rock touring the nation’s only museum dedicated to purses. Yes, purses. But there in one bright display case was a red pocketbook identical to the one that my grandma last carried, shiny vinyl with a sturdy gold clasp and an equally sturdy handle. Immediately I saw that purse on my grandmother’s arm. The tears spilled over as I remembered digging in Grandma’s purse for gum and other treats.\nI was not alone in my emotions, according to Anita Davis, founder of the museum.\n“It’s not at all unusual to have men and women leave here with tears in their eyes and smiles on their faces from similar memories these purses have triggered,” says Davis, who has been collecting purses for more than 25 years.\nShe named her museum Esse, referring to the essence of a woman. From a pricey Chanel clutch to a Baylor University football purse, the collection includes about 3,500 examples of the things women have used to carry their stuff.\nStarting with the 1900s, the exhibit is a timeline of women’s rights and their growth as individuals.\nWhen women were not allowed to work or own property, when men handled all matters for them, they had no need to carry money, keys or anything else.\nBy the time women were carrying things like cellphones and pepper spray, the container had evolved to a handbag, a shoulder bag or a backpack.\nFrom times of war and the Great Depression to the psychedelic colors of the 1960s, the purse museum documents the American experience as half of our population lived it for more than 100 years.\nEsse is also a retail outlet carrying designer handbags, as well as some jewelry. More than two dozen designers from around the world have work for sale here.\nDiana Lambdin Meyer is a Missouri freelance writer.\nWhen you go The Esse Purse Museum is at 1510 S. Main St. in Little Rock. Admission is $10; closed Mondays. essepursemuseum.org .
