Jumeirah Frankfurt is the perfect destination for a luxurious and tranquil escape. The spa offers two saunas, dedicated relaxation areas and treatment rooms enabling guests to experience Aromatherapy Associates famed therapeutic treatments. \nDoris Greif, General Manager of Jumeirah Frankfurt and Regional Vice-President of Jumeirah Europe, said: “We are excited to announce our collaboration with Aromatherapy Associates at the Talise Spa at Jumeirah Frankfurt. With a variety of renowned spa treatments on offer using beautifully scented products from Aromatherapy Associates, the Talise Spa offers high quality, tailor-made aromatherapy spa experiences to suit every luxury traveller.” Treatments on offer include the anti-ageing antidote ‘Rose Infinity Facial’ which combines the most advanced natural ingredients with cutting edge technology to reveal younger looking skin and a radiant complexion. Made from a formula of Alpine Rose stem cells and highly acclaimed hydrolysed yeast proteins, the active ingredients promote protection and skin regeneration, by naturally re-surfacing and illuminating the complexion to give the effect of a non-surgical facelift. The treatment offers instantly visible results; noticeably toned, firmer skin, reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, while a bespoke massage stimulates circulation and melts away stress or tension. For men ‘The Refinery Essential Facial’ is suitable for all skin types, but particularly dull skin needing a deep cleanse. To complement the relaxing properties of the facial, a soothing scalp massage is also offered, encouraging a calm state of mind. Wellbeing treatments include the ‘Intensive Muscle Release,’ a specialised massage that deeply restores stiff, tight aching muscles to instantly release pain and tension. Geraldine Howard, Chairman & Co-Founder of Aromatherapy Associates, said: “Aromatherapy Associates is incredibly proud to be celebrating 30 years as pioneers in aromatherapy. Spa has been at the core of the business since 1985, and we are thrilled to share our expertise in some of the most prestigious spas and selected retail destinations across the world. We are delighted to be expanding our spa offering to include Talise Spa at Jumeirah Frankfurt.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:53:38.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
