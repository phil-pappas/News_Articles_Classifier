The animal preserve owned by the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has turned three of its 30 buses into roving wireless hotspots, using 1 giganet broadband service from Agile Network Builders LLC. Canton-based Agile Networks donated the equipment for converting the three vehicles, and the zoo pays an “incredibly affordable” monthly service fee, said Gregg Oosterbaan , the zoo's vice president for technology services. The nonprofit has not decided if it will outfit all of the buses, he told me. The Wilds switched its headquarters' Internet service last fall to Agile, which I reported recently has now completed statewide build-out of 1-gig service using mainly microwave transmission through the air. In a test of the bus transmitters last week, Wilds and Agile staffers posted to Twitter and Instagram, and even live-streamed a video of feeding giraffes to Periscope. “We liked what we saw,” Oosterbaan said. “There’s some tuning we need to do and maybe a little more equipment. ... It’s a big property and we hit some dead spots.” The Wilds isn't marketing the new service until it can fill in those spots, but it will start telling guests when they board one of the three Wi-Fi buses so they can broadcast their experience to social media. “That’s really the goal – to get the people to tell the stories of their visits,” Oosterbaan said. But sorry, it’s still hard to make a call from the preserve. T-Mobile phones have worked from the trucks, he said, but other carriers block using wireless Internet to place a call. “In most of the Wilds, cell signal is very poor to nonexistent,” Oosterbaan said, \"especially when you get in the valleys.\" \nWant Columbus Travel news in your inbox?
