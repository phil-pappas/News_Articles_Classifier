Now put the sides of your hands around it – right on the wheel. If your hands are there, the clay can’t go anywhere else.” Jon French, one of the craftsmen at Wedgwood, is teaching me the art of throwing a pot. The wheel starts spinning and I cling to the silky lump of Jasper clay. But Jon is a reassuring presence; he persuades me to relax and helps tease the grey ooze into a cylinder, then coax it with fingers and thumbs into a surprisingly presentable vase. For now it’s grey, but when it dries it will be that familiar pale Wedgwood blue. Within these walls sit an expanded museum, remodelled factory tour, and new dining spaces and shops I’m in the Master Craft Studio at World of Wedgwood. It’s just one of the attractions, aimed at young and old, at the new £34 million redevelopment of the estate at Barlaston, which officially opens to the public on July 17. • Hotels in the Midlands for under £150 The revamped global headquarters, set in 240 acres of parkland south of Stoke-on-Trent’s urban sprawl, centres on a large plaza with a water feature created from slate from the original 1960s courtyard, bordered by sleek contemporary buildings fashioned out of grey metal panels and glass, with a bright new atrium for an entrance. Within these walls sit an expanded museum, remodelled factory tour, and new dining spaces and shops. The factory tour is well executed, though not unusual in these parts Today’s workforce, just 200-strong, produces more than half of the 256-year-old pottery’s ceramics. The process – mainly automated yet still employing ancient skills such as fitting handles to cups – can now be viewed from galleries set above different areas of the factory. Diddling sticks, Bullers Rings (a sort of temperature control device) and other curiously named tools of the trade will be available to touch and feel along the trail, which ultimately leads down to the shop floor, where it is possible to peek over the shoulders of the figure makers and artists at work at their benches. The Design Studio has also been opened to the public. Inspired visitors, of all ages, can have a go at throwing a pot and creating transfers in the new Decorating Studio. • Stoke-on-Trent potteries: All fired up in Staffordshire The factory tour is well executed, though not unusual in these parts. More notable is the Tea Emporium, within the new flagship shop (which sells the largest selection of the pottery’s products in the world – there’s a seconds outlet for bargain hunters, too). At the tea bar, I sip Gunpowder and Darjeeling First Flush, two of a choice of 50 blends, prepared for me by tea sommeliers fresh from training with the doyenne of the loose leaf, Jane Pettigrew. At the tea bar, I sip Gunpowder and Darjeeling First Flush, two of a choice of 50 blends The emporium also supplies the world’s first Wedgwood Tea Room (two franchises have already been awarded to partners in Mumbai and Beijing). This modish space, to the rear of the shop, is fitted with luxurious velvet banquettes and lamps adorned with black Jasperware. On tables dressed in crisp white linen, finger sandwiches and scones are presented on the new Parkland collection, its design influenced by the Frog Service, commissioned by Catherine the Great. Only the best-behaved child will fare well here with the £60-a-pop teacups. Better to take them to the relaxed Dining Hall across the plaza, a contemporary take on the original workers’ canteen, with a Fairyland Lustre-themed playroom. (Tire out little legs first on the trails in the nearby woodland.) Where Wedgwood really stands apart is with its historic collection, recently saved for the nation. Now the property of the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, it has been loaned to the newly expanded museum in perpetuity. Three thousand of the 80,000 artefacts are on display in an exhibition that seamlessly follows a timeline from the pottery’s creation by Josiah Wedgwood to the first works by Vera Wang, one of today’s star designers. It’s an epic visual tale, enhanced by subtle use of graphics and state-of-the-art technology. At Wedgwood, Josiah’s innovative spirit lives on. World of Wedgwood (01782 282986; www.worldofwedgwood.com ) will be open daily from next Friday ; Mon-Fri 10am-5pm, Sat-Sun 10am-4pm. Full-day ticket £15 adult, under fives free, family ticket from £30. Creating and decorating pieces from £10 plus postage. Afternoon tea from £25 per person.

Hence, there’s plenty for children to do here this summer, such as confecting clay dainties for a teddy bears’ picnic. Bring ted and they’ll waive the fee. www.emmabridgewaterfactory.co.uk Middleport Pottery Step inside an original brick-built bottle kiln at this newly restored 19th-century china factory.
