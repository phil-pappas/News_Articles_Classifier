The corporation was formed by the merge of CNR Corp and CSR Corp. The government is now planning a pilot programme that could lead to SOEs being open to foreign investment. The vast majority of China’s central state-owned enterprises, which hold overseas assets worth more than 12 trillion yuan (£1.27 trillion), have never been audited, posing a challenge for policymakers promoting SOE reform. Chinese SOEs have branches in more than 150 countries and regions worldwide, according to the State Council’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which regulates nonfinancial SOEs. Chinese SOEs’ overseas assets have grown in recent years through mergers and acquisitions... Overseas units of the 113 non-financial central SOEs under its supervision held assets worth 4.68 trillion yuan by the end of last year, the commission said. In addition, about 18 Chinese financial institutions had also set up 1,127 overseas branches in more than 51 countries and regions with assets of more than 7.45 trillion yuan, according to a report by the China Banking Association. Together, overseas assets of central SOEs exceed 12 trillion yuan, a figure first published in mid-June in a magazine managed by the regulator. However, the number did not include the overseas assets of companies owned by local governments due to a lack of statistics. Local governments controlled 98,554 SOEs by the end of 2012, according to the Ministry of Finance. SOEs have been key players as Chinese enterprises increase their overseas presence... Chinese SOEs’ overseas assets have grown rapidly in recent years through overseas mergers and acquisitions, particularly after 2009, when many companies went to overseas to “buy the dips”, which refers to the practice of purchasing assets after a decline in prices. SOEs have been key players as Chinese enterprises have increased their overseas presence. The country became a net capital exporter last year, with outbound direct investment reaching a record $102.9 billion (£66 billion). Yet SOEs’ overseas assets are “virtually not audited”, according to Dong Dasheng, former deputy auditor-general for the National Audit Office . Comprehensive auditing will allow the regulator to gain knowledge of the situation... Since 2008, out of the 118 SOEs under the supervision of the commission and Finance Ministry, only 57 have been officially audited. The rest were subject to other authorities and most of their assets had never been audited. Mr Dong recommended that all SOEs, including their foreign investments, should be audited every one or two years, with particular focus on revenue and expenditure. The commission has made suggestions in the past regarding overseas asset supervision, including urging state-run companies not to invest in non-principal industries due to the high losses in overseas investment. In March, the regulator issued an invitation for tenders to audit SOEs’ overseas assets, the first time it had made such a move. ... making auditing an institutionalised and transparent system is crucial to preventing corruption and loss of state assets Yet experts who said it would be difficult to practice auditing overseas as it would be costly for a third party to travel to all 150 countries and regions. Xu Baoli, a senior researcher at the commission’s research centre, said the regulator’s invitation showed there are potential risks, or even serious problems, with the overseas assets held by SOEs. “Comprehensive auditing will allow the regulator to gain knowledge of the situation and learn how serious the problems are, so it can take measures,” he said, adding that inefficient management was the root cause of financial problems and corruption. Li Jin, vice president of the China Enterprise Reform and Development Society , a think tank attached to the commission, said making auditing an institutionalised and transparent system is crucial to preventing corruption and loss of state assets.
