Thirty-five paintings by 17 artists are being shown in the United States for the first time at the Ukrainian Museum in Manhattan through the end of August. The art form is known as Petrykivka. Its symbolic motifs feature elements from nature. Roosters stand for rebirth; birds for harmony; a floral bouquet symbolizes the tree of life. Petrykivka art began as ornamentation on adobe whitewashed walls, furniture and other objects. Only a few examples predating the 19th century remain in museum collections. Petryivka is on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:36:08.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
