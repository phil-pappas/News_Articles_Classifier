Imelda May Imelda May and family Sharon McGowan â€“ 14 July 2015 12:00 AM\nThe quirky songstress ( 41) is one of the country's most popular musicians, but she says her little girl is keen to steal the limelight for her and even tells Imelda to stop singing.\n\"She tells me not to sing, that she wants to. She's great,\" she said.\nAlong with her singing talent, the toddler is a chip off the old block in more ways than one.\n\"She's more like me [than husband Darrel]. Apparently she is exactly how I was. She would give anything a try,\" Imelda explained.\n\"She takes a while to warm to people. You have to prove yourself and she takes her time to decide if she wants to talk to you or not. But I like that.\"\nThe rockabilly star is set to return with the second season of her RTE music programme The Imelda May Show later this week.\nDespite making a move into broadcasting, the Dublin native insisted she's happier making music.\nThe Liberties star revealed she has even turned down the offer to judge a TV talent show.\n\"I haven't any notions of being a TV presenter. It's not something I want to do. I have been asked to do various things over the years which I wasn't interested in, you know, like competitions,\" she said.\n\"I don't want to sit and judge anyone.\"\nWhile she prefers being on stage than in front of the camera, Imelda explained she took the presenting job so she could help other established artists with the show.\n\"I don't want to be a TV personality, I am quite happy being a musician. However, I have to put my money where my mouth is because often I would harp on in interviews about needing a proper music show in Ireland,\" she said.\n\"It's all well and good having song competitions but there should be something for bands and people who are already established.\n\"So when it came up, I didn't say 'no I don't want to do it' because there needs to be a show like this.\"\nSpeaking to the RTE Guide, Imelda opened up about her family life growing up about and said her parents inspired her to follow her musical dreams.\n\"[My parents] used to tell me I could do whatever I wanted to do, if I put my mind to it. But they would be practical as well,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T10:59:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
