British Chancellor George Osborne announced yesterday that the government is scrapping permanent non-domiciled status from April 2017.\nAs Osborne reminded the House of Commons on Wednesday, July 8, non-domiciled status was introduced in the UK to make it easier for foreigners to contribute to the British economy before returning to their permanent home.\nThe rules ensured that non-domiciled UK residents only paid taxes on income and capital gains they generated in the country, or on what they made abroad but remitted to the UK. However,the status proved unpopular among UK domiciles, who had to pay tax on all their income and gains, regardless of where they were made.\nBritish Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne poses for the media his official residence, 11 Downing Street in London, prior to unveiling the abolition of permanent non-dom status as part of his new Budget on Wednesday, July 8, 2015 (AP Photo/Matt Dunham)\nThe regime was first tightened in 2008: since then, non domiciles who have resided in the UK for seven out of the previous nine years have been required to pay an annual tax of £30,000 and those who have resided in the country for 12 out of the previous 14 years have had to pay £50,000.\nDespite these changes, however, non-dom status continue to create resentment and, during last Spring’s electoral campaign, Labour leader Ed Miliband announced that, if voted into power, he would abolish it . Labour lost the Election but the victorious Tory government has now introduced its own, somewhat lighter version of the policy.\nFrom April 2017, people who have resided in the UK for more than 15 of the previous 20 years will have to pay taxes on all their worldwide income and gains in Britain.\n“There are some fundamental unfairnesses in the non-dom regime that I am putting a stop to today,” explained Osborne to the House of Commons . “It is not fair that people live in this country for very long periods of their lives, benefit from our public services and yet operate under different tax rules from everyone else. Non-dom status was meant to be temporary, but it became permanent for some people. Not any longer. I am today abolishing permanent non-dom tax status.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/ea22472a98cf4f51a2a4b685ac207aee/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/07/ed-miliband-non-dom-tax-status-labour"], "published": "2015-07-09T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:42:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
