Some acts that could get you in hot water overseas MARCUS STROM AND INGA TING Last updated 11:47, July 15 2015 \nAustralian artist Jodi Magi was arrested in Abu Dhabi over a Facebook post. \nThinking of going to Amsterdam to get stoned? Think again. While \"coffee shops\" still sell all manner of legal ways to get ripped, the law was changed two years ago so that only residents of the Netherlands can legally purchase marijuana in these cafes. \nHow about feeding pigeons in San Francisco or carrying your shopping in a plastic bag in Rwanda? Sounds harmless but both those acts are actually prohibited. \nWith Australian Jodi Magi in jail in the United Arab Emirates \"for writing bad words on social media\", it is worthwhile considering what you think you might be able to do while overseas. Some simple acts could actually land you with a fine - or worse. \nAlcohol \nThe importation and consumption of alcohol is prohibited in many countries. Some countries, such as the Maldives, allow for alcohol consumption in resort areas only. Some countries have blood-alcohol limits of zero for driving, including Belarus, Bolivia, Brazil, Estonia, Hungary, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates. Public displays of drunkenness can land you in jail for two years in Djibouti; it can put you in a sobering-up room in Poland. It is illegal to be under the influence of alcohol at an airport or on a plane in Fiji. \nReligion \nMany countries ban the observance of other religions in public, or the importation of Bibles and religious material. Proselytising Christianity is illegal in many countries and you can be arrested and deported for this activity. Countries that ban non-Islamic public observance and/or proselytising include: Algeria, the Maldives, Bahrain, Brunei, Burma, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, UAE.

Adultery is illegal in Papua New Guinea. Sodomy is illegal in Tonga and some other countries. Co-habitation between unmarried heterosexual couples is illegal in many countries. Sex outside marriage in the United Arab Emirates is illegal. \nOral sex is illegal in the US states of Louisiana and North Carolina. But you can probably relax about this. The US Supreme Court has ruled all laws against private consensual sexual behaviour to be unenforceable. \nHomosexuality \nThe list of countries where it is illegal to be gay and/or carry out \"homosexual acts\" is depressingly long. Check this website on LGBTI travel before you go overseas. \nIdentification \nIt is a legal requirement to carry identification at all times in many countries, including: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Croatia, Cuba, France, Germany.
