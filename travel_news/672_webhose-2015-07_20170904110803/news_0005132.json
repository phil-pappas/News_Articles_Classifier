The start of the school holidays and a decent weather forecast is the perfect seasonal storm for making travel a misery. If, however, you are reading this in a security queue, or on a 10-mile tailback on the M25, you might be wondering if there is any way to make your experience more bearable. A little counter‑intuitive thinking might help. Here are a few solutions that have turned negatives into positives for me over the years. See my holiday survival guide also for advice on how to make a complaint when things go wrong . Make the airport part of the holiday If you have a delay or arrive unexpectedly early at the airport, you don’t have to camp out on bench seats while the children loll next to you fixated on their phones. Instead, blow some of your holiday spending money on a proper meal. That way you get somewhere reasonably civilised to sit, and you won’t need to lug sandwiches with you or pay far too much for revolting food and tepid drinks in-flight. There has been a noticeable improvement in airport restaurants recently. Gordon Ramsay’s Plane Food at Heathrow Terminal Five and Jamie Oliver’s Italian at Gatwick North are two that spring to mind. Don’t believe the departure boards Nothing makes delays more bearable than accurate information, and few places are worse at providing this than airports. With most holiday destinations, flights operate on an out-and-back basis, and I’ve found the best way to work out the real departure time for a flight is to look at the arrivals board for the inbound service. Wait until it is shown as actually having landed, add about 45 minutes, and that should give you an idea of your true departure time. For long delays, use the internet to check the actual outbound departure time, then add the flight time and the 45-minute turnaround. Turn a sight into a service station My favourite strategy for breaking a long journey while avoiding the grim ritual of a service station stop is to dive off the motorway altogether and check out the café in a National Trust stately home. Places such as Knole and Chartwell, just off the M25, Hardwick Hall (M1, pictured below), Burghley House (A1, not National Trust but open to the public) and Quarry Bank Mill (M56) are particularly easy to reach. The National Trust app is useful for finding places and checking opening hours. Turn a detour into a tour In similar vein, if the motorways or autoroutes are tortuous, working out a detour that does more than simply decant you on to A roads can be rewarding. You will take longer to get to your destination, but you will see places that you might never get to otherwise. I once took a D-road diversion to avoid some appalling traffic while driving south through France, and ended up discovering the source of the River Seine. Use jet lag to your advantage Not limited to peak season, of course, but made worse by its stresses. Even if the time difference at your destination is only a couple of hours, the offset between body clock and local time will turn you either into an early riser or a night owl. Instead of fighting the difference, embrace it. Dance the night away in Bodrum, or watch the sunrise in Manhattan. Failing to sleep on arrival in Tokyo, I got up to visit the famous early-morning fish market – I never would have managed to drag myself out of bed if my body clock had been ticking normally. • The best family days out from Manchester • The best family days out from Birmingham • The best family days out from Newcastle • The best family days out from London", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T21:04:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
