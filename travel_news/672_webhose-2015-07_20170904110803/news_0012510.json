A British man is tackled to the ground in Tenerife after behaving inappropriately towards women passengers on the plane and passing out in the plane loo. Picture: KeiranCampbell/BNPS. Source: Picture Media \nA BRITISH man has been banned for life from Ryanair after he passed out in the loo for 30 minutes and allegedly harassed women on a flight. \nThe man, believed to be in his 20s or early 30s, was on a flight from Bournemouth to Tenerife when he allegedly became aggressive towards crew and other passengers. When the plane landed he had to be carried off the aircraft and was wrestled to the ground by Spanish police. \nA passenger on the plane, Keiran Campbell, 37, told the Metro the trouble began when the man started harassing some women in the row in front of him. The man was carried off the plane by his feet and arms. Picture: KeiranCampbell/BNPS Source: Picture Media \n“I think it all kicked off because a bloke stuck up for them. He tried to fight him but then he passed out in the toilet for at least half an hour, maybe an hour. \n“It all calmed down a bit but kicked off again when we landed. The captain said the police needed to come on board and when they took him off they literally had to carry him off by his feet and arms,” he said. \nA Ryanair spokesperson told the Metro the man had been given a lifetime ban. \n“The crew of this flight from Bournemouth to Tenerife requested police assistance after a passenger became disruptive in-flight,” the spokesperson said. \n“The aircraft landed normally and police removed and detained this individual upon arrival at Tenerife. \n“We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and we sincerely apologise to other customers for any inconvenience caused.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:18:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
