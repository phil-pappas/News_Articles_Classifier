Adv: \nJul 12, 2015 Adv: \nA private July 11 memorial service to mark the first anniversary of the MH17 tragedy has been held in Kuala Lumpur, marking almost a year since the tragedy. The Malaysian PM asked for “the fullest cooperation” internationally in gathering irrefutable evidence against the perpetrators. \nFlight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine, was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, carrying 298 people on board. Everyone on board was killed, with the tragedy’s victims including the nationals of ten different countries, with 44 Malaysians among them. The investigation is led by the Netherlands, as the majority of the victims were Dutch. \nThe fullest cooperation of all nations concerned is vital so that the investigation will be able to “gather irrefutable evidence as to what happened and especially as to who were responsible for this unforgivable incident,” Malaysian Prime Minister Mohd Najib bin Abdul Razak said.. The PM said closure to this tragic incident is absolutely vital. \nSome 1,000 people, relatives, friends and loved ones, attended the ceremony and held a minute of silence remembering those they lost. Razak urged the families to stay strong until the investigation into the tragedy is complete. \nWhile the joint international investigation team had a “clear picture” of what had caused the crash of Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 over Ukraine on July 17 last year, the minister emphasized that the probe is far from over. \nThe technical investigation team led by the Dutch Safety Board and made up of experts from the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine, the US, Russia, UK and Australia is expected to submit its final report in October. In June, accredited representatives of each country involved in the investigation received a draft of the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T11:57:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
