Following the retirement of Jean-Louis Leimbacher, Jean-Luc Cousty was named Director of the Hotel du Palais by Michel Veunac, Mayor of Biarritz and President of the S.E.M (corporate owner of the Hotel du Palais). Jean-Luc Cousty will in fact be ensuring the transition in the role of General Manager of the Hotel du Palais in Biarritz until a ruling is made concerning this luxury hotel’s next mode of management. \nThis represents a whole new challenge for this 51 year-old seasoned professional who boasts an impressive career in the luxury hotel industry. After his studies at the Hotel School of Bordeaux, he begins his career at the age of 21 in Paris as a receptionist at the Hotel du Louvre. He then joins the Hotel Lutetia for the first time in 1990 as Administrative Director, before taking on the same position at the Concorde La Fayette Hotel. Back at the Hotel Lutetia in 1996, he worked 3 years as Operating Director, in charge of F&B. He changes tack in 1999, when he joins the Le Méridien Etoile hotel as General Manager before returning to his first love in 2008, taking the helm as General Manager of the Hotel Lutetia. For 6 years, he helps the Left Bank’s only luxury class hotel write a new chapter in its long history by organizing its centenary celebrations and spreading its influence via many literary, artistic and gastronomic events, right up until the hotel’s closing for renovations. “It is with great pride that I take on the immense challenge of directing the iconic Hotel du Palais in Biarritz. My goal is, first and foremost, to support and build the future of this legendary luxury hotel of South-West France boasting 153 rooms and suites, 3 restaurants including one starred venue and a 3000m2 high-end spa in collaboration with Guerlain, voted Best Spa in Europe & the Mediterranean”, declares Jean-Luc Cousty.
