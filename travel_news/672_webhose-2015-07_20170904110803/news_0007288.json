At one end of the city rises a hill named Bright Moon Peak. Across the river, a chain of limestone peaks forms the backbone of Seven Star Park.\nIs it any wonder the Chinese have long called the area the “best under heaven”?\nHowever, stand atop Bright Moon Peak and it quickly becomes clear that they’re not just alluding to place names.\nFar below the limestone hill, the blue roofline of Guilin is split by the Li River, which National Geographic once named one of the world’s 10 watery wonders. But what most catches the eye are the multitude of karst hills that rise like quills throughout Guilin. In this heavenly city’s stunning setting, peaks far outnumber high rises.\nGuilin might easily be called modern China’s first city of tourism. After the 1949 Communist revolution, it was the first Chinese city to redevelop tourism. But even that claim seems trivial when you’re standing in Seven Star Park.\nThe largest of Guilin’s parks, Seven Star has been open to visitors since the seventh century AD and has been claimed as one of China’s oldest tourist sites. At its heart is a village-like green, set between the park’s seven limestone hills. Around the park there are carnival games, horse and buggy rides and wild monkeys scampering about the trees. Children feed koi goldfish in ponds at the base of waterfalls, and adults perform tai chi or play musical instruments on the slopes of the hills. Seven Star Park is among China’s oldest tourist sites.

To wander here is to see Guilin at play.\nBack across the river, in the city centre, Guilin exudes a sophistication and ease that seems to reflect its long contact with visitors. Along the riverbank, a wide promenade lined with the city’s most bohemian little cafes – Nissi Station, G+, Little Italian and Steam Coffee – brings an air of Europe to the city.\nTall, fragrant osmanthus trees, which give their name to the city (Guilin translates as “forest of sweet osmanthus”), shade the promenade from the persistent heat. Beneath the arching canopy of these trees, the city seems to wake each dawn to dance. Groups waltz together, individuals swing imaginary partners, and old men dust off youthful hips to pound out rock steps. Around them, card games march endlessly on through the day. Footpaths around Guilin's lakes. Picture: Andrew Bain Source: Supplied\nFrom the promenade’s edge, a string of lakes wraps like a horseshoe around the city. The four lakes were originally built as a defensive moat, but today form a green band almost 2km in length enclosing the pedestrian malls and streets of the modern city centre.\nTourist boats skim across the interconnected lakes, and walking tracks amble beneath the tall trees at their edges. In Shanhu Lake, a pair of pagodas spears side by side out of the water. The Sun and Moon Pagodas – glowing suitably gold and silver when lit at night – look as ancient as dynastic China, but in reality they’re as modern as the country’s changing face. The original pagodas were built more than 1000 years ago, but were destroyed by Japanese bombing in World War II.\nRebuilt in 2001, the 41m-high Sun Pagoda is said to be the tallest copper pagoda in the world, and behind its seemingly ancient facade is an elevator to carry visitors to its upper floors. An underwater tunnel connects the two pagodas.\nStep beyond the four lakes and this city of almost one million residents reveals itself as a place of parks as much as people. Like Seven Star Park, each one is typically framed around the limestone peaks, providing glimpses into caves and glances out over the city skyline. They have names as gorgeous as the views – Solitary Beauty Peak, Wave Subduing Hill, Folded Brocade Hill (aka Bright Moon Peak) – and sunsets are transformed into perfection from atop any of their summits.

Elephant Trunk Hill might be among the lowest of the city’s karst peaks, but it’s also the most famous and popular.\nHere, at the point where the Li and Pearl Blossom rivers merge, an arch of rock forms a shape a little like the trunk of a drinking elephant.\nBamboo rafts motor across the Pearl Blossom River to a tourist platform inside the arch, and the hill above is a maze of walking trails that climb to a multitude of lookouts.\nStaring out over the city from the lookouts, limestone and concrete seem to merge, with the few sections of high-rise apartment blocks rising in imitation of the peaks.\nHowever for most visitors, the view that counts is the one from the riverbank, looking across the river junction to the arch, which is a perfect doughnut bored through the limestone.\nOne legend tells of an elephant coming from heaven to Earth and drinking from the river. The gods turned the animal to stone when it decided this spot was so beautiful it didn’t want to return to heaven.\nLike the Chinese themselves, the elephant thought it had found it right here in Guilin.\nThe writer travelled as a guest of SpiceRoads.\nGO2\nGUILIN\nGETTING THERE\nChina Southern flies daily to Guangzhou from Sydney and Melbourne, with onward connections to Guilin, which is about an hour’s flight from Guangzhou.\nPh 1300 889 628 or see csair.com/au/en\nSTAYING THERE\nAlong the riverbank, the small Homeland River View Hotel has one of the best locations in the city, plus enormous beds.
