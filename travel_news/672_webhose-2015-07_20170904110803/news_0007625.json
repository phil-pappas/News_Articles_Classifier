Telegraph Ski and Snowboard editor Henry Druce experienced the adrenalin rush of skeleton last season with Amy and was so impressed that we have decided to offer Telegraph Ski and Snowboard readers the opportunity to try it themselves. Olympian Amy Williams will be on hand to give expert guidance to the 24 participants, who can expect to go at up to 100kph down the 1232m track, which is at the Olympic Sliding Centre just outside Innsbruck. Before going full pelt on a skeleton, there will be a number of practice runs, and you’ll experience the full length of the track as a passenger in a four-man race bobsleigh. On this adrenalin rush weekend break with specialist operator Momentum Ski you’ll stay in luxury at Innsbruck’s only five-star hotel, the Grand Hotel Europa, and enjoy two top-quality dinners – the first at the hotel, the second at one of Innsbruck’s excellent restaurants, where Amy will round off the trip with an awards ceremony.
