He says: “Too many SMEs put much time into perfecting content but suffer from lack of critical number of opt-in followers. “The solution is to invest a small sum into Facebook ads, which will bring audience numbers up to levels that will lead to a percentage of click-throughs to your website. SMEs should bear in mind people on Facebook are browsing rather than shopping. “The next stage is just to add value. Provide useful content and engaging conversation. Then provide links to further valuable content that lives on your website. This gets potential customers onto your site. The point of all of this is that, when they are ready to buy, your business will come first to mind because of the value and engagement [relationship building] you've created in the interim.” Be different Never underestimate the power of exclusivity, says Rowan Evans, head of social media at digital marketing company Greenlight. “Trite as it might sound, social audiences love to feel they are in on something new before others, so playing up the new, exclusive, imported or even exotic angle of your product or service will help generate a buzz among early adopters.” He adds: “Highly targeted paid promotion of appropriate content will help give brands the best results but this hinges on carrying out the necessary research to dictate your strategy. Testing and reiterating the right promotions will allow small businesses to build up an accurate picture of their audience.” Beat the competition Running competitions is a great way to attract viewers and “likers”. Asking people to share in exchange for a competition entry is a quick and easy way to increase brand awareness. “But be ultra careful when using Facebook for competitions,” says public affairs expert Peter Bould. “There are a lot of fake likes around so always have a human final decision-making process in place for any competitions.” Be visual Sites such as canva.com can help you create passable images free but, says Rich Leigh, founder and director of PR company Rich Leigh & Company, “it’s not just looking pretty that’s the issue here. “The reach [the number of people that see your post] is affected by the type of post you do. If you post links and plain text updates the post won’t have as great a reach as if you use images or video. Facebook has an invisible algorithm at play and it’s all about giving users a better experience to keep them coming back - and, more cynically, curtailing your efforts at using Facebook as a free ad medium.” Mr Leigh adds: “One way to get around the fact links don’t reach very far is to trick Facebook by uploading an image first and then including a link in the written part of your status.” Act fast John Morris, chief operating officer of web hosting company UK2 Group, says: “In a single minute, 3.3 million pieces of new content are shared on Facebook. Think like a customer – and in turn, what you as a customer would want to see. “Customers expect a response to any queries or comments within an hour and research suggests that a solution should be reached within six hours to maintain customer satisfaction. For SMEs this is so important, as word of mouth is a key part of growing your customer base – keep your customers engaged until a solution is reached.” The new Saved Replies feature on Facebook also allows administrators to quickly respond to customer inquiries with pre-written responses, such as directing them to the help desk – a quick way to maintain customer satisfaction if you are pressed for time. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow Discover more tips and advice for SMEs: • The business tech guide to summer working • How you can protect your business • What do micropayments mean for SMEs? • Online payment advice for SMEs • Urica: a quick fix for slow payments?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:45:27.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
