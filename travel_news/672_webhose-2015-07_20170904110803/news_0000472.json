There's nothing in the works to change the frequency of the company's Bellagio fountain show, she said.\nThe volcano is scheduled to erupt at 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday. An additional 10 p.m. show will be offered Friday and Saturday.\nThe Strip evolved into something more akin to a theme park when casino mogul Steve Wynn debuted the volcano at The Mirage, which was followed by a fiery pirate ship battle in front of the Treasure Island and the now-iconic fountain show in front of the Bellagio.\nSince then, the Strip has never stopped evolving, said David Schwartz, director of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' Center for Gaming Research.\n\"I think what gets people inside is shifting,\" Schwartz said of what drives a tourist to venture from the sidewalk into a casino. There are simply more entertainment options, he said.\nLarge-scale free entertainment outside of the area's casinos has diminished in recent years, but street-facing restaurants and retail, where money can be made, have cropped up.\nTreasure Island was sold in 2009, and the pirate battle disappeared nearly two years ago.\nAfter becoming the owner of The Mirage, MGM spent $25 million in 2008 upgrading the volcano with more fire choreographed to a pounding drum-beat soundtrack. At the time, executives said the challenge continued to be getting the show's numerous watchers to walk inside the casino to spend money.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:12:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
