Martin", "Frank Lloyd Wright"], "text": "BUFFALO – It was one of America’s most interesting homes when it was built in 1905 for $45,000, but being the private residence of Darwin D. Martin, you couldn’t simply walk in and wander through its unique rooms. \nBut now after a $50-million restoration rescued the home from 20 years of abuse, neglect and abandonment, you can marvel at the innovative ideas Frank Lloyd Wright applied to what many call the finest example of his Prairie Home concept. \nThe Martin House Complex is nearing the end of its long road back from death’s door and becoming one of Buffalo’s most popular tourist attractions. Many of the original structural features designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, one of the world’s most famous architects, but damaged or destroyed over the decades, had to be duplicated with enough precision for the home to qualify as a National Historic Landmark. \nWright also designed 55 pieces of furniture for the home and there is strong speculation that one of his Martin tables may today be serving as the desk for the dean at University of Toronto’s Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design . \nRumour has it that the table was placed out in the garbage when Martin House was an abandoned shell of its original splendour. University of Toronto architectural students used to visit the empty house to make drawings and measurements of what was once one of the most coveted houses in America. \nMary Roberts, executive director of the Martin House Complex , said researchers on both sides of the border are discretely checking out the rumours. “If it is true and we can persuade the University of Toronto to repatriate the table, it’ll be one of our last installments in a long, challenging campaign to restore Frank Lloyd Wright’s Martin House.” \nMartin was one of Buffalo’s wealthiest citizens when Buffalo was one of America’s wealthiest cities at the turn of the last century. He was a senior executive at Larkin Soap Company, one of America’s largest retailers. \nIt was his task to find an architect to build a new administration headquarters for the growing company and he heard about a young Chicago architect making a name for himself. Martin and Frank Lloyd Wright became life-long friends and he asked his friend to design a home for him suitable for a wealthy executive. \nWright also designed a new HQ for Larkin Soap. Although it was an office building it featured many innovations. The five-storey dark red brick building used pink-tinted mortar and utilized steel frame construction. People marveled at its air conditioning, stained-glass windows, built-in desk furniture, and suspended toiletry bowls. \nIt was dismantled in 1950 and the renowned house Wright designed for Martin almost suffered the same fate. \nMartin lived in his house for more than 30 years, but the 1929 stock market crash left him penniless. When Wright’s first book on architecture was published in the ’30s, Martin couldn’t afford the $6 price, so Wright supplied a copy free. \nArchitectural scholars consider the Martin House Complex Wright’s finest architectural achievement. \nIt had five interconnected buildings, including the main Darwin D. Martin House. The 1,540 square feet pergola connected it to a conservatory and carriage house with chauffeur’s quarters and stables. It also connected to George Barton House (4,400 sq. ft.), a smaller residence for Martin’s sister and brother-in-law. A gardener’s cottage was added in 1909. \nThree of the five structures were demolished over the years, but exact replicas are today standing in their place. A six-storey apartment building had been built where the pergola again does its job of connecting the various homes. \nInside the main house, much of Wright’s elaborate interior features had to be refurbished. There is approximately 10 kilometres of intricate woodworking in Darwin D. Martin House. Blending the outdoors with the indoors was one of Wright’s passions and in the house he used more than 300 stained glass windows to marry the two. \nMost of Wright’s windows are newly constructed. So too are the yellow, thin-profile bricks used on interior walls and the pergola. Roberts said they too had to look 100 years old to satisfy the requirements for a National Historic Landmark designation. \nAbout $10 million of the $50 million restoration budget was spent on creating a modern glass reception and interpretive pavilion, separate of the Martin House Complex. It was designed by Toshiko Mori , chair of the department of architecture at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design . The Greatbatch Pavilion was funded by Wilson and Eleanor Greatbatch. Buffalo native Greatbatch was an engineer and entrepreneur who invented the pacemaker. \nThe Martin House Complex is playing a significant role in Buffalo’s renaissance. The city has discovered its waterfront again and what used to be a grungy industrial neighbourhood is now very much a people place. Architects, developers and city planners are retaining the waterfront`s industrial architecture and character, but instead of loading grain ships and Erie Canal barges the warehouses, docklands and waterways are hosting festivals, summer playgrounds, trendy restaurants and recreational boating. \nIF YOU GO More information is available at darwinmartinhouse.org . © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T08:18:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
