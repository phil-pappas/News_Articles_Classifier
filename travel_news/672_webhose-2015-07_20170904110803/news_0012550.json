Spokeswoman Brie Ogle said Thursday that while the airline can understand the threats are generating a great deal of interest, it will not comment on rumors. A bomb threat believed to be a hoax Wednesday night prompted WestJet to divert a Vancouver-to-Toronto flight to Calgary. A flight on Tuesday from Toronto landed at Saskatoon following a threat. Police say no bomb was found. A flight from Edmonton to Toronto was diverted to Winnipeg on Monday because of an unspecified threat. A Saturday flight from Edmonton to Halifax landed in Saskatoon after police say a call was made claiming an explosive device was on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:52:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
