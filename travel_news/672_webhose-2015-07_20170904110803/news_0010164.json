But as summer hotel offers go, it's not bad. \nOffer Details \nBetween July 7 and September 27, Club Carlson members can earn 2,000 bonus points for every Carlson Rezidor night booked on a Carlson website or mobile app. \nRegistration is required. \nDeal or No Deal \nClub Carlson members normally earn 20 points per $1 spent. Assuming a hypothetical stay of one $100 night, you'd earn 2,000 points. In that scenario, a 2,000-point bonus amounts to earning double points. \nViewed from a different perspective, free nights in the Club Carlson program can be had for as few as 9,000 points. So two one-night stays at $150 each, including the bonuses, could qualify you for a free night at a Category 1 hotel. And three one-night stays could qualify for a Category 2 hotel award night, which costs 15,000 points. \nAll in all, this is a decent bonus that is readily earnable. \nThe Carlson mobile app is available for both Apple and Android platforms. \nYou Might Also Like:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:13:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
