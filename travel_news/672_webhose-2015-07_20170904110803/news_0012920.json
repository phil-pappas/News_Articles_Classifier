The resort will complement AccorHotels network of existing hotels on the Sunshine Coast – The Sebel Noosa, The Sebel Maroochydore, the Grand Mercure Apartments Twin Waters and iconic Novotel Twin Waters Resort. \n\n\n\nSimon Ambrose, CEO at Sunshine Coast Destination Ltd said, “The branding of Pelican Waters to The Sebel is great news for the Sunshine Coast as it brings a renowned hotel brand to the region. The Sebel brand resinates strongly with the leisure and conference markets, both in Australia and internationally.” \n\n\n\nLocated just 90 minutes by road from Brisbane and 40 minutes from the Sunshine Coast Airport, The Sebel Pelican Waters Golf Resort & Spa is situated on a championship golf course and offers 76 resort rooms (which include spa suites and one and two bedroom apartment options). The Sebel also offers a day spa, swimming pool plus restaurant and bar options. \n\n\n\nA popular wedding and conference destination, the resort includes a selection of outdoor and indoor events spaces, including six meeting rooms with capacity for up to 320 people theatre style, or 350 guests for a cocktail reception. \n\n\n\nWith the addition of The Sebel Pelican Waters Golf Resort & Spa, The Sebel network now boasts 24 properties across Australia and New Zealand, accommodating the Accor group’s apartment portfolio whilst also maintaining a traditional hotel and resort offering to meet current consumer demands. \n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Accor announced two more new addresses for The Sebel brand in Victoria and Queensland with The Sebel South Brisbane (now open) and upcoming $35 million waterfront project, The Sebel Yarrawonga. \n\n\n\nThe Sebel is Accor’s premier hotels and apartments brand offering guests a greater level of independence and control. With over 23 properties across Australia and New Zealand, The Sebel network provides traditional hotel service and apartments that meet the modern guest’s expectations. \n\n\n\nThe Sebel Town House first opened its doors in Sydney over 50 years ago and since then the brand has become known for its well-trained staff and excellence in customer service. \nSource: Accor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:05:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
