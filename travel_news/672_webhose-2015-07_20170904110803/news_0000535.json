He was also concerned about the environmental effects of mass tourism and wants to promote the islands as a destination for activity and adventure breaks, rather than just low-cost beach holidays. Speaking to the El Pais newspaper, Clavijo said that tourists who come on an all-inclusive basis are of less use to the economy. He said that a limit should be set that respects the environment and does not adversely affect the appeal of the Canaries as a holiday destination for nature lovers. Clavijo also told the Times: “The pursuit of the largest number of tourists is killing quality in Spain. It is the Magaluf effect. “Lots of people come from Britain and what they need is a quality resort. We don’t want to attract 20 million tourists each year and then they do not have a good time. We may need to put limits” he added. Annie Bennett, the author of our expert guide to Lanzarote , said: “While large areas of all the islands are designated nature reserves and are already popular for outdoor tourism, Clavijo is likely to meet fierce opposition to any plans to limit visitor numbers with the knock-on effect on jobs in a region where 30 per cent of people are unemployed, rising to 56 per cent for the under 25s. She said that, while Fuerteventura has already put a limit on visitor numbers, the other major islands – Tenerife and Gran Canaria as well as Lanzarote – may follow suit. “These are very early days, however,” she said, “and Clavijo said he plans to hold talks with all the local governments to decide on a policy to improve the overall quality of tourism on the islands, rather than just attract more tourists. He is going to simplify planning regulations to make it easier to undertake renovation work, as 75 per cent of hotels and self-catering accommodation is now more than 25 years old and two thirds of it needs to be modernised.” A quiet beach on Lanzarote In Lanzarote, strict environmental controls have been in force for decades, she added, “but the local government has so far not shown much interest in promoting the island as an eco-friendly destination, even though resort tourism is limited to a handful of areas and many tourists these days are attracted by the superb conditions for watersports, cycling and hiking, as well as the beaches.” Anna Nicholas, a Telegraph blogger based in Majorca, said that in her opinion however, the more desirable areas of Majorca will never be affected by the type of tourism Magaluf attracts . Magaluf on a summer's night “It is a microcosm,” she said, “a parallel universe and is not a reflection of real, authentic Majorca at all. “Majorca is largely unspoilt despite the annual volume of tourists. Increasingly the regional government is promoting quality tourism and in the next few years even Magaluf will have changed as more investment pours into the resort and bad behaviour is quashed.” The Canary Islands received around 13 million visitors last year, according to reports.
