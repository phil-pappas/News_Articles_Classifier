The relaxed evenings will be full of fun and conversation and will take place in the opulent surroundings of Dewsall’s Orangery style conservatory. Chase Distillery will also be on hand with a selection of Dewsall cocktails that have been created for the events, such as the Dewsall Martini which contains Chase Elegant Gin, Chase Blackcurrant Liqueur and Blanc Vermouth. The first dinner, on Thursday 17th September will be sponsored by Pol Roger Champagne and hosted by the extremely talented Ben Tish who is Chef Director of the Salt Yard Group. The group comprises of Salt Yard in Fitzrovia, Dehesa and Ember Yard in Soho and Opera Tavern in Covent Garden, all specialising in a rare and delicious mix of food and wine from Spain & Italy. Following this, Valentine Warner will be hosting a Halloween themed party with some spooktacular surprises up his sleeve on October 31st, before Sabrina Ghayour takes over the kitchen for a special Valentine’s weekend event on February 13th. Specialising in Persian and Middle Eastern flavours, Sabrina was named by The Observer Newspaper as one of the ‘Rising Stars of 2014’, and her cookbook has been on the best seller list ever since it was published. One of the freshest, most talented names in the food world, Ravinder Bhogul will be hosting a dinner party on March 31st. Jay Rayner said that she “has a brilliant understanding of spicing and pitch perfect taste. Her dishes are the kind that make you sit up and pay attention. And then ask for more. She’s a true talent.” Dewsall which is only usually available for exclusive use bookings will become an ‘Open House’ on the evenings of the events, where guests can book one of the houses ten stunning bedrooms that are each complete with their own feature bathroom.
