SORTA’s board will meet on Monday morning to vote on a contract, which is expected to be awarded to French firm Transdev Services Inc., which has a U.S. headquarters in Illinois, on a turnkey basis. Rail services director Paul Grether suggested the agreement with Transdev because it was determined to be the best option for both contract methods. Under the turn-key method, the company will provide all management, operations and maintenance personnel. The choice will fit within the budget established by the city of Cincinnati, and the fixed-cost contract will include startup plus five years along with five one-year optional extensions. Here’s the cost breakdown: Startup through Sept. 15, 2016: $1.1 million Year 1 beginning Sept. 15, 2016: $3.27 million Maximum startup, base contract + 5 option years: $38.3 million The contract includes operation of the streetcars, maintenance of the vehicles and maintenance of most streetcar infrastructure including tracks, power systems, stations and the maintenance and operations facility. Transdev will begin work in late July to prepare for the arrival of the first streetcar vehicles this fall. SORTA disclosed that four other proposals were received from AECOM URS Energy & Construction Inc., First Transit Inc., Herzog Transit Services Inc., RATP Dev/McDonald Transit LLC. The firms hadn’t been revealed earlier because of federal regulations. Transdev has rail contracts in the United States and internationally, including the New Orleans streetcar system, which is the largest in the nation. Its management team for Cincinnati will have more than 100 years of combined experience. Over the past two weeks, Cincinnati City Council has failed to come to a consensus on whether ATU Local 627 members who work for SORTA but are managed by a private company should drive the streetcars or whether a private company should hire all of the streetcar employees. Because council punted, the decision now is up to the SORTA board. The Cincinnati streetcar is a $133 million project with 18 stops along a 3.6-mile route. \nWant Cincinnati Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
