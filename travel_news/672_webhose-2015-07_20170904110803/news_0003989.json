But by stripping out the exceptional cost the underlying result actually rose by 3% to £50.6 million. \nThe group’s package holiday division continues to grow with 1 million people (+20%) now using the company. The figure represents a third of the overall number of customers. \nGroup turnover rose 12% to £1.3 billion with leisure travel turnover up 14% to £1.1 billion. \nAccording to the company 52% of Jet2holidays packages are sold direct via the website, 17% via the call centre and the rest via high street and online travel agents. \nLeisure airline Jet2.com now flies 217 routes up from 205 in the previous year. \nThe company expects to continue its growth in the current financial year. \n“Notwithstanding the tragedy in Tunisia and uncertainties in Greece, we are optimistic that Group performance for the financial year to 31 March 2016 will exceed current market expectations,” said chairman Philip Meeson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:32:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
