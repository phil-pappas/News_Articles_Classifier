He was shot with a dart by a South African National Parks (SANParks) veterinary officer from a helicopter and brought to safety under extremely difficult conditions.\nNico van der Walt, the Park Manager of the Karoo National Park, said Tuesday that the lion had to be loaded onto a sling underneath the helicopter while lying immobilised on the mountain side. “This was the most dangerous part of the operation as the helicopter blades were not more than two metres from the mountain edge with the lion lying three metres from a high cliff.”\nIt is suspected the young male was chased away by older lions and escaped from the park on June 5, 2015 through a spot in the fence which had been damaged following heavy rain.\nThe lion has now been released into a boma (enclosure) and has been fitted with a tracking collar. “We are happy to report that it is in good health and it would be put under observation for the time being,” said van der Walt.\nSANParks Chief Executive Officer Fundisile Mketeni congratulated the team for their professionalism in tracking and recapturing the lion.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit South African Airways (SAA) has embarked upon a sustainable aviation fuel program South Africa’s new tourism campaign covers significant Indian cities Road accidents costing South Africa billions of rands per year", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:24:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
