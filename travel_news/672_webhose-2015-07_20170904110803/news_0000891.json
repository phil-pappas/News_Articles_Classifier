With rivers, mountains and farmland dominating the state’s landscape, it’s been said if you flatten all the mountains in Idaho, the state would be the size of Texas. The state of Idaho has an abundance of adventure activities to take part in, from white-water rafting to horseback riding; there is an activity for visitors of all ages and all skill levels. \n1. Horseback Riding – Visitors can relive the old West in Idaho where they can choose from a number of ranches spread across the state. Ranching activities include cattle drives, wagon rides, riding lessons, trail riding, roping, penning, and branding. Not all horse riding activities take place at ranches; horseback riders can enjoy the many trails and camping opportunities in wilderness areas where there are trails specifically designed for horseback riding. Every region of the state offers a state park with something special for horse riding enthusiasts. These include Harriman State Park where there is an outfitter in the park for public rides. 2. White-Water Rafting - Something for the thrill seekers! The first commercial river rafting trips in the United States were launched in Idaho. With more recreational river miles than any other state, Idaho has plenty of places to go river rafting. Idaho Outfitters offer rafting trips of all kinds for visitors of all ages and abilities. The outfitters offer assistance from start to finish, including rowing the rafts or leading guests in paddling their own, providing tents and waterproof gear bags, cooking meals and leading games on the beach and around the campfire. Rivers that visitors can raft on include: Snake River, Salmon River and Payette River. 3. Biking – Visitors travel from all over the world to enjoy both mountain and road biking in the most pristine and tranquil locations that Idaho has to offer. Idaho has more than 12,000 miles of single track and even more 4 wheel drive dirt roads. Road bikers can take part in the Trail of the Coeur D'Alene's, this is a 72 mile paved pathway, extending from Plummer to Mullan. A fun way to enjoy mountain biking is to take advantage of the Idaho City Area Trails and Yurt System. Here you can mountain bike by day and spend the night in a backcountry yurt by night. 4. Hiking – When it comes to hiking in Idaho there are a number of different options to choose from. These include hiking in State Parks, National Forests and Wilderness Areas. There are trails for everyone, from short hikes for the whole family to once-in-a-lifetime hiking and overnight backpacking experiences. Idaho offers some of the most unspoilt wilderness areas in the lower 48 states, here visitors can follow a trail through river canyons, hike to crystal alpine lakes or jagged peaks, or find solitude on thousands of miles of hiking trails. Popular wilderness areas for hiking include Sawtooth National Recreation Area and the Frank Church Wilderness area. 5.
