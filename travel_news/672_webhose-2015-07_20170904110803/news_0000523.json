Haimark Line and United Caribbean Lines are seeking final approval to operate Miami-to-Cuba cruises starting Feb. 20. The companies need approval from both the Cuban government and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of Treasury to send travelers on the 105-cabin MS Saint Laurent to the island, because recreational travel between the countries is still prohibited despite relaxed relations. Bruce Nierenberg , president of United Caribbean Lines, said they are awaiting the same type of approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce that Carnival Corp. was granted for its Cuba trips. The cruise giant plans to add a Cuba itinerary to its newly rolled out cruise line, Fathom. Nierenberg told the South Florida Business Journal that United Caribbean Lines already has approval to operate ferries from the U.S. to Cuba, and now needs to amend its approval to include the right to keep people on its ship rather than simply transporting them from one country to the other. \"Negotiations are nearly completed with the Cuban government,\" Nierenberg said. \"It's a win-win for both the U.S. and Cuba and we're anticipating rapid acceptance.\" Once Haimark and United Caribbean Lines receives approval, the nine-night roundtrip cruises would be $4,599 a person, plus applicable port charges and fees. \"One of several advantages of small coastal ship travel to Cuba right now is that the MS Saint Laurent will be able to reach additional regions of Cuba and increase the people-to-people connection of the American public with the people of Cuba throughout the Island,\" Nierenberg said. Fathom's ship would court about 700 passengers. United Caribbean Lines is based in Central Florida, but it will open a Miami office to begin operating its Cuba-Florida ferry service possibly in early August. The company currently has plans to serve ports in Miami and Tampa. Upon approval, United Caribbean Lines would arrive in Cuba before Carnival Corp., as Fathom plans to host cultural cruises to the island by May 2016. However, the Doral-based company still needs approval from the Cuban government as well. \nWant South Florida Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
