Nick Waight, Managing Director of Group Convention Centres, said: “When we found out that our NEC Group charity of the year, Birmingham Children’s Hospital, was putting together such an exciting public art event with one of the country’s top creative producers, Wild in Art, we just had to get involved and support them. “The Big Hoot is a fantastic project that will hopefully capture the imagination of the public, and the ICC was the perfect place to host some sculptures as 80,000 people pass through the mall on a weekly basis. We hope locals will become a tourist in their own city whilst visitors from across the UK will take advance of our transport links and see what a wonderful place Birmingham – all while raising money for the Children’s Hospital.’ All the owls have been sponsored by local businesses and will be auctioned at the end of the trail in October with the hope of raising over £250k for the Children’s Hospital. Elinor Eustace, Deputy Director of Fundraising at Birmingham Children’s Hospital Charity said: “The Big Hoot will be a fantastic spectacle for Birmingham and will help to raise valuable funds for our hospital. “We’re delighted the NEC Group has chosen to support us as its charity of the year and that the ICC has offered a safe home for some of the amazing owl sculptures on The Big Hoot trail. It is thanks to them that we will ultimately be able to fund some important projects for the children and young people at our hospital and for that we’re immensely grateful.” Sally-Ann Wilkinson, Director of Wild in Art said: We are thrilled to have the ICC involved with The Big Hoot trail. Our public art projects have a proven track record of increasing community engagement and we’re confident that this will continue in Birmingham, as visitors and residents alike discover the city through this unique and visually stunning artistic trail.” Alongside the giant 165cm owls there will be a further 120 smaller ‘owlets’, fondly known as ‘The Little Hoot’. These owlets are part of a citywide education programme which has engaged with over 25,000 young children from nursery, primary, secondary and special schools together a college and four community groups. These can be viewed at 18 venues across the city. At the end of the 10 week trail, the owlets will be returned to the schools that created them as a memento of The Big Hoot, whereas the large owls will be auctioned in October to raise funds for Birmingham Children’s Hospital Charity.
