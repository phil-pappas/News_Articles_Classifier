The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.96 percent to 5,039.78.\nNine of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 1.35 percent fall leading the decliners.\nWith second-quarter reports well under way, analysts expect overall earnings of S&P 500 companies to dip 0.3 percent and revenue to decline 3.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nSuch results could inflate already relatively pricey valuations. The S&P 500 trades near 16.9 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data.\n“Valuations are a concern right now,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. “We really need to see corporate revenue growth.”\nThe main event for U.S. markets this week is likely to be the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting, the last before September, which still looms as the first possible date for an interest rate increase.\nTeva Pharmaceutical’s shares jumped 16.41 percent to a record high of $72.00 after it agreed to buy Allergan’s generic drug business for $40.5 billion, giving up on its bid to buy Mylan. Allergan rose 6.09 percent while Mylan fell 14.51 percent.\nFiat Chrysler fell 4.88 percent after a U.S. auto safety watchdog announced a $105 million fine against the automaker over lapses in safety recalls.\nOn the NYSE, 2.73 stocks fell for every one that rose. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered gainers 2.47 to 1.\nThe S&P 500 index posted 3 new 52-week highs and 58 lows; the Nasdaq Composite saw 21 new highs and 246 lows.\n 28, 2015 8:50 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T12:11:38.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
