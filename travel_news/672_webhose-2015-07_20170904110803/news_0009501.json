However, Operation Stack is only in place between junctions 8-11 coastbound on the M20.\nJunctions 12 and 13 are closed to assist in managing traffic in the area, rather than for queueing lorries. This is due to a high volume of freight traffic and continued disruption in Calais\nOnly tourist traffic for the Channel Tunnel is allowed to join at junction 11 .\nNon-freight traffic is currently being diverted onto the A20 from Junction 8 (Hollingbourne). This allows backed-up freight traffic to park on the coastbound carriageway of the M20.\nTourist traffic only from J11 on the M20 Credit: ITV Meridian Operation Stack is likely to have a knock-on effect and lead to increased congestion on the A20 as well as other local roads. Motorists are therefore asked to consider if their journeys are absolutely necessary, and if so whether alternative routes can be taken.\nWith delays possible, they are also advised to ensure they have sufficient provisions and consider the needs of vulnerable passengers including young children and the elderly.\nâ€“ Kent Police Last updated Wed 29 Jul 2015 Read more 22 updates Migrant dies as 1,500 try to enter Channel Tunnel Travel Sussex Kent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:04:16.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
