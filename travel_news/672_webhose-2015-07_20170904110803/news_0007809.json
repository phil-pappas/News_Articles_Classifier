Lucky visitors will be treated to a real feast of the local food and wine and hospitality that Romagna is famous for.The ancient city centre, including three grand piazzas, cobbled alleyways and terraces leading up to the great citadel, will all provide an atmospheric backdrop for a glorious party.Not only will guests be treated to world-class contemporary performance, including film, dance, theatre, installations and exhibitions, but they will also be able to enjoy the very best of Romagna's 0km cornucopia of great food and wine.And this year there is an extra special party! Just down the road by the Marecchia River a true global phenomenon has been taking shape where your preconceptions will be challenged further.Entering Mutonia is like visiting another world - a world where everything is used, and very little wasted.The Mutoids, an international group of artists and travelers, have created a new art tourism attraction sculpture park out of unwanted scrap in the heart of Italy.Here you will find metal creatures, large and small, dotted everywhere. All made out of scrap bits and some are even moving motorized monsters.The sculpture park is located on the banks of the Marecchia River just outside Santarcangelo.The site, a former gravel quarry, was offered to the travelling artists by the Lady Mayor of Santarcangelo after the Mutoids had performed at the Santarcangelo Festival in 1990.Saved from eviction from the site they have occupied for nearly 25 years by a 12,000 name petition and the support of the local council, the Mutoid's site has now been rescheduled as a tourism attraction.Even though the collective has little cash and is seeking support for the initiative - it has been confirmed that it will open with a major international exhibition called 'Vertigo Truth'\" \"At Vertigo Truth, language, research and different techniques will take shape: flags, banners, tapestries will mark the territory; assemblage and theatres will take place. Visionary artists will install giant wallpaintings and collages on in large and small spaces; artistic totems will rise to protect those who live here and in the world.\"The extraordinary installation will open at the Santarcangelo Festival 2015 - on 10 July and will remain in Mutonia during the summer.You can help support the Mutoids HERE on the 'Vertigo Truth'\" Facebook page.All this, and more will highlight the considerable steps that Santarcangelo (a Slow City) has made towards sustainability including the current programme - 'A Sustainable Present'This includes the elimination of bottled water - (24-hour sparkling and natural water on tap), cycle and car sharing, renewable energy, and high level, thought-through waste management.Further information: http://santarcangelofestival.com/ And an opportunity for journalists, bloggers, travel agents and tour operators to visit Romagna at festival-time HEREFree download of the latest Best of Romagna Magazine HERE More about BestofRomagna at: http://www.bestofromagna.com and http://www.Facebook.com/Bestofromagna Find out more about Romagna on a FAM trip HERE You've done the work now get the benefits - make your green destination visible HERE Valere Tjolle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:27:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
