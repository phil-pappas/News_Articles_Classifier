We entered from the west via the Burr Trail, a dirt road that plunges over the escarpment in a Zorro-worthy zigzag of switchbacks.\n\"There are two great canyons to hike up here,\" my friend told me, \"Upper and Lower Muley Twist. They're supposedly narrow enough to twist a mule.\"\nWe would have verified that curly claim right then and there, but we had the dog with us and domestic canines are banned from the national park trails.\nCapitol Reef has since become my favorite of Utah's five national parks. It includes the Waterpocket Fold, a 100-mile-long uplift capped with cliffs, carved with canyons and dotted with domes reminiscent of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Located off the main motorcoach routes, this park offers slickrock grandeur without the tourist loads commonly found in Zion, Bryce and Arches.\nLong and narrow, the park can be divided into three sections, the most popular of which is the Fruita District along Utah 24. The name honors the apple, apricot, cherry and peach orchards Mormon pioneers planted along the Fremont River. The trees remain, along with a restored schoolhouse, blacksmith shop, stone cabins and a homestead ranch.\nThe aptly named Scenic Drive offers intimate views of the park's signature reef of rock. The road ends at Capitol Gorge, which until the new highway arrived in the early '60s served as the route to and from Fruita. Now closed to traffic, it provides an easy canyon hike past an arch named for Butch Cassidy, who used this twisted terrain for a hideout.\nTo the north lies the Cathedral Valley District, the park's least visited section. Its normal access route requires fording the Fremont River, making high clearance a necessity and four-wheel drive a handy option. After crossing wide-open expanses, the road scales the Bentonite Hills, whose wind- and rain-sculpted topography comes painted in bold pastels ranging from rusty reds to graphite grays.\nBeyond lies the South Desert and Cathedral Valley, where monolithic towers of Entrada sandstone reminded park superintendents of Europe's gothic cathedrals. Spur roads and trails lead to overlooks, sink holes and a rock knob made of glass-like crystalline gypsum.\nCollared lizard on a rock in Lower Muley Twist Canyon, Capitol Reef National Park, near Torrey, Utah. ( Dan Leeth, Special to The Denver Post ) My favorite section of Capitol Reef is the Waterpocket Fold District, which follows the convoluted uplift to the south. Access comes on Notom-Bullfrog Road, which eventually ends at Powell Reservoir. Hikes along the way lead through slot canyons and up to stony amphitheaters, arches and natural bridges.\nOn our last trip to Capitol Reef, my wife and I drove to where the Burr Trail road bisects Muley Twist Canyon. We parked at the lower trailhead, donned hiking boots and, now totally dogless, headed downstream. I was finally going to do the Twist.\nThe route begins down a wide, sandy wash bounded by sandstone cliffs. While certainly not narrow enough to contort even the widest of mules, the canyon corridor gets tighter and deeper, its walls sculpted by wind and water. Gambel oak and the occasional cottonwood shade streamside benches dappled with yellow evening primrose blossoms.\nWe passed flood-carved alcoves and cliffs striped with black desert varnish. Lizards scampered across rocks. A skinny, rattle-free snake lay coiled in the sand, trying to warm itself in the sun. Ravens glided through bluebird skies and the descending notes of canyon wrens echoed from canyon walls. It was a sad moment when time came to turn around and head back.\nLower Muley Twist may lack the narrowness of Zion, the hoodoos of Bryce, the cliffs of Canyonlands or the sandstone arcs of Arches, but here at Capitol Reef we hiked for miles down a renowned canyon without encountering another human being. That's what makes this park special.\nDan Leeth is a travel writer/photographer; more at LookingForTheWorld.com.\nDianne Leeth hikes Lower Muley Twist Canyon in Capitol Reef National Park, near Torrey, Utah.
