JAMES TAMOU’S SHOT ON LILLYMAN\nWITH Queensland heading towards the 40-point mark, James Tamou snapped, hitting Queensland’s Jacob Lillyman across the face with a straight arm.\nIt got dirtier still as Tamou put in an uppercut for good measure as Lillyman crashed to the turf.\nHe was placed on report and will miss one game if he takes the early plea after being charged with a grade one striking.\nJames Tamou followed this stiff arm with an upper cut on Jacob Lillyman.

HOW DOES HE GET AWAY WITH IT?\nEVERYONE knows Blues hooker Mick Ennis is one of the great nigglers in rugby league.\nBut just what he says to the referees was on full display on Wednesday night, when he was clearly heard sledging the whistleblower.\n“You’re getting overwhelmed by the crowd, mate,” Ennis said.\nWhy do the refs cop that stuff?\nMick Ennis gets in the face of Justin Hodges.

CAM SMITH PRODUCES UNDER PRESSURE\nIN the headlines all week after Alex McKinnon’s controversial interview on 60 Minutes , Cam Smith left the controversy behind to produce yet another flawless display.\nOpting not to speak to Channel 9 after the final whistle, Smith finally broke his silence when he took the podium to raise the trophy for a ninth time.\n“To our boys, a lot of question marks were raised over our team and our performance after game two,” Smith said.\n“Looking at the scoreboard, [that] is the best way to respond.”\nHe later told Triple M he wanted to “have my say” on the McKinnon controversy but didn’t believe post-game was the time.\n“I don’t think this is the right time to talk,” Smith said. “I’ve just finished a State of Origin game and I obviously want to enjoy this victory but I think in the near future I’ll have to come out and have my say and hopefully everyone can hear that.\n“Obviously not the best of times over the last few days but I just want to concentrate on the victory tonight, I thought the guys were very good and I’m very proud of their efforts.”\nSmith was also upended by Beau Scott, who will sit out one NRL match if he pleads early after being charged with a grade one dangerous throw on the Maroons skipper.\nCam Smith led from the front for Queensland.

RECORD-BREAKING NIGHT\nTHE 52-6 scoreline set a new mark for largest winning margin, while Thurston’s nine goals were also a new Origin record.\nCam Smith also joined Darren Lockyer as the most capped player in Origin history, playing his 36th game for the Maroons.\nGreg Inglis was pretty much unstoppable.
