McCarroll and David Joshua Jennings on July 30th, 2015 If you decide to journey away from your homeland and out into the big world any time soon, you need to be aware that it is not just physical perils that may confront you – there are also a number of peculiar psychological disorders that attack those who decide to travel outside of their comfort zones.\nThis article, besides allowing the traveling reader to realize how special they are if they have never had to deal with any of these disorders, hopes to marginally expand the readers understanding of the often unacknowledged obstacles travelers must cope with on – as well as off – the road. Paris Syndrome Do you remember how empty and terrible you felt at around 11.30am on Christmas morning when the gifts were finally all unwrapped and grim reality set in? Now imagine you had to fly halfway around the world to get to Christmas, you couldn’t communicate with any of the grownups, and you weren’t sure if you were going to open boxes of toys or spiders. This, in a nutshell, is Paris Syndrome. “Paris Syndrome typically affects only Japanese tourists visiting Paris. It strikes roughly 20 victims each year, generally women in their mid-thirties.” Clinically speaking, Paris Syndrome is associated with delusions, hallucinations, persecution complexes, loss of connection to reality, anxiety, sweating, and increased heart rate/sex drive. Luckily (or unluckily if you happen to be from a certain Pacific Archipelago) Paris Syndrome typically affects only Japanese tourists visiting Paris. It strikes roughly 20 victims each year, generally women in their mid-thirties. Although the chances of any individual being stricken are small, the threat is deemed great enough for the Japanese embassy in Paris to maintain a twenty-four hour hotline for travelers on the edge.\nThe disorder was first identified by Professor Hiroaki Ota, a Japanese psychiatrist working in France. According to his 1998 article on the subject, found in the Journal of the Nissai Hospital, there are several main causes of the syndrome. The first is confusion, both linguistic and cultural. \nNot only is a sufferer unable to communicate with the French, but they are also unable to cope with the informality and rudeness of Parisian culture, as compared to the highly structured system of behavior in their home nation. Moreover, there is also an element of acute disappointment, as the tourist learns that the France created in his/her mind or by Japanese popular culture bears little resemblance to the real world. When these factors are compounded with the exhaustion from jet-lag, long bouts of sight-seeing, and being lost in a new city, the resulting manic state becomes far more understandable. \n>> Check out the most beautiful Metro stations in Paris Culture Shock Travel is fun, broadening and cool until suddenly, it just isn’t. The turning point could happen at any point in your travels; from disembarking in Heathrow and discovering they call the French fries something different, to realizing after several years of living in Korea that you really hate kimchi. For others, it’s the exact moment when their new significant other’s cute accent stops being exotic and ends up being annoying . Worst of all, perhaps the feeling is prompted by danger or betrayal, such as constant harassment or racism. “Out of all the conditions on the list, culture shock is by far the most common. Nearly every traveler has to cope with it at some point, although that certainly doesn’t make it seem any less dire.” Accompanying this turning point is a wave of emotions and clinical symptoms. Helplessness and loss of vigor are common, as is turning away from the host culture and resorting to stereotypes and/or eating at McDonald’s several times a week. Suffers are likely to feel irrational anger and often experience the sensation of being “tricked” or “seduced” by their host culture, as it often follows a period of intense love for a new place. Homesickness is often experienced, and – for those in bacteria-laden environments – real sickness, as depression knocks the immune system off-kilter.\nOut of all the conditions on the list, culture shock is by far the most common. Nearly every traveler has to cope with it at some point, although that certainly doesn’t make it seem any less dire. For those with the resources or the liberty to do so, the solution may be just simply to pop home for a bit and recharge one’s batteries. For others, the only solution is to work through it – although culture shock is no picnic, it’s often marks a transitional period between a superficial and a deeper understanding of a new home. \n>> Get tips for traveling in developing nations Reverse Culture Shock The world is an awfully big place and chances are, if you are a traveler, you find the rest of it a lot more interesting than your particular tiny corner of it. That’s commendable and can be the start of a seriously rewarding hobby or lifestyle, but most of us have to go home again. The problem with that is that sometimes home can feel stranger than the world out there . “The best thing to do is treat your home like a new place and let yourself adjust to it organically.” If you are suffering from any of the other conditions right now, this might be hard to believe, but eventually most travelers get used to the difficulties inherent in voyaging. After all, when you’re doing it in a foreign language, even asking where the bathroom is can be an accomplishment.\nReturning to a place where everything is easy and you know all the rules can seem an awful lot like quitting or losing your edge. Or worse, you might find that your time abroad has shown you the many flaws inherent in your own society. Maybe you’ll just find yourself waking up at 3am craving couscous with the knowledge that you have the whole Atlantic between you and the first decent plate. \nWhatever you feel in this situation, it’s extraordinarily important you don’t wallow in it. Although your friends and family back home are sure to thrill at your tales of life out there, no one wants to hear you lamenting how bad the Indian food here is, or catch you dismissing your home as uncultured or boorish. The best thing to do is treat your home like a new place and let yourself adjust to it organically. Maybe you’ll end up finding new things to love, and if not, you can start saving up for a new flight. \n>> Learn more about reverse culture shock Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Despite all the steps that cautious travelers take to ensure safety, there are many things that can go utterly and cataclysmically wrong. Even travelers in more settled areas of the globe cannot rule out dangerous situations arising; if there’s one thing the last ten years have shown, accidents, disasters, and political situations can affect anywhere, transforming a vacation into an exercise in survival. “Many sufferers report feelings of numbness and detachment, both towards the incident and towards their old lives. They may become listless or irritable, and find life to be impossible to cope with.” Yet for many, the real trials come after the terror, when the adrenaline wears off and the sheer implausibility of the situation reveals itself. Known as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD, a whole suite of behaviors and emotional reactions often develop in response to life or death situations. These symptoms can be flashbacks or reliving of the incident, either in dreams, uncontrollable memories or hallucinations, or in hyper-vigilant reactions to normal stimuli, such as taking evasive maneuvers at the sound of a dropped plate.\nMany sufferers report feelings of numbness and detachment, both towards the incident and towards their old lives. They may become listless or irritable, and find life to be impossible to cope with. In situations with loss of human lives, the survivors may become paralyzed with “Survivor’s Guilt,” and find themselves unable to rationalize why they, out of everyone lived through a disaster. People afflicted with PTSD have higher incidences of depression, alcoholism, and other related medical conditions. \nCertainly, PTSD is the most serious out of the entire list. Those suffering from symptoms, or indeed, who have been through any extraordinarily high stress situations, should seek professional help immediately. With an early diagnosis, strong social support, and prompt treatment, the US National Library of Medicine indicates a good chance of ameliorating or stopping the symptoms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:01:43.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
