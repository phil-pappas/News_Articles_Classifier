A foretaste of the processes involved in producing the book was given at a beach picnic and shore-side moutya on Sunday, July 19, at Mahe’s Chez Batista restaurant in the presence of many of the author’s sponsors and supporters, including Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture. \nLindy, sister of local singer, Joseph Samy, who has been living in Germany for much of the last 30 years, has never abandoned her Creole roots, especially when it comes to preparing delicious Creole cuisine for her foreign friends. This, over many years, has earned her a fine reputation as an excellent cook and, when she approached world-famous publisher Random House, they agreed to publish her work. \nThe Creole Touch, due out in October 2015, and which will be launched in Munich, Germany, is a pictorial adventure into the world of Seychellois Creole cuisine, from its roots until the present day. Supported by exquisite photographs from upcoming young Seychellois photographer, Marsha Dine, depicting aspects of Creole culture and a broad spectrum of local products, the Creole Touch provides readers with a mouth-watering collection of Creole dishes to prepare in their own homes against the kaleidoscopic background of Seychelles’ vibrant multi-ethnic culture. \n“It has always been my dream to be able to produce a book like this to raise the profile of my beloved Seychellois culture and also to bring the magical world of Creole cooking into my readers’ homes while providing them with a sense of context and history as well as an impression of my country’s phenomenal beauty,” enthused Lindy. \nThe 204-page book, which will appear in hardback, will be translated into German and Chinese to begin with, but considering the book’s potential appeal, is surely destined to appear in additional languages. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) . \nPHOTO: Author Lindy Scheele and Minister Alain St.Ange at Batista Creole Restaurant last Sunday Source: Seychelles Ministry of Tourism and Culture", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:10.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
