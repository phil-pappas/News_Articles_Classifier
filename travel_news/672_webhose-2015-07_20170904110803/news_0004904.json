'But I think the gear is not as important as the photographer.'\nBefore turning to aerial drone photography, Janulis sought raised locations to take pictures from, such as rooftops and hot air balloons - now he can speed up the process dramatically using his DJI Phantom 2 vision quadcopter to fly to hard-to-reach vantage points.\nPictured are show boats sailing across a picturesque lake by Trakai castle in Lithuania\n Next Parents of the Caribbean: The couple raising their toddler...
