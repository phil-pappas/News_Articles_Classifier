(Photo: Mark Ralston, AFP/Getty Images) \nA sweeping mountain view, eagles floating over a meandering river, elk wandering through an old Army fort — each entry into Yellowstone National Park makes a different first impression. \nThere’s no wrong way to enter the world’s first national park, but the entry can shape the experience. \nFrom Livingston, Mont., visitors follow the Yellowstone River through the Paradise Valley to the town of Gardiner and then Mammoth Hot Springs, known for its thermal terracing and resident elk herd. Visitors enter through a grand stone arch. \nFrom West Yellowstone, Mont., south of Bozeman, visitors are immediately in the park, following the Madison River and arriving near the geyser basins and Old Faithful. This West Gate is by far the most popular. \nFrom Red Lodge, Mont., south of Billings, visitors travel the Beartooth Highway, a spectacular winding road through high alpine landscapes, to Cooke City and then into the Lamar Valley in Yellowstone’s northeastern corner. \nWhat the Lamar Valley lacks in geyser features, it makes up for in wildlife. Known as the American Serengeti, the valley draws wildlife watchers from around the world, particularly those who want to see wolves. \nThe park’s south entrance is at its border with Grand Teton National Park. Moose Falls is just inside Yellowstone and marked with a tiny sign. It’s worth a stop and a popular (if chilly) swimming hole for those in the know. \nHayden Valley at Yellowstone National Park.

She loves the road over Sylvan Pass: “You get amazing views of the lake, and on most days you can see the Teton Mountains.” \nOnly the road across the top of the park, connecting Mammoth Hot Springs with Cooke City, is open year-round. The rest are closed from Nov. 1 to early May, depending on the weather. \nThe park has two loops forming a figure eight, which take visitors to the high points — Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Yellowstone Lake, Tower Falls and Mammoth Hot Springs. \nVisitors should give themselves time to travel the loops to see the big landmarks and to get off the beaten path for a more wild experience. One could explore Yellowstone for a lifetime and still find new things to see. \nKunkel worked in the park for two summers in college, which gave her the opportunity to hike — a lot. She’s logged more than 250 miles hiking in the park. She recommends that before people visit Yellowstone, they look at a park map and read a hiking guide to find the trail that’s most appealing to them, and then hit it. \n“A must is to get off the pavement,” Kunkel says. “If you only see what Yellowstone has to offer from your car or the boardwalk, you’re missing the point of how massive the Yellowstone ecosystem is. Even a 1-mile hike will put you into nature and away from the sounds of your fellow tourists, technology and civilization.” \nHer favorite hike was across the storied Specimen Ridge in Yellowstone’s northeast corner. \n“We covered 23 miles with a summit of Amethyst Mountain and swam, holding our packs above our heads, across a swollen, fast-moving Lamar River in one day,” she says. “In the backcountry, we ran across nearly every animal — deer, antelope, bighorn sheep, bison, elk and a massive 500-pound sow grizzly bear. It was a crazy, strenuous experience that I will never forget.” \nThe park changes by the season and the time of day. Those who don’t mind crowds go sightseeing from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Those who want to see wildlife explore at daybreak and in the evening. \n“If you go in the middle of the day in the middle of the summer you will spend most of your time in traffic,” Kunkel says. “If you do find yourself in the park during peak tourist season, choose to wake up early and go see the sights on your list. Or go out late at night. Plus, at sunrise and sunset, the animals are more active than the heat of the day.” \nA grizzly bear roams near Beaver Lake in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.

The weather is chancier, but spring means baby animals close to the road. Fall means bugling elk and clashing antlers. \n“I’ve been to Yellowstone more times than I can keep track of, and the best time of year, hands down, is the spring. When the bears are fresh out of hibernation, snow is melting, things are starting to green up,” she says. “You are guaranteed to see all the wildlife if you go in May or very early June. Visit Yellowstone in May or September. Go on off-peak travel to experience Yellowstone at a slow pace.” \nInbody also reports for the Great Falls (Mont.)
