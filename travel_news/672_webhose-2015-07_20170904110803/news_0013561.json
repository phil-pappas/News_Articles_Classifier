Inspirato is a luxury vacation club with over 10,000 members. \nEssentially the company manages and controls 300 global luxury destinations, David Kallery of Inspirato tells TheStreet's Jill Malandrino that the key is the level of service from the concierge team that separates the company from other destination competitors. \nMust Read: 11 Safe High-Yield Dividend Stocks for Times of Volatility and Uncertainty \nIn fact, American Express ( AXP - Get Report ) partnered with Inspirato. \nKallery says the top luxury destinations include Tuscany, Italy, Mexico, Hawaii and the summer always draws the luxury consumer to Nantucket , Mass., and Sea Island, Ga. \nInspirato is competitive with the likes of Airbnb , VRBO or any of the listing sites in the curation of the homes. \nIn fact, Inspirato will put another $50,000 to $75,000 of upgrades into the homes in the portfolio and the homes will never be found on a listing site as the homes and level of service fits the curation model. \nKallery explains even luxury travel customers seek value too. Leasing vacation properties (rather than owning), keeps membership fees lower than traditional destination clubs. \nEven in this on-demand environment, Kallery says there is still plenty of growth in the luxury travel industry . Areas of focus include the West Coast in the U.S., Hawaii and the Caribbean. \nLuxury travel customers are looking to experience things off the beaten path and this is why vacationing in curated homes brings a local flavor.
