The two remaining slots can be used to serve either Dublin or Belfast. The EC will decide on which airline receives the slots.\nIreland’s minister for transport Paschal Donohoe welcomed the commission’s approval. He suggested that once it was confirmed it would have no effect on the connectivity commitments, the State would formally accept IAG’s offer.\nDenmark strikes\nRyanair has said it will move its base in Copenhagen to Kaunas in Lithuania after trade unions said they would go ahead with strike action over working conditions.\nThe Irish carrier also warned it may close its Billund base in Denmark today if planned strikes at the airport go ahead.\nThe unions want a Danish collective agreement for Ryanair’s staff and last month won a court ruling allowing them to take industrial action.\nIf it presses forward with the transfer, Ryanair will not have any bases in Denmark meaning any strike action will be illegal.\nThe no-frills carrier said it will continue to operate flights to and from Denmark but without any Danish collective agreement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-17T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:53:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
