Her workshop hummed gently with the sound of industry as sewing machinists pieced together kites at lightning speed. The period between May and October was quiet for her business and for the 86 other workshops like hers dotted around the community of Wangjiazhuangzi in Weifang, a city in the eastern coastal province of Shandong. “At peak season, this workshop makes 10,000 kites a day. One worker can make between 400 and 600 kites a day,” said Ms Sun. The 39-year-old, who runs the Dashan Kite Factory, was a machinist for two years before starting her own business.

At the beginning I was very nervous because I started from nothing and I didn’ t know how to communicate with customers.” Her rise from shop floor to self-employment has proved lucrative. Last year, her factory had sales of 1.5 million yuan (£154,400). Sales for the first six months of this year totalled 2 million yuan. “The reason for my success? It’s the quality of my products. I am also very humble.” Most of her kites are for domestic use, with only about 20 per cent destined for export. The reason for my success? It’s the quality of my products. I am also very humble The 87 workshops, covering an area of a few square miles, make 80 million kites a year between them. About 2,200 of the 4,600 people who live in Wangjiazhuangzi are in the kite business. There is more to kitemaking in Weifang than the industrialised process seen in Wangjiazhuangzi. The tradition stretches further back than a longtou wugong (a dragon-headed centipede kite) — more than 2,000 years. A philosopher named Mo Di, who lived on Lushan Mountain near Weifang, is said to have spent three years making a flying wooden bird. He later passed his knowledge and skills on to his student Lu Ban, who used a lighter material and kept his creation in the air for three days. Families of the Yang Clan in Yangjiabu, a small town in Weifang, started to make kites in the early years of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Villagers transferred the techniques of making woodblock pictures to kitemaking. By the Qianlong reign (1736-1795) of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), kitemaking had become an important industry in Weifang. To preserve and promote this aspect of the city’s cultural heritage and identity, Weifang has an annual international kite festival that launched in 1984 and attracts thousands of people from around the world, as well as a kite museum of 86,000 square feet. China has three other kite cities: Beijing, Tianjin and Nantong in Jiangsu province. Swallow-shaped kites are popular in Beijing, while whistle kites are associated with Nantong. In China, kites were used for communication, military purposes and measuring distances.
