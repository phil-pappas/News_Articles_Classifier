We’d prefer that your spinning head result from rock-bottom discounts, too much local beer and so many unforgettable memories, you’ll wonder why you never thought to visit here in September before now. \n1. Visit Belize in September if the idea of a non-stop party that spans all 30 days of the month is something you’ve always wanted to experience. Even the Christmas and New Year’s holidays pale in comparison. Belize finally gained its independence on September 21st, thus that date serves as an annual anniversary party that triggers fireworks, bands, parades and pageants. You’re invited to attend as many of these celebrations as your energy level permits if you visit in September. \n2. September in Belize has especially nice weather, with temperatures running between 77- and 86-degrees F. Sure, Belize remains temperate and beautiful nearly 365 days a year, but September is the tail end of the green season, when Mother Nature grows weary of dispensing life-sustaining rain. In September, showers typically arrive late at night or in the early morning hours—before anyone in their right mind gets up after partying late into the night before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:45:23.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
