They include Denpasar to Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Narita (Tokyo), Kansai (Osaka) and Seoul. \n\nDomestic services are hit too, with flights between Denpasar and Jakarta, Surabaya, Jogjakarta, Labuan Bajo being disrupted. Lombok-Surabaya and Denpasar-Surabaya services have grinded to a halt. \nBali Hotels Association (BHA), which represents more than 130 hotels in Bali, has released guidelines to ease the burdens of travellers affected by the eruption. “For passengers who need to extend their stay, the Best Available Rate should be proposed when requests are made directly to the hotel. For bookings that are made through a third party, contracted rates apply. “For passengers that cannot come to Bali or will arrive later than original dates booked, BHA members are recommended to accept, at no charge, to re-book their stay (based on availability and rates during new requested period) until end of 2015,” the guideline reads. Jean-Charles Le Coz, vice-chairman of BHA, said: “Bali Hotels Association looks forward to a better situation that will allow all travellers to enjoy their trip to and from the island in a non-disruptive environment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:04:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
