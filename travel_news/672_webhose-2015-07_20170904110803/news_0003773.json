Mr Frost is believed to have collapsed during a run at the family’s holiday home in Oxfordshire on Sunday. Friends said he had appeared fit and healthy and was in “great form” over the past few weeks, with no signs of any health problems. His father Sir David died of a heart attack aged 74 two years ago on board the Queen Elizabeth cruise liner. His family has paid tribute to him, describing how he became \"leader of the pack\" after his father died. Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard told the Evening Standard : “Miles quite simply was born an old soul. And everybody was drawn to his wisdom, love, loyalty and laughter.” Brothers George, 28, and Wilfred, 29, said: “Miles was the kindest and most generous brother we could have wished for. \"Since Dad died he was the leader of our pack. Everyone who Miles met immediately fell in love with his warmth, selflessness and incredible sense of humour. He has gone far too soon and is so undeserving of this.” The family of the late Sir David Frost, wife Lady Carina Frost (2ndR) and sons Miles, Wilfred and George (Getty) Mr Frost, the eldest son of TV legend Sir David and his wife Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard, was a founding partner of private equity group Frost Brooks. He and his two brothers, Wilfred, 29, and 28-year old George, were educated at Eton College. “Miles was a wonderful eldest son who was very well loved by all his friends and family,” Lord Chadlington, a family friend of the Frosts told the Daily Mail. “This is a terrible shock. I had breakfast with him last Thursday and he was in great form. There was no signs that anything was wrong. It just underscores the fragility of life. “There will be a post mortem examination but all we know is that he collapsed while jogging. “The Frost family are extremely close and they will all miss him terribly, as we all will. It is hard to lose a loved one at any age, but 31 really is difficult to comprehend.” • Great and good gather for Sir David Frost memorial • Inside Sir David Frost's former home Mr Frost was said to have socialised with friends on Friday without any indications of ill health and appeared at a charity cricket match two weeks ago. One friend said that his death “appears to have come out of nowhere”, adding: “Miles was in great form recently and seemed really fit and well. It’s a terrible shock and everybody feels desperately sorry for his mother and brothers. He was a wonderful man who has gone far too early.” Mr Frost, a keen athlete, had previously run a half marathon in the Lewa Game Reserve in Kenya, regarded as one of the hardest long distance challenges because of the heat and high altitude. Prince William was said to have been hoping to run the 2013 race with him but he was unable to because the Duchess of Cambridge was due to give birth to Prince George around that time. Mr Frost helped lead prayers at last year’s memorial service for his father, who made his name in the 1960s on the BBC’s late night satirical series That Was The Week That Was. He went on to present The Frost Report , and The Frost Programme in the 1970s, to Frost on Sunday in the 1990s. At the height of his fame during the 1960s, Frost had a reputation for aggressive and fearless interviewing. • Sir David Frost - obituary His interview with Rupert Murdoch on the subject of pornography was considered so hostile that it was said to have contributed to Murdoch’s decision not to live in Britain. Sir David also stood his ground against Enoch Powell in an interview on the subject of racism. He interviewed six American Presidents, eight British Prime Ministers, several members of the Royal family and a galaxy of celebrities. A poll in 1969 revealed that he was, after the Queen and the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, the best-known person in the country. He had been due to interview Prime Minister David Cameron in the week that he died. Sir David was travelling alone in August 2013 when he had a heart attack on board the Cunard liner, where he was due to give a speech.
