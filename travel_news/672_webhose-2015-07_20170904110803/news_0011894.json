Today I found relief by smearing my neck and forehead (the affected areas) with live yoghurt. What do other people do when this extremely itchy and unsightly rash afflicts them ? By the way, about ten days ago, I also had a rash (on my cheeks) which was not prickly heat. It was more like hives, with raised white welts, which I attributed to a spider bite. I cured it with aloe vera and a lot of cool showers and staying in the shade. Today it is around 40 degrees here and I don't have A/C. I am drinking lots of water and not running around. <<Tehzeeb se bolo / Izzat muft milegi >> [Speak (to others) with decency / (you will get) respect for free.]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:51:24.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
