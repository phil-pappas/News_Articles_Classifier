We have only ever cruised with P&O, and this year are going with my parents so that they can have one child in their cabin! However, next year we will have been married 10 years in July and would like to go on a cruise just the five of us. Which ships are able to accommodate us in a standard cabin? Jane Archer, cruise expert, writes Start with Disney Cruise Line ( disneycruiseline.co.uk ). Not only do all cabins on Disney ships hold five passengers, but Disney Magic will be sailing from the UK next summer, so you can avoid flying. The ship has Mickey, Minnie and other characters on board, and also Disney films and shows. There are swimming pools, waterslides, clubs for youngsters aged 3-12, and a nursery for children under three years, so you and your husband can enjoy time alone to celebrate your anniversary. A one-week cruise to the Norwegian fjords round-trip from Dover departing May 29 (Whitsun half-term), costs from £6,136 for the five of you. In July, a voyage from Dover to Barcelona departing July 25 costs from £7,808. Flights are extra. Carnival Vista, a Carnival Cruise Lines ( carnival.co.uk ) ship, is launching next year and spending the summer in the Med. It has family cabins for up to five, children’s clubs, waterslides, a ropes course and cinema. An eight-night Mediterranean cruise round-trip from Barcelona departing July 29 2016, costs from £3,199 for five in a deluxe ocean view cabin excluding flights. A family harbour cove suite costs from £4,779. Ask the experts Our Q&A service allows you can pick the brains of our experts at home and abroad. Email your query to asktheexperts@telegraph.co.uk .
