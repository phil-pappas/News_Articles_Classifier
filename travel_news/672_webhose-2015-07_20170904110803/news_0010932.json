If you want to take a landing tour, you'll need to depart from Las Vegas and fly to the West Rim. There are some amazing tours available for the South Rim too, but those are all air-only since helicopters cannot land in that part of the canyon. A Fantastic Landing Tour Not everyone who visits the Grand Canyon will go below the rim, but if you choose the deluxe champagne picnic option then you can join the ranks of the few who have enjoyed this unique experience. It's one of the most popular tours, and in addition to giving you spectacular views of the Grand Canyon, you'll also get to see the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead from the air. Then when you get to the canyon, your chopper flies down to the bottom and lands by the Colorado River. Besides the picturesque champagne picnic, the tour can be upgraded to allow for a Colorado River boat ride. This allows for some spectacular views of the impressive rock walls and the river basin. This air tour runs all day from sunrise to sunset, and the sunset tour is particularly beautiful. The setting sun causes shadows to dance along the canyon floor, and it creates a stunning visual experience. These air tours come with other upgrades too, such as a second stop at the top of the canyon. Here you can step out on the one of a kind Skywalk that puts you on a glass platform 4000ft above the river below. You can't beat a Grand Canyon tour that gives you an aerial view of the canyon, a thrilling descent flight to the canyon floor, and an adventure walk on the Skywalk all on the same trip. Departing On Your Tour The air tours that take off from Vegas use a helipad on the Vegas Strip or an airfield in Boulder City. Boulder City is a 30 minute taxi ride from Vegas, and offers the regular tour packages. If you upgrade to a deluxe tour, you get to take off from a more convenient location on the Vegas Strip. You'll even be transported to and from your hotel in a complementary limousine. Another advantage to deluxe tours is they use EcoStar 130 helicopters. These helicopters have roomy cabins with stadium-style seats, so there are no obstructed views through the massive panoramic windshield. In addition to the improved helicopter, deluxe tours also include a flyover of the Las Vegas Strip. If you're taking a sunset tour then this little addition is a nice bonus. You can watch Vegas spring to life as it lights up the darkened sky. Buy Your Tour In Advance All helicopter tours from Vegas are extremely popular, especially ones that land at the canyon, so they fill up fast. Plan on booking your tour two weeks in advance or sooner. I generally recommend that people book as soon as they've confirmed their accommodation. That way you won't have to worry about the tour being filled up when you're ready to go. Book online to get the best deals, because this will allow you to bypass hefty agent fees. You'll get the best price, with the convenience of booking online and receiving an early confirmation. Summary I've provided this information to help people like you get the most from their Grand Canyon helicopter tour. Keep in mind, you can only take a landing tour at the West Rim, and all these depart from Vegas. The champagne picnic tour is one of the most popular and you should consider booking it if you can. Remember to buy your tour online where you can save up to 35 percent off the cost, because that makes it affordable to upgrade your tour to include fun adventures at the canyon. \n  incredible South Rim helicopter tours and these awesome flights that depart from fabulous Las Vegas: http://www.grandcanyonhelicopters.org/papillon-helicopters/las-vegas/   04 Jul   162  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:40:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
