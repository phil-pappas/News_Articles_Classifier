LifeProof’s FRE Power case for iPhone 6.\nA phone case that’s waterproof, dirtproof, snowproof and shockproof with an integrated battery charger that allows your phone to get two times the battery life? It’s all possible with LifeProof’s FRE Power case. Able to be submersed for 2 meters for one hour, survive dirt and dust (and sand), block snow and ice, and survive drops from 2 meters — it may not be Superman, but it’s a super case. When you forget to charge it, no need to plug into the wall or an external battery. Just flip the switch and get a jolt of energy to extend the journey. An optical-glass lens and Sound Enhancement System ensures your photos are nothing less than stellar and you never have to endure sub-optimal beats. To top it off, the case isn’t much larger than the LifeProof case without the battery charger. LifeProof’s FRE Power case for iPhone 6.
