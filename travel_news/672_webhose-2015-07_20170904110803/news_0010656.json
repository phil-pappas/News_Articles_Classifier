However, we will continue to urge the Government to conduct a full impact assessment of APD, leading to significant reductions. That is the only way to make sure the whole of the UK has a fair and competitive rate of APD.\"\nThe chief executive of The British Air Transport Association, Nathan Stower, said he was disappointed that APD was not properly addressed in yesterday's Budget and a \"big opportunity\" had been missed.\n\"With the Scottish Government committed to halving APD following devolution of the tax, followed by full abolition, the status quo is going to become economically and politically unsustainable,\" said Stower.\n\"The scope is too narrow and the three options for discussion are fundamentally flawed. The Treasury must also consider a significant reduction and abolition of APD across the UK if this review of options is to be credible.\"\nIn April APD changes came into force which meant cheaper long-haul flights. The changes, announced in last year’s Budget , saw the two highest rates – bands C and D – abolished.\nBand C affects people travelling over 4,000 miles and Band D affects people travelling over 6,000 miles", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/discussion-paper-on-options-for-supporting-english-regional-airports-from-the-impacts-of-air-passenger-duty-devolution"], "published": "2015-07-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:51:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
