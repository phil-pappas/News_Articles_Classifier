Among the thousands of titles available, are the historic photos and books about St. James. Library hours are 10-5 Mon. - Tues., 10-2 Wed, 10-6 Thurs. - Fri., and 10-2 Sat . 2.St. James United Methodist Church This is the oldest established congregation in St. James. Built in 1860 by William James as a congregation and meeting hall, it was purchased by the Methodists in the late 30’s. Interestingly, Lucy Wortham James asked, in her will, that the James Foundation buy back the church if the Methodists didn’t want it and restore the four clock faces it was meant to have on the steeple. 3.Maramec Spring and the Iron Works This is the 5th largest natural spring in the Mo. Ozarks. Thomas James acquired the spring and 10,000 acres to build an iron mine and foundry west of the Mississippi. The ruins remain today and are part of a 2,000 acre park that is open to the public for visitation. There is a daily entry fee to enter the park from mid-Feb.-Oct. Annual passes may be purchased at the park. Call 573-265-7387 for more information. 4.Trinity Episcopal Church Built in 1893, Lucy James had Norman style stone added to the exterior in 1927. Most notable about the church are its stained glass windows, especially the north window. It was made by a 600 year old London Company in memory of Robert Graham Dun, the uncle James inherited her fortune from. Part of the window is shown in the Leader-Journal’s masthead this week. 5. The train depot Originally built by the Frisco Railroad around 1880, the depot was fully restored by local citizens and the St. James Chamber of Commerce. The first train came through St. James July 4, 1860 and locals know, the train still comes right through the center of town. Currently the train depot is a popular local venue for events and parties. Individuals interested in renting the depot can call City Hall at 573-265-7013.
