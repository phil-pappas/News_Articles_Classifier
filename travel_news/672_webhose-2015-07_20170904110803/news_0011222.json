When first elected New Jersey Governor in 2009, he was seen as someone—large and direct—who could effectively tackle the state’s fiscal challenges, and maybe someday the nation’s. Since then, his popularity has waned amidst speculation of corruption , nepotism , misuse of funds and bridge closings, as has New Jersey’s economy, marked by credit downgrades and declining incomes. This has raised doubts about Christie’s leadership abilities, which may grow once voters notice his record in Atlantic City.\nOver Christie’s tenure, the once-renowned casino and beach hub has rapidly declined in the wake of several misfortunes. One was the millions in damages brought by Hurricane Sandy, and the other was the deregulation of gambling in neighboring states, which chipped away at the city’s longtime east coast monopoly. This has brought Atlantic City, which always had a cyclical, tourism-dependent economy anyway, to its knees. The city lost 10,000 casino jobs between 2003-2013, and since 2006, has seen a 50% decrease in slot machine and table game revenue. It has 15.4% unemployment and 34% poverty.\nOf course, outside events like these were beyond Christie’s control. But a good response might have been for the Governor to encourage a more economically diverse Atlantic City. After all, it has always been oddly-located for a tourist haven. Because Atlantic City has cold weather, it has a limited season for hanging around the beach and boardwalk. And because distance traveling has become so much cheaper, the casino- and beach-towns further south are now that much more accessible for vacationing Yankees. But Christie’s response to these troubles has been to double down on tourism, by subsidizing entertainment options beyond just casinos. In the process, he has embraced a public redevelopment model that has grown increasingly unsuccessful nationwide.\nThis began in 2010, when Christie seized control of Atlantic City’s casino and entertainment districts from the city government, hoping to turn it into “Las Vegas East.” He increased the power of the state-run, governor-appointed Casino Reinvestment Development Authority to manage the boardwalk, marina, beachfront and casinos, hoping to bring improved cleanliness and public safety. Currently, the agency takes a percentage of the profits from casinos, and redistributes them towards other developments.\nSo what have been some of the authority’s actions?\nMost noted was the Revel Casino failure, a story documented last year by Forbes . The casino was already struggling and half-built when Christie entered office, and JP Morgan had decided to take a $1 billion loss rather than complete it. So Christie offered $261 million in tax incentives to lure further investors, and the CRDA seized dozens of private properties through eminent domain around Revel for a nearby mixed-use development. The Revel opened in 2012, but closed permanently within two years.\nThe CRDA has also floated $241 million in bonds to help finance a $110 million repair to the city’s convention center and its arena, Boardwalk Hall. The convention center has long underperformed for the reason that others do—because practically every city has subsidized one, causing a nationwide surplus. It is unlikely that repairs will change this situation in Atlantic City.\nBecause some airlines have stopped flying to Atlantic City, Christie decided to subsidize that too. After United Airlines cancelled some services last year, Christie told the press that he wanted from the company “a deeper explanation than the one I have gotten so far, which is none.” This was despite CRDA creating a $5 million grant designed to attract more flights to the city. Less than 1% of Atlantic City’s visitors arrive by air.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-corruption-of-bipartisanship/392318/", "http://watchdog.org/140568/christie-reform-disguise/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-10-29/christie-failing-economy-promise-as-new-jersey-falls-behind-us", "http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/improving-underperforming-atlantic-city-convention-center-key-to-economic-recovery/article_66157a94-e0a9-11e4-8abb-07ede2346c8e.html", "http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/press/atlantic/atlantic-city-airport-taken-over-by-port-authority/article_af34df48-13f4-51c5-a361-3097b96bf45c.html", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/chris-christies-nothing-left-to-lose-campaign-119521.html", "http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/new-ballroom-tops-list-of-a-c-convention-center-upgrades/article_a9c0f31e-e22e-11e4-b7c8-8b67077b9ff7.html", "http://www.njspotlight.com/stories/14/11/12/atlantic-city-summit-charting-a-future-for-the-economically-challenged-community/", "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/07/nj_gambling_atlantic_city_takeover_meadowlands_racetrack_shut.html", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/37607032/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/chris-christie-loses-a-big-atlantic-city-bet-posting-another-challenge-for-2016-run/2014/09/05/d7471a7a-33b0-11e4-8f02-03c644b2d7d0_story.html", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/22/chris-christie-hit-over-atlantic-city-takeover-and-family-connections/", "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/09/atlantic_city_casinos_falling_revenue_christie_tourism_district.html", "http://articles.philly.com/2014-07-01/news/50949297_1_revel-casinos-atlantic-city-alliance"], "published": "2015-07-01T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:30:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
