The verified airport footprint forms the baseline measure to which future activities and reduction targets will be aligned.\nCommenting on the accreditation, Ahmad Al Haddabi, Chief Operations Officer at Abu Dhabi Airports, said that, environmental impact was directly linked to the operational efficiency of Abu Dhabi International Airport.\n“We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to have a positive effect on the local and global environment, whilst operating more effectively,” he said.\nAirport Carbon Accreditation is an independent programme administered by WSP Environment and Energy, an international consultancy appointed by ACI EUROPE to enforce the accreditation criteria for airports on an annual basis.\nRelated Posts Abu Dhabi International Airport upgrades Baggage Handling Systems Etihad Airways celebrates arrival of inaugural Alitalia flights from Venice And Milan MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
