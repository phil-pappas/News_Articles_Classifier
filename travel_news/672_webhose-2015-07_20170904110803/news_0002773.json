Hundreds of people will join Welcome to Yorkshire for a sparkling ceremony on Monday 9th November, celebrating the very best in Yorkshire tourism. \nEntries for this year’s awards are now closed and the competition is looking stronger than ever. Colin Mellor, head of judges, said: “Every year, the field of entries seems to get stronger and stronger, and this year’s awards are certainly no exception. “We have a record number of entries, almost a third of which are first time entrants, which is a real testament to the prestige of the White Rose Awards.” This year’s awards will once again include a gala dinner, amazing entertainment, as well as a line-up of very special guests. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said: “The first direct arena has quickly established itself as one of the best venues for entertainment in Europe, so to be having this year’s White Rose Awards in a setting where some of world’s greatest music stars have rocked out is a really exciting prospect. “The past twelve months or so have, without doubt, been some of the finest in Yorkshire’s long history but the foundations of this county’s success lie in its businesses and business owners. A glittering event at one of Europe’s best venues is the perfect way to say thank you to those people who have made Yorkshire what it is today.” Welcome to Yorkshire’s White Rose Awards are over a quarter of a century old and each year they honour the best and brightest of the county’s tourism businesses in 16 categories, ranging from Small Visitor Attraction to Restaurant with Rooms to Outstanding Customer Service.
