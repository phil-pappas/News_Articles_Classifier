Last month, it recommended a third runway at Heathrow be built with Cameron promising a decision before the end of 2016.\n“Now is the time for government decision and action,” the letter says. “Your Government must support UK businesses by implementing the Airports Commission’s recommendation and expand Heathrow.\n“The choice the Prime Minister faces is clear - action on Heathrow is the only way to secure Britain’s future as a powerhouse in the global economy, whilst doing nothing will put Britain’s economy in a perilous position.”\nHeathrow CEO John Holland Kaye said: “The prime minister showed leadership in establishing an independent Airports Commission. It unanimously concluded that expanding Heathrow is the best way of securing Britain’s future as a powerhouse in the global economy.\n\"Now the Prime Minister has the opportunity to show he is serious about delivering Britain’s long-term economic plan by listening to businesses from across the UK and backing Heathrow expansion. This debate has never been about a runway – it is about the future of our country. Let’s get on with it.”\nLast week , Gatwick described the Airports Commission’s decision to recommend expansion at Heathrow as “flawed”.\nOutlining the airport’s first detailed response since the report was published, chair of Gatwick’s board Roy McNulty said the Commission’s analysis “fell short” in a number of key areas.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.gatwickobviously.com/sites/default/files/downloads/lgw_initial_reponse_to_the_ac_report_14.07.15.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-20T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:32:40.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
