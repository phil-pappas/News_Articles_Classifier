Each company is struggling to build profits in the face of declining downloads — and is lobbying for a better balance between free and paid services, sources said.\nThe labels know a radical move like removing all their content is fraught with danger as users may simply, and quickly, post their own videos.\nWhere will be go for our Tay Tay fix? Source: YouTube\nThe move to squeeze more ad revenue from their videos picked up steam last week when YouTube parent Google revealed that, in the second quarter, time spent viewing YouTube grew 60 per cent — the largest uptick in two years — and that the time spent viewing YouTube on mobile devices more than doubled from a year ago.\nGoogle Chief Business Officer Omid Kordestani told investors, “The number of advertisers running video ads on YouTube is up more than 40 per cent [compared to a year ago] and, for our top 100 advertisers, the average spend per advertiser is up over 60 per cent year-over-year.”\nMorgan Stanley estimates that YouTube revenue in 2015 will rise to $US6.6 billion ($A8.97 billion), up 38 per cent from 2014.\nBut the labels are not seeing anywhere near as robust an increase in their piece of the ad revenue take.\nThey have little idea, for example, how lucrative Psy’s Gangnam Style (viewed 2.4 billion times) or Carly Rae Jepsen’s Run Away With Me (the No. 3 Vevo video on YouTube this week, with 1.6 million views) are when it comes to ad dollars.\n“They control everything: ad policy, the sales channel, monetisation,” said one music industry exec. “They are one of the worst partners, and it’s a great source of frustration.”\nIndustry body RIAA says ad-supported streaming services (both visual and audio) contributed just $US295 million ($A401 million) in 2014 to the US record industry — with YouTube’s contribution estimated to be about half that number.\nYouTube made Korean pop star Psy a bona fide global celebrity. Source: AP\nGoogle execs have said that YouTube has paid out billions of dollars to the music industry over the last few years and that partner revenue has increased 50 per cent year on year the last three years in a row.\nGoogle has a subscription service, Music Key. Launched last November, it is still in beta.\n“[Music Key] is a giant head-fake,” one exec said.\nA YouTube spokesman said the service will launch this year and was in beta “to improve the product” ahead of its debut.\nThis article originally appeared on New York Post .\nOriginally published as Massive change coming to YouTube", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/07/22/music-labels-weigh-yanking-youtube-videos-over-ad-money/", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/844772-1e74c048-31a6-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/why-youtube-as-you-know-it-might-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past/story-fn5lic6c-1227455845185", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/24/1227455/844744-000e1b54-31a6-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:51:56.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
