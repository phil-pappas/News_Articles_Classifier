Working closely with airlines to build demand for routes is a key priority for Tourism Ireland and this new flight will certainly provide a welcome boost for both business and leisure travel to Cork and the South of Ireland from the all-important British market.\nNiall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The introduction of this new CityJet flight is really good news and will certainly help boost both leisure and business travel from Britain to Cork and the South of Ireland in 2015. We look forward to working closely with CityJet to maximise the promotion of the new flight.
