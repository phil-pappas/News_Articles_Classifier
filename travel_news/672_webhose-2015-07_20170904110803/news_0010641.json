In a statement, the low-cost carrier said the milestone coincides with Jetstar Asia’s move of its operations to the klia2 terminal in Kuala Lumpur on July 8.\nChan Kim Wah, a Malaysian national who works in Singapore, has won himself a RM1,000 flight voucher for being the 2.5 millionth passenger to travel between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\nAfter launching with one daily service in 2008, Jetstar Asia now operates up to 30 weekly services and continues to enhance the travel experience for thousands of passengers who fly between Singapore and the Malaysian capital each year.\nMarking the celebration in Kuala Lumpur, Jetstar Asia Chief Executive Officer Bara Pasupathi said that demand for the route has continued to grow due to the strong business and cultural ties between the two countries.\n“Singapore travellers love visiting Kuala Lumpur and our commitment to low fares has made more frequent trips for business meetings as well as great food and shopping more affordable.\n“The recent opening of Southeast Asia’s largest factory outlet malls less than two kilometres from the klia2 terminals will serve as new attractions for shopping-savvy Singaporean travellers to visit Kuala Lumpur more often,” he said.\nThe malls are part of the KLIA Aeropolis, also known as Malaysia Airports’ airport city master plan.\nMeanwhile, Malaysia Airports Senior General Manager of Operations Services, Datuk Azmi Murad, said: “Airports are no longer just transit points but a destination in their own right.\n“klia2 is a shopping destination with a total of 225 retail and FB outlets throughout the terminal and nearly 200 retail and F&B outlets at gateway@klia2, a shopping annexe to the terminal which aims to cater not only to travellers but to the surrounding community as well.\n“We are delighted to welcome Jetstar Asia to the klia2 terminal today. They are joining an increasing number of airlines that recognise klia2 as an exciting, vibrant and convenient terminal especially in terms of its seamless connectivity and world-class facilities.”\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
