This week hinged on a day trip to central London just two days after the V70 was delivered. It was the perfect car for the adventure, loaded up as we were with my toddler, wife, parents and a whole heap of gear. The enormous boot swallowed whatever we chucked at it, and the powerful yet frugal D5 turbo-diesel engine made motorway driving a joy. To recover from the shock of our day in the big city, we spent the rest of the week driving locally. During this time, the V70 consolidated its position as a much-admired addition to the household.

What was the average mpg? We clocked up more than 500 miles in the car, though it didn’t feel as many as that. Take our trip to London as a case in point. We drove from 10am to 2pm, with a quick stop halfway to drop my son at his auntie’s house. Then, at 5pm, we turned around and retraced our steps. It was a long day, during which we battled countless traffic jams, including an hour-long tailback around Hyde Park. Yet, by the time I pulled into the driveway at home, I barely felt as if I’d driven anywhere. That’s a testament to the V70’s ease of use. As for fuel economy, we achieved a satisfying 42mpg during a week of mixed driving. What most surprised you about this car? The fuel economy was better than I anticipated from a powerful car with an automatic gearbox, showing that you can enjoy this combination without bleeding the pumps dry. Apart from that, I was reminded of just how crisp the V70 is to drive. Given its generous proportions, you might expect something that feels wallowy and imprecise, but nothing could be further from the truth. It’s a sharp performer, this one. What piece of technology did you most appreciate on the car? No doubt about this: Blind Spot Information System (BLIS). Driving around unfamiliar streets in London, and changing lanes with a frequency that caused my dad no small amount of panic, this device was a godsend. Yes, I still had to keep my wits about me as cars whizzed past on either side. But to know that my blind spot was clear before pulling out significantly reduced my stress levels, and helped me avoid countless confrontations with angry cab drivers. Maybe Boris Johnson should buy a Volvo? What impact did this car have on your driving? It made me a much better urban driver, for the reasons outlined above. But the real impact was that it made progress much smoother, courtesy of the seamless automatic transmission. This came into its own during the Hyde Park hold-up, where clutch control would have soon become tiresome. Not only was it easier for me, but it meant the car edged forward in traffic jams with a calm elegance that befits its classy styling. What’s good about this car from a business driver’s perspective? If you’re a basic-rate taxpayer, you can have this V70 as your company car for a Benefit in Kind tax cost of just £188 per month. For that, you get a practical family holdall that drives like a dream, has a great image, and offers unrivalled comfort and safety. Not a bad proposition, I would say. Did anything unusual happen while you had the car? I’d bagged a parking space in a private courtyard in the heart of Westminster. And, accustomed as I am to arriving in such places behind the wheel of my clapped-out old banger, I was taken aback to be treated with a degree of respect by the security guard. I think he may even have called me “sir”, which I can only ascribe to the V70’s classy appearance. What did your family make of the car? If you really want to test a family’s enthusiasm for a car, go five-up for an eight-hour road trip and see what they make of it at the end of the day. I’m pleased to say that, as our marathon journey came to a close, the Gibsons gave the V70 a definite thumbs-up. “More Volvo, Daddy,” implored my sleepy son as I tried to remove him from the back seat. You don’t get a much more resounding endorsement than that. What makes this car stand out from the competition? I’ve yet to find a car that’s more comfortable than the Volvo V70. It sounds like a boring feature to dwell on, but it’s one that you’ll really appreciate, especially on long journeys. What would you tell your best friend about this car? There’s something about this car that gets under your skin. Give it a try, and you’ll see exactly what I mean. • Get your business on the road – call the Volvo Car Business Centre on 0345 600 4027 or visit volvocars.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:19:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
