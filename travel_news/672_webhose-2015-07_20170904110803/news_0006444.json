Tell us below.\nThe judge ordered the man to pay a $746 fine.\n“Your girlfriend slept long and deeply, which didn’t harm her, but this is certainly a premeditated bodily harm,” the judge said.\nThe ex-boyfriend admitted “it was stupid” but said he was now “on a straight path” after staying off drugs for 10 months, and was soon to start an apprenticeship.\nTwitter: @sopphie\nsophie.aubrey@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Guy drugs girlfriend to play video games", "external_links": ["http://www.thelocal.de/20150708/man-drugs-girlfriend-to-keep-playing-xbox", "http://www.twitter.com/sopphie", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/german-gaming-addict-fined-for-drugging-girlfriend-to-keep-playing-video-games-with-his-mate/story-fnq2oad4-1227434978460"], "published": "2015-07-09T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T06:22:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
