Source: Getty Images\nMITCHELL Starc has bowled Ben Stokes as he leads a late Australian fightback on day one.\nStokes had blasted six fours and two sixes in his innings of 52 but completely missed a swinging delivery which hit middle and off.\nEngland is 6/295 and has two new batsmen at the crease — Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler.\n2.30am — STARC GETS ROOT\nStarc flexed his muscles late on day one. Source: Getty Images\nJOE Root’s sensational ton finally came to an end after a timely bowling change by Michael Clarke late on day one.\nMitchell Starc replaced Shane Watson in the Australian attack and found an edge from Root — which was claimed by Watson at first slip.\nRoot’s final score was 134 (from 166 balls). He was the driving force behind England reaching 5/280 but if Australia can strike again (the new ball is just eight overs away) they can really work back into the contest.\n2.20am — ROOT, STOKES PILE ON PAIN\nIt’s been Joe Root’s day. Source: Getty Images\nBEN Stokes and Joe Root are turning the first Test in England’s favour with a free-hitting partnership late on day one.\nStokes (34 not out) and Root (133 not out) have added 75 runs at 4.5 runs an over since the dismissal of Gary Ballance. England is 4/271.\nScroll down for blow-by-blow coverage.\n1.20am — HAZLEWOOD STRIKES, ROOT POSTS TON\nJosh Hazlewood has picked up his second wicket. Source: Getty Images\nJOSH Hazlewood has undoubtedly been the pick of the Australian bowlers today and was rewarded with his second wicket just after the tea break.\nHazlewood snuck a full-pitched delivery past Gary Ballance and had him trapped LBW for 61.\nIt was the perfect start to the final session for the visitors, finally snapping a fourth wicket partnership which had climbed to 153 runs.\nJoe Root reached triple figures shortly afterwards as England moved to 4/203.\nRoot’s century came off just 118 balls making it the fastest in the first innings of the first Test of an Ashes series. It was also the first on day one of an Ashes Test in England since Mark Taylor in 1993.\n11pm — ENGLAND PASS THREE FIGURES\nGary Ballance continues to fight. Source: Getty Images\nTHE partnership between Joe Root (41) and Gary Ballance (38) has reached 64 runs as England begins to get on top of Australia at 3/107.\nAlastair Cook’s decision to bat has been vindicated by the look of the pitch.\n10pm — ROOT DIGS IN FOR ENGLAND\nJoe Root has returned fire with fire. Source: Getty Images\nENGLAND recovered to be 3/88 at lunch on the back of some fine strokeplay from Joe Root.\nRoot made Australia — in particular Brad Haddin — pay for an early dropped chance, racing to 33 not out from just 24 deliveries.\n“He’s certainly a better player than he was two years ago and he’s going to ask some questions of the Australian bowlers,” Mark Taylor said.\nGary Ballance began to open his shoulders towards the end of the session after a steady start and is 28 not out (57 balls).\nAustralia can be happy with the three wickets it claimed during the session but the bowling hasn’t been perfect. Mitchell Johnson is 0/35 from six overs while Mitchell Starc also struggled with his control.\n9.20pm — STARC TRAPS BELL\nMitchell Starc has been erratic but he also has a wicket. Source: AFP\nENGLAND is in trouble at 3/43 after Mitchell Starc trapped Ian Bell LBW for one.\nThe English No 4 missed a full-pitched inswinger which replays suggested was clipping his leg stump.\nStarc finally hit his straps after misfiring at times during the morning and should have had Joe Root’s wicket later in the over.\nRoot jammed his bat down on a full delivery and the ball clipped its edge and carried through to Brad Haddin. Haddin went with one hand when it appeared he should have gone with two and grassed the attempt.\n9.15pm — LYON REMOVES COOK\nAlastair Cook couldn’t convert a solid start. Source: AFP\nAFTER surviving an onslaught from the Aussie pace attack Alastair Cook has come unstuck to the spin bowling of Nathan Lyon.\nLyon had Cook caught behind by Brad Haddin with the second ball of his second spell, drawing a top edge with heavy overspin. England is 2/42.\n9pm — JOHNSON HAS POMS HOPPING\nGary Ballance had no idea about this one. Source: Getty Images\nALASTAIR Cook and Gary Ballance have done well to survive a testing opening spell by Aussie quick Mitchell Johnson.\nJohnson was introduced in the fifth over and immediately went about his business, landing a blow on Ballance with a short delivery which took the batsmen’s glove before cannoning into his chest.\nCook (20) and Ballance (eight) are still at the crease as England (1/34) steadies after the early departure of Adam Lyth.\n8.20pm — HAZLEWOOD STRIKES IN SECOND OVER\nJosh Hazlewood made a dream start to his first Ashes Test. Source: Getty Images\nWELCOME to Ashes cricket Josh Hazlewood.\nThe young Aussie quick has taken a wicket in his first over of Test cricket against England, removing opener Adam Lyth for six.\nHazlewood had been erratic with his first five balls but found his line and length with the sixth to draw a thick outside edge which was accepted by David Warner in the gully. England is 1/7.\nAustralia opted to hold back Mitchell Johnson early on day one, handing the new ball to Mitchell Starc and partnering him with Hazlewood.\n7.50pm — ENGLAND WINS TOSS, BAT FIRST\nMitchell Johnson warms up for the day’s play. Source: AP\nMITCHELL Johnson will have the chance to reacquaint himself with the England batsmen he tormented last summer — once light rain clears in Cardiff — after Alastair Cook won the toss and elected to bat in the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.\nAustralia have stuck with experience as expected, and have gone with the traditional model of three quicks and a spinner, with Nathan Lyon surviving pre-game speculation that the visitors may go with an all-out pace attack.\nThe stars of the West Indies tour Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have been given the nod to partner Johnson in the pace department, with Peter Siddle missing the cut.\nAll-rounder Shane Watson retains his place at No.6 ahead of Mitchell Marsh and Chris Rogers has reclaimed his opening spot at the expense of Shaun Marsh.\nEngland have gone with an unchanged line-up from the side that drew 1-1 with New Zealand.\nCook had no hesitation to bat first, perhaps eager to make an early statement.\nAustralian captain Michael Clarke admits he would have batted first as well had he won the toss, but he’s hoping the sun stays away in Cardiff and his bowlers can make the most of overcast, swinging conditions.\nAnd now a delayed start due to rain ... ah England, or in this case, Wales #Ashes2015\n— Glenn Mitchell (@MitchellGlenn) July 8, 2015 Australia haven’t won in England for 14 years and Clarke says it’s the final frontier.\n“No doubt. We certainly understand it’s been extremely tough for us to have success over here,” said Clarke. “This is the challenge we look forward to as players.\n“We have experience in our team – a lot of guys have played in these conditions. The highs and lows this team has gone through holds us in good stead. We know we’re playing against a very good team in our own backyard.”\n— News Corp’s Ben Horne\nTeams\nAustralia: David Warner, Chris Rogers, Steve Smith, Michael Clarke (c), Adam Voges, Shane Watson, Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon.\nEngland: Alastair Cook (c), Adam Lyth, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Butler, Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Mark Wood, James Anderson.\nLive: England v Australia (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1364742&ThemeId=16707 .)\nOriginally published as Starc leading Aussie comeback", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ashes2015?src=hash", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/196526-25a38c40-255e-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227434/462883-365b386c-2586-11e5-8e62-599d05d26d65.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/the-ashes-first-test-day-one-in-cardiff/story-fnu2penb-1227434118941", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/290005-50b25e4c-2569-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227434/469159-221f0eba-258f-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/265664-b5c11f7e-2566-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/217162-a86a58ec-255f-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1364742&ThemeId=16707", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/127865-acaf6550-2555-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227434/451062-d7ae1886-2583-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "https://twitter.com/MitchellGlenn/status/618718887522119681", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/09/1227434/472028-aaefc070-2591-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/341463-f33d56fa-2571-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/08/1227434/230408-7e963fa6-2562-11e5-b9c8-881f1ce24d70.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-09T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:22:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
