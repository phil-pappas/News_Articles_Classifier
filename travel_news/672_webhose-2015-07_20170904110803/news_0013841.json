A lawyer dealing with cases claims there are now up to 100,000 such marriages mostly involving young Muslim men - which are not recognised under UK law and leave women without full legal rights. Last year a report by AURAT, a charity which supports victims of honour-based violence, revealed that two thirds of Sharia marriages in its study were polygamous. London-based solicitor Aina Khan specialises in cases of Sharia law and told the Times: \"Probably a quarter of all the couples I see involve polygamy issues. There has been a high rise in recent years because people can have a secret Nikah (Islamic 'marriage' ceremony) and no one will know about it.\" She estimated that there were “potentially 100,000 Muslims without legal recognition”. The marriages have left Muslim women without full legal rights upon divorce. In March, home secretary Theresa May ordered a review into Sharia Courts. Extremism in Britain: Now the crackdown is launched Why banning Sharia courts would harm British Muslim women A counter-terrorism report leaked to the Telegraph revealed that the Government is “concerned about the way Sharia councils are working in some parts of the country” with “troubling reports that in some areas women have suffered from the way these councils work, either through forced marriage or discriminatory divorce proceedings.” It expressed concern that the rise of sharia is creating a \"parallel legal system\" within Britain's Muslim community. Women have to obtain a divorce through a Sharia Court but the court has no power to decide access to children or finances. Their husbands need only say 'I divorce you' three times, whereas a wife must meet other conditions and pay a fee. The AURAT report revealed many Muslim women are unsure of their legal rights and some women were even left believing that 'marriage' ceremonies were valid simply because they had taken place in the UK. Stephen Evans, of the National Secular Society, previously said: \"Islamic 'marriages' and sharia courts are quasi-legal systems operating within Muslim communities, and, as the report shows, both discriminate against women, who sometimes have little knowledge of their legal rights and are unable to access support services and are therefore all-too-often becoming trapped in insular religious communities.\" The group expressed concern that the rise of sharia is creating a \"parallel legal system\" within Britain's Muslim community. Women have to obtain a divorce through a Sharia Court but the court has no power to decide access to children or finances. Their husbands need only say 'I divorce you' three times, whereas a wife must meet other conditions and pay a fee. In the AURAT report, Baroness Cox called for a \"systematic investigation\" into the situation and called for women to be afford legal rights. \"The situations described in this report are just the tip of the iceberg,\" she wrote. \"There are, literally, countless more women in similar predicaments. I hope that appropriate actions will result, including systematic investigation into the problems of all women in similar circumstances as well as implementation of legal provisions and policies to afford them the protection and the genuine access to the rights to which they are entitled as citizens of our country.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T04:22:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
