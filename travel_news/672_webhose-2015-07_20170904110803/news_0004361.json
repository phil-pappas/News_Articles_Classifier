Also a member of Leading Hotels of the World, Verdura has appointed Azalea to increase its visibility to key golf markets in the UK and Europe, and to further strengthen its image as a luxury, year-round golf destination. \nSet in 230 hectares of stunning landscape overlooking the Mediterranean, with 1.8km of private coastline, the award-winning venue features 203 rooms and suites and is a paradise for golfers, with outstanding facilities including two 18-hole championship courses and a nine-hole par-three course, all designed by world-renowned golf architect Kyle Phillips. Marcello Della Vecchia, Director of Golf Sales at Verdura Resort, said: “Azalea has a proven track record of raising awareness and creating a ‘buzz’ with a range of fresh and innovative ideas and we’re looking forward to working closely alongside them to promote the outstanding golf product we have at the resort.” Verdura’s East Course was the host venue for the 2012 Sicilian Open – won by Denmark’s Thorbjørn Olesen – while the West Course features one of the most memorable finishes anywhere in the world with the final four holes set alongside the Mediterranean. The resort boasts outstanding practice facilities including a double-ended driving range and excellent golf academy, while other sports and leisure amenities include six tennis courts, a 60m two-tiered infinity pool, a 170sqm fully-equipped gym and an award-winning 4,000sqm spa complex. In addition, guests can sample an authentic taste of traditional Sicily with an array of locally-sourced dishes at one of Verdura’s four first-class restaurants. Luke Frary, account director at the Azalea Group, said: “Sicily is one of Europe’s fastest-growing destinations for golfers and we’re delighted to be working with such a prestigious resort as Verdura. “I have no doubt that the resort’s pioneering vision and exemplary guest experiences will establish it at the forefront of Europe’s modern golfing venues, and we look forward to promoting it to a wider audience across the continent.” In its ninth year of trading, Azalea has established itself as one of Europe’s leading specialist agencies, working with some of the continent’s major national and regional tourist boards, flagship golf and lifestyle resorts, and leading brands.
