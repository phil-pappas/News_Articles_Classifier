Many have the infamous Route 66 on their lists, yet the Utah Office of Tourism claims the iconic drive through Monument Valley, one of the most photographed places in the world, should be top of the list.

Whenever visitors come they are always treated as honoured guests. They are offered shelter, warmth and nourishment so they can continue on with their journey. The same hospitality we offer to you, and we hope that you have a safe and pleasant visit to our land.”\nThe iconic symbols of Monument Valley can be explored by a scenic driving route that leads to overlook of the park’s famous formations.\nGlobus has fully escorted all inclusive tour Enchanting Canyonlands from their newly launched 2016 program that take in Monument Valley from $3809pp including Monument Valley, Bryce and Zion National Parks.
