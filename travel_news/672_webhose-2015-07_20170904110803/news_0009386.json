LaGuardia Airport Redesign \nNew York State Governor Andrew Cuomo was joined by Vice President Joe Biden, who once likened LaGuardia Airport as something akin to a third-world country, to unveil the plan for the redesign of New York City’s LaGuardia Airport. \nThe airport will be combined from its several terminals into a unified main terminal with increased public transportation access, increased taxiway space, and new passenger amenities. The first half of the project is expected to cost around $4 billion, and it should break ground next year. You can read more about this project on the official page from the Governor’s website HERE -> LaGuardia Renderings, taken from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s Flickr page.

Adapted and taken by Flickr user pheezy. \nThe TWA Flight Center, designed by Eero Saarinen, was opened in 1962 as the original terminal for the famous TWA, or Trans World Airlines, at New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. For the past 14 years, the terminal has sat vacant, as no one wanted to destroy the historical landmark, yet no one knew what to do with it. \nNow, MCR Development has earned the right to convert the artistic masterpiece into The TWA Flight Center Hotel , a hotel with 505 rooms, 40,000 sq. ft. of meeting space, up to eight restaurants, and even an observation deck. \nBelow is the new rendering.

Official Consider New Trans-Hudson Tunnels for Trains \nFinally, the last bit of NYC transportation-related news involves the problematic train tunnels which run under the Hudson River from New Jersey into Manhattan in New York City. \nProblems such as leaks and delays plague this short stretch of rail, one of the busiest in the world. One major reason why these issues are hard to address is that both states have a say in any proposals, meaning that sometimes politics trump solutions. However, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has called on the governors of both states to come to the table once again to help come up with a solution to what’s known as the Gateway Project. \nRead more about this story at the NYTimes HERE -> TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:58:09.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
