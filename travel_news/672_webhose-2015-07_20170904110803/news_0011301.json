Her friends were saying, ‘You all right?’ and trying to give her water,” a witness said.\n“Her eyes were rolling and her chin was moving from side to side, chewing constantly.” Singer Lily Allen poses for a selfie with fans backstage at the Wireless Festival.

It looked like they were trying to get people away from her. She looked in a bad way, she was pretty f****d,” an onlooker said.\n“Before that I saw her staggering around looking haggard and out of it.”\nCausing trouble (Frame content direct link: https://instagram.com/p/4kflLIwMZS/embed .)\nAllen was not taken to hospital.

So it feels kind of unjust.\n“I think as long as you’re not being malicious and you’re not hurting people then you should not be ashamed of what you do. I’ve taken drugs. I found them and find them fun and I don’t think I’m a bad person because of it.”\nWedding ... British singer Lily Allen and Sam Cooper at their wedding ceremony in 2011.
