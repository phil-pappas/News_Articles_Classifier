The Oct. 3-11 program allows tour operators to explore an array of family-focused experiences and destinations in the two provinces, ranging from world-class cities and scenic railways to mountain adventures and the Canadian Rockies. \n\n\nAccompanying the PDT will be family travel expert Nancy Schretter, founder of Family Travel Network, an award-winning online magazine and website. With stops in Vancouver and Whistler, British Columbia; Jasper National Park and Edmonton, Alberta, the trip offers cool destinations in a hot market, according to NTA President Pam Inman. \n\n\n“Western Canada is loaded with family-travel opportunities, and Nancy is an exceptional resource in what’s become a lucrative travel segment,” Inman said. “This PDT unites tour operators with distinctive destinations and ties it all together with energy and expertise. It’s what NTA is all about.” \n\n\nAnd the PDT is all about variety. “Alberta’s diverse experiences allow tour operators to package inspiring, entertaining programs for families,” said Bart Donnelly of Travel Alberta. “From traveling by tram for stunning views of the Canadian Rockies to taking a float tour and spotting wildlife in one of our national parks, there’s something spectacular for the whole family. And our gateway cities provide easy access from across North America and offer an urban adventure with nature on the doorstep.” \n\n\nBritish Columbia also offers a wealth of diverse experiences. “Vacations should be fun, and we take fun seriously in British Columbia, whether you want to hike a mountain, take a wine country tour, tackle the rapid waters or simply enjoy a relaxing sunset on the beach,” said Sandy Reid of Destination British Columbia. “Because we’re nestled between the Pacific Ocean and Canada’s Rocky Mountains, British Columbia is a year-round playground where families will find activities for all ages.” \n\n\nFor the itinerary and application, visit the PDT web page on NTAonline.com. The Family Travel PDT to Alberta and British Columbia is the latest in a series of trips organized by NTA to help its North American-based tour operator members match upward-trending markets with desirable destinations. In recent years NTA has led trips to Ethiopia, Germany/Czech Republic, Morocco and the Holy Land (Jordan and Israel).
