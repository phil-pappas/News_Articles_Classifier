Fojas\nJuly 19, 2015 This time, the hotels will get the spotlight. After all, they made our stay in the places we travel, in or out of the country, extra special and comfortable. The Hotel Sales and Marketing Association (HSMA) believes that the time is ripe for the Virtus Awards, a multicategory initiative that is envisaged to transform the mindset of sales and marketing professionals in the hotels and resort industry, and set the tone for excellence. It brings into focus the key role sales and marketing professionals play in the country’s travel and tourism industry as they drive the bottom line value of their hotel properties and maximize the return on investment. The awards, organized by the Hotel Sales and Marketing Association (HSMA), in partnership with the Tourism Promotions Board of the Philippines, honor excellence in three individual sales and marketing categories—Associate, Manager, Leader—covering positions in room sales, events management, catering, reservation, public relations and communication, and revenue management.\n“More and more hotels have just opened and even more are in the pipeline. The building boom is nationwide in the response to the demand created by lifestyle changes globally, including those of the Filipinos,” says Rose Libongco, overall chair for the Virtus Awards. “We have long been fixated to international arrivals with a forecast of 10 million in 2016. But it is also true that we have more hotels and less sales and marketing experts. The Virtus Awards will shine the spotlight back on hotels and marketing in hotels and resorts and highlight the challenges and rewards inherit in the job. It is about looking for the best among the best in the industry.”\nEligible entrees are members of HSMA who have demonstrated outstanding performance in sales and marketing during the period of Jan. 1 until Dec. 31 2014. Entries are accepted in the following categories: Outstanding Sales and Marketing Associate, Outstanding Sales and Marketing Manager, Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leader, and Outstanding Marketing Campaign of the Year. For the Marketing Campaign category, the entry must include a Statement of Communication that will encapsulate a brief background of the campaign, marketing objectives, target market, planning and implementation, results, and budget/return on investment. The Marketing Campaign of the Year award shall recognize a campaign built around a single, unified theme, using at least two different types of media.\nThe Vitrus Awards is now open for nomination of entries. Deadline of entries is on Sept. 15. Judging of entries will be on Oct. 15 to 16. Winners will be announced in a Gala Dinner on Nov. 27.
