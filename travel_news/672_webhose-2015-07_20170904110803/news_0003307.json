Let’s camp on the beach! A fantastic way to beat the heat and have a wonderful time is to camp along our beautiful Pacific Coast. Bolsa Chica State Beach offers an opportunity for campers to enjoy our amazing beaches and ocean. Bolsa Chica State Beach is located in Huntington Beach, and extends three miles from Sunset Beach to Seapoint Avenue along Pacific Coast Highway. Bolsa Chica State Beach Campground is actually an extension of the beach parking area, right on the beach. The State Beach has 50 campsites with electric and water hookups. Also, no tents are allowed. The maximum length of your trailer or motorhome must not exceed 40 feet. This is a California State operated facility, and reservations can be made on the California Department of Parks and Recreation website. Bolsa Chica is a popular state beach. This stretch of beach was once called ‘Tin Can Beach.’ Average summer temperatures range in the high 70’s, while winter temperatures stay around the mid 60’s. The ocean in this area provides prime waves for surfing or wave riding. The surf breaks in shallow water, making for primo curled wave shapes as they crest. Fishing is also great sport in this area. Perch and Corbina can be caught from the beach, or designated fishing areas from the piers. With full and new moons during the summer months, try some bare handed fishing for California Grunion. A fishing permit is required and grunion can only be caught by hand. There are many activities within walking distance of the beach. Visit one of the Farmers Markets. The Surf City Nights Farmers Market is on Tuesday nights. This block long event has many food items, crafts, and gourmet delectable goods make by local folks. On Friday afternoons The Orange County Farm Bureau Farmers Market has baked goods, organic meats, and specialty foods. On Saturday mornings, The Village at Old World Farmers Market has organic and health related products, local arts, and craft vendors. Visit the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy. This community based organization protects 25 acres of salt marsh habitat. Take the historical Huntington Beach Walking Tour. Start with the Huntington Beach Pier. The original pier was a rough pine constructed pier in 1904. The current pier is the longest municipal pier in The United States. In 1939, The Pavilion Ballroom once stood where Duke’s Restaurant stands today by the pier. Triangle Park was once a baseball diamond surrounded by signboards in 1912. You can still see the outline and almost hear the sounds of a century old baseball game in progress. A short drive away is The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Worth the visit, this is one of the largest aquariums in The United States. The aquarium is home to over 11,000 ocean creatures. This is a unique experience. Visit their outdoor shark lagoon, the touch tank, and a very relaxing and beautiful lorikeet forest. There are many local restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance of Bolsa Chica State Beach. They are also very affordable. Experience a California beach that has a rich history. Have a mellow time, and Let’s Get Rollin’!
