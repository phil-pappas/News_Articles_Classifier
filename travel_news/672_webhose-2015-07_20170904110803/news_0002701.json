Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people Royal Jordanian adds Tabuk to network Adv: \nJul 07, 2015 Adv: \nFlag carrier, Royal Jordanian Airlines will commence regular flights between Amman and Tabuk in northern Saudi Arabia from July 15, 2015. \nThe airline will operate its one-hour service between the two cities twice-weekly on Wednesdays and Saturdays, though this may increase in light of the demand for a larger capacity on this route. Outbound services will depart from Queen Alia International Airport, Amman at 18:30pm, arriving into Tabuk at 19:30. The return journey will take off from Tabuk at 20:15pm, landing back into Amman at 21:15pm. \nFlights between Jordan and Saudi Arabia will increase to 60 weekly after the new route commences with a 12 weekly service to Riyadh, 28 weekly services to Jeddah, 10 weekly to Dammam, and seven-times-weekly service to Medina already in operation by the airline. \nRoyal Jordanian President and CEO, Captain Haitham Misto said that launching the new route in Saudi Arabia, which is a significant market for RJ, is part of the new strategy of the airline, which focuses at this phase on boosting services and operations in the Middle East and the Arab Gulf; this includes reaching new destinations and/or increasing frequency to current destinations. \nOperations to Tabuk are in response to the growing air transportation between the two kingdoms, which serves Jordanians, Arabs and international citizens working in Tabuk. \nSaudiâ€™s living in the north of Saudi Arabia will also be able to visit Amman and travel beyond the Royal Jordanian route network or carriers in the oneworld alliance. \nCaptain Misto added that travel between Tabuk and Amman is a smooth and comfortable way for a large number of citizens of the northern part of Saudi Arabia to reach Jordan seeking medical treatment. Jordan is known for its medical tourism at regional and international levels. \nOur analysis of OAG Schedules Analyser data shows the increase in two-way traffic between Saudi Arabia and Jordan since 2005. The available seat capacity between the two countries has increase by 324.2 percent over the ten year period, with Royal Jordanian, Saudia and Flynas operating the majority of flights between Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
