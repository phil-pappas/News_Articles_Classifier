Gelesis received positive confirmation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that GLOW is a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study, allowing the Company to expand the study to multiple U.S. sites. \"Expanding the GLOW study to a pivotal trial in the U.S. accelerates the development timeline for Gelesis100 and brings us one step closer to potentially launching a novel weight-loss therapy for overweight and obese patients,\" said Hassan Heshmati, Chief Medical Officer of Gelesis. \"We expect to begin enrolling patients in U.S. sites in the first quarter of 2016 and anticipate filing for FDA approval in the first half of 2017.\" The FDA's NSR designation allows Gelesis to proceed with the study in the U.S. without submitting and obtaining approval of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application because Gelesis100 does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. NSR devices are those that are generally considered to be low risk based on their intended use in the study. Examples of NSR devices include daily wear contact lenses, dental filling materials, and jaundice monitors for infants. The GLOW study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to assess the effect of repeated administration of Gelesis100 over six months on body weight and glycemic control parameters in overweight and obese subjects, including those with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The primary endpoints for the study are placebo-adjusted change in total body weight from baseline to end of treatment, and percent of patients with at least five percent weight loss. The secondary endpoints include changes in key glycemic control parameters. The GLOW study was initiated in November 2014 and is currently being conducted in nine sites across four European countries. The expansion of the study will result in a study population of at least 336 patients (currently 168 patients) across the U.S. and Europe. Contingent upon successful completion of the GLOW study, this expansion should allow the Company to announce topline data and file for FDA approval in the first half of 2017, as opposed to the previously planned submission in the first half of 2018. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T09:16:41.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
