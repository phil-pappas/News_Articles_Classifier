The concept is simple: In 2013 Kjartansson asked the band to play its song “Sorrow” at\nMoMA P.S.1 for six hours straight, without any breaks, for a total of 105 repetitions of the song. A video of the performance is currently on exhibit in Berlin in connection with the release of a limited-edition box set of nine transparent LPs. I went to the opening of the show last week at gallerist Johann König’s privately owned Brutalist church. Although I didn’t last the full six hours and only saw the band repeat the song 20-odd times, I have to say that there is something quite beautiful about sitting inside a cavernous, half-empty church while watching five guys perform a song about depression over and over again.\nA Lot of Sorrow is on view at König Galerie, St. Agnes, Berlin, through August 23.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Sven Schumann", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-08T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:39:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
