It is a religious experience, stretching from Peru's aptly named Sacred Valley, not too far from the city of Cusco, all the way to Machu Picchu. Really, it's only around 30 miles and can be traversed in a couple of days, but what it lacks in distance it makes up for in ecosystems, vistas, and ruins that are in no way ruinous.\nThe trek begins at a small parking lot near a gatehouse that serves as the origin for most hikes to Machu Picchu; travelers must show their entrance tickets and have their passports stamped before beginning the hike. From there, a trail follows the Rio Vilcanota for quite a while before heading up into the mountains. On the second day of the hike, we scaled to Dead Woman's Pass; around 14,000 feet above sea level, the pass is accessed by a steep climb where hikers are forced to break every few steps because of the thin air. It was a challenging ascent, but I was buoyed by the flow of others in similar struggle, and by the promise of incomparable vistas upon arrival.\nGetting there, a kind porter handed me a cup of mate de coca - a stimulant tea made from the leaves of the coca plant and said to help with altitude sickness; this is dubious - that I took gladly. I sat, laughed, and looked out over what may well be one of the perfect scenes our planet has produced.\nThe vistas were spectacular. The Andes, replicated crests as far as I could see, faded a shade the farther away they got. Some were all rock, some were lavish with greenery, some were snowcapped. All were indicative of the mighty wonder that is plate tectonics, when fingertips of the Earth's crust steeple together to pitch the land where it seems we can't go. But being human, of course, we are drawn to them. Mountains. We're drawn to them and we go.\nThe trail was everything and nothing I expected.\nOn the last day, after our 3 o'clock start, after the mate de coca, after a short final hike, we arrived at the first vantage of Machu Picchu to watch the sun gently rise and illuminate our path there.\nThe truth is, Machu Picchu is an amazing place, but I think there is too much focus on the structures of the city. For the Incas, the structures were just where people lived. The real treat was not looking in, but looking out. In doing that, we got a sense as to why the Incas built their magnificent city there.\nI'm certain that if one of the original architects could be there today, he/she'd tell us to stop looking at the structures and start looking out at all the wonder around the walls: the valley, the mountains, the river.\nMachu Picchu is just a symbol. It is an excuse. Beautiful in the extreme for sure, but really just a terminus.\nWe've been warned often enough to know that favoring destinations over routes is a foolhardy endeavor. The trail, all of it, was, well, what was sacred.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:59:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
