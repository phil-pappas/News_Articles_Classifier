I fear it will lead to increased numbers of forged papers from those areas. \nOn July 15th, the website quoted Klimkin at a meeting of Ukraines parliamentary committee on European integration, saying, Some countries pretend that everything remains as it was before, but against the background of internal pressure [to block more Ukrainians from visiting] they change the visa practice. That report quoted Klimkin saying he is now putting pressure on these consulates and capitals, demanding they return to the previous practice. \nThe report on July 21st discussed what might be causing these increased refusals: Why are Ukrainians denied visas? On this, we asked our expert Visa-free diary editor, ... Sergei Sidenko: \nThe problem of increasing the number of refusals last year was a response to the events in the East [especially the region that had voted 90%+ for Yanukovychand rejected the coup-imposed government, and where the new Ukrainian government responded by bombing that region]. Some countries are suspicious of Ukrainians generally, but especially of people who live near the conflict-zone, suspicious that theyll take advantage of tourist visas and ask for asylum. \nThe EU hadn't been very eager for Ukraine to be part of it, but Ukraines joining the EU had long been a goal of American Presidents in order to isolate and weaken Russia. \nEspecially President Obama planned for this, and made the changes in his Administration right after the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, in order to carry it out, such as by promoting Victoria Nuland to run European affairs, and transferring Geoffrey Pyatt to the Kiev Embassy to become the man on the ground coordinating it. \nThe fractious EU has gone along with Obamas plan, and (except for Netherlands), wasn't involved with planning and perpetrating the coup. \nThis is the reason why there still is considerable ambivalence within Europe as to whether or not Ukraine should ever be admitted into the EU: the U.S. is more eager for that to happen than the EU itself is. \nThe EUs leaders were even shocked to find out that Yanukovych had been overthrown by a coup. Only after the fact did it become the most blatant coup in history, because of the many leaks Global research alleged it was entirely a U.S.-run operation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:24:56.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
