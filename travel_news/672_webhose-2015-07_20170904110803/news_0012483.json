This is thanks to being set in private concession on the tip Chief's Island in the Moremi Game Reserve. The area is flooded with nutrient rich water during the Okavango Delta's annual floods, supporting lush grasses that attract grazers and the carnivores that hunt them. Mombo is also known for attracting some of the best guides in Botswana.

There are only 11 individually handcrafted guest villas on the entire island. The villas are enormous yet constructed in harmony with the natural surroundings and have an understated elegance. All the villas are built directly on the eastern beach. Because it the island is small, clients can always reach a sheltered beach where swimming conditions are prime, regardless of monsoon winds that can affect other properties in this region. This is truly an escape from the cares and pressures of the modern world.

When Ngorongoro Crater Lodge was built, the lodge set a new standard for elegance, style and service that is yet to be matched in the area. Inspired in design by the Maasai mud and stick manyatta (homestead), this is without doubt one of the most architecturally spectacular safari lodges in Africa. The crowds in the Crater region can be daunting, but this is the ultimate haven to flee home to after a day of game watching in this amazing caldera.

The focus at Abu Camp is interacting with the camp’s herd of 7 habituated elephants. These interactions include everything from elephant back-safaris, to walking with the elephants, to watching mud bathing, training and veterinary care, to learning about local elephant research and conservation efforts. The camp itself consists of six beautiful tens raised on teak decking and overlooking a lagoon. The staff and service are excellent. The opportunity to interact so intimately with elephants, combined with the level of luxury the camp offers, make it an experience you cannot have anywhere else.
