While Cyberdyne’s robots will carry out some menial tasks, some of HND’s human employees will be equipped with Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) machines. These powered suits — also developed by Cyberdene — will enable staff to assist passengers struggling with cumbersome loads.\nAt present, it has been agreed that Cyberdyne will supply HND with five cleaning robots, three luggage carrying robots and three HAL machines on a trial basis. Depending on the results of the trial, these numbers may be increased.\nThe robots will help airport employees with luggage at the airport. AFP PHOTO / Toru YAMANAKA Source: AFP\nJAT says these technologies were developed to meet the demographic challenges that face modern Japan — namely, those presented by a plummeting birthrate, an ageing population and a decrease in the working population.\nJAT is also working with Cyberdyne to develop robots that can be used for security and serve as users, which will help tourists navigate the airport.\nBloomberg reports JAT President Isao Takashiro, in a joint statement with Cyberdyne, said he not only wants to expand this technology across Japan, but also hopes that it may one day become commonplace in airports around the globe.\nWhile the technology soon to be rolled out at the airport seems novel, it is part of a much wider scheme. According to Japan Times, the use of robot porters, cleaners and the HAL suits at HND are all part of the Japanese government’s refreshed Japan Revitalization Strategy, which lists robot research and development as one of its main areas of focus.\nOriginally published as The big change coming to airports", "external_links": ["http://www.flyertalk.com/articles/team-of-robots-scheduled-to-begin-airport-invasion-this-september.html", "http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/tokyo-airport-to-introduce-robots-to-assist-with-cleaning-and-luggage/story-e6frfq80-1227441250935", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-02/say-konnichi-wa-to-robots-in-tokyo-airport-as-population-ages", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/14/1227441/250885-c7125e2c-29cc-11e5-8933-a184cf0f8d1e.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-14T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:48:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
