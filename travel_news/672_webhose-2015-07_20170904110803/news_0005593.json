Rudeness has negative effect on performance too. (Shutterstock) \nToo much rudeness at work could rub off on you as a new study claims that rudeness at workplace is contagious. \nPeople who face rude behaviour at work are more likely to grasp rudeness in future intercommunications, finds the study conducted by University of Florida's Warrington College of Business Administration. \nTrevor Foulk, a doctoral student says that when they experience rudeness, it makes rudeness more noticeable and they will experience more rudeness if it's not there. \nFoulk says that part of the problem is that they are generally tolerant of these behaviours, but they're actually really harmful. \nThe study, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, follows 90 graduate students practicing negotiation with classmates. Those who rate their initial negotiation partner as rude are more likely to be rated as rude by a subsequent partner, showing that they passed along the first partner's rudeness. Rudeness directed at others can also prime our brains to detect discourtesy. \nJust like those who experience rudeness firsthand, people who witness it are more likely to be rude to others. It means rudeness will flavor the way you interpret ambiguous cues. Rudeness also has a negative effect on performance.
