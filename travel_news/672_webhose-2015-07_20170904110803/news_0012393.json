The voyage will take passengers to the Falklands, home to a profusion of seabirds and migratory birds, and then the remote island of South Georgia where thousands of king penguins cake the shores. The itinerary includes a visit to old whaling stations and the grave of history’s most famous Antarctic explorer, Sir Ernest Shackleton. \n\n\nThe voyage continues south through the rugged South Shetland and South Orkney islands before reaching the coast of Antarctica where four days are spent exploring the great white continent and visiting scientific research stations and historic huts during daily excursions by the ship’s zodiacs. The opportunity to spend a night camped on the ice may also be possible, weather permitting. \n\n\nIncluding onboard lectures, meals and zodiac excursions, the 20-night package is available from US$14,495 per person, twin-share. Bookings will include two free nights’ accommodation with breakfast in Ushuaia prior to the cruise and a flight credit of A$750 per person flight credit to be used towards international flights to Ushuaia booked in conjunction with the cruise through Active Travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:41:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
