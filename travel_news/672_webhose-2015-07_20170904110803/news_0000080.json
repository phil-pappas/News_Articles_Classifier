The strengthening US economy appears to be driving an influx of business travelers to many key US cities, with seven out of the top ten international locations beyond Asia Pacific being located in the US. \nEncompassing all air bookings made directly with GBT for Australian-based travelers between March 2014 and April 2015, the travel destinations report provides a snapshot of business travel flows within, and from, Australia. Sydney, Singapore and London emerge as the top destinations for domestic, APAC, and international business travel outside APAC, respectively. Singapore, Auckland and Hong Kong emerge as the top three international destinations, highlighting the dominance of regional centres for Australian business. \n“Singapore remains the leading business hub of Asia-Pacific, and with many large corporations having headquarters there, and we anticipate that it will remain a top international destination for Australian business travelers for some time to come,” said David Reimer, General Manager, American Express Global Business Travel, APAC. \n“The biggest change over the last twelve months is the growing dominance of the US as a priority market for business travel beyond APAC. While US cities comprised less than half of the top ten in 2013-2014, we’ve now seen that number increase to seven out of the top ten this year. This indicates the growing importance of the US to Australian businesses.” \nAsia remains the focus \nWhen looking at the rankings for total international business travel from Australia, countries within Asia remain the primary focus. London is the highest ranked destination outside of Asia, followed by New York. The top five rankings remain unchanged from the previous year, however The Philippines is a new listing to this year’s top ten rankings, coming in at ninth. \nTop 10 total international destinations including APAC \nRank Destination", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:20:57.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
