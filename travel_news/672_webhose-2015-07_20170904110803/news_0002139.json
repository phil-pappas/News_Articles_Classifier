You heard the government's appeal for you to join in and claim back our tourism industry. Now it is important that we all rally to defend our industry that remains vital for the Seychelles economy,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nMinister St.Ange; Anne Lafortune, Principal Secretary for Tourism; and Sherin Naiken, Chief Executive of the Seychelles Tourism Board, were on the west side of Mahe last Friday for what their ministry calls their door-to-door of licensed hotels in Seychelles. Since 2014, Minister St.Ange has been visiting small and large hotel establishments. Seychelles has a total of 481 properties. The visits started on Praslin island covering so far 117 out of 124 small and large properties. Early this year, Minister St.Ange started visiting small and large hotels on Mahe, and he has to date visited 14 out of 251 properties on Mahe. The target is to tour all properties on Mahe before the end of the year. He will also visit the 85 licensed properties on La Digue. Minister St.Ange and his delegation has also already visited hotels on outer islands such as Fregate Island Private and Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa. \nSpeaking about the hotel door-to-door visits, Minister St.Ange said that staying connected is a commitment made by the president. “For tourism, staying connected means getting out and about and seeing the tourism establishments, meeting the management and owners and discussing with as many staff members as possible. Managing tourism needs passion, for us at the Ministry and at the Tourism Board the most important thing is just sheer passion,\" said Minister Alain St.Ange as he reiterated that the door-to-door hotel visits is but one way to enhance the cooperation between the Ministry of Tourism and Culture and the islands’ private sector. \nDuring the visit at the different small hotels on Friday, Minister St.Ange was informed of the challenges faced by the small hotel owners as he was informed of the positive occupancy they were currently enjoying. The small hotel owners expressed their appreciation for being today able to be part and parcel of the island's tourism industry. \"We today work for ourselves and earn more than we were doing when we were employed in hotels,\" said a small hotel owner who appreciated that government was keeping licenses for small hotels with under 15 rooms reserved only for Seychellois. \"Today we feel part of the industry, and this is opening new opportunities for Seychellois,\" said another small hotel owner. \nThe moratorium on large hotel construction as announced by President James Michel on June 29 at the National Day Celebrations was also a point discussed and appreciated by the small hotel owners. \"We support this move by government, because the country needs time to further increase the visitor arrival numbers. Today, we have the non-stop direct flights to Paris, and this will help. But as a country, we need hotel occupancy level to increase before more large hotels are built,\" said a small hotel owner. On the question of occupancy of hotels, two of the hotel owners said that today they were following the global tourism trend, and as the new drive of marketing hotel establishments, here in Seychelles, last-minute canceling and clients not showing up after confirmation of bookings by online bookings agents are hindering smooth running of homegrown establishments. \nLicensed homegrown establishments such as self-caterings, studios, and apartments owned by Seychellois, depended heavily on online booking agents to market their establishments and to fill up their rooms. \nBut they also said that on two occasions, the Ministry of Tourism and Culture have filed reports of last-minute cancellations and clients not showing up after confirmations of agent’s online bookings. \nThe small hotel establishments on the northwestern coast of Mahe that were visited last Friday by Minister St.Ange were Armony Residence, Chrisent Residence, Lydie’s Self Catering, and Jamalac Apartments. \nThe owner of Lydie’s Self Catering at Beoliere, Lydie Mathurin, said that although their four-room apartment is today fully booked from August - December 2015, clients not showing up sometimes after confirmations of online bookings are hindering her business. “We have no idea where our clients go. Even if we go to the airport to collect them, they simply don’t show up,” said Lydie Mathurin. \nMinister St.Ange said that this was not acceptable and reassured the owner, the Ministry of Tourism and Culture will be looking into the matter and discussing this with the online booking businesses. The minister also encouraged the small homegrown properties to diversify their bookings pattern by marketing with more than one of these booking agents. \n“Today, we say we are happy with the hotel visits we did. It is very clear that we need to keep promoting community-based tourism such as is being provided by the small Seychellois-owned establishments. We shall continue to work with you and ensure you are well guided in the marketing your products,” Minister St.Ange said to the owners of these small hotels he visited. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
