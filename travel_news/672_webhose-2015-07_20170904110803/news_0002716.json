The ongoing trend towards premium spirits is powering growth, said Fever-Tree co-founder Tim Warrillow, as consumers trade up to a premium mixer to go with their craft gin or vodka. Sales in June were especially strong, the company said, as trade customers built up inventory ahead of the summer rush. Profits for the first-half should rise by around 60pc, and Fever-Tree is expected to announce that its full-year turnover will be “materially ahead of expectations” when it releases its interim results on July 27. “I’m confident that this will be a long-term trend,” Mr Warrillow said. “The premiumisation of spirits is a development rather than a trend. It’s the same thing we’ve seen with craft beer, crisps and chocolate.” Fever-Tree has benefited from strong growth across its 50 international markets , with no stand-out territories or underperfoming areas. “The truth is, [growth] really is happening across the board,” Mr Warrillow said. Investec analyst Nicola Mallard advised a “degree of caution” to investors, warning that the sales uplift from the stock-build could be short-lived, which would result in flatter growth in the second half of the financial year. “We expect a more evenly-weighted revenue year at £48m,” she said, setting a “buy” recommendation . Tim Warrillow (right) and co-founder Charles Rolls Fever-Tree is the market leader in the premium mixer industry and has seized significant market share from incumbent Schweppes. It is the best-selling tonic in 37pc of UK bars, according to the Drinks International Brand Report 2015. Fever-Tree was founded in 2005 by Charles Rolls and Mr Warrilow. The drinks group generates about 60pc of its sales from tonic-related products, with the balance coming from elderflower, ginger beer and ale, and soda water. Fever-Tree’s largest market, with about 40pc of sales, is Europe, with Spain being a key region. UK sales contribute about 30pc, the US about 23pc and the balance from the rest of the world. The company listed on Aim in November last year, raising a total of £93.3m, of which nearly all the funds, £89.3m, went to investors who were selling their interest in the company.
