Photo courtesy of Quicket As a regular traveler, I have more than 30 apps in two folders on my iPhone, and each of them does something useful. But Quicket Co-Founder Fred Finn, the Guinness world record holder for the most air miles flown by a passenger having traveled more than 15 million miles, feels that his app could be the solution to myriad apps offerings.\nFinn calls Quicket a multi-purpose mobile application that aims to be a “one-stop-app for all your travel needs.\nCurrently available for iOS, the app helps travelers with everything from booking a flight in under a minute to selecting a seat on the plane, without having to switch between applications.\n“I am tired of having 10 or more travel apps on my phone. Quicket will address this by providing end-to-end travel services, making this the last travel app I will ever need,” said Finn in a press release.\nFinn, who started his travels in 1958 and reached 15 million air miles by 2010, said he flew a great deal withPan Am during its heyday and found it to be a good long-haul carrier. “Other early favorites were British Airways because of Concorde, United Airlines for U.S. flights and American Airlines when I used to commute from Nashville to New York City,” he said. “I have also flown on Avianca, Iberia, Ethiopian many times into and around Africa, Kenya Airlines when I lived in Kenya, Air India, Aeroflot, ELAL, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, JAL, All Nippon, Thai Airlines, KLM, Braniff, Delta, Ukraine International and others.”\nBefore Quicket came along, Finn said he mostly used the TripAdvisor website, government advisories, hotel and airline websites rather than apps. “It was all very laborious until Quicket.”\nDjois Franklin Sronipah, CEO and co-founder of Quicket, showed Finn the prototype at a travel conference. “I was immediately interested, and Djois was able to incorporate my feedback based on my many years of travel,” he said. “This enabled us to create a seamless, end-to-end app tailored to the independent traveler.”\nSome of Quicket’s main features include:\nTicket purchase in under one minute, from more than 700 airlines\nSecure speedy payment system\nAdvanced filters including: airline alliance, layover and more\nFrequent flyer program recognition\nTicket cancellations and changes\nBaggage allowance notification\nMobile check-in\nOn-board seat advisor (tells you where the best and worst seats are)\nMeal selection feature\n24-hour English-language customer support\nFinn understands those of us with travel app fatigure, but says Quicket is worth a look. “ With Quicket, you can do everything from checking in to your flight to tracking its progress, without having to store a library of applications, and it works across all airlines,” he said.\n“Imagine that you have a journey with three flight legs, each with a different airline. Without Quicket, you would have to use three different airline apps to access flight information and check-in, a separate seat advisor app, a flight tracking app, etc,” Finn said. “With Quicket you can effectively replace all of these apps with one. And if that's not enough, more functionality is being added to upcoming releases.”\nThe Quicket team keeps close tabs on the travel industry, including regularly attending and speaking at conferences, said Finn. “We work closely with some of the leading technology providers in the industry,” he said.\nThe team aims for quarterly updates, which includes new features and also maps for the seat advisor section of the app. “Decisions about updates are made by the whole Quicket team, including myself. These updates are then implemented by Quicket’s technical staff,” said Finn. “Our revenue model is based on small commissions from the paid-for-services that we offer our users,” he said.
