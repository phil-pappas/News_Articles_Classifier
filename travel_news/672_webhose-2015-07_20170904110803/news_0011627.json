The founder, Brandon Chrostowski, who opened the restaurant in 2013, has about 40 formerly incarcerated, stipend-earning students training with him in all parts of the restaurant at any given time. His goal is for them to be ready to work in the industry within six months.\nBut the restaurant dumbs nothing down and unapologetically prices many of its locally sourced, classically French entrees in the $30 to $40 range. “We know we have to be two or three times as good as anyone else,” Mr. Chrostowski said. The unspoken question on many diners’ minds is this: Can this crew pull it all off? Is it wrong to even wonder?\nDuring a late winter dinner, the physical surroundings sometimes seemed dissonant. There was a television on, which was hard not to notice in a room that dark. Stevie Wonder was on the soundtrack as the escargots passed by; then the Commodores accompanied a warning from the waiter about the need to allow 25 minutes for the soufflés.\nThe menu offered pleasant and thoughtful surprises, though, starting with cocktail foundations like house-pressed cider and fig-infused bourbon. Vegan offerings in each course felt almost like a dare. One was an otherwise rather dull terrine of legumes, peppers, green peppercorns and mushrooms that needed the punch that pickled red onions provided. But a grilled tofu dish with “béarnaise sauce” that had scare Quote: s on the page (owing to its lack of butter and eggs) was plenty friendly on the plate. As was game. The tarte de lapin pairs rabbit with a Parmesan and prosciutto crust; it’s what a favorite family meatloaf might taste like if Grandma were a trapper.\nThose soufflés are a high-wire act. The first one out to our table was so sodden that the kitchen had started a new one before the fallen confection had reached us. The second was perfect, but vanilla, not the raspberry version that had not cut it the first time.\nIt seemed to prove the rule stated on the back of the menu: “At Edwins, we believe in second chances.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T15:42:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
