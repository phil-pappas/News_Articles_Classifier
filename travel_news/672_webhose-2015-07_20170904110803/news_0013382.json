His latest post: Having a \"zero day\" doing absolutely nothing in Bozeman, Montana, and actually considering it a trip highlight (so different from me...yet so intriguing). \nCameron Hewitt reports from Sarlat, in France's Dordogne Valley: It's market day and the world is a wonderland of tapenade, fruitcake, and wheels of cheese the size of tire trucks. \nNicolina has finished her Hearts of India art tour: Read about her finale in Delhi, how she turned a five-hour layover at the Istanbul airport into a life-long memory, and her homecoming in NYC. \nJackie Steves and her brother Andy report from Bali: They're luxuriating in a posh \"yoga\" hotel and climbing a volcano for the sunrise. From here, my kids head for Vietnam. \nEnjoy these as a traveler's amuse-bouche in my Travelers Café before I fly to Germany to begin part two of my 2015 travels. Coming up: 45 days of travel in Germany and England with daily posts from the road. Thanks for traveling with me! \nFollow Rick Steves on Twitter: www.twitter.com/RickSteves More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:20:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
