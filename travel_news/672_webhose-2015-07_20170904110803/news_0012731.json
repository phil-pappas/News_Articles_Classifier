But if the court eventually finds that they were tortured, the credibility of the government will be damaged,\" said Mr Nakhon. \nThe Lawyers' Council of Thailand received complaints about the alleged torture and sent a legal team to help. The Myanmar embassy has also requested the LCT's help in the case. \nAbout a dozen witnesses from both the prosecution and defence will testify to the court during the trial, which is expected to last three months.   4 people liked / 61  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:13:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
