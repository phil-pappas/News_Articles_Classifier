They build medium and boutique hotels. We definitely can’t take in the very tall and big ships. So we do a lot of marketing to to court boutique ships.” \n\n“Boutique (cruise) passengers are normally very well-off and they have lots of disposable income. We also have a service variation where we do more of a white glove service and we treat them with a higher level of care so that pleases them,” Siaw added \n\nAcknowledging that SCC’s HarbourFront Terminal is not able to accommodate mega cruise ships like the Quantum of the Seas, Siaw said the company is looking at internal and external capacity improvements. \n\nThe MBCCS and SCC are also closely working zwith the government to increase the number of cruise lines visiting Singapore. \n\nLee Yi Shyan, senior minister of state for the Ministry of Trade and Industry said: “We are keeping in touch with (cruise line) operators to understand their needs and how we can help them. Giving incentives is one thing but we are focusing on market development and how we can improve the entire experience – experience being logistics support and what (cruise passengers) can do on shore.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T19:14:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
