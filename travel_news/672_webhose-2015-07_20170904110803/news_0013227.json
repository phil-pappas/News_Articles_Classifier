Hotels - Airlines - CVBs - Destinations - people London’s red double-deckers going electric Adv: \nJul 02, 2015 Adv: \nLONDON, England – Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, announced at the C40: Clean Bus Summit held at London City Hall that the city’s iconic double-decker buses will be converting over to become electric vehicles. \nOne of the world's most recognized transportation systems, TFL (Transportation for London), is known for their red double-decker buses, and they have been contracted to manufacture a brand new battery electric replacement for the buses. The company selected to build the next generation London Bus double-deckers is global electric vehicle leader, BYD Company Ltd. \n\"Many believed that a pure electric double-decker bus would not be possible due to the size of the battery packs required to power it,\" said Mayor Johnson. \"However by working with BYD and utilizing the latest cutting-edge technology, London has been able to secure another world first. The new electric double-decker trial will see the zero emission double-decker buses manufactured by BYD enter service on Route 16 from October.\" \nAlso addressing the Clean Bus Summit was BYD's Managing Director of European Operations, Isbrand Ho. \n\"We are delighted to be chosen by London as its partner for the world debut of our new pure electric double-decker. As the Mayor has said, this is genuinely world beating new technology,\" said Ho. \"Since BYD is by far the world's largest maker of zero emission pure electric buses and as such is keen to promote their take up and use as quickly as possible we are also pleased to have today supported the Declaration and pledged BYD to helping promote zero – not just ultra low – emission vehicles on the streets of the world's major cities.\" \nBYD's Battery Electric bus employs many advanced technologies developed in-house by a staff of more than 15,000 R&D engineers including the BYD Iron-Phosphate Battery which boasts the only 12-year-battery warranty in the industry. Combined with BYD's proprietary in-wheel hub motors and regenerative braking system, the BYD battery electric bus offers the lowest life cycle cost of ownership. The BYD electric bus delivers a host of operational and environmental benefits for public transit riders, bus operators and residents of the community – it is very quiet and ensures a comfortable ride without vibrations, jerks or the noise associated with the conventional buses and combustion engines. The bus can also drive for more than 155 miles even in heavy city traffic on a single charge. As of April 1st, 2015, BYD bus fleets have completed greater than 50 million miles \"in revenue service\" and have been evaluated by more than 150 cities in 36 countries around the world. To date, BYD has built over 5,000 electric buses globally, making it by far the most popular electric transit vehicle on the planet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T03:19:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
