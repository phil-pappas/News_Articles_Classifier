Taking a regular walk is an easy and cost-effective way to enjoy all these health benefits. Walking can be enjoyed by people of all ages, all fitness levels and all budgets. For a gentle stroll you don’t need any specialist equipment, and it’s easy to fit this exercise around your busy schedules, whether it be shorter walks on a daily basis, or a longer tramp through the countryside at the weekend. Walking is a great communal activity. There aren’t many sports that grandparents and grandchildren can enjoy together, but going for a stroll is a great way for families to spend time together while keeping active. Now that the days are longer and the sun is shining, it is the perfect time to get off the sofa and out into the fresh air. You should soon start to see the positive effects that such activity has on your health. Keeping active and walking regularly helps people maintain their weight, lowers blood pressure, helps build healthy bones and muscles, and can improve “good” cholesterol. But the benefits aren’t just physical. Reports have shown that those who exercise regularly sleep better, have improved concentration and feel less stressed. In other words, this all leads to healthier, happier lives. If you could bottle the effects of a good walk in the country, it could be sold as a miracle drug Where you choose to walk can also boost this sense of well-being. Many people find that ambling somewhere in the countryside, where they are closer to nature, can have a restorative effect at the end of a hectic working week. You don’t have to live next to one of the UK’s national parks to feel this benefit, though. Those who live in more urban areas can get the same effect by walking through local parks, exploring canal towpaths or heading out into local woodland. To discover the footpaths, bridleways and open spaces near you, you’ll need a good map. Ordnance Survey now produces a range of paper and digital maps to help you get the most out of your walk. These digital mapping services are available online or via a smartphone app, and will enable you to explore your local area, plan routes and track how far you’ve walked. For those feeling more adventurous, these maps can also show routes that are suitable for those cycling, another great way to improve your fitness and explore the great outdoors. If you sign up to OS Maps’ subscription service, you can gain access to all of Ordnance Survey’s UK maps, enabling you to plan longer rambles and day trips to explore some of the stunning UK countryside and national parks. It has been said that if you could bottle the effects of a good walk in the country, it could be sold as a miracle drug or wonder cure. With the help of an OS map it’s easy to get your daily dose, and enjoy a variety of walks that are available, both close to home and further afield. • To find out more about the new-generation OS maps, visit os.uk/mobile", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:31:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
