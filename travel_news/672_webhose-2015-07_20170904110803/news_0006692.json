The official National Trail, the Thames Path, is designed for walkers with only some sections suitable for bikes.\nHowever, at about 200 miles (322km) from source to the Thames Barrier, it’s also a long walk that requires serious fitness. Walking also means a lot more nights out on the trail and accommodation doesn’t come cheap within walking distance of the Thames. Even if cycling wasn’t in a tour guide, I decided I had to give it a go. he first water of the Thames. Picture: Dot Whittington Source: Supplied\nThe goal was to enjoy the beauty of the English countryside and dance with Father Thames from the tinkling brooks at its source to the crescendo of the economic lifeblood surging through London. I wanted to know more about its story as it wends through half a dozen counties and some of England’s most evocative scenery – the Cotswolds, Oxford, brushing against the Chiltern Hills and through central London.\nAnd so it was, that I landed in London on a cool early autumn morning and went in search of a bicycle to tackle what would turn out to be a 365km ride.\nTwo panniers hanging off the rear rack dictated how much I could carry – a few items of clothing and a toothbrush, a book listing fun facts about the Thames, a map and River Thames handbook and then the heavy offenders, a secure bike lock and my laptop. Add a camera and I was ready to ride. The view from Halfpenny Bridge. Picture: Dot Whittington Source: Supplied\nThe journey starts at London’s Paddington station on a train bound for Kemble in Gloucestershire.\nIt’s a pleasant 90-minute trip out of the big smoke heading west through open country. After a quick change in Swindon, I was on my bike and heading out of Kemble in search of the Thames source.\nThe first tentative miles led to the Thames Head Inn, a good sign that I was on the right track. Finding the track to the official source stone was much trickier.\nExpecting a clearly marked path, I was disappointed, but after riding up and down a likely section of the A429, regularly stopping to pore over the map, I finally spotted a path on the opposite side of a gate at the bottom of four high stone steps.\nNow I could see why the route was not recommended for cyclists but I hadn’t come this far to give up or to leave my life’s possessions by the road. It was an inauspicious start as I wrestled the loaded bike down the steps and through the gate using techniques I would get many opportunities to develop.\nFinally, I was on my way across the meadow, amazed that I could be in such a small and populous country and not see another living soul.\nThe track was more cow track than footpath – or bikepath – but after passing through two sets of livestock gates and nudging against a herd of cows, I spotted a grove of trees, which looked like it might be the one I was seeking. The stone that signifies the source of the Thames. Picture: Dot Whittington Source: Supplied\nAfter bouncing across more paddock, I pulled up at a lump of granite announcing that this was indeed the official source of the river Thames. Nearby, under an old ash tree, a circle of rocks marked the head spring.\nApparently, sometimes there is water here, but not today. In fact, it’s some miles before I spot water, although there are a couple of old stone bridges indicating where it has been.\nI retrace my steps to the A429 and set off across more isolated meadows clearly not meant for a bike so there’s more pushing than pedalling, towards Ewen, the first night’s stop.\nIt’s a pretty little Cotswold village that’s home to the Wild Duck Inn, so-named because this is the first place after the source where ducks can be seen.\nIt’s still early so, aware that there are parts of the young Thames here that are simply impossible to cycle, I park the bike and strike out on foot.\nIt’s an easy two-mile stroll along narrow paths with plenty of kissing gates and stiles, and by the time I arrive in Somerford Keynes, I have seen the first puddles of the Thames, heard the first chuckle of running water and, finally, dipped my hand into a babbling brook. Kissing gates are a real challenge for bike riders. Picture: Dot Whittington Source: Supplied\nThe next morning, leaving Ewen while the early mists are still swirling across the road, I set off through the Cotswolds Water Park created mainly from old quarries and abandoned railway tracks, with forest trails weaving among them.\nGradually, the Thames grows from a stream into the scene I’d been waiting for, at Lechlade’s Halfpenny Bridge, looking down a stretch of river with swans and boats bobbing, willows weeping and a quaint pub at its side.\nLechlade is the highest point on the Thames that laden barges could reach so it’s here that the downhill run, dropping 110m to the estuary, really begins.\nNearby is St John’s Lock, the first, or last, of the 44 locks that permit boats and barges to travel the Thames.\nIt was here that I found old Father Thames himself. The statue was built for the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London in 1854 and was later acquired by the Thames Conservators and moved to the source which, as I had discovered, is remote. He was being damaged by vandals and few ever saw him, so he was moved and now happily reclines watching the lock with the St Lawrence church spire behind him. And so my dance with the Thames begins in earnest.\nI learn that if I leave the waterside for too long I am bound to get lost and I learn that if I allow the Thames to lead, I risk becoming unstuck by a path that is in places tricky for walkers and impossible for cyclists.\nIt’s this dilemma that led me to the mistakes that added 35km to my trip, which isn’t all bad over a 330km distance. The journey is packed with history, across the Oxford meadow that inspired Alice in Wonderland , through Windsor where the castle towers over every street and past Runnymede where the Magna Carta was signed.\nI cycled only about 35 miles a day so I could soak up the beauty of the Thames and enjoy the dance, to see the sights, study the books and enjoy the ride, rather than set a land speed record.\nQuaint nettle-protected bridges where a distant church spire is the only reassurance of civilisation, give way to massive stone bridges, busy towns and boats in all shapes and sizes.\nFinally, at Teddington Lock – the last/first lock – the sedate pace of the river changes as it’s here that the Thames becomes tidal, its placid waters now churning as the river rushes back and forth to London. Tidal flood barriers on the Thames. Picture: Dot Whittington Source: Supplied\nThe ride through the city is pure pleasure, scooting past crowds on the Embankment, and enjoying a cyclist’s eye view of the many attractions that draw the crowds to London.\nFinally, the Thames Path sign that has entered my psyche over the past eight days, announces the Thames Barrier is only five miles away. It’s a downhill run now from Greenwich on past the Millennium Dome and with the whiff of victory in the air, I pedal like my life depends upon it.\nMission accomplished.\nIt’s an adventure that is worth every aching joint and is heartily recommended.\nGO2\nTHAMES\nGETTING THERE\nRegular train services London Paddington to Kemble, Gloucestershire.
