Similar performances were registered in non-rooms departments and total revenue per available room (TRevPAR) rose by 9.5% to €230.59. Astute operating cost control and a payroll decline of 1.8 percentage points resulted in departmental operating profit per available room (DOPPAR) surging by 13.2% and GOPPAR by 15.0% to €107.28. \nHamburg hoteliers also forged ahead in June and recorded an 8.2% hike in RevPAR as a result of a 1.1 percentage point increase in occupancy combine with a 6.8% growth in ARR to €147.40. This ARR growth was most notably fuelled by a 34.5% increase in the tours/groups segment rate. Mixed performances were recorded in non-rooms revenues, which softened TRevPAR levels to a growth of 7.7% to €180.29. A flat performance in payroll costs ultimately helped to deliver a GOPPAR uplift of 14.2% to €70.95. \nRome and Warsaw hotels perform \nIn June, Rome hoteliers increased ARR by 10.0%, but occupancy went down marginally (0.9 percentage points), which combined to result in a RevPAR uplift of 8.9% to €212.00. Apart from occupancy Rome registered positive year-on-year comparisons across all key performance indicators for the month though a decrease in meeting room hire revenue per available room of 2.9% softened the TRevPAR growth of 7.8% to €309.31. Despite overheads per available room climbing by 11.3% there was a GOPPAR increase of 11.0% to €116.95. Hotels in Warsaw also experienced a slight decrease in occupancy (0.1 percentage points) in the month of June. A 5.3% increase in ARR coupled with the 0.1 percentage point decrease in occupancy led to a 5.2% increase in RevPAR to €90.21. A 0.6 percentage point decrease in payroll also contributed to a DOPPAR and GOPPAR uplift of 3.8% to €91.80 and 3.3% to €63.45 respectively. \nIstanbul Lags behind \nHotels in Istanbul experienced challenging conditions in the month of June and reported negative year-on-year comparisons across all key performance indicators. A 1.3 percentage point drop in occupancy combined with an 11.1% decline in ARR led to a 12.8% RevPAR decrease. Mixed performances were recorded in ancillary departments and TRevPAR levels dropped by 11.5% to €151.83. With payroll going up by 4.5 percentage points, DOPPAR fell by 16.5% to €94.93. Additionally, despite a slight decrease in overheads per available room of 0.6%, Istanbul hotels’ GOPPAR declined by 25.2% compared to the same period last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:52.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
