The New York Islanders , which is owned by Shanghai-born businessman Charles Wang, picked the 18-year-old in the sixth round on June 27 . “I’m really honoured to be the first, although it will bring a lot of pressure from people back home,” he said, adding that the pressure was good because it will “motivate me to be a better player and make them (his parents) proud”. Song, who was born in Beijing, has captained the China national team for the past two years. Yu Tiande, the team leader, said: “It’s a great boost and will give our young players hope, so long as they work hard. The selection means a lot for ice hockey in China, which is dominated by Westerners.” Song started to play ice hockey at age 6 after doctors told his parents he should breathe cool air to ease a throat problem. At 10, he moved with his family to Toronto, Canada, and at 15 was enrolled at Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. He has good edge work, handles the puck well, and really is very well-positioned all the time... Etienne Bilodeau, the coach at Lawrenceville, said the teenager took up a major role after arriving at the school. This season, Song was named captain. “Given the composition of our team this year, in a lot of ways he can relate to how many minutes Duncan Keith (of the Chicago Blackhawks) logged during the (Stanley Cup) playoff,” he said. “He was pretty much on a similar ratio minute-wise for our squad. He was our go-to guy at the blue line. “His game is steady. He has good edge work, handles the puck well, and really is very well-positioned all the time in the context of anticipating and knowing how to support the offence, and knowing how to take care of his end and to be very reliable on both sides of the puck.” Song has played defence and as a forward, but said that he prefers defence, as his favourite player is former Detroit Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström. Since he will graduate this year, next season the teenager will play at Phillips Academy, a prep school in Andover, Massachusetts. “Song is a very good young player, whether you consider his fighting spirit or characteristics,” Mr Yu said. “We will continue to involve him in the national team, as long as his schedule does not clash with ours.” He said that, like Song, about 50 Chinese youngsters have moved to play ice hockey and study in North America, but most have ended up focusing more on their academic studies and eventually gave up the sport. Song was the very best of them, he said. “Song’s path can be copied, but the precondition is that the child should be enthusiastic toward the sport and should be talented.” Getting picked in the draft was only the first step for Song, Mr Yu added. “Physical condition is the key factor for a hockey player, and compared with Western players, Asian ones are not that strong. If Song wants to go further in the NHL, he has to do more physical training. His speed and flexibility, combined with a strong body, will help him.” When I started playing, there weren’t a lot of people. There wasn’t much support for the game As Beijing bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics , promoting winter sports such as ice hockey has become a major task for the country. Song said he had noticed the sport has been growing rapidly back in China: “When I started playing, there weren’t a lot of people. There wasn’t much support for the game. Last year, when I went back, it had been eight years since I had seen Chinese hockey. It was tremendous how far it’s grown. “I’m sure they will keep trying to catch up to Europe and North America and Russia. There’s still a gap, but I’m sure that if we focus on hockey we can catch up.” Mr Yu said he expected Song to be the “Yao Ming of NHL”, referring to the Chinese basketball star who played centre for the Houston Rockets. “Even if our team can’t qualify for the Olympic Games, bringing on one Chinese NHL star, like Yao Ming in the NBA, is a success,” the China team official added. “With this kind of celebrity appeal, I hope more parents will be encouraged to let their children play the sport.” READ MORE: • Budding golfer, 7, is having a ball on the course • A traditional art form takes off as economic lifeline for Chinese town • Mayor does best to make it better • Milan Expo: volunteers learn and teach in a cultural melting pot Xinhua News Agency contributed to this story.
