Here, we continue a series of get-to-know-your-opponent primers.\nToday: Arizona (Oct. 31 at Husky Stadium; TBA)\nCoach: Rich Rodriguez , fourth year (26-14 at UA; 146-98-2 career record)\n2014 record: 10-4, 7-2 Pac-12\nMost Read Stories Mariners’ triple play hadn’t been seen since 1955 Seattle police officer faces firing over arrest of man carrying golf club 5 things you should know about Microsoft’s Windows 10 Before getting the ax, Steve Sandmeyer show was scraping by Seattle’s Panama Hotel deemed a National Treasure Returning starters: 11 (6 on offense, 5 on defense)\nMain storyline: We know Scooby Wright will dress up for the part of a scary-mad man for this Halloween showdown at Husky Stadium. The Huskies figure to be, uh, out for blood, too. In Tucson last year, the Huskies had their best chance for a signature victory ripped away in the final 90 seconds, losing 27-26 in a controversial collapse . Arizona, in a charmed season, went on to win the Pac-12 South and play in the Fiesta Bowl, where it lost to Boise State, 38-30.\nKey players: Wright emerged as the nation’s most productive linebacker last season, posting 163 tackles, with 29 tackles for loss and 14 sacks, earning him All-America recognition and several national defensive player of the year awards. It was his late strip of Marcus Mariota that sealed Arizona’s upset of Oregon last year. … QB Anu Solomon , as a redshirt freshman, had a solid first season the starter in Rich Rod’s up-tempo offense, throwing 28 touchdowns against nine interceptions. Rich Rod, apparently frustrated by Solomon’s play in the Fiesta Bowl, said after the loss that Solomon would have to earn the starting gig again in spring ball. The upset coach didn’t talk to the quarterback for two weeks after the season , but Solomon was solid enough in the spring that his job is not in jeopardy this fall . … RB Nick Wilson was one of the conference’s breakout players in 2014, rushing for 1,375 yards and 16 TDs as a freshman. … The receiving corps is strong and deep, led by Cayleb Jones , Samajie Grant and Trey Griffey .\nKey questions: Even with Wright’s sensational season, the Arizona defense wound up ranked near the bottom of the Pac-12 in most categories. Improving their pass rush was one of the Wildcats’ goals in the spring, and they will have a new-look secondary this season, with DaVonte Neal shifting over from receiver to cornerback.\nSeries history: UW leads 19-11-1.\nQuotable: “He can be hard-headed at times. But just about every really good quarterback is hard-headed to some degree.” — Rodriguez, on Solomon\nAdam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
