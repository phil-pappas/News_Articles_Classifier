Source: Getty Images\nSHE’S a super-fit athlete, a Commonwealth Games silver medallist and is about to make her world championships debut.\nBut it seems whatever she does, people just can’t stop talking about high jumper Isobel Pooley’s body.\nAt 1.92m — or 6’3” — the statuesque 22-year-old Londoner is tall, but she just wants people to get over it.\n“People swear and say: ‘She’s huge, have you seen that girl over there?’ And I want to turn round and say: ‘I’m not deaf,’” she told BBC Sport .\n“It’s a part of my daily life. They say: ‘How tall are you?’ or just make pointless comments that don’t go anywhere like ‘You’re really tall aren’t you?’ ‘Aren’t you tall?’ ‘You’re massive.’\n“People are just so rude without realising. They assume that it’s OK to point it out. It’s not kind ever to stop and stare at people, but that’s what us tall people have to endure.”\nPeople are also quick to point out to Pooley her height could be a problem when trying to land a date.\n“I hate it when people say: ‘How are you ever going to find a boyfriend?’ assuming that he has to be taller. Why do we have to think the man has to be the big guy? There are big women and small men.”\nPooley says she admires tennis star Serena Williams because “she is a goddess in her body”.\n“She is big compared to your average woman, but nobody would say she is not beautiful,” she said.\n“Her beauty is practical too, where you are not judging it on what it looks like but what it can do, and I think that’s a really healthy principle to take into wider society.\n“For me it’s not about looking thin, it’s about jumping high. If I reach the point where I’m super light and unhealthy, that’s not a positive situation to be in. It’s about being the best athlete I can be.”\nPooley after winning silver in the women’s high jump final at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games.
