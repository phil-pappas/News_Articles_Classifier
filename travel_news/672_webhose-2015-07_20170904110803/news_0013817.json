More Merlin shares tumble on profit warning \nStarwood may be conducting parallel talks with other interested parties, one person added, with candidates likely to include US hotel group Wyndham. \nIHG said in a statement that it is not currently “in talks with Starwood with a view to a combination of the businesses”. \nStarwood in effect put itself up for sale in April, appointing Lazard to explore a “full range” of strategic and financial options. The move came after Frits van Paasschen, Starwood’s former chief executive, quit in February as the company struggled to maintain growth. \nStarwood is hoping to decide on a path by the end of the year but offered no guidance at its second-quarter results on Thursday. \nRichard Solomons, the chief executive of IHG , declined to comment on Starwood as he reported a 21.5 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits to $458m. A Starwood spokesman also declined to comment. \nMr Solomons said IHG’s strategy was to grow organically. He said the company had signed deals to manage 231 hotels in the first half. \n“There is a lot of noise around consolidation. If you look back a few years it was real; now it is effectively organic,” he said. “We have had extensive organic consolidation: we signed more deals in the first half than any time since 2008, we are building new brands and buying up little brands like Kimpton.” \nThe hotel industry in the US, UK and Europe is 10-15 per cent above its 2007 peak in terms of revenue per available room, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. The fizz in the sector has seen a wave of recent deal making and property sales, including the launch of a £1bn-plus hotel group in the UK by Lone Star, the Dallas-based private equity group, this month. \nShares in both companies rose Thursday. Starwood shares were up 1.4 per cent to $83.80 in late-morning trading, and IHG shares surged 4.6 per cent to close at £27.43 after the Financial Times reported the talks. \nIHG is working with advisers including Bank of America Merrill Lynch on its talks with Starwood, said one person close to situation. \nStarwood’s market capitalisation is $13.8bn, while IHG’s is roughly $9.5bn, but Starwood filed plans last month to spin off its vacation timeshare business into a separate publicly traded business. <!--.--> \nThe two companies have complementary portfolios, analysts have said. Starwood owns the Le Méridien, St Regis and W brands and has 1,207 hotels, three-quarters of them in the luxury sector. \nInterContinental Hotels franchises, manages or leases 4,800 hotels in 100 countries with brands in its portfolio including Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Kimpton. \nIn July IHG sold the InterContinental Hong Kong , valued on its books for $298m, for $938m. Mr Solomons said he would not disclose how they planned to spend that cash until its full-year results in February. \n“We don’t say what we are going to do with it until we have got the money. So on February 16, when we know we have got it, we will say. But you know our track record – we have returned $10bn to shareholders,” he said. \nPeople familiar with the matter have said previously that Wyndham informally approached IHG about a potential £6bn takeover last year.
