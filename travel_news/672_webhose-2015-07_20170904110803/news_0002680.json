Flagship Facility Services of San Jose, California, won the $8 million annual contract as part of a more extensive Request for Proposal process. The company replaces New York-based Triangle Services , which had kept the airport clean for 34 years. Triangle Services informed the state of impending layoffs through the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, commonly called a WARN notice. The company’s contract ends on Sept. 30, at which time all employees will be let go. But TIA spokeswoman Emily Nipps said that Flagship, as part of the RFP agreement, would interview displaced workers and make efforts to retain a significant number of them. Triangle leaves with 120 full-time and 90 part-time positions. Flagship’s deal calls for 152 full-timers, and is not specific about the number of part-time jobs. TIA has used its massive master redevelopment plan as a vehicle to bring in a slew of new companies and redo a number of contracts, most recently a complete overhaul of airport concessions . Triangle had maintained its position by constantly coming in as a low bidder in what were generally five-year contracts. The janitorial-services RFP upped the requirements for Women and Minority Business Enterprise participation from 8 to 20 percent. Flagship met that threshold by subcontracting Florida Cleaning Systems of Altamonte Springs, which will mostly do night work. “When the RFP came up, I went out into the community with our maintenance director and let [minority businesses] know there was a new opportunity,” Nipps said. \nWant Tampa Bay Logistics & Transportation  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:33:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
