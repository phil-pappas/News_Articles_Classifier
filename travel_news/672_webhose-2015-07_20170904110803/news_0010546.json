The national average cost for domestic airfare is projected to drop to its lowest in four years according to airfare prediction company Hopper.\nHopper's Consumer Airfare Index report predicts a national average of $248 for domestic airfare, a 3.6 percent decrease from last fall's average ticket price of $257 and an 8.1 percent decrease from 2013, in which airfare topped $270.\nTicket prices out of Denver International Airport are expected to be below the national average this fall at $201, according to the report.\n\"The price level is a bit lower in Denver,\" said Tyler Hanson, data scientist at Hopper. \"The Denver airport is a big hub, and it's in the middle of the U.S, making it more affordable for consumers to reach each coast.\"\nHopper's Consumer Airfare Index forecasts price changes for leisure travelers using search engine data and the number of tickets available, measuring what would be a typical affordable fare in a market. It doesn't factor in more expensive business fares, baggage or upgrade fees.\nLower airfares are expected this fall because of decreased fuel prices, an increase in available seats, increased consumer confidence and the aggressive expansion of low-cost carriers, Hanson said.\nTicket prices are anticipated to decline sharply through the rest of the summer before stabilizing this fall and winter.\nIn June, the average fare out of DIA was $226, compared with $246 the previous year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:38:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
