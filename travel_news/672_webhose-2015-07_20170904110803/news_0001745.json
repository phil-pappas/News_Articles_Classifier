If recorded without the person’s knowledge, they must consent to the broadcast.\nIt marks the third time the Australian Communications and Media Authority has slapped 2DayFM with additional licence conditions over controversial behaviour, with the two previous instances both relating to former presenter Kyle Sandilands.\nIn the December 2012 call, hosts Michael Christian and Mel Greig phoned the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness, impersonating the Queen and Prince Charles.\nOne of the nurses who answered the call, Jacintha Saldanha, later committed suicide.\nIn its investigation, ACMA found 2DayFM breached its licence conditions by broadcasting the statements of identifiable people without their knowledge or consent, and by treating participants in live-hosted entertainment programs from being “treated in a highly demeaning or highly exploitative manner”.\nAs part of the agreement, 2DayFM will broadcast a three-hour special program “produced to promote media ethics and raise public awareness of the signs and risks of bullying, depression and anxiety”, with all advertising either suspended or proceeds donated to charity.\nRecognising that 2DayFM is the only station to have been imposed with additional licence conditions, ACMA has also accepted an enforceable undertaking that all 2DayFM presenters, production and management will be required to attend an ethics training course.\n“The combined approach of the special broadcast and targeted training program, together with the imposition of a new licence condition, presents a positive alternative to what would have otherwise been a brief suspension of 2DayFM’s licence,” ACMA Chairman Chris Chapman said in a statement.\n“This is a much more constructive way of ensuing future compliance by 2DayFM with important community safeguards.”\nMr Chapman said the community had a “right to expect that broadcasters will not record and broadcast private conversations where consent has not been given”.\n“It heralds a positive approach that the new board and management of 2DayFM have acknowledged and apologised for 2DayFM’s actions, accepted the ACMA’s breach findings, committed to ethical behaviour and regulatory compliance going forward and, through this special program, will seek to proactively address important societal issues including media ethics,” he said.\n“These really are matters of genuine, current public concern and debate, and this contribution to the ongoing conversation is, in the ACMA’s view, better than the silence that would have been the result if the ACMA had suspended the licence for a brief time.”\nOriginally published as 2DayFM survives Royal Prank call", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/dayfm-survives-royal-prank-call/story-fnki1jcy-1227445647206"], "published": "2015-07-17T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:14:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
