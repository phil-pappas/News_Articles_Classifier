A fast food chain in Hong Kong offers set menus with a choice of French fries and green salads. By subsituting the salad for the fries, you'll cut your calorie count in half!

And this was his response: \n\"A hamburger would be a very good choice! Hamburgers get a bad rap. The only thing wrong with a hamburger is that most people eat them with French fries, which is bad, because they are deep fat fried. If you eat a hamburger with a green salad instead of French fries, you've got a well-balanced meal.\" \nAnother personal trainer weighed in on the same topic. \n\"I'm not saying you should eat them every day, but when you crave a hamburger, my advice is to go to McDonald's,\" he said. \n\"Contrary to popular belief, their hamburgers are better for you than the hamburgers at fancy restaurants. The reason is that McDonald's uses leaner beef because it is cheaper. Expensive restaurants use beef that has a higher fat content because it's tastier. But it's also not as good for you as the leaner cuts of beef that McDonald's uses.\" \nThat advice was fine in San Francisco, where McDonald's and most other fast food chains offer at least one set meal with a healthy alternative to French fries. But it is not the case in Hong Kong. \nIntroducing Mos Burger Mos Hamburger Hong Kong in Kwuntong on the Kowloon Peninsula.

And set meals always represent better value. \nIf you order a burger and a soft drink ala carte, you feel as though you're getting ripped off because it costs almost as much as the set menu, which includes French fries. \nSometimes the price is equal. So you end up ordering the set menu so as not to feel cheated. \nWhich brings me to Mos Burger, a Japanese hamburger chain with only a handful of outlets in Hong Kong. \nMos Burger offers diners a choice. You can choose between French fries and a green salad - both for the same price! You can also opt for iced tea rather than a soft drink at a HK$3 surcharge. \nThe no-nonsense Mos Burger is my favourite. In addition to the beef patty and the bun is a thick slice of tomato and that yummy sauce, which defies description. I honestly have no idea what's in it. But it sure is tasty! \nCalorie Count A Mos Burger with a green salad and iced lemon tea.

But I think it's much tastier. AND check this out ... \nBy swapping your French fries for a green salad, you will cut your total calorie count for the meal in half! Not to mention an even greater reduction in your total fat input! Plus you're getting some fibre. \nOkay. I'm the first to admit that a Mos Burger cannot compete with a Whopper or a Quarter Pounder on taste. But it CAN satisfy your hunger for a burger - without the guilt! \nPlease note: the advice I received had nothing to do with weight loss. I had just finished a VERY intensive session of circuit training, and the trainer said it was important eat a hearty (but healthy) meal following such a workout. \nWhere \nMos Burger Hong Kong, APM, 418 Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.
