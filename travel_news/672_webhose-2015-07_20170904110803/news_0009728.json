The ship supported the Parks Canada-led effort that found Sir John Franklin's ship HMS Erebus in the Queen Maud Gulf.\nThe exhibit includes artifacts from explorer Roald Amundsen's ship Maud and from the RCMP schooner St. Roch, which sailed through the Northwest Passage in the 1940s, said the museum, which is partnering with One Ocean Expeditions on the project.\nFares for the 13-day mid-August cruise from Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, to Cambridge Bay range from US$8,395 to US$14,995, according to One Ocean Expeditions' website: www.oneoceanexpeditions.com.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T05:46:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
