This Collision Call also sends an e-mail to family, work and friends, allowing them to take immediate action . This saves crucial t i me which is vital after a crash. Simply speaking, the app measures G-forces which occur during a collision. If those forces exceed a certain level, dangerous to humans, the app automatically calls the alarm number in the country you are in and sends e-mails to programmed contacts. To prevent this from happening when someone is dropping or tossing away his phone, the app only works after driving above 30 kilometres an hour for ten seconds. Each year 1.3 million people die in road traffic crashes and 50 million get injured or become disabled. Currently, some expensive cars have in-built systems which alert alarm services. The EU has declared regulation which requires all new cars to be equipped with the Ecall emergency alert system from 2018. This systems calls 112 after collision sensors and airbags detect a car has crashed. The EU expects to save 2,500 of the current 25,000 traffic victims each year. The Collision Call app provides a safe and cheap alternative and also works in second hand cars, Dutch inventor Ramon Veneman of Collision Call states. \"I believe it can save many lives. Surveys show 60 percent of all traffic victims die at high speed collisions. That is what this app is programmed for.\"Collision Call - available in Google Play and very soon in the Apple store - also works when driving a motorcycle, scooter, truck, bus or even travelling by train. It doesn't matter in which country the accident happens, because Collision Call works in 144 countries worldwide and is available in 9 languages. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:11:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
