The project, funded entirely by Union Pacific without taxpayer dollars, began June 24 and is scheduled to be completed the end of July.\nThe railroad will replace 36,000 railroad ties, install 21,700 tons of rock ballast and replace more than a quarter of a mile of rail in various curves. In addition, crews will repair the surfaces at 58 road crossings. The project is one of nearly 1,500 Union Pacific will complete across its 32,000-mile network this year to help improve train operating efficiency, reduce motorist wait times at crossings and enhance safety.\n“Union Pacific helps businesses connect with consumers, suppliers and markets across the nation and around the world,” said Donna Kush, Union Pacific vice president – Public Affairs, Northern Region. “In addition to helping move our customers’ goods safely and efficiently, our investments support communities by reducing traffic congestion, facilitating industrial development and promoting economic expansion.”\nThe railroad plans to invest $119 million in 2015 to improve Illinois’ transportation infrastructure. The planned investment covers a range of initiatives: nearly $105 million to maintain railroad track, $5 million to enhance signal systems and $9 million to maintain or replace bridges in the state.\nUnion Pacific plans to spend $4.2 billion across its network this year, following investments totaling more than $31 billion from 2005-2014. These investments contributed to a 38 percent decrease in derailments over the last 10 years.\nRelated Posts CN offers conductors’ union in Canada one last chance to reach a contract settlement through negotiation; requires upfront union acceptance of binding arbitration if talks fail Dangerous behaviour at level crossings caught on dash cam ShipCarsNow Receives 2013 Better Business Bureau Integrity Award Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units The Slopes are Calling!
