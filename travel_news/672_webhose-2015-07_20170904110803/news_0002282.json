Edward Poland, Co-Founder, Hire Space said: “The Tower of London is one of our most imposing venues and one of the country’s most iconic structures. It is wonderful that for corporate and private events, guests can have a closer look at the building’s innovative Norman military architecture and Crown Jewels.” Milan Thakrar, Business Development Manager, Functions & Events, at Historic Royal Palaces said: “We were delighted to open our gates to event professionals within the city who are influential in booking event spaces for meetings and events. The event has been a true success; we wanted to offer clients a unique experience with the tour of the Crown Jewels but also educate clients on the various daytime meeting and conferencing facilities available at the Tower of London.” Hire Space started as a way to drive revenue in schools and other public sector spaces, and is now used by leading businesses and the public to find unusual venues for events, product launches, conferencing and promotional activities.
