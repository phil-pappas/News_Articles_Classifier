It will be turned on at sunset on July 7.\nThe park service said much of the lighting system was installed below ground and damaged in Superstorm Sandy. Musco had installed a temporary system.\nThe new permanent system is expected to reduce energy consumption.\nMusco systems are also in place at the Washington Monument, the White House and the Flight 93 National Memorial.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:46:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
