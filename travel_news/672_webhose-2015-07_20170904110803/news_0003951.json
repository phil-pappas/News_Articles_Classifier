On Tuesday, Steve Sisneros , director of airport affairs for Southwest Airlines Co. , said a group assigned to study the issue recommended moving ahead with a pair of single-terminal options City spokesman Chris Hernandez said the presentation if not a formal recommendation of action for the Kansas City Council. Sisneros said Southwest originally thought a renovation of the existing three-terminal layout would be cheaper. But he said he has learned that renovating would cost more than $1 billion. A rebuild, he said, will be cheaper. He did not give a cost estimate or a time frame for a rebuild. The group has made a recommendation, Sisneros said during a meeting Tuesday, but the group hasn't made a deal yet. The decision is not final, a city official said, but a final resolution is expected before May 2016. \nWant Kansas City Logistics & Transportation   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T23:53:43.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
