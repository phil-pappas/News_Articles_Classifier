Chefs vetted by EatWith put together dinners based on whatever inspires them and menus are listed on the EatWith site. The fun starts when you search for menus in your city (or whatever city you happen to be in). Once you find one that intrigues you, make a reservation and the host will send you the address. It’s a fun mix of good food with a dash of intrigue. Image: Didriks, Toasting the Entree via Flickr CC BY 2.0 What’s better than a pop-up restaurant? A pop-up beach of course.

Each picnic features a food vendor, live entertainment, games and tables, chairs and picnic blankets.
