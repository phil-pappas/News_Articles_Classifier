Nation photo/Chularat Saengpassa \nA kitchen garden is common for the local village of Ban Takientia, Pattaya, Chon Buri Province. Coming togther with many varieties of herb and vegetation, the kitchen garden contributes to local cooking. Nation photo/Chularat Saengpassa A local community in Pattaya has much more to share with visitors to the resort than beach parties Pattaya , one of Thailand's hottest beach destinations, has long sought to draw visitors with its promises of sand, sea and vibrant nightlife. Yet there is much more to the resort than what sits on the surface. In a small and largely unknown corner of the city, for instance, locals are using the simple life to lure tourists. The residents of Ban Takientia, a mere 10-minutes drive from the city centre, are justifiably proud of their food as well as their ability to be truly self-sufficient. Made with the resources available in the village, the dishes they offer are not only authentic in terms of taste but also nutritious. Like several villages around Pattaya , Ban Takientia is a major supplier of fresh coconut juice and so it comes as no surprise that a signature dish here is green chicken curry with soft coconut shell. And there's no need to rush back to the bright lights after a leisurely meal. Visitors can kick back, chill out and get a true sense of life in Thailand by staying the night in a small, purpose built inn that offers two rooms, the one with a fan going for just Bt250 and the air conditioned unit for Bt350. The powerhouse behind the village's initiative to establish a sustainable tourism business venture under the guidance of the Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration (Public Organisation) or Dasta, is Nattakarn \"Ket\" Prakobtham, 51, who moved from Bangkok a few years back and set herself up as a farmer. Today, every resident has joined Ket in growing fruit and vegetables on their land. Food is prepared with the ingredients grown and the reminder is packed in bags and sold for prices way below those found in supermarkets. \"It's a healthy environment. We breathe in fresh air and eat clean food. The ingredients available dictate what we will cook on any given day, \" says Ket, who has turned her family house into a cultural learning centre to share knowledge with visitors. The home she shares with her two younger sisters is itself a cultural attraction and is made up of a series of houses with connected roofs supported by 104 posts. The small building next door, in which the tourist accommodation is located, is simple but spotless. \"We didn't invest much. All the stuff here we already had,\" Ket says as she shows us around the two guestrooms, one of which easily accommodates a family of six. A refrigerator stands outside and is stocked with water and herbal drinks that can be enjoyed for free. After a good night's sleep, visitors are invited to join gardening activities and pick the ingredients they want for breakfast. They are even welcome in the kitchen to cook for themselves if the mood takes them. The variety of raw ingredients grown in the 6-rai garden is huge and visitors can tuck into such delicacies as stir-fried laffa or help knock up a spicy nam phrik (chilli dip) made with zalacca or snake fruit. Part of the property is reserved for Chinese bamboo trees and these yield crunchy bamboo shoots almost daily. Later in the day, visitors can sign up for a cooking class and learn how to make a variety of Thai-style jellies and savouries. Or they can experience a massage known as \"gauza\", which uses animal bones to help release the toxins from the blood. The masseuses press the bones on the skin, making way for the poisons to float and leave the body. A few hundred metres away at the community enterprise centre, visitors can watch coconut oil being extracted from the fruit and a bottle makes a great souvenir. Ket's sister Wandee, who serves as the spokesperson for the community, says that three households have already joined the tourism network and are ready to provide visitors with homestays, food and village experiences. Ket is looking for more members as well as new attractions. Together, they can accommodate up to 50 visitors. However, advance booking is a must, as the hosts need time to prepare. Day-trippers are also welcome with 60 visitors welcome at any one time. \"We don't want to over-stretch ourselves,\" Wandee says. \"Tourism generates extra income for us and allows us share stories of our everyday life. But while visitors are always welcome, we can't let tourism come in the way of our daily routines.
