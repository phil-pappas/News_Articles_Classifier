In particular IPG’s brand new, extensive outdoor LED fleet has been used at a range of high profile events in recent weeks, including Goodwood Festival of Speed, Wimbledon, The Open and Paris Airshow. \nDarren Poultney, Managing Director of Smart AV and founder of IPG, says: “Outdoor LED walls have been around for some time but with improved resolution and brightness and new applications to engage visitors, demand for the latest LED technology is hugely increasing. With our extensive R&D into the product’s design, we are also able to install and de-rig the equipment much quicker, making a major outdoor LED wall a far more attractive option at events that previously might not have considered it. Rather encouragingly, we’re finding that outdoor LED is not just a product suited to summer events, as demand for the product in the winter months is proving to be equally high.” IPG recently invested in significant stock of high resolution, 5.9mm outdoor and 3.9mm indoor LED in response to this increased demand and is now able to offer some 400 square metres of LED to cater for the largest event requirements. The 5.9mm high resolution of the outdoor LED screens ensures much higher clarity of visibility, even from a short distance and in bright natural lighting conditions. The new screens can also be curved in both convex and concave formations of up to 15 degrees on each angle, which adds a new dimension to the display and has already proven popular with sponsors and advertisers. Pop up event to showcase range of LED IPG will be hosting a summer pop up event at its Harlow-based warehouse facility to showcase its new LED stock and provide an opportunity for production companies, agencies and end-user clients to get hands on with the equipment without the pressure of running a live event. The summer pop-up will run for two weeks from Monday 27th July to Friday 7th August and incorporates unique interactive experiences, indoor and outdoor LED displays and a personalised walk-through of the range of equipment available.
