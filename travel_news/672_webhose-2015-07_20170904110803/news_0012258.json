David Cameron has said that the government will not respond to a report saying the new runway needed for the south of England should be built at Heathrow until later this year. ( See 1.49pm.) Cameron has dropped a heavy hint that members of parliament could meet in the House of Lords chamber while the Commons chamber undergoes much-needed maintenance work.

This is from its chair, David Holmes.\nFive years ago, all the main political parties promised to act to end child poverty by 2020. Today the government decided to pull the teeth from the Child Poverty Act, and break its promise to the millions of children who live in poverty in Britain today.\nThe government has proposed to remove the current definition of poverty in the Child Poverty Act and to remove legally binding targets to reduce the number children living in low income families. By replacing them with duties to report on worklessness and poor educational attainment, the government has made the extraordinary step of no longer recognising that child poverty is, at its heart, about families not having enough money to live on.\nPerhaps most importantly the government has indicated it will abandon its goal of tackling low income poverty amongst the more than two million children who live in poverty in working families. With nearly two thirds of children in poverty in working families, this simply makes no sense.\nThe End Child Poverty Coalition exists in order to ensure that the government keeps the promise to end child poverty by 2020. We will continue to work with Parliamentarians to keep the government to this goal.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.07pm BST 16:07\nStephen Timms , the acting shadow work and pensions secretary, has put out a formal response to the plan to replace the Child Poverty Act. Here’s an excerpt.\nDavid Cameron’s government is trying to make child poverty go away by pretending that if you don’t measure it, it doesn’t exist. The Tory manifesto promised to ‘eliminate child poverty’. But now Tory ministers are trying to change the definition of child poverty to hide the government’s lack of progress.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.59pm BST 15:59\nAlan Milburn , the former Labour cabinet minister who chairs the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, has put out a fairly nuanced statement about the government’s decision to replace the Child Poverty Act (and give the commission a new name).\nIn a nutshell, Milburn:\nBacks the idea of focusing on new measures relating to life chances, but says there must be a target for improving life chances. Insists that income should remain a key factor when poverty is measured. Urges the government to develop an anti-poverty strategy, arguing that doing something about poverty is more important than measuring it. Says the commission will carry on “as usual” despite the government wanting to rename it.\nHere is the statement in full.\nIt has long been obvious that the existing child poverty targets are not going to be met. In fact they will be missed by a country mile. The commission has argued in the past that a more rounded way of measuring poverty – taking greater account of causal risk factors – is sensible. The life chances of children, the poorest especially, depend on many things including good parenting, childcare, education and employment. For that reason we welcome the new legal duties on worklessness and educational attainment. It is not credible, however, to try to improve the life chances of the poor without acknowledging the most obvious symptom of poverty, lack of money. Unless the government sets out a clear target for improving the life chances of the poorest families, its agenda for healing social division in our country will lack both ambition and credibility.\nAbolishing the legal targets doesn’t make the issue of child poverty go away. It remains a deep scar in the fabric of our nation. The key issue is less how child poverty is measured and more how it is tackled. Far more needs to be done to make sure that the poorest families share in the proceeds of economic growth. When two in three poor children are nowadays in families where someone is in work, the priority has to be to tackle in-work poverty. That’s why we look to the Government to champion the living wage and to ensure that welfare cuts do not fall exclusively on the working poor. The risk is otherwise that child poverty - regardless of how it is measured - will go on rising, not falling.\nWe welcome the government’s commitment to continued independent scrutiny of progress in relation to social mobility, life chances and poverty. Ultimately, it is a matter for parliament to determine the basis on which the Commission operates, but in the meantime the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission will continue to function on its present basis. We will publish our annual State of the Nation report in the autumn as usual.\nAlan Milburn Photograph: Richard Gardner/REX/Richard Gardner/REX Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.42pm BST 15:42\nHere’s my colleague Tom Clark on Iain Duncan Smith’s redefinition of poverty.\n— Tom Clark (@guardian_clark) July 1, 2015 Working poverty is now the chief poverty problem.

Only a year ago, the secretary of state claimed the child poverty targets would be met but last week’s child poverty statistics showed that absolute child poverty has risen by half a million since 2010 and that progress on relative poverty has stalled.\nToday’s statement isn’t about strengthening efforts to end child poverty but about burying the failure of the government’s child poverty approach. And with more cuts coming down the line, child poverty is set to rise.\nTwo thirds of poor children are in working families – it’s unclear whether these children will be counted as poor in the future ...

He said he would replace the Child Poverty Act targets with legislation giving the government a duty to report on progress against other indicators. But he did not describe these as targets. He said:\nToday, I am announcing that we will bring forward legislation to remove the existing measures and targets in the Child Poverty Act, as well as the other duties and provisions.\nHowever, the legislation will at the same time introduce a statutory duty to report on measures of:\nworklessness\nand educational attainment\nThe worklessness measures will identify the proportion of children living in workless households, and the proportion of children in long-term workless households.\nThe educational attainment measures will focus on GCSE attainment for all pupils and for disadvantaged pupils.\nThe worklessness and education measures will reflect the agreed responsibilities in the Devolution Agreement.\nHe said the government would continue to publish the annual households below average income (HBAI) figures (the conventional poverty figures). He said new measures would also be developed relating to “the root causes of poverty”.\nAlongside the statutory measures, we will develop a range of other indicators to measure the progress against the root causes of poverty.\nWe know that in households with unstable relationships, where debt and addiction destabilise families, where parents lack employment skills, that these children don’t have the same chances in life as other children.\nThey cannot break out of the cycle of disadvantage.\nWe are currently developing these measures, including family breakdown, problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency.\nWe will report each year on these life chances measures as well.\nHe said the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission would become the Social Mobility Commission. He said the relative income measure of child poverty was unsatisfactory.\nThe problem with a statutory framework set around the relative income measure has become all too apparent.\nAt 60% of median income:\nIf you sit below the line, you are said to be poor. If you sit above it, you are not.\nHe said focusing on relative income led the last Labour to spend money inefficiently.\nFor example, we saw massive spikes in tax credit spending in the run up to election years:\nIn the 2 years before the 2005 election it increased by nearly £10bn\nIn the 2 years before the 2010 election it increased by nearly £6bn\nFrom 2002 to 2010, spending on tax credits more than doubled, from £14bn to £31bn most of this due to child tax credit.\nLooking at welfare overall - spending increased by 60% in real terms under the last government.\nDriven by the need to chase a moving line.\nBut, despite all this, the number of workless households doubled under Labour and in-work poverty rose, he said.\nHe said focusing on relative poverty also meant that positive developments in the economy could increase poverty.\nWe had reached the position where a growing economy drives increases in the measure of child poverty …\n… whilst, if the economy crashes as happened under Labour, child poverty apparently falls.\nEven today, if we increase the state pension we run the risk of increasing the median income and thus increasing the number of households in poverty.\nIain Duncan Smith Photograph: Rex Shutterstock/Rex Shutterstock Updated at 3.21pm BST\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.28pm BST 14:28\nFrank Field , the Labour MP, former welfare minister and new chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, has welcomed Iain Duncan Smith’s announcement.

We have now heard from David Cameron and Patrick McLoughlin , the transport secretary. So what have we learnt?\nOfficially, not much. But if you apply the skills of parliamentary cryptology, some interesting clues have emerged. Perhaps the Ladbrokes 3/1 odds on Gatwick (see 11.37am) are not so generous after all.\nHere are the key points.\nMinisters have said they will announce a decision on the new runway (ie, whether to go for Heathrow or Gatwick) by the autumn. Cameron said that a decision would be made “by the end of the year”, but McLoughlin said the government would come back in the autumn. Cameron claimed that he could not commit himself at this point because, if he did, he would leave the government open to a legal challenge via judicial review. This sounded at least as much like a delaying tactic, as a genuine concern. When Harriet Harman first asked about the Davies report, Cameron replied:\nI think there is a lot of common ground across all sides of the House, or almost all sides of the House, that there is the need for additional airport capacity in the south east of England, not least to maintain this country’s competitiveness. But it is important now there is a very detailed report that we study it and I am very clear about the legal position, that if we say anything now before studying the report, actually you can endanger whatever decision is made.\nBut Cameron then dropped a couple of hints that suggest he is Heathrow-leaning. First, when Harman asked him about the briefing suggesting he would oppose Heathrow (see 8.13am) , Cameron replied:\nI would have thought with all your years of experience, you would know not to believe everything you read in your morning’s newspapers - it would probably be good for your blood pressure if you didn’t, as well as good for mine.\nAnd then later, in response to a question from the Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, he said this.\nIf you make some precipitate decision or rule out one particular option you will actually make the decision you would like to make impossible to achieve because of judicial review.\nIt is very hard to know what this implies, but it is at least as likely that this implies pro-Heathrow thinking as pro-Gatwick thinking, because the prospect of the Heathrow decision being undermined by judicial review seems higher (because of the environmental issues).\nMcLoughlin said that Cameron’s “no ifs, not buts” promise to block a third runway at Heathrow (see 9.01am) no longer applied. Asked about this, he said:\nI think what the prime was talking about initially was a proposal which was put forward by [Labour] which was not a proper proposal and would not have answered the question as far as capacity is concerned.\nMcLoughlin also hinted that he favoured Heathrow in response to a question from Kenneth Clark. Clarke said the government was elected in order to deliver a modern, competitive economy for future generations, and he said that decisions on infrastructure should be taken in the national interest. He was clearly implying that local concerns should not be allowed to block Heathrow. McLoughlin said:\nI think [Clarke] makes a number of points that we do have to bear in mind, and it is a pity that progress has no been made on some of these subjects sooner.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.14pm BST 13:14\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP and mayoral hopeful, asks if McLoughlin will take into account the jobs that could be created by Heathrow expansion, and not just the interests of Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith.\nMcLoughlin points out that Sadiq Kahn opposes Heathrow expansion.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.07pm BST 13:07\nDominic Grieve , the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, says his constituents will have mixed views on Heathrow expansion.

They have caused a lot of anxiety in this parish especially among older people. They should have told us so people could get on with their lives.”\nHe said he does not want to be the last of 50 vicars to serve the village over close to a 1,000 years and said that he has even seen some in his congregation question their faith in God over the runway issue.\nIn the middle of the village residents have erected a mural showing where the new runway would be and how the airport perimeter would be 30 yards from where historic wisteria-clad cottages currently stand. They have also planted “a forest of defiance” on the recreational ground that would become the runway with oaks, hornbeams and field maples. But the destruction of the village is moving closer.

The Davies Commission has so far completely fudged the central question of whether we need a new runway at all. London already has one of the biggest airport systems in the world with six runways and five airports. And the aviation lobby’s favourite economic argument ignores that business flights are declining. The solution is not to build more tarmac strips but to manage demand. And one way to do this is to make flight taxes fairer so that the burden is shifted from families flying on an annual holiday onto frequent fliers who are driving the expansion and pushing up carbon emissions.\nAnd this is from Friends of the Earth ’s head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton.\nThis report vacillates over a false choice - expansion at Heathrow or Gatwick - when neither can be allowed if we’re to stop runaway global warming.\nBuilding a new runway at Gatwick or Heathrow would have a hugely damaging impact on local people and their environment and would be a step backwards in UK efforts to tackle climate change.\nAirport expansion also risks worsening local air pollution levels which already breach legal limits.\nThe UK will be a laughing stock if it turns up at crucial climate talks in Paris later this year, claiming global leadership while at home having nodded through new runways, killed its onshore wind industry and foisted fracking on communities that don’t want it.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.08am BST 10:08\nBusiness groups back Heathrow expansion The Davies recommendation for Heathrow is popular with business.

Here are the key points.\nDavies said that David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” promise in 2009 to block a third runway at Heathrow applied to a different plan.\nThe proposal in place then was a deficient proposal; it did not offer the economic advantages of this proposal. It was a short runway to the north of Heathrow, really focussed just on regional links, there was none of the proposals that we are making about the noise framework for the airport, the air quality framework. So, I think the prime minister has a very different proposition to look at today.\nDavies summarised the benefits of Heathrow.\nThe economic benefits of expanding Heathrow are much greater than from any other of the options. Heathrow offers the kind of long haul connectivity flights to emerging markets which are very important to the future of the British economy, and expanding it would allow Heathrow to offer more of those flights, Gatwick is much more focussed on short haul intra-European flying. Heathrow is also, by a long, long way, the centre for air freight, which is increasingly important particularly to those markets, and there is a network of logistics companies around Heathrow which support the airport, so you’d get a big boost to air freight exports as well. Those are the principle arguments.\nHe insisted that the conditions being imposed on Heathrow expansion would make the airport “a much better neighbour” for residents.\nWe have made it clear that we think the airport must operate in a very different way in future, if it is to gain enough support from its local communities to expand. We have taken our cue here by a campaign run by Hounslow council actually which is called ‘better not bigger’. But in our view, the airport can get better if it becomes bigger.\nSo, we have recommended a lot of things, some of which the airport I think will not particularly like, for example a ban on night flights before 6am. We think those are the flights that are particularly annoying too local people, that the airport should operate within a noise envelope, its noise should be no greater than it is today. There should be a noise levy on passengers passing through the airport, and a lot of other things that we think will make the airport a much better neighbour than it has been in the past.\nHe said Gatwick was still an option for government.\nLet me be very clear. If you ask me is ‘Gatwick a conceivable option’ then the answer to that is yes.\nBut the commission thought Heathrow would be better, he said.\nHe accused Boris Johnson of failing to come up with a “plausible” alternative.\n[Johnson’s] made a lot of phrases during this debate but not actually come up with a plausible proposal for something that would actually expand London’s capacity in an economically helpful way.\nI’ve taken the Quote: s from PoliticsHome.\nSir Howard Davies speaking at a news conference this morning.

The real issue now is this is now a decision for the government and there are many many people in the cabinet that are opposed to this.\nAnd this is from Paul McGuinness, a spokesman for Teddington Action Group , a local group campaigning against noise and pollution from Heathrow.\nIt’s incredible that a government which has recently been legally bound by the supreme court to improve air quality to meet EU directives can even begin to consider a third runway at Heathrow, an area which currently exceeds all limit values on toxic emissions.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.36am BST 08:36\nGatwick says it is “still in the race” for the new runway. This is from Gatwick Airport ’s chief executive, Stewart Wingate.\nGatwick is still very much in the race. The commission’s report makes clear that expansion at Gatwick is deliverable. It is for the commission to make a recommendation but it is of course for the government to decide.\nSo we now enter the most important stage of the process. We are confident that when the government makes that decision they will choose Gatwick as the only deliverable option.\nFor instance, this report highlights the very significant environmental challenges at Heathrow such as air quality and noise impact.Gatwick will give the country the economic benefits it needs and at the same time impact far less people. It is quicker simpler and quieter. Above all - after decades of delay - it can actually happen.\nAn aerial view of Gatwick Airport in Sussex.

It might have been allowed in China in the 1950s, but it is not deliverable now.\nThe long-term solution lies in the Thames estuary.\nQ: Davies rejected that. Was it a mistake to promote the Thames estuary, when you should have focused on Gatwick.\nJohnson says Gatwick is a bad option, but Heathrow is much worse.\nHe predicts that eventually the Thames estuary option will be seen as the best one.\nDavies was set up to provide “a fig leaf for an an establishment U-turn” on Heathrow.\nJohnson says, if the third runway goes ahead, the number of people affected by noise in London will go up to 1m.\nQ: But there are restrictions proposed in the report to address that.\nJohnson says he does not think the restrictions would have that effect. And he does not think the restrictions would even be imposed anyway.\nThis is “fundamentally exacerbating a planning error” made in the 1950s, he says.\nThe best solution would be to build something that goes beyond 2030.\nQ: What will happen if David Cameron backs Heathrow?\nJohnson says we are not at that stage yet.

They should how disruptive this would be.\nHolland-Kaye was being evasive on noise, he says.\nAnd the report only applies for 15 years.\nQ: Davies says a law should be passed banning a fourth runway.\nJohnson says no parliament can bind its successor.

This is what previous reports have suggested. For example, this is from last weekend’s Sunday Times (paywall).\nAides to David Cameron have told Tory MPs that the prime minister is reluctant to break his “no ifs, no buts” promise not to build a third runway at Heathrow, made in 2009.\nA senior Tory said: “Cameron sees it as a trust issue and people like [the political strategist] Lynton Crosby have told him not to break his promises.”\nTreasury officials signalled that George Osborne, who has previously been seen as a cheerleader for Heathrow expansion, would be prepared to support Gatwick.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.07am BST 08:07\nSo, at last we know what Sir Howard Davies’s Airports Commission is saying about where Britain’s new runway should go. Here’s the commission’s press notice , and here’s the Guardian’s story. Here’s how it starts.\nA third runway should be built at Heathrow, the Airports Commission has recommended, but only if it can meet stringent conditions on noise and air pollution.\nThose conditions should include a ban on night flights, legally binding caps on noise and air quality – and legislation to rule out ever building a fourth runway.\nThe commission said on Wednesday morning that it was “clear and unanimous” Heathrow’s plan was the strongest case for future airport capacity, delivering the greatest strategic and economic benefits, and the conditions would make the airport a “better neighbour” than today.\nThe £17bn expansion plan would mean 250,000 more flights a year, providing a £150bn boost to GDP over 60 years and 70,000 new jobs – but would mean demolishing 783 homes including most of the neighbouring village of Harmondsworth.\nThe long-awaited verdict comes five years after the government cancelled plans for a new runway at Britain’s biggest airport and is expected to spark a renewed political battle.\nSir Howard Davies, the commission chair, said the government would need to review the analysis carefully before making a decision. But he warned it to “move as quickly as it can” or be seen as unwilling to “take the steps needed to maintain [Britain’s] position as a well-connected open trading economy”.\nBut there are two things we don’t know:\nWhat’s the government going to do?\nand\nWhat will get through parliament?\nThe two questions are, of course, related.\nI will be covering the reaction today, in the hope of getting some clues as to the answers to these questions. We’ve also got PMQS at 12pm, and a Commons statement from Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, on the Davies report at 12.30pm.\nAs usual I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.\nIf you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google
