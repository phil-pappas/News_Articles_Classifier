Terming RJD as\"Rozana Jungleraj Ka Darr\", he asserted that his party would not allow the return of\"jungle raj\" in Bihar again.\n\"This election is to get rid of RJD. Like the Lok Sabha polls, give us a two-third majority in the upcoming state assembly polls for development of Bihar. I promise you that I will fulfil the dreams of people in next 60 months if BJP is voted to power in Bihar,\" Modi said.\nHe also promised to provide round-the-clock electricity to the people.\nModi also said that the upcoming Bihar polls were not just to form the next government but to\"change the fortune of youths by providing them jobs\" and the fate of farmers and women by providing them safety and security.\nHe assured a special package of more than Rs 50,000 crore to Bihar for its development.\nThe rally was attended by all top BJP leaders from Bihar including half a dozen union ministers and heads of allies - Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party chief Upender Kushwaha. BJP's new ally, former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, also attended and shared the stage with Modi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T04:21:17.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
