Herein below are some of such tips to help you through your flight search. \n\nStart your search as early possible \n\nAlmost all airlines release tickets around eleven months in advance. So you can start researching from the very day you decide about your next trip and continue to check them at least once every week. There are possibilities of fluctuations in air fare, so be ready to act as soon as your desired price is available. Waiting for the best deal may reward you sometimes, but can also be costly and frustrating. \n\nChoose the best time to book your air-ticket \n\nWhile booking air tickets you must consider to choose the correct time. As the peak seasons, holidays or weekends are expected to have much higher priced flights than the other days of the year. Try and avoid booking within fifteen days of flying or long in advance which is more than around five months. You may also opt for price guidance from a good airfare prediction tool found on the internet to get the best airfare deals. \n\nBe flexible with the travel dates \n\nTry to be flexible with your travel dates to save more money on flights. You must search a few days or weeks on both sides of your desired travel date to know about the top deals available. This is important because getting locked with an exact date can bring more challenges in finding a better deal. \n\nBuy round-trip tickets \n\nRound trip tickets actually cost less, whereas single way cost a bomb sometimes. So even if you are travelling one way you can purchase a round trip ticket in a much cheaper rate and later you can just forfeit the return leg portion. It may sound crazy, but it really works. \n\nSearch for alternate airports \n\nSometimes checking for different airports near you or the place around your planned destination is more likely to fetch a number of options to choose from, among which, if you are lucky you can even find the last discounted seat in the flight bound to your destination. \n\n\nTravel agents are one of the most useful resource for booking flights. At times, the lowest airfares are only available through travel agents. They can easily beat the best airfare to London available online and some of them even guarantees to beat any comparable quotes in the market. \n\nSign up for email notifications \n\nSubscribing to some of the best airline newsletters can help you keep yourself aware about some of the best airline deals that are generally not announced or promoted. Email subscribers get several periodic discount and last minute deals which can save them a lot of money.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nMartin Luther has performed a series of interview with many online travel agencies around the world.
