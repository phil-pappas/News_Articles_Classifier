It is a place where history meets legend in an almost surreal way. \nThe world is fascinated by the creation of these statues not only for the impressive size and quantity of them, but also for the circumstances under which they were built. This small island had very limited resources - not much drinking water, no cattle, and no metal. And the statues were transported to their final location several kilometers across hilly terrain - all of this accomplished under the leadership of a tribal chieftain. \nThe people of Rapa Nui people number at a mere 3,000, and they love to celebrate their culture through music, dance, and art. Today, Easter Island is a part of Chile, so there are strong South American influences on this Polynesian island. \nSince the 1990s, tourism has become a more common part of the Easter Island society, with people traveling from all over the world to experience this unique culture and see the monolithic moai sculptures. \nOne travel company has, over the course of the latest year, has started offering a wider array of tours in response to demand, and it has received special attention for its focus on adventure tours, in which travelers go horseback riding for days, and camp in the wilderness under the stars and in caves. Easter Island Travel 's many happy customers have spread the word about its services, which has helped it grow greatly, and their votes ranked this domain as the #1 Easter Island tour agency on TripAdvisor. \nAs part of Easter Island Travelâ€™s growth and preparation for the future, the company also changed its website URL to a .travel domain for a cleaner slicker impression and to readily identify itself as a reputable travel website, as .travel domains are only available exclusively to verified travel and tourism businesses and organizations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:48:00.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
