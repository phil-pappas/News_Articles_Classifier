Initially, Hong Kong’s financial expertise and regulations would make the special administrative region an ideal hub for fundraising, according to Nicholas Kwan, director of research at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. China last year launched the $40 billion (£25.8 billion) Silk Road Fund to finance projects along the routes, and more recently initiated the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Mr Kwan said Hong Kong’s strengths in international finance and asset management can support these institutions, which have both attracted interest from emerging and developed economies. Transportation networks and infrastructure projects would get priority in the Belt and Road Initiative, he said, adding that Hong Kong had “experience in making full use of a harbour, effectively managing an airport, and operating subways” that would be “valuable to the mainland reforms”. Hong Kong could also help maintain good neighbour relations, he said, pointing out that the region is negotiating a free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and has concluded investment promotion and protection agreements with Bahrain and Myanmar. This year, Hong Kong will negotiate similar agreements with the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Hong Kong could also help maintain good neighbour relations – the region is negotiating a free trade agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations “Despite its lack of experience in negotiating with western Asia and Russia due to different languages and legal systems, Hong Kong has good co-operation with Southeast Asia and East Asia,” he said. Geographically, the special administrative region is well-situated along the Maritime Silk Road, and as the world’s fourth-busiest container port already provides comprehensive shipping services, with about 350 services a week linking more than 500 destinations worldwide. Meanwhile, Hong Kong International Airport is the busiest air-cargo hub in the world, handling 4.4 million tonnes of cargo and operating about 1,100 flights a day. A third runway is on the way and on completion will increase the airport’s handling capacity to 100 million passengers and 9 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2030. Hong Kong’s labour force was also valuable, Kwan said. “For young Hong Kong people seeking more development opportunities, the mainland is the perfect choice, as it’s developing at high speed.” However, some young people were hesitant. According to a recent survey by the Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre, almost 65 per cent of respondents said they were unwilling to seek jobs on the mainland, with only 4.9 per cent saying they had headed north in search of a job. Kwan admitted the different political, legal and cultural systems have deterred some people from taking advantage of the opportunities arising from rapid reforms on the mainland.
