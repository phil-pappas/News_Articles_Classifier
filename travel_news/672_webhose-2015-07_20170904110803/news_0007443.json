After moving to the countryside, Jane Gordon has had to adjust to being 'the only single woman in the village'. Will a trip away with other senior singles be just what she needs? Jane Gordon Photo: Andrew Crowley By Jane Gordon Comments \nAt Gatwick Airport, a little over a week ago, I suffered my first ever panic attack. Normally I am not a nervous traveller. But somewhere between checking in for a weeks holiday to Kos and emerging from Duty Free window shopping, I was overcome with a sense of terrible foreboding. \nThis sense of unease wasn’t sparked by the Greek financial crisis that had - a day earlier - prompted the Foreign Office to issue warnings all travellers to pack 'all medications’ and to take as many Euros as travellers could fit into their hand luggage. What frightened me was the fact that I was flying solo – setting off on a 'senior singles’ holiday - the fastest expanding market in the UK travel industry . \nSuddenly the thought of a trip on a Solo’s over 45’s week with a group of disparate, and just possibly debauched, singles seemed like the most daunting journey I had ever undertaken. What had I been thinking? \nI had no previous single experience – I married my first boyfriend and lived for then years with my second. Having lived alone for the last year, this was the first time that I had been technically single in my life. \nAdjusting to moving to the country, living alone and being 'the only single woman in the village’, however, has been surprisingly easy – I have a busy life, lots of friends and one of my three grown up children – with partners or friends – often turn up at weekends. But there are still many things that I could never do on my own – go to the cinema, sit at a table for one in a restaurant and – the real biggie - go on holiday. \n\"The latest statistics show that older adults are now engaging in much more risky sexual activity across their lifespan than previously thought\" \nLast summer I was flattered to be asked to join my elder daughter on a villa holiday she had organised with a group of her friends (all married with young children) and fabulous though that break was it was my daughter’s family holiday, not mine, and I felt intrusive and rather pitiful as if I were a burdensome maiden-aunt. \nAs fearsome as the prospect of a 'Senior Singles’ holiday might be at least I would not be the odd one out. Everyone would be odd. Baby boomer single holidays and dating sites are experiencing something of an explosion right now, linked to the dramatic increase in the divorce rate in couples in their fifties. \nHowever, while all I wanted was a week of sun, sand and Soduku (my secret senior pleasure not sex) I couldn’t ignore another startling statistic - the parallel rise in the number of older adults suffering from sexually transmitted diseases. \nWhile the reason for the high prevalence of STD’s in the over 50’s hasn’t been fully examined, the latest statistics show that older adults are now engaging in much more risky sexual activity across their lifespan than previously thought. My main worry was that my holiday might turn out to be 50 plus shades of grey. \nIt was a thought that I tried to put out of my mind during the brisk mile long walk to gate 34 until I was overtaken by four of those airport vehicles that transport PRMs (People of Restricted Mobility) directly to their departure gate. New worries crowded my head. Would I be the only Senior Solo who hadn’t had a hip-replacement , didn’t own a zimmer frame and hadn’t packed incontinence pants? I might just be the Solo Solo who could boast that they still had all their own teeth. Had I signed up for a kind of Club 80-Eternity? \n\"Chris - our silver haired (and tongued) Senior Solo rep took one look at us and muttered 'Ah, the Virgin Crew have arrived’\" \nAt gate 34 I sat down on a row of seats already occupied by two elegant, attractive middle aged women - one blonde and one brunette - who looked as anxious as me. Janetta (the blonde) and Glenda (the brunette) were, it turned out, the only other Senior Solo’s on the flight and united by our mutual fear of the unknown we became an instant band of three. \nAn hour later, clinging together like schoolgirls going to their first boy-girl party we made quite an entrance into the crowded bar where we were due to meet the rest of our group. Chris - our silver haired (and tongued) Senior Solo rep took one look at us and muttered 'Ah, the Virgin Crew have arrived’. A nickname we endured for the whole week. \nDinner that first night was awkward. Chris made valiant attempts to 'break the ice’ with jokes; 'last night I almost had a threesome, I only needed two more people’ he chortled, but uniting twenty five strangers seated round a vast table in a self-service hotel restaurant is nothing but tricky. Particularly when a few of the older people were hard of hearing and one or two of the men in the group seemed to have limited social skills. Men of few - and in one case NO - words who seem baffled by everything but the food. \nThe gender ratio of the group (the average on Solos holidays) was 60% female to 40% men and -apart from Chris - it was the women who breathed some life into the group. Patsy, a 73 year old former wine merchant, managed to hold our attention with a saucy tale of how she and her late-husband got locked in after they went for late night skinny dip and 'bit of slap and tickle’ in the indoor pool at their hotel. But it was Camilla, who made the breakthrough that first night. Telling us about a widowed woman in her sixties she had befriended on a previous trip that had, unusually, been packed with handsome Senior Single men. \n\"It quickly became obvious that for most of the Senior Solos sex was nothing more than a talking point\" \nOne evening Camilla asked her friend if she would consider having a relationship with one of them. ’Oh no dear’ the woman replied 'not without an oxygen mask and a manual’. This became the catch phrase of the week - at the end of every night when each Senior Solo went to bed, Chris would shout 'Don’t forget your manual’. \nIt quickly became obvious that for most of the Senior Solos sex was nothing more than a talking point . There were lots innuendos, but very little action. Two of the younger women - divorcees about to hit 50 admitted to flings with 'more than one but less than five’ of the more good looking young Greek staff. Another woman in her sixties had fallen in love with the ridiculously handsome waiter Chris called 'Gorgeous Giorgos’ and had booked a return trip to see him in August. \nBut the majority of our group were veterans of many Senior Solos trips and the last thing they were looking for in Kos was love. What made so many of the guests come back year after year was the way in which a Solo rep as good as Chris made this mismatched, motley group of men and women feel like a family. \nHis bawdy banter came thick and fast, jokes about everything from Viagra helping with sunburn to teasing one guest Rose - a reclusive woman who sat by the pool everyday wearing a navy blue pleated dress, a cardigan, sixty denier stockings and stout lace-up leather shoes. \nAfter six days of saying 'Rose I dream of seeing you take off your cardigan’ she stood up in front of Chris, wriggled out of her cardigan, in bold stripper style prompting a burst of applause. But, for me, his greatest achievement of the week was taking the stigma out of going on a 'singles’ holiday in the first place. \nThere was no pressure to do anything other than what you wanted – the only obligation was to be on the veranda at 7 for a drink before we took our table in the restaurant. A table that was not just the largest but also the loudest – our raucous laughter echoed round the room in such a joyous way that it was hard not to feel sorry for the quiet couples watching us from their tables for two. I didn’t, thank heavens, come back with a fiancé or a toy boy but I did come home with a tan and two fabulous friends who have already persuaded me to join them on a holiday to Italy next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:53:10.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
