Moovit, which aims to give people the best public transport routes to a destination, launched just under a year ago in Britain. The app collates train and bus timetables alongside other public data, as well as crowdsourcing information from its users, to provide directions. Entering a destination provides a choice of routes, with information on how long the journey is expected to take. It can then adjust its recommendations based on live events, such as last week's 24-hour Tube strike, or to respond to changes in less-consistent public transport networks in developing countries. Moovit's vice president of global product and marketing Alex Torres, who left a position at Google Maps to join the business, said the service now had 20 million users across the world. Since its launch in Tel Aviv in 2013 it has rapidly expanded into 55 countries and 600 cities. Users can leave feedback on routes, which are used by the app to adjust recommendations The company raised $50m (£32m) at the beginning of the year from investors including Sequoia Capital, a leading Silicon Valley investor, and the venture capital arms of Nokia and BMW. It has reportedly been valued at up to £300m despite having no revenues. In the future though, the app could begin to take fees from selling tickets or arranging taxi journeys, Mr Torres said. Moovit is one of a number of businesses looking to combine a smartphone's location technology with public data to improve transport. London-founded app CityMapper has a dedicated community and has launched in 27 cities, although Mr Torres said the two were not competing, with Moovit offering a less-detailed service, albeit in more locations. CityMapper is available in the UK only to residents of London, Manchester and Birmingham, for example, while Moovit's greater reach means it is also popular in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds and Sheffield. Google's own mapping service also offers public transport directions. Brazil is the biggest market for Moovit, which is also popular in Columbia and Chile. In areas where public transport data can be erratic or difficult to find, data entered from users is often used to plug gaps, allowing users to build up a map of routes even without a formal timetable.
