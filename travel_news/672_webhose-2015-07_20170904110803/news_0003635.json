While changes in bookings for Australia have not surfaced for Simon Er, general manager of business events, DMC & tours, Global Travel, he believes that “the demand for Australia will increase over the next few months as the destination becomes more affordable and the value obtained is greater”. \nEr noted that most corporate clients plan their trips six to 12 months in advance. \nFor business events that have already been confirmed in Australia, the stronger buying power has led to some clients adding extra activities to “offer more value to (delegates)”, said Teo. \nChan Brothers Travel’s spokesperson, Rebecca Chia, whose company has upcoming corporate programmes in Perth, remarked that dining and entertainment expenditure “at the destination may increase due to the attractive exchange rates”. \nNone of the event specialists expect extensions to length of stay and upgrades on hotels options and venues, as arrangements and bookings have already been made. \nHowever Er said clients might offer their delegates turndown gifts or a local souvenir in view of “cost savings from the exchange rate”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:50:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
