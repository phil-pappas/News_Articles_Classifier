Sarah said: 'We had a great trip in France but the day of the crash has to be one of the worst of my life.\n'Thankfully, we all made it out of the crash alive, but myself and my husband suffered serious injuries while our children all suffered minor injuries. As well as the physical impact, we have all been left traumatised by our ordeal.\n'We all simply want to know what happened and what can be done to ensure it doesn't happen again. The last few months have been the most difficult time of my life and I would not want anyone to have to face what I've been through. It has been absolute hell.'\nSarah Rothwell-Bowness, her husband, and the couple's friends, Katie and Gary Hannah, were all travelling together on a ski holiday\nThe coach (right), which crashed at about 8:30am, was organised by tour operator Esprit Holidays\nKatie added: 'The crash has left our entire family absolutely traumatised and I am still trying to come to terms with the awful injuries I received.\n'The scarring is horrific and is something I will have to live with for the rest of my life. We are thankful the children weren't more seriously injured, or worse.'\nThe coach, carrying 32 British passengers in total, overturned after leaving the road.\nThe vehicle was described by witnesses as swerving out of control, leaving the road, and then coming to rest by guard rails at the edge of a ravine.\nFrench police, however, are still investigating the cause of the collision.\nSarah (pictured), her husband and another couple are taking legal action against Esprit Holidays\nKatie and Gary, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, were travelling with their three children at the time of the incident.\nKatie, a sales director, suffered severe cuts in the crash and will shortly undergo surgery to remove a piece of glass that remains in her right arm.\nHer husband suffered nerve damage in his shoulder and continues to struggle with movement in his right arm.\nThe passengers have instructed specialist lawyers at Irwin Mitchell's travel law team to pursue a claim for compensation, to investigate the cause of the accident and to find out if more could have been done to prevent the crash.\nIrwin Mitchell will also be seeking to help their clients with their recovery and the rehabilitation they need following their injuries.\nIn a statement issued to MailOnline Travel, Esprit CEO, Andy Perrin said: 'We deeply regret that our guests were involved in this incident, and have done all we can to support the families concerned both at the time, on their return to the UK, and subsequently.\n'A full investigation has been completed by the French police, whose report is available to the families' advisors.\n'We hope all will appreciate that we cannot go into further detail however, whilst this matter remains ongoing.'\nFrench police are still investigating the cause of the collision, which left passengers badly bruised\nSarah's friend, Katie Hannah, suffered similarly severe cuts in her right arm and will undergo surgery soon\nAs well as Katie's shocking injuries, her husband suffered nerve damage in his shoulder and continues to struggle with movement in his right arm\nPhilip Banks, a partner at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The passengers involved in this incident suffered a terrible ordeal on board the coach and continue to suffer the consequences.\n'They should be remembering their holiday together with fondness, but instead it will be memorable for all the wrong reasons and, understandably, they want answers about what caused the crash.\n'Our clients want to know what happened to cause the coach to leave the road. They could have been killed and want reassurances that lessons will be learned to improve coach safety in future.\n'We are also working to ensure our clients gain access to the support, medical treatment and rehabilitation they need to help them recover both physically and mentally from this ordeal so that they can get their lives back on track.\n'We have repeatedly called for safety improvements and better regulation around maintenance of coaches and measures to ensure drivers are carefully monitored and they are trained to the highest possible standard.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1HyMSay"], "published": "2015-07-17T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:30:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
