The scenery is great, and there’s a dedicated bike path, so you don’t have to worry about traffic,” says Adam McDermott , founder of Linus Bike , which makes vintage-style European city cycles. “It’s the best thing to do with your family.” He shares some favorite pathways with Larry Bleiberg for USA TODAY.\nMarvin Braude Bike Trail\nLos Angeles\nA Southern California favorite, this 22-mile path, also known as The Strand, connects Will Rogers State Beach with Torrance Beach, passing through iconic sites like Santa Monica and Venice Beach. “The scenery changes dramatically as you bike down the coast. These are prime tourist destinations,” McDermott says. He and his staff are regulars on the trail, located just a few blocks from the Linus headquarters. beaches.lacounty.gov\nUSA TODAY\n10Best: Bike-share programs to tour great cities\nGitchi-Gami State Trail\nTwo Harbors, Minn.\nThe best way to experience the grandeur of Lake Superior is to pedal its shoreline. Cyclists also have the opportunity to see animal and bird life as the trail passes through forest. The path currently stretches more than 29 miles in multiple segments, the longest almost 15 miles. When complete, the 88-mile paved path will connect Two Harbors with Grand Marais, Minn. ggta.org\nEast Bay Bike Path\nProvidence, R.I.\nOver its 13.8-mile length, this path connects eight parks on its route from Providence to Bristol. Built on an abandoned rail line, it offers cyclists views of the tidal Providence River. “The path allows people to easily escape the city and enjoy the sights, sounds and smells as they pass through coves and marshes,” McDermott says. 401-253-7482; riparks.com/Locations/LocationEastBay.html\nTony Knowles Coastal Trail\nAnchorage\nDon’t expect to be cycling this 11-mile trail alone. While the trail begins in downtown Anchorage, it quickly heads into forest. Depending on the time of day or year, you may encounter moose, wolves and eagles, along with beluga whales cavorting offshore in Knik Arm, which connects to the Gulf of Alaska. anchoragecoastaltrail.com\nIsland Line Trail\nBurlington, Vt.\nOne of New England’s top trails offers views of the Adirondack Mountains and massive Lake Champlain. The 14-mile converted rail line connects several shoreline parks, and at one point cyclists are surrounded by water when they cross an elevated causeway 20 feet above the lake’s surface. The path even has a bike ferry, bridging a 200-foot gap in the causeway. 802-861-2700; localmotion.org\nRuth Bascom Trail\nEugene, Ore.\nWith easy access to parks, the University of Oregon and several of the city’s famed breweries, this 12-mile paved path along the Willamette River offers practically anything a cyclist might want. The route, part of a larger city riverbank trail system, runs on both sides of the river, with four crossings. 800-547-5445; eugenecascadescoast.org/cycling/\nThe Embarcadero and Golden Gate Bridge\nSan Francisco\nThe San Francisco area is laced with bike routes, but this one is a show-stopper offering views of the Bay and a chance to ride across the Golden Gate. The nearly 8-mile route follows the shoreline along the Embarcadero, connects to SF Bike Route 2 and then crosses the Golden Gate Bridge. “If it’s a sunny day in San Francisco, everyone is out,” McDermott says. SanFrancisco.travel\nLakefront Trail\nChicago\nChicago’s skyline, parks and neighborhoods are all on full display to cyclists along this 18-mile lake-front path. The route between busy Lake Shore Drive and the grassy parks that front much of the lake offers easy access to sites like the Lincoln Park Zoo, Millennium Park, the Loop and Hyde Park. choosechicago.com\nFlorida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail\nCyclists can already pedal 76 miles along this trail following the famed Overseas Highway. And eventually a 106-mile path will link Key Largo to Key West, crossing dozens of bridges along the way. McDermott says many riders enjoy cycling the section by John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. 305-853-3571; floridastateparks.org/trail/Florida-Keys\nManhattan Waterfront Greenway\nNew York\nCyclists can cover all of Manhattan on this 32-mile route that circumnavigates the entire island, connecting the East, Harlem and Hudson River greenways. Much of the path is separated from traffic, and some parts even separate bikes from pedestrians. Highlights include the George Washington Bridge, the Palisades and the Brooklyn Bridge. “This one is an amazing ride because it’s a protected bike lane. You kind of have a mini bike highway,” McDermott says. nycgo.com\n2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1SnsuRU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
