It would then be more and more difficult as time went by to explain why people should invest in London,” Davies said. \nIt came as he delivered his long-awaited report last week, which recommended a new runway at Heathrow over rival Gatwick. \nTransport secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said he will update parliament in the autumn on the government’s plans - a message reiterated by chancellor George Osborne to the conference. \nHowever, former Labour transport secretary Lord Andrew Adonis said he was yet to be convinced that the current government was any more serious about airport infrastructure than previous ones. \nSpeaking at the conference he said there was no definitive “green light” for Heathrow; rather, it was more of a “flashing amber light at the moment”, with a lot hingeing on the involvement of David Cameron. \nAdonis also highlighted the divisions within the Conservative party, with current mayor of London Boris Johnson and potential challenger Zac Goldsmith avowedly anti-Heathrow. “The early omens are not encouraging,” he added. \n“The Conservative party is very strongly divided on this issue. It’s not going to be easy for a Conservative government to take a firm and decisive lead in the direction of Heathrow before the mayoral election.” \nMeanwhile, the commission’s report left the door slightly open for Gatwick, claiming that the West Sussex airport was “feasible”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:02:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
