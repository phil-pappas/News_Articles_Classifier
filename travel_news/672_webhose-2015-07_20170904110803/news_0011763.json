Footwear is, of course, crucial. You aren’t going to enjoy your walk - or get very far - if your feet are wet and uncomfortable. Start with your footwear. A good pair of walking boots is essential, as it will offer ankle support while walking. It is worth going to a specialist outdoor retailer - such as Blacks or Kathmandu - to ensure the style you choose is suited to your foot shape and the terrain you’ll be walking on. It’s also worth getting proper walking socks too. These allow your feet to “breathe” properly - helping to prevent blisters. The next piece of vital kit is a map, to ensure you don’t get lost. The OS Explorer series - on a scale of 1:25,000 - is ideal for walkers. There are now hi-tech options too. GPS devices are popular with keen walkers. These are a whole range of different models to suit various budgets. Most should have a far longer battery life than a typical smartphone - useful for those longer hikes. An IPX rating of 3 or 4 is just splash-proof; 5 or 6 is “water-resistant”, so shouldn’t be damaged in heavy rain; whereas a rating of 7 or more is completely waterproof, and should survive submersion in a puddle It helps to have a sturdy rucksack for carrying your stuff. For longer walks, a rucksack with chest/hip straps is more stable, and better for your shoulders and back. And make sure it has a waterproof lining (you don’t want soggy maps or sandwiches). And while you are thinking about the weather, waterproof jackets, trousers and dry bags for electrical equipment are ideal. Most equipment should come with its own IPX rating, showing how waterproof it is: an IPX rating of 3 or 4 is just splash-proof; 5 or 6 is “water-resistant”, so shouldn’t be damaged in heavy rain; whereas a rating of 7 or more is completely waterproof, and should survive submersion in a puddle or stream. You need to protect yourself against the sun, as well as the rain. Sunscreen and a hat are essential in summer months. Those walking in colder conditions should ensure they have suitable warm clothing. Several thin base layers are much more effective than one thick jumper. Finally, make sure you have adequate water with you. Walking experts suggest each person should have half a litre for every five miles - and more on hot days. You also need snacks and, for emergencies, a small first-aid kit and change for a public telephone. If you are walking in more rural areas, you may not be able to get a phone signal. • To find out more about the Ordnance Survey’s OS Maps service, visit os.co.uk/osmaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:46:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
