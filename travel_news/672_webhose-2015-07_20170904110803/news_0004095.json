That journey will end by early next week in the Sea of Japan, but not before Halola impacts Japan and southeastern South Korea this weekend. \nHalola could become the first tropical cyclone to originate in the central Pacific Ocean and track through the Ryukyu Islands since Super Typhoon Oliwa in September 1997. Oliwa did so with its strength equal to that of a Category 1 hurricane, then continued on to make landfall in mainland Japan. \nHalola will be a minimal typhoon or will be weakening to a tropical storm when it passes through the Ryukyu Islands to start this weekend. Halola prolonging its westward track before taking a turn to the north has shifted the danger of a direct landfall from Shikoku and Honshu to the Ryukyu Islands. \nDeteriorating conditions start Friday night as the system tracks in between or over the islands of Amami and Okinawa on Saturday, local time. \nDamaging wind gusts of around 130 kph (80 mph) will howl near the center of Halola, while 100 to 200 mm (4 to 8 inches) of rain severely heightens the concern for flash flooding. The heaviest rain will actually be displaced to the south of Halola's center, targeting Okinawa. \nDangerous surf will build throughout the Ryukyu Islands leading up to this weekend. The threat of an inundating storm surge also exists, especially near and northeast of the typhoon's center. \nAfter lashing the Ryukyu Islands, Halola will turn to the north and track toward the Sea of Japan. The good news is that disruptive winds aloft, known as wind shear, and cooler waters will force Halola to weaken dramatically before reaching South Korea. \nOverview of the Weather Across Asia \nHalola will be a minimal tropical storm when it tracks into southeastern South Korea to end the weekend, reducing the dangers of damaging winds and flooding rain to a localized level. \nWind gusts in southeastern South Korea will average 65 to 95 kph (40 to 60 mph) with the strongest winds at the coast. Similar winds will graze the far western islands and northwestern coast of Japan's Kyushu Island. These winds will be capable of causing tree damage and sporadic power outages. \nA total of 50 to 100 mm (2 to 4 inches) of rain will accompany Halola into southeastern South Korea. \nThe eastern East China Sea will also become very rough and dangerous for those with boating interests. Coastal flooding may occur east of where Halola tracks. \n\"The impacts [from Halola later this weekend] will equate to a strong non-tropical system,\" stated AccuWeather Meteorologist Rob Richards. \nHalola is expected to weaken further and lose its tropical characteristics by early next week in the Sea of Japan. It may then combine with another system to spread downpours into northern Honshu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:25:29.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
