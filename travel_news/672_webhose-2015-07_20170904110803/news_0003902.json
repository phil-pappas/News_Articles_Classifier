The video shows one of the passengers playing club classic Look Right Through by Storm Queen on their phone while others belt out the chorus and dance in their seats. Their behaviour forced the cabin crew to intervene, in a desperate attempt to take control of the situation. \"Ladies and gentlemen, please remain quiet. There are travellers on board with young children. Please do not swear. Thank you,\" a flight attendant says over the plane's public announcement system. \nThings got a little rowdy on an Ibiza-bound flight, forcing cabin crew to order passengers to 'stop swearing' as there were children on board. \nThe Glasgow-Ibiza service is notorious for party-passenger problems. \nAccording to the Daily Record , Ryanair has banned booze on Scotland-Ibiza flight: \"Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be searched at boarding gates.\" \nThe video of the raucous passengers was posted to Facebook and currently has over 4000 likes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:29:27.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
