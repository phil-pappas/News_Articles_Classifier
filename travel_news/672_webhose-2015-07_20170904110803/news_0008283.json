This has caused cases where the airplane could not fly faster due to the high-speed limit or much slower due to the low-speed limit, making it difficult to control during turbulence or when descending.\nOne extreme example of the coffin corner is the U-2 – the difference between the famed spy plane’s high-speed limit vs. low-speed limits is quite narrow at the extreme altitudes of 60,000 feet or more. It is a very challenging airplane to fly because of the small acceptable airspeed window.\nMost modern jetliners have good speed margins, making coffin corner problems an issue of the past.\nQ: Jet aircraft have evolved greatly over the last 30 years, yet the cruising altitudes have remained fairly constant. Is there an explanation for this?\n-- Dave Thomson, Niagara Falls, Canada\nA: Subsonic jets are most efficient around 40,000 feet. Jet engines are much more efficient than they used to be, but the altitudes have remained relatively constant due to the cost of flying higher and the limited benefit.\nQ: When approaching stall speed in a commercial airliner, can a pilot without engine power maintain level flight, thereby avoiding a wing from dipping down and increasing the chance of a sudden crash?\n-- Philip, St. Augustine, Fla.\nA: Stalls are not related to engine power. A stall occurs when the air flowing over the wing is no longer attached to the wing and producing lift. When a stall occurs, many airplanes will experience a wing dropping because it stalls slightly ahead of the other one. Pilots can regain wing level by using the roll flight controls (ailerons and flight spoilers) and, if needed, the rudder. The critical action is to lower the nose to recover from the stall (get air flowing over the wing), resulting in the symmetrical production of lift.\nA stall does not result in a sudden crash.\nMORE: Read previous columns\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN //usat.ly/1MQrv63 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1MQrv63&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1MQrv63&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20What%20is%20the%20coffin%20corner%3F&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635733325609081190-ThinkstockPhotos-481175202.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1MQrv63", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac9a9e9919cea05edbedd45221e1e70d33ed57e1/c=0-0-1893-1423&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/07/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635733325609081190-ThinkstockPhotos-481175202.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-26T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:39:11.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
