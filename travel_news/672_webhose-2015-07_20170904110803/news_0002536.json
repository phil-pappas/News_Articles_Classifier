The Turkish Airlines Periscope flight started from a live streaming at the Crew Garden in Istanbul Ataturk Airport, where pilots and flight attendants relaxed before boarding the plane.\nThe broadcasting then moved to the aircraft itself and followed the crew’s preparation, including exterior checks. After that, the real journey began: thanks to Turkish Airlines’ onboard Wi-Fi system, live images of the crew at work while flying over the North Atlantic Airspace were broadcasted live, allowing people to take a sneak peak also in the Crew Rest Departments, an area which is usually out of bounds for normal travelers. Viewers rose to the peak when the flight went live from the US airspace and Turkish Airlines started asking viewers to guess where they were about to land. At last, this exceptional journey ended with the farewell of the crew from Times Square, in New York City.\n“At Turkish Airlines, we are always focused on creating engaging experiences for travelers through new technologies“explained Neşet Dereli, Interactive Marketing Communications Manager for Turkish Airlines “The first cockpit and cabin crew’s flight ever broadcasted live in the world was also the first Turkish Airlines branded live-stream in the sky. And we scored a resounding success: our Periscope flight achieved 292.772 total likes and allowed us to gain 5.118 new followers”.\nSource:-Turkish Airlines\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 April 1 Alert: WestJet moves to metric time Lufthansa Group increases result in core business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:00:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
