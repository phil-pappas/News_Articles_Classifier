MONMOUTH — Despite being only 8 miles west of Cameron, Monmouth escaped Thursday night's storms nearly unscathed. The swirling cloud pattern traveled east over Monmouth and continued on its path until it let loose over Cameron. \"I started chasing the storm west of Monmouth as it worked its way north of Highway 34,\" said amateur storm chaser Jeremy Simmons. \"As it got closer to Monmouth, I noticed a lot of funnel clouds. This told me that we were dealing with a superstorm.\" A superstorm is severe, widespread and characterized by record-setting meteorological events and large-scale destruction. Simmons has been a storm chaser since 1995, and he claimed the formation he witnessed Thursday night was the second largest of his career. \"This was a rotating storm. Tornadoes usually come out of a main vortex, but this was different because it had several tornadoes within it. These are very dangerous storms to chase,\" Simmons said. \"This is a very rare storm formation, at least from what I have encountered in this area. The further down south you go, the more common it gets, but for west-central Illinois, it is out of place.\" After arriving in Cameron, law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks at every entrance/exit of the village. With so many homeowners displaced, a shelter was established at the First Street Armoury. The shelter also functioned as a recovery area for Cameron's first responders. As they all worked through the night, though, volunteers chose to take water and food to Cameron instead. \"We brought the last Cameron resident in here at 2 a.m. We also matched her with her daughter. There were a couple of different times children were reunited with their parents at the shelter,\" said Jenna Link, Warren County Health Department administrator. \"Being a part of that felt great. They were teary-eyed and hugging, and you can just see that it is a huge relief for them to know the other is alright.\" Steve and Melinda Armstrong spent the night worrying about their son, Jake, who lives beside the family's business, Cameron Grain Corp. The tornado whipped through town, blowing out windows, ripping up trees and generally destroying anything in its path; the Armstrongs' business was not immune. Of the many buildings that originally stood together to comprise Cameron Grain, only two were left after the storm. \"The elevator bins were empty, so the pressure change crumpled them like aluminum foil, balling them up and putting them in a pile,\" said Melinda Armstrong. \"Most of our business had folded over onto the railroad tracks. The elevator is basically gone. Part of the office and two of the grain bins, that happened to be full of corn, are the only structures left standing.\" The only positive to come from the near annihilation of the family's business is that the various bins and grain elevators served as a sort of wind-block protecting Jake's home, which is close to the family business. Page 2 of 2 - \"At first I thought it was just a normal storm, but all of a sudden it just ramped up,\" said Jake. \"It was absolutely devastating watching those bins go down. It is hard to sit there and watch something we worked so hard to build be gone in an instant. Right now there are tons of power lines, limbs and debris littering the ground. We are allowed to leave Cameron, but we can't come back once we do.\" Armstrong said the first thing he did once he emerged from his basement and saw many of the bins spread out across the tracks was to call BNSF \"in order to avoid an even bigger catastrophe,\" he said. \"I was in shock. Looking around, I just couldn't believe I was still in Cameron. It looked nothing like the way it had hours before.\" Cameron Grain Corp. was founded in 1966. Now 50 years and a single storm later, there is nothing to show of the company but wreckage. \"It is what it is. This is life, and we are always faced with adversity,\" said Jake, who is in his early 20s. \"Eventually, we will be stronger for it once we come out on top.\" By Matthew Dutton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T15:13:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
