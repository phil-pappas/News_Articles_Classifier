Originally a luxurious solarium, it was later used as a work car before finally being left to rust at a train yard. \nHeritage Park says its staff and contractors spent two years converting it into a reimagined 1920s dining car, complete with replica wood panelling. \nOn Tuesdays until Aug. 25, lunches ($120 for two for \"a historically inspired menu\") will be served in the car while it is pulled by an antique steam engine around the park. \nTo reserve, call 403-268-8500. \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
