The Markit/CIPS UK services purchasing managers' index is likely to be the main event of the day for the City and comes on the back of mixed PMIs on the construction and manufacturing sectors earlier in the week. Analysts expect the PMI to have risen to 57.5 after falling to a five-month low of 56.5 in May. \nThe UK manufacturing PMI on Wednesday unexpectedly dropped to a 26-month low in June of 51.4, while Thursday's UK construction PMI rebounded more than anticipated to a four-month high of 58.1. \nNews flow on Greece is likely to remain quiet, given that the government has confirmed that a referendum will go ahead as planned on Sunday, and that creditors have refused to discuss a bailout deal until after the public vote. \nMeanwhile, equity markets in the States will close early for a long weekend as the country holds its Fourth of July celebrations. \nFriday 03 July INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Associated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) , Blackrock Frontiers Investment Trust, Daily Mail and General Trust A (Non.V), Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) , Grainger (LSE: GRI.L - news ) , Shaftesbury (LSE: SHB.L - news ) , SSP Group (LSE: SSPG.L - news ) , UDG Healthcare Public Limited Company QUARTERLY EX-DIVIDEND DATE JP Morgan Chase & Co INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS PMI Composite (EU) (09:00) PMI Composite (GER) (08:55) PMI Services (EU) (09:00) PMI Services (GER) (08:55) Retail Sales (EU) (10:00) FINALS Polar Capital Technology Trust SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Helios Underwriting (LSE: HUW.L - news ) , Small Companies Dividend Trust, Synthomer, Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) AGMS Circle Oil (LSE: COP.L - news ) , Distil, Industrial Mlulti Propety Trust UK ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Official Reserves (09:30) PMI Composite (09:30) PMI Services (09:30) FINAL DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE Ashley (Laura) Holding, BBGI SICAV S.A.
