ARIOĞLU   Morocco has long been known for palm tree-lined streets filled with the smell of saffron, a colorful night life and spicy cuisine. The country, also famous for the 1942 Hollywood film ‘Casablanca,' attracts tourists from around the world \nThis country boasts many sites included on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list and attracts many tourists from all around the world.

The city is mostly adored for its streets decorated with palm trees, its coast on the Atlantic Ocean and the Hassan II Mosque with a 210-meter-high minaret. Casablanca was a Berber town in the seventh century, Portuguese in the 15th century, Spanish in the 16th and 17th centuries and in 1907, the French invaded and remained under French control until 1957. All the cultures that have inhabited Casablanca have shaped the city into what it is today. It is possible to get to Casablanca from Turkey on a direct, five-hour flight. Casablanca is composed of two parts - the historical area called the Old City or Old Madina and the modern part called Ville Nouvelle. The Place de Nations Unies square, luxurious buildings and the Clock Tower, built by the French architect Henri Prost at the beginning of the 20th century, form the center of Ville Nouvelle. The center area is the Habous district. The buildings in the area contain modern features even though they were built according to traditional western Arabic architecture. With neat streets, green areas, commerce centers and shops, the district is one of the most important districts in Casablanca. The Royal Palace is also located near this district. Mohammed V Boulevard is in the north of the Habous Quartier. The most important passages of this boulevard are Passage Sumica and Passage du Galaoui, which were built in the Art Deco style. The world's highest minaret is part of the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca, built by the French architect Michel Pinseau. The minaret is 210 meters high and its mosque is located on a cape near the harbor on the Atlantic Ocean.
