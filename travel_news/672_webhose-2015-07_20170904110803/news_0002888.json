I am going there so I can spend some time with family and enjoy some authentic and delicious homemade food,” Zain said.\nZain's favourite Eid holiday was last year’s in Jordan as it was the first time she was meeting her extended family for years, which she said was a fun-filled gathering that revived heartfelt childhood memories. “Eid is also in July this year, which is a hot period in the UAE, so I am glad that I will be escaping some of the summer heat,” she added.\nYomna Abdul Rahim, 23, field engineer, also told Gulf News that home captures the true Eid spirit. “Being home feels different. It will never be the same without celebrating it with your family and friends,” she said. \nAt times when Yomna is unable to travel to Egypt, her family celebrates the holiday in Abu Dhabi instead. \n“Being with family during Eid is one of our culture’s key traditions,” she added. \nWhile some residents choose to travel back to their countries during Eid, others find it more convenient to spend the holiday with their loved ones here. \nAs the majority of her family members and friends are based in the country, Dima Salame, 23, senior account executive, continues to spend Eid here in the UAE every year, a place she calls home. \nParticularly looking forward to this one, Dima said, “Last year was exceptional as it was a full house. However, my fiance is now a part of our family, whom we will be celebrating Eid with for the first time.” \nNoushad Aziz, Manager at Land of Holidays Travel Agency, said that the upcoming Eid holidays have seen an “expatriate rush and it will be busy over the Eid holidays, with many families travelling home to be with friends and family”. \n“This year again Eid coincides with the summer holidays, so people travelling combine the two together. Many people sent their families home before Eid, with the children travelling once schools closed, so they will now join the rest of the family during this period.” \nBilal Khalil, Sales Manager at Leading Hotels of the World, said that Europe was also proving to be a popular destination. “You have what I call the comfort zones, London, Paris, Geneva, and Munich. These destinations have always been popular and continue to be so during this holiday period.” \n“I would also say that people are becoming more adventurous and open to trying new and different places now as well. We are getting bookings to places like Santorini, Marbella, and Tenerife. A few years ago you wouldn’t really hear much about people from this area travelling to Tenerife,” he added. \nKhalil also mentioned that while people were still travelling to other Middle Eastern destinations such as Egypt and Jordan, the “numbers are not as high due to some of the political turmoil in the region”. \nMaisoon Mubarak and Heidi Pullyard are trainees at Gulf News \nBy Sami Zaatari Staff Reporter Maisoon Mubarak And Heidi Pullyard Special to Gulf News \nGulf News 2015.
