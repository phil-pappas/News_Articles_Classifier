Here are 10 of the best: 10 Mediterranean islands you've never heard of (CNN) - \nSometimes it feels like the best Mediterranean islands must've started taking this year's summer bookings back in the 1970s. Related Content 10 best romantic getaways \nAll the best spots are long gone, leaving just overpriced or underwhelming options for last-minute travelers. \nThere are, however, still a few Med destinations that are still so far under the radar that even at the height of the season there's a fair chance no one else will have found them. \nThese tiny, quiet and remote islands resemble the Med before its popularity went off the charts. \nHere are 10 of the best: \nIles Sanguinaires (France) \nTheir name translates as the Bloody Islands, but while Iles Sanguinaires may have had a gruesome past, these days it refers to more relaxing qualities. \nThe uninhabited four islets off the western coast of the French island of Corsica are famous for their \"flamboyant\" purple sunsets. \nThe sea and sky appear to bleed, setting ablaze the reddish volcanic rocks and creating Corsica's best evening displays, according to locals. \nThey're a diving and nsnorkeling hotspot, not least because hundreds of ships crashed there. \nAdding to the spooky appearance are ruins of a former quarantine station for coral fishermen with \"sangrunero\" (black blood) -- otherwise known as The Plague. \nMezzu Mare, the largest isle, has a lighthouse built on the remains of a Genoese look-out tower. \nGetting there: Shuttle boats leave from the Corsican port of Ajaccio. \nStaying there: Stella di Mare on the Corsican mainland enjoys a superb view of the archipelago. \nLinosa (Italy) \nReaching Linosa from Rome is a 24-hour journey -- but it's worth it. \nThis volcanic atoll is closer to the coast of Tunisia than it is to the Italian island of Sicily. \nLanding here is like touching down on another planet -- Mars. \nThe jet-black beach of La Pozzolana has sulfur-yellow and red layers. Its Black Planet bar is popular for sunset aperitifs and private dinners. \nSnorkelers dipping their mask into the water are greeted by black crystal-clear scenery. \nThe island is home to loggerhead turtles and there's a hospital dedicated to helping heal those hurt on fishermen's hooks. \nAt night, under starry skies, the turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. \nA hike into the island's center reveals Monte Vulcano, an extinct volcano covered in fluorescent green prickly pears. \nThe island's main village is a bunch of low-rise pink and green dwellings. \nGetting there: Flights connect Rome and Milan to Lampedusa island, which is linked to Linosa by ferry. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:03:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
