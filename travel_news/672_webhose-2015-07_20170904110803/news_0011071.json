They will also assign 57 tow trucks to remove confiscated and broken-down cars from the roads.\nOfficers during last year’s vacations issued a total of 6,535 traffic fines, most of them to drivers caught speeding, driving under the influence, using a phone while driving or not wearing a seat belt. A total of 435 motorists were caught driving without a permit and 82 were charged with driving under the influence, according to Traffic Police records.\nLast year 14 people died in road accidents during the two-week holiday period. “Five of them were motorcyclists, four were passengers in a car, three were pedestrians, one was a driver and another was a cyclist,” Calderón explained.\nPolice surveillance operations\nStarting Saturday, the Public Security Ministry will also set up checkpoints along many national roads. National Police officers will conduct inspections on buses and provide safety information to tourists in the most visited locations of the coastal provinces of Guanacaste, Limón and Puntarenas.\nNational Police, Tourist Police, and Air Surveillance Service officers will all contribute to the surveillance operations.\nTourist Police Director Luis Chavarría recommends that vacationers exercise extreme caution, remain vigilant of their belongings and specifically avoid leaving valuables or cash inside their vehicles.\n“Theft is the most common crime against tourists in this period and it mostly occurs because they leave valuable items in plain view, usually inside their cars,” Chavarría said.\nHe also recommends keeping a close watch on children and seeking information about ocean currents when visiting the beach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:07:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
