Bush in 2002. Now female senators are joining a chorus of voices for him to give it back, in light of several sex allegations against the actor. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York democrat has lent her backing to a petition on the White House website entitled: ‘Revoke the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby.’ She joined Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri in backing the campaign. The petition , which was started by a charity called PAVE ( Promoting Awareness / Victim Empowerment) which aims to \"shatter the silence around sexual violence\", says Crosby “does not deserve to be on the list of [the medal’s] distinguished recipients”. Here is the full text of the petition: “The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest award bestowed on civilians for their contributions to society. Bill Cosby does not deserve to be on the list of distinguished recipients. “PAVE: Promoting Awareness | Victim Empowerment, a national nonprofit dedicated to sexual assault prevention and victim empowerment, is rallying supporters to remedy this injustice. “Cosby admitted to procuring drugs to have sex with women without their consent. He has been accused of serial rape by dozens of others. “We cannot yet give his accusers their day in court, but we can fight back in the court of public opinion. “We urge the administration to take the unprecedented action of revoking this award. “For more information, go to www.ShatteringtheSilence.org .” Nearly seven thousand people have signed the petition, which needs a further 93,000 backers to reach its 100,000 goal - which would force an official response from the White House. Last week court documents emerged revealing Cosby admitted giving prescription sedatives to women he was pursuing for sex. Women who have made sex allegations against Bill Cosby said they felt vindicated by an admission the comedian made in secret court evidence that he had given sedatives to a 19-year-old before intercourse. Speaking under oath during a civil case in 2005 Cosby, 77, confirmed he gave quaaludes, a powerful prescription sedative now banned in the United States, to the woman before they had sex in Las Vegas in the 1970s. He also admitted obtaining seven prescriptions for the hypnotic drug in the 1970s and giving it to other people who were not named. During the 2005 case his accuser's lawyer asked him: \"When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?\" Cosby replied \"Yes.\" His lawyers then prevented him from answering further questions. They said other people Cosby gave the drug to had known they were taking it. Sen. Gillibrand’s spokesman told Politico why she was supporting the petition for Cosby to have his medal revoked: “Kirsten has always advocated for listening to survivors’ voices. This 10-year-old admission is appalling, but sadly not surprising considering that dozens of women have been speaking out. “She supports this group’s effort because we need to set a clear example that sexual assault will not be tolerated in this country, and someone who admitted to using drugs for sex no longer deserves the nation’s highest honour.” Cosby, who became known as \"America's Dad\" when he starred in The Cosby Show in the 1980s, has never been charged with a crime, and the statute of limitations on most of the accusations against him has expired. He settled the 2005 case, which was brought by a university basketball coach, after offering her an education trust fund. His evidence from the case was kept private but a judge in Philadelphia made it public 10 years later following a legal challenge from the Associated Press. US District Judge Eduardo Robreno said the public had a right to know the \"stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct\". Cosby's lawyers have yet to comment. Follow @telewonderwomen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
