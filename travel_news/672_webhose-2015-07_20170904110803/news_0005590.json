(Pramod Thakur/HT photo) \nLauren Gottlieb’s wardrobe at her apartment in Andheri overflows with a number of hats, shoes and belts. Style for her is all about being who you are and having fun putting various pieces together. She replenishes her closet on trips to her hometown (Scottsdale, Arizona) in the US. \nWhat fashion means to you : “Fashion is a form of expression, just like dancing and acting is. It is my favourite way to express myself. What I wear in the morning defines my character for the day. I am a hyperactive person and love to put on some music while choosing my outfit.” \nAccessories galore : “I have a million hats, belts and gold bracelets. I love accessories (especially hats), and I feel every accessory has to go with the look. It can make or break an outfit.” \nFashion inspiration : “I grew up watching Sex and the City and loved Sarah Jessica Parker’s style. She was experimental in a way that no one else was. It was too cool.” \nFavourite city to shop in : “I love New York, London and Los Angeles.” \nWeather woes : “I love layering, and jackets are essential to my style but in Mumbai, all my jackets end up staying in the closet. I hardly get to wear them. I get excited when rains or when it gets even slightly chilly so I can finally wear them.” \nMost lavish purchase : “I own some Louis Vuitton and Jimmy Choo shoes. I love a sexy heel. Pencil heels make my day.” \nFashion faux pas : “It is tough to wear certain shoes in this city, but if you wear the wrong footwear, it can total ruin your look.” \nBrand unconscious : “My family wasn’t super wealthy. I would shop at Goodwill and Salvation Army stores, which had second-hand items. Growing up, I had fun matching different pieces to create a character. I never had a lot of money to buy brands, so I stay true to my roots even now.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T01:52:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
