We will therefore be the first point of call for travellers stopping in Jeddah en-route to the two Holy Cities, Makkah and Madinah,\" said Andreas Mattmüller, chief operating officer, Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts, Middle East and Asia. \nHe was speaking after a management deal was inked with Dr Mohamed Ali Al-Turki, chairman/CEO of Mohamed Al-Turki Group of Companies. \n\"Mövenpick has a strong track record in managing properties in Jeddah and across Saudi Arabia, which made the hospitality firm a natural partner for this exciting new venture,\" said Al-Turki. \nThe hotel will feature several food and beverage outlets including two signature restaurants, plus a ballroom, seven meeting rooms, health club with gym, and seven stand-alone villas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T00:06:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
