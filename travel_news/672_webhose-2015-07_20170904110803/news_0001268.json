A proportionate share had been allocated for 480 and 880 rice and corn farmers in Pikit town in nearby North Cotabato province.\nBoth officials considered the assistance package timely, as the region's mainly agricultural economy was severely affected by massive community displacement due to armed conflict, and the recent dry-spell and floods that hit Maguindanao, ARMM's top agriculture-producing province.\n\"The intervention is a follow through to a continuing commitment to help communities affected by the conflict in the Southern Philippines,\" said Fernandez.\nThe UN agency official foresaw\"a more strengthened collaboration,\" adding he hoped\"to be back soon to see the light of dawn enjoyed by all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:12:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
