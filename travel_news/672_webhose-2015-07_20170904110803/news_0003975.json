Those are the first things I think of. \nOn paper, that sounds like a terrible combination, but somehow, someway Istanbul makes it work. \nThe cigarettes are a sign of the city’s European lifestyle, where drinking tea, coffee or beer for hours on end is a daily ritual. \nThe seagulls connect you with the bustling waterfront that serves as Istanbul’s lifeblood. \nAnd… those ever-present, ridiculously obnoxious vanity poles called “selfie sticks” are proof that the city is one of the most picture-worthy places I’ve ever been. \nOver the course of the last two months, I’ve lived in four different locations, which has given me a few different sides to life in the city… \nThanks to an invitation by the Swissotel , I started my trip out with five-nights of luxury along the Bosphorus. From there, I moved over to Sultanahmet (old town), where the tourist population drove me away in just a few days. Next, I stayed with a friend over on the Asian side in Kadikoy – where I really enjoyed the laid back lifestyle. After a month of comfort, I needed a little more stimulation so I relocated to an apartment near Taksim Square, just off one of the city’s main shopping avenues. \nIf I lived in Istanbul long-term I would choose Kadikoy, but if you’re there for vacation, I highly recommend finding a place off of Istiklal street. Istiklal Caddesi near Taksim Square is one of the busiest shopping streets in the city A young girl looks watches the world pass from the trolly window down Istiklal Caddesi \nDespite a frequent change in locations, one thing always remained familiar… the food was absolutely delicious. \nI’ll talk much more about this on an upcoming video , but let’s just say Turkish food was definitely the highlight of Istanbul. \nStreet treats and spinning meats won me over from day one, and despite the language barrier, I could point and smile at most things on the menu. \nSpeaking of which… the Turkish language is very hard. The words are long and I just didn’t get it. Then again, I put very little effort into learning the language, which no doubt, effected my connection with the country. \nThe good news is however; I met some great people while living in Istanbul, which made the entire experience worth it. These new friends connected me with local hot spots and I was able to get a sense of life as a “townie” relatively quickly.
