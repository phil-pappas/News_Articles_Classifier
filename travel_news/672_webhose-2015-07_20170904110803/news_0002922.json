Some 39 forward-thinking CEOs, invited to Coworth Park in Ascot from all over the globe by Tata Communications, revelled in the Black Eyed Peas singer’s entrepreneurial tales of success and failure. “It’s an honour to be here,” said the Grammy Award-winner, wearing his trademark black hat, before revealing his interest in wearables, one of the most significant innovations of 2015. Tata Communications’ network carries almost a quarter of the world’s internet routes, so the company’s NEI summit was an ideal platform for will.i.am to talk about his passion for connected devices. will.i.am expressed his determination to continue to invest in technology and altruistic causes. “It’s the hardest thing in the world, using your own money, and no one believing in you because you are supposed to stay in music,” said will.i.am, who owned a founding stake in Beats Electronics, purchased by Apple for £1.93bn in May 2014. I want the kids in the ghetto I’m from to know that we are more than our perceived limitations. We are the future. The next innovation can come from us “When you believe in something, nothing is going to hold you back, no matter if your pocket is burning your skin – and if you are making hardware your pockets are going to burn your skin. I don’t mind taking a risk, shedding blood, to raise opportunities or awareness of certain things.” will.i.am spoke about his i.am.angel foundation and i.am. College Track that encourage teenagers to pursue careers in technology by teaching hundreds how to write code and build robots. “Because I want the kids in the ghetto I’m from to know that we are more than our perceived limitations. We are the future. The next innovation can come from us.” Vinod Kumar, managing director and CEO of Tata Communications, told delegates that “innovation happens at the intersection of diversity”. Tata Communications, the flagship telecoms arm of the £66.1bn Tata group, aims to be in the vanguard of technological progress. Mr Kumar added: “I’m a huge Black Eyed Peas fan, but the reason Will is here is to add to the concept of diversity. We have leaders from 17 different sectors, nine countries, and companies large and small. We have those from technology start-ups, the medical devices industry, healthcare, musicians, and big industrial groups, and I hope the dialogue will be enriched by that diversity. You never know if this kind of collision is going to lead to something. “I am your host but, more importantly, my team and I are students. We’re here to learn how you are innovating as businesses. We want to learn how you find your success and we want to see where you see the world going.” On the first evening, David Coulthard, the former Formula One driver, spoke of the importance of technology in his sport, with which Tata Communications has enjoyed a technology partnership since 2012. The second day was packed with seminars from luminaries including Dr Lynda Gratton, professor of management practice at London Business School, and Scott D Anthony, author and adviser for innovation in large corporations. There were also breakout sessions when Jack Hidary, founder of the Clinton Global Initiative and adviser to Google X Labs, tasked groups of delegates to disrupt their own businesses. Wearables were shared out, virtual reality was showcased, and, thanks to a successful NEI, Tata Communications will remain on the cusp of innovation in a world which is forecast to be fully connected to the internet in the next decade. What delegates learn from NEI Kathryn Parsons Co-founder and Co-CEO Decoded \"It’s important to realise that as a leader you’re someone that people want to follow. You have to understand your workforce and constantly invest in their talent and skills. Knowing how to motivate a whole team is fascinating. And being authentic, too, is vital. You can’t lie, or make up a belief or a purpose – this generation is so transparent. For businesses big and small, no matter what your purpose, be honest as a leader, and be the kind of person that people genuinely want to follow.\" Scott D Anthony Managing Partner Innosight \"One thing that strikes you about Tata Communications and the whole Tata group of companies is how open it is to innovation. Tata’s Dare to Try award is brilliant, because it tells people it is OK to attempt things that don’t work out. True innovation almost always has false steps, left turns, surprises, mistakes and accidents. If you are not conditioned to deal with that, you are never going to get the results from it. There is a huge mind-set shift that leaders have to make. If you want to do anything big, start small. That’s the advice I give people who are scared. Take a small step and see what happens.\" See how you can connect your business at tatacommunications.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:41:05.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
