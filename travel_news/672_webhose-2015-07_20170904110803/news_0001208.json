Picture: Simon Cross Source: News Corp Australia\n“As a midfield group last week that was disappointing and we don’t like putting that performance out on the park, but to bounce back the way we did and have weight of numbers through the midfield today was really pleasing for the group.\n“And with the medal — I’m honoured, I’m honoured.”\nDespite the occasion — a sold-out Showdown 39 dubbed as a tribute game for Walsh — Thompson said he was not overcome by emotion during the game.\n“You look back on today’s game and it definitely had a lot of meaning — Phil spent the last nine months as the bloke in charge here and many, many years at Port Adelaide so there was always going to be a little bit of emotion around today’s game,” he said.\n“But I think we got most of that out of the system against West Coast last week.\nThe Showdown in pictures.\n“There was definitely no fear, the game was hot early, that was a finals-like game today and to Port’s credit we knew they were going to throw everything at us in that last quarter.\n“They had to and it was a little bit close for comfort in the end but I’m extremely proud of the boys’ efforts today.”\nThompson had high praise for his young teammates with six in last night’s Showdown having less than 20 games’ experience.\n“It goes to show we’ve got great depth, Rory Atkins plays his first game, Riley Knight is playing his second game and Scott (Camporeale) has already touched on the fact that we’ve got competition for spots now, which is healthy for the group,” Thompson said.\n“It’s good that we can bring guys in now, contribute and play their roll and gives us great confidence with the depth of the list.”", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/19/1227448/173180-b9767ab8-2dfb-11e5-acc9-b1d2ead0aaf5.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T20:24:19.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
