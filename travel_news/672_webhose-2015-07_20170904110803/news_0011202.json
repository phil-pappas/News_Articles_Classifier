I'd be looking to buy any dip in the market,\" he said. \nChina is the world's biggest metals consumer but a sharp sell-off in its stock market over the last few weeks has raised concerns over its economy. \nThis in turn has impacted mining stocks, with miners such as Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) missing out on the broader market rally on Friday, falling back as copper and metals prices dropped on worries about demand in China. \n\"With Chinese shares seeing their worst month in 6 years, it's hardly surprising that investors aren't keen to hold onto their commodity shares going into August,\" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
