The boat was full. There were 150-200 people on it. When we came back, another boat was going out full,” Josephides said. “There is no doubt that June is not as good as they [Greece] expected but we know that because we can see our figures.” \nHe added: “Everybody here just looks flabbergasted when you explain to them what’s being said about things in England.” \nAlthough there is no limit for foreign withdrawals from cash machines, Sunvil and Olympic Holidays have put in place measures to offer funds to tourists in resort. \nPhotis Lambrianides, commercial director at Olympic Holidays, said: “The enjoyment and wellbeing of tourists is not going to be affected.” \nHe said Olympic would be able to cope if Greece exited the eurozone. \nHe added: “If it does happen, it’s going to benefit tourists because effectively whatever currency they adopt, it will be devalued and the prices in resort will become cheaper and will benefit tourists.” \nChris Wright, Sunvil’s managing director, said: “The main concern was because the banks were closed and the restaurants wouldn’t be able to buy food and that sort of thing. \n“Once we’d reassured them [customers] that all the restaurants were open and tourists can actually get cash out of the cash machines, then there wasn’t really an issue.” \nThe Foreign Office has raised the possibility of more demonstrations and suggests travellers take enough cash to cover their stay. \nThe UK arm of the Greek National Tourism Organisation said the Ministry for Economy, Infrastructure, Shipping and \nTourism did not “anticipate any inconvenience in visitors’ everyday holiday experiences… as there are adequate fuel supplies, products and services.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:18:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
