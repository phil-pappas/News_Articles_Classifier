A year ago, the 23-year-old single mother was hunting for jobs, cleaning or ironing, anything to help support her daughter. Now she is thinking big, putting together a business plan to raise financing for her dream – a beauty salon of her own. Inside the conference room that has been her classroom for almost a year, Maria delivers a torrent of carefully costed numbers and describes how a coffee shop would add extra income for her business. “Any questions?” she asks her audience of classmates and visitors with a little smile, as her presentation comes to a close. Over coffee and biscuits she describes how far she has come. Not just learning about coffee farming and running a business, but in developing the skills that mean she can speak in front of an audience. This is the first time I have been able to speak in front of other people “My mother was very overprotective and wouldn't let me out much,” she says. “This is the first time I have been able to speak in front of other people.” There is a reason why her mother, who had brought up her daughter alone, was overprotective. The feared street gangs of Honduras wield power in Maria’s home town. The sugar fields outside the town are known as a dumping ground for bodies. So when Maria had a baby at the age of 17, before she finished school, it strained relations with her mother, who feared she was wasting her life and would never work her way out of the family's difficult circumstances. Twice Maria fled to the US to try to find work, and twice was deported. If it wasn't for the course, she says, she would have tried for a third time. At the family home, her mother, Lesby, describes how she worried about the future of her only daughter and the risks from the gangs. “We are humble people so I was worried that she might be susceptible,” she says, sitting in the shade of washing drying on a clothes line, in the sticky heat of June. “Kids, when they are younger, they rebel, but thank God she has not been a big headache.” But, as both readily admit with a broad grin, the young Maria was often quite a bit of a headache. Now, as Maria cuddles her daughter, also called Lesby, her mother says she can trust her again. “I have confidence that when she goes out, she will come home,” she says. And she describes a mother's pride at seeing a previously quiet, shy daughter stand up to talk about the Kenco project at a public meeting. “There are so many changes. There was a meeting recently and I saw her stand up and express herself. It made me very proud,” she says, her eyes glistening at the memory. “She is more confident. When she comes home, she is talking about her plans. She has ideas and is enthusiastic.” You may also be interested in: • Video: Visiting the Coffee vs Gangs farm • The Honduras coffee region by numbers • Coffee production: from seedling to coffee cup • Discover more about the Coffee vs Gangs project and gang culture here telegraph.co.uk/coffeevsgangs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:33:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
