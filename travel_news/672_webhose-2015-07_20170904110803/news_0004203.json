It's become a symbol for Key Largo's John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, which is part of the sanctuary. \nThe statue, a replica of a sculpture in Italy, is a tourist attraction for snorkelers, divers and passengers on glass-bottom boats who can see it from the surface. \nTo mark the anniversary, the Amoray Dive Resort in Key Largo is sponsoring a contest with a prize of an underwater wedding at the statue and a stay at the resort for the best 100-word essay from a couple who would like to be married under the sea.
