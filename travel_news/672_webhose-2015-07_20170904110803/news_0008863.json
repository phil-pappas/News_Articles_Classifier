Hosting high-profile global events of this calibre, not only raises the city’s profile on the international stage, but brings widespread benefits direct to Edinburgh businesses. “1,425 delegates staying in Edinburgh for four nights generates hundreds of thousands of pounds for local hotels, venue and their suppliers. But, the city’s visitor attractions, restaurants, shops, taxis and trams also benefit as delegates enjoy a memorable experience in the city. It’s a win-win scenario.” Art Tipton, President, Controlled Release Society said: “As the premier society in delivery science, we are thrilled to be bringing the CRS Annual Meeting to Edinburgh. This is a city with a world-wide reputation for its medical research and innovation. Add to the mix the high calibre of large-scale venues and accommodation options available, plus the stunning cityscape, it has proven to be a hugely popular host city choice with our members. Over the next few days we will be talking about improving human health and welfare through the controlled delivery of drugs, nutraceuticals, flavours, fragrances, and other functional ingredients.

International conferences of this scale bring great benefit to the whole city and it is anticipated that the Controlled Release Society’s conference, which has brought 1,425 delegates from 52 counties, will generate in excess of £3m in economic impact. Attracting events such as this to Edinburgh takes a great degree of collaboration from partners across the city, and they can take several years to plan, so there is always a sense of pride when we see the event taking place.” Neil Brownlee, Head of Business Events at VisitScotland, said: “This event is excellent news for the city. Edinburgh boasts such a rich history in medical and medicinal research and academic achievement, so this is a natural fit for the CRS Annual Meeting. We’re delighted to support this prestigious event and I’m sure the delegates will have a wonderful time exploring Scotland’s capital.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:01:25.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
