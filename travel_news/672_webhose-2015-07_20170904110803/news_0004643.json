Until now, tickets could not be sold to passengers awaiting connecting flights in terminals beyond checkpoints, meaning that only one-third of 96 million travelers who pass through the airport each year have had access to lottery ticket sales, Joe Kim , Georgia Lottery senior vice president and general counsel told WSB-TV. “There's really no other venue in the state that can match that and that's why we are really excited to be there,” Kim said. Ticket sales beyond security checkpoints are expected to begin within a month or two. The Georgia Lottery Corp.’s games in fiscal 2015 pulled in $980.5 million for the Georgia Treasury’s Lottery for Education Account, beating fiscal 2014’s transfer by more than $35.4 million, Atlanta Business Chronicle recently reported. \nWant Atlanta Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox?
