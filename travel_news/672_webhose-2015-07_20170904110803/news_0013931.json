Half an hour later he complained again and was reportedly moved to a crew seat. \nThe court heard however that he was forced to return to his original seat later for security reasons, once for another hour and then again for the final 90 minutes of the flight. \nBassos claims that the flight gave him a back injury, and exacerbated a pre-existing back condition. He is now seeking damages for personal injuries. \nIn defence, Etihad has argued that it is not an unusual occurrence to have overweight passengers taking up extra space on a plane. However Judge Fleur Kingham said this was no reason to strike out the claim, and has now ordered Bassos to take a medical exam in Brisbane in December. \nHer reasoning also stated that she wasn’t convinced that Bassos had no chance of winning the case. \nAn Etihad Airways spokesman told Telegraph Travel today: “It would be inappropriate to comment in detail on this case as legal proceedings are underway. \n“Etihad Airways will continue to oppose the action and now that Mr Bassos will finally face a medical assessment in December 2015, as directed by court, we believe that the matter will proceed to an early conclusion.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:24:42.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
