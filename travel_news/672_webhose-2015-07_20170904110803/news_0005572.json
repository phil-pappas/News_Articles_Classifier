The latter is true of the north-east Aegean, which includes a hodgepodge of islands stretching from lush Samos in the south – just off the coast of Turkey – up to Thassos, 400km to the north and closer to Bulgaria than it is to Athens.\nIn between are an isolated stretch of islands, often far apart from each other and not well connected. Perhaps because of this, and the difficulty of labelling them easily together, these islands are often overlooked. For those prepared to travel a bit further afield, this is a bonus as, apart from midsummer, they tend to be uncrowded and unspoilt.\nSamos is the nearest thing this group gets to “well-known destination”, but it is still more easily reached from Turkey than most of the rest of Greece . It does have its resorts but is big and diverse enough to still reward visitors. It is probably the most instantly attractive of the group.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Calm waters … Lesbos. Photograph: Getty Images/Flickr RF Heading west, little Fourni is getting increasing recognition as an “unspoilt” gem, and still deserves the reputation. Larger Ikaria is a different kettle of fish and, while not immediately pretty, is worth exploring: the locals have an independent and proud streak that sets them apart.\nRelated: Greek island holiday guide: the Ionian islands\nChios and Lesbos also hug the Turkish coast. The former has a long and often tragic history but hides many beautiful places away from its couple of beach resorts. Lesbos is one of the biggest of all the Greek islands, and a long visit and exploration will reveal why it is still beloved by artists, historians and modern Sapphos .\nIn the north is a scattering of volcanic islands that remain off-the-beaten track. Limnos has become trendy, especially among mainland Greeks, but remains beautiful and authentic. Samothrace is one of the most dramatic of the Greek islands and is home to a stunning and world-class ancient site. And if you want to see how Greeks party, Thassos is your place.\nAll prices are for one week’s accommodation for two in August, and include breakfast unless otherwise stated. Prices outside of this month can be considerably cheaper. Greek taverna prices are remarkably similar and, if anything, have gone down in the last few years. You can usually expect to eat well for €15-€20 per head. If places are cheaper or more expensive than this, it is stated in the text.\nSamos Armonia Bay Hotel Where to stay\nArmonia Bay\nThis is exactly what you hope for from a Greek island hotel. The simple rooms are large and tastefully done, and most have balconies with great views down to the beach, which is a five-minute stroll away – although there’s a pool if you can’t manage that. The hospitality is relaxed and friendly.\n• £560, +30 22730 92279, armoniabay.com ; family-friendly\nWhere to eat\nPnaka\nFor the best food you should head up to the hillside villages above. This meze place has a great terrace in the village of the same name, and serves a great mixture of small dishes and salads to mix and match.

Photograph: Peter Forsberg/Alamy Don’t miss\nMost museums on the islands are only for the real enthusiast. The one in Vathy (the Archaeological Museum), the capital of Samos, is an exception, and has one of Greece’s largest statues as its prize exhibit. The old upper town of Vathy is also worth a stroll.\n• +30 2273 027469\nFourni A fishing boat at Thymena Island, Fourni.

The key to this is its large fishing fleet, which means the island’s seafood tavernas are first class. There are a couple of prominent ones by the port, and Nikos is perhaps the best choice. Lobster pasta is an island speciality.\n• +30 22750 51207\nDon’t miss\nA short boat ride from Fourni is the even smaller island of Thymena. The population of barely 100 lives mainly in the little port. A short hike takes you over to an isolated beach and taverna – bliss.\nIkaria Restaurant overlooking fisherman’s bay, Ikaria. Photograph: Alamy Where to stay\nThe Ikarian Winery\nEccentric Ikaria takes a little getting to know, and there is no better place to do that than at this agri-tourism-themed vineyard near the island’s north coast. It has a cluster of traditionally-decorated cottages and is still producing its own wines –offering the opportunity to get involved with production, as well as sample the product.\n• £490, +30 22750 31151, ikarianwine.gr ; family-friendly\nRelated: Greek island holiday guide: the Dodecanese\nArtemis Studios\nThese simple studios are all about location, with superb sunset views down to one of the prettiest coves in Greece.

This one is just above the small village of Avlaki, serves 40 different dishes, and does an interesting sideline in Moroccan tagines.\n• +30 22750 71009, ilias.com.gr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artemis Studios Nas\nIf anything this taverna’s terrace has even better views, and the hearty meals carry on the theme of value for money. Also, you can’t help but be tempted to follow the river canyon below to the sheltered cove itself, which is surrounded by wind and wave sculpted rock. It’s a beautiful place, but be careful not to swim too far out as the currents can be deceptively strong.\n• +30 22750 71486\nDon’t miss\nThe Ikarians like to do things differently. The four villages of Raches are linked by a well-mapped hiking trail, something that is becoming more common in Greece. They also run on “Ikarian time”. The villagers sleep for much of the day, then open up their shops and tavernas for most of the night.\nChios Facebook Twitter Pinterest Houses of Pygri, Chios. Photograph: Alamy Where to stay\nPerleas Estate\nIn the interior of this popular island is this superbly-restored old mansion set in four acres of land now given over to organic fruit, olives and vegetables.

For the carnivore this is heaven (in particular try kokoretsi if it’s on the day’s menu – just don’t ask what it is first) but don’t worry if that’s not your thing as there are plenty of other dishes. .\n• +30 22740 22045\nDon’t miss\nChios made its fortune from the harvesting of mastic, a tree resin once chewed in the harems of Ottoman Istanbul. The product is just a curiosity now, but the villages that were based around the industry still make worthwhile visit. The houses of striking Pyrgi are decorated with whitewash patterns on top of the black, volcanic rock underneath.\nLesbos Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Getty Images/Flickr RF Where to stay\nAphrodite\nLesbos, with its artistic associations has plenty of boutique getaways; the Aphrodite, on a long stretch of isolated beach, is something a bit more old-school: a classic seaside Greek hotel, down to the two-ring electric hobs in the studios. Don’t expect sophistication, but enjoy the friendly welcome from the Hahathakis family and the relaxed atmosphere.\n• £280, +30 22520 61288, aphroditehotel.gr ; family-friendly\nWhere to eat\nAkrotiri\nAt the west end of Vatera beach is the little port of Ayios Fokas, where this seafood taverna is by the sparse ruins of a temple to Dionysus.

It is topped by an impressive Byzantine castle that has superb views.\nLimnos Photograph: Alamy Where to stay\nEthaleia\nThis is a lovely little hotel with a warm heart. Dina, one of the couple who have put their souls into this establishment, is a local, and her love of the land and its culture shines through. The 10 rooms are often booked up by return visitors, and given the views and hospitality you can see why.\n• £400, +30 69443 55755, ethaleia.gr\nSurf Club Keros\nGlamping arrives in Greece! The Surf Club provides luxury safari tents right by the beautiful beach of Keros Bay.

Apparently named after Nelson Mandela, everything else about this place is very Greek: hearty portions of local food are served with a smile.\n• +30 22540 61349\nDon’t miss\nWhat else to do at the Surf Club Keros but try the waves? Lessons and equipment are available in surfing, kite-surfing and windsurfing for adults and children. The surrounding nature area is also well worth an explore, or just a gentle stroll. One of the best things to do on Limnos is to explore its villages and dramatic landscapes. The latter can be seen by visiting the cave chapel of Panagía Kakaviótissa. It’s a stiff, if short, climb, but the views are well worth it.\nSamothrace (Samothraki) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ancient hellenistic theatre at the Sanctuary of Great Gods, Samothrace. Photograph: Alamy Where to stay\nArchondissa\nSet in its own, lovely, gardens, and right by the beach on the edge of the village of Therma, these apartments are spacious and well furnished. Terraces offer views either to the crystal clear sea or up to Mount Fengari, the highest in the Aegean (you can climb it from here, but it’s a good six hours each way).\n• £280, +30 25510 98098, archondissa.gr ; family-friendly\nWhere to eat\nPerivoli T’Ouranou\nThis nearby taverna sells all the standards to a good quality, with the added bonus of having regular, and sometimes spontaneous, live music performances.\n• +30 25510 98313\nArchondissa apartment Don’t miss\nSamothrace is a visually stunning island and there is nowhere better to appreciate this than the Sanctuary of the Great Gods. This cult was worshipped here for over 1,000 years, and the site still evokes awe in the visitor.\nThassos Where to stay\nThassos Inn\nThassos can be on the lively side, so it can be nice to get away from it all. This hotel dominates the quiet and attractive hilltop village of Panayia. It’s bright yellow buildings are set round a terrace of plane trees and a carp-filled pools, while inside the simple rooms have terraces with great views.\n• £320, +30 25930 61612, thassosinn.gr\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Thassos Inn Where to eat\nDrosia\nAlso in Panayia, this is another reliable standard taverna, specialising in grilled meat, but also offering good sardines and mussels.\n• +30 25930 61340\nDon’t miss\nThassos is a destination for Greeks (especially those from Thessaloniki) who are looking for entertainment. The island is overpopulated with bouzouki bars, and it’s worth giving them a go, even if only for one night. Ideally go with Greek friends and don’t expect to be home before dawn and without a fair amount of whisky inside you.\nGetting to the north-east Aegean The larger, southern islands of the chain can be reached by ferry from Athens, and plane from Athens and other places in Greece. In summer, charter flights run from abroad. Limnos can be reached from Thessaloniki by ferry. The two northern islands of Thassos and Samothrace are a more difficult prospect. Ferries run from the northern mainland ports of Kavala and Alexandropouli respectively.\nAndrew Bostock is the author of the Bradt Travel Guide Greece: The Peloponnese – new edition out spring 2016",
