An excuse to sit around for days in the sunshine, catch up on your reading, eat amazing food and explore new places. But as anyone who has ever mislaid their passport or been scammed by a taxi driver will know, they're also full of pitfalls that can ruin your break and end up costing you significant amounts of time and money . Here are the most common holiday mishaps - and some advice from the experts on how to avoid them. Before you go The FCO has a handy travel checklist of things to sort out before you go away. The most important ones are jabs, travel insurance, visas and passports. Never skip the travel insurance - it might seem like a money saving measure but if something happens to you or your possessions while you're abroad the costs can quickly spiral if you're not insured. Check out the rules specific to where you're travelling, too - a 16-year-old from London recently narrowly avoided being thrown in a jail cell in Istanbul after it emerged he only had two weeks left on his passport. You need at least six months left before the expiry date to travel to Turkey. Make sure you check out the visa situation too, and get your jabs booked in. You need to take some anti-malarials for several weeks before you travel. Get your visas in that passport well in advance If you need a new passport get it sorted with plenty of time to spare to avoid a lot of stress and a time-consuming trip to the passport office. The airport If you're flying long-haul, wear clothes that you'll be happy to sit and sleep in for hours on end - so no tight jeans or short skirts if you think you'll find them uncomfortable. It might be tempting to crack out the beach shorts in anticipation of the sunshine that awaits, but bear in mind that airports and planes can be very, very air-conditioned. Brrr. Check in online if you can, and don't forget the annoying plastic bag they make you put your liquids in - they're charging Â£1 for two at some airports now. It's probably a good idea to pack enough stuff to survive on for a couple of days in your hand luggage - assume that the airline will lose your bags, and carry a toothbrush, spare underwear and all your valuables with you. Arriving Check out the taxi situation at the airport you're flying into. Walking unprepared out of an airport into a waiting taxi scrum can be the most stressful bit of the holiday. In some places there's a stand with a flat rate for cabs, and in others it's a bit of a lottery as to whether you end up with a legitimate taxi or a charlatan who'll charge you an extortionate rate and try to nick your luggage.

Getting around Note the above warning about taxis. Depending on where you are it might be a good idea to learn how to say 'Use the meter, please', in the local language, or be prepared to haggle. Don't miss out on the local transport system - tuk tuks in Vietnam, trams in Budapest and the metro in Moscow are all attractions in themselves. Maps are probably a good idea At some ferry ports and bus stations scammers will flag you down before you reach the terminal and tell you that it's closed - before redirecting you to their travel agency, who will siphon off a portion of the ticket price. Many people like to carry their passport on them at all times - if you're going to do this keep it on you in a money-belt. Consider whether it might be safer in a locked safe at your hotel . Food and drink In many parts of the world it's probably a good idea to avoid ice in drinks, and be a bit careful about ice cream too. Many an intrepid traveller has been reduced to a homesick mess by a sudden onset of traveller's diarrhoea . Watch out for the ice Street food can be okay but make sure it's being cooked in front of you. And don't accept food or drink from strangers in public - it can be a distraction ploy for a pickpocketing scam. Culture and events Keep an eye on your stuff in big crowds and at events. Don't use back pockets, and don't leave valuables at the top of a rucksack on your back. Money belts are always a good idea . Experts say pickpockets strike in places where everybody's looking up . Don't fall for scams like bracelet-sellers and palm-readers, who literally grab hold of your hands and refuse to let go until you pay them. Don't keep your valuables in here (Photo: Jonathan Lodge) And the same principle applies with ticketed events as with travel - make sure you're buying from an official vendor, not a dodgy travel agent. Getting home Book your taxi to the airport in advance - you don't want to be caught out with no means of transport and two hours until your flight leaves. If it's a morning flight, and especially if you insist on having a big night out the evening before, set several alarms. If you miss your flight and it's your own fault, they're unlikely to transfer you for free . And you don't want to end your holiday begging a checking desk agent who barely speaks English to let you on the plane.
