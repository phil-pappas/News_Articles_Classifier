Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Summary \nThe creator of Knott’s Berry Farm’s Supreme Scream and the Stratosphere's Big Shot in Las Vegas has created a new attraction in Logan. \nStan Checketts is a 74-year-old grandfather who loves to throw his grandchildren into the air as they giggle with delight. \nAnd thanks to his career, he gets to do the same thing for adults. \nChecketts, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from Cache Valley, Utah, has been inventing thrill rides and attractions for 40 years, and his resume is impressive. According to a press release from Soaring Eagle Inc., Checketts has more of his rides in amusement parks than any other person in the entertainment industry. In 1997 , he was named National Entrepreneur of the Year by USA Today. \nHis thrill rides have been featured in the Guinness Book of World Records, and he was highlighted in Rolling Stone Magazine on Aug. 22, 2002, according to the Logan Herald Journal . Among his well-known attractions are Knott’s Berry Farm’s Supreme Scream and the Big Shot on top of the Stratosphere in Las Vegas. \nChecketts’ latest invention was revealed at Renegade Sports in Logan on May 20. The new structure is a three-in-one thrill ride, which includes three “thrills”— the Aerial Dive Ride, the Saddle Sling and the Daring Drop. \n“This is what gets my heart excited,” said Checketts as he pointed to his newest attraction the morning of its reveal. “I just love to thrill people. That’s my life. If I can watch someone screaming and squealing and having a good time, I’m motivated. That’s what drives me; that’s what makes me excited.” \nSandy Checketts, Stan Checketts’ wife, said being married to a thrill ride creator is an “endless party.” \n“He’s always a ton of fun,” Sandy Checketts said. “He works nonstop, but he loves it. He has so much passion for what he does. He is the only person I know who, on Sunday night, paces the floor saying, ‘I wish it was Monday morning already! I wish I could just go to work!’ He just loves what he does, and it’s infectious. It’s fun to have someone that positive and exciting around the kids, grandkids and great-grandkids.” \nStan Checketts started out in what he calls the “bungee days.” He obtained patents for bungee towers and built them all over the world. The industry took off. \nAccording to Checketts, people started getting hurt on other companies’ bungee systems, which began a sharp decline in the popularity of bungee jumping. He said these injuries ruined the sport for him. But as a result of these failures, Checketts began thinking more creatively about how he could continue to safely thrill people. \n“‘I know — I can throw them in the air!’” Checketts said he remembers thinking to himself. “That’s what I would do with my kids when they were little. I’d just take them and toss them in the air and catch them safely. So then I thought, ‘I’ll build a space shot, and I will throw them in the air 185 feet.’” \nAs the father of nine children and a grandfather to 30 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, Checketts is devoted to his family and his faith. \n“We are heavily involved with the youth in the (LDS) Church, so we are with the young women and young men a lot,” Sandy Checketts said. “They are always asking him questions and introducing him to their friends, so it’s really fun.” \nQuin Checketts, Stan Checketts' fourth son, said it has been a unique and amazing opportunity to be raised by a father who is passionate about thrill rides.
