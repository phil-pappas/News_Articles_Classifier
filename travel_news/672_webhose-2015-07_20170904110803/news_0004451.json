Strong latches on your windows? Do you always lock your doors and windows? Have a barky dog?\nIf you can answer “yes” to the first three questions, you’re way ahead when it comes to home security. (You get extra credit for the dog.) Because most burglars enter homes by simply opening unlocked doors or windows — or pushing and kicking locked ones until they open — even the most basic measures of protection will improve security.\nAlthough it doesn’t take a genius to get at your stuff, the good news is that the rate of burglaries is fairly slim: Only about 1 in 50 U.S. homes gets broken into each year. But given the financial, physical and psychological damage that can result from the crime, it makes sense to do what you can to become more secure.\nBasic steps Many of the most effective home security strategies cost nothing or very little:\n• Get insurance. Consider adding replacement-cost coverage to your homeowners or renters insurance policy for your personal property. If burglars clean out your house, this optional coverage could save you thousands of dollars compared with standard coverage. If you possess expensive jewelry and other items covered at low limits under standard policies, consider taking out additional policies for them.\n(Illustration by Michael Driver for The Washington Post) • Get a security audit. Most police departments provide such services, which will help you identify vulnerabilities.\n• ID your stuff. Many experts recommend participating in Operation Identification, which involves engraving an ID number on your valuables and putting a decal in your window.\n• Keep valuables out of easy sight. You probably open your front door to many strangers and near-strangers — the pizza delivery guy, political canvassers, the sketchy home improvement salesmen who are “doing work in the neighborhood,” among others. Place articles of ostensible value out of the view of anyone at your front door or anyone looking through your front windows from the street.\n•Get to know your neighbors. Neighborhood watch groups are one of the most effective ways to protect all the homes in your neighborhood. At the very least, get to know your neighbors and share your vacation plans, so everyone can look out for suspicious activities.\n•Keep up appearances. Because most burglars strike when no one is home, make sure your house always appears occupied. Leaving lights and a TV on helps. If you go on vacation, work with neighbors or friends to prevent mail and packages from piling up and to keep your lawn mowed.\n•Keep your landscaping in check. Doors and windows hidden by bushes and trees (as well as garages and fences) are attractive targets for intruders who prefer to invade unseen.\n•Light it up. Many burglars will flee if they activate an outdoor light connected to a motion detector.\n•Keep track of keys.\n•Get a dog. Many burglars avoid homes with noisy, furry family members.\nDefend vulnerable spots Because most intruders break in through poorly secured doors and windows, make yours as difficult as possible to penetrate. Although intruders prefer unlocked doors and windows, many can quickly and almost silently pry open locked ones. Some break a pane of glass so they can reach in and unlock the window or door. Only a few really determined burglars break out enough glass to walk or crawl through, or bash in a well-secured door, and they seldom try to pick locks.\n• Lose lousy locks. Key-in-the knob locks are inadequate. Install good deadbolt locks on all your exterior doors.\n• Scrutinize sliding glass doors. The locks on sliding glass doors are notoriously flimsy — many doors can be lifted right off their tracks. Numerous how-to videos on the Web can show you how to make yours more secure, or you can pay a locksmith to evaluate the vulnerability of your doors and, if necessary, install reinforcements.\n• Replace weak doors. Solid-wood doors are much sturdier than hollow ones. Many homeowners in high-crime neighborhoods install metal bar doors.\n• Secure your windows. Depending on the type of window, you can take various steps to make it more resistant to a prying attack. Double-hung windows, for example, can be secured by screwing together the two frames. Most intruders are not keen on breaking glass, but it still happens often enough to justify concern. For the highest level of protection, the window should have unbreakable glazing or steel bars across it.\n• Hide valuables. Stash cash and expensive jewelry in unlikely places — for example, in a large envelope or among many paper files. Be sure to select containers no one will accidentally discard.\n• Rent a safe deposit box. A box may be inconvenient, but it provides a level of security against theft and fire that cannot be duplicated at home unless you spend thousands of dollars on a vault.\n•Lock up guns. Burglaries are major sources of guns for criminals.\nShould you get an alarm? For millions of American households, an alarm system is one component of a home security plan, and there is much evidence that these systems do make a difference in deterring burglaries. In addition, alarm systems can help prevent fire damage, and some alert you (or a central monitoring agency) about power outages, water leaks and other problems.\nThe amount of protection a burglar alarm system provides depends on how well you have secured the perimeter of your house, the design of the alarm system, the quality of the installation and how often you activate the system.\nWe recommend that homeowners first improve physical barriers to intrusion (some of which are discussed above) before considering alarm systems. Alarms can add protection against intrusions, but they also involve a significant expense and have some drawbacks.\nLiving with an alarm system is at best a minor inconvenience, at worst enough of a hassle that many homeowners don’t use theirs regularly.\nAnd false alarms are not merely inconvenient: They cause fear, erode neighbors’ goodwill and in many jurisdictions result in fines. According to various estimates, 80 to 98 percent of alarm alerts are false — a serious problem for police departments.\nBasic alarm protection should cover all exterior doors (including sliding glass doors) and any windows easily reached by intruders. The system should also activate a siren and/or notify a central monitoring station. Professional installation of a system meeting these criteria usually costs $1,000 to $2,000. Some companies offer steep discounts to customers who sign long-term monitoring contracts. With these companies, you can get a basic system for less than $500 if you sign a three-year monitoring deal.\nModerately heavy alarm protection covers other points of potential entry, including second-story windows, attic doors and skylights. It will also use motion detectors, pressure pads and sensors on cabinets and bureaus to detect intrusions past the perimeter when the family is asleep or away. Such systems usually cost from $1,500 to more than $3,000.\nEven if you buy a home security system with all the bells and whistles, it might not do you any good if it’s designed poorly or installed sloppily. The ratings and reviews submitted to Checkbook, plus reports from our mystery shoppers, indicate that the expertise of home security representatives varies greatly.\nSome appear to know little about actual alarm installation, spend minimal time inspecting homes and have no clear idea of how their installation crews will complete the work. Many seem more interested in explaining their products than in figuring out how to give customers what they request. And with some salespeople, it takes considerable time and energy to get an explicit price for your job.\nOn the other hand, some companies’ representatives are true experts. Many salespeople have performed installation work, and some install the alarm systems they plan themselves. These representatives take a good look around the house, check inside closets, inspect the basement and other unfinished spaces, and bang on walls.\nYou’ll also find huge company-to-company price differences. When Checkbook’s mystery shoppers collected proposals for alarm systems and three years of monitoring services for two different homes, they were Quote: d prices ranging from $1,847 to $4,420 for one of the homes and $1,839 to $3,552 for the other home.\nWhen obtaining bids for alarm-system installation, discuss payment terms. The more you can pay after the job is complete, the better. The best arrangement is to pay a chunk of the installation price 15 or 30 days after completion: It gives you maximum leverage if any problems need to be corrected.\nAnd check the company’s monitoring agreement for any provisions that require auto-renewal. Some companies will automatically renew their monitoring service for a year or more. Because some companies routinely increase their monthly monitoring charges, strict auto-renewing agreements can be bad deals for you.\nWashington Consumers’ Checkbook ratings For detailed advice, including ratings of home security system installers and locksmiths, visit www.checkbook.org/washingtonpost/security .
