There is not a level playing field - TNCS are getting bigger not smaller and are playing their own rules,\" he said,\nThe discussion took place at the GBTA Convention in Orlando, Florida, and followed GBTA research published at the event which showed 71 per cent of companies don't have a policy for ride-sharing and one in four ban employees using these services.\nThe study showed that while safety of travellers was regarded as being paramount, not all buyers were aware of specific aspects of duty of care.\nOnly around one-third of business travellers were familiar with issues such as pre-employment driver certification, driver training requirements, and regulations affecting different types of ground transport services.\nThe research also showed buyers were “more familiar” with most aspects of the duty of care than travellers themselves, but less than a quarter of buyers were \"very familiar\" with all of them.\nGBTA executive director Michael McCormick added: “A large number of companies still have not adopted policies around ride-sharing companies, revealing a need for education about the benefits and the risks.”\nAlso speaking on the panel was David Seelinger, chairman and CEO of Empire CLS Worldwide Chauffeured Services, who echoed many of the same concerns.\n“When you come into a market and ignore all state laws and regulations then that is what causes concerns,” he said. “There's no balance between the chauffeured industry and TNCs. We even extended an invite for them to join us on this panel but they didn't want to enter the discussion.”\nSeelinger added: “We have to abide by rules, we have to give them employees rights such as the right to unionise, and yet none of these [ride-sharing] companies have to follow these rules. They should be required to do this - some of them have grown to be bigger than the whole industry.”\nThe GBTA survey was conducted online with 810 business travellers and 211 travel buyers in June 2015.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-07-29T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:06:59.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
