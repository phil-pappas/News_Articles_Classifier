Senior manager – sales and convention services, Katrina Lance, said: “The Asia-Pacific market represents 30% of the generated MICE leads for Dubai. This is a growing market, benefiting from the growing economics that various Asian countries have been experiencing.” \n\nThis year’s edition of IT&CMA 2015 will also see the debut of six Swiss entities: Arosa Kulm; Destination Davos Klosters; Geneva Tourism & Convention; Lausanne; Montreux Riviera – Lake Geneva; Lucerne Convention Bureau; and Zurich Tourism. \n\nIT&CMA 2015 will run at the Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld as always, between September 29 and October 1 this year. It runs alongside CTW Asia-Pacific.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T17:18:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
