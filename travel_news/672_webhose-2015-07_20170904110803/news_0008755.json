Photos Contributed Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nO UR eyes are peeled, torsos stretched over the railing of Gold Coast Adventures' 32-metre-long catamaran. My camera dangles from my neck over the Pacific Ocean. The deep blue surrounds us except for the coastline of South Stradbroke Island. \nWe're about 15 minutes into our maiden whale-watching voyage. The giants of the deep are yet to make an appearance, but even then there's so much to see - luxury yachts, turtles skimming the water's surface, dolphins racing the boat, even the island set of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean instalment (unfortunately we didn't spot Johnny Depp). Already at least seven people have succumbed to sea sickness. Our host Mary offers them \"show bags\" but says she doesn't want them back. \nThe boat's engine fires up a notch and we're headed due north. The captain's spotted one. A spurt of water shoots from the ocean's surface about 300m away. There she blows. \nAs we get closer the captain shuts down the engines so we don't scare them off. \nA juvenile humpback whips his tail in the air. He isn't afraid and swims ever so close to the boat. \nMinutes later we are spoilt for choice - where do you look? Photos Contributed \nAbout five pods of whales surround us - some dotted on the horizon, others fearlessly putting on an acrobatic display of breaches, pectoral waves and tail flukes slapping the surface in mesmerising displays of poise and power. \nThe unique markings on their tails are used by researchers to identify the mammals, much like a human fingerprint. \nThe captain explains the cove between Coolangatta and South Stradbroke Island acts as a protected playground for the 20,000 humpbacks on their annual migration north between June and late October. \nThe numbers are phenomenal when you think just 30 years ago there were only a few hundred humpbacks left in the wild. Geographic location makes the Gold Coast one of the best places to go whale watching - it offers the longest whale-watch season in Queensland. \nMy first close encounter with these giants will remain etched in my memory - if the Gold Coast is this good, I can't imagine what Hervey Bay has to offer. \n* The writer was a guest of QT Gold Coast and Gold Coast Adventures \nThere She Blows play and stay \nTwo night's accommodation at QT Gold Coast \nDaily breakfast for two at the Bazaar marketplace \nA half day whale-watching tour for two onboard Gold Coast Adventures, including morning tea and return transfers from the hotel to Marina Mirage. \nPrice: $297 per night (based on a minimum two-night stay) \nBook: http://www.qtgoldcoast.com.au or phone 07 55841200 \nThere She Blows is available until October 31, 2015.
