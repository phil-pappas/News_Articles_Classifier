The five-day, 1900-person Bermuda Bash cruise will depart on August 27, 2016, from the Baltimore Harbor to Kings Warf, Bermuda.\nWith the historic June 26th, 2015, Supreme Court ruling recognizing marriage equality as a fundamental right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we are at a pivotal point for LGBTQIA inclusion, alliance and understanding in our country.\nPride on the Sea cruises are intended to build trust, community and improve the working & social relationships through all ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations & identifications and the communities they represent through our program tracks and special events. The Bermuda Bash cruise is centered on the LGBTQIA community and a core set of values: personal responsibility, community responsibility, respect, and trust & consent. These are values that every staff person, cruise participant, company and organization involved supports and is carried all the way from planning through implementation and evaluation of our events and productions. The cruise will also highlight 6 tracks of programs which include: mind, body and soul, political empowerment and community development, professional and networking events, sass and flirt, entertainment and culture, as well as nightlife and themed events.\nStarting with a culture of inclusion, alliance and understanding, Pride on the Sea is currently seeking specific key community members, entertainers, affinity groups, companies and organizations that they feel embrace this culture about possible partnership opportunities with the Bermuda Bash cruise\n “Whether attending our events as a party vacation, a professional/community continuing education resource or a romantic honeymoon, there will truly be something for everyone at the Bermuda Bash, and that’s exactly our point. At Pride on the Sea we aim to create unique experiences that embrace all identities and passions of every person that steps foot in our events,” Howard N.
