By Kelly Egan \nWhen I found out that I would have to spend two weeks in Philadelphia for work, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I was in Philadelphia in middle school to check out the classics like the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, but I honestly didn’t know much about the city beyond the tourist stuff. My friends shared lists of restaurants I needed to check out, ice cream I needed to eat and places to go to grab a drink. \nSo I ate my heart out for two weeks in Philly. \nI hope you make it to Philadelphia to check out some of these amazing places to eat. By no means is this an exhaustive guide. This is the selection of restaurants that I enjoyed the most over the two weeks I spent in Philly. There are so many that were recommended to me that I just didn’t have time to check out. If you have a place that you think deserves to be on this list, let me, and everyone else, know in the comments! \nI think the best piece of advice I can give you if you’re traveling and exploring the food scene in a city is to ask the restaurant staff for recommendations. At every place I went to on this list, I started with the question, “What dishes on the menu are you really excited about right now?” Trust me, their recommendations didn’t disappoint! Zahav \nZahav was truly wonderful. It’s Israeli food, done exceptionally well. The best way to experience the food is with the tasting menu. It’s surprisingly affordable at only $45 and includes a smorgasbord of food. You get salatim (fresh, flavorful Israeli salads) with (incredible) hummus & laffa to start. Next, the choose your own adventure portion of the meal begins. You get two small mezze plates and one al ha’esh (grilled over coals) main. The food is fresh, flavorful and perfect for sharing with a group of friends. I had to make friends with the people sitting next to me and practically force them to help me eat it. I still had enough leftover to turn it into lunch the next day! \nZahav $$", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:08:02.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
