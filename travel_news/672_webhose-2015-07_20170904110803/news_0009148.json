With suspicions putting everyone from Sawney Bean to The Green Lady in the firing line, the question throughout August will be WHODUNNIT?!\nAfter years passing sentence on the folk of Auld Reekie, the infamous Judge Mental has fallen victim to the most terrible of crimes – was it an act of revenge for a hefty punishment or an act of unprovoked malice? Throughout the Festival the Edinburgh Dungeon will be calling on its visitors to help solve its Deadly Dungeon Murder Mystery.\nJoining the Secret Society of Scottish Scoundrels, visitors will be asked to use their best detection skills to find the guilty culprit from a host of the Dungeon’s most colourful characters during each unique evening performance. With a host of disreputable characters on the scene it’s a case of guilty until proven innocent for the likes of Tom Turnbull the Torturer and Ruby Red.\nAdding even more shock and suspense to the usual mix of cheeky humour and unforgettable storytelling, the Deadly Dungeon Murder Mystery is part of the attraction’s spectacular summer line-up that includes Where’s Jack – a chilling tale inspired by one of history’s most malicious characters, Jack the Ripper. Fleeing London to prevent capture, is it possible the shadowy figure arrived in Edinburgh to wreak havoc in Fleshmarket Close…indeed was it he who brought Judge Mental to his dark demise?\nSource:-Edinburgh dungeon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:14:53.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
