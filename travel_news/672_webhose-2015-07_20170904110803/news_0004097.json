The annual census has also been supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.\nThis year the annual dolphin census was integrated into Port Stephen’s first-ever Naturefest program in June, a festival created by dolphin-watch operators, Imagine Cruises, Moonshadow Cruises and Tamboi Queen Cruises and supported by d’Albora Marina Nelson Bay, Destination Port Stephens and Port Stephens Council to showcase the region’s natural scenery and wildlife in winter.\nMs Skelton thanked all the volunteers who helped make the census a success this year. “We all love our dolphins in Port Stephens and important initiatives like this help ensure the local population is abundant and healthy,” Ms Skelton said.\nDestination Port Stephens CEO, Janelle Gardner, said Port Stephens was famous for its dolphins and the census confirmed they would remain pivotal to the region’s appeal. “The census showed visitors can see a large number of dolphins in Port Stephens, which also boasts many koalas, kangaroos, varieties of birds and also whales in winter,” Ms Gardner said. “During the cooler months, our promotions have successfully highlighted this rich wildlife and our pristine scenery so that the market knows we offer so much more than amazing beaches.”\nSource:-Port Stephens\nTags: dolphin , Frank Future , Lisa Skelton , Marine Parks Association Education Coordinator , Port Stephens , Travel Destination News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:17:26.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
