Located on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, only 310 miles from Rome and 930 from Paris, this former state of Yugoslavia proved itself as an ideal territory for investment, since the country is on its way out from a transitional period, and is regarded as the leading country in the world when it comes to numbers of tourist visitation growth per year. \nThe complex has recently opened its door for the public, and you can take a look at available luxury residences with the view of the coastline here . When we say “open for public,” we are actually stretching out the term, because Dukleys Gardens is a gated community, with deluxe apartments and villas providing privacy and commodity at the same time. \nIn fact, if you are one of lucky residents, you can count on constant video surveillance, and access to the community is strictly regulated and only allowed to key-card holders, plus a state of the art smart home system is installed in every apartment. On the other hand, the Dukleys Gardens is located at the very center of the social scene, so you can enjoy not just in the view, but in the full access to marina, an outdoor pool, and your private coastline which stretches as far as 280 miles along the shore. For your everyday convenience, there is also a SPA center, a beauty salon, a beach bar, and even a kindergarten for the young ones. \nEncouraged by his success, and empowered by the local government, Neil Emilfarb announced the opening of the Dukleys hotel next year, so the Gardens will keep on growing. In fact, if you book a room for the next season, you can also arrive by your personal yacht and find a spot in the port of Dukleys marina, or if you don’t own a yacht, you can simply rent one. Whether if you are looking for a golf court, or some relaxation time on the sandy beaches of Montenegro, or even some excitement and good music , Dukleys Gardens will meet your terms and have you craving for more. \nSo come and find your personal paradise in Dukleys Gardens. You may find out that there is only little room left, but don’t worry, Neil Emifarab isn't planning on stopping the growth of his gardens any time soon. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T03:47:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
