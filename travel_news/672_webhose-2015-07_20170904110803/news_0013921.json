Our passengers wanted to see Aegean Odyssey in those areas and the likelihood is we’ll look at doing more with the UK.” \nHe added this could mean operating ex-UK departures in 2017, although he denied the ship would ever be based in the country for long. \n“It is not the kind of product where we would base the ship in the UK. It is not a market we’re looking to compete with and we’re not going to be going to the fjords or the Baltic Sea,” Dewing said. \nHe added the operator was looking to engage more with the trade having recruited 10 new members of staff in sales, marketing and product to join the 16-strong team currently working in the Oxford office. \nVoyages has also relaunched its agent website, complete with extra training, with those who complete it earning the opportunity to go on fam trips as well as additional commission payments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:16:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
