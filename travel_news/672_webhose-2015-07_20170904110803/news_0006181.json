It was expected that Samsung would be unveiling its next Galaxy smartphones – the much-rumoured Note 5 and the S6 Edge Plus – in September at IFA.\nBut an August reveal is now looking likely, and it’s not just smartphones under the spotlight. According to a Wall Street Journal report citing “people familiar with the matter”, Samsung could also be taking the covers off of its next-generation smartwatch, although there is a disclaimer that a “final decision still hasn’t been made.”\nThe Samsung Gear A, apparently labelled the Orbis internally , has been doing the rounds on the web rumour mill for the past few months, and is expected to shun Google’s Android Wear OS in favour of the Korean giant’s own Tizen platform.\nThe Samsung Gear A is likely to become official later this year (Samsung)\nThat much was all but officially confirmed back in April when Samsung released an SDK for “our next generation Gear device”.\n“This is our first time to include the Tizen Native APIs so now you can build both Web applications and Native applications for the Next Gear,” read the notes with the release.\nSamsung also spilled the beans on some of the software and hardware that will make up the next-gen smartwatch.\nThe round smartwatch will feature a rotating bezel that, like the Apple Watch’s digital crown, adds physical controls to a touchscreen setup. The SDK details how it can be programmed for a wide range of navigation options including scrolling, zooming and adjusting levels such as volumes and brightness.\nOn the spec-sheet front we’ve had a fair amount of details emerge both from official and unofficial means. The display – either a 1.18 or 1.56-inch Super AMOLED one depending on what reports you believe – has a 360 x 360 resolution.\nWith regards to sensors, there’s an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an heart-rate monitor. In terms of connectivity, there’s Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular all built in.\nA recent report by SamMobile stated the Gear A will be powered by a dual core Exynos 1.2GHz processor, a 450MHz GPU and 768MB of RAM. Exynos is Samsung’s own-brand ARM-based CPU architecture; as found in its smartphones and tablets.\nThe WSJ story suggests the smartwatch will boats “a limited form of Samsung’s payment software…allowing users to tap the watch to pay for public transit rides.” Samsung Pay was announced back in March and aims to take on its Apple namesake rival.\n“Samsung Pay will reinvent how people pay for goods and services and transform how they use their smartphones,” said Samsung CEO JK Shin. “The secure and simple payment process, coupled with our robust partner network, makes Samsung Pay a truly game-changing service that will bring value to consumers and our partners in the ecosystem.”\nPaul Lamkin is the editor-in-chief of Wareable .\nSign up for the Wareable newsletter to stay up to date with all things wearable tech.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-looks-to-bigger-galaxy-in-search-for-smartphone-star-1438057729", "http://eepurl.com/YiJaT", "http://developer.samsung.com/wearable/", "http://www.sammobile.com/2015/07/15/exclusive-samsung-gear-a-orbis-specifications/", "http://www.wareable.com/samsung/samsung-orbis-specs-release-date-wireless-charging-727"], "published": "2015-07-29T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T13:50:16.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
