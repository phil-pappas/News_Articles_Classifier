Today, with a new airport being constructed and an increasing number of international air routes, the Sichuan capital is even more closely connected to countries around the world. Plans for Chengdu’s new airport were released at the Airport Cities Asia Pacific Conference and Exhibition 2015. The new facility, 51 kilometres southeast of downtown Chengdu, will be larger. The new airport will make Chengdu the third city on the Chinese mainland to have a second airport, after Beijing and Shanghai. The Airport Cities Asia-Pacific 2015 event, which ran from May 13 to 15 in Chengdu, attracted nearly 600 delegates from across the world, including senior officials from airports, airlines, real estate and urban development companies and government departments. The delegates discussed how to promote co-operation between China and other Asia-Pacific countries to develop airport cities, as well as innovations in airport design and logistics. The first phase of the new airport will finish by 2018, with annual capacity to handle 40 million passengers and 700,000 tonnes of cargo According to the plans, the first phase of the new airport will finish by 2018, with annual capacity to handle 40 million passengers and 700,000 tonnes of cargo. The long-term goal is for the airport to handle 90 million passengers and 2 million tonnes of cargo annually. Highways, subways and intercity railways are also planned to link the new airport to downtown Chengdu and other parts of the city. “ Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is almost running at full capacity, but the passenger volume has kept rising in recent years. Experts expect the annual passenger volume in Chengdu to reach 62 million by 2020, so we need a larger airport,” said Pan Gang jun, general manager of the Sichuan Province Airport Group. Shuangliu airport saw 37.5 million passengers pass through last year, ranking it fifth among all 202 civil airports on the Chinese mainland. The figure is rising at the fastest speed on the Chinese mainland and is expected to reach more than 40 million this year. Pan said the new airport would mainly serve international routes, while Shuangliu airport would handle domestic flights. “Shuangliu airport is positioned as a regional aviation hub, while the new airport aims to become the fourth major national-level international hub, after Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Guangzhou in the south,” he said. Located in the core of Southwest China, the new airport could develop into the largest one on the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Yangtze River Economic Zone, and become China’s gateway to Europe, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East, Pan, said John Kasarda, chairman of the annual Airport Cities World Conference and Exhibition, said the construction and operation of the new airport would bring great development opportunities to Chengdu. He suggested that the city should make a clear division between the two airports and build rapid transit links between them. He also encouraged Chengdu to open more international routes to provide enough passenger and cargo volume. Chengdu already has the largest number of international routes in China’s central and western region. The 83 international routes connect it to cities around the world, including San Francisco, London, Frankfurt, Doha and Melbourne. Sichuan Airlines launched direct routes from Chengdu to Moscow on May 2, making it the first city in Southwest China to offer direct flights to the Russian capital. The city is favoured by many overseas airlines. British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines promoted their non-stop service between Chengdu and Europe in late May. United Airlines, which operates the only direct route between western China and the US, will increase the frequency of its nonstop Chengdu-San Francisco service from three times a week to daily from June 6 to September 1, according to the airline. “Chengdu is very important for us. The route has been meeting our expectations and we have received very positive feedback from our customers both in China and the US,” said Jake Cefolia, United’s vice-president of Atlantic and Pacific Sales. Chengdu was selected as the second Chinese city to host the World Route Development Forum in September 2016. It is seen as the leading annual event for the civil aviation sector.
