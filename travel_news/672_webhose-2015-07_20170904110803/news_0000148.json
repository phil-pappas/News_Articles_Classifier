Hull owner Aseem Allam has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the club he prevented from going into administration back in 2010 if his name change idea was rejected. The FA Council had already turned down an application last year, but Hull successfully appealed against that verdict, which led to a second hearing. Interestingly, the Telegraph has seen documents which show the majority of Premier and Football League owners and chairman supported Hull’s argument. The FA canvassed opinion from a cross-section of clubs as part of an investigation into Hull’s bid, but even though more than three quarters of those who were asked whether Hull should be allowed to change their name said they should, the FA appears to have ignored their advice. Aseem Allam has threatened to walk away from the club if their name is not changed Hull insisted the name change idea had been backed by the majority of the club’s supporters in a ballot of season-card holders back in 2014. A total of 2,565 of those eligible voted for the change, to 2,517 against. However, only 5874 of the club’s 15,033 season card holders responded, with 792 voting they were \"not too concerned and will continue to support the club either way\". An FA statement read: The FA Council has rejected Hull City’s application to change their playing name to Hull Tigers. “The Council’s decision – carried by a 69.9 per cent vote of its members – came after a recommendation from The FA’s Membership Committee. “The Council, which is made up of representatives from across football, fully considered the recommendation in reaching its decision.” Hull said they acknowledged the FA Council's decision. In a statement, they said: \"We always knew that following a change to the FA's policy, the chances of changing the name were slim but we also feel it is important to fight for what you believe in and we believe that being called Hull Tigers would be the best strategy for the future. \"We will be taking some time away from the club to consider our options and we will make no further comment until we have come to a conclusion.\" FA chairman Greg Dyke has admitted there is nothing stopping Hull from making another application, particularly if they offered more evidence of the supposed financial benefits the rebranding will bring, but Allam has vowed to sever ties with the club if his plan was rejected for a second time. Hull are heavily reliant on Allam’s financial support, particularly as they are still coming to terms with their relegation from the Premier League back in May.
