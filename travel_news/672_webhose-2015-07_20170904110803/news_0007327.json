Where are you from?”\nPerhaps our Canadian accents gave us away, or maybe it’s simply that you can’t stay a stranger for long in Gozo. But when the Maltese president and her husband take the time to stop and chat with us, their warm small-town welcome reminds me of our friendly Newfoundlanders back home.\nYou have to love that folksy “islanders” way of life.\nThe tiny sub-tropical nation of Malta is actually a collection of three lovely little islands. Gozo is the charming country cousin to dynamic, teeming Malta, with the cute island of Comino cuddled between in the dazzling-blue embrace of the Mediterranean.\n“There are only 5 km of sea between the islands of Malta and Gozo, but there’s a world of difference between the two,” says Brian Meliak of the Baron Group as he welcomes us to the lovely limestone farmhouse we have rented. Gozitan farmhouses are popular self-catering accommodations on this laid-back rural island where, like in Newfoundland, “many people still don’t lock their doors.”\nThe capital city of Victoria (also known as Rabat) sits in the centre of the island, but the heart of Gozo lives in its friendly locals, timeless villages, rugged countryside and stunning seashore.\nWe walk Gozo’s soaring scenic cliffs past weathered watchtowers, and share coastal paths with farmers and their nimble-footed goats. A stroll along golden beaches leads us past boathouses cleverly carved into limestone cliffs and secured with striking Crayola-coloured doors.\nPlaying in the Mediterranean’s bottomless blue waters or simply gazing through the natural arch of the Azure Window is delightful in Dwejra.\nAnd taste a traditional “ftira” from Maxokk Bakery just once and you’ll be back for more of this Gozitan specialty.\nAt first glance, a “Flira tal-Maxokk” looks like a pizza, but it’s a unique blend of potatoes and cheese loaded with fresh local flavours and baked to golden perfection in the bakery’s old brick oven. It’s worth the easy 20-minute ferry ride from Malta.\nEn route between Gozo and Malta, day-trippers stop off at pretty Comino to plunge into the famous Blue Lagoon and hike the easy 7-km path. The tiny island has one small seasonal hotel and a permanent population of just four people.\nThe Maltese island most of us picture is cosmopolitan Malta, with its popular cruise port, ancient temples, colourful fishing boats and those mega-rich Knights of St. John.\nHundreds of cruise ships sail into Grand Harbour each year, past the Three Cities, Fort St. Angelo and the towering 16th-century fortress-city of Valletta.\nDescribed as one of the most concentrated historic areas in the world, the World Heritage city of Valletta is preparing to celebrate being named the European Capital of Culture for 2018.\nExploring this small nation is like stepping into the pages of a history book come to life. Malta has some of the world’s oldest and best-preserved temples, built long before the Great Pyramids of Egypt were so much as a twinkle in Pharaoh’s eye.\nThe ancient coastal fishing village of Marsaxlokk serves up succulent seafood under the watchful eyes of the brightly coloured “luzzus” bobbing in the harbour. Each of the traditional Maltese fishing boats has a set of eyes painted on its prow to protect fishermen at sea.\nVisitors to Valletta should not be fooled by the simple façade of St. John’s Co-Cathedral. Malta’s magnificent Baroque church is jaw-droppingly gorgeous inside in all its gleaming gilded glory. Painted ceilings, marble floors and only the best works of art were good enough for the wealthy, powerful Order of the Knights of St. John.\nThe king of Spain gave Malta to the order in the 1500s. Their legacy also gave Malta one its best-known symbols — and favourite souvenirs — the iconic eight-pointed Maltese Cross.\nMedieval Mdina offers an opulent glimpse in the lifestyles of the rich and famous of the Maltese aristocracy. Many picturesque palaces and mansions in the walled “silent city” are now magnificent museums and restaurants.\nWant to dig deeper into Malta’s celebrated sites or see what’s behind some of those closed doors at private palazzos and historic homes?\n“Private Malta is a four-day luxury itinerary being offered by the Maltese family owned Corinthia Palace Hotel & Spa,” says creator Jim Dunn of the new VIP tour. “We want visitors to meet the locals in their homes; to visit, explore and dine in some of the island’s notable residences.”\nWe’re guessing the inside of the president’s home — San Anton Palace in the quiet town of Attard — isn’t on this exclusive tour, although some of its gardens are open to the public. But since the palace is just next door to the elegant Corinthia Hotel where we are staying, we wonder if they’d mind if we dropped in to say “Hi.”\nAfter all, it was President Preca’s husband who suggested to us: “You should move to Malta. It’s like paradise.”\nNEED TO KNOW\n— For more information on visiting Malta, see visitmalta.com and visitgozo.com .\n— Between May and September, the islands come alive with many village festas (feast days) and festivals with music and fireworks.\n— For details on San Anton Palace public gardens, Private Malta tours, and the Corinthia Palace Hotel & Spa, see corinthia.com .\n— Baron Group Holiday Homes are located throughout Gozo.
