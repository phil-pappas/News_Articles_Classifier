(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) The vegetables are coming on strong, the markets are overflowing and farm stands glow with the colors of summer produce. It’s time to pickle.\nA fermented pickle is the Other Pickle: not vinegar-based. Although fermentation is trendy and has been picking up speed for all its health benefits , I ferment foods because it makes them taste great. Fermentation uses microorganisms and “good,” lactic-acid bacteria naturally occurring in the air to turn vegetables into crunchy, tangy, welcome treats.\nMaking fermented pickles couldn’t be more straightforward, requiring only pristine produce, water and salt. A relatively short amount of time can perform the transformative magic.\n[Make the recipe: Deli-Style Fermented Sour Pickles ]\nHalf- and full-sour pickles, such as the ones served at classic New York delicatessens, are typically fermented. They make a great addition to any summer picnic and take only three days to go from cucumber to amazing. When you apply the same process to the components of a slaw, such as carrots and the much-maligned kohlrabi, your fellow picnickers will be treated to a whole new kind of zesty side dish.\nSelect vegetables for fermentation with care. Look for specimens with no bruising, soft spots or mold. Recently harvested cucumbers make for a crisper and more flavorful pickle. Kirby cucumbers are coming in now, benefiting from hot weather and consistent rains. They are plump, firm and sprightly, bright green and ready to be pickled. Kirbys have fewer seeds than so-called salad cukes and seedless (English) varieties and a more substantial skin, making them perfect for pickling. They remain crisp while absorbing the flavor of the brine.\nCucumber vines will continue to flower and fruit throughout the summer, but the early crop is heavy and gives a greater opportunity to find uniformly sized specimens. Why is that important? Because I like to pickle cucumbers whole and slice them just before serving, so I spend time hunting down right-size specimens to fit in the jars. (When I do end up with mixed sizes, I’ll plan to eat the smallest ones first, as they will brine the fastest, or I’ll cut the whole batch into spears or thick chips before brining.)\nAs the summer goes on, humidity, too much or too little rain and a variety of pests can take down a cucumber vine. So pickle now for no regrets later.\nFermented Spicy Gingered Carrot-Kohlrabi Slaw: a whole new kind of zesty side dish. (Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) [Make the recipe: Fermented Spicy Gingered Carrot-Kohlrabi Slaw ]\nOther things I’ve learned:\nChoose pristine produce. Vegetables with soft spots, bruises and other damage won’t ferment at the same pace as specimens that are firm, fresh and perfectly ripe.\nUse filtered, non-chlorinated water. Chlorine can interfere with the fermentation and the flavor of the pickle.\nPick the right salt. Use only kosher or sea salt; iodized (table) salt will turn ferments black and mushy.\nWeight for it. For a successful fermentation, the vegetables must remain completely submerged in the brine. I accomplish that in a few ways, including fitting another jar just inside the one filled with vegetables and brine; the fit should be snug enough not to allow air to escape yet just loose enough so that you can still remove the top jar. Fill that top jar with water, which will turn it into a weight that holds the vegetables down.\nVary the flavor profiles. I always make a few straight-up sours with nothing but salt and water. In other jars, I might add dill seed (dried) or fresh dill flowers; garlic scapes or whole, peeled garlic cloves; even sliced jalapeño or habanero peppers. Be bold and adventurous.\nAvoid a mushy pickle. Every cucumber carries an enzyme that kills crunch. Cut off a slim piece of the blossom end. If you can’t figure out which end that is, take a slice off both ends and call it a day. Some people add fresh (washed) grape leaves, oak leaves, horseradish leaves or leaves from a sour cherry tree, as the tannins therein will boost crunch.\nWatch the magic. Once filled and brined, the jars sit on the counter for a few days. It’s a fascinating transformation. The water turns cloudy as lactobacillus, a healthy, white, fluffy mold, forms. Small, lazy bubbles burble up. The pickles change color, too.\nIf you have preserving jars on hand, they’re handy to use. But any glass jar with a screw-on cap or a crock made specifically for fermenting will do. When you use a crock, make sure to use the same kind of weighting technique to keep the vegetables submerged. If your crock did not come with a weight, make one yourself by filling a zip-top bag with more of the salty brine. (Should the bag leak, the brine in your crock will not suffer.)\nAbout those bubbles: Be sure to loosen the jar caps once a day — this is called “burping” — to release CO 2 and ensure there won’t be a spillover.\nBarrow is the author of “ Mrs. Wheelbarrow’s Practical Pantry: Recipes and Techniques for Year-Round Preserving ” (W.W.
