Here are five factors for business owners to keep in mind... Plan, plan, plan Before you do anything else, says Andrew Subramaniam, SME partner at the chartered accountants HW Fisher & Company, “plan”. “Paying bills sporadically and without proper planning will stretch your cashflow unnecessarily. In extreme cases, failing to pay them on time, whether it’s rent or salaries, can quickly prove fatal to your business.” Mr Subramaniam says: “Regularly review how much you spend on your overheads, from rent to mobile phone contracts, check you're getting the best deal.” Also, time bill payments as carefully as you can so you know when money is going out. Shop around for banking Taking your time before accepting the first finance you can get can pay dividends. Jeremy Perkins is co-owner of cafe CoffeEvolution in Huddersfield. He says: “At one point we were paying astronomical bank charges, including percentages payable for money paid in.” Mr Perkins had to dig deep to find the information, however, “It was one of those occasions where the cunning bank kept schtum about a much better service for my business,” he laughs, “so always ask the question. We now pay a standard small fee that incorporates everything.” Work your credit controllers Keep your debtor days (the average number of days required for a company to receive payment from its customers for invoices issued) as low as you can. Early debtor receipts will reduce bank borrowing costs. It’s good business practice to collect payment from your customers as soon as you can (ideally within 45 days). Therefore a strong credit-control team or credit-control system is crucial. This includes “dealing with customer queries as quickly as possible”, says Neil Sevitt, head of SME services at chartered accountant and business adviser Baker Tilly, “because they won’t pay an invoice if there is a query on it.” Be flexible with your staff Owen Niblick runs Kumquat Computing, a website and app company offering Sitecore resources for large enterprises and digital agencies. He says: “By encouraging home working we've been able to double the development team without having to move to bigger offices, so we're saving on rent and all the associated costs. \"The company is also on an inclusive rent deal so gas and electric are included.” And if your staff need the space, do you need to pay for the building? Getting shiny, new office space can be one of the most thrilling things about running your own business, but do you really need it? Lucy Burnford, co-founder of car management website Motoriety.co.uk, says: “Don’t hire office space until absolutely necessary. If you need an address to portray yourselves in a professional way and direct correspondence to, there are numerous virtual office addresses you can register at for a very small fee. ​ Some will have hot-desk space or meeting rooms you can hire as and when required.” Moreover, mobile devices with wireless hot-spots and mobile printing solutions, such as HP ePrint mean you need never have to have a water cooler-based reality-TV chat again. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow Discover more tips and advice for SMEs: • How you can protect your business • What do micropayments mean for SMEs? • Online payment advice for SMEs • Urica: a quick fix for slow payments? • Top 10 cashflow tips for SMEs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T17:18:53.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
