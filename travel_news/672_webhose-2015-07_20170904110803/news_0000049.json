About Tripda Tripda is a genuine ride-sharing and carpooling platform for long-distance travel. Our mobile and web app are a marketplace matching drivers offering rides and passengers looking to go the same way. Drivers can offer empty seats in their cars on trips they are already making, and passengers can search and book seats on rides that are already going where they need to go. Both sides have plenty of information available on the platform to select the travel companions they'd like to ride with, they can read reviews that other travelers wrote, see other users' affiliation with any organization such as a college or a corporation, view their Facebook profile, check if they have any mutual friends or choose to communicate with them directly before the trip. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:13:04.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
