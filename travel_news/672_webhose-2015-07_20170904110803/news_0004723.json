Qantas is transferring its Sydney flights to Haneda International Airport, which benefits from being closer to central Tokyo, while also operating a daily A330 flight from Brisbane to the Japanese capital. \n\nJapan Airlines has daily services from Sydney to Narita International Airport, which is less attractive as a departure or arrivals point for travellers than Haneda. \n\nThe number of Australians travelling to Japan has surged in recent times, thanks to a weaker yen and the popularity of winter sports destinations such as Hokkaido.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T11:26:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
