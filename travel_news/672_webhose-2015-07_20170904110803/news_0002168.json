Unveiled in April 2002 , the American Traffic Safety Services Foundation's National Work Zone Memorial and its \"Respect and Remembrance: Reflections of Life on the Road\" program is a living tribute to the memory of lives lost in work zones. The memorial is updated each year and travels to communities cross-country, year-round to raise public awareness of the need to respect and stay safe in America's roadway work zones. \"Having the National Work Zone Memorial stop in Harrisburg , Philadelphia and Pittsburgh is a great honor, but also very sobering because you can see the people who have lost their lives during work to improve our transportation system,\" said PennDOT Secretary Leslie S. Richards . \"As drivers we must realize that work on our roadways is essential to keep people and commerce flowing, and as residents of the state it is our responsibility to obey work zone laws to keep these workers safe from harm.\" The event also featured PennDOT's traveling worker's memorial in the lobby of the Keystone Building in Harrisburg . The memorial includes 85 posts topped by hard hats and draped in safety vests. Each post represents a PennDOT employee who died in the line of duty since 1970. Speakers at the event also emphasized that work-zone safety doesn't just affect workers, but also the traveling public. PennDOT data shows that 24 people were killed in work-zone crashes in 2014, eight more than in 2013. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:51:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
