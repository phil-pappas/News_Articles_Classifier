An experienced marketer, Amy will be responsible for developing strategic marketing plans and proactively identifying and developing new business opportunities. She will be striving to gain a deeper understanding of the corporate accommodation needs of House of Fisher clients, their drivers and precisely what they value. The aim will be to ensure House of Fisher can continue to evolve and find new ways to deliver perfectly tailored accommodation solutions. Previously Amy spent 6 years as UK Marketing Manager for Heraeus Kulzer before joining Quadriga, provider of digital content and IT software technology within the hospitality sector. Other recent key team changes include the promotion of Aneal Sadiq to Head of Sales and appointment of Joe Sweeny as Area Sales Manager. By investing in Youth Enterprise schemes, House of Fisher has been able to simultaneously increase the opportunities of young people living within the local community. A recent success story is Zoe Wyatt; now a fully-fledged member of the HoF Reservations and Administrative teams, having gained an NVQ after excelling in her apprenticeship. One of the main stewards and drivers behind House of Fisher’s expansion plans has been the experienced Business Development Manager, Robert Brown. With a receptive nature to client demand, Robert Brown is very much looking to the future with House of Fisher, by actively seeking new business locations to accommodate House of Fisher’s apart-hotel product. With exciting ventures already in the pipeline, House of Fisher’s strong market advantage and dynamic new team place the provider in a spotlight position within the regional accommodation sector. As Chief Executive John Fisher affirms, “These appointments further strengthen our team to drive the business forward and continue to develop House of Fisher as the premier Serviced Apartment provider in the region. With our greater focus on our new apart-hotel style developments, guests can expect sophisticated and spacious apartments with hotel facilities and service.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T14:25:00.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
