Here are six top choices for a stopover. PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Fri, Jul 31, 2015 GETTY The view over lake Lucerne, Switzerland \nSwitzerland \nLakeside Lucerne is classic Switzerland and can be experienced to the full with a two-night pre or post-Rhine Discovery cruise add-on with Viking Cruises (vikingcruises.co.uk). \nA walking tour takes in the Chapel Bridge across the Reuss River, the oldest covered wooden bridge in Europe. The second day is free but there are many options, not least a trip on a paddlewheel steamer to one of the other resorts that dot the lake. \nThere are mountains, too, with lifts taking you up Mt Pilatus and Mt Titlis; walk down for a fantastic mix of scenery and fresh air. The cruise sails links Amsterdam and Basel, with calls at Cologne and Strasbourg. \nIndia \nAmer Fort, a hilltop sandstone edifice, elephants laden with tourists heading for the top, is as far from a river cruise as you can get. It is just outside Jaipur, the Pink City, on India's Golden Triangle. \nJaipur is India at its best, an exhilarating rush of people and traffic, although the two-night stop on the 14-day India's Golden Triangle and the Sacred Ganges cruise/tour from Uniworld in conjunction with Titan Travel (titantravel.co.uk/uniworld) lets you retreat to the Oberoi Rajvilas resort, in traditional ornate pink style with 32 acres of gardens and 18th-century Shiva temple - relax to the chanting of a Hindu priest and with morning yoga. After a city tour you head to Kolkata for a seven-night Ganges cruise. GETTY Bask in the beauty of New Orleans' French Quarter An exhilarating rush of people and traffic \nUSA \nNew Orleans is a city where the simple things are the best: listening to music, drinking bourbon and wandering the streets of the French Quarter. Taking American Queen, the world's largest paddlewheeler, down the Mississippi from Memphis is an extraordinary experience, one that wouldn't come to a satisfactory conclusion without a couple of nights in the sultry Big Easy. \nThe eight-night holiday from Light Blue Travel (lightbluetravel.co.uk) starts with a night in Memphis. There's great cuisine, from rich French dishes to alligator hotdogs at the colourful Dat Dog chain, great bars (try the revolving Carousel in the Moteleone Hotel) and great sights- ride the oldest continuously operated streetcar in the world. \nPortugal \nLisbon is a cultured, sun-drenched city and starting a Douro cruise with three included nights here is perfect. Stroll along the River Tagus to the Belem Tower, a 16th-century fortress, then cross the road to the fabulous Jeronimos Monastery, where carved seafaring motifs sit side by side with stone pineapples and other celebrations of discovery. This visit, on trips from Scenic Tours (scenictours.co.uk), includes a free day to explore the sophisticated shopping streets, climb the city centre hill to see the cathedral and other sights, or even catch a train to one of the beaches as the river nears the sea. GETTY Stroll across the Charles Bridge to the famous Prague Castle \nCambodia \nSiem Reap in Cambodia is an entrancing mix of Khmer and French architecture which you can explore in a two-night stay during an APT (aptouring.co.uk) Vietnam and Cambodia cruise. The Sofitel Angkor Phokeethra with gardens, spa and pool is close to the Angkor temples, Siem Reap River and old market. There's a visit to Unesco-listed Angkor Archaeological Park and a champagne sunrise at Angkor Wat. There's also the choice between a visit to Wat Preah Prom Rath for a Buddhish blessing, visiting the Artisans d'Angkor workshops, a traditional dance class, quad bike adventure, elephant safari, bicycle tour, cooking class or a spa visit. There's also two nights in Ho Chi Minh City and the seven-night cruise. \nCzech Republic \nPrague, with its medieval heart, is old Europe. The cobbled passageways, the rugged towers and little shops are all part of a Unesco-protected centre, including Charles Bridge from 1402. A three-night stay, before a week's Danube cruise from Emerald Waterways (emeraldwaterways.co.uk) between Nuremberg and Budapest includes a walking tour plus coach to the 1,000-year-old Prague Castle area to watch the changing of the guard before a tour of gems such as Hradcany \nCastle, the Old Kings Palace and St. George's Monastery. There's also an evening of entertainment in a traditional tavern. The cruise, on one of Emerald's new ships - which include an indoor pool that transforms into a cinema by night - visits Vienna and the Slovakian capital, Bratislava.
