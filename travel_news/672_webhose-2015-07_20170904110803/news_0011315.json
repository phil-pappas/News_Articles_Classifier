Mick Jagger said: “We’ve been thinking about it for quite a long time but wanted it to be just right and on a large scale just like planning our touring concert productions. I think right now, it’s an interesting time to do it.” \nKeith Richards added: “While this is about The Rolling Stones, it’s not necessarily just about the members of the band. \n“It’s also about all the paraphernalia and technology associated with a band like us, as well as the instruments that have passed through our hands over the years that will make the exhibition really interesting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:25:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
