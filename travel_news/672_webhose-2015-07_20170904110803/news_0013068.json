The Meetings Show will move to Olympia Grand from 14-16 June, 2016. The move means the show will be unified in a single more cohesive environment providing even more business opportunities for both visitors and exhibitors. The move has become necessary following an almost 30% increase in floor space since the Show’s debut in 2013. \nThe Association Meetings Conference, which has seen a 49% growth since 2014, will move in line with the new dates to 13 June, 2016. “This week’s show is bigger than 2014 in so many ways and we look forward to welcoming meetings professionals from around the globe over the course of the next three days,” comments The Meetings Show’s Event Director, Steve Knight. “We have more than 600 exhibitors, a 20% increase in hosted buyers and more than 12,000 preschedule appointments. The industry has voted with its feet – the hosted buyer model is clearly wanted by both the supply and demand side of the industry and the changes for 2016 will ensure the needs of the industry are met. As one of London’s most iconic venues, Olympia Grand is the perfect location for the show – it offers more space and plenty of room to grow as we continue to increase our industry presence.” Visitors can still register to attend the 2015 show taking place until Thursday 9th July via www.themeetingsshow.com or onsite at Olympia London. Highlights include corporate, healthcare, PA, meetings design and technology education streams as well as extensive networking and new business opportunities.
