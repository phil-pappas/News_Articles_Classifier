The Seattle Greenlaker reports that the Frederick A. McDonald house, located at 5722 E. Green Lake Way N., is listed for $2.4 million.\nBuilt in 1890, the home has changed hands several times and undergone extensive renovations but still retains all the original stained glass windows, hardwood staircase, solid oak doors and millwork. The seven-bedroom, 7.75-bathroom home features a detached studio that would make an excellent mother-in-law suite, a wet bar and a second kitchen.\nAccording to \"Seattle's Green Lake\" by Brittany Wright, McDonald was a judge before being elected to the state Legislature in 1898. He eventually became the minority floor leader. He had close ties to William D. Wood , a key player in the development of Green Lake and Seattle's mayor from April 1896 to July 1897. He was also associated with Edward C. Kilbourne, the founder of the Seattle public electricity system.\nMcDonald was a supportive partner to both Wood and Kilbourne in developing the Green Lake trolley line. Kilbourne was one of the founders of Fremont and worked with Wood to extend his streetcar line from Fremont to Green Lake in 1891.\nYou can see the full listing here.
