BenchMade Modern offers eight collections, ranging from sleek and minimal to comfy-cozy, all customizable by the inch and available in 45 color choices. To ensure a perfect fit, they can send customers a full-size printout of their sofa with markings on either end. Standard manufacturing at the BenchMade Modern-owned and operated factory (seven days) and delivery is free, but customers can opt to have the manufacturing time expedited to 24 hours (for an additional fee between $100-400 ). BenchMade Modern has developed a proprietary tracking system that lets customers follow their furniture along its journey. With a tracking device in each piece, customers see their order move through manufacturing and then travel to its ultimate destination along a map. The online system will be available by the end of July. Serial entrepreneur and furniture industry veteran Edgar Blazona founded BenchMade Modern. The self-taught furniture designer also founded TrueModern, a national furniture wholesale company; and Modular Dwellings, the first modern prefab backyard structure company that made its building plans available to DIYers through ReadyMade magazine. The company is backed by angel investors including Jason Calacanis , the co-founder of Weblogs, Inc (sold to AOL), the influential LAUNCH Fund & Conferences, and an early angel investor in over 60 technology startups. \"BenchMade Modern is exactly the type of category-changing startup we like to be the first investor in,\" he says. \"Being able to house a furniture store in a space that is less than 1,000 square feet, while providing a down-to-the-inch custom sofa is just amazing -- let alone for half the price of existing options.\" Other investors include husband-and-wife entrepreneurial team Michael and Xochi Birch , founders of several startups (most notably UK-based online social networking site Bebo, and San Francisco -based members club The Battery); and Ted Rheingold , COO of InVenture Capital Corp, founder/CEO of Dogster, Inc., and advisor to several mission-driven startups. BenchMade Modern will open hybrid micro-shops across the US within the next 18 months. The first store will open by the end of this year in the San Francisco Bay Area .
