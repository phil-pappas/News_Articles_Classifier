(Shutterstock) \nWant those fluttery, Barbie-like lashes? Why rely on troublesome extension or harmful chemicals when you can go natural? Here are easy ways: \n1 Olive Oil: \nIt is rich in the required vitamins and minerals. Dip a cotton swab in some olive oil and apply it gently on the eyelashes every night before hitting the bed. \n2 Castor Oil and Vitamin E potion: \nCastor oil is thick in density, so mix it with a light oil like Vitamin-E, and then apply for a smoother application. It boosts blood circulation within the hair follicles and helps in growth. \n3 Green Tea: It contains caffeine and flavonoids which help in strengthening your eye lashes.They also boost new growth too. Soak a cotton ball in freshly steeped green tea and gently swipe it on your lashes. \n4 Lemon peels soaked in olive oil: Soak dried lemon peels in olive oil for 4-5 days. Applying this oil infused with the goodness of vitamin-C makes lashes long and strong. \n5 Wipe away makeup: Wash it off or use a mild wet wipe. Soaked in toners, they come in variants like aloe vera, rose and eucalyptus. \nInputs by beauty expert Bharti Taneja Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:15:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
