And for all its fandom and overexposure, the fabled theme park is still full of secrets. \nOf course, we're talking about Easter eggs. \nEaster eggs are those hidden treasures and blasts from the past that are peppered throughout rides and attractions. \nTarzan's Treehouse in Adventureland has a phonograph that quietly plays the 'Swisskapolka,' the theme song of the old Swiss Family Treehouse that stood before it. \nAlso in Tarzan's Treehouse, someone snuck in Mrs. Potts and Chip from 'Beauty and the Beast.' \nYou'll notice that every popcorn turner throughout the park features a different character -- and they change by season. Pictured below is the Rocketeer at a Tomorrowland popcorn stand. Oogie Boogie cranks the popcorn turner near the Haunted Mansion at Halloween, and Santa turns the kernels on Main Street around the holidays. \nFYI, if the popcorn is too overpriced, the plants at Tomorrowland are edible. According to Disney, 'the visionary landscaping doubles as a potential farm, projecting an ecologically astute future where humanity makes the most of its resources.' \nThe cryptic writing on the walls of Adventureland's Indiana Jones & the Temple of the Forbidden Eye can actually be decoded -- if you have a decoder card from 1995 when the attraction debuted. People are actually selling the vintage decoder cards on Ebay. \nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh attraction in Critter Country replaced the Country Bear Jamboree in 2003. But if you look behind as you enter the Honey Heaven room, you'll see Max, Buff, and Melvin, all characters from the former attraction. \nLook on top of the Eiffel Tower in the It's a Small World After All ride in Fantasyland and you'll see a poncho-wearing doll dedicated to the attraction's designer, Mary Blair. Known for her modern style and use of colour, Walt asked Blair to design the ride for the New York World's Fair. It made its Disneyland debut in 1966, and we've had the song stuck in our heads ever since. \nIf you stand in front of Snow White's Scary Adventure in Fantasyland long enough, you'll see the curtains part as the Evil Queen peers down \nThe names on Main Street's windows aren't random -- they're people who were important to the Disney company. As reported by Mental Floss, Imagineer Marty Sklar says you must meet three requirements to earn a window: you have to be retired; you have to achieve the highest level of service, respect, and achievement; and park management and Walt Disney Imagineering have to agree on the who, what, and where of each window. \nSnow White is always singing, and if you listen into the Wishing Well in Snow White Grotto in Fantasyland, you'll hear her echoes. If you get lost, ask one of the seven dwarfs to direct you to the Wishing Well. \nThe '77' numbers you see all over Space Mountain are a reminder of the attraction's 1977 open date. \nThe Haunted Mansion's lawn in New Orleans Square is filled with tombstones engraved with the names of Disney Imagineers who helped bring the Mansion to life. \nFamed actress and singer Julie Andrews has her own horse on the King Arthur Carrousel in Fantasyland named Jingles. Each horse is unique, but Jingles is the most decorated - and she's covered in bells. Walt Disney bought The Carrousel in Toronto and replaced other animals with horses, because who wants to ride deer when you can ride a majestic steed? \nThe clicking sound in the Telegraph Cable Office at the New Orleans Square Station is Walt Disney's paraphrased opening day speech in Morse code. The clicks say, 'To all who come to Disneyland, welcome. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savour the challenge and promise of the future.' \nThe golden W and R on the Dream Suite balcony in New Orleans Square are Walt and Roy Disney's initials. With a balcony that elegant, we can only imagine what the suite looks like. \nThat bespectacled jack o'lantern in Goofy's Garden in Toontown honours former Disneyland president Jack Lindquist. Lindquist dedicated 38 years of his life to Disney and retired on Mickey Mouse's 65th birthday on November 18th, 1993. Naturally, he earned himself a window on Main Street: 'J.B. Lindquist, Honorary Mayor of Disneyland.' \nYou'll notice quite a few ravens throughout The Haunted Mansion. The bird was originally cast as the attraction's narrator, until the 'Ghost Host' stole the role. The bird is also a nod to Edgar Allen Poe. Quoth the Raven, nevermore. 1 of 17 « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nThey're like candy for Disney superfans. \nOften Disneyland Easter eggs are relics of old rides where new ones have sprung up — but make no mistake, every \"coincidence\" is intentional. \nThe park prides itself on hiding Easter eggs in plain sight. \nScroll through the gallery above to see 17 of Disneyland's coolest Easter eggs. \nBusiness Insider", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T04:19:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
