In all, there are about a dozen ways to go, plus a very good ceviche on weekends. \n1090 Price St., Pismo Beach, (805) 295-6660. Lunch and dinner daily. \nKanpai Sushi: Many locals swear by this sushi restaurant, which opened in early 2014 in Pismo Beach. Best bet is to order the premium omakase menu featuring the chef’s choice of eight pieces of premium nigiri for $32, which includes raw shrimp on barely warm rice accompanied by its fried head. Diners can also order a la carte, and there’s a full array of rolls and Japanese specialties, including gyoza ($7-$8), chicken teriyaki ($13) and sukiyaki ($16). \n2665 Shell Beach Road, Pismo Beach; (805) 295-6636. Dinner Tuesday-Sunday. \nWillow: If you’re heading to Nipomo, then this new market and restaurant is a top option. You can pick up wine and picnic supplies in the market, or head outside to eat on the expansive patio. At lunch, go for the wedge salad, three chunks of lettuce and generous piles of crisp bacon, tomato and blue cheese dressing ($11); a burger with beer-braised mushrooms with fries ($14); or beer-battered fish and chips ($16). At dinner the menu is expanded with a few pastas and a similar array of sandwiches and a separate pizza menu. \n1050 Willow Road, Nipomo; (805) 929-0322. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. \nRobert’s: This second outpost of the original restaurant in Paso Robles offers one of the most refined experiences in the region with tablecloths and fully upholstered chairs. It’s a peaceful place for dinner or lunch, where you’ll find a respectable fish and chips ($13), a Reuben sandwich ($14); and grilled coho salmon salad ($15). The extensive menu includes a dozen main courses ($21-$36) and as many appetizers at dinner, and the execution can be hit or miss. \n303 Branch St., Arroyo Grande; (805) 574-1720. Lunch and dinner daily. Reservations and credit cards accepted. \nMason Bar: Next door to Robert’s this bar/restaurant opened this spring and has a rustic, brash edge with Mason jars suspended from plumbing pipes over the bar. While you can get food here — including a grilled cheese sandwich ($12), lobster corn dog ($14), green enchiladas ($14) and a daily changing “chef’s burger” (price varies) — the real draw is the cocktails and the 25 beers on tap. There are at least a dozen barrel-aged spirits and cocktails that are worth checking out. \n307 E. Branch St., Arroyo Grande; (805) 202-8918. Dinner from 4 p.m. Monday-Friday; and open continuously 11:30 a.m.-10 p.m. Friday-Sunday (bar open until 1 a.m.). \nHaymarket: Opened by the owners of Le Cheval hotel next door, this is the perfect place to pick up picnic supplies. There are three picnic baskets ($20 a person). The Standard includes a choice of sandwiches, pasta salad, fresh fruit, brownies and a bottle of water. You can also put down a deposit and rent the insulated basket for the day. This is also an excellent place for breakfast where they make crepes to order and filled with such things as ham and cheese ($9), and breakfast quesadillas ($7.95). You order and then head to the tree-shaded patio. It also has excellent sandwiches ($10) at lunch. \n840 11th St., Paso Robles, (805) 237-1055. Open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesday-Sunday. \nFish Gaucho: This Mexican restaurant opened a little more than a year ago with a stylish decor and a menu that is inspired by the cuisine of Baja. On warm days, the margaritas shout for attention as do the fresh daily-changing ceviche ($12) and other raw seafood offerings. On cooler days there’s an excellent pork posole ($7/$13) and the lobster enchiladas ($27) and chicken poblano enchiladas ($19) beckon anytime. The restaurant features more than 140 Tequilas and mezcal, so forget the wine flight and go for a spirits tasting. \n1244 Park St., Paso Robles, (805) 239-3333. Open for dinner from 3 p.m. daily. Lunch Friday-Sunday. \nNext Door Bistro: This tiny cafe adjoining the Di Raimondo’s cheese shop offers some surprisingly good food, including fresh salads and excellent soups that change daily ($3/$7). There’s always a ploughman’s lunch ($15) and a “picnic” lunch with a daily-changing selection of cheese and charcuterie. I still remember the vivid flavors in the braised turkey sandwich ($14) with big chunks of meat, walnut pesto, a thick slather of buttermilk blue aioli and Brussels sprout slaw. The restaurant is vegetarian friendly, so you can also get roasted tofu with romesco, pickled onions and local greens ($11). \n822 13th St., Paso Robles; (805) 591-7136.
