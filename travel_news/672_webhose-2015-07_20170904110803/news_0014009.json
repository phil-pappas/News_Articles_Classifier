Off we'd go for a week’s vacation, or longer, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. As we have matured and become empty nesters, we have moved from tent camping to classic teardrop trailer camping. And, we are soon to move “up the line” in classic trailers, when we finish rehab on a 1964 Serro Scotty Sportsman trailer. We have owned two tiny trailers; our first was a cute little reproduction Kit Kamper, popular after World War II and one of the more frequent teardrop trailer styles seen today. The Kit was built on a platform of 4-by-8-foot plywood sheets; hence, 4-feet wide, 4-feet tall and 8-feet long, with a 6-foot sleeping compartment and a rear galley for camping storage. Several years ago, we decided to up-size, and bought a slightly larger 1964 Serro Scotty Sportsman trailer, still teardrop in style and needing a complete rebuild. This larger retro trailer offers a dinette, sleeps three to four people, has an interior sink, two-burner stove and stand-up room for someone 5-foot 8-inches or shorter — which certainly fits my wife. And, this smaller classic will still fit in a standard garage (barely), important if you live in a neighborhood with a homeowner’s association. Procrastinating on the rebuild of the larger Scotty (now wedged in our garage), I purchased (through eBay) a beautiful reproduction 1958 Serro Scotty Sportsman Jr. teardrop, built in 2011. We have toured extensively with it, including two trips cross country, trips up the California, Oregon and Washington coasts to Vancouver, British Columbia, and assorted other western trips to national parks, including Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Pinnacles and Glacier. Vintage teardrop trailers have a number of advantages. They are small and lightweight (about 800 pounds), so a small car can tow it and deliver good gas mileage (we tow ours with a Ford Focus 5-speed manual transmission and get 26 MPG). They fit in your garage, the smallest campsites and vintage trailers are always the “talk of the campground.\" Stepping up to mid-size classic trailers (1,000 to about 2,500 pounds) offers scores of options. From Scotty's, Lil Loafers, Little Caesars to larger Shastas, Airstreams, Kenskills, Boles and the like, a wide variety of lengths, weights, floorplans and luxurious appointments await the discriminating buyer. Since they are larger, they offer more interior space and many more amenities — the trade-offs are they weigh more, reducing your towing gas mileage (you will need a more powerful tow vehicle) and you have to store them somewhere. We take special delight in pulling up beside giant diesel pickups, pulling 35-foot long fifth-wheels (and getting about 8 MPG), realizing we are about as comfortable as they are. We also equipped both our trailers with a rear bike carrier, so we can load two to three bikes on back. With bedding already made up, camp gear loaded, it's a simple matter to pack a cooler and clothes, hook up and away we go. (Homage to Jackie Gleason there.) We recently attended a classic trailer rally near Lake Tahoe. There we toured almost 40 classics, many of them wonderfully redone from the original. Typical was a 1955 Little Caesar, weighing just 1,400 pounds. Owners Steve and Patty Elliot of Shingle Springs noted “we paid only a few hundred dollars, invested $4,000 and considerable time in the rehab, from the frame up”. They also have a 65 Scotty and have rebuilt two teardrops and an Aristocrat. A larger classic that needed only a bit of work was a comfortable 1962 Kenskill. Owners Jenny and Mel Davis, Grass Valley paid just $800, installed a new refrigerator and $1,000 in parts and fixed some water damage in the front window area. Bob Hughes of Camino displayed his 1957 Corvette trailer on its maiden voyage. He paid $600 and spent two years doing a total rebuild. He extended the frame, refinished the windows and put about $7,000 into the rebuild, including a beautiful blue and white paint job. And, we spied an import from Germany, a tiny 1989 Ariba Puck, weighing only 700 pounds, with queen-size bed, tiny kitchen in front and towed by a classic Volkswagen Westfalia. With a pop-up roof, for six-foot plus headroom, it drew rave reviews (American-made 1970’s Hunter Compact classics offer similar style with pop-up roofs). Rebuilding a classic trailer can range from $1,000 to $10,000, or, you can choose to buy one that an owner has already rebuilt or upgraded. Prices for a fully rebuilt midsized classic can range from about $7,500 to $15,000. Nicely, the true classics are actually good investments and can usually be sold years later for as much, or more, than you paid for them. The marketplace for any of these is both Craigslist and eBay (search for tear drop, teardrop and vintage campers). However, beware if you find a trailer that has water damage or dry rot, the damage is usually many times greater than can easily be seen from the exterior. You can also find, on the web, varied companies that rent teardrops or old classics for a few days or a week. Try one out, you may become hooked on the comfort afforded and hard-sided security, vs. tent-camping. For more information: A variety of classic trailer websites offer insights into buying or rebuilding, including Tin Can Tourists, tincantourists.com, Shasta Trailers, vintageshasta.net and Serro Scotty trailers, nationalserroscotty.org.
