Being in Las Vegas, even at 107 degrees, must be cooling relief. Zen Master in Sin City.\n\"We got a very good young player too,\" the tall, spindly Lord of the Knicks said.\nJackson could have had Mudiay, the 6-foot-5 wunderkind. The Knickknacks possessed the fourth overall pick in the NBA draft. Mudiay had worked out for the team and said afterward he thought Jackson could help make him a star. Carmelo Anthony, once upon a time a Nuggets wonder kid himself, wanted somebody to hand him the ball (even more often), and Mudiay would have been that caddie. Metropolitan Manhattan drooled over Mudiay.\nJackson selected tall, spindly Kristaps Porzingis, and The New York Por' Authority was shocked.\nJackson and I are talking. Anthony and Jackson are not.\nEM slipped to Anthony's jersey number (7), and the Nuggets were flabbergasted. Luck be a Mudiay.\nAdvertisement VIPs have flocked to the desert to see Mudiay and other top draft choices — Towns, Russell, Cauley-Stein, Okafor et al. Chris Paul is hosting a tournament this weekend. Pingpong tournament. NBA veterans are heading off the Strip to watch the NBA Boyz To Men at the arena. Rosters have plenty of Elvis impersonators, but The King was courtside. Le Bron James arrived to hang out Friday.\nSummer league basketball is the in thing now for the NBA, with 23 teams representing league cities and one other composed of Developmental League players. (Think pro basketball's version of the Maui Invitational.)\nAnd Denver's Own Emmanuel Mudiay has been getting more than his share of attention.\nThe Knicks and the Kings must be cringing. Mudiay is a young amalgamation of Chauncey Billups and Allen Iverson (who both played for the Nuggets, and were traded for each other). He has the quick step and paint attraction of A.I., and the height and heart of Mr. Big Shot.\nMudiay is a rock 'n' roll, pick-and-roll, attack-mode master blaster. He accelerates to, and then under, the basket and flips the ball out beyond the 3-point arc for a sweet assist.\nEmmanual Mudiay smiles as he holds his new Nuggets jersey after a press conference June 26, 2015 at the Pepsi Center. ( Callaghan O'Hare, The Denver Post ) He's missing only a spring-loaded jump shot (or several). Magic Johnson and Julius Erving learned how to shoot in the pros.\nMudiay is not missing a beat, though, in adjusting from Texas high school basketball to the Chinese Basketball Association to the NBA summer league. He has averaged 12 points, 5.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.2 steals in Las Vegas. Not great, but a beginning. There's praise, not criticism.\nEmmanuel is not like The Other Guy — Dr. Jekyll-Mr. DUI, who may have to play point guard somewhere else this year with a ball-and-a-chain or an alcohol monitor to slow him down on the court. Mudiay already is more of a leader than Ty Loathsome. Emmanuel is playing the big room, while Ty is only a clown in a lounge act.\nNew Nuggets coach Mike Malone already loves Kid Nug. They have been spending nights watching film, not sitting at a blackjack table. Emmanuel asks about Paul and James. Now and in Vegas he can ask those two about themselves. Job training.\nAfter winning their first three games of the Vegas summer league, the Nuggets dropped one, then dropped into the consolation round. Friday night, the gathering at the smaller Cox Pavilion groaned when Mudiay was not in the starting lineup or even in uniform. The Nuggets decided they had seen enough and were not going to risk him further.\nBut Mudiay still showed he has a sense of team and his country's history with a tribute to both. The most famous player from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and one of the most famous players ever for the Nuggets, was Dikembe Mutombo.\nMudiay wore a Mutombo Nuggets throwback jersey. Perhaps he'll devise his own version of the finger wag.\nEmm&M is his act from Las Vegas to Denver.\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or twitter.com/woodypaige", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/woodypaige", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0702/20150702__emmanuel-mudiay~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:43:10.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
