They also gave out blankets, shaving kits, packets of nuts, socks, and eye shades, donated by Etihad Airways Procurement and Supply Management and Guest Experience departments, to the 10,000 workers. \nThe charity Iftar was organised in cooperation with the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC) and Hirmas Real Estate who assisted with approvals and event logistics. Khaled Almehairbi, Etihad Airways Senior Vice President Government and Aero-political Affairs and the Sports and Social Committee Chairman, said: “Through our Sports and Social Committee, we conduct various initiatives during the year to support humanitarian and charitable causes, while fostering an environment of engagement and inclusion among our staff, partner airlines and the local community. \n“Once again, the generous contributions of our employees helped us organise a successful charity Iftar for workers, making the Holy month of Ramadan a remarkable experience for all, and importantly, engaging the workers community in our initiatives.” \nDuring the holy month of Ramadan, the Sports and Social Committee implemented several sports and community initiatives which raised more than AED 280,000 to support charitable causes both in the United Arab Emirates and worldwide. \nSport initiatives included a Ramadan Charity Football Tournament, and tennis and table tennis open days. Other charity events were organised under the theme of ‘Share your blessings this Ramadan’ and comprised a Ramadan garage sale at Etihad Airways Head Quarters, and a visit to Sheikh Khalifa Medical Centre to put a smile on the faces of children with severe disabilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:12:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
