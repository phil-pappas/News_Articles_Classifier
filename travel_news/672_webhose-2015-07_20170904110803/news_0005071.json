The Glasgow-headquartered firm cited problems in Greece and Tunisia as well as a contractual dispute. \nThe firm, which owns a number of travel agents and is planning to open a resort on the Greek island of Crete, said results would “not meet current market expectations” but would be in line with the previous year. \n“As these items are all one-off, we do not believe they will impact upon trading in the financial year ending 31 October 2016 and accordingly we believe that market expectations for this period remain valid,” Minoan said. \nThe current fiscal crisis in Greece has led to a delay in the final sign-off for the group’s long-awaited Crete project. Minoan however is hopeful that the prospective deal between Greece and its lenders would lead to the resolution of the situation. \nMinoan said that gross sales were up by 15% and commission by 17% in the current financial year. This comes despite the fall in the price of oil and the knock-on effect on the corporate travel division. \n“[T]he group is continuing to pursue a number of opportunities about which we will update the market and shareholders when they are concluded. The board is confident that the group’s travel division will bear significant fruits in the coming year,” the company said. \nMinoan is due to publish its interim results at the end of the month. \nIn its last full-year results Minoan made an operating loss of £766,00 on revenues of £5.9 million. \nShares in the company fell 7% following the announcement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:44:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
