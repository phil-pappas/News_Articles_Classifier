Aeroflot is certainly not a luxurious airline but its staff are pleasant, the food on board is edible, and the flight time from the UK is shorter than that to Tenerife.\nA car took us the 18 miles to central Moscow. However, the city boasts one of the finest underground systems in the world, and the Green Line goes straight from the airport to the centre.\nWe were staying at the magnificent Metropol Moscow, which combines pre-revolution opulence with informality.\nBreakfast is served in a ballroom decorated with ornate plasterwork surmounted by a superb stained-glass atrium, and caters for every requirement, from sheep’s milk to unlimited prosecco via every sort of bread you can imagine.\n EasyJet plane carrying holidaymakers from Newcastle to Spain... Access all areas: The mindblowing 360-degree photographs of... Noteworthy dedication: Man quits 9 to 5 job to travel the... Finally! Minibar snacks and drinks in Chicago's new Virgin... 20 shares The crowning glory, though, is the harpist. On our first morning I wondered whether she hadn’t been home the night before as she was wearing a full-length evening dress and gold slingbacks.\nYou leave the hotel expecting Soviet chic – shapeless boots, unsmiling faces and monolithic, monochrome apartment blocks – but instead are faced with breathtaking architecture, parks that make New York’s Central Park look like a traffic island, and public art that Antony Gormley would surely gaze at with wonder.\nIn Revolution Square underground station, every niche has a larger-than-life size bronze figure, each one representing the workers, men and women, who made the revolution.\nIn another, the people of Ukraine are represented in mosaics and murals which the Romans would have envied. You could happily spend days on the system admiring its art, cleanliness, and beauty – if not the noise of some of the trains.\nBreakfast is served in a ballroom at the Metropol Moscow hotel and staff cater for your every requirement\nIn fact, the city’s cleanliness is startling. In eight days we saw only one abandoned soft drink can. No empty McDonald’s cartons, no free newspapers blowing in the streets, no chewing gum on the pavements.\nEmerge from the metro at Tretyakovskaya station and it’s a short walk along typically wide streets full of mature trees, laden with singing birds, to the Tretyakov Gallery.\nNow, I’m no fan of art galleries. I hate the crowds and herds of reluctant children texting or taking giggling selfies next to a naked statue.\nThere’s no such problem in Moscow. The few school groups we encountered were attentive and quiet, and the adult visitors, almost all of whom were Russian, relished, like us, being able to appreciate the art unobstructed, and with absolutely no rush.\nGETTING TO MOSCOW Regent Holidays ( regent- holidays.co.uk , 020 7666 1244) offers three nights’ B&B at the Metropol Moscow from £525pp, including return flights from Heathrow and transfers.\nMail on Sunday readers can also receive a free Moscow Hop On Hop Off bus tour by quoting ‘MOS’.\nThis gallery is blessed with a breathtaking collection that can be either an education in Russian artists who we tend to overlook in deference to Western superstars, or an opportunity to see paintings only ever seen online, such as the truly astonishing Black Sea by Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky. It is an expanse of turbulent water that, if you stood on its frame, you feel you could dive into.\nThe gallery also has a portrait collection best seen after a tour of the Kremlin, as many of the dresses and Tsarist robes you’ll see worn in the paintings are on show at the Kremlin. It’s worth having a dedicated guide at the Kremlin as it can cause (like much of what is on offer in Moscow) sensory overload. The elfin Svetlana took us through the Armoury, with its Imperial collection, surprisingly not melted down by the Bolsheviks.\nPeter the Great’s boots, made by himself and truly vast (he was almost 7ft tall), Catherine the Great’s coronation robes, and a massive carriage sent by James I of England are also on show.\nThe Kremlin gardens, heavy with the smell of lilac, are elegant but informal, and the three magnificent gold-domed Orthodox churches within its walls are fascinating when their interiors are explained by an expert such as Svetlana.\nThe Bolshoi Ballet’s Sleeping Beauty is performed on a set that could not be fitted on the Covent Garden stage\nBut a visit to the Kremlin and St Basil’s Cathedral at nearby Red Square don’t give you the deeply moving experience of the Orthodox Church that a visit to the Cathedral of Christ The Saviour brings.\nIts white and gold exterior is stunning. We saw a service, filled with priests, for the Patriarch of Moscow and the glorious singing connects you with old Russia. The congregation move about, drink tea and feed their children, while never sacrificing their reverence for the occasion.\nSadly, there is no room here to detail the modest yet fascinating Bulgakov and Chekhov museums, the staggering glory of the Bolshoi Ballet’s Sleeping Beauty (with its set that could not be fitted on the Covent Garden stage), the old accordion player in the square to whom we danced, or the cafes we visited, with their delicious Russian dumplings called pelmeni.\nBut I can tell you that I was invited to the city by the Moscow Art Theatre – Chekhov’s home – to see their production of my play Maurice’s Jubilee, starring the company’s greatest actor, Oleg Tabakov.\nWith what I came to know as typical Russian generosity, they showered us with gifts, flowers and vodka, made me take a curtain call on that legendary stage, and then presented me with the Stanislavsky Medal for services to world theatre.\nI can’t recommend Moscow enough. Suffer the visa agony and the queues at the airport and go.\nRead more: 500 Error | Regent Holidays", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ISji1U", "http://www.regent-holidays.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-12T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T17:35:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
