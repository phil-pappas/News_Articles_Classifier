To take this photo, I climbed on a hillside with many plants with thorns and fell into a two-meter-deep hole. I was OK, just scared afterward -- what if it was a much deeper hole?\" Hide Caption 1 of 15 15 photos Aer Mountain, Inner-Mongolia – \"In July, Inner Mongolia's Aer Mountain has canola flower blossoms,\" says Wang. \"I got up at 4 a.m. and the place was in thick mist. It's not easy to catch a train photo in the mist, but it looked just like a wonderland. Fortunately, the train was moving real slow so I had plenty of time to catch a good moment.\" Hide Caption 2 of 15 15 photos Jingpeng-Reshui Section, Jitong Railway, Inner-Mongolia – Steam locomotives have been being phased out in China since the 1970s. The last one in service was the Qianjin train (pictured on the Jitong Railway, Inner-Mongolia in 2005). Today, a special Qianjin train runs during the annual Jitong Locomotive Train Photography Festival (usually held in December), which lures thousands of steam locomotive fans each year. Hide Caption 3 of 15 15 photos Jitong Locomotive Train Photography Festival – \"This locomotive belongs to the Jitong Railway Company,\" says Wang. \"The company bought more than 120 locomotives from all over China in the 1990s to haul freight. This made it one of the last railways in the world to operate steam locomotives.\" Hide Caption 4 of 15 15 photos Tuowengai Bridge, South Xinjiang – \"It's great to get the extension, galaxy and train all in one photo,\" says the photographer. \"Usually when you want to shoot the galaxy, there should be no moon or the light will outshine the stars. I checked the lunar calendar and determined the best time to reach this place would be 5 a.m. on December 10.\" Hide Caption 5 of 15 15 photos Tianshan Mountain, South Xinjiang – Wang captured the Tianshan Mountain Section of the South Xinjiang Railway before it was shut down in early 2015. \"The charm of this railway lies in a number of different landscapes including desert, oases, valleys and snow mountains,\" he says. Hide Caption 6 of 15 15 photos Badaling, The Great Wall, Beijing – \"The Qinglongqiao Railway Station, part of China's first Jingzhang (Beijing-Zhagjiakou) Railway, was built in 1908,\" says Wang. \"I have deep feelings for the place -- I grew up near the railway and started shooting my first photos here. I think this long-exposure photo records the beauty of the century-old railway in the most satisfying way.\" Hide Caption 7 of 15 15 photos Danxia Landform, Gobi Desert, South Xinjiang – \"When this train is traveling through the Gobi Desert, the scenes become boring. But the Danxia landforms ignited my passion for beauty,\" says Wang. \"The naturally eroded mountains have mixed colors of red, yellow, gray and white. This photo was taken when my dad and I drove after the trains from Akzo to Kashi.\" Hide Caption 8 of 15 15 photos Harbin-Daqing High Speed Railway, Heilongjiang – \"Heilongjiang Province is the coldest place in China. It was minus 42.5C when I shot this picture. My nostrils were blocked by ice due to waiting (for a train) for too long. I didn't even realize my nose had turned purple. However, looking at the CRH38B cold-proof high-speed train flying down the railway inspired me to keep moving on just like it.\" Hide Caption 9 of 15 15 photos Jalanur Coal Mine, Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia – \"I started chasing steam locomotives in 2006. These are 1960s CQJC steam locomotives in use in a 1902 coal mine. This photo was taken in January 2009. Today, these locomotives are retired, but the mine still stores around 30 of them.\" Hide Caption 10 of 15 15 photos Ren Zi Bridge, Kunming--Hekou Railway – \"The Kunming-Hekou Railway is part of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was built by France from 1904-1910. It's the only narrow-gauge railway in China to use 1,000-millimeter gauge. I was amazed when I arrived. The Ren Zi Bridge has more than 100 years of history, and is an icon of the railway. It's said construction workers would hang on ropes from the mountaintop to build the railway. With low technology and such harsh terrain, many fell and lost their lives.\" Hide Caption 11 of 15 15 photos Nancha, Lesser Khingan Mountains – \"During the 2010 October National Holiday a friend and I took a five-hour train ride from Harbin to Nancha, a small city near the forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. Trains before and after holidays are super crowded, so we stood all the way. We arrived at 4 a.m. and climbed a 200-meter-high hill with a flashlight. We saw this HXN5 diesel locomotive 30 minutes later and got the photo.\" Hide Caption 12 of 15 15 photos Greater Khingan Mountains – \"The Khingan Mountains are among the coldest in China. The average temperature is around -28 C in winter. The snow was as deep as my thigh, which made it really hard to walk. While taking photos in the Khingan Mountains, my feet, nose and ears all suffered from frostbite. However, the snow-covered forests are so fantastic and surreal. This is a photo of K1301 train with the snowy forest as background.\" Hide Caption 13 of 15 15 photos Changbai Mountain, Songhua Lake – \"Hunbai Railway is a 217-kilometer-long track across the mountains and lakes of northeast China -- Changbai Mountain and Songhua Lake. The railway goes through tunnels in the mountain and crosses a bridge when it meets the river. This made me think it might make for an interesting composition. According to the train schedule, three trains pass by in daylight every day. I spent more than an hour climbing a hill to take this photo. The train is K7398, a passenger train from Baihe to Shenyang, the capital city of Liaoning Province.\" Hide Caption 14 of 15 15 photos Sanya, Hainan Western Ring Railway – \"The railway connecting Hainan Island and the mainland was built in 2004. Now the railway from Sanya, a city in China's southeast, reaches major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The weather was extremely terrible when I arrived in Sanya, so the scheduled trains were all delayed 10 to 12 hours. I took this photo on the fifth day, when the weather turned better and the train came on time.\" Hide Caption (CNN) China's rail system is one enormous mass of statistics. It's 120,000 kilometers long (second largest in the world after the United States) and has the highest passenger-per-kilometer ratio in the world -- 1,060 billion passengers in 2013, according to the National Railway Administration of China ). But for one Beijing-based \"photoworm\" -- as photographers are dubbed in China -- it's far more beautiful than a bunch of big numbers. Wang Wei, 25, is possibly the most passionate rail fan in China. Over the past decade he's braved frostbite, unreliable timetables and months away from home while traveling an estimated 300,000 kilometers to capture the country's rail network and its trains in pictures. It's been more than two years since CNN interviewed the then recent university graduate and railway obsessive. Since then, Wang has become a mini-celebrity. He's been interviewed by more than 20 Chinese and overseas media outlets, and even been the subject of a Chinese television documentary. What's more, he has two books being published in China later this year. \"Zhui Huo Che\" (Running After Trains) is a photo book featuring his experiences and photography techniques. Wang often waits hours in sub-freezing termperatures to get the right shot, like this one of a CRH38B high-speed train in Heilongjiang Province. \"My Jing-Zhang Railway\" is an illustrated book showcasing Wang's photos and interviews with people who have worked and lived on the Beijing-Zhangjiangkou line, China's first Chinese-designed and built railway. \"Chinese official have seldom promoted the beauty of the railway and trains,\" says Wang. \"They have never taken pictures of what I've been taken. \"Instead, they take photos of leaders delivering a speech, cutting ribbons. \"I feel the railway belongs to each of us, everyone has the responsibility to promote it if they love it.\" CNN: It's been two years since we last talked. Where have you been lately? Wang Wei: The 200-kilometer Southern Xinjiang Railway (Tianshan Mountain section) stopped running in February 2015, so I brought my dad and three friends there last December. It was really cold in Southern Xinjiang in December -- around minus 30C (minus 22F). Even worse, we were told there were wolves in the area and they're very active at night, which was during my shooting times. We decided to dig a hole and burn branches inside. The fire helped us drive away the wolves and warm ourselves. Most important, I got the photos I want. I also visited Japan and Germany in the last two years. CNN: What impressed you the most during the trips? Wang: The railway culture of Japan and Germany moved me a lot. In Germany, they can buy the abandoned rails and trains for cheap, about RMB100,000 ($16,110) for two compartments, which is around one-tenth of the price in China. They (often) retain the original look of their rail cars and turn them into hostels and restaurants. Really lovely. In Japan, when I took photos of the trains, the staff was friendly and gave me useful instructions like where to get the good angles and so on. This is impossible in China. Here the staff will only tell you go away. You can also see quite a number of books featuring railways in Japan. We have very limited materials on railways in China. The length of China's railway system is the second longest in the world, and the history of Chinese railways is more than 100 years old. I really wish the culture of the Chinese railways can catch up. CNN: How did you get into railway photography? Wang: I am a Beijing native and grew up by a train station. These 1960s steam locomotives in use in a coal mine were captured in 2009. Today, the locomotives are retired. I started taking railway photos in 2005 when I was 15. I have a deep connection with the trains and railways. From my window (in my home), I can see trains every day. The first photos I took were of trains at Beijing North Railway Station, which is next to my place. CNN: What's the secret of a good railroad photo? Wang: I usually make a plan two or three days before shooting. According to the train schedule, color and type, I will think about light and background -- should it be directly light or back lit, things like that. It's actually not too complicated. CNN: Which have been your favorites places? Wang: The Greater Khingan Mountains. The Qinghai-Tibet extension rail. And the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's China section. CNN: Any new trends in the train industry you've noticed? Wang: The new high-speed trains are a growing influence everywhere. In my eyes, the new trains aren't as beautiful as old locomotives. However, from a passenger's perspective, it's good to enhance the speed. CNN: What equipment do you use? Wang: A Nikon D800 and a 28-300 VR lens. It usually happens all of a sudden -- the train comes and there's no extra time for me to change lenses so I need a multiple-use, long-haul lens like that. CNN: How do you travel to your destinations? Wang: I use every form of transportation depending on where I go. Trains and cars half of the time, and on foot the other half. During my trip to northeast China in October 2011, I walked more than 186 kilometers in 15 days, not including the mountains I climbed. It was the only way I could reach the places I wanted to go. CNN: How long do your photo expeditions usually take? The narrow-gauge Kunming-Hekou Railway was built by a French-led concern from 1904-1910. Wang: Depends where I go -- the journey usually takes from 10 days to a month. The longest journey I took was a 56-day trip covering seven provinces -- Beijing, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shannxi, Yunnan and Guizhou in the summer of 2011. CNN: Any difficulties during any of your missions? Wang: To me, the difficulties are finding angles and waiting for trains. I love the high angle, so I usually climb mountains to take photos. Some of the mountains are steep and have dangerous wildlife, like snakes. So I need to be very careful. At night, it's even harder to climb. The trains often change schedules according to the weather or other unpredictable reasons, so it's quite normal for me to wait in one spot a whole day without seeing a train. CNN: Is your family supportive? Wang: Like many Chinese parents, they thought I should go to college and get a degree. So at first they didn't support me at all. But when they heard the experiences of my journeys and saw my photos were getting better and better, they were OK with it. My dad sometimes will join me on photo shoots.
