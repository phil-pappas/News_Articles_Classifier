Arrive and leave from Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum). I will be arriving mid September, and know it is monsoon time... My initial plan is to spend three or four days at TRV, and maybe take a few day trips, such as to Kanyakamari. I am not much into beach type activities, but just asking if anyone has any tips for easy ways to enjoy the weather and local things to see? I expect to head right up to the north by train after a few days, and will return again for a week or two before I depart India, again from TRV, in mid December. The flights are booked, as I wanted to experience some monsoon scenery... so any \"I wouldn't do that if I were you\" tips will not be a help. I am an old geezer, 63, so rock climbing, etc, is low on my list of fun pastimes!
