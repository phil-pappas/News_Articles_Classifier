It'll cost you a pound: Popular tourist... Are you feeling better off? Britons are spending MORE on... Package holiday bookings made in advance, which make up 70 per cent of bookings to Greece,will remain in place, and there has been a surge in last minute bookings since the announcement of a third bailout by the European Central bank.\nAnd holiday company Thomas Cook reports no dip in bookings to Greece.\nA spokesperson told Mail Online Travel: 'With Greece as popular as ever in 2015, Thomas Cook customers are continuing to enjoy their holidays and are experiencing business as usual across our wide range of hotels and resorts.\nCustomers patiently queue up outside a National bank of Greece branch in central Athens\n'Bookings have been strong since the beginning of the year, with less left to sell in the 'lates' period compared to the same period last year.\n'That said, Thomas Cook still has some amazing deals for customers still looking to travel this summer who haven't yet booked, and this diverse hotspot has plenty to keep everyone entertained from culture vultures to foodies and wine enthusiasts, and adults and families alike.'\nOne other reason for an increase in travel to Greece, is the devastating terrorist attack on holidaymakers in Sousse, Tunisia, on June 26, when Seifeddine Rezgui, 23, a jihadi terrorist killed 38 tourists, most of them British.\nAround 300,000 tourists were due to travel to Tunisia, but in the wake of the attack, tour operators were forced to find alternative destinations for them, said Sean Tipton. Greece was the first choice for thousands of holidaymakers.\nAthens: While the capital sees plenty of tourists, the majority of holidaymakers head to island resorts\nBut that's not to say tourists should adopt a laissez-faire attitude to travelling in Greece.\nTwo days ago, Mail Online Travel spoke to Frank Brehany, the Consumer Director of HolidayTravelWatch on what tourists should look out for.\n'Before you travel, you need to talk to your travel insurer to make sure that you will continue to be covered in the event of a crisis escalating,' he said.\n'All sorts of issues can arise if the travel insurer says no because within the terms and conditions of the holiday contract, there is going to be a part that says you need to have insurance.\n'If you're already there and something kicks off you need to make sure to speak with your travel insurer then as well - let them know where you are and what the situation is on the ground.'\nIt's also important to consider the advice given by the UK Foreign Office, though Frank recommends going even further and looking at other country's advisories to their holidaymakers.\n'There's a long way to go': David Cameron on Greece", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1Jscnsg"], "published": "2015-07-20T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T17:39:41.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
