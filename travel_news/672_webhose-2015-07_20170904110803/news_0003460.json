Airfarewatchdog has made a list linking to the sign up pages for major international airlines' newsletters / fare alerts. It's a way to be in the know when it comes to deals as they are launched with major airlines.By signing up, you may just save some money - whether it is an airfare sale, or a drop in price on a route you have set up a fare alert for.\nAirfarewatchdog makes the sign-up process easier by compiling links to these newsletters, and mentions airlines that have recently included money-savers like coupon codes in their respective members-only newsletters. Airfarewatchdog President, George Hobica comments:\n\"It's amazing to the Airfarewatchdog.com staff how hard airlines sometimes make it to find the sign-up pages for their promotional emails, so we spent a good deal of time hunting down the links and putting them all in one place. Airlines increasingly are offering their best fares in private sales that only subscribers ever see. These include special fares but also promo code deals, some of which are individually generated and sent to specific subscribers based on their booking activity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:16:10.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
