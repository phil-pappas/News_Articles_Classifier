European Statistics is today pointing to a 3 % rise in European outbound travel, 0.4 % GDP growth in Europe Zone, low inflation rate and an increase of 270 billion Euros in 2015 compare to 260 billion in 2014. \nBernadette Willemin, the Seychelles Tourism Board director for Europe made this statement when she was presenting the state of business for Europe during the Tourism Board's mid-year marketing meeting. \nWith tourism arrival recovery taking hold for the past five years ( 2011- 2015) on the European market, which brought 63 % market share to Seychelles, the Seychelles Tourism Board took stock of “substantial market lose” in the Russia/CIS with – 23 %. The Seychelles Tourism Board said despite the decrease in arrivals Russia still remains a “major source tourism market for Seychelles’’. \n“For the European market, although we have lost market share compared to 10 years ago, the absolute number of tourism arrivals coming from this market still outweighs other major non-European markets . Europe continues to hold the throne of Seychelles’ leading tourism market’’. Mrs Willemin is confident of closing the business year on 5 % growth. \nMrs Willemin said that markets out of the Euro Zone such as Great Britain recording +36 % increase visitors to Seychelles ( 2011- 2015) had since this year changed its strategy to remain profitable for Seychelles. She said that in Britain she was ‘’ investing heavily on training with travel agents’’ to ensure Seychelles continues to grow its visitor arrival numbers from Great Britain. \nAlthough Europe’s state of business is seen as healthy for Seychelles, the Seychelles Tourism Office in France and Europe said there are factors which continue to hinder the market’s performance. \nThese include the perception of Seychelles as being an expensive destination, air connectivity in some European countries is still a challenge e.g. Finland to date still necessitates for two stops, high taxes on flights ticket which are impacting on consumer buying power and disposable income, and limited FAM / Press trip and educational tour. \nThe Seychelles Tourism Board has also taken stock of the positive factors generating growth of European market. Direct flights out of Paris, increased flight frequencies and increased media presence and growing consumer interest are some of these factors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T15:26:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
