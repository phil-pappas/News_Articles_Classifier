The annual three-day classic motor racing festival will feature more than 20 races covering the full spectrum of motor sport history and have over 10,000 classic cars on display. Attendees will also be able to enjoy live music from Status Quo and Paul Young, anniversary celebrations and aerial demonstrations alongside a number of brand activations from sponsors and event partners, including official fuel partners Jet and SsangYong. \nLast year’s incredible total of 1,125 race entries made the Silverstone Classic not just ‘The World’s Biggest Classic Motor Racing Festival’ but also the largest race meeting ever staged anywhere on Earth. And that figure could be topped in 2015. The oldest car competing is a 1923 Bentley racing in the Kidston Trophy for Pre-War Sports Cars; the most recent a howling Super Aguri raced by Takuma Sato in the 2006 F1 World Championship. The Cosworth V10-powered projectile is part of the exciting new High-Speed Demo for Legends of Modern Formula One. Nick Wigley, CEO of Goose Live Events and Event Director for the Silverstone Classic added: “The Silverstone Classic has become one of our most proud accomplishments and we could not be more thrilled with its growing popularity in recent years. This year will be extra special as we will be celebrating our 25th anniversary so there is a lot to look forward too, the Silverstone Classic really does boast a wealth of attractions and activities to keep all ages amused and engaged” The 25th annual Silverstone Classic will take place from Friday 24th – 26th July at the Silverstone circuit. All tickets must be purchased in advance. Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T15:25:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
