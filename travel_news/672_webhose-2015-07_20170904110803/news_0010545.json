He was named to the National League all-star roster for the first time in a young career after a vote of players, managers and coaches, joining Rockies second baseman DJ LeMahieu in a surprise pick.\nLeMahieu, also a Gold Glove winner last year, will play in his first All-Star game.\nThe 24-year-old Arenado becomes the Rockies' youngest all-star. Tulowitzki was 25 for his first all-star game in 2010. And pitcher Shawn Chacon was 25 when he got in in 2003.\nArenado will back up Cincinnati's Todd Frazier, who won a fan vote to the starting lineup at third base. Arenado is the Rockies' first all-star third baseman since Jeff Cirillo in 2000. Vinny Castilla was a two-time all-star at the position for Colorado, in 1995 and '98.\nThe ascendant Arenado has made quick work of the hot corner in three short years in the majors. He won a Gold Glove award for his defense in his first two seasons, and he was leading the all-star vote last season before a broken hand scuttled his chances.\nAdvertisement But this season, Arenado is even better. His defense remains top-notch. Now his plate prowess has him among the top sluggers in the National League.\nArenado's 68 RBIs were the most in the major leagues entering Monday's play. And his 24 home runs ranked fifth â€” only one behind Frazier and three behind Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton.\n\"His pitch selection has been outstanding,\" Rockies hitting coach Blake Doyle said last week. \"He's in a very good place right now. We only had one guy the last two years this hot. Our shortstop was this time last year too.\"\nTulowitzki, the Rockies shortstop, rumbled through the first three months last season with career-high hitting numbers to earn a starting spot on the NL roster.\nTulowitzki this season started slowly, coming off a season-ending hip surgery last season. But he's caught on lately. He leads NL shortstops in batting average (.321), on-base percentage (.358) and slugging percentage (.489).\nHe finished second in fan voting among shortstops, trailing the St. Louis Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta.\nArenado finished fourth in fan voting among third baseman.\nIt is the first time since 2009 the Rockies didn't earn a starting spot in the All-Star Game.\nColorado Rockies' second baseman DJ LeMahieu (9) slides to stop a ground ball off the bat of Cincinnati Reds' Brayan Pena (29) during the fifth inning of their baseball game played Monday, May 25, 2015 in Cincinnati. (FR171284 AP | Gary Landers) Arenado, though, demanded a spot. He's no Coors Field aberration. Arenado has more home runs on the road (15 to nine), more RBIs (37 to 31) and better on-base (.318 to .309) and slugging (.615 to .580) percentages.\nBut if his hitting failed to arrest the attention of fan voters, his defense put him on nationwide highlight reels. His tumbling, diving catch over the tarp in San Francisco in April was a memory-maker.\n\"You know, in a lot of ways, Nolan looks like a 12-year-old kid playing out on a Little League field,\" Rockies manager Walt Weiss said last month.\nThe 86th All-Star Game will played July 14 at Cincinnati at 5 p.m.\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/nickgroke", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0706/20150706__DJ-LeMahieu~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-06T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:41:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
