It's only one month and you've got to be careful and not get carried away on one month, but I think that hopefully it will remind people that actually there's much more to the New Zealand economy than dairy,\" said Joyce. \n\"Dairy's very important, but there's a bunch of other sectors that are as important individually and collectively, so I think most people looked at the trade figures yesterday — not even so much the China part, but just at them generally — and said they're a bit more resilient than what we expected.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T22:10:35.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
