That is still Montana, North Dakota, Iowa and New Hampshire today.\nThe U.S. today? Closer to Illinois — 63% white.\nBy 2060, whites will be less than 50% of the population, as they already are in three states and almost that way in a fourth. (The Census Bureau projects the country will be 44% white and 29% Hispanic by then.) The Asian share of the population is expected to reach 9% — where it already is in New Jersey. (Overall, New Jersey’s current population is most aligned with how the U.S. as a whole will look in 2025.)\nGo to Time.com to see the data behind the map.\nWhile there’s already plenty of speculation about how that could play out politically — will Democrats gain the bulk of votes from the growing portion of Hispanic and Asian voters, or will Republicans make inroads? — the shifts are already playing out in state and local issues. For example, political pundits have said shifting demographics (including whites from out of state) made it easier for officials in South Carolina and Georgia to take down the Confederate battle flag.\nMore maps on MarketWatch: A map of what matters most to people around the world The most valuable products each state sells to the rest of the world What’s the second-most popular religion in your state?", "external_links": ["http://labs.time.com/story/census-demographic-projections-interactive/"], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T21:33:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
