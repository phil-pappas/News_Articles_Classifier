Despite an early attack from Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo), and the late aggression of Vincenzo Nibali (Astana), Froome was unable to be shaken off. Joaquim Rodriguez (Team Katusha) won the first four climbs of the day, before being overtaken by France's Romain Bardet who opened up a gap of 40 seconds on the picturesque climb up the Lacets de Montvernier. As well as claiming the polka dot jersey, Bardet has also moved into the top ten of the General Classification standings, where he trails Froome by just shy of thirteen seconds. That concludes our blog of the Tour de France this Thursday, but make sure you check back tomorrow for our live coverage of Stage 19, as Chris Froome closes in on his third Grand Tour victory. 16.55 General standings after Stage 18 Position Rider/team Time 1 Chris Froome (GB) Team Sky 74 hr 13' 31\" 2 Nairo Quintana (Col) Movistar +3' 10\" 3 Alejandro Valverde (Spa) Movistar +4' 09\" 4 Geraint Thomas (GB) Team Sky +6' 34\" 5 Alberto Contador (Spa) Tinkoff-Saxo +6' 40\" 6 Robert Gesink (Hol) Team Lotto NL-Jumbo +7' 39\" 7 Vincenzo Nibali (Ita) Astana +8' 04\" 8 Mathias Frank (Sui) Iam Cycling +8' 47\" 9 Bauke Mollema (Hol) Trek Factory Racing +12' 06\" 10 Romain Bardet (Fra) AG2R LA Mondiale +12' 52\" 16.45 Great work once again as @chrisfroome retains his #TDF2015 race lead with no time loss. @GeraintThomas86 also there to keep fourth spot! — Team Sky (@TeamSky) July 23, 2015 16.40 The podium ceremony appears to have been delayed slightly, perhaps because Bardet looks so utterly knackered. But fortunately one of his Ag2r-La Mondiale team mates, Jan Bakelants, had enough breath to offer his opinions on the past five hours of racing. (Romain) is a very strong descender and did very well during this stage of the race. He will enter the top ten after this victory, and to be honest, I think it is better to win a stage like this than to finish 9th or 10th in GC. Romain was the guy tasked with getting the win, and he did, so it has been a good tour for our team. 16.35 . @romainbardet exténué après un effort exceptionnel / exhausted after a fantastic effort! #TDF2015 pic.twitter.com/dDl5kNmSPq — Le Tour de France (@letour) July 23, 2015 #icymi - A look at Bardet's speed up Lacets de Montvernier.

The Yellow Jersey group rolls over the finish line, with Chris Froome tightly bunched together with his main rivals: Nibali, Contador, and the second placed Quintana. There will be no change at the top of the General Classification standings, and that will do Froome and Team Sky very nicely. Geraint Thomas was also part of that elite group.

Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) has won Stage 18 of the Tour de France , and is followed over the finish line by his compatriot Pierre Rolland to give France a 1-2. Bardet shakily lifted his left arm in the air before holding both hands to his head in disbelief, what an achievement for the 24 year old. . @romainbardet remporte l'étape 18 / wins stage 18! #TDF2015 https://t.co/0tHS8n9lJ6 — Le Tour de France (@letour) July 23, 2015 Classement de l'étape / Stage classification #TDF2015 pic.twitter.com/8JBjvQMt96 — Le Tour de France (@letour) July 23, 2015 16.18 Bardet is absolutely storming out in front- his lead over Rolland now extends to 42 seconds- and looks to have a very good chance of winning France her second stage win of the 2015 Tour. Meanwhile, Chris Froome is right at the back of the Yellow Jersey group. Hanging on? Nibali, Valverde and Quintana have around 3km to try and shake him off and make up some valuable seconds. 16.12 Romain Bardet (Ag2r-La Mondiale) has won the five points that were on offer and is now level on points with Rodriguez in the King of the Mountains classification. Chris Froome has dropped from first to third. #TDF2015 Equal points for Joaqum Rodriguez and Romain Bardet in polka dot classification. — Katusha Team (@katushacycling) July 23, 2015 Further behind, Nibali has attempted to launch a couple of attacks, but was twice chased down by Quinta, Contador and Froome. 16.08 Bardet is storming towards the summit and is being vociferously cheered on by his home crowd, as you would expect. He's desperately hunting for those five points that would move him level with Rodriguez in the hunt for the polka dot jersey. Pierre Rolland trails him by 30 seconds. 16.03 The leading pack are now about to start the climb up Montvernier. 15.55 Team Sky are back at the front of the Yellow Jersey group, with Leopold König and Geraint Thomas driving the pack forward. Nicolas Roche has, however, finally fallen off the pace. Further ahead, Bardet's lead stands at 38 seconds. 15.49 Somewhat incredibly, the Tour de France hasn't had a French winner since 1985, when Bernard Hinault- who won all of the Grand Tours in his glittering career- won with his La Vie Claire team. It's far too late for Romain Bardet to make any sort of significant impression on this year's General Classification standings of course, but he currently has a healthy lead out at the front and is seeking to win the next climb (and what a nice climb it is, too...), which would elevate him above Joaquim Rodriguez.

He is now flying on the descent towards Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne. Nibali and Geraint Thomas are fighting tooth and claw to lead the Yellow Jersey group, with Nibali currently edging the contest. Quintana was briefly with them, but couldn't keep the pace. How will Chris Froome respond? 15.32 Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) is the next in line to make an attack. Valverde follows him and bridges the gap, with Chris Froome in hot pursuit. Contador is meanwhile being closed down from behind. 15.28 Back to the Tour. Contador has recruited Warren Barguil, Mathias Frank and Robert Gesink in his charge to catch up with the breakaway group and gain some time on Froome and the Yellow Jersey group. He has already made up 30 seconds. And further back, there has been a crash! Jakob Fuglsang (Astana) has hit the deck, although I am afraid I can bring you no more information than that. I've watched the replay four times but just can't work out how he fell, he definitely didn't make contact with any other rider. He's okay and is back on his bike, but has understandably been left by the wayside by the leaders group that he was riding with. . @jakob_fuglsang à terre / on the ground. #TDF2015 pic.twitter.com/SoDJ5V5eOj — Le Tour de France (@letour) July 23, 2015 15.24 Whilst we're waiting to see how Froome to respond to Contador, here is some news from the UCI. They have decided- finally- to respond to the two disgraceful incidents recently involving spectators of the Tour and Team Sky riders. Chris Froome had urine thrown over him during Stage 14, whilst Richie Porte was punched in the ribs during Stage 10. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and Amaury Sport Organisation (A.S.O), organiser of the Tour de France, have made a joint appeal to cycling fans, asking them to respect the riders. The peloton of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France enters a decisive phase of the race as it enters the Alps, where the riders require optimal conditions in order to perform to their best before arriving in Paris on Sunday. UCI President Brian Cookson and Tour de France Director Christian Prudhomme ask crowds along the roadside to respect every rider, and the integrity of the riders and in particular the Yellow Jersey. The UCI and A.S.O publicly regretted the aggressions suffered by the leader of the overall classification from some spectators during the 14th stage between Rodez and Mende, while at the same time thanking the large majority of the public which respects the athletes. 15.19 Injured? No chance. Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) decides to make his attack. He has a little glance at the rest of the Yellow Jersey group behind him, sees that nobody fancies it, and grimaces off into the distance. He is 45km from the finishing line and, currently six and a half minutes behind Froome in the General Classification standings, Contador needed to make a bold move like this. There hasn't been a response from Team Sky yet, they're currently 20 seconds behind him and don't need to panic immediately, but they will certainly be wary of what Contador is capable of, and they won't want to let him run too far in front. 15.14 Thibaut Pinot has been dropped from the leading group. See-ya Thibaut. Alors qu'il avait réussi à accrocher le bon groupe, @ThibautPinot paye ses efforts de la veille et est repris. pic.twitter.com/hbbVUp0gLc — Prix Antargaz (@PrixAntargaz) July 23, 2015 15.10 The gap between the front twelve riders- which now includes Simon Yates (Orica GreenEdge) after he managed to successfully bridge the gap- and the yellow jersey group now stands at 4 minutes and 11 seconds. Froome is near the front of that latter group, not that the front runners will bother him too much. All of his main GC rivals are closely gathered around him at the moment, and Tinkoff and Movistar both lack the numbers in the group that Sky currently enjoy. There are just shy of 50km remaining. It has been a pretty calm afternoon's watching if you're a Froome fan. Tranquil stuff, this Tour de France business. 15.00 A few of the riders who managed to keep out of the reach of the peloton have actually managed to extend their lead out at the front. Cyril Gautier (Europcar) is up there behind Thibaut Pinot, alongside a couple of Tinkoff-Saxo riders, which will no doubt please Alberto Contador. 14.55 First bit of trouble on what has, up until now, been a very smooth day of riding for Team Sky. The Dutch rider Wout Poels is struggling at the back of the peloton, and briefly fell away before making an almighty effort to reattach himself at the back. Nicholas Roche is still going well at the front of the Yellow Jersey group, however, which is impressive if not a little confusing given the lack of any good reason for Team Sky to push this race forward, given the healthy position of Froome and the rival riders he is in contention with. 14.49 The breakaway group are slowly disappearing. First Thomas De Gendt, now Dan Martin... The reigning King of the Mountains Joaquim Rodriguez still has a nose in front, though, no doubt with his sights firmly set on the enticing 25 points on offer at the top of this climb. 14.47 Great graphic here. Time spent at the front of the race from 60 to 120km mark #TDFdata #TDF2015 pic.twitter.com/J5uiDTODM1 — letourdata (@letourdata) July 23, 2015 14.42 De Gendt has been caught. In fact, it won't be long before the entire group of frontrunners are caught by Froome and the peloton, who are now only two minutes and fourteen seconds behind. The front group are falling apart, in fact, and there a couple of stragglers, including America's Andrew Talansky (Cannondale-Garmin) who have been left completely behind and will be snaffled up by the main pack very shortly. Nicolas Roche and Richie Porte are the men driving the peloton forward, with Froome closely behind. 14.37 The peloton is really starting to chase down that front few. The front, led by Giant - Alpecin and Lotto NL after Team Sky slackened up on the pace a little, are now only two minutes and 32 seconds behind stage leader Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal), who heads the rest of the early breakaway group by twenty seconds. 14.30 The front runners are now crossing a viaduct on the way to the long climb that awaits them, and the fans are lining the road to cheer their favourites on. Two things: the first being that I haven't yet seen many amusing folks in fancy dress, which is a shame. But I'm also yet to see any bottles of urine being sprayed in the faces of any Team Sky riders, so every cloud. 14.24 De Gendt and the Gang (featuring a gutsy turn from Ireland's Dan Martin (Cannondale-Garmin)) are now half a minute ahead of the other half of the breakaway group. The peloton is becoming increasingly fractured, too, with Chris Froome's frontrunners now just over three minutes ahead of the slower riders in the breakaway. And in case you can't read, and have been staring blankly at this page for the past two and a half hours now, wondering what on earth has been going on- here is that above information in natty infographic form.

He is now part of a smaller group that is a minute behind the main peloton, and around four and a half minutes back from the breakaway, currently lead by sprint winner Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal) who is being chased down hard by eleven riders, including that lad Rodriguez. 14.09 Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal), who finished third overall in the 2012 Giro d'Italia, was given far too much space ahead of the only sprint of Stage 18 and won at a canter. He's been part of the breakaway group from the outset, and now accelerates to split the pack. Further behind, Chris Froome (Team Sky) has decided to ramp up the pace of the peloton and it's causing some stragglers to get left behind. He is around 3 minutes 40 seconds behind De Gendt and the other front runners. 14.01 Before the big one, there is the small matter of a sprint down at Rioupereuex to take care of. After that, the climbing will really begin to hurt at Allemont, where the gradient increases to 15% on the way to the summit of 1,924 metres. Recorded average speeds of the first 4 to pass over Col de la Morte. #TDF2015 #TDFdata pic.twitter.com/q2pFC01ORL — letourdata (@letourdata) July 23, 2015 13.56 The big climb of the day, the 21.7km Col du Glandon, is fast approaching, and the peloton are now within 3 minutes and 36 seconds of the breakaway. 13.54 The breakaway group, followed by the peloton around three and a half minutes behind, now descend toward the La Romanche river. And if you want to watch to learn how to descend a mountain properly, just watch this. Of course I've probably now cursed Sagan to suffer a spectacular fall now, but he is still amongst the peloton at present. 13.48 No prizes for guessing who has won the fifth climb of today's stage of the Tour. Yup, Jonny Rodders just loves those polka dots too much to lessen up his grip on that King of the Mountains jersey. He is now seven points ahead of Froome. 13.40 With the summit of the appealingly named Col de la Morte fast approaching- and I'm sure that the village at the top doesn't enjoy a great deal of passing trade with that enticing moniker- the breakaway are being chased down by the peloton. With the wind increasing, the gap is down to less than four minutes. News of an abandonment to bring you, too. Australia's Mark Renshaw (Etixx - Quick-Step) has withdrawn with an unidentified problem. This is bad news for Britain's Mark Cavendish- as Renshaw works as his lead out man during sprints. With the earlier exit of Tony Martin, Cav will have his work cut out in Paris now. Mark Renshaw had enough of the climbs today and is out of the #tdf . He was in 8.9% of all cycling teams in #tdfgame . https://t.co/qUQAunZFES — Tour de France game (@tdfgame) July 23, 2015 13.30 All of the leading top ten riders in the general classification are safely in amongst the peloton, and chasing the breakaway group, currently led by Thibaut Pinot (FDJ). There are 28 other riders currently riding with him at the front of the race, around 5 minutes ahead of the chasing pack. Team Sky are at the back of the peloton and happy for the other teams to do some of the hard graft at present. The breakaway group won't bother them, as it contains nobody who has any hope of stealing Froome's yellow jersey. 13.20 Being caught up by the breakaway didn't do Rodriguez too much harm, he has just won the fourth peak of the day to overtake Chris Froome in the King of the Mountains charge and, as it stands, he will be wearing that fetching polka dot jersey come tea time. 13.10 Flush from this third successive points victory, Rodriguez (Team Katusha) decided to go on a bit of a charge, but he was soon reeled in by the rest of the breakaway. The gap between the breakway and the peloton, meanwhile, is around 5 minutes and 40 seconds. 13.00 The third climb has been settled, and Joaquim Rodriguez (Team Katusha) has won to go level on points (61) with Chris Froome (Team Sky) in the King of the Mountains points! 12.50 Rohan Dennis (BMC), who won the first individual team trial to take the 2015 Tour's first yellow jersey- remember him?- has just decided to go off on a bit of a charge with no fewer than 131km remaining. The tyke. Given the lack of a certain Van Garderen, however, the BMC domestique does have far more freedom to push forward. The peloton is still intact, with all of the big boys in the mix, around 5 minutes behind those who broke away not long after the start. But here's some shocking news: Peter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo) is not part of the breakaway. Perhaps his balls have shrunk slightly overnight, nobody knows. 12.45 There is also news of another abandonment to bring you, unfortunately. We are sad to announce, @LouisMeintjes will abandon @letour today due to illness.

Already there has been a breakaway, of around 29 riders and containing strong contenders such as Pinot, Rodriguez and Rolland. They are around 4 minutes ahead of the main peloton, of which Chris Froome (Team Sky) and the other yellow jersey contenders are a part of. Joaquim Rodriguez has won the first mountain classification points on offer: he was first up the category two Col Bayard, as well as the category three Rampe du Motty. He is now only two points behind Froome in the race for the polka dot jersey. . @PuritoRodriguez , 1er au sommet du Col Bayard. Il n’est plus qu’à 4 pts de @chrisfroome . #letourapois pic.twitter.com/iKNENQ0Kp7 — Carrefour France (@CarrefourFrance) July 23, 2015 12.30 The last stage of the Tour, of course, witnessed the incredibly disappointing withdrawal of the much-liked Tejay Van Garderen (BMC Racing), who pulled up by the side of the road after riding alongside the medical car, apparently with a migraine. Van Garderen, who left in the team car in floods of tears, was aiming to become the first American since Lance Armstrong Greg LeMond to win the Tour de France. \"It almost feels like I just want to disappear right now,\" Van Garderen said yesterday evening, after his early exit. \"It is hugely disappointing to have gone from fighting for a podium to being out of the race. It was hard to look my teammates in the eyes (and) it was hard to call my wife and explain to her what was going on.\" Cycling in a nutshell: hard and disappointing. 12.15 Some more on today's stage, which begins with the second-category Col Bayard, and features six more categorized climbs after that... Interactive: TDF stage 18 12.00 Football fans may obsess over the design of their club's new kit in the off-season, but no sport attaches so much precedence as to what the competitors are wearing as cycling. It's where elite sport and Gok Wan combine in perfect harmony. So here is your essential run down of who is wearing what today. The Tour de France: as it stands after stage 17 Chris Froome (Team Sky) again wears that rather fetching maillot jaune, and if he is able to successfully fend off the attacks of his closest rivals during this pivotal stage, there is a very good chance it will remain his until the end of the tour. Nairo Quintana (Movistar) is in second spot and Froome's closest competitor, and will surely attack hard today. Meanwhile, Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) moves into third after the unfortunate Tejay Van Garderen (BMC Racing) was forced to quit the tour during the last stage after suffering from a migraine. And, along with eating loads of chocolate and exposing yourself to too much light, riding hundreds of kilometres in the most exacting cycling race on Earth isn't really recommended when you have a migraine.

Mark Cavendish (Etixx-Quick Step) is fourth and has yet to break the 200pt mark. What that says about his balls remains to be seen.

Which translates, roughly, as the 'Shoe Laces'. That is because the highly picturesque road that slinks up this category two climb provides several very narrow switchbacks for attacks near the finish line, and curves up the mountain face like, urm, a shoelace. Despite this, Stage 18 is the only Alpine stage on this year's Tour without a mountain finish. But don't let that fool you into thinking this is all going to be a walk in the park for the riders who have survived this far; the Glandon and Montvernier are perfectly suited to attacks and the peloton, and in particular the leader Chris Froome, are going to have to watch their backs.
