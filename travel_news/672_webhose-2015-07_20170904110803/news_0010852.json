He was the creator of the microadventurer which encourages people to go outdoors, get out of their comfort zone and live life to their full potential. It can be close to home, cheap, simple, short, and a lot of fun! If you are looking for a staycation close to home, why not turn it into one of my suggestions for microadventures? Your Staycation Guide to MicroAdventures Subscribe to Sebastian’s weekly video blog here . \nI love going on adventures but sometimes there can be so much going on that it’s hard to find time to plan them let alone go on them. This is why I love the idea of going on microadventures – you can do it overnight or on a weekend. You can go somewhere close to home and on a tight budget. It means there’s no excuse! A few weeks ago I decided to go on my own microadventure so I called up my good friend Zak and asked if he’d be keen to go on and adventure with me – he was! So a few weeks later we found ourselves heading to the North of Devon where we went swimming in freezing cold rivers, cooked dinner on the fire, explored the coastline, found new townships, played football on the beach, made new friends and went sand duning! Top 10 Tips to Create a Staycation Microadventure \nAfter having such an awesome experience microadventuring I decided to put together a list of top 10 tips for anybody who, like me, craves adventure but doesn’t necessary always have the time to go abroad. So here they are, my top 10 microadventure tips: Enjoying a microadvneture close to home \n1. Go somewhere you’ve never been before but close to home. Many avid travelers have been all over the world but often haven’t made time to explore their own back yard. There are so many wonderful places close to home yet to be discovered. \n2. Go with a friend or a family member who also enjoys adventure. With so many distractions in todays society we don’t give ourselves the time to just sit and chat. A microadventure is the perfect opportunity for this! \n3. Turn your phone off and just take in your surroundings – it’s amazing what we miss when we spend so much time looking down at our phones. Instead look up, breathe deep and smile! The world is full of everyday miracles we just have to make sure we’re fully present and not distracted to appreciate them! \n4. If you can find a spot to have a fire, cook your dinner on it! There’s something very primal and rewarding about this experience. Roasted vegetables on the fire are the best! Wrap them up in tin foil and leave them to cook. Yum yum! \n5. Look at the world with fresh eyes by being a tourist in your own country – be curious, excited and willing to learn! It’s amazing how everything looks so different when you’re a tourist! \n6. Go for a dip, even if it’s a quick one! If you can find a pond, lake, stream or the sea – jump in, even if it’s freezing. You’ll feel great afterwards! This water is inviting \n7. Do something that scares you – while still being safe! When I went on my last microadventure we set up a rope swing at the top of the hill. It was terrifying but once Zak and I both did it, it felt awesome! An adventure is never complete until you do something that scares you a little. \n8. Be open minded and friendly to everyone you come into contact with on your adventure – positivity is contagious and makes you feel good too! \n9. Bring a camera to capture your favourite moments. It’s awesome being able to share your microadventure experiences with others and hopefully inspire them to go on their own! \n10. The secret to microadventures is to do them often – try and make them a weekly or at least a monthly thing. Create a list of all the wonderful places near you that you’d like to visit and then just do it when you’ve got an evening or weekend to spare! I hope you found these tips helpful! It would be great to hear about any microadventures that you’ve been on or have planned.
