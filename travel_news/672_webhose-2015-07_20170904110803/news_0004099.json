Earlier reports today said DenPasar International airport in Bali re-opened. Shortly thereafter Virgin Australia canceled all flights to and from Bali as Mount Raung volcano flared up again. \nApparently the wind direction changed and flights started flying again. Therefore reports said the airport just reopened again for the second time today, other reports say the airport remain closed until 6 am tomorrow Friday morning. \nIt appears air traffic controllers open the airport depending on changing winds from the volcano causing airlines to cancel or delay flights, even though the airport may be open. \nPassengers should check with airlines before heading to the airport for inbound and outbound flights to Bali.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T22:02:07.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
