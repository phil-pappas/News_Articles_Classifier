Minimum credit limit: $6,000\n* Points awarded only on the first $6,000 of monthly spend on the AMEX and the first $6,000 of monthly spend on the Visa\n^ Currently waived in the first year\nEarning frequent flyer points for free flights To get you off to a flying start, apply for the ANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum cards by August 20 2015 and spend at least $3,000 within three months of approval to net a cool bonus of 50,000 Qantas frequent flyer points .\nThat's enough for a one-way upgrade from business class to first class on Qantas' Sydney-Dallas flights – the world's longest flight by distance – or from premium economy to business class or even economy to premium economy on the same route.\nBeyond the bonus and assuming you remain within the monthly points capping limits of $6,000 per card, a completely free one-way economy flight from Sydney to Melbourne is yours after spending $8,334 on the AMEX or $25,000 on the Visa.\nThat can also be reduced to a spend of $5,334 on the AMEX or $16,000 on the Visa when paying the applicable travel taxes and fees with money rather than points, which currently costs $30.13.\nFor every dollar spent directly with Qantas – such as on flight bookings in $AUD or on Qantas Club membership – you'll also net one extra point per dollar spent, taking you even closer to your next free flight.\nANZ Frequent Flyer Platinum cards: insurance Cardholders receive free international travel insurance when holding a return ticket for trips of six months or less and charging at least $250 of pre-paid transport, accommodation, hire cars or tours to one of the ANZ Platinum cards before leaving Australia.\nThat threshold is on the more generous side, as some other banks have pre-paid spending requirements of $500-$1,000 which can leave jetsetters without cover on less-expensive flights to nearby countries like New Zealand, Fiji and even Singapore and Hong Kong during sale periods.\nANZ also offers purchase security insurance, extended warranty cover, a 'best price guarantee' scheme, interstate flight inconvenience insurance and rental vehicle excess cover in Australia should you have an accident in a hire car.\nFor the most part, that's expected of a Platinum card, although rental vehicle excess cover trumps the insurance offerings of a number of other Platinum cards.\nHow it compares If your focus is Qantas Frequent Flyer points, ANZ dishes out more points per dollar on its American Express Platinum card than the comparable CBA Platinum Awards (1.25/$1) and Westpac Altitude Platinum (1/$1) cards, and is on-par with NAB at 1.5 points per dollar.\nHowever, NAB offers a lower annual fee after the first year – $250 vs. ANZ's $295 – and is better-suited to high spenders, offering points on payments of up to $50,000/month using either card against ANZ's cap of $6,000 on each the AMEX and the Visa (totalling $12,000/month).\nWhichever bank you choose, one thing less-impressive is the earning rate on the companion Visa card at just 0.5 points per dollar, or 1/3 of what you'd get from the AMEX.\nIf you're dropping a sizeable chunk of coin with merchants that don't accept American Express, you could pair your Big Four AMEX with something like the Jetstar Platinum MasterCard : using that in place of the ANZ or NAB Visa card.\nWith an annual fee of $149, you'll pocket one point per dollar – twice the earning rate of the ANZ Qantas Frequent Flyer Platinum Visa and the NAB Qantas Rewards Premium Visa – and can earn up to 100,000 points per year.\n Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on Email: @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin New ANZ Rewards Black cards ANZ Frequent Flyer Visa, American Express GE Money 28 Degrees MasterCard 0 report reply 1 16 hours, 32 minutes ago by 11sjw\nThe capping kills the value if you're running personal and business expenses through it like I was.

I use the AMEX for most transactions and have barely used the VISA card at all (I use a HSBC platinum where I get 1:1 points and QC passes, until they drop that early next year).", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://www.anz.com/personal/credit-cards/optional-extras/edine/", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:20:51.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
