During this period, the company rapidly grew its service-industry client base as it welcomed new brands across several different verticals, in addition to introducing a new performance management solution and hosting its annual Collaborate user conference . \n\"PeopleMatter was created with one overarching goal -- to deliver the most intuitive, easy-to-use workforce management software possible,\" said Nate DaPore, president and CEO of PeopleMatter. \"The industry is certainly taking notice, as demonstrated by the rapid growth achieved in the first six months of 2015. As we continue to expand our capabilities and deliver solutions that help our clients' operations and people thrive, we expect this momentum to continue far into the future.\" \nAmong the highlights of PeopleMatter's exceptional performance in the first half of 2015 is the welcoming of more than 30 new brands that have partnered with the company, enabling PeopleMatter to both grow its footprint in its existing verticals and expand into new ones, including: restaurants, convenience stores, hospitality, retail, staffing, and oil lube and filter service. The company's solutions are used by service-industry employers to automate and connect all of their people processes, across their multiple locations, in order to run a more efficient and profitable business. Together, its new clients represent more than 66,000 total employees across more than 2,500 individual locations, further highlighting the robust growth and increasing demand for PeopleMatter's solutions. \nPeopleMatter was selected as the provider of choice in many competitive situations due to several factors. For one, the company is highly regarded for its expertise in the hourly service industry and proven ability to meet the talent management needs of large and decentralized service organizations. Also crucial was the company's robust integrated platform that offers cutting-edge applicant tracking, onboarding, training and scheduling solutions all within the same system. In addition, clients benefit from the company's high level of configurability and seamless integrations with their existing workforce management systems. \nAlso driving the company's rapid momentum was the release of its latest offering, PeopleMatter PERFORMâ„¢ , which automates the entire employee performance management process, from conducting performance evaluations to providing feedback and creating development plans. This innovative solution was developed to meet demand among employers for a more intuitive approach to performance management and to transform the process into an easy, intuitive and valuable business function. The fully mobile-optimized PERFORM solution enables users to conduct performance management activities where and when it is most convenient, while delivering the high level of visibility into the workforce necessary to drive continuous improvement. \nAnother milestone from the first half of the year was PeopleMatter's well-received Collaborate '15 , the company's latest user conference. Held May 4 through May 6, 2015, the event gathered 250 professionals and thought leaders from some of the most successful service-industry companies to learn about the latest market trends and issues, as well as the new products and mobile innovations PeopleMatter is adding to its platform in 2015. The event also included an awards ceremony recognizing seven PeopleMatter customers for their outstanding culture, service and returns on investment. \n\"If our performance in the first half of the year is any indication, PeopleMatter is well positioned for continued growth and success in the months and years ahead,\" said DaPore. \"In this short period of time, we have grown by every measure and across all verticals; these results are a testament to the strength of our team and the quality of our solutions. As we look toward the coming months, we expect this growth to continue in full force as more service industry employers recognize the value of partnering with PeopleMatter to manage their dispersed workforce.\" \nAbout PeopleMatter PeopleMatter is a powerful and complete workforce management platform designed to fit the specific needs of service-industry brands.
