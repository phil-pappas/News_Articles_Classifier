This will explain what’s covered and what’s not, as well as policy limits, excesses and guidelines for making claims - such as obtaining a written police report if you have been a victim of theft. Our survey found that only a fifth of people do this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
