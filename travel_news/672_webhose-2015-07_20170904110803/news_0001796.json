Explore the wild side of this wonderful island. \nTenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Europe - and it's not surprising! A quick scan of its attractions reveals something for people of every inclination, whether it is the world-class spas, gorgeous beaches with crystal clear blue waters for water sports and diving, charming and romantic villas nestled in lush plantations, fun parks, posh hotels, golf courses, marinas, and even a bustling nightlife. However, even with its modern comforts, including two airports and an excellent airport shuttle service, the main draw of the island remains its wild natural beauty and eternal sunshine. \nThe Wild Beauty of Tenerife \nAlthough the largest of the Canary Islands, Tenerife measures less than 2,000 square kilometres. Despite its size, it can be separated into several regions, each with distinct microclimates. This makes it extremely geographically diverse; in winter, for example, snow-capped mountains are just miles away from sunny beaches. Modern developments also provide stark contrast between the old and the new, with ancientplantations, and modern resorts, complete with state-of-the-art golf courses. (Incidentally, for golf aficionados, the airport shuttle service makes it easy to bring your own clubs.) Below are some of the most beautiful natural attractions of the island. \nBeaches \nIt would be impossible to choose which of Tenerife’s many beaches is the most beautiful. In fact, it would even be difficult to choose the top ten! Playa Tejita is one of the largest natural beaches on the island, with its startlingly blue water set against the backdrop of Montana Roja (Red Mountain). In contrast, Playa Jardin was ‘improved’ by the addition of a colourful botanical garden, accenting the shape of the beach and livening up its natural flora. \nWildlife \nWildlife thrives in Tenerife and it boasts several wildlife and animal parks, including Jungle Park (which features big cats, reptiles, primates, and exotic birds); Monkey Park (which features monkeys and apes in addition to reptiles and birds); and Loro Park (its most famous zoo). There are also several aquatic parks, dolphin and whale cruises, a camel ‘park,’ and a butterfly farm featuring more than 800 species of butterflies. \nVolcanoes \nDespite its small size, Tenerife is home to the third largest volcano in the world - the still active Mount Teide. (Teide is also the highest mountain in Spain at 3,718 metres.) In the past, tourists could go up and right into the crater of this majestic mountain; sadly, this practice has been discontinued for safety reasons. However, you can still ride a cable car part of the way up to as high as 3,550 metres. If you wish to challenge yourself, you can also try hiking up for the base of Montana Blanca, which can take you up to 2,220 metres. Be warned, it’s quite a challenging trek, however. \nEven on your airport shuttle service you'll be treated to a display of just how wonderful and diverse the nature of this island is. Make sure you explore as much as possible of it up close and personal.
