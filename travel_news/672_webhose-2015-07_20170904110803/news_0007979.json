Vienna also reported particularly strong growth compared to 2014 from South Korea (86,000 overnights, +29%), Serbia (79,000, +25%), Turkey (71,000, +28%), India (40,000, +41%) and Taiwan (36,000, +57%). Despite the expansion of Vienna's hotel accommodation between June 2014 and June 2015 - an increase of 3,700 to 63,800 beds - room occupancy rose from 65% to 66% over the same period. \n\"International overnights account for more than 80% of Vienna's total volume of overnights. This not only reflects Vienna's continued attractiveness, but also shows that our systematic internationalization strategy of diversifying into many different markets is paying off,\" explains Kettner. His objective now is to increase Vienna's overnights to 18 million by the year 2020. Vienna has been equally successful as a congress metropolis: the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) ranked the Austrian capital in second place worldwide for its international congresses in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:03:03.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
