In China, where it has been big news, the blueprint’s architects call it the Belt and Road Initiative, namely the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Yet for many people in Europe, this grand design, for all its undoubted importance and bold, far-reaching ambitions that are driving it, has remained relatively unknown. However, several weeks ago it took concrete shape. On a visit to Pakistan on April 20, Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled the first major project to be funded by the $40 billion Silk Road Fund that China set up to make the Belt and Road Initiative a reality. The project was a £1 billion hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in north eastern Pakistan. The Karot Hydropower Project, which is being built by a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corp, is to begin construction by the end of this year, and was the subject of just one of 51 agreements worth a total of $46 billion (£30 billion) signed by China and Pakistan during the president's visit. More than 30 agreements related to a keystone of the Belt and Road Initiative, creating a 1,860-mile economic belt and trade corridor linking China’s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. The projects given the green light included an upgrade of the port, as well as a new airport, roads, rail links and resource pipelines. Kamel Mellahi, a professor of strategic management at Warwick Business School, said the investment would shorten China’s energy import route from the Middle East and transform Pakistan into a regional economic hub. The projects given the green light included an upgrade of the port, as well as a new airport, roads, rail links and resource pipelines “This is China’s Silk Road strategy in action,” he said. “Regional connectivity is the main objective of the strategy, and there is little doubt that we are going to see similar — albeit not this large — Chinese investment projects in other parts of Asia. It’s a win-win project for all involved.” In April, a government official working on the Belt and Road Initiative, Ou Xiaoli, said China's leadership had already approved a list of big-ticket infrastructure projects. Although details about the location and nature of those other projects were yet to be made public, the news came after official documents issued in March confirmed the scope of the plan China hopes to forge in consultation with more than 60 countries and regions. The “vision and proposed action plan” issued by China’s State Council called for stakeholders to “jointly push forward the construction of international trunk passageways and form an infrastructure network connecting all sub-regions in Asia, and between Asia, Europe and Africa, step by step”. It also revealed that China has been advocating a network of free trade and bonded zones, and massive cross-border financial reform, potentially across three continents. ‘Flexibility of mind’ The initiative has dominated discussion in political, business and media circles in China, and has begun to gain more attention in Central and Southeast Asia. But in Europe, the Belt and Road Initiative has continued to be accompanied by a question mark. So what exactly is it? The idea, first floated by President Xi in late 2013, was to create contemporary equivalents of the ancient Silk Road trade route that linked Asia and the Mediterranean. However, the modern belt and road would attempt to go well beyond bales of Chinese silk on swaying camel backs or crates of spices crossing oceans on trade winds. Professor Kerry Brown, director of the Sydney University China Studies Center, said the initiative would seek to create a “massive free trade zone”, a “belt of prosperity” and “an area of common economic interest” that in part leveraged the shared cultural and historical narrative of the Silk Road. “It’s a relatively easy way of China demonstrating more regional importance without people leaping up and down and saying, ‘This is China being too domineering.’ It stresses reciprocity,” he said. “Presumably, it’s going to involve things that all the countries (involved) want to embrace. “So far, the idea has been embraced. There are a lot of other countries keen on it. People haven’t been getting too uneasy.” While the scope and scale of China’s initiative remained hazy, Prof Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Centre, said what could be interpreted as a lack of detail may be planning flexibility on the part of China. “I suspect there’s been a great deal of planning behind the scenes in various think tanks and institutions in China to put flesh on the bones of the idea, but I suspect there’s also a certain amount of flexibility of mind,” he said. Ever since the era of opening-up and reform, there’s been a willingness to be flexible on economic thinking in China. “It will be likely that, in this particular case, there will be a certain amount of understanding that one will have to adapt to circumstances as the policies are put forward and things actually change.” Sheng Shiliang, a researcher at the State Council’s Development Research Center, one of the think tanks that has helped to shape the Belt and Road Initiative, described it as a means for countries to “connect development strategies with each other and make their respective advantages complementary to each other”. The connections would be literal, Mr Sheng said, creating physical trade routes and integrated zones of economic collaboration that stretch north, west and south of China. “The belt emphasises creating passages (from China’s) west and south,” he said. “It includes a road that will connect to Europe through Central Asia and Russia, a road that connects (China) with the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea through Central Asia and West Asia, and a route through Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Indian Ocean. “The road will head southwards. It will include two routes, one from coastal ports in China to the Indian Ocean through the South China Sea that eventually goes to Europe, and another from coastal ports in China to the South Pacific Ocean through the South China Sea.” Arterial roads suitable for freight and heavy traffic, new airports and deep-water ports, and international, conventional and high-speed rail lines have all been options either predicted by experts or mooted by the Chinese government. In the Pakistan deal, almost all of these options have been employed. Prof Brown said a high-speed railway linking China to places such as Europe and Russia was a “perfectly doable deal”. “The idea of having fast trains to get from Beijing to Moscow in a couple of days, or even into Europe, would be revolutionary,” he said. “It has actually been talked about. It’s not an issue of technology. The capital probably is there. It’s kind of a question of all parties agreeing and feeling like they get something, and (then working out) who pays what.” Bu Shaohua, a research assistant with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Research Institute, said participating countries would be connected by a patchwork of old and new infrastructure. So far, the idea has been embraced. There are a lot of other countries keen on it “It’s a mixture of both (old and new),” he said. “In some areas we need to improve the railways that exist, but in other areas we need to build new ones, like those connecting Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran, and the south Caucasus.” Beyond physically connecting participating countries, the initiative would also seek to create trade and financial compatibility. This, experts said, is the wild card in the deck that could prove to be either the easiest or most difficult to play. “At present, the level of economic collaboration between China and other countries along the road is not good enough to set up free trade zones, but there is no doubt that free trade zones will eventually become a reality,” Mr Sheng said. Asia has lacked a common economic framework for a long time, according to Prof Brown, who said Asian economies do not easily work together because they were at different levels of development. “In one fell swoop, this Belt and Road Initiative kind of creates a world in which, economically, everyone’s path ends at the door of China,” he said. “But it’s not a path that people are unwilling to walk. It’s not a political domination; it’s more like a stressing of mutual benefits.” Investment partners For all the mystery that has enshrouded the initiative for some people, the biggest question that hangs in the air may be over who is going to pay for what. Fifty-seven countries have signed on as founding members of the new China-initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the establishment of which Brown said was a sign China is “willing to offer some capital support”. In addition to the $100 billion for the bank’s coffers, China has also pumped $40 billion into the Silk Road Fund, and in March private investors created the Green Silk Road Fund with 30 billion yuan (£3.2 million). While Prof Brown said it was possible China would provide some countries along the road with low-interest, long-term loans, similar to those given in Africa for large infrastructure projects, he believed that for the most part Beijing would be seeking investment partners. “They will probably look for reciprocal deals where part of the money comes from China and part of the money comes from elsewhere,” he said. “They would want a pretty big benefit, or it would have to be a pretty important sector for them to go ahead solo. “I don’t think China at the moment is in a position where it is going to be a big giver of charity. It wants reciprocity and shared risk, and I think that’s more sustainable.” The other big question international commentators have been grappling with is China’s motives for the Belt and Road Initiative. Some pundits have seen it primarily as a push for more diplomatic clout. Prof Mitter said the initiative was a new vision of geopolitical order in which China is seen as a co-operative, responsible power that brings something to the table in terms of a recasting of order. “The idea of the Silk Road strategy, I think, is very much to try to go to the next stage in terms of this idea or a new offer in international order. I think the only way that such an order can be successful is if there are advantages to be found on all sides,” he said. “Clearly other actors, whether it is countries or international institutions, are not going to sign up to a new vision of order where they are going to be disadvantaged compared with the present scenario. Therefore, if China is taking a leadership role in this, it has to think very carefully and very strategically about how it can bring that about.” Prof Yang Cheng at East China Normal University said that beyond politics, China’s economy needed the plan to work, particularly because making landlocked western China a trade gateway to Europe and Asia and the Middle East would provide the long-sought-after springboard for the region to develop. “We need it in both political and economic terms,” he said. “As China is undergoing economic transformation, economic growth is slowing down. Against the background of this new normal (lower GDP growth as a result of economic restructuring), we should find a new engine for development. So we need to seek new markets to export our products. “Another domestic problem is that the level of development in the eastern, central and western regions of China is not balanced. The central and western regions lag behind the eastern region (in turns of development and) in going global. This problem is urgent because it affects our sustainable development.” Prof Brown said it was possible that, like in Africa, Chinese companies would most likely benefit from any infrastructure boom in Asia driven by the initiative. In the case of the recent Pakistan deal, Chinese companies have won contracts to build and operate a number of facilities, including the new hydropower dam. However, he said just because the Belt and Road Initiative was good for China does not mean it was not good for other countries. Inherent in the need to get countries on board was the opportunity for other players to get what they want, he said. “They (participating countries) can probably get a lot from this engagement if they are very clear about what they want,” he said. Prof Mitter agreed: “One would imagine that there would be a whole variety of people coming out of Beijing going and saying to a variety of potential partners, ‘What is it that will help you to buy into this vision?’” Beyond Asia, he said he saw clear opportunities for Europe, and added that one thing that would be advantageous for Britain and Europe as a whole was access to a much more integrated trading area in Eurasia. “What seem key here are free trade agreements,” he said. “If free trade agreements are actually signed up and genuinely offer a reduction of the current investment barriers that exist in large parts of the region, that will be a huge advantage.” Experts said the benefits of the initiative could go two ways, with participating countries able to get more access to sell their goods and services in China’s growing consumer market. That may still be far off. As Prof Mitter put it, China’s challenge of juggling a changing domestic economy at home while pushing forward with the Belt and Road Initiative outside its borders could not be understated. However, when it came to the kind of financial reform, new infrastructure and free trade agreements called for in the initiative, Prof Brown said China had a big incentive “to do it, and do it quickly”. “I think they’ll want to see some kind of specific returns soon, even in the next seven or eight years,” he said. “They will want to see action and joint projects and some increases in trade volumes... They are thinking 10, 20 and 30 years down the line. Its both a short- and long-term strategy.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
