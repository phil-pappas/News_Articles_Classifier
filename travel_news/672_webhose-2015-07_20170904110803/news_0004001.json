From shopping to beaches, from theme parks to traditional localities and from museums to nightlife, it has it all. Below are 9 attractions for you to explore on your next holiday to Los Angeles. Hollywood Walk of Fame Hollywood and Los Angeles are synonymous with each other. It is one of the top attractions of LA and hence it features right on the top of my list. While, many like to see the famous Hollywood sign, I would recommend walking the entire Hollywood Walk of Fame and soak in the aura of this happening street. Relatively quiet during the day, this street bursts into hectic activity during the evening and night hours. It is full of shopping avenues, crazy street artists and hosts many interesting things to do. Madame Tussaud’s wax museum, Ripley’s believe it or not, Chinese theatre, Egyptian theatre, Disney Shops and many more are on offer here. Each one offers a certain glamour quotient. This is one street that you cannot miss. Universal Studios A great film studio and theme park located close to Hollywood, Universal Studios is famous for its theme park rides, top of the line movie theatres and city walk. The Fast and the Furious Supercharged, King Kong 360 3D, Dare to Ride, WaterWorld, Transformers – The Ride 3D, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem and the Simpsons ride are some of the top rides and attractions in the theme park and all of these are big hits with people of all age groups. In addition, you can check out their film studios and get a deeper understanding of how these movies were created. And then there are many restaurants and shops to keep you occupied while you explore the CityWalk at day or night. This entertainment capital of LA is a top place to visit Olvera Street This might come as a surprise to many, but there is a deeply cultural and traditional side to Los Angeles. With narrow cobbled streets and large beautiful churches, the area around Olvera street is where LA was born. With a distinct Mexican character, this is the place to go to if you want a traditional Mexican meal and some classic margaritas. I would definitely recommend this place for a sun-downer drink and some traditional Mexican shopping. Santa Monica Route 66 ends here and its pier commands iconic status, but Santa Monica is not just about these two. Located 30 minutes outside of LA, this place offers great surfing, shopping, dining, nightlife, entertainment, hiking and much more. Malibu and the houses of Hollywood celebrities lie to its north and the beautiful Venice beach lies to its south. With so much to do here, a lot of travelers who seek quiet holidays base themselves here on their LA holiday. Rodeo Drive If luxury shopping is your thing, you cannot get any better than Rodeo drive. This 2 mile stretch that is full of luxury stores and the best brands in the business has been immortalized in many movies. The most famous scene is that of Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman. The Rodeo drive walk of style is an attraction that you should check out along with the shops and hotels. Located in the famous Beverly Hills area of LA, a lot of people combine a Rodeo drive visit with a visit to Wilshire and Sunset Boulevard. Basically, this is one area you go to to see the rich, fancy life. Sunset Boulevard One of Los Angeles’ most crowded areas, this is the nightlife area of this belt, especially around Sunset strip. Home to UCLA, Tiffany theatre, Los Angeles Film School, Beverly Hills Hotel, famous guitar stores and many other popular hotels and buildings, the Sunset Boulevard is never short on action. Venice Beach One of LA’s most popular beaches, the Venice beach packs its own retro character. With beach shacks and an hipster look, it is a classic beach getaway. The famous Muscle Beach is located here. And its proximity to Santa Monica gives it great access. Grammy Museum If you are a music buff, you should definitely pay a visit to the Grammy Museum. This place lives and breathes music. Located in downtown LA, this place holds exhibits that explore the greatest GRAMMY music, everything from rock to hip hop to country, classical, Latin, R&B and Jazz. Staples Center Home of four professional sports franchises, NBA’s LA Lakers and LA Clippers, NHL’s Los Angeles Kings and WNBA’s Los Angeles Spark, Staples Center is definitely the sports and entertainment center of this region. If you wish to sample local culture, then you definitely have to catch a live game here. Do check out their events calendar as they might be hosting anything from professional sporting events, live music shows, family shows and other special events while you are holidaying in LA.
