Bringing the event dedicated to the meetings, events and incentive industry to Nashville follows the success of ibtm america 2015 where over 5,200 pre-scheduled appointments were mutually matched for both suppliers and buyers in a closed show environment that mixed business with networking and education. Exhibitors averaged 29 appointments over the course of 2.5 days. \n“The excitement behind delivering our event in different key convention cities in the US adds variety and new experiences for all our attendees. Nashville is one of the hottest convention cities in America right now and whilst its very roots are in music (the Country Music Hall of Fame) there is also history, the arts, food – the city recently was nominated in the top 10 best BBQ cities in the US – and of course a variety of venues to benefit this industry. We will be there in one of its best months (June) and no doubt the town will be buzzing,” said Jaime McAuley, Event Director, ibtm america. Taking place from June 15-17, ibtm america will be held at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, the flagship property of Gaylord Hotels. Just 10 minutes from Nashville International Airport and easily accessible to Music City, the Gaylord is known as the largest exhibition and meetings venue in continental US. Some of its facts and figures include 2,882 guest rooms onsite, 6 ballrooms, more than 100 technologically advanced conference and breakout rooms, some 600,000 sq ft of meeting, convention and exhibit function space and 4.5 acres of tropical gardens under glass with a river running through it. “There is no doubt that ibtm america will deliver not only another successful business event, but it will also deliver a real experience for all of our attendees. We fully expect many will want to either arrive early or stay on to make the most of the facilities, whether it’s to spend more time in downtown Nashville or at the Gaylord as this resort is certainly one of a kind in the USA,” added McAuley. ibtm america 2016 will once again feature the all inclusive innovative pod design where exhibitors pay one price for a modular booth design ready on arrival for them to start the business of meetings. Tina Gerson, Director of National Accounts at The Diplomat Hotel Florida summed up her experience as an exhibitor at this year’s event, \"First experience of an ibtm event. I love the meeting pod concept, it takes it to another level compared to other shows. I loved the appointment system - everyone matched and I didn't need to even ask. I probably have a dozen solid leads from ibtm america and if just one books, it will have paid for my meeting pod! I would say 90% of hosted buyers who met with me had specific business for the future. I am looking forward to coming to Nashville in 2016!\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T11:53:39.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
