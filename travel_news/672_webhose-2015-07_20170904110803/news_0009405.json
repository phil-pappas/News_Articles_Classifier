You leave an urban area behind and, within minutes, are transported to a stunning and unspoilt corner of the UK. Studland is one of my favourite places on the south coast, and today I am walking a much-loved route – a loop from the village that offers spectacular cliff views. It starts in woodland which drops gently down to South Beach, where the sheltered waters of Shell Bay lap the sand. The sun breaks through the clouds over the iconic Old Harry Rocks, lighting up the water at its base, while a ferry heading for France slowly disappears around the headland. A path fringed by meadow brings me to Old Harry. I’m rewarded with the sun highlighting the layers and crags of the chalk. Seagulls cry out and swifts swoop around these magnificent sea stacks. I turn west and soon there’s a lookout point from which to enjoy Old Harry’s arch – where the sea churns – and, looking west, the jagged white teeth of the Pinnacles. At the top, there’s a breathtaking view of the channels and inlets of Poole Harbour, and Bournemouth’s beach sweeping away in the distance The walk progresses along Old Nick’s Ground, slowly rising to a crest of downland which is made all the more beautiful when accompanied by the mellow warbling of a bird overhead. I reach the lip of the hill and there’s the curl of Swanage Bay. A bank of brooding grey cloud and a strong southwesterly hints at rain. After a downhill trek along the Purbeck Way, I’m climbing up Ballard Down. At the top, there’s a breathtaking view of the channels and inlets of Poole Harbour, and Bournemouth’s beach sweeping away in the distance. After a short, wind-battered stretch along Studland Hill, I’m descending in hot sunshine, those grey clouds long gone. The path crosses a cornfield before disappearing into woodland, the canopy of trees providing some welcome shade. I return to South Beach, where Joe’s Café is open for lunch. Home-made lemonade and spicy Jamaican patties are the perfect way to end an idyllic walk.
