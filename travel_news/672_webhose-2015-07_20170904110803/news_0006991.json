TheSuitest gained acclaim for applying Wall Street-style data analytics to the lodging market and joins the firm’s new technology innovation centre, ClickTripz Labs. \nWith the new addition, ClickTripz plans to unveil a number of joint innovations in the coming months, which leverage the proprietary technology developed at TheSuitest. This technology helps make sense of unstructured travel buying information, allowing businesses to gain insight into market dynamics and anticipate consumer behaviour online. The first product ClickTripz Labs is launching aims to dramatically increase conversion rates for travel suppliers and online travel agents (OTAs), using a mix of metasearch technology and machine-learning enhanced targeting. The product displays rates from other channels on supplier websites and OTAs, allowing consumers to easily compare prices, without leaving to check rates. Ross Weber, ClickTripz’s CEO states: “Mastering data management has always been an integral part of our business.” He continues: “With the acquisition of TheSuitest, we are doing more than just strengthening our internal data science capabilities – we are also extending that core competency to a new generation of tools and products for the online travel industry. These aim to help travel suppliers optimally sell their inventory.” “Whereas other travel tech companies have begun to diversify into different verticals, ClickTripz is taking a distinctly different tack, deepening its focus on travel data and integrated solutions for lodging suppliers,” Weber concludes. As part of the acquisition, TheSuitest team will join ClickTripz at its Manhattan Beach, CA, headquarters to spearhead new product initiatives. Co-Founder of TheSuitest, Jeremy Murphy confirms: “Joining ClickTripz was an obvious choice for us.” “This is a special opportunity to combine our cutting-edge, data-crunching machinery with an established travel technology firm that has a track record of creating win-win solutions for suppliers, publishers, advertisers and consumers,” says Murphy.
