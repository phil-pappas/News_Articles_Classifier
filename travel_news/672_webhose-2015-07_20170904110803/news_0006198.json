Both the first and second placegetters out of Sunday’s race are expected to line up in Thursday week’s $85,000 feature.\nOriginally published as Veteran adds another Cup to collection", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/superracing/jockey-robert-thompson-adds-sawtell-cup-to-growing-collection/story-fni2gg7e-1227457833748"], "published": "2015-07-27T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:19:25.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
