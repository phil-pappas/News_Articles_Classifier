IATA attacked the decision to allow Aeroports de Paris to increase charges for every year between 2016 and 2020, with CEO Tony Tyler warning that it would mean air travellers having to “reach deeper into their wallets to travel to, from and within France”. “Making it more expensive at a time when improving competitiveness is a fundamental concern just does not add up,” added Tyler. “Every business that in any way relies on global markets takes a hit as well. I urge the government to reconsider.” An independent commission to look into charges at Charles de Gaulle and Orly had recommended that the two airports should use money from its retail facilities to reduce charges each year up to 2020. But this has been ignored. “It is deeply disappointing that the government chose to ignore this golden opportunity for a winning solution in favour of a decision that will make travel more expensive for French business and tourism,” said Tyler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:08:29.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
