Tourists wanting to flag down an Uber taxi in Los Angeles, California, may be subject to arrest if not using the Uber app on their cell phone. Uber taxi drivers in downtown Los Angeles say they were entrapped by city police during a recent sting that involved women pleading for rides. \nThe drivers – Roy Freeman, Michael Chadwick, and Sid Lomeli, all who have near-perfect Uber records – told CBS Los Angeles that their separate arrests on Friday night occurred after an insistent woman flagged them down. The drivers believe they were targeted because of the “U” on their windshield identifying them as Uber drivers. \nThey said they believed the woman might have just used the online app to call a taxi. Yet the woman did not have the Uber app and stressed that she needed a ride. \nThe Los Angeles Department of Transportation told CBS Los Angeles that ride-share drivers are subject to arrest if they pick up anyone who has not arranged for a ride via the online app. \nFreeman said the woman “vigorously waved” at him for a ride. The woman refused to take no for an answer, the drivers said. \nPolice pounced quickly after the woman entered each driver’s car, arresting each individual and impounding their vehicles. \nA Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson told LAist that the department did not have any information to offer regarding the arrests. \nAn Uber spokesperson told LAist that it was following up on the incidents. \nThe drivers said they feel they were treated unfairly. Their clean driving records suggest they never offer unsolicited rides, they said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:12:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
