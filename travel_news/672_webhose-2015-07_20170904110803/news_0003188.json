There is coconut water, oil, milk and flour. Even though the coconut craze in the U.S. is fairly recent, Southeast Asian cooks have been using coconut practically forever.\nNow that we are on the bandwagon, coconut curry lovers can rejoice. Finally, we can find canned unsweetened coconut milk in our grocery stores with ease.\nWhat’s more, companies are mass-producing curry pastes, which were once made only by home cooks.\nToday’s recipe for Sweet Potato and Chicken Curry serves two to three people; it can easily be doubled for a larger crowd. If you are a smaller household, leftovers are divine.\nLight coconut milk works best, as the flavors are gentle. Be sure to shake the canned milk well before adding it to the chicken and vegetables, as it tends to separate quickly. As written, this curry is mild, but you can add more curry paste to fire it up.\nThis is sure to become a favorite in your kitchen, just like it has in mine.\nSWEET POTATO AND CHICKEN CURRY\n2\nteaspoons vegetable oil\n1\nmedium sweet potato, for about 1 1/2 cups peeled cubes\n1\nlarge onion, peeled and coarsely chopped\n3\ncloves garlic, chopped\n8\nounces skinless boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1\n(15-ounce) can unsweetened light coconut milk\n1\nteaspoon red curry paste or more to taste\n1/4\nteaspoon ground cumin\nCooked brown rice, for serving\nFresh cilantro leaves, to taste\nIn a large nonstick skillet or pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the sweet potatoes and onions; stir and cook until potatoes and onions begin to brown on the edges. Add garlic and chicken, and stir and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Chicken will still be partially pink, which is fine.\nAdd the coconut milk and stir in the red curry paste and cumin. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover the pot. Stirring only occasionally, simmer until chicken is fully cooked through, about 30 minutes.\nServe over brown rice and sprinkle each serving with cilantro to taste. Makes 2 to 3 servings.\nPER SERVING (analyzed for 3 servings, no rice): Calories 286 (50% from fat), Fat 16 g (9 g sat), Cholesterol 44 mg, Sodium 144 mg, Fiber 2 g, Carbohydrates 18 g, Protein 18 g", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:42:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
