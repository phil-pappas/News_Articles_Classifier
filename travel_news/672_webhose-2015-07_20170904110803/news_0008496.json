They kick up quickly, turning friendly seas dangerous in mere minutes.\n“Had they been out over the open water, they could have had some rapidly changing conditions,” said John Pendergrast, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne, about the two 14-year-olds who have been missing since Friday. “It’s too hard to say whether weather directly could have caused whatever it is that happened to them, but there were some localized wind gusts and precipitation.”\nPendergrast said it’s not surprising at all that the boat was found more than 60 miles off Daytona Beach. The strong Gulf Stream current would carry the boat that far.\nOff the coast of Palm Beach County, the warm river of water picks up speed as it is squeezed through a channel created between the Bahamas and the Florida coast. The pace picks up to about 3-and-half miles per hour and stays swift until it reaches Daytona Beach, said Dmitry Dukhovski, associate scientist of physical oceanography for Florida State University.\n“They should be in the Gulf Stream,” said Dukhovski. “They probably wouldn’t even know they were caught in it because in the ocean, you can’t feel the motion.”\nOfficials are still searching for the boys, but the weather, again, may be a factor. While the morning will remain still, storms are expected this afternoon.\n“There’s not too much out there at the moment, but chances things will change increase in the afternoon,” Pendergrast said.\n</span", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:32:53.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
