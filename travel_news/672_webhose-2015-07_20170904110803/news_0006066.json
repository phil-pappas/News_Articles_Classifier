James Martin \nIf you're even planning on a trip to Italy, no doubt you've heard folks talk about the shakerato. While a \"shakerato\" can mean lots of drinks shaken, usually alcoholic ones, the caffe shakerato is the latest craze associated with trying to beat the summer heat. Nothing like ice and caffeine to knock out the summer doldrums. \nIn its most simple form, a caffe shakerato is made by combining freshly made espresso, a bit of sugar, and lots of ice, shaking the whole deal vigorously until a froth forms when poured. You can do this in a martini shaker at home. \nBut Italian bars, especially ones with those fancy printed menus on the tables outside, will juice up the common caffe shakerato. The picture above shows a caffe shakerato poured into a wine glass that has been lined with a spiral of chocolate syrup. Some add or substitute vanilla gelato for the ice. Some add booze. Some add cream. \nMartini glasses or champagne flutes are the traditional glassware used to hold a caffe shakerato. \nCaffe shakerato is pronounced as you might expect, sort of ca-fay shake-er-a-to. \nIn an Italian bar or cafe, you can also order Caffe freddo, cold coffee that can also be iced or even frozen. It will be very, very, sweet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:55:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
