Demand has been enabled by a robust and competitive marketplace in which capacity has been added and average fares have decreased. This competitive landscape has greatly benefited air travel consumers.\" The lawsuit follows the U.S. Department of Justice’s announcement last week of an investigation into collusion within the airline industry . The DOJ requested information that could indicate airlines are purposefully slowing growth to raise airfares. Both American and Southwest released statements last week, confirming their cooperation in the investigation. The lawsuit states that the five plaintiffs, including Jonathan Shankle of South Carolina, are seeking treble damages and prohibition of price-fixing in the future. The plaintiffs all bought airline tickets from one or more of the named airlines in the past five years. “The defendants are so intent on raising profits that they appear to have colluded to gouge customers’ pocketbooks and keep airfares sky high,” Warren Burns , an attorney with Burns Charest LLP and plaintiff representative, said in a news release. “Agreeing to restrict capacity to keep your profits high marks the very definition of an antitrust violation.” The Dallas filing follows at least two similar passenger lawsuits filed in Chicago and New York in the days since the news of the DOJ's investigation. The Chicago case specifically seeks to represent all passengers who purchased tickets for domestic flights between October 1, 2012, and now, Bloomberg reported. Over the weekend, Doug Parker , American's chairman and CEO, sent a message to the company's employees to reassure them about the DOJ's probe : “On behalf of your entire leadership team, let me be crystal clear: there has been no illegal behavior on the part of American Airlines,” Parker wrote, according to the Dallas Morning News . “We will comply fully with the demands of the CID and this fact will be proven.” Parker previously has been vocal about what he sees as the need of the airline industry to avoid increasing flight capacity in order to protect profits . \nWant Charlotte Legal Services news in your inbox?
