PATERSON – Standing in front of about 30 children in a basement classroom at School 21, local rapper Tyrus Odom-Holly offered a simple message. “No smoking,” he told them.\nBut this wasn’t a speech about the ills of tobacco. The 23-year-old was talking about a different smoke – the type that comes from a fired gun.\n“We’ve got to put the guns down and stop the violence in Paterson,” said Odom-Holly, who is 23 and lives in the 1st Ward. “We need to do positive things in the community.”\nThe youngsters listened respectfully and applauded when Odom-Holly finished talking. Then they returned to their summer camp games.\nOdom-Holly, who performs as the rapper \"Young Mike,\" visited one of the camps run by the city’s Jump Start community group last week in an effort to launch his anti-violence “No Smoking” campaign.\n“They have to learn that guns is not a way of life,” said Jamie Bland, Jump Start’s director.\nBland and Odom-Holly said they are also writing the script of a film about the violence that plagues Paterson.\nThe “No Smoking” grassroots campaign is in its infancy. Odom-Holly has printed up about 50 t-shirts with a logo modeled after the one used in public places to tell people smoking tobacco is not permitted. But Odom-Holly’s logo features the silhouette of a handgun instead of a cigarette. He said he will produce t-shirts more after he gets some donations.\nJump Start runs seven camps and Odom-Holly will make the rounds this summer. After that, he plans to bring his message to other community groups.\nOdom-Holly was arrested for a robbery attempt when he was 15. Being jailed for two days was a life-changing experience, he said. Now, he said, he tries to avoid making music that glorifies guns, gangs, drugs and other negativity.\n\"We need positive energy,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_Tyrus"], "published": "2015-07-14T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:18:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
