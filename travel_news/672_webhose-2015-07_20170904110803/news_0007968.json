The schoolboy was placed on the Channel Project when he was aged just 13, after concerns were raised at his school. He had made Islamist threats, talked about Osama bin Laden and expressed his desire to be a jihadist. But efforts to divert him from radicalisation failed because 16 months later he was directing plans for a major terrorist atrocity in Australia from his bedroom. It calls in to question the effectiveness of the Government’s counter-radicalisation efforts at a time when a worrying number of young Muslims are being attracted by the lure of Isil. The Government is considering plans to force jihadists returning from Syria to go through counter-radicalisation programmes as a condition of being allowed back in the UK. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted inciting Australian teenagers to attack the Anzac Day parade in Melbourne when he appeared at the Old Bailey via videolink. • Islamist extremists in prison 'revolving door' as numbers soar The cell was to drive in to crowds and behead a policeman but were foiled when police in the UK discovered messages between the youngster and his Australian contact. The fact someone so young almost successfully organised what would have been a horrific terrorist attack has sent shock waves through the police and security services. But the Daily Telegraph can disclose the boy, who has poor vision and is almost blind in one eye, was flagged up as a risk at an even younger age. Police were called to his school in 2013 amid concerns over his erratic behaviour and threats he had made which had an Islamist theme. • Schoolboy obsessed with drawing bomb picture reported to anti-terror scheme He was referred to the Channel project in November of that year but it is understood to have had little impact on him. In March 2015 he was arrested by counter-terrorism police as part of an ongoing investigation and then rearrested the following month when officers uncovered the Australia plot. He is the second convicted terrorist this year where counter-extremism programmes did not work. In February, 19-year-old Brusthom Ziamani was found guilty of plotting to behead a British soldier in an echo of the brutal murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Ziamani was arrested in an east London street last August carrying a black flag, a 12in (30cm) knife and a hammer in a rucksack, having earlier researched the location of Army cadet bases in the south east of the capital. He was only caught by chance when a counter-terrorism officer who knew him became suspicious when he spotted him out of his normal area. It emerged at his trial that two months earlier he had been placed on the Government’s Prevent programme but had rejected any attempts to confront his rapidly growing Islamist views. • Extremism unchecked in schools, secret briefing reveals Critics of the Government’s Prevent strategy claim it is ineffective and have called for an overhaul. The Channel Project was set up following the 7/7 attacks in 2005 and aims to identify people vulnerable to extremism. It then engages appropriate agencies to address their behaviour and keep them away from danger. It can include work with schools, social services, police, health and local councils. Figures in 2013 showed there had been 2,653 referrals since its inception, including 645 aged 12 to 16 and another 113 were aged under 12. In one case, a three year old child was involved because an entire family was referred. Previous cases have included a teenage schoolboy in East Lancashire who was referred for regularly drawing bombs and guns. Another youngster wrote “I want to be a suicide bomber” in a school book. Others reported were new neighbours behaving oddly, including keeping their curtains shut, a bus passenger expressing racist views and a vulnerable loner who suddenly gained new friends. The police chose to take no further action in those cases. Of the 2,653 referrals, 67 per cent was associated with Islamist extremism and 14 per cent, or 371 cases, involved far right extremism. Police and other agencies took further action in 587 cases after assessing the individuals were vulnerable. @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:44:18.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
