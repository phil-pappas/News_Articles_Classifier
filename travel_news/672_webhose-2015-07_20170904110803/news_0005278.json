Now 13 years after her first ski lesson while travelling through Andorra on a family holiday, Gallagher has returned as Visit Andorra Ambassador.“We went back for three or four years on family holidays then I visited in March this year and the skiing was even better than I remembered,” Gallagher recalled. She also had special praise for the adaptive snowsports facilities that the Andorran resorts offer. “The Arinsal Ski School in the Vallnord region has English-speaking instructors and is particularly good for those with special needs.”For Gallagher one of Andorra’s highlights is its year-round appeal. “Unlike some resorts in France that are purpose-built for skiing, people actually live there and there are events to draw you all year round.” This summer visitors can enjoy free open-air performances of Cirque du Soleil (until August 1) for the third year in a row; the UCI World Championship Mountain Bike and Trials are coming in September; the FIS Women’s Alpine Ski World Cup takes place next February; and the Tour de France will pass through for three days in summer 2016.Gallagher said there were plenty of activities off the slopes to keep visitors occupied too. “On my visit in March we tried husky dog-sledding, which was fantastic. We also tried snowshoeing and ice skating - I really enjoyed those snow-based, non-skiing activities.”Away from the snow and ice, visitors can also enjoy wellness centres such as Caldea, tax-free shopping and Gallagher’s personal favourite, the local food and wine.“When I visited as a 17-year-old I don’t think I hugely appreciated it, but on my visit in March I was blown away by the delicious meats and wine we tried in local restaurants. The tapas was especially tasty,” she said. And Gallagher’s favourite thing about the country? “It has to be the laid-back atmosphere and welcoming locals. Now I just need to push on with learning the Catalan language,” she admitted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T04:39:56.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
