Many parents are busy planning summer study tours for their kids, giving them a great learning experience overseas. But today, 40 students from different schools chose to visit a real aircraft and facilities at the Hong Kong International Airport, and had a fun and valuable experience with Hong Kong Airlines by joining the 8th “Triumph Sky High” Junior Programme. It is at the same time an English Writing Competition for “Junior Reporters” and “Little Journalists” from Young Post, the South China Morning Post’s supplement for young readers. Winners of this competition can get free round-trip air tickets to Taipei and travel with their friends and family.\nAs a special summer programme for kids, Hong Kong Airlines partnered with Young Post to recruit young reporters from different primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, giving them an opportunity to gain first-hand experience about flight operations. Students were divided into two groups, “Junior Reporters” for secondary students and “Little Journalists” for primary students. These young reporters had to showcase their talents and turn their extraordinary visit into an article. Hong Kong Airlines together with Young Post editor will pick the best article from each group and two prize-winning students will be awarded two sets of Taipei round-trip tickets.\nMr. Michael Burke, Assistant Director of Commercial Department of Hong Kong Airlines, said, “Over 300 students have joined Hong Kong Airlines ‘Triumph Sky High’ Junior Programme so far and we would like to make the 8th visit more special. So we host the “Triumph Sky High” English Writing Competition. Besides offering students exposure to the aviation industry and help nurture more aviation talents, we hope to cultivate youngsters’ interest in writing, and encourage them to explore the world and express their thoughts through writing.”\nThe aviation experience programme began with a visit to Hong Kong Airlines’ catering service centre and check-in counters at the Hong Kong International Airport. Students were taken behind the scenes to learn how meals are prepared and the daily operation of ground services. Led by pilots and flight attendants, the students were then taken onboard a Hong Kong Airlines A330 aircraft and entered the cockpit for the first time. They also experienced Business Class facilities and tried on life jackets. Some students even got dressed as flight attendants and performed inflight duties in the aircraft cabin which has just entered into the list of top 10 “World’s Best Aircraft Cabin Cleanliness” by Skytrax. Those who got the chance to wear pilot uniform and learn with areal captain at cockpit found the visit very exciting and expressed the wish of becoming a pilot when they grow up.\nHong Kong Airlines will continue to hold the “Triumph Sky High” Junior Programme later this year to offer more students the exposure to the aviation industry.\nDetails of Hong Kong Airlines “Triumph Sky High” Junior Programme\nAge Primary 5 to Secondary 3 students Quota of Application 20-40 Participants for each activity Details To visit Hong Kong Airlines catering service centreTo experience the ground service and observe their daily operation To get into the aircraft cockpit, learn about cabin services and how to wear a lifejacket Application Methods All primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong are welcome, please send the application by email tocorpcomm@hkairlines.com Application Fee Free\nSource:- Hong Kong Airlines\nTags: Hong Kong Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:11:05.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
