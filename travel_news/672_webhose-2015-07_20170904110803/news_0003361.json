The Colosseum. Source: Supplied \nIT’S regarded as the birthplace of Western civilisation, a city rich with culture and steeped in history. \nBut Rome, the Eternal City, is on the “verge of collapse”. \nDespite being one of the ten biggest cities in Europe, receiving more than 10 million foreign visitors annually, the city almost went bankrupt last year. \nThe streets are a shambles, basic services in tatters and the main airport is partially closed. \nNot only that but a European Commission survey from 2013 ranked Rome last out of 28 EU capitals for the efficiency of city services. \nAnd despite its fine cuisine and sunny climate, Rome came second to last for quality-of-life satisfaction. Athens was bottom. \n“Rome is on the verge of collapse,” Giancarlo Cremonesi, the president of the Rome Chamber of Commerce, told Reuters . “It is unacceptable that a major city which calls itself developed can find itself in such a state of decay.” \nYears of neglect, corruption and bureaucratic bungling have taken its toll on this beautiful city which boasts the Colosseum, the Spanish Steps, the Pantheon and the Trevi Fountain. \nWhile the major attractions continue to be restored (Trevi Fountain received $4.27 million makeover last year) the rest of the city is in a state of disrepair.

There is also ridiculous road configurations and even the emergence of rickshaws around popular tourist attractions. \nMany are disgusted by homelessness in the city. Italy is in the midst of a migrant crisis with thousands of asylum seekers pouring into the country every month. Many try to make their way to other European countries, while others remain stuck in Rome after either being sent back or unable to leave. \nBecause they have nowhere to live, makeshift camps pop up in parks and piazzas across the city.Local authorities and police try to clear the areas by moving the migrants on, however they return a few days later because they have nowhere else to go. \nDavvero incredibile a Piramide... \nIn the post below locals joke how even public transport has suffered, describing this bus stop as a jungle and that even Tarzan lives there. \nSta diventando la normalità. Posted by Roma fa schifo on Thursday, July 16, 2015 \n“It has got a lot worse in the last few years,” Costanza Cagni, who has lived in the city since 2000, told The Telegraph . \n“Everybody moans but nobody offers any solutions. The quality of life has really gone down. I’m sorry to say it, but I just want to leave Rome and move somewhere else.” \nMost blame the neglect on disorganised government and the high level of corruption. \nIn December, Italy was rocked by a major scandal involving the Mafia and those at the top of Roman politics. \nWhile the country is no stranger to corrupt politicians, the perceived influence of the Mafia was thought to have been more in the south of the country. \nThe “Mafia Capitale” revelations have shown that organised crime is well and truly entrenched within the walls of Rome’s city hall. \nLast year it emerged Rome was in debt to the tune of 14 billion euro (A$20.59 billion) but was rescued by state emergency funds. \nWiretap transcripts from the scandal revealed mobsters had siphoned off millions of euros from a string of lucrative contracts, covering everything from recycling paper to sheltering immigrants, Reuters reported. \nMuch of the alleged corruption dates back to the previous mayor, Gianni Alemanno, a former right-wing minister who is under investigation. He denies any wrongdoing. \nJust this week, police raided a restaurant close to the Pantheon on suspicion that it was controlled by the ‘Ndrangheta’, the Calabrian mafia, The Telegraph reported.

Source: Supplied \nWhile current Mayor Ignazio Marino has not been implicated in the ‘Mafia Capitale’ scandal, some of his staff have come under scrutiny, leading to a stream of resignations. \nA Rome city hall source told Reuters an official review had recommended that around 30 major public contracts be annulled and re-offered for tender. \nMayor Marino was quoted in the Corriere della Sera newspaper saying Rome’s public administration was “substantially rotten”, according to Reuters. \n“There is strenuous resistance to any type of change (here) ... but I will never give up,” he reportedly wrote in the paper. \nNext year the Italian capital is set to be inundated with 25 million pilgrims answering Pope Francis’s call for an extraordinary Holy Year -- one of the Roman Catholic Church’s most important events. \nThe mayor’s office has yet to layout its strategy for coping with the influx, or earmark any funds to cover the cost. \nIt has put together a 500-strong taskforce of employees and volunteers to help clean up Rome’s neglected green spaces but for some it may not be enough. \n“The prayers of the pope will not be enough. Here we need a miracle from the lord above for Rome to emerge in good shape,” Chamber of Commerce chief, Cremonesi said. \nOnly time will tell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T15:54:36.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
