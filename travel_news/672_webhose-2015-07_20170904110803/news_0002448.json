And these are the beautiful photographs she took while she was there.\nDespite being warned against travelling to Pakistan as a solo female traveller, Teo Jioshvili found the Badshahi mosque to be one of the most beautiful she'd ever seen\nThe intrepid traveller, who aspires to be a travel photographer, first got the idea to visit after a trip to Iran.\n It's all about Location, Location, Location: Phil Spencer...

'Their stories inspired me.'\nAnd despite her family's warnings, she opted to travel to the conflicted country as a solo female traveller.\n'I always stay positive, try to appreciate the traditions and culture where I go, smile a lot and I know that everything will be okay,' she says.\n'Actually, I felt very protected in Pakistan.'\nThis is one of Jioshvili's favourite photographs: of a street artist in front of a wall he was working on\nThe 29-year-old analyst also reveals that she loves taking photographs of children when she travels\nOn her first night in Lahore, she was invited to a local wedding - one of her favourite memories of the trip\nShattering any preconceived notions Jioshvili may have had, she found the people to be extremely friendly.\n'I was often stopped on the streets and in Bazaars someone would ask me to take a picture of him or her with me,' she says. 'Most of the time, people would just give me an apple or an orange.\n'That was just very sweet.'\nIf ever any men asked to take a photo with her, they were always extremely respectful\nThough she was often stopped while there, most people simply wanted to take a photo or give her a gift\nThe strange food, which was available for purchase on the street, was another trip highlight\nAt the Badshahi Mosque, which boasts intricately designed walls, many visit to take part in prayer rituals\nJioshvili explored the Badshahi Mosque extensively, photographing it both during the day and at sunset\nJioshvili enjoyed photographing the women and children of the city - in particular, their eyes\nOne particularly welcoming moment that stands out for her occurred when she first arrived at the Lahore Backpackers Hostel.\n'One German girl invited me to join her and go to a wedding party,' she remembers.\n'The day before, that girl had met a ricksha (tuk-tuk) driver who was a friend of the drummer's and those guys were invited to the wedding to play music.\n'Of course I said yes, left my backpack in reception and went with them.\n'The whole experience was just amazing.'\nThough at first people were wondering who the strangers at the reception were, the girls were soon invited to take place in the traditional ceremony.\nShe says: 'The whole wedding party was just an incredible experience with its music, traditions, smiling and curious faces, women in colourful dresses. I am just very happy that I said \"yes\" to that girl.'\nDuring her time in Lahore, Jioshvili was keen to document all of her experiences\nOne of the best things about visiting Pakistan? All of the bright colours everywhere!\nJioshvili fell in love with Lahore's adorable children (left) and the city's incredibly delicious street food (right)\nDuring her time there, she went to Wagah border and watched the Flag lowering ceremony\nOn the whole, Jioshvili never felt that she was in danger during her time spent there.\n'Of course there are places in Pakistan that aren't recommended for travellers,' she says. 'But I felt absolutely safe in Lahore.'\nAnd for evidence of her once-in-a-lifetime trip, just take a peek at all of the breathtaking photographs.\n'I enjoy taking pictures while travelling because it's a perfect way to show my friends and family what I'm experiencing when I'm there,' she explains.\n'Photos are the best souvenirs for me, so I snap everything around me.\n'I love to photograph children, as they have really poor emotions in their eyes.'\nAmong her favourite images are the portraits of the Pakistani street artist and street girls, though she notes that men would never ask her to take photos with them if she was alone.\n'If there was another male (another traveler or guide) with me, they would ask him for the permission to take a photo with me. I think that was a really beautiful sign of appreciation.'\nTwo boys study the Quran in this candid shot, which Jioshvili took while travelling through Lahore\nBreak time! A spice-selling street vendor takes a break to read the morning paper in Lahore, Pakistan\nLahore Fort, a citadel in the Walled City, was another stop during Jioshvili's travels\n'Badshai Mosque is just one of the most impressive heritage sites that I've ever visited,' she tells MailOnline\nThis sweet photo depicts families of school children heading into class for lessons\nAlthough Lahore is a huge city, Jioshvili always felt like if she got lost, someone would try to help her\n'For me, travel is not just about sightseeing, it's about experiences, people who I meet and things that I learn while travelling,' she says.\n'Badshai Mosque is just one of the most impressive heritage sites that I've ever visited, but probably what I loved most about Pakistan was that it surprised me.\n'I did not expect that it would be so easy to get around Lahore.\n'People were so generous and friendly that I was really impressed.\n'Lahore is a huge city, but I was never lost and I always knew if I got lost that someone would definitely help me, which is a very important feeling especially when you are a lone female traveller.\n'Also, I must say that Pakistan really has the most delicious street food I've ever tried. And it's very very colourful. I love that.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1HM066Y"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:59:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
