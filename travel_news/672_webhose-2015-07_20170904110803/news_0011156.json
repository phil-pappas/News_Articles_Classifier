Lufthansa’s June 2 announcement was made without any prior consultation and represents a step backwards for Iata agents moving away from easy connectivity, transparency and comparability of integral systems, resulting in additional time and cost to make bookings. Abta will continue to work with its members to keep them informed of any developments”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:24:40.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
