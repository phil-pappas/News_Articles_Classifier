For instance, Earl’s Regency, a hilltop retreat located in the town of Kandy boasts average prices that start at just S$208. \n\nIndia and Malaysia follow closely behind with average rates at S$243 and S$244 respectively. Hong Kong has the most expensive five-star hotels with average rates at S$461. \n\nDebby Soo, Kayak’s vice president APAC, believes that travelling on a budget does not mean completely ignoring luxurious hotels. \n\n“To find a less expensive, but still amazing, five-star resort, look for destinations that are outside mega-popular tourist areas. Hotels in less-frequented destinations like Kuala Lumpur and Kochi provide the same amount of luxury for less,” said Soo in a press release announcing the findings. \n\nKayak’s full list of countries and their corresponding average nightly rate is as seen below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T10:41:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
