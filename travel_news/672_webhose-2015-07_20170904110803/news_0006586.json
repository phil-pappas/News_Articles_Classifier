It stretches from the snow capped Himalayas to tropical greenery and many diverse landscapes in between. It's a huge country often referred to as a subcontinent and the second most populated country in the world with over one billion inhabitants. Experiencing India The best time to visit India is between late October (the end of the monsoon season) and the end of March. Economy flights will cost around Â£500 but shop around for the best available prices. No matter how long your vacation is it will not be long enough to see everything, with that in mind it's a good idea to plan your itinerary in advance. Of course many people go on a package tour and they are plentiful and easy to book but will work out more expensive than planning your own itinerary and booking hotels and travel online. Do remember, especially if you are planning your own trip, to include comprehensive travel insurance . Most people on their first visit will start in the capital New Delhi and this is a good place to begin your Indian adventure. New Delhi is part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. It is connected to the state of Uttar Pradesh which translates into English as Northern Province, it is a very popular place for tourists, including as it does the magnificent Taj Mahal at Agra a seemingly must visit attraction if you're going to India, and other glorious Mughal forts and mausoleums in North India's golden triangle of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. Of course a visit must include the holy Ganges River and the city of Varanasi regarded as the spiritual capital of India, it is a magnet for pilgrims who come to bathe in the Ganges and visit some of its two thousand temples including Kashi Vishwanath, the Golden Temple, dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva. All this in Uttar Pradesh which just goes to show how vast a country India is.
