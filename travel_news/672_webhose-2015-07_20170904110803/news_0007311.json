A hybrid between a golf cart and a surf board, the GolfBoard offers golfers an opportunity to carve the fairways and get an incredible workout while enjoying a round.\n“Introducing something exciting and fun to our guests and members was our hope, and the GolfBoards were a home run,” says Director of Golf Paul Earnest. “We are thrilled with this partnership and look forward to adding more GolfBoards to our fleet in the future.”\nWinner of “Best New Product” at the 2014 PGA Merchandise Show and co-founded by surfing icon Laird Hamilton, GolfBoards serve the next generation of golfers with their ease of use and innovative design. GolfBoards are operated by a thumb throttle that is attached to a stability bar and handle. The boards drive at a maximum of 10 miles per hour and offer a mounting for a golf bag and cup holder – the perfect ride for any golfer.\nSource:-Four Seasons\nTags: Hotel News , Surf the Earth on a GolfBoard at TPC Four Seasons in Dallas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:59:35.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
