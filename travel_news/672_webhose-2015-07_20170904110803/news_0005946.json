Yet this country’s northeastern coast along the Baltic Sea has long been a celebrated sun and sea destination.\nOn a recent trip to Berlin, photographer Michaela Urban and I hopped on a train for a pleasant ride north to the island of Rügen to see what the buzz was all about. Separated from the mainland by a mile-wide strait in the very north of Germany, this 357-square-mile island is where you’ll find many of Deutschland’s best Baltic Sea resorts and beaches.\nSassnitz Our first stop was the seaside fishing and port town of Sassnitz and Jasmund National Park. While not a large park (only 11 square miles), its dramatic white chalk cliffs, remote beaches and lush beech forests gained it a spot on the UNESCO World Heritage list.\nThe 7-mile coastline that runs along the park provides endless opportunities to find your own private picnic spot, where you can gaze out into the calm blue waters of the Baltic Sea and marvel at 500-foot-tall chalk cliffs towering above your head.\nThe cliffs are constantly eroding. With every storm, parts of the cliffs fall, exposing fossils of sponges, oysters and sea urchins. While searching for these ancient creatures, keep an eye out for examples of Rügen’s beautiful brown amber. The region is home to one of the largest known deposits of amber, called Baltic amber, which came from forests that existed here some 44 million years ago.\nJasmund is riddled with peaceful hiking trails where you can enjoy the park’s many rare trees and plants — such as black alder, European crab apple, wild service tree, yews and numerous members of the orchid family. Bird lovers should keep an eye out for white-tailed eagles, kingfishers, house martins and peregrine falcons.\nSassnitz has a mix of old and new architecture, including an ultramodern footbridge that takes tourists from the town on the cliff down to the port area.\nMake sure you stop in one of the brightly painted fishing boat/restaurants that float the harbor. They serve local seafood favorites, freshly caught and freshly cooked. Don’t wait until evening; most close down in the afternoon when they run out of the catch of the day.\nBinz For a more traditional seaside experience, nearby Binz is your spot. Bathing in the sea became very popular in the late 19th century, and as Binz has a beautiful long, sandy beach, this small fishing village became one of Germany’s most popular resort towns.\nInterestingly, few large hotels were built in Binz and the other resort towns along the Baltic coast during the heyday of construction. Most of the lodgings were built in a local villa style known as resort architecture, and many still exist. With their playful art nouveau elements, gingerbread trim and balconies made from wood or metal, they give Binz a quaint charm.\nOf the few larger hotels built here, likely the most famous and beautiful is the Kurhaus Binz — an elegant luxury spa hotel built in 1890. The structure suffered many ups and downs through the years, even serving as a convalescent home in the 1950s. It somehow survived the years, and in 2001 it got a complete face-lift. Located directly on the beach, it’s well worth checking out, even if you just stop in for lunch.\nThe beach at Binz, like most of the Baltic Sea beaches, is not exactly a Caribbean-like experience. The water is brackish and can be on the chilly side. Add to that a little wind and you’ll understand why most — if not all — Baltic beaches provide guests with special beach chairs called strandkorb (which in German means beach basket). These cozy, enclosed shelters protect you from the wind, rain, sun and sand, and they make a great place to curl up and enjoy a good book or take a nap.\nBe aware that this region was formerly East Germany, and East Germans are kind of known for being nudists. Some say it was one of the few freedoms they could exercise in an otherwise strict Soviet-controlled society. Whatever the cause, you will likely see a lot of naked bathers in these parts.\nSellin Further down the coast is another nice beach spot at Sellin, which you can access via an 87-step climb down a near-vertical cliff that takes you to the beach’s fabulous pier. As in Binz, you’ll see a lot of examples of resort architecture here, especially along the town’s famed Wilhelmstrasse.\nThe best way to see and experience these amazing Baltic Sea villages and beaches is cycling. We took the train to Rügen from Berlin and dragged our own bikes along (German rail is very bike friendly). Safe off-road bike paths run from Sassnitz to Binz and Sellin, along cliffs overlooking the sea. You’ll pass scenic farms and centuries-old villages. We even stumbled upon an ancient tomb dating from the middle Neolithic period; there are allegedly more than 200 scattered around Rügen.\nIf you’re looking for crystal blue waters, tropical breezes and palm trees, the Baltic Sea might not be your kind of beach experience. But if you’re interested in a seaside adventure full of Old World charm, dramatic vistas and beautiful rich landscapes, put Rügen on your list. If you combine it with a visit to nearby Stralsund, Berlin or Hamburg, you can’t lose.\nMichaela Urban and Eric Vohr have a travel website and blog at travelintense.com.\nWhen you go Find out about the region at ruegen.de/en/ueber-ruegen.html .", "external_links": ["http://ruegen.de/en/ueber-ruegen.html"], "published": "2015-07-18T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:24:10.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
