Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 27, 2015 Adv: \nOperations into the Masai Maraâ€™s airstrip in Keekorok, Kenya, last week were suspended due to the state of the runway. Since then, emergency repairs have been carried out and an inspection earlier allows for the resumption of flights effective July 28. \nMany nearby camps rely on this particular airfield to pick up and drop off clients and had to use other smaller and more distant airstrips, causing inconvenience and added cost. \nAs this decision has come at very short notice, Air Kenya has confirmed that clients who would wish to use the Keekorok airfield instead of the one they were confirmed, can be rebooked after notifying the airline ahead of their flight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:27:26.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
