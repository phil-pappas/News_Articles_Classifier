He led it to its most profitable year in 2014, surpassing $1 billion in revenue, up 13 percent from fiscal 2013. Last year, he managed capital projects and facility improvements totaling more than $71 million and 2015 capital projects expected to exceed $110 million, including the new Shipwreck Island water park at the Westgate Resorts Villas Resort & Spa in Kissimmee, creating 60 new water park jobs and 125 construction jobs. This year, he led the creation of a new technology for in-room hotel TV systems with a smartphone-to-TV interface enabling guests to stream content from their device to the TV in their room; and wrapped it with an app letting the guests carry hotel services with them, including valet notification, restaurant reservations and self check-in. In addition, last year the firm acquired the new Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino, and instead of closing the doors while spending $100 million to renovate it, Waltrip decided to keep it open — a costlier option with tougher logistics, in order to keep the resort’s thousands of workers employed during the renovations.

We service literally millions of families who save up their money all year round and trust us to deliver them a great vacation. I take it personally on those rare occasions when we don’t meet someone’s expectations. Personal insights Industry change I’d like to see : A better rating system for our industry to help educate consumers Toughest challenges in 2014: It was the best year in our company’s history. Our challenge is controlling our growth and not biting off more than we can digest. My best business decision in the past 12 months: Developing a system to ask our guests at the beginning of their vacation how we’re doing. Nothing is worse than finding out after someone left that we could have made their vacation better. Nothing makes me madder than: When I see something wrong and someone tells me, “This is how we always have done it.” Our guests don’t care what our policy is, they just want a great vacation. What I’d do with a $1 million windfall: Donate it to the new Victoria Siegel Memorial Foundation to help children with substance abuse challenges Thing that contradicts my executive image: I’m an accomplished chef and do most of the cooking in our house. Favorite app: Control-4. It controls my home automation system from anywhere. I’d like to learn: How to play the piano Memorable “aha” moment: My career took off when I learned to get paid doing what I enjoy. I started out as an aerospace engineer for the commercial space industry and ended up in the resort industry.
