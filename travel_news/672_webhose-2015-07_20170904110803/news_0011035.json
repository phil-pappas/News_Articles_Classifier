It's the closest airport to Manhattan, and a preferred landing spot for tourists and business travelers trying to visit New York City. \nAccording to US Vice President Biden, it's also the third largest world airport in the country. \n\"US Vice President Biden's fortuitously infamous and plainspoken assessment of LaGuardia has helped bring about a very favorable result,” said the US Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow. \nThe price tag for rebuilding New York's city closest airport will be 4 billion US dollars. This was proudly announced today by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. \nDow today reacted to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's announcement that he plans to completely rebuild LaGuardia Airport: \n“An investment in the long-term health of the airport that will pay massive benefits for the New York region and even cascade throughout the country. We thank the vice president for his candor, and we congratulate Gov. Cuomo for having the vision and courage to press ahead with this ambitious plan. Our hope is that this marks the beginning of a national conversation on the interconnectedness of America's economy with its airport infrastructure.\" \nThe airport, long considered cramped and overcrowded, will have 240% more space. \nNew connections to the airport, currently accessible by car and bus, will include a rail link and high-speed ferry. \nDelta Air Lines, which maintains a hub at the airport, has approved the plan and will rebuild its terminals. (The fate of the Marine Air Terminal, an official historic building, is unclear.) \nIt will be the first new airport built in the United States since the attacks of September 11, 2001. \nThe long-discussed project is expected to break ground in 2016 and take three years to complete—before the inevitable delays and cost overruns. “It is actually happening,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said in announcing the plan. \nDetailed renderings weren’t immediately available, but it appeared that LaGuardia’s runways would remain the same and the construction would happen around them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:27:23.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
