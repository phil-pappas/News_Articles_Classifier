Make the best use of those summer nights before they're gone: Summer Nights in Los Angeles : As you might expect, there are lots of fun ways to see a movie outside a night in LA, including in a cemetery or on a downtown rooftop Summer Nights in San Diego : You'll find lots of great concerts, an old-fashioned drive in movie theater and a \"dive in\" movie, too Summer Nights in San Francisco : How about a night time food fest or a theatre festival? Summer Outdoor Theatre in California : It's not all boring Shakespeare fests - and the surroundings can be so nice that you get distracted from the play Summer Outdoor Concerts in California : I love a balmy summer night at the Hollywood Bowl, but it doesn't end there. Take a look at these outdoor music fests that are worth a trip just to go Horse Racing at Del Mar.
