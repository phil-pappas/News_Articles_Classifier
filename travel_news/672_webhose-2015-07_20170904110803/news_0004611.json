Local Real Estate Cars For Sale \nYOUR boss has ticked off your holidays and you can almost taste the beachside cocktails already. \nNow there is just one pesky obstacle left to surmount: if you fail to save up a sizable kitty, it will have to be lemonades in the backyard. \nThe Australian Securities and Investment Commission says the average Australian household spends about $2700 a year on holidays, or $52 a week - So budgeting is essential. \nStarting a weekly holiday fund in a separate bank account with automatic debits on pay day is one of the best ways to avoid \"I'll make up for it next week\" syndrome. \nPlanning ahead and ensuring you get the best deals are also essential. \nAlways book travel in off-peak seasons if you are on a tight budget. \nAnother trap travellers often fall into is waiting too long to book their plane tickets, although booking too early can also be an issue. \nThe key is to aim for middle ground - unless you have no set date to travel on, in which case you can often snag a last-minute discount on available flights. \nAlso try to fly during the middle of the week instead of weekends, which are more popular and expensive. \nSharing accommodation costs with family and friends can often get you a group discount. \nAnother easily overlooked tip is to make sure everything electrical at home is switched off before you head away, to avoid paying for power you are not using. \nThere are all sorts of websites offering cheap and free travel options. \nOne of the most innovative is AussieHouseSwap.com.au that links up people who want to exchange houses (even cars, sometimes) for a set period. \nThey even have international house swap options, meaning you could potentially go to France and get free accommodation while someone looks after your home and feeds your dog. \nTOP STORIES ONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:18:41.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
