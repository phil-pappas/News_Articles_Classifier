The final-three field then was considered to be Walsh, Sydney assistant coach Stuart Dew and Hawthorn assistant Brendon Bolton.\n“Our circumstances are very different now,” Adelaide chief executive Andrew Fagan said yesterday.\nThe Crows last year hired Walsh — with his experience from a 20-year apprenticeship in AFL assistant coaching — to create change in a football program that had delivered mediocrity at West Lakes, with just one finals appearance in four seasons.\nNow they want a coach to continue — and advance — a “healthy football program” that is tagged as Walsh’s legacy.\nIf the Crows could get anyone, which coach would you prefer?\nThis does set up the prospect of Adelaide’s board being swept up in an emotional campaign from the fans for interim coach Scott Camporeale if he delivers the Crows to the AFL finals in September — and wins a final.\nThe comparable moment in AFL football is Sydney in 2002 when caretaker coach Paul Roos won the fans’ support with a 6-4 win-loss record — and the Swans’ hierarchy hired then Western Bulldogs coach Terry Wallace.\n“We won’t deal with the what-if debate,” Fagan said yesterday.\nAdelaide is repeating the process that led to Walsh’s appointment after last year’s AFL grand final — in particular respecting the anti-tampering theme of not derailing finals campaigns at rival clubs to rush an appointment at West Lakes.\nWalsh was not asked to formally present to the Adelaide selection panel until his work at Port Adelaide — as its midfield coach — was completed with the Power’s exit from the premiership race during the AFL preliminary finals.\n“And we will do that again,” Fagan said. “We will meet prospective candidates only with the permission of their current clubs — and with respect to their current obligations at those clubs.”\nWho do you think will be the next Crows coach?\nThis is regardless of Carlton — the other AFL club needing to find a senior coach after sacking Michael Malthouse — also being in the market and having earmarked candidates who would draw Adelaide’s interest.\nThe 18 AFL coaches last month unanimously endorsed a paper from the AFL Coaches’ Association that demands that from next year no coach nor assistant coach can be appointed — or interviewed without permission — until their work is completed for that season.\nWhile Adelaide’s search party — of Fagan, board member Mark Ricciuto, football chief David Noble and long-term football staffer Alan Stewart — will work to this anti-tampering theme, the process at West Lakes will not be delayed by working to a new AFL ethic.\nAdelaide will still be able to consult with managers to determine a coach’s interest in the Crows job. It also will be able to do its own research on a prospective candidate’s suitability for the Adelaide job.\nThe Crows have left open the prospect of hiring an experienced coach — or a novice with the support of an experienced coaching director, such as West Coast premiership coach John Worsfold who currently is on a short-term appointment to mentor Camporeale and his team.", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/8989451/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/8989451.js", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/8989441.js", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/8989441/"], "published": "2015-07-29T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T20:19:47.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
