Raúl Grijalva, has reintroduced bills that will restore and preserve Arizona public land citing economic and cultural benefits. The three different bills that were reintroduced include: the Sonoran Desert Heritage Act, the Southern Arizona Public Lands Protection Act and the Santa Cruz Valley National Heritage Area Act. These all mark the latest step in Grijalva's ongoing efforts to preserve natural and cultural resources throughout the state. Here is a breakdown of each bill: The Sonoran Desert Heritage Act: will preserve the ecology, cultural heritage, and recreational opportunities in the Sonoran Desert west of Phoenix. The bill establishes two National Conservation Areas and two Special Management Areas and adds 222,023 acres to the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Southern Arizona Public Lands Protection Act: withdraws, subject to valid existing rights, from all mineral laws the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land in Santa Cruz and Pima Counties. The biodiversity of the “Sky Islands” in the Southeastern Arizona are among the most threatened in North America by land development, climate change, poor livestock grazing practices, fire suppression, off-road vehicles and resource extraction. The Santa Cruz Valley National Heritage Area Act: would designate approximately 3,325 square miles of the Santa Cruz Valley as a National Heritage Area. Residents of the Santa Cruz Valley are looking to preserve and restore their architectural heritage and already celebrate the region’s cultural traditions at multiple museums, parks, and annual festivals. A number of rural communities in the area still contain thriving cattle ranches, farms, orchards, vineyards and copper mines. Grijalva said that Arizona regions rely on tourism, parks and publics lands. “The parks, public lands and trails throughout the state are not just an amenity – they’re part of our state’s cultural and historical fabric and make Arizona a great place to live,” Grijalva said. “Regions like the Santa Cruz Valley rely on tourism and offer educational programs that help educate the community about their heritage. We should never take these lands and historic sites for granted. Passing these bills means preserving our land and helping our state grow, both economically and culturally, and I look forward to their swift passage.” \nWant Phoenix Travel news in your inbox?
