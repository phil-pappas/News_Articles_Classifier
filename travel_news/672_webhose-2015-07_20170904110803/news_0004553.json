Here, Bruce remembers meeting the late great bluesman Albert King, physically fighting with Ginger Baker on stage and a reluctance to perform Cream songs just after the 1968 band breakup.\nJim Clash: We discussed Cream covering I’m So Glad and Crossroads, with Skip James and Robert Johnson, respectively, getting song-writing royalties. But not all artists are so lucky.\nJack Bruce: America is not very good to its great artists. America awards some people so vastly. Madonna, she’s good and everything, a great entertainer and I would not dream of putting that down. But there are a lot of other people, maybe better or more important in the long run, who must feel so badly that they don’t get the recognition. It’s difficult if you’re a white guy in a band, and a lot of what you do comes from that [African American blues] source. Eric [Clapton] had great success with I Shot The Sheriff, which I suppose helped [Bob] Marley get some recognition. But it works both ways. There have been bands – [Led] Zeppelin was accused of it, taken to court – that take [credited] things and call them “traditional.” If you have a traditional song, you can “arrange” it and then get royalties. With anything like that, I’m always very careful to trace it back as far as I can. Tracking some of those old things is very difficult.\nLate bassist Jack Bruce (left) with guitarist Leslie West (West, Bruce\nand Laing) said that just after Cream’s 1968 breakup, he shied away\nfrom performing Cream songs. (Courtesy of Wikipedia)\nJC: Have you ever met Albert King?\nJB: When I met Albert King the first time, I wanted him to play on a record. I was in San Francisco and went to where he was doing a club date. This is Albert King, you know, the most frightening blues man in the world [laughs]! He said hello, and then sort of said, “I never got the money.” I said, “What do you mean, you never got the money?” He said he never got [royalties] from Born Under A Bad Sign. But he didn’t write Born Under A Bad Sign! He’d obviously done it for so long he thought he did. It was quite new when Cream had recorded it, had just come out on an Albert King record. It’s not like he had been doing it for 20 years. He did get credit for [popularizing] it, but the real guys who wrote it were Booker T Jones and William Bell.\nJC: Was King joking about the money?\nJB: I think there was a certain amount of that. But with Albert King, you never really knew [laughs]. A scary guy, but a wonderful player. He played his guitar upside down and didn’t push the strings, he pulled them – quite incredible.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T06:27:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
