You know the drill, and it's OK — I did it too.\nI’ve been traveling with my eight-year-old daughter since she was 10 days old. And it has always been a complete pleasure because my daughter has been properly trained and I’m always prepared. But I also understand why travelers are apprehensive.\nAn informal poll done earlier this month by fivethirtyeight.com found that 82 percent of those surveyed felt that knowingly bringing an unruly child on an airline flight was rude. And no surprise here -- only 21 percent of parents with children thought \"bringing unruly children on a plane was `very rude,' compared to 47 percent of the 657 people without kids,\" according to the survey.\nSuzanne Rowan Kelleher, About.com's Family Vacations Expert, has some great tips for traveling with kids, including: book an early flight; navigate airports with the GateGuru app ; and spring for access to an airline or airport lounge.\nAnd here are some of my tips that will help make your trips with the kids better for everyone concerned.\nPrepare your children. It happens again and again on flights I’m on – children who have never flown and are confused and even scared. Take time to tell them what’s going to happen, and act things out, from going through security to boarding the plane. Keep your children occupied. Bring their favorite toys, games, iPad, coloring books or whatever it takes to keep them occupied during the flight. I’ve taken to bringing extra for other children on flights, and I always have takers. How would you feel if you were a child trapped in a metal tube for hours with nothing to do? Choose seats in advance – or buy one Early Bird Pass if you’re flying Southwest Airlines . You naturally want to sit with your child (I hope) on a flight. Always take the option to choose your seats in advance. Shell out that $12.50 each way on Southwest to ensure that you get seats together and don’t inconvenience your fellow passengers. Carry a food bag. Airline food has gone the way of the dinosaurs, and you never know when there's going to be a delay. So bring plenty of snacks, because kids get very cranky when they don’t eat. If you don't have time, use the GateGuru app to see what food options are available in the airport.
