But when electronic components are excluded, the country’s total exports actually grew 1.3 percent over the previous six months.\nRegarding losses in the agricultural sector, Mora said the drought in Guanacaste and flooding in Limón — both of which he attributed to a changing climate — caused losses of $250 million in pineapple, banana and other crops.\nExport sectors showing the most notable growth were medical devices, up 35 percent, coffee, up 21 percent, medicines, up 12 percent and diapers, up 5 percent.\nOn the other side, products that recorded a drop in sales in the past six months include bananas, pineapples, electric cables, textiles and milk.\nCosta Rica’s Central Bank ( BCCR ) confirmed last month that the decrease in export figures is being driven mainly by Intel’s exit.\n“The manufacturing industry recorded an annual fall of 3.0 percent due to the relocation of Intel’s operations to the Asian market,” reads BCCR’s analysis on Production, Employment and Wages from June. BCCR analysts believe that the “Intel effect” will decrease during the last quarter of 2015.\nTico products went to 141 different markets during the first six months of this year, but the main destinations were the United States, Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala and the Netherlands, COMEX noted.\nService Exports Also Grew\nThe COMEX report also states that exports of services in the 12 months between April 2014 and March 2015 reached a total of $6.4 billion, up 14.8 percent over the average figures recorded in the same three previous periods.\nTourism, computer and information, and business services comprise the majority of service exports. The sector has maintained a sustained growth trend over the last four years, according to COMEX records.", "external_links": ["http://indicadoreseconomicos.bccr.fi.cr/indicadoreseconomicos/Documentos/Informe%20Mensual/2015/Informe%20Mensual%20de%20Coyuntura%20Económica%20julio%202015.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-25T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T05:36:04.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
