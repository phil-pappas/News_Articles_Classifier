At the Inspiration Hub, the education sessions will be presented in a variety of formats, from Seminars, Campfires and Meet the Expert to Hot Topic Tables and a Research Pod. This will create a “learning hot spot” at the heart of the show with more than 100 sessions hosted by leading experts in their fields. Creativity techniques, always enjoyed by participants, will also be woven into education across the show. Smart Monday, Powered by MPI There are also multiple opportunities for buyers and exhibitors to add to their knowledge through co-located events, including the daily MPI keynotes and the Smart Monday, Powered by MPI, program on October 12th. Smart Monday for the second year will also include the PCMA Business School as well as Association Focus with sessions delivered by ASAE and ICCA. Rounding out the education programs, the Future Leaders Forum, Executive Meetings Forum and the Faculty Exchange sessions will also take place again this year at IMEX America. New Tracks for Young & Senior Professionals To make the most of this rich education program and allow buyers and exhibitors to zero in on or mix and match specific areas of interest, sessions at the show will be identified around 10 speciality tracks including: Business Skills, Marketing & Communications, Risk Management & Compliance, Technology & Social Media, Trends & Research, Creative Learning, Health & Wellbeing, Diversity, Sustainability and General Education. Two new session tracks will also be added with content specifically tailored towards Young Professionals - for anyone with up to 3 years’ experience - and Senior Professionals - for those with 8 years’ experience or more. To make it easier to count Continuing Education credits, pre-certified CMP/CEU points will be assigned to sessions where applicable and a downloadable CMP tracking sheet is available on the IMEX America website as well as at the show in the Inspiration Hub. Carina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group says: “Our education program evolves each year so that it continues to reflect changes in the industry and engages buyers and suppliers, whether they are looking to gain CMP/CEU Points, catching up on technology trends or exploring the latest sustainability solutions. There is something for everyone, whatever their preferred learning style or interest.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:41:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
