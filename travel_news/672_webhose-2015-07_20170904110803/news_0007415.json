American Airlines (Nasdaq: AAL) released a statement expressing the airline’s eagerness to establish routes between the U.S. and Cuba following today’s official reopening of the U.S. embassy in Havana. “The reopening of the United States and Cuban embassies in Havana and Washington is an important step toward building new commercial relationships and re-establishing scheduled air service between the U.S. and Cuba,” American Airlines CEO and chairman Doug Parker said in the statement. “American Airlines has operated charter flights to Cuba for nearly 25 years and we stand ready to begin scheduled service when it’s allowed.” The Fort Worth-based airline has offered routes to Cuba since 1991, with charter flights out of Miami and Tampa to Camaguey, Cienfuegos , Havana, Holguin and Santa Clara. The reopening of embassies on both U.S. and Cuban soil is a result of efforts to restore diplomatic relations between the two nations. \nWant Dallas Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:43:01.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
