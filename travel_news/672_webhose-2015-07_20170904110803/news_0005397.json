Above them are the words: “William Meade Lindsley Fiske III An American citizen who died that England might live.” It’s an unobtrusive little memorial. The words provide only a little hint of the extraordinary life that inspired them. • A tribute to Billy Fiske Billy Fiske - no one, not even his mother, called him William - was a golden member of the greatest generation. A man who won his first Olympic gold medal when he was 16 and his second when he was 20, who set enduring records on the famous Cresta Run, and who, ultimately, became one of the very first American airmen to die in the Second World War. While fighting for our country. Billy Fiske on the 1928 Olympics bobsled team in St Moritz (Corbis) In the years since the plaque was unveiled, on Independence Day, 1941, there have been several attempts to tell the story of Billy’s life. Two movies have been planned, the most recent of them set to star Tom Cruise, but neither was produced. There are various reasons why. Not least that one crucial piece of information was always missing. What, exactly, persuaded Billy to give his life for England? No one knew. Until now. With the help of Billy’s family, who gave me access to his previously unpublished letters and diaries, I was able to find the answer while researching my new book, Speed Kings . • Flashback: the Pilgrims that set sail for America Billy Fiske was born in Chicago in 1911. His family were blue-bloods. They could trace their American roots right back to the Mayflower. Billy’s father was a banker with Dillon, Read & Co. In 1924, the firm moved him to Paris to oversee their new investments in Weimar Germany. Billy was sent to a boarding school in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire. He wasn’t there long. But those years shaped him. He came to feel that “altogether my roots are almost stronger here than any place I know.” Holidaymakers in St Moritz resort, Switzerland in 1932 (Hulton Archive) Each Christmas, the Fiskes would head to the winter playground of St Moritz. Billy took to the bobsledding slopes. At the end of his first season, the logbook of the St Moritz Toboggan Club noted that he was “a natural sledder”. Everyone who knew Billy used that word, “natural”. He was blessed with an uncanny ability to handle speeding machines, whether they were sleds, cars, or planes. In 1928, Billy’s wins earned him a place on US team for the second ever Winter Olympics. He raced with a scratch crew. • The joy of the Winter Olympics One, Geoff Mason, remembered Billy as “an extremely mature young man, very sophisticated, and very smart, but not a smart alec. And of course he was a crackerjack bobsled driver. Unquestionably the best anywhere.” Billy’s team won the gold by a margin of half a second. For 64 years, he remained the youngest man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. After that, Billy moved to Cambridge, where he studied History & Economics at Trinity. He spent most of his time tearing around the country lanes in his supercharged Bentley ’Blower’. “He was a tough, wiry, fearless fellow,” recalled his friend Henry Longhurst. “And the most wonderful driver of a vehicle.” Trinity College Cambridge, where Billy Fiske studied (Alamy) Billy set a number of records in that car, the kind that aren’t set down in books but kept between friends. Like making fastest road run from Cambridge to London was one, or from Cannes to Monte Carlo. When Billy returned to the US to compete in the 1932 Winter Olympics, he found he wasn’t welcome. The locals in Lake Placid, upstate New York, had their own team and they didn’t warm to this “expatriate playboy”. They even had a collection to raise money to bet against him. Which was a mistake, since Billy loved to gamble. The competition was one of the most dangerous, and spectacular, in Olympic history. Ten men were put in hospital, and two more almost lost their lives. Billy won by two seconds. • The story of the 1936 Olympic Games Billy skipped the 1936 Olympics in Germany. After his death, a friend said that this was because “he couldn’t stand Nazis”. But Billy was disillusioned, too, with the officials running the US team. He decided instead to start a ski resort in Aspen, then a desolate mining town, ruined by the Great Depression. He also set up his own film company, the idea being that they would make “authentic” movies in exotic locations. He squandered most of his savings making a dismal picture called ’Cane Fire’ in Hawaii. The star, Virginia Cherrill, was engaged to Cary Grant, who was so paranoid that she and Billy were having an affair that he bribed the switchboard operators at their hotel to listen in to their telephone conversations. The 1936 Olympic Games with the torch running through Berlin (Getty) Grant was right to worry. Billy was a womaniser. He had an affair with the film star Alice Faye, and another with the Polish Princess Paulette Poniatowski. It was his great friend David Niven who introduced him to Rose Bingham, Countess of Warwick. She had moved to Hollywood with her husband, the Earl of Warwick, when he tried to launch a career as a movie star with MGM. They divorced soon after, and Rose and Billy were married on August 24, 1938, after a romance on the slopes in St Moritz. • Sochi Winter Olympics: one year on Billy fell in with her English friends, many of them members of RAF 601 squadron, the ’Millionaires’ Mob’. He said that when war broke out, he was going to fight alongside them. “It had become an ongoing joke between the lot of us,” said his friend Bill Clyde. “None of us took him seriously.” They were wrong. In August 1939, Billy arrived in England to volunteer. His friends from the Cresta Run organized an interview for him with the Chief of Air Staff the following Sunday. “Needless to say,” Billy wrote in his diary, “for once I had a quiet night - I didn’t want to have eyes looking like bloodshot oysters the next day.” The RAF weren’t accepting citizens from outside the Commonwealth at that time, so Billy pretended to be Canadian. When the authorities later twigged that he was really from the US, they tried to persuade him to go back there on a propaganda tour. A Hurricane - the type of plane that Billy Fiske would have flown (Getty) “I’ve done nothing yet,” Billy told them. “Wait till I’ve down some Heinkels. Then, if you still want me, I’ll go over.” It was in a letter to his sister Peggy, written around this time, that he finally explained his thinking. The English, Billy wrote, had “been damn good to me in good times so naturally I feel I ought to try and help out in bad if I can. There are absolutely no heroics in my motives, I’m probably twice as scared as the next man, but if anything happens to me I at least can feel I have done the right thing in spite of the worry to my family - which I certainly couldn’t feel if I was to sit in New York making dough.” • The canine heroes of the Second World War In July 1940, Billy was posted to RAF Tangmere, where he joined his friends in 601. Rose took a house nearby. On August 16, he was shot down. In one final piece of stupendous skill, he managed to nurse his burning Hurricane back to the airfield, and bring it down through a steep dive into a belly landing. He died of his wounds the next day.
