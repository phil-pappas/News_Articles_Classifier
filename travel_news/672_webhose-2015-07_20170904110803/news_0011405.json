Did you mean ? \nFor many visitors, the dream idea of a UK country hotel is a charming house where a roaring fire crackles in the hearth, tea is served to guests flushed from country walks and dinners are gourmet feasts. \nSounds lovely doesn't it. \nBut if the country house is a damp and drafty pile, a million miles from anything interesting with stuffy guests, bad cooking and no activities to pass the time, the best country house ideas can turn sour. \nDon't worry - we've tried these recommended UK country house hotels so you'll know what to expect, what we like about them and what they might do better. Check out these UK hotel ideas. We stayed here, in the Shepherd's Room of the Devonshire Arms. Look carefully and you'll spot all the \"sheepish\" decor. Courtesy of the Devonshire Arms • The Devonshire Arms Country House Hotel – in the Yorkshire Dales \nThe original inn at The Devonshire Arms has been welcoming guests for more than 300 years. Rooms here are high and spacious in the period style. Furnishings are either traditional or, in the newer Wharfedale wing, more contemporary. \nWith a staff to guest ratio of 3 to 1, people are on hand to make things happen for you. You want a picnic at a particular spot, a tennis partner, a chauffeured tour of the National Park? They’ll make it all happen. If you want to walk a dog and have left yours at home, this lavishly dog-friendly hotel will even lend you one of their two Cocker Spaniels to walk.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:52:07.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
