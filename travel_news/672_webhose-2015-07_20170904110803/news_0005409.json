The belt-tightening measures, which include pension cuts and higher sales tax rates on everything from condoms to race horses, were agreed upon with eurozone leaders to prevent the Greek economy from collapsing, and as part of a planned third bailout worth 85 billion euros ($93 billion). The new measures mean economically-battered Greeks will have to pay more for most goods and services by the end of the week. Hard-liners in Prime Minister Tsipras' own Syriza party were in open revolt, and unions and trade associations representing civil servants, municipal workers, pharmacy owners and others called or extended strikes to coincide with Wednesday's Parliament vote. Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis said lead eurozone lender Germany and its allies had acted like \"financial assassins\" by forcing the deal on Athens, and urged Tsipras to reject it. \"The deal is unacceptable,\" Lafazanis said in a statement. \"It may pass through Parliament ... but the people will never accept it and will be united in their fight against it.\"In an interview on state TV, Tsipras said he would not step down, despite the open dissent within his own Cabinet and party. \"I will not run away from my responsibilities,\" he said. He also criticized the deal, but said it was the best Greece could get. \"The policies imposed on us were irrational,\" Tsipras said. \"We faced a tough and punitive position from our partners ... But the (agreement) does offer a way out of the crisis.\"Pro-European opposition parties have pledged support for the bailout bills, but Tsipras could effectively lose his majority in Parliament, weakening his ability to push through measures that he had himself vehemently opposed until a few weeks ago. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T02:52:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
