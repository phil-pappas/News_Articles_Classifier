Many larger hotels have been forced to make personnel cuts. \nTurkey's average hotel occupancy rate fell 7.6 percent last month year-on-year, the largest drop in occupancy among the surveyed countries in Europe, according to an announcement the Turkey Hoteliers' Association (TUROB) released last week. While the overall occupancy rate for hotels in Turkey stood at 68.6 percent in June of 2014, that number dipped to 63.3 percent last month, the TUROB said in its announcement, citing figures from the STR Global analysis firm. \nAverage room prices have also dropped alongside falling occupancy rates. The average room price stood at 149.1 euros in June of 2014, decreasing to 134.5 euros last month. Many upscale hotels have been forced to cut prices in an effort to attract visitors during a particularly rough period for the Turkish tourism sector. \nTÜROFED said earlier this month it forecasts an economic cost of $5 billion due to the falling number of visitors to Turkey. The federation said tourists to Turkey had also spent fewer days in the country on average so far this year as compared to 2014. \nThe perception that the wars in Iraq and Syria are spilling over into Turkey has only been heightened by Turkish airstrikes against terrorist groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as well as fire exchanged over the Syrian border between the latter and the Turkish military.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:13:58.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
