Ada Colau, the city’s new leftist mayor, took office last month promising social changes, including a plan to deal with the problem of mass tourism in the city. Barcelona is one of Europe's top destinations but many residents complain the city is being overrun and losing its character. The town hall said it plans to study existing accommodation capacity and its economic and social impact, and start a public debate on developing a sustainable tourism plan by early 2016. Ms Colau had recently told newspaper El Pais that she didn’t want the city to end up “like Venice” and that she wanted to act before “things get out of hand”. Barcelona has become one of Europe’s most popular cities for holidaymakers. Since it hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics – an event which, slickly presented, radically shifted the perception of the city from the idea of a crime-ridden relic to a bright enclave of beaches, bars and bravado architecture – Barcelona has been an enormous success story. While its infamously efficient pickpockets remain an issue, there is no indication that familiarity with the city has become contempt. In 2013, it welcomed 7.5 million tourists – six million from beyond Spain’s borders. In 2000, the relevant statistic was 3.14 million tourists – a doubling of numbers in the space of just 13 years. Telegraph Travel’s Barcelona expert Sally Davies, a resident of the city, said that the sub-letting of flats to tourists is pricing many locals out of the property market. Other recent moves to control tourist numbers in the city have included introducing an €8 fee for entry into Parc Guell in 2013 and, in April this year, barring larger tour parties from La Boqueria, the iconic market hall on La Rambla.
