Comment   Writer Posted Jul. 20, 2015 at 10:56 AM Posted Jul. 20, 2015 at 10:56 AM KIM, Colo. â€“ Work on the Colorado Department of Transportation project to improve a section of U.S. Highway 160 near Kim, Colorado, has started. This safety improvement project was contracted to APC Southern Construction for $4.8 million and is funded in part with Colorado FASTER funds. The project boundaries are between milepost 405 and milepost 423, east and west of Kim. Work is scheduled for completion the by the end of October 2015. The project consists of a bridge replacement project, a 1 1/2\" asphalt overlay with additional full depth patching in select locations, new guardrail, and delineators, striping, traffic and environmental controls. TRAFFIC IMPACTS - Work hours are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. There is no holiday or weekend work anticipated at this time. Be advised that there will be a detour for local traffic during the bridge replacement phase of the project. Work on the replacement of bridge over Smith Canyon, west of Kim, will begin Aug. 1, and will be completed in mid-August. During this phase of the project, U.S. 160 will be closed and traffic will be rerouted around the closure. Truck and through traffic will be detoured at the intersection of Highways 160 and 350, where they will continue on Highway 350 out of La Junta, Colorado. Motorists should allow for an additional 60 minutes of travel time. Travelers on Highway 109 will be able to come into Kim, but will not be able to travel onto Highway 160. They will need to return on Highway 109 or detour on highway 350 at La Junta. Traffic on 389 will be routed on to the Highway 160 and 350 intersection. Only local traffic will be able to use the county road detour. The speed limit through the paving portion of the project is reduced to 40 mph during work hours with flagger controlled stops, so motorists should allow for travel delays up to 15 minutes. Traffic will be reduced to a single-lane through the work zone. All business and residence access will be maintained, but may be temporarily altered. Thank you for going slow for the cone zone!
