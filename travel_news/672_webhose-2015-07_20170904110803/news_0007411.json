The first of its kind ever to be put into operation in the Dominican Republic, the new One Link Global eco-friendly cleaning and sanitizing system will aid waste reduction, help simplify processes and contribute to reducing the hotel's entire carbon footprint. Easier to maintain and service, the new management system is also expected to improve employees' overall working conditions. \nThe upgraded cleaning and sanitizing program is just one of the steps the hotel chain has made with regards to improving sustainability throughout all operations. Earlier this year, two of its other properties Royalton Punta Cana , Dominican Republic and Royalton White Sands , Jamaica were highly commended by Green Globe , the only international organization rating hotels based on their long-term commitment to incorporating sustainable practices into their day-to-day operations. \nGeneral Manager for CHIC Punta Cana , Mauricio Zarate, commented, \"We are proud to be able to have made this significant investment towards improving our eco-footprint so soon since opening last Christmas and to be leading the way across the island with this new technology. As well as streamlining our operations, the new ECA and Green Chemical program is a significant step towards achieving our overall green sustainability target, including Green Globe accreditation in the medium term. Tourism is an extremely important industry to the Dominican Republic and it is important that resorts such as ours do all they can to ensure the environment is impacted as little as possible by their activities.\" \nGennaro Cirone, President of One Link Global (OLG) added, \"This represents a new milestone for OLG and full commitment from the Blue Diamond Resort Group to practice and implement Green Sustainable business practices on their properties. This is the first ever combined ECA and Green Chemical Program in the Dominican Republic. It is truly an innovative Sustainable Program .
