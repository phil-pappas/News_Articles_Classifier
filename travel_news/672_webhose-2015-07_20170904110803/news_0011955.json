Ad Feedback \n\"The social media campaign has been sensational. We will be keeping a close eye on that and it will be taken into our considerations,\" he said. \nNational list MP Jono Naylor set up the popular Jetstar to Palmerston North Facebook page, which has over 11,000 likes. \nNaylor has also championed an online survey. \n\"The Jetstar to Palmerston North survey had over 1000 responses, which shows strong local support for including Palmerston North in Jetstar's regional expansion,\" he said. \nRival Facebook page Bring Jetstar to Taranaki has over 12,000 likes. \nKerr said Jetstar had a tight time frame and a decision was expected in early September. \nPalmerston North Mayor Grant Smith described the meeting as positive and said he rated the city's chances. \n\"This is the biggest turnout they've had,\" he said. \n\"I think we tick a lot of the boxes. \n\"Our infrastructure is already set up so we're ready to go.\" \nManawatu Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stephanie Gundersen-Reid also said the meeting had been a success. \nThe airline will choose four centres to fly from from a shortlist of seven, including Palmerston North. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:39:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
