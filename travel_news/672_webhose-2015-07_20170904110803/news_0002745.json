Bands, Brews and BBQs will be held every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from July 31 through Aug. 16. Like the Taste of the Carolinas festival earlier in the season , the new event will feature booths throughout the park offering servings of smoked beef, pork and poultry. A dedicated booth featuring regional sauces will boast 24 flavors. And local bands will play at the patio at Harmony Hall throughout the day during the festival's run. “We are excited to continue the enhancements we have made this year to our culinary programs with the introduction of another signature food event,” said Kris Suita , Carowinds’ executive chef. “It truly makes it a ‘best day ever’ park experience for our guests. And after the positive response we received from our Taste of the Carolinas event this past spring, we felt it was the perfect opportunity to end the summer with something that defines the Carolina experience — mouthwatering BBQ.” The revamped food program is one aspect of an ongoing, $50 million makeover of the Charlotte region’s top tourist attraction. Several rides have been added, including the acclaimed Fury 325, billed as the “world’s tallest and fastest giga coaster.” Since its opening in March, more than a million riders have braved the coaster, which has raised the park’s profile among thrill-seekers as well as national media outlets . The next phase of improvements is likely to be announced in the coming months. Carowinds will retire its classic wooden coaster, Thunder Road, after this weekend to make way for new additions, and the park has hinted at a “big splash” coming later in the summer. Carowinds is owned and operated by Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. (NYSE:FUN), based in Ohio. The 400-acre park, which straddles the North Carolina-South Carolina state line, drew 1.9 million visitors in 2014 — and with the latest upgrades, officials are looking to push that number to 2.5 million . \nWant Charlotte Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:54:38.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
