Created in 2008, Hootsuite is the most widely used platform for managing social media and offers a complete set of offerings for every user's need, whether you’re an individual, small business or large organisation. Following a recent expansion, Hootsuite sent its 135 strong EMEA sales team to HMS Belfast for a corporate assembly like no other. \nLorien Henson, Senior Events Marketing Manager at Hootsuite explains: “Our events marketing team in conjunction with our contract event management firm MeetGreen organised the Annual company kick-off event for our EMEA based teams. We were looking for a unique meeting venue that coincided with our meeting's theme of ‘Oceans of Opportunity’. HMS Belfast is also centrally located with a high WOW factor; perfect for our out-of-town guests.” The one-day event was comprised of a full-company meeting in one main space with video, audio and guest speakers, in addition to smaller breakout meetings throughout the afternoon. All four event spaces on the ship were utilised, from the Ship’s Company Dining Hall to the Admiral’s Quarters, creating a mix of meeting spaces and catering areas. With guests arriving at 8:00am Sodexo Prestige chefs welcomed the group aboard with a breakfast of freshly baked mini Danish pastries and muffins, and a mid-morning snack which included fruit platters and granola. A hot-fork buffet followed at lunchtime consisting of slow cooked beef bolognaise with penne pasta and parmesan shavings; traditional fish pie with smoked haddock and pollock fillet, leeks and garden peas topped with mashed potato and cheddar; Thai sweet potato red curry with steamed rice, and apple crumble with vanilla custard. An afternoon snack of crudités, chips and hummus, and fresh fruit platters kept the Hootsuite owls going for the rest of the day. Henson concludes: “The event planning was somewhat stressful. We had a number of technical aspects and logistics that needed to be taken care of, plus 130+ team members. It was certainly challenging. However during the event the HMS Belfast staff were very helpful and friendly which helped ensure our event ran smoothly. We had catering throughout the day, which was served on time and efficiently to accommodate our tight schedule. I would certainly recommend the venue for its location and for being a unique venue.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T12:46:45.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
