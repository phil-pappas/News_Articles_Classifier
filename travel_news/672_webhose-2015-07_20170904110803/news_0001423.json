(AP) -- A Virginia park that is a star-gazer's haven has been named an International Dark Sky Park. The designation for Staunton River State Park in Scottsburg recognizes the park's outdoor lighting policy, which is intended to minimize so-called light pollution. It makes the park a welcome dark place in the densely populated East Coast. The recognition is from the International Dark Sky Places Association, which advocates for the protection of night skies. Staunton River State Park promotes a star party each year. More than 140 visitors attended last year's event at the Southside park. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation says Staunton River State Park is the first state park in Virginia to be recognized by the association. --- Online\" International Dark Sky Places: http://www.darksky.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T04:46:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
