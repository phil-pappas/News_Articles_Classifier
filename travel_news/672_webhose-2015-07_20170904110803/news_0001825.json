The idea occurred in 2002 when he was working as a science adviser on Capitol Hill, during a period of heightened security following the 9/11 bombings. He recalled that as he waited to go through security, “I’d watch these other Capitol Hill staffers, and I noticed that they just put their hand over their keys in their pockets so they didn’t have to waste 30 seconds putting it on the conveyer belt. And that didn’t set off the alarm when they did that. And it just made me think adaptable organisms, if you’re talking about an adaptable terrorist, are going to figure out a way to get around this.” In a later book, Learning From the Octopus: How Secrets From Nature Can Help Us Fight Terrorist Attacks, Natural Disasters, and Disease (2012), Sagarin argued that the security issues faced by human societies are analogous to those faced by many organisms in the natural world, where risks are frequent, variable and uncertain. Yet, while animals respond to such threats by reducing uncertainty for themselves and increasing it for their adversaries, human security authorities tend to do the opposite, reducing the uncertainty of society’s enemies by telling them exactly what they are searching for (for instance, making air travellers take off their shoes after a criminal tries to blow up a plane with a shoe bomb). Sagarin at work on the shore Public uncertainty is also increased, he believed, by providing nearly meaningless colour-coded warnings. “Does anyone, for example, know what we should do differently if the Department of Homeland Security raises the threat level from orange to red?” he asked. To Sagarin, to fight a “war on terror”–based on a broad, top-down reactionary strategy – is futile: “Terrorists figure out unexpected means of attack, hackers come up with new software to break through firewalls, and pathogens develop resistance to antibiotics.” Instead, policy makers should emulate the sort of bottom-up Darwinian strategies adopted in the natural world in the face of outside threats. The giant octopus, for example, has pigment cells distributed all over its body which react to and match the colours of its surroundings, without any centralised input from the brain. Birds flock to increase the uncertainty for predators looking for weaklings. Bees swarm and attack when they perceive a threat to the hive. Nearly all organisms depend on at least one or two – and in some cases many – other species for their survival (a phenomenon known as symbiosis). The only clear successes in western security systems, Sagarin maintained, come about when individuals close to the action show the sort of adaptability encountered in the natural world. Like bees protecting their hive, passengers on United Flight 93 gave their lives to bring their hijacking to a premature end in a Pennsylvania field. Likewise, when American soldiers were being killed in Iraq by improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, it was only when men on the ground, like the pigment cells of an octopus, were authorised to make their own decisions (a development that is known as the Petraeus Doctrine) that ways were found of combating the threat, including negotiating “symbiotic” partnerships often with people who were previously shooting at them, to infiltrate the networks of bomb makers. Sagarin, on left, with Bill Clinton and Al Gore looking at tidal pools on the Pacific coastline (AFP) Sagarin felt that the Department of Homeland Security also had much to learn from the way in which ground squirrels use alarm signals when a predator is nearby, not only to warn their peers, but more importantly to make it known to the attacker that its cover is blown – signals which, remarkably, are not only specific to the threat but are communicated in the predator’s own language. The squirrels make shrill calls to hawks and coyotes, while if the predator is a snake they wave their tails from side to side. If the snake is a rattlesnake, the squirrel also heats its tail up, because rattlesnakes see in infrared. Organisms and humans should plan for things that occur with some frequency, he argued, but the biggest dangers human societies face are those which have not yet been identified. “Leaders of the agencies responsible for security need to lose their bunker mentality, venture out into nature and stare into the eye of an octopus.” Raphael David Sagarin was born on June 20 1971 in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1994 he took a degree in earth systems biology at Stanford University and, while there, he and three colleagues compared the abundance of the shore species off the rocks at Pacific Grove, California with those identified in the same area by a researcher in the 1930s, providing some of the first evidence, published in the journal Science, that southern species were moving north because of ocean warming. Sagarin went on to take a doctorate in ecology, evolution and marine biology from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2001. Before joining the University of Arizona in 2009, he served for three years as associate director of Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions. Sagarin, who died after being knocked from his bicycle by a lorry, is survived by his wife Rebecca and by their two daughters.
