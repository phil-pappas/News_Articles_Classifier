A fire engine arrived within 10 minutes of the emergency call just after midnight Friday, according to park officials.\nFirefighters carried out one person from the second floor who was unresponsive. Resuscitation efforts continued for almost an hour before he was declared dead at the scene.\nThe victim's identity was being withheld until his family could be told.\nFour others were treated for minor injuries and smoke inhalation and taken to a hospital in Jackson for further care, park officials said.\nAbout 70 people were evacuated from the dormitory building and took shelter elsewhere for the rest of the night.\nFirefighters contained the fire to a single room. Neighboring rooms had smoke damage.\nThe flames were snuffed out by 2 p.m. The cause isn't yet known but will be investigated, park officials said.\nIn nearby Yellowstone National Park, search and rescue teams have been looking for Feiyang \"Isaac\" Xiang, 21, a seasonal park concession worker from China who went missing in the Yellowstone River on July 23. Xiang was swimming with friends when the current pulled him away from shore.\nOn June 23, a bison tossed a 19-year-old off-duty park concession employee in Yellowstone. The unidentified woman was treated and released from a hospital for minor injuries.\nThe popular national parks are at the height of summer tourist season. Jobs at the parks' privately operated restaurants and hotels draw hundreds of seasonal workers to the region every year.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T22:51:30.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
