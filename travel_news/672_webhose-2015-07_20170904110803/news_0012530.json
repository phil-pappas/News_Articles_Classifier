The project, which organizers say is the park's most extensive restoration effort since the 1890s, includes work during this year and 2016. Beginning July 13, the park at 2701 L St. in Sacramento will close to the public for one month \"to maximize guest safety and project efficiency,\" according to organizers. Expect to see restoration of exterior walls, seismic stabilization of the park's central building and upgrades to pathways in and around Sutter's Fort, among other things. Led by California State Parks , the effort is funded by public funds and private donations. The current projects cost about $1 million, according to organizers. New outdoor event lighting is expected to be installed in 2016. Thanks to a partnership with the Sacramento Convention & Visitors Bureau , the park's website will feature aerial photography and drone videos of progress on the restoration effort. \nWant Sacramento Travel news in your inbox?
