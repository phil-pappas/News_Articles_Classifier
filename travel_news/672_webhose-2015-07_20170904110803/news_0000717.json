Sky News 10 Jul 2015 News Not looking good ... a departure board of flights is seen at Bali's international airport, Indonesia. Picture: AP Source: AP \nJETSTAR and Virgin Australia are taking a cautious approach to the resumption of flights out of Bali following the reopening of Ngurah Rai Airport in Denpasar at midday despite thousands of passengers being stranded. \nA statement from Virgin Australia downplayed early plans to resume flying despite admitting that the latest advice from their meteorologists and Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre indicated conditions had improved. \n“However to ensure the safety of operating in the area, Virgin Australia requires pilots to have visual confirmation of the improved conditions first,” the company said in a statement on Saturday afternoon. \n“Therefore Virgin Australia has sent an observation flight to Denpasar this afternoon.” Denpasar Airport on #Bali has reopened after closure due to #MtRaung ash cloud. http://t.co/IFbPbA83On pic.twitter.com/1Kwyytrpa0 — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) July 11, 2015 \nVirgin Australia stated a decision would be made at 8pm and passengers booked on Virgin Australia flights out of Bali on Saturday night are advised to wait for that announcement before making their way to the airport.. \nJetstar also went against its previous statement that flights would resume earlier today. It now states that it has delayed all of its evening flights to and from Bali by between two and four hours. \nA spokesman for Jetstar said the latest information from VAAC tindicated flying conditions had improved as the ash cloud has moved southwest of Bali on Saturday morning. \nBut the company said it had delayed departure of scheduled flights between Australia and Bali. \n“We’ve done this to enable our operations team to assess the next Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) update before making a decision on tonight’s flying,” Jetstar said. \nJetstar said that flights: Q35 from Melbourne to Bali scheduled to depart at 17:15 is delayed to 21:30; JQ 37 from Sydney to Bali 17:20 departure delayed to 21:00; JQ 127 from Adelaide to Bali, 19:05 departure delayed to 21:00; JQ 36 from Bali to Melbourne, 22:30 departure delayed to 02:40; JQ 38 from Bali to Sydney, 23:05 departure delayed to 03:15; JQ 128 from Bali to Adelaide, 23:50 departure delayed to 01:50. \nPassengers will be advised well before departure times whether the services are going ahead. Chaos ... passengers queue up at the international terminal at Bali's Ngurah Rai airport in Denpasar. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nA Jetstar spokesman said additional services were being considered for tomorrow “subject to clear flying conditions”. \nThe ash plume from Mount Raung has played havoc with flight schedules since mid week and led to the closure of Ngurah Rai International Airport. \nVolcanic ash is known to cause serious damage to aircraft and can lead to engine “flame outs”. \nThousands of Australians are believed to be stranded in Bali as a result of flight cancellations. \nThousands more have been unable to travel to the Indonesian holiday Island from Australia. \nJuly is typically one of the biggest months for Aussie tourists visiting Bali, with about 99,000 departures last year. \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has over 4000 Australians currently registered in Bali, but a spokeswoman said the real number was thought to be significantly higher. \nSenior meteorologist at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin, Stephanie Bond, said the plume had moved to the south of the volcano which meant Denpasar had been cleared of ash. \n“Most of Bali is clear, there’s just a little bit in the far western parts,” said Ms Bond. \n“We’re expecting conditions to remain the same for the next three days with winds coming from the north. \n“Beyond that, it’s difficult to say, as volcanoes are unpredictable and Mount Raung is continuing to erupt.” \nDenpasar airport was closed on Friday because of the plumes rising from Mt Raung, along with nearby regional terminals including Lombok, which has also reopened. The ash grounded planes from Virgin, Jetstar, Garuda and AirAsia. \nBoth Jetstar and Virgin say there will be additional flights between Australia and Bali as soon as conditions improve, and all airlines affected are keeping up to date with the latest information provided by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC). Long wait ... passengers line up after their flights were cancelled at Bali's international airport. Picture: AP Source: AP \nJetstar Australia and New Zealand CEO David Hall said the situation which has left thousands of Australians stranded was “extremely regrettable”. \n“We share our customers’ frustrations with the situation to Bali,” said Mr Hall. \n“It’s extremely regrettable that our customers’ holidays have been spoiled by these disruptions and that we can’t provide the certainty we would like to due to the unpredictability of the volcanic ash cloud surrounding this airport.” \nHe indicated Qantas may join Jetstar in providing additional services to clear the backlog of passengers once the ash cloud cleared. \n“We have teams working around the clock, monitoring conditions in Bali and assisting customers as best we can in these trying circumstances,” Mr Hall said. Causing trouble ... Mount Raung in Banyuwangi, East Java, Indonesia, spews ash. Picture: AP Source: AP \nAuthorities raised the alert status of Mount Raung, a 3300-metre volcano, late last month to the second highest level after it began to spew lava and ash high into the air forcing the planes to stop flying. \nPassengers impacted by the flight cancellations have been left to fend for themselves in Bali, with many sleeping on the airport floor. \nAirlines don’t provide accommodation or meal vouchers during such events because they are deemed beyond their control. \nFees for rebootings, cancellations and flight changes are being waived for limited periods by Jetstar, Virgin Australia, AirAsia and Garuda. The smoke and ash from Indonesian volcano Mount Raung ... It began erupting last week causing chaos and cancellation of flights to and from Bali. Picture: Instagram photo by @tanandsmiley (Tanya Sandow) Source: Instagram \nSenior meteorologist at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, Stephanie Bond, said the last time Mount Raung erupted, it continued to erupt for many weeks. \n“The volcano is continually emitting ash and the winds are staying in the same direction,” said Ms Bond. \n“For the foreseeable future there won’t be any reprieve. Winds generally move due to weather systems, and there’s no strong driver of winds in the area.” \nBali is a favourite holiday destination for Australians. Crowds of foreign tourists were stranded at Bali’s Ngurah Rai airport, waiting for further information about their flights. \nAir New Zealand said a flight due to depart from Bali on Saturday afternoon had been rescheduled to leave early on Sunday, conditions permitting.

Virgin is advising customers to call 13 67 89 to rearrange their bookings. \nMelbourne resident Brendan McCarthy was told his flight home from Bali on Friday had been cancelled until at least Monday. \nOther travellers were being told their flights could be delayed until July 23, he said. \n“We’ve been here for two weeks, have changed accommodation three times now,” Mr McCarthy told AAP. \nAs well as missing work, medical appointments and sporting commitments, he and his girlfriend are also facing additional unplanned travel costs that they hope to recoup through travel insurance. \n“A fantastic holiday is now having a really bad ending,” Mr McCarthy said. \nA Perth couple said they had been left without cash after their flight home was grounded. \nRoss and Leigh-Ann McNulty said they spent $3000 to fly their family of four home with AirAsia on Friday after their Jetstar flights were cancelled. But they faced at least another day in Bali after Denpasar airport was closed.

Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nThey told AAP that they were desperate to get home as Mrs McNulty has run out of medication and Mr McNulty needs to work. They weren’t able to claim the costs under their travel insurance and were borrowing money from friends. \n“My husband’s self-employed, we might have to end up declaring bankruptcy now because things have got that bad,” Mrs McNulty said. \n“This has just financially ruined us really.” \nMr McNulty said they pleaded with Jetstar to prioritise them for medical reasons, but nothing worked. \n“It’s turning out to be the Bali holiday from hell basically,” he said. \n“We love the Balinese people, but we’ll probably never come back as a result of the debacle of the airlines. \n“I realise they’ve got to put the safety of passengers first, but the actual way they’ve been so quiet and not let us know is just devastating. \n“It’s not good enough, we paid good money to board these flights and the least they could do is look after us when they make so much money.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T07:12:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
