Allegiant Airlines announced on Monday that it will continue its seasonal service from CVG to Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport until Nov. 29. That’s the second extension of the route since it launched in May. Allegiant will also double its weekly flights to Las Vegas from two to four starting in November. The expansions follow Frontier Airlines' plan to add daily direct service to Fort Meyers, Fla., and increased service to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Las Vegas that it announced earlier this year. In June, Allegiant and Frontier generated 18.4 percent of airport traffic, which was the highest percentage of low-cost flights in CVG history. CVG vice president for external affairs Bobby Spann said the growth of low-cost carriers has been beneficial and they’re continuing to expand in way that is boosting the airport. Overall, a total of 300,994 passengers flew from CVG last month, which represents an 8 percent increase from June 2014 and the best month the airport has had since August 2011. Of those passengers, roughly 85 percent were boarding or deplaning at CVG rather than catching connection flights. \nWant Cincinnati Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
