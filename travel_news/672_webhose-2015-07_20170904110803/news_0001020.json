Boasting a fully redesigned front section, it also benefits from a better layout, making it more user-friendly than ever before. HEY Conferences' firm belief is that when a conference's host city is relevant to its content it can result in increased engagement between the event and the destination, adding value for both the conference organiser and the region. In line with this, HEY Conferences' strategy is to target conferences and events whose content reflects the region's industry strengths - and the new guide reflects this by containing a brief overview of Hull & East Yorkshire's main industries. With Hull's year as 2017 UK City of Culture drawing ever closer, the guide has also encourages organisers who may be considering holding a cultural conference to contact HEY Conferences. Following feedback from HEY Conferences' venue partners, a new feature of the guide highlights how close the venues and hotels in the city centre are to one another, promoting a multi-venue approach for larger events. Conference organisers are often surprised how compact the city centre actually is; and the new guide is able to feature suggested venue combinations. Encouraging conference and event organisers to 'Explore, Experience, Enjoy' the new guide features a run-down of social activities: from visiting up and coming cultural quarters, nature reserves and microbreweries; to attending top events such as Freedom Festival and the annual Walking and Outdoors Festival. As well as testimonials from organisers who have held their event in Hull & East Yorkshire, the guide includes video interviews from local event organisers who act as ambassadors for the region.
