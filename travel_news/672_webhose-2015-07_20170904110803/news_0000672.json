This office model, which experts say has been evolving in the real estate world, offers an opportunity for businesses of all sizes.\n\"This works very well for entrepreneurs and small businesses who don't want to spend the money\" on long-term leases, said Ronald Shapiro, executive director of the Rutgers Business School's Center for Real Estate. He added that sometimes larger businesses take advantage of these spaces as they try to downsize, too.\nThe trend is emerging as the office market in North Jersey has suffered in recent years. With more office spaces becoming harder to fill as companies downsize, real estate companies have invested in restructuring traditional office buildings to multiuse properties, hoping to lure clients. This trend is a cost-effective opportunity for the tenant and allows the owner \"to convert existing vacant office space to leasable space,\" said Shapiro.\nBusinesses have been turning to shareable office spaces for the past five or 10 years, said Shapiro.\nRegus, a global workspace provider, is a major player in the office-sharing market in North Jersey, offering space in East Rutherford, Totowa, Hackensack, Paramus, Fort Lee, Mahwah, Saddle Brook and Woodcliff Lake. However, the majority of big players in office sharing, including Regus, focus most of their investments in places like New York City, Jersey City and Hoboken.\nThese spaces come at varying costs. A business can rent a meeting room at any Regus location for $19.25 an hour, or it could rent a day office for $17.25 an hour. For $219 a month, a business can rent a virtual office, which comes with a mailing address, access to professional teams that handle calls and a private office. The services also include access to Wi-Fi, video communication suites and other technology perks.\nBergen Community College's campus in Lyndhurst offers almost identical services. However, for a business to gain access to the school's shareable space, which spans the third floor of its 1280 Wall Street West building, a company needs to complete an application process and qualify as a start-up.\nAt the Meadowlands campus, the school has an incubator program called FUSE that offers start-ups access to collaborative workspace, Internet and Wi-Fi access, event space, conference rooms on the building's fifth floor, a mailing address and office equipment like printers and fax machines. Memberships, which start at $99 a month, also include access to business experts from the New Jersey Small Business Development Center and the state's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n\"With the downturn of the economy, there were a lot of folks really looking at that space,\" said Christine Gillespie, dean of the Division of Continuing Education at Bergen Community College.\nWhen joining FUSE, a business could become a residential member with a permanent office space or a virtual member with access to space when needed, according to Gillespie. About 15 businesses are residential members at FUSE, including SpeechTrans, a translation company in Lyndhurst with about 25 employees.\nFor about $100 a month, the company has access to all of FUSE's services, including a cubicle and a single-room office.\nMikail Shahjahan, a sales representative at SpeechTrans and a student at BCC, uses the space daily to do work and meet with potential clients.\n\"Clients will feel more likely to work with you when you talk in person,\" said Shahjahan, adding that the business has locations all over the world and also another physical location near Silicon Valley. Using the shareable space helps lower overhead costs for the 5-year-old business \"instead of wasting money on office space when you're just starting out,\" he said.\nEmail: anzidei@northjersey.comTwitter: @melanieanzidei", "external_links": ["http://northjersey.mycapture.com/mycapture/lookup.asp?originalname=MC_070215_B_OfficeShares_kc65.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:08:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
