The crypt comes with original fittings, a TV with a selection of 60 classic horror movies, a \"living\" area (if that's your thing) and a custom-built pine coffin big enough for two.\nThe gated entrance has a lock to keep restless spirits out -- or in -- and there's a vent in the east wall to release gases emitted through decomposition, although your stay might not be long enough to need it.\nAnd what's underneath that concrete slab that held a priest's coffin for more than a century?\n\"Fear itself,\" says Knight. \"I didn't get chills until I looked under that platform.\"\nTales from the crypt\nMonsignor Thomas Wallace was the church's first priest and oversaw its construction.\nHe loved the place so much he had a mortuary chapel and crypt built so he could be buried there.\nIn 1907, he got his wish.\nAfter a 102-year rest, Wallace checked out in 2009 when the church closed and his body was moved to a nearby cemetery.\nA recent eBay auction to be the crypt's first guest since Wallace went for $760.\nChecking out early\nWallace may have been able to rest in peace for over a century, but today's guests need to vacate by 2 a.m.\nThis is due to the risk of bodily disturbance rather than spiritual.\nThe crypt has no toilet, so it's licensed only for entertainment and novelty use.\nThe tomb must be booked in conjunction with lodgings at the main hotel.\nThe more salubrious surroundings of Inn at the Agora.\nThe Haunted Tour package includes a pilgrimage to nearby Bangor, home of Maine's master of the macabre, Stephen King.\nFor those who still have an appetite, there's the option to enjoy a \"last meal\" -- served at midnight of course.\nWith graveyard humor, innkeeper Jan Barratt assures us that the menu isn't \"set in stone.\"\nKnight insists Wallace would be overjoyed to know that the building is being saved and re-purposed.\n\"He'd, at worst, have shrugged it off as a minor annoyance or, at best, laughed at the ridiculousness,\" he says.\nThe crypt's hefty price tag, starting at $290 an evening plus $140 for accommodation at Inn at the Agora, might make some people's blood run cold -- but hey, you only live once.\nInn at the Agora , 1 Walnut Street, Lewiston, ME 04240;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g40708-d7129855-Reviews-m14631-Inn_at_the_Agora-Lewiston_Maine.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-full-169.jpg", "http://www.hotelcrypt.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730114515-crypt-8-inn-at-the-agora-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150730103722-crypt-3-living-area-exlarge-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-31T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T12:40:16.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
