The last country to do so was Zimbabwe in 2001.\nAfter Greece made a last-ditch effort to extend its bailout, eurozone finance ministers decided in a teleconference late Tuesday night that there was no way they could reach a deal before the deadline.\n“It would be crazy to extend the program,” said Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who heads the eurozone finance ministers’ body known as the eurogroup. “So that cannot happen and will not happen.”\n“The program expires tonight,” Dijsselbloem said.\n___\nAP source: US, Cuba to announce plan to open embassies, major step in re-establishing ties\nWASHINGTON — President Barack Obama will announce Wednesday that the U.S. and Cuba have finalized an agreement to reopen embassies in each other’s capitals, a major step in ending hostilities between the Cold War foes, a senior administration official said.\nThe U.S. and Cuba have been negotiating the reestablishment of embassies following the historic December announcement that they would move to restore ties after a half-century of animosity. The U.S. embassy in Havana is expected to open in July.\nFor Obama, ending the U.S. freeze with Cuba is central to his foreign policy legacy as he nears the end of his presidency. Obama has long touted the value of direct engagement with global foes and has argued that the U.S. embargo on the communist island just 90 miles south of Florida was ineffective.\nThe official insisted on anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter ahead of the president.\nThe White House said Obama will deliver a statement on Cuba from the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in Vienna for nuclear negotiations with Iran, is also expected to speak about the embassy openings.\n___\nIMF: Greece misses $1.8 billion payment, becomes first advanced economy to default on IMF loan\nATHENS, Greece — The latest news on Greece’s financial woes (all times local):\n___\n1:21 a.m.\nThe International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a $1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.\nEurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn’t come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan.\n___\nBig income, big taxes: Since 1981, GOP candidate Jeb Bush has paid at rate of 36 percent\nWASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has earned nearly $29 million since leaving the Florida governor’s mansion and paid an effective federal income tax rate of roughly 36 percent in the past three decades, according to tax returns released by his campaign on Tuesday.\nIn an effort designed to show a commitment to transparency, Bush posted the tax returns on a website that outlines his work history since 1981, including most of the time that has passed since the two-term Florida governor left office in 2007. In those recent years, Bush has served on numerous corporate boards and has seen his income rise sharply.\n“Today, I’m releasing 33 years of tax returns — more than any presidential candidate in history,” Bush wrote on the website.\nFrom 2007 to 2013, Bush reported nearly $29 million in total income. His primary occupation during that time was as a consultant, although he also made nearly $10 million giving speeches from 2007 through the end of last year.\nBush earned nearly $7.4 million in total income in 2013, the year covered by the most recent tax return released.\n___\nFight for gay marriage turns now to clerks who defy Supreme Court, refuse marriage licenses\nMOREHEAD, Ky. — Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis shut her blinds at work Tuesday to block the view of rainbow-clad protesters outside. They carried flowers and flags and signs saying “you don’t own marriage.” They chanted “do your job.”\nMoments later, she told a lesbian couple who walked in asking for a license to try another county.\nDavis is among a handful of public officials across the Bible Belt so repulsed by the thought of enabling a same-sex marriage that they are defying the U.S. Supreme Court and refusing to issue a license to anyone, gay or straight.\n“It’s a deep-rooted conviction; my conscience won’t allow me to do that,” Davis told The Associated Press. “It goes against everything I hold dear, everything sacred in my life.”\nSome judges and clerks in Alabama and Texas have done the same, ordering their offices in the name of religious liberty and free speech to issue no marriage licenses at all.\n___\nJennifer Garner, Ben Affleck say they’ve decided to divorce after 10 years of marriage\nLOS ANGELES — As regulars at a local farmer’s market, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and their three young children looked like the perfect Hollywood family.\nThe stars took turns working so they could nurture their careers and their kids — devoted parents who appeared arm-in-arm at countless industry events.\n“It’s work, but it’s the best kind of work,” Affleck famously said of his marriage to Garner when he accepted the best picture Oscar for “Argo.”\nNow, it seems the work is done. After weeks of public speculation about their relationship, the couple announced Tuesday they plan to end their 10-year marriage with a divorce.\n“We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children,” Garner and Affleck said in a joint statement. “This will be our only comment on this private, family matter.”\n___\nChris Christie warns of blunt campaign in 2016 even if it makes people ‘cringe’\nLIVINGSTON, N.J. — A tough-talking New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie launched his 2016 campaign for president Tuesday with a promise to tell voters the truth even if it makes them cringe.\nThe Republican governor, a one-time GOP favorite who faded and now tries to climb back, lashed out at “bickering leaders” from both political parties in a kickoff rally in the gymnasium of his old high school. And in his trademark blunt style, he told voters — and warned Republican rivals — that he’s ready to be aggressive in the 2016 contest.\n“You’re going to get what I think whether you like it or not, or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while or not,” Christie declared. He added: “I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America.”\nHe went on to a town hall meeting in Sandown, New Hampshire, receiving enthusiastic applause from the standing-room crowd as he arrived with his family. “I want to be the next president of the United States and I intend to win this election,” he told the meeting, held in an actual town hall.\nChristie has already held nearly a dozen town halls in New Hampshire, a state key to his hopes, and plans more as he spends the next week in the state.\n___\nIn losing a battle at the Supreme Court, foes see ‘blueprint’ for defeating the death penalty\nATLANTA — A strongly worded dissent in the U.S. Supreme Court’s narrow decision this week upholding the use of an execution drug offered a glimmer of hope to death penalty opponents in what they considered otherwise a gloomy ruling. One advocate went so far Tuesday as to call it a blueprint for a fresh attack on the legality of capital punishment itself.\nBut even those who see Justice Stephen Breyer’s dissent as a silver lining think it will take time to mount a viable challenge.\nAnd Breyer’s words don’t change the fact that the Supreme Court has consistently upheld capital punishment for nearly four decades. The five justices forming the majority in Monday’s decision made it clear they feel that states must somehow be able to carry out the death penalty.\nIn disagreeing with the 5-4 ruling that approved Oklahoma’s use of an execution drug, Breyer, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, called it “highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment,” which protects against cruel and unusual punishment.\n“It was a sweeping and powerful dissent that issues an invitation that we should accept, which is to make the case for why today the death penalty itself is no longer constitutional,” said Cassandra Stubbs, director of the Capital Punishment Project of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n___\nBoston’s still in: USOC leaders decide to stay the course, stick with troubled Beantown bid\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif. — U.S. Olympic Committee leaders say they’re sticking with Boston as their candidate for the 2024 Olympics.\nThe USOC board met Tuesday to discuss the Boston bid, which has been troubled by tepid polling data and active opposition.\nThe announcement came a day after bid leaders unveiled a new, $4.6 billion plan with many financial details that had been missing from earlier renditions.\n“I’ve seen their presentation five times in the last six days, and each time, it keeps getting better,” USOC chairman Larry Probst said.\nProbst and USOC CEO Scott Blackmun were joined at a news conference by new Boston 2024 chairman Steve Pagliuca and co-chair Roger Crandall.\n___\nDon’t blink: Tuesday lasts a second longer to make up for slightly slower Earth rotation\nTuesday lasts a wee bit longer — by a second.\nInternational timekeepers are tacking a second to the clock to compensate for a slightly slower Earth rotation.\nWhile a leap second is hardly enough time to change daily life, it has been known to affect some computer systems in the past.\nThere have been calls to abandon the practice of periodically adding an extra second, which has kept computers synchronized with the Earth day since 1972. The last time was in 2012.\nA decision by a United Nations agency that deals with telecommunications issues isn’t expected until later this year at the earliest.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
