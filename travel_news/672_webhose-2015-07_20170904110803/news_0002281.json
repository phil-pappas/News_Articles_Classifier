Adv: \nJul 16, 2015 Adv: \nWTM London, the world’s leading global event for the travel industry, and the World Food Travel Association (WFTA), the world’s leading authority on food and drink tourism, have partnered to bring the Association’s food travel expertise to this year’s show delegates. \n“We’re delighted to have the opportunity to bring food travel education to WTM. Food and drink have become a critical focus for most travellers,” shared WFTA Executive Director Erik Wolf. “There is a lot that businesses and destinations everywhere can be doing to leverage food and drink as tools for economic development. Food and drink should be the foundation of all tourism development.” \nWTM London, Senior Exhibition Director, Simon Press agreed, “WTM has focused on food tourism in the past, but never to this degree,” said Press. “Interest in food tourism keeps increasing every year making it an ever-important topic for the travel industry”. \nAt the event, Erik Wolf will deliver two sessions. Session 1 will be Food & Drink Travel: The Hidden Harvest, an entertaining and engaging classic that introduces the food tourism industry and its benefits, as well as the demographics and psychographics of food travellers (hint: food travellers are not necessarily who you think they are!) In Session 2, delegates will hear about New Trends in Food & Drink Travel. The formal food tourism industry was founded in 2003, and a lot has changed since then. Consumer interest in food and drink is at an all-time high. Attendees will learn how to leverage those trends for a business or destination. Wolf will share these insights and more. \nProfessionals looking to attend this year’s WTM London can register now for the event at www.WTMLondon.com . \nWorld Travel Market London, the leading global event for the travel industry, is the must-attend four-day business-to-business exhibition for the worldwide travel and tourism industry. \nAlmost 51,500 senior travel industry professionals, government ministers and international press, embark on ExCeL - London every November to network, negotiate and discover the latest industry opinion and trends at WTM London. \nWTM London, now in its 36th year, is the event where the travel industry conducts and concludes its deals. \nWTM London 2014 will generate around £2.5 billion of travel industry contracts. \nWorld Travel Market London is part of Reed Travel Exhibition’s World Travel Market group of events, which also includes Arabian Travel Market, World Travel Market Latin America and World Travel Market Africa. www.wtmworld.com . \nWTM is owned by the worldʼs leading events organiser Reed Exhibitions (RE), which also organises other portfolios of travel industry events including IBTM Events, the world’s leading showcases for the meetings and events industry and International Luxury Travel Market events. \nIn 2014, RE held more than 500 events in 40 countries bringing together more than six million people from around the world generating billions of dollars in business. \nThe World Food Travel Association (WFTA) is a non-profit and non-governmental organization (NGO) and is recognized as the world’s leading authority on food tourism.
