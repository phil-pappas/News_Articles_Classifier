As the founder of Made for Spain, a custom trip planner in Madrid , she creates itineraries that show travelers the best of her country; savoring a lengthy midday meal as the locals do is one of her top recommendations.\nSpain is already a popular spot, but the strength of the dollar against the euro means it is even more so now. Ms. Irurita, 52, has plenty of insight on how to take advantage of the lower prices, what places tourists should not miss and how to experience a getaway to her homeland like a Spaniard.\nFollowing are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Irurita.\nWhat can travelers to Spain expect this year when it comes to prices?\nThey’ll definitely be able to experience more than they would have last year without spending more. They can take additional tours, do more shopping and go to high-end restaurants they might not want to usually splurge on.\nWhat else would you like travelers to know?\nPhoto Ms. Irurita advises slowing down and seeing Spain like a Spaniard. This is a country that has something for everyone, whether you’re a beach lover, culture lover or serious wine drinker. Also, we truly enjoy life and are social animals and want people who come here to embrace that laid-back lifestyle.\nHow exactly does one do that?\nSit down for a long lunch and make it your biggest meal of the day. Enjoy a glass of wine and take a short siesta after you eat. Hang out at a cafe in the afternoon and mingle with locals. Instead of rushing around to every attraction, walk everywhere as we love to do. You might see fewer sights, but you’ll be more immersed in the scene.\nIs there a certain time of the year you recommend visiting?\nThe spring and fall. Winters are cold and summers are quite hot. Also, the beaches get very busy. Traveling off-season is a luxury because you won’t have the crowds or weather working against you.\nWhat is the next must-visit city?\nMadrid. Tourists tend to linger in Barcelona and pass quickly through Madrid, but it is booming and worth a longer stay. There are food markets like San Miguel and Platea, museums like the Romanticism, which was just renovated, and new hotels and boutiques like the ones in the De las Letras area. There is always something new to discover. Just in March, the remains of Cervantes, who wrote “Don Quixote,” were found, and now there are plans in the works to have travelers visit his tomb.\nAre there any unsung but worthwhile places to visit in the country?\nThe northern part around the Asturias region is our best kept secret and where Spaniards vacation. Forget going to the beaches on the Mediterranean; the ones here are long with soft, white sand and beautiful, clean water. The area also has the Picos de Europa mountain range, spectacular scenery and amazing food, including mountain cheeses and all sorts of beef. Throw in the great prices, and it’s unbeatable.\nIs there a clichéd touristy experience you wish travelers would avoid?\nPeople think that tapas are Spanish and want to eat them wherever they go. Of course you can find them everywhere, but tapas are only from Madrid and Andalusia. They are not part of the culture in Barcelona, where the locals have an aperitivo or vermouth with some pickled vegetables, or in San Sebastián or Bilbao, where pintxos — thin baguette slices with different toppings like ham, vegetables and crab meat mixed with red pepper — are the tradition.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26QA1/26QA1-master315.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/26/travel/26QA1/26QA1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.madeforspain.com/"], "published": "2015-07-21T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:47:09.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
