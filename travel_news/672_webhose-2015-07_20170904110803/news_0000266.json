He really waited for that bad ball throughout the whole day.”\nHaddin lets go of Root 0:49 Play video\nThe Ashes: Brad Haddin has let Joe Root off the hook as Mitchell Starc begins to find his groove in the first session.\nFox Sports 08 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes Root’s 134 was his second Ashes hundred and the seventh of a blossoming career where he already averages over 50 from his 27 Tests.\nHe came to the crease with England reeling at 3-43, but despite giving a chance when on nought, Root refused to be tied down and took the fight to Australia with 17 fours.\nRoot has gone from Australia’s bunny to their worst nightmare.\n“There are going to be opportunities to score because they’re going to have aggressive fields,” said Root.\n“It could have gone completely the other way and got out second ball and you look a bit silly.\n“First of all (the motivation after being dropped from the last Ashes) was to get back into the side and then contribute as much as I could.\n“It was a feeling I don’t want to ever go through again but in this sport you have to deal with hard times and show a lot of self-belief and self-confidence to overcome them.”\nEngland's Joe Root kisses the badge in his helmet as he celebrates a century applauded by Australia's Shane Watson, left, and Brad Haddin. Source: AP\nRoot scored two hundreds in the recent ODI series against New Zealand as well as a 98 in the first Test against the Black Caps.\nHis only previous Ashes hundred came in eerily similar circumstances, when he gave a chance through slips on 8 only to go on and post 180 in England’s giant second Test win at Lord’s back in 2013.\nRoot praised the grit shown by under-fire No. 3 Gary Ballance (61) to weather an early storm as the Yorkshire pair combined for a crucial 153-run stand.\nHe said it was too early to write off Mitchell Johnson despite his slow start to the series.\nASHES PODCAST: Former Test spinner Stuart MacGill and former England all-rounder Derek Pringle analyse the first of the 2015 Ashes series on the Fox Sports Cricket Podcast.
