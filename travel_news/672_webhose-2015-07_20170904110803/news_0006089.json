The main summer travel period of July 1 to August 31, 2015 served as the basis of comparison. \nIn coming up with the rankings, the survey used the average cost of each location's cheapest available double room. The prices mentioned therefore reflect the minimum amount travelers can expect to pay at the hotel check-in counter at each respective destination this summer. The survey considered only those hotels with a central location and with a rating of at least 2 stars. \nVisitors to Newport, Rhode Island will have to spend, on average, $226 per night for a double room this summer. Only two destinations are more expensive: 1) Provincetown, located in Cape Cod, Massachusetts and 2) Kennebunkport, situated in Maine's York County. Average rates of $247 and $234 nightly, respectively, secured these locales the survey's number one and two spots. \nProvidence, the capital and most populous city in Rhode Island, ranks 12th most expensive in New England. An average overnight price tag of $157 for its least expensive double room put the city just outside the Top 10. \nThe following table ranks the 10 most expensive destinations in New England this summer. The prices shown reflect the average rate for each destination's cheapest available double room for the time period spanning July 1 through August 31, 2015. \n1.
