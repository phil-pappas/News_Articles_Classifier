Our guide features expert recommendations for city , beach , villa , culture , food and drink and activity holidays. All prices are for the cheapest double room in spring or summer unless stated otherwise. They are subject to availability. 1. Urville-Nacqueville, Normandy A short drive or cycle from Cherbourg brings you swiftly to idyllic coastal countryside and sweeping expanses of fine sand. Just west of Urville-Nacqueville, itself 10km west of the ferry port and a popular bathing station a century ago, the veteran Hôtel Landemer reopened last year following a stunning restoration. Bright, up-to-the-minute rooms with polished-oak floors look out over the Channel, and you can dine outside on a decked terrace. There’s surfing, windsurfing, sailing and diving nearby, as well as horse riding, and the long-distance GR223 footpath passes the hotel as it circles the Cotentin peninsula. Double rooms at Hôtel Landemer from £110 (00 33 2330 40 510; le-landemer.com ). Assun Voile offers watersports (00 33 2330 33 052; assunvoile.com ), and Centre Equestre de la Valette horse riding (00 33 2330 35 769; centre-equestre-lavalette.com ). Check availability: Hôtel Landemer, Urville-Nacquevill Greg Ward 2. Étretat, Normandy Quirky little Étretat, the most scenic spot on Normandy ’s chalky northern coastline, is sandwiched between spectacularly eroded cliffs. With its gingerbread architecture and stately promenade, it oozes Belle-Époque charm; you half-expect to find horse-drawn bathing huts on its shingle beach, though in fact it offers 21st-century activities such as paddleboarding. Choose from two contrasting hotels: at the Domaine Saint-Clair, an opulent Anglo-Norman castle, rooms named after the likes of Marcel Proust and Sarah Bernhardt are swathed in rich draperies, while those at the cheaper, eco-friendly Détective in town pay humorous tribute to assorted fictional investigators, from Hercule Poirot to Inspector Clouseau and even Charlie’s Angels. Double rooms from £120 at the Domaine Saint-Clair (00 33 2352 70 823; hoteletretat.com ), £55 at the Détective (00 33 2352 70 134; detectivehotel.com ). Check availability: Domaine Saint-Clair / Détective, Étretat GW Étretat is the most scenic spot on Normandy’s chalky northern coastline (Photo: AP) 3. Sainte-Marine, Brittany Best accessed by a five-minute ferry ride across the River Odet from better-known Bénodet, the little port of Sainte-Marine cradles a lovely crescent of fine sand. Perched amid neat lawns above the jetty, the century-old Villa Tri Men surveys what’s been called the prettiest river in France. It’s now a sumptuous hotel, with bright, spacious bedrooms, many with balconies, plus a superb restaurant; there are also private cottages in the grounds. Ten minutes’ walk south, by way of sheltered coves tucked into the riverbank, brings you to the mouth of the Odet, where a supremely unspoiled beach, the Plage du Teven, stretches west for four long kilometres. Double rooms at Villa Tri Men from £135; cottages from £180 (00 33 2985 19 494; trimen.fr ). Check availability: Villa Tri Men, Sainte-Marine GW 4. Trégastel, Brittany Brittany ’s Côte de Granit Rose is an irresistible playground for family holidays. Peppered with golden-sand beaches, interspersed with headlands of tangled woods and heather, it’s adorned throughout with glistening pink-granite boulders, eroded into strange shapes and stacked in gravity-defying disarray. Tiny Trégastel centres on one of its largest and prettiest beaches, beautifully illuminated each evening by the setting sun. The seafront Hôtel Beau Séjour offers great-value rooms with jaunty seaside décor, including an excellent family suite with a large rooftop deck, plus a good restaurant and crêperie. Best of all, the owners also run a bakery; the breakfast buffet spread of fresh-baked breads and pastries has to be seen to be believed. Double rooms at Hôtel Beau Séjour from £62; breakfast £8.50 per person (00 33 2962 38 802; beausejoursarl.com ). Check availability: Hôtel Beau Séjour, Trégastel GW 5. Plage de Gatseau, Île d’Oléron The Île d’Oléron is off the radar of most British holidaymakers, despite the fact that much of the coastline of France’s second-largest island has undeveloped sandy beaches backed by dunes and pine woods. Miles of beach extend along the south-west coast, with acres of space for ball games at low tide, and often good surf for body boarding. But Oléron’s prettiest strand is the more intimate Plage de Gatseau near St-Trojan-les-Bains: overlooking the channel between the island and mainland, its soft sand is spattered with shells. Oléron Les Pins Indigo Campsite is a delightful, back-to-nature site set in a pine forest, 10 minutes by bike (rentals available) from Plage de Gatseau. Pitches from £12 per night, pre-erected tents from £39, plus £17 booking fee (0033 4 37 64 22 34; camping-indigo.com ). Fred Mawer 6. Conche des Baleines, Île de Ré On the Île de Ré, you’re spoilt for choice for long, sandy beaches. For the most memorable, head to the far west – to Conche des Baleines, a vast crescent of golden sand, and the less well-known and more protected Trousse-Chemise, great for rock pooling. Both are fringed by pine woods that make ideal picnic spots. If you don’t want to shlep all the way out west, miles of dune-backed beaches, usually offering good body boarding, run along the south coast. Get a tide timetable: the beaches diminish to thin and in places overcrowded strips at high tide. But beaches are just one element of the Île de Ré’s appeal. Other draws include beautiful, carefully preserved villages, gourmet food markets, a striking landscape of saltpans, marshes and vineyards, and the fact that you can explore everywhere by bike on the many miles of cycle lanes. Wake up in France has a good selection of villas and houses on the Île de Ré. From £840 a week for a two-bedroom villa (0033 2 51 59 78 00; wakeupinfrance.co.uk ). FM 7. Gruissan, Languedoc To the south of Narbonne, the flat, unkempt Languedoc littoral suddenly sprouts the rocks of the Clape Massif. This is a most welcome development. Tucked in below the massif is the little town of Gruissan, my favourite along this stretch of coast where new-build is the norm. Gruissan has a proper old centre, spiralling out from its castle. Beyond, more modern seaside requisites (bars, boats, blow-up dolphins) give way to a tangle of lagoons, marshland and outstanding beaches. Nearby are other, more remote, sands at Serignan and Portiragnes, plus great walking and wine among the ridges and smoky pines of the Clape hills. Best wine of all comes from Château Le Bouis. Here, just back from Gruissan, is a 300-year-old winery looking out over vines and sea, where - isn’t life well-planned? - one may also stay in what was the wine-maker’s manor house. In high summer the old stones also host a restaurant. I wouldn’t hesitate. Double rooms at Château Le Bouis from £75 (0033 468 752525; chateaulebouis.com ). Check availability: Château Le Bouis, Gruissan Anthony Peregrine Gruissan (Photo: AP/Fotolia) 8. Argeles-sur-Mer, Languedoc Oh, the joys of a proper seaside family holiday - the sea, the sand, the laughter of children, the sitting and occasional reading, the unbridled pleasure of being all together somewhere warm and bright, with the agenda empty but for romping. Follow me, then, to Argeles-sur-Mer, where the long, flat coast bumps into the final descent of the Pyrenees. Here is a six-mile beach, as wide as a desert to the north, bouncier in the middle and edging to creeks further south. The village is as jolly and brazen as a summer resort should be, and surrounded by scores of campsites. These include the five-star La Sirène, less a trad campsite, more leafy suburbia studded with chalets, facilities, the biggest and most interesting water park I’ve ever seen, bars, restaurants, surprisingly good night-time entertainment and a happy sense of holiday fun well-marshalled. If my kids were younger, I’d be there already. Accommodation for a family of four from £33 (0033 468 810461; camping-lasirene.fr ). AP 9. Cavalaire-sur-Mer, Provence Cavalaire-sur-Mer is as close to St Tropez as anyone needs to be, yet terribly different. The place has the same sea, sun and insouciance but with no A-list exclusivity or prices that challenge billionaires. Here families are to the fore, with a safe main beach one cannot see the end of, and every maritime activity known to man, bar buccaneering. Diving is particularly rewarding. Slightly farther along are creeks, more discreet beaches and a dramatic coastal trek to Cap Lardier, which underlines that the Riviera can still be wild and elemental. Directly behind, the Maures mountains whisk you away from sea-sidery to tougher times in the twist of a hairpin. Best bet for the family may be a campsite, and the best is the Camping de la Baie. Run by the same family for 60 years, it is, unusually, bang in the town centre (though you’d never guess once you’re in). Chalet (sleeping four) from £535 a week (0033 494 640815; camping-baie.com ). AP Plage de Pardignon, Cavalaire (Photo: AP/ Fotolia) 10. Menton, Provence Menton is the thinking person’s Côte-d’Azur. As required, it has the lazy sunshine zest, two vast beaches of sand and shingle, unambiguous light and Alps dropping direct to the sea - but without the airhead assumptions of more ring-a-ding spots farther west. Wintering British nobles long ago set a tone, establishing gardens, good manners and Belle-Epoque elegance. These flourish on Mediterranean roots. The labyrinthine Latin old town climbs around Baroque churches steeply up its hill. Italy’s at the end of the Prom. Thus we have the best of all worlds - and art in the new-ish Jean Cocteau Museum, should the sand, sun and sea fail to supply an aesthetic challenge. The resort is realistically accessible by rail if you’re going for long enough. A week, say. Any less would be silly, anyway. The French Travel Service has a seven-night b & b stay in a good three-star hotel, rail travel from London included. From £590pp (0844 8488 843; f-t-s.co.uk ).
