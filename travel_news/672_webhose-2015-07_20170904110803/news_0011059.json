Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK) has been rapidly pulling in passengers as it competes against much-larger rival Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), with Alaska Airlines passengers up 9.7 percent in the first half of the year. The growth in flights has been accompanied by slightly more empty seats, with 84.6 percent of Alaska seats filled, off 1.6 percent. On-time arrivals also were off, by 1.1 percent. To be sure, Seattle-based Alaska seems to be staying ahead of Delta in on-time performance. According to the most recent comparative numbers from the U.S. Department of Transportation, 89.3 percent of Alaska’s flights were on time in April, compared to 86.8 percent of Delta’s. Business Pulse Delta has been wooing the tech community in a promotional campaign. While executives of both airlines have insisted they can coexist and survive, Delta’s massive entry into Alaska’s primary Seattle market since 2012 has sparked a lively competition. Alaska has responded in many ways, including by offering more flights. Just in the first half of the year it raised available seat miles, a common measure of capacity, by 11.2 percent to 17.3 million seats. The data shows how much bigger Atlanta-based Delta is. Excluding its huge international network, Delta offered 58.5 million seat miles domestically in the first six months of the year, a figure that rises to 71.3 million if regional flight are included. When Alaska and its sister airline Horizon Air are considered together, the comparative number is 19.2 million, or about 27 percent that of Delta. The big question is how much Alaska’s stretch to meet Delta will impact its bottom line. So far Alaska is doing well, and in the first quarter of 2015 Alaska revenues climbed 4 percent to $1.3 billion over the same period of the year before, and net income was up 58 percent to $149 million. Second quarter numbers come out July 23. \nWant Seattle Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
