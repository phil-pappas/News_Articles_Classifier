Ms Lewis-Smith confirmed her team had beaten fierce international competition to win this event and pointed to strong growth of Asian tourism benefiting local business events. \n“BESydney has injected A$213 million into the economy by securing and delivering more than 45,000 Asian incentive delegates into NSW over the past three years. And, we’ve experienced a 20 per cent year-on-year growth in this sector in NSW over the past decade. “Last year, 858,500 Chinese tourists arrived in Australia, spending more than $5 billion, and many came to attend a business event or join an incentive program. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates suggest the Asian middle class will surge from 600 million to three billion within 20-30 years, with aspirational opportunities such as international travel, expected to grow. NSW Minister for Trade, Tourism and Major Events, Stuart Ayres MP, welcomed Amway China to Sydney. “Our doors are open to our Chinese neighbours who we welcome to Sydney in 2017 for the Amway China Leadership Seminar to be held at International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney). “I’m pleased Amway China has chosen NSW again after their 2005 and 2011 Sydney events were amongst the most successful they’ve ever held anywhere in the world,” Mr Ayres said. The Associate Director of Special Events of Amway China, Mr Charming Cao, confirmed Amway China’s reasons for choosing Sydney. “We aim to motivate our Amway China team to reach and exceed their sales targets, knowing that their reward will be an exciting trip to the always beautiful and thrilling city of Sydney. “Our delegates will experience the modern, world-class facilities of the newly-opened ICC Sydney and an exciting, appealing program of activities,” Mr Cao said. “Amway China delegates reported a 93 per cent satisfaction rating during their last visits to Sydney and we look forward to inspiring and entertaining our delegates again in 2017.” Destination NSW CEO Sandra Chipchase said her agency was delighted to have assisted Business Events Sydney in securing the event for NSW. “China is the number one visitor market for NSW and we’re pleased that Destination NSW’s efforts and support have helped to secure this event which will see more than 10,000 delegates travel to Sydney and NSW. “ICC Sydney will be Australia’s largest and most impressive events space, and securing the coveted Amway China Leadership Seminar for this state-of-the-art facility reinforces Sydney’s international reputation for hosting major events,” Ms Chipchase said. ICC Sydney CEO Geoff Donaghy said he and his team were excited and proud to be hosting Amway China’s delegates during this important event for Sydney. “The Amway China Leadership Seminar is shaping up to be ICC Sydney’s first major incentive event in 2017 and we couldn’t be more excited to be hosting an event of such prestige, scale and importance. It is certainly an event befitting of the capability and grandeur of the new ICC Sydney,” Mr Donaghy said. Tourism Australia CEO John O’Sullivan confirmed Tourism Australia supported efforts to help secure the event for Australia. “We are extremely pleased that Amway China has selected Sydney and Australia for their Leadership Seminar 2017. Congratulations to BESydney on securing this significant incentive event,” Mr O’Sullivan said.
