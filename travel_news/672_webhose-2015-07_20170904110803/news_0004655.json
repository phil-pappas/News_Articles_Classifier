Huxter has offered to work closely and hand in hand with the new owners to achieve a smooth transfer. “Le Quartier Français has always been about family. It is a very special place full of soul, happiness and above all else wonderful people,” she said. “Between us all we have 924 years of service with two generations working here. It is the people that make Le Quartier Français the special place it is. I feel it is the right time to pass on this sanctuary to a new family who will love it and treasure it. I also believe there lies an exciting time ahead for the Le Quartier Français team, a wonderful opportunity for them to grow and spread their wings and I will be watching from around the corner.” Award-winning Executive Chef Margot Janse will also see to it that the magic continues at The Tasting Room with her cutting edge cuisine. She, along with the rest of the Le Quartier Français team, will ensure that the exceptional service and experiences continue to charm guests from around the world. This latest acquisition forms part of Leeu Collection, the manifestation of owner Analjit Singh’s (aka BAS) vision for sophisticated escapes and unique wineland experiences, which comprises in the first phase, Leeu Estates, a 21 room, five-star luxurious boutique hotel and winery in the Franschhoek valley, and Leeu House, an exclusive and private five-star 12-room boutique hotel in the heart of the Franschhoek village, set for a phased opening from the last quarter of 2015. According to BAS, the respected Le Quartier Français brand will be kept as is and for now only changes such as soft refurbishments and landscaping developments will take place. Further additions and alterations will be considered in 2016. “I am passionate about South Africa, its energy and sense of place,” says Singh. Leeu means lion in Afrikaans as does Singh in Sanskrit. “This latest acquisition makes me excited because I love to be part of creating something special. The team involved in the Leeu Collection portfolio, headed by Hector de Galard, shares this excitement and is determined to create world-class experiences in a luxurious environment of which Le Quartier Français will form a part. This opportunity is a natural for us,” he said. Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:42:55.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
