Zipsters will have the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the first two episodes of the network's critically-acclaimed hit series' third season, prior to the season three premiere on Sunday, July 12 on SHOWTIME. \nIn 2013, Zipcar and SHOWTIME teamed up for similar drive-in screenings which received rave reviews by attending Zipsters. This year, Zipcar members in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. will have the chance to attend this special drive-in screening of RAY DONOVAN in their Zipcars on Wednesday, July 8 at 8:00 p.m. Zipsters are encouraged to reserve a car and a space for the evening's event by visiting: www.zipcar.com/drivein . \nThe drive-in events will take place at top-secret locations to be revealed the week of the screening. Zipcar drivers and passengers will be treated to free concessions including food trucks or catering, a photo-booth and an opportunity to take photos in luxury cars prior to watching the episodes. \n\"This exclusive drive-in screening is yet another example of the benefits of being a Zipcar member,\" said Zipcar Chief Marketing Officer Brian Harrington. \"Drive-in movies are the ultimate outdoor summer activity to be enjoyed with family and friends—and Zipcar gives you the freedom to get you there.\" \nRAY DONOVAN stars two-time Golden Globe® and Emmy®nominee Liev Schreiber as LA's best professional fixer, the man called in to make the city's celebrities, superstar athletes and business moguls' most complicated and combustible situations go away. Season three finds Ray adrift from his family and those closest to him, while he focuses on his business and desires to be his own boss. Meanwhile, his father Mickey (Jon Voight, in his Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning role), who had narrowly escaped last season's heist debacle, finds himself charting a similar course to build his own empire. Joining the show this season are guest stars Ian McShane and Katie Holmes, with Elliott Gould returning. The cast also includes Paula Malcomson, Eddie Marsan, Dash Mihok, Steven Bauer, Katherine Moennig, Pooch Hall, Kerris Dorsey and Devon Bagby. A SHOWTIME production, the series is executive produced by David Hollander, Mark Gordon and Bryan Zuriff, and created by Ann Biderman. \nZipcar gives its members on-demand access to a variety of cars in hundreds of cities, airports and college campuses worldwide.
