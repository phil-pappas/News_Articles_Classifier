We have worked so hard for this,” said Chile star Arturo Vidal.\nThe midfielder said Chile had been determined to win the Copa América after exiting the World Cup last year on penalties.\n“We talked about it in Brazil that we were going to win the Copa América,” Sánchez said. “This is really a great generation, we deserve this.”\nBut it was another crushing loss for Messi, almost a year after Argentina lost the World Cup final to Germany in Brazil.\nThe game went to penalties after a hard-fought 120 minutes ended in stalemate, with neither side managing to unlock their opposite defense.\nChile started at a ferocious pace before Argentina gradually managed to gain a foothold in the game.\nMessi, invariably tracked by two or three red jerseys throughout, almost played Sergio Aguero in with a superb pass in the sixth minute but Chile was able to clear the threat.\nAt the other end Chile came closest to opening the scoring early on when Vidal volleyed a deflected Sánchez cross goalwards, with Romero diving to save.\nThe desperation of both sides often threatened to cross the line, with some full-blooded tackles drawing the ire of Colombian referee Wilmar Roldán.\nChile midfielder Charles Aránguiz was lucky to escape a caution for a cynical hack on Angel Di Maria who later limped out of the contest on 29 minutes to be replaced by Ezequiel Lavezzi.\nWhile Chile pressed forward relentlessly and launched a series of forays into Argentinian territory, it was the tournament favorites who had the better chances in the first half.\nArgentina almost grabbed an opener in the 20th minute when Sergio Aguero met a Messi free-kick with a close range header that Bravo parried away.\nOn the stroke of half-time Argentina probed again and Javier Pastore set up Lavezzi whose shot was blocked by Bravo.\nThe second half followed a similar pattern, with clear-cut chances thin on the ground as defenses remained on top.\nSánchez went close for Chile on 82 minutes but hooked his volley just wide of the post.\nArgentina almost snatched a dramatic victory in the dying seconds with a well-worked move that began after Messi skipped clear of the Chile defense and released Lavezzi on the left flank.\nLavezzi found Higuaín — on for Aguero — at the far post but the Napoli striker couldn’t finish from a tight angle and shot into the side netting as Chile escaped.\nIn extra-time Sánchez almost punished a rare slip by Javier Mascherano but shot over the bar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T08:50:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
