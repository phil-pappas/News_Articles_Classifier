It seems like the last two, three, four years it’s exploded again .\" \nPeople who witness wildlife feedings are asked to report these instances to authorities, including license plate numbers and a photo of the vehicle or person, if possible. \nTo report wildlife feeding, call 1-888-WARDENS (927-3367).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:13:58.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
