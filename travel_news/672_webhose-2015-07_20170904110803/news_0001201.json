The Thracian burial tumulus Malka Arsenalka mound, dated back the end of 5th century BC. Source: AFP \nIN THE fields of Bulgaria they are everywhere — hundreds of mounds like huge molehills concealing the gold-filled tombs of ancient kings who left no other trace of their rule. \nKnown as tumuli, the burial mounds are the only remnants of the Thracian civilisation that inhabited the Balkan Peninsula from the 2nd millennium BC to the 3rd century AD. \nThe accidental discovery of a tomb in 1944 revealed that the earthen structures were in fact man-made and that the burial monuments hidden within contained intricately crafted treasures. \nExperts believe there are more than 15,000 of these tombs in Bulgaria, a tenth of them in the so-called Valley of the Thracian Kings near the central town of Kazanlak. \nMany of the tombs have been looted, but a collection of surviving gold, silver and bronze objects are being shown at the Louvre museum in Paris until July 20.

I hope that more money will come and we can restore and open them,” Parvin said. \nEarth goddess \nThe Thracians were a people of horse and cattle breeders, metal miners and goldsmiths who are believed to have had no alphabet of their own and left no written records. \nThey believed in the afterlife and the immortality of the soul, and buried deceased rulers with their horses, dogs, weapons, drinking cups and even playing dice.

That is the reason why we think that they built these artificial mounds around their funeral structures,” she said. \nIn addition to the treasures, the bushy tumuli also conceal a variety of exquisite burial monuments. \nBuilt from huge granite blocks or bricks, they consist of a corridor and one or more chambers, with each revealing its own meticulous design and ornamentation.

The remains of six other rooms surround the burial chamber, none of which have been restored as yet. A mural of a woman's face in the burial chamber in a Ostrusha tumulus.
