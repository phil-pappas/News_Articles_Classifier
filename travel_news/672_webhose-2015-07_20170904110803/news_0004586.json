A firm plan, however, is still being worked out,” an airline representative said. \nThe present 235-seater B777-200LRs are currently in three-class configurations with first, business and economy class, though the proposed reconfiguring of the aircraft would eliminate first class, and reduce some seats from the business class, according to the airline source. \nAir India initially acquired eight Boeing 777-200LRs as part of its 67 aircraft order from Boeing in 2006, though has since sold off five of these to Etihad Airways, while keeping the remaining three in its fleet. \nOur analysis of OAG Schedules Analyser data over the past ten years shows that Air India began flying to North America in 2007, where it operated a route to New York’s JFK three-times-weekly. In 2010, the airline also began operating to Newark, Chicago and Toronto within the same year, all of which have witnessed an increase in available seat capacity, apart from Toronto which was cancelled in 2012. \nThe airline now operates almost 380,000 seats between the North America and India, with an equal share in capacity between Newark, JFK and Chicago. \neTN is a media partner for Routes.
