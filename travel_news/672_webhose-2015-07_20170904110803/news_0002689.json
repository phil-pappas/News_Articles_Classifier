The experience of watching these historical landmarks, in this great ancient city, is beyond description. One such site, which lived beyond its expectations, was the Roman Pantheon. This building is possibly the most conserved and perhaps the most important building of ancient Rome. Once a temple dedicated to all the gods of Pagan Rome, is now a famous tourist site, which defines Rome and its ancient political and cultural dominance. The Emperor Hadrian built the current Pantheon to replace the one initially built by Commander Marcus Agrippa’s Pantheon of 27 B.C. which was burnt to ground somewhere around 80 A.D. However, the Pantheon, like other architectural marvels built by Hadrian, does not have his name inscribed. The Pantheon has been credited to its original creator Marcus Agrippa. Another important fact is that the architect of this place is unknown. \nThe formation of the Pantheon is comprised of a succession of interconnecting arches. The dome, on top of the Phaethon, is supported by a sequence of arches that run parallel to each other. Romans had mastered the use of arches which helped to uphold the weight of their structures. The sculpture of Augustus and Agrippa stand at the end of the walkway down the aisles of the entrance. The interior design of the Roman Pantheon is a remarkable fusion of custom and modernism. One of the most striking features of this building is its dome, which in ancient times would have been covered with gold or precious metals, in order to make it look heavenly. The dome is hollow from the centre (oculus). This oculus is the biggest of its kind found within any ancient roman buildings. As the day progresses the light enters and shines on different interior parts of the structure, which makes it look even more sacred. Moreover, the oculus is not covered even when it is raining and the drainage system beneath the Pantheon is still working in an excellent condition. \nThe ancient use of Pantheon is unclear. Although, it is categorized as an ancient temple, I am inclined to think otherwise. Firstly, the structure of the building is different from other ancient Roman temples and secondly, it is uncertain how people could worship in a building constructed in this manner. However, it was used as a church under the Byzantine rule. Emperor Phocas gave it to Pope Boniface the VIII in 608 A.D. Besides serving as a Church, the Pantheon is also a tomb for famous Italian Kings (Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I) and Raphael (Renaissance painter) and his fiancé. In short, the Roman Pantheon is a magnificent example of second century Roman construction. The building itself is a work of mathematical genius and still fascinates architects around the word as a work of art. \nI next turned towards Istanbul in Turkey to witness another historical architectural marvel. Hagaia Sophia is a standing souvenir of the great Byzantine Empire which stretched across Europe and had a great fascination with construction beautiful buildings. This was initially built as a small wooden church by Emperor Constantine. Numerous small churches, such as the initial Hagai Sophia, were built all across Constantine’s empire in order to spread Christianity. However, with time, this place went under momentous transformations and it was the most famous Byzantine emperor, Justinian the Great, who built this fascinating building as a testament to his devotion for Christianity. \nHagia Sophia combines Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Persian influence into one distinctive style. Its main features and outlook have a long rectangular nave and a rounded apse facing east and in a way are very similar to that of most other cathedrals. However, the interior is truly a work of art and consists of marble paved floors and columns. It consists of long galleries which have been decorated with impressive mosaics. Besides all this, Hagia Sophia is famous for its huge domed roof which is astonishing. The roof is made up of black led and stretches about one hundred and sixty feet into the air. Another fascinating feature of dome is that it is surrounded by forty arched windows. These windows are made up of thousands of gold, silver and glass tiles and let in natural light. It appears as if the dome is floating in mid-air. This is essentially what separates Hagia Sophia from other cathedrals and makes the experience of travelling to this location worthwhile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:23:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
