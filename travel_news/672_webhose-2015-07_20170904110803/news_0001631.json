He joined the Golf Channel 15 years later.\nArapahoe House's president and chief executive officer, Art Schut, says Feherty's remarks will include anecdotes from his golfing days — highlights of which include winning the 1991 Ryder Cup and captaining the Irish team that won the 1990 Alfred Dunhill Cup — as well as his life as a recovering alcoholic.\n\"Alcohol continues to be the number one drug of abuse in the U.S. and Colorado,\" Schut notes. \"Having David Feherty share his story of alcoholism and recovery will create important awareness about a drug that is very much an issue in our culture.\"\nFeherty has said that he didn't stop drinking because he was a bad drunk. \"I quit because I was a spectacular drunk. It got to be like a video game, where you get to the highest level and it's not even a challenge.\"\nFeherty, a native of Northern Ireland, also is the author of six books. His latest is the New York Times bestseller, \"The Power of Positive Idiocy,\" which describes his perspective on addiction.", "external_links": ["http://www.golfchannel.com/about/bio/david-feherty/"], "published": "2015-07-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T12:32:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
