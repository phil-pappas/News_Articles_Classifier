These non-surgical interventions reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in the upper face, resulting in relaxed, more youthful-looking skin. Their rejuvenating effects are visible within days and can be expected to last up to four months. The dermal filler treatments target smile, lip and marionette lines and can be used for lip enhancement. These treatments take advantage of hyaluronic acid, a substance that occurs naturally in the skin, to smooth, soften and replace lost volume, restoring a youthful radiance to the lower face. The results are immediate and typically last up to ten months. \nAll ships on MSC Cruises' fleet benefit from the unique MSC Aurea Spa, a truly authentic Balinese-style spa, with all treatments designed exclusively for MSC Cruises. Within an MSC Aurea Spa, guests are looked after by expert Balinese masseuses, beauty therapists, manicurists, pedicurists, hair stylists, and a dedicated spa doctor. On MSC Divina – one of the line's newest ships, which will cruise to the Caribbean year-round from Miami starting November 2015 – guests can choose from 21 different kinds of massages from Shiatsu to Thai, 13 body treatments from thalassotherapy scrubs to hot lava stone treatments, and eight facials. Signature treatments on board include the Aurea Del Mare, which is a massage that incorporates sea shells, and the Himalayan Dream, which is a massage that incorporates fossil salts done on a special bed actually made of the salt. The MSC Aurea Spa also features six custom Shu Uemura hair treatments – a hair & beauty ceremony inspired by Japanese tradition. \nOn the fitness side, all MSC Aurea Spas are equipped with a state-of the-art gym with personal trainers and yoga instructors. In addition, MSC Divina is the first cruise ship in the world to offer its passengers Aqua Cycling at sea – allowing guests to get a workout, while having fun and trying something different. \nMSC Cruises and Growth Plans \nMSC Cruises is an ambitious young line that grew 800% in its first 10 years to become the fourth largest cruise company in the industry. The Company is set to double its fleet capacity by 2022, through a $5.5 billion investment plan, which includes orders for seven ships in two state-of-the-art prototypes. \nOf these ships, MSC Cruises recently announced the opening of sales for MSC Meraviglia's inaugural cruises – the company's first next-generation ship, which is part of the above-mentioned investment plan. As of June 2017, MSC Meraviglia will cruise in the Mediterranean, departing from Barcelona, Genoa or Marseille. The second next-generation ship currently under construction, MSC Seaside, will cruise to the Caribbean from Miami, starting in December 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:47.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
