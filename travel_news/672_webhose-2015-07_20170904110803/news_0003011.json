I’m a nervous flyer at the best of times. \n“As we were landing, as soon as the plane’s wheels touched the ground, the window fell out and landed on my lap. I was scared and frightened. I got off the flight completely bewildered. \n“Staff were very apologetic and said it was ‘unacceptable’.” \nLaurence, who was traveling back from Poland after a week-long trip, said the window reveal grazed his hand when it fell. \nHe said he handed back the broken window pane to cabin crew staff after the incident. \nHe paid £144 for the return flight to Poland and flew home on a jet without the company’s logo on the side. \nHe added: “The plane looked a bit dilapidated and I was nervous as it took off. It was not the usual Ryanair standard.” \nA Ryanair spokesman confirmed the incident. \nThey said: “We note the dislodging of this window reveal (which is used only to protect the window from scratches) and have asked the operator of this lease-in aircraft (Air Explore) to ensure that it does not recur.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:50.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
