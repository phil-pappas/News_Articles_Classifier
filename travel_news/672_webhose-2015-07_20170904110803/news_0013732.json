It is easy to cause deep offence, for example, by standing on the left-hand side of the down escalator at Holborn Underground station as many members of Britain’s dominant commuter tribe believe this area is sacred and occupied by the spirits of delayed office workers. You must obey the unwritten rules of the tube at all times (Alamy) Mountains often have special spiritual significance and we now know what trouble can be caused when thoughtless people lose their inhibitions and clothes on the summit of Mount Kinabalu, in Malaysia. • Tourist blunders: wrong place, wrong time • Queen's Guard push tourists out of the way Similarly, the British people regard Murray Mound, at Wimbledon , as a special place where they go to meditate and commune with an ancient god, Tim Henman. There is a strict rule of silence. Visitors picnicking on Henman Hill at Wimbledon (Heathcliff O'Malley) Coach tour visitors to Anne Hathaway’s cottage in Stratford upon Avon have been known to cause offence to the natives by trying to take away a straw of the thatch from the roof as a souvenir. • China to penalise badly behaved tourists • What if Eleanor Hawkins had flashed in St Paul's Cathedral? This cottage is a place of retreat for Anne Hathaway, the American film actress, when she wants a break from the hectic life of Hollywood, and many primitive fans of the film Love & Other Drugs regard her as a kind of goddess. Other actions likely to cause offence in Britain include taking selfies at Stonehenge (it drives the Druids bonkers) and young lovers attaching padlocks to the perimeter fence of the panda enclosure at London Zoo, as the pandas see this as taunting them about their love life. Revellers flock to Stonehenge (AP) An attempt to understand English history is always appreciated. Yeomen Warders at the Tower of London become distressed when visitors ask to be directed to the spot where Hilary Mantel was beheaded. • Fascinating early photos of London • Christina Odone: It's the old London that tourists want Tourists should also be warned to take great care when walking three abreast along the pavement with enormous packs on their backs. In all British cities, large backpacks are seen as the work of the devil.
