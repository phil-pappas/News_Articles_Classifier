The company was recently formed and plans to roll out several different types of travel accessories in 2015 and 2016, with the first being a men's RFID-blocking travel wallet .\nWhile there are other similar products already on the market, Travel Navigator is confident that their product will be at the top of the class, in part thanks to the information and data that can be gleaned from reviews of already existing travel wallets.\nMany travel wallets are currently for sale at Amazon.com, the worlds largest online retailer, and the best selling ones have a very large number of user reviews. Those reviews include both praise and criticism, and that user data is helping Travel Navigator to determine what consumers really want and value in a travel wallet.\nThere are several different types of travel wallets currently on the marketing, including those that can be worn inside a pocket like a traditional wallet, those that can be work around the neck, those that can be worn around the waist, and others that can be hidden on the lower leg. The variety of options is proving to be a valuable resource for determining what buyers really like and find to be useful.\nCharles Hynes of Travel Navigator says \"Amazon's review system is very helpful for customers because they can see what other people have said about the product, and those who regularly shop on Amazon put a lot of value into those reviews and ratings. That information is also very helpful to us as we try to determine the best features and functionality that should be included in our own product, and we can see the most common pain points that users are having with other similar products.\"\nTravel Navigator plans to release their travel wallet in July or August, 2015. More information about the company can be found at their website or at their Facebook page .\nAbout Travel Navigator\nTravel Navigator is a newly formed company that is developing a travel wallet for men to prevent pickpocketing and identity theft. The company is focused on providing safety and convenience-oriented travel accessories.\nContact\nCharles Hynes\n7174674679\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
