Our guide features expert recommendations for city , beach , villa , culture , food and drink and activity holidays. 1. Mont St Michel, Normandy The biggest news in Normandy for 2015 is the “Restoration of the Maritime Character” of Mont St Michel. The world-famous island abbey has not been a genuine island for many years; because the access road was never submerged, vast deposits of silt formed a permanent link with the mainland. Now a futuristic wooden-decked bridge allows the sea to swirl around the entire island, private vehicles are banned, and visitors can approach on foot, like medieval pilgrims, once again. Elsewhere, the city of Rouen, where Joan of Arc was condemned to death and burned at the stake in 1431, is unveiling a new interactive Joan of Arc History Centre, housed in the 15th-century archbishop’s palace where her trial took place.

Castles of the Languedoc To understand Languedoc, you need to know the Cathars. The 12th- and 13th-century dualist heretics were not only vital to regional history (they flourished in Languedoc as nowhere else) but still inform its identity. Every time they take on outsiders - whether at politics, rugby or simple bloody-mindedness - Languedociens invoke the spirit of their massacred forebears. In the hands of the history-tour specialists Andante, the learning process turns into a treat. Its seven-day, six-night trip swirls from Béziers - where 20,000 Cathars were slaughtered in the Pope’s 1208 crusade - to Toulouse, by way of vertiginous mountain-topping châteaux where Cathars holed up and, these days, only eagles dare. It’s a journey through landscapes as dramatic as their stories. From £2,325pp, including flights, local travel, hotels, all meals, expert lecturer, entries and tips (01722 713800; andantetravels.co.uk ). Anthony Peregrine 3. The Avignon fringe, Provence Oh yes - the Avignon fringe festival: now there’s a reason to travel. In normal times, Avignon comes pre-hallowed. The place hosted the 14th-century Popes. With the thumping great papal palace at its centre, the city was the hub of the world. It’s taken itself very seriously ever since, as the official Avignon festival indicates. The programme for what is Edinburgh-on-Rhône generally ways a ton. But, like Edinburgh , Avignon has its fringe (“le off,” they call it). And, with that, the dignified old spot explodes. Players invade all spaces, drumming up audiences for more than 1,100 shows in some 120 venues every day. Flyers announce “Godot est arrivé”. Music and dance enliven every corner. Theatre comes at you persistently, offering everything from Flemish absurdism through musicals, magic, jazz and slapstick to Shakespeare reviewed (“Romeo Hates Juliet”). Never was a city so invigorated. This year's \"Off\" is well underway (July 4-26); check the official website later in the year for 2016 dates. Kirker Holidays is a good option for a flight and accommodation package (020 7593 2283; kirkerholidays.com ). AP The fringe festival in Avignon 4. Matisse in Provence The Matisse Cut-Outs exhibition at Tate Modern was one of the great cultural hits of 2014. This exclusive Telegraph Tour will provide a powerful insight into this brilliant artist. Organised by Martin Randall Tours and led by Telegraph art critic and broadcaster, Alastair Sooke, it includes visits to the Chapel of the Rosary in Vence, which Matisse considered his masterpiece, and the Musée Matisse which unites a wide range of his ceramics, and paintings. There are also visits to the Picasso Museum in Antibes, the Maeght Foundation at St-Paul-de-Vence, and the Chagall Museum in Nice. From £1,720pp (single supplement £190), includes return flights, four-star hotel, three dinners, admissions and tips (0844 3715137; telegraph.co.uk/matissetour ). Dates: September 11-14, 2015. Nick Trend 5. Prehistoric rock art, Dordogne Prehistoric art in south-west France is extraordinary stuff, and you can rely on Martin Randall to put together a serious tour. Led by Britain’s top specialist in prehistoric art, the trip begins in Bordeaux . It swiftly moves to the extraordinary Lascaux cave in the Dordogne ’s Vézère Valley. The menagerie of wild bison, horses and ibex you see emblazoned on the rock is a copy – the Unesco World Heritage original is too precious. But the next two stops are the Real McCoy and deeply satisfying: exquisitely decorated Pech Merle in the Lot, and Niaux with its earth-shattering acoustics in the Pyrenees. There are simply no finer prehistoric caves in Europe. Martin Randall has a Cave Art of France tour , taking in these sites, from September 6-12, 2016. From £2,060pp, based on two sharing, including return flight, transfers, accommodation and most meals (contact details as above). Nicola Williams 6. Abbeys, churches and ruins of Burgundy Burgundy boasts some of the most majestic medieval buildings in Europe. The vast basilicas of Autun and Vezelay, the ruins of Cluny Abbey and the Gothic wonder of Dijon are just a few of the highlights. Farther north are the stunning Carolingian crypt in Auxerre with its ninth-century frescoes and the early Gothic cathedral of Sens. All can be visited without a guide, but you’ll get a better sense of the wealth and power of medieval Burgundy if you travel the region with an expert in tow. Martin Randall’s eight-day tour Medieval Burgundy: Abbeys and Churches of the High Middle Ages takes in all the key sites. From £2,520pp, including first-class Eurostar travel, TGV to Macon and four-star accommodation throughout. Departs June 4-11, 2016. Giles Milton Cluny Abbey (Photo: AP/Fotolia) 7. A brand new castle in Burgundy Burgundy’s hill-tops are dotted with castles, chateaux and medieval fortifications. But Guedelon Castle, in the north-west of the region, is different from the rest – building work started there in 1997. It sounds like a gimmick, but it’s not. Guedelon is a “medieval” castle that’s being built from scratch, using traditional tools and techniques. An army of masons, carpenters and rope-makers (along with many others) spend a part of each year here, constructing a castle in the same fashion as their medieval forebears. It’s fun and educational, a warts-and-all archaeological theme park and a must-see sight, especially if you’re travelling with children. Castle open from March to November, £9.50 adults, £8 children over five ( guedelon.fr ). GM 8. Strasbourg This year marks the 1,000th anniversary of Strasbourg’s great cathedral. Or at least the laying of the foundation stone. Only parts of the original scheme remain - the fabric was much adpated and rebuilt in the centuries afterwards - in fact, its 15th-century spire (only one of a planned two was completed) was the tallest building in the world from 1647 until 1974. It but it has some superb highlights, including wonderful stained glass from the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. And there is plenty more to see in Strasbourg (including a great fine arts museum, medeival streets and houses, and excellent regional wines and cuisine). Voyages SNCF (0844 848 5848; uk.voyages-sncf.com ) offers return rail fares from London via Paris from £118. NT Strasbourg (Photo: AP/Fotolia) 9. Agincourt and Waterloo A new, four-day tour called Journey through history: Waterloo to Agincourt starts with a walk along the Kent coastline and an exploration of Sir John Moore’s construction of more than 100 defensive martello towers. The itinerary from Saga (0800 096 0074; travel.saga.co.uk ) also takes in the battlefields of Waterloo and Agincourt with a focus on comparing the warfare tactics used in these conflicts, 400 years apart. The tour will also visit Mons, the 2015 European Capital of Culture and give time for sightseeing in Brussels. Departures until October 2015, from £499 including coach travel. NT 10. Somme Centenary Next year marks 100 years since the Battle of the Somme, during which more than 600,000 British and French troops lost their lives. Leger's five-day visit is timed to coincide with the anniversary and includes trips to all the key battlefields, museums and memorials. Those who are successful in a Government ballot will be able to attend a special ceremony on July 1 at Thiepval. The tour costs from £379 per person , including coach travel.
