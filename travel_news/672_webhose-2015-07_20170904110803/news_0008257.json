The conclusion may seem surprising: Bag fees have improved passenger satisfaction. \nThe studies in 2013 and 2015 by business and engineering professors from the University of Maryland and the University of Bergamo, Italy, said the bag fees cause passengers to check fewer bags, thus reducing lost-bag rates and cutting flight delays by reducing the time it takes to load bags onto planes. \nOne disadvantage of charging a checked-bag fee, according to the studies, is that passengers overstuff their carry-on bags to avoid the bag charges and, therefore, take longer to squeeze those bags into the overhead bins. \nStill, the overall time it takes to load and unload planes seems to be cut by having passengers check fewer bags, said Martin Dresner, one of the study's authors and a professor at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. \n\"Since there is less checked baggage, the turnaround time for aircraft can be reduced,\" he said. \nFor their part, Southwest Airlines officials say they have considered all of the advantages of charging bag fees — including the potential added revenue — but have no plans to end their \"bags fly free\" policy. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:43:12.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
