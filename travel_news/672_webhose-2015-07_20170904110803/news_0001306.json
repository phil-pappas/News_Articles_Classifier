The Eid Al Fitr festivities will begin on July 17 and DSS will roll out on July 23. \nTour operators and travel agents said they are in overdrive to meet the huge demand. \"Over 30 per cent of our inventory has been sold well in advance. The rest is being lapped up now,\" said Kulwant Singh, managing director of Lama Tours.\nHigh demand According to him, the demand for weekend stays has been particularly high this year. \"We are seeing brisk bookings for rooms in not just Dubai, but also Abu Dhabi, Yas, Ras Al Khaimah, Hatta and other places. The rates are averaging around Dh800 a night for two persons with transfers and some excursions.\"\nPremjit Bangara, general manager, Sharaf Travels, said: \"There is a huge upsurge in bookings from this region. Three-star hotel rates are starting at $175 while five-star hotels are commanding $400-$500 a night.\" \nHe said tourists from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries have traditionally been a strong market for the UAE during the festivities. \n\"The UAE has always been a favourite getaway. Youngsters head here for a mix of rest and relaxation while families love the shopping.\" \nShort haul destination \nSingh said: \"The UAE is a short haul destination and there are no visa requirements. Many of these visitors can just drive down without having to plan too much.\" \nFor those who wish to extend their stay, there's plenty to do. If the Eid Al Fitr celebrations with the much-awaited concerts and fireworks were not enough, Modhesh World, the biggest to date, has many themed adventure activities across eight halls of the Dubai World Trade Centre. This year's DSS also has many popular concerts lined up - from Diana Haddad and Nawal Kuwaitia to Hussain Al Jasmi and Kadim Al Sahir, besides cartoon shows, puppet theatre and mall events. The summer extravaganza's massive retail promotion will also offer Dh5.5 million worth of prizes. \nIn the capital, the Abu Dhabi Summer Season has also lined up a series of star-studded concerts, comedy shows, theatre, mall attractions, hotel promotions and shopping deals. \nÂ© Gulf News 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T08:15:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
