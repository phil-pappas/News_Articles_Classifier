We will see where the Kuoni tour operators can use our platforms. \n“But we can learn as well, for example from the Kuoni specialists and the travel agencies in Switzerland and the UK, which successfully sell high-value holidays.” \nHe also told the paper that any synergies following the acquisition would be achieved through operations and production. \n“Sales and brands are local and have to stay like that, we won’t force everything on to common platforms.” \nOnce the deal is complete DER Touristik will have bought about 40 different companies from Kuoni with combined revenues of about €2 billion and 1.5 million customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:46:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
