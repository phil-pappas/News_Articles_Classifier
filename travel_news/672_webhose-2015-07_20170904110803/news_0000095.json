We obtained them recently and they need ample time to recondition and de-stress themselves,” he told Bernama. \nTeoh said the fennec fox is a small nocturnal omnivorous mammal commonly found in the Sahara desert where it feeds on insects and rodents. \n“Visitors to our park will definitely adore this fox more for its unique physical features such as its big ears and small size that really makes it a cute animal,” he said. \nTeoh said the blue eared pheasant, meanwhile, is a rare and beautiful fowl originating from central China. \n“It is quite big and will definitely become another star at the park, especially for its colourful features,” he said. \nHe said other than the new attractions, the park's collections of crocodiles, Arapaima fish and a variety of bird species and other animals would continue to lure tourists. \nThe park, situated in Kampung Belanga Pecah, 13m from Langkawi's main town of Kuah, enjoys an average of 400 visitors daily during off-peak periods and about 700 on weekends and holidays. \n“Our park specialty is interaction between the visitors and the animals. Other parks may not allow visitors to feed their animals but we do and we even provide the proper food for the animals that our guests plan to feed,” Teoh said. ― Bernama  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T09:27:19.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
