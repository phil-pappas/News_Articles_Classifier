The results, garnered from more than 4,000 respondents, provided an interesting peek into the arena of food sports. \"This survey examined the behavior of our BBQ membership in terms of how they prepare to compete, how often they are competing and what type of investment in time, money and equipment they make to be part of the BBQ competition industry,\" said Carolyn Wells , KCBS executive director. Celebrating its 30 th year in 2016, KCBS is an international nonprofit society with more than 20,000 members worldwide. \"We now can speak confidently about what type of equipment and supplies our membership prefers to use and even where they prefer to buy it,\" Wells observed. \"The 21 percent response rate from our membership provides a statistical relevance not often found in surveys.\" Mike McCloud , whose firm, MMA Creative, is the agency of record for KCBS and helped design the survey for marketing insights, stated that the results provided concrete evidence on how similar \"food athletes\" are to \"traditional\" athletes. \"We've known for a very long time that food athletes come from two types of backgrounds - they are professionally trained chefs of some sort or they are people who grew up with a family/cultural tradition that celebrated the art form of creating and cooking food,\" said McCloud, who speaks regularly about food sport. \"Either way, they invest major amounts of time, money and energy in their quest to become an award-winning BBQ team or food champion.\"McCloud pointed out, for example, that there is a corresponding upswing in competitors who will travel for food sport and recent statistics that identify \"foodie groups\" with 1.3 million members holding meet-ups in 946 cities throughout the world. However, until the data was collected and analyzed from this most recent survey, it was difficult to drill into the psyche and behaviors of food athletes. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:12:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
