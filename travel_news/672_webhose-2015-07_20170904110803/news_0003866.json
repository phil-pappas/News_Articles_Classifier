It should not apply service tax to services rendered outside of India, including those for global distribution systems, extra baggage fees and international tickets. Also, the incoming GST regime should protect airlines from double taxation on income. \n\nNext, fuel needs to be priced competitively. As state taxes on jet fuel can be as high as 30 per cent, Tyler urged the government to grant “declared goods” status for jet fuel which would limit taxation. \n\nLastly, India should allow the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) to do its work independently. For example, India needs to overcome legal challenges that prevent AERA’s recommendation for a 78 per cent reduction in Delhi’s airport charges from being implemented. \n\nTyler also pointed out that Indian regulation is out-of-step with global standards and best practices, holding back the development of the sector. \n\nInstead, India needs “smarter regulation” that can address real issues, meet the public interest, be consistent with global standards and be implemented efficiently.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:50:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
