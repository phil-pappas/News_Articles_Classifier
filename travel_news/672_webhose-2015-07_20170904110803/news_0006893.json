Revenue improved to $942.0 million, up from $930.3 million last year. \nEarlier this year, WestJet said it would add the Boeing 767 to its fleet of aircraft, with an eye to using the larger passenger jets on some of its longer flights. \nThe new planes will feature an Economy Plus class, a cheaper alternative to business class that still gives travellers more room and extra amenities, WestJet said. \n\"We're taking advantage of what we're seeing in corporate Canada with corporate travel policies changing and companies not permitting their flyers on segments under five hours to buy business class fares,\" Saretsky said. \nThe quarterly results come as WestJet pilots are in the midst of a vote to decide if they'll form the airline's first union. The WestJet Professional Pilots Association is pushing to unionize the company's roughly 1,300 pilots, with voting until Aug. 5. \nSaretsky said he doesn't believe the company's relationship with its workforce will change, regardless of what happens. \n\"We've enjoyed very good labour relations with our employees over 19 years,\" he said. \"I don't expect that changes.\" \nThe WestJet Professional Flight Attendants Association also wants to have the airline's approximately 2,700 flight attendants unionized, but they are still working to have a majority of members sign up before a vote can be held. \nThe company also said Tuesday that it is rolling out a new in-flight entertainment system, offering TV shows, movies and wireless Internet access to passengers who download a company app on their personal smartphones or tablets. \nIn its quarterly report, capacity was up 7.5 per cent compared with a year ago, while revenue passenger miles were up 5.5 per cent. \nCost per available seat mile for the airline improved to 12.65 cents, down from 13.76 cents a year ago. But revenue per available seat mile slipped to 14.16 cents compared with 15.02 cents in the same quarter last year. \nSaretsky also said the company intends to complete its search for a chief financial officer by the end of the next quarter, with interim CFO Candice Li one of the candidates for the position.
