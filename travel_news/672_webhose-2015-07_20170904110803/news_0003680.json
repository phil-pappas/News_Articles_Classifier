PETERSBURG, Russia - Corinthia St. Petersburg announces record-breaking room revenue for June 2015, noting an impressive 5.7% increase on the hotel’s previous highest monthly room revenue, which was recorded in 2013. \nThe five-star hotel, located on the famous Nevsky Prospect, attributes this rise in bookings to a series of recently-implemented key strategies, which prioritize a strong focus on online marketing and cooperation with online travel agents (OTA’s), as well as broadening the countries from which guests originate. \nOnline Strategy \nCorinthia St. Petersburg’s online business continues to grow month on month, and will remain a key focal point in the hotel business, with an increase of 26% on 2014 and 65% on 2013.

The Russian market remains an important source of revenue for the hotel, which has huge appeal to those seeking grand-style accommodation in the heart of this famous city. The growth in revenue was also supported by the hotel’s efforts to integrate further into the local culture in St. Petersburg, by supporting the city’s sports and arts, including the FC Zenit, winners of the Russian Premier League. \nCorinthia St. Petersburg recorded an outstanding customer satisfaction score of 92.4%, an endorsement of Corinthia’s emphasis on the passionate and precise delivery of great service.
