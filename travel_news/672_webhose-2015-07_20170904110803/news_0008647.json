Construction will start next year and the terminal is expected to open in 2018. Carnival currently operates four ports around the world and will open Amber Cove in the northern Puerta Plata region of the Dominican Republic in October. NEW RACE IN NEW ZEALAND A new mountain bike race, the Pioneer , is set to hit the rugged trails of New Zealand’s Southern Alps in the Southern Hemisphere summer, between Jan. 31 through Feb. 6. The seven-day race will string together established bike trails with overland rides across farms and hillsides over 358 miles from Christchurch to Queenstown, with tent villages set up nightly for racers. Open to amateurs, the race requires each rider to pair up and cycle as a team of two. Capped at 1,000 riders, the race costs 2,499 New Zealand dollars per person or 4,998 dollars per team ($1,695 to $3,388, at 1.48 New Zealand dollars to the U.S. dollar) and includes nightly accommodation in tents and daily meals. Fitness is a prerequisite; all those mountain climbs account for over 55,000 feet in elevation gain. Prizes of up to 7,000 New Zealand dollars will be awarded for the fastest cumulative time for both members of a team. More symbolic daily awards include special jerseys for the leaders. ON NEW MEXICO’S CHILE TRAIL In time for New Mexico’s pepper harvest season, when its popular Hatch green chiles are picked and roasted, the town of Las Cruces has created a Walk of Flame , a guide to green chile foods. Also known as the Green Chile Trail, the online directory, created by the Las Cruces Convention & Visitors Bureau , identifies green chile dishes at area restaurants. Not limited to New Mexican fare, they include green chile lasagna, stew, chicken won tons, hummus, margaritas and even frozen custard. The guide also identifies a pick-your-own farm and the Chile Pepper Institute Garden at New Mexico State University, which is open for tours. Spice-obsessed visitors can book a special green chile package at Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces, which includes dinner for two and green chile cocktails, from $182 a night. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T01:00:43.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
