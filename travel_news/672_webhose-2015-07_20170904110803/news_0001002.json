Many of these brands are in limited distribution in Finland, so travellers will be able to take full advantage of their availability at Helsinki Airport.\n“We are extremely excited about the arrival of these six distinctive and celebrated brands. This proves that our extensive development work at the airport has paid off. We can now offer Finnish travellers prestige beauty products, many of which are still in very limited availability in the domestic market in Finland,” says Finavia’s Vice President Elena Stenholm, responsible for commercial operations at Helsinki Airport.\nMakeup lessons, hand massage and luxury cosmetics\nExpert Beauty Advisors and Makeup Artists will be on hand to deliver a wide range of premium services to customers including a complimentary five minute ‘Instant Pretty’ Makeup Lesson at Bobbi Brown, a relaxing Hand & Arm Massage at Jo Malone London and a walk-in make up demonstration and application by MAC’s highly skilled Makeup Artists.\nLa Mer’s ‘Arrive Hydrated’ skin care regimen will offer customers specific La Mer products for use pre-boarding, as well as for a pampering pick-me-up during flights. Tom Ford Beauty is a covetable collection of luxurious cosmetics and fragrances infused with the utmost quality and craftsmanship.\nOrigins brings a sense of wonder, wisdom and well-being to the way beauty is experienced. The new counter encourages consumers to discover the brand’s high-performance natural solutions such as the hydrating Drink Up Intensive Mask for pre-flight skincare preparation.\nThe new beauty area will offer the latest innovations in skincare and cosmetics to global travellers looking to treat themselves or discover the perfect gift for someone special.\nService overhaul at its final stage\nFinavia’s refurbishment of its retail space at Helsinki Airport is in its final stages. Passengers can now experience and enjoy some 70 new or renovated shops and restaurants.\nThe final renovations in Terminal 2 will be completed by the end of 2015. After this, further upgrades will take place in Terminal 1.\nAt the same time, Finavia is carrying out an extensive development programme, enabling it to increase the transit capacity at the airport and prepare to serve approximately 20 million passengers annually by 2020.\nRelated Posts Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
