Gina Chiappazzi of Limaland Comedy tells The Lima News ( http://bit.ly/1NYxhCK ) that the comedian who died in 2012 is an inspiration to women because she was one of the first to break into the male-dominated profession. \nAllen County Museum director Patricia Smith says she would love to see a more elaborate Diller display at the museum. \nThe museum's few Diller items include a dress, two paintings done by Diller and some publicity photos. \nInformation from: The Lima News, http://www.limanews.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T02:56:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
