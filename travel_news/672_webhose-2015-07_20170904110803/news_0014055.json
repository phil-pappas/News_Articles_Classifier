The all-in-one application, which helps passengers create convenient airport journeys with a wide array of airport-related information, is now available for the public to download.\nFeaturing a new, user-friendlier interface, the application gives airport users access to a much wider scope of information. In addition to flight searches, users can access passenger guides, schedules for cross-border ferries and coaches, transport guides to and from HKIA, shopping and dining options, an updated map of various airport facilities, as well as the weather information of their destinations. In addition, users can be linked to airlines’ online check-in platforms easily via this application. They will also continue to receive “push” notifications of latest updates of saved flights and special airport service announcements.\nVivian Cheung, Deputy Director, Airport Operations of Airport Authority Hong Kong, said, “‘HKG My Flight’ aims to provide passengers with convenient access to real-time flight schedules and status updates, as well as instant notifications of special airport announcements. We enhanced the application by improving both the user interface and content, and we hope the newly added features will further improve users’ airport experiences – offering comprehensive and customer-centric information about the variety of facilities and services available at HKIA.”\nSince its launch in March 2013, “HKG My Flight” has been downloaded more than 330,000 times. The application has won Gold Awards for two consecutive years in the Web Accessibility Recognition Scheme organised by the Government Chief Information Officer and the Equal Opportunities Commission, and was also named one of the three most popular mobile applications in the public voting section.\nSource:- HKIA\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
