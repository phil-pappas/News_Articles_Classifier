This trip was six months in the making, and we used a lot of resources to make it happen. One of the most important was the travel section of About.com .\nAbout.com has thousands of experts on everything from Frugal Living to Grammar and Composition , and everything in between. But it’s the Travel section that has become my personal addiction — and not just because I’m the Air Travel Expert .\nBefore going to either city, you want to get the absolute best air fare. Start with my post, Mine Pinterest Boards To Find The Best Airfare Deals​ . Another helpful post is Websites Offer Tips For Finding Best Air Fares .\nWhen it comes to Paris and London, there are so many things to see and do, but only so much time to do them in. I did a Google search on tourist attractions in Paris and the About.com page for expert Courtney Traub popped up with this great post: What To See In Paris, Neighborhood by Neighborhood , which served as a great jumping-off point for our family. And because I like a good bargain and like to save my pennies, Courtney's Visiting Paris on a Budget .\nI knew I wanted to take the kid to one of the myriad Christmas markets that pop up across the city for the holiday season, and Courtney had that covered here . We needed a guide of restaurants that were open for dinner on Christmas since Paris tends to shut down that day. Again, it was Courtney to the rescue, here . She also had a general guide about spending Christmas in the City of Lights, here .\nAnd finally, we got great tips for our Christmas Day excursion to Disneyland Paris here .\nSo when it came time to plan for the London part of the trip, I went directly to About.com expert Laura Porter . First up, because I was on a budget, I went to Laura's post 100+ Free Things to Do in London . I wanted my daughter to experience a proper English high tea, but I needed one more oriented to kids. Laura covered that in her post, Afternoon Tea in London with Kids . I found a nice list of things to do for free with kids in London, here . I didn’t get a chance to see a theater show while I was there, but Laura did a great article here on how to score cheap tickets.\nYou may not want to travel during the Christmas holidays, so both Courtney and Laura offer great tips no matter when you want to go. Here are some articles on traveling to London and Paris during different seasons:\nPlanning Your Trip To London One Week in London\nExpert Tips: When is the Best Time of Year to Visit Paris?\nParis by Month: Weather, Packing Guides, and Events Calendars\nIt's never too early to start planning for a trip to Europe. But I have to warn you that the site can be addictive, and you can spend hours checking on all the experts’ great advice , no matter where you want to go.\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/v/M/eiffel-tower-388553_1280.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/v/M/eiffel-tower-388553_1280.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:42:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
