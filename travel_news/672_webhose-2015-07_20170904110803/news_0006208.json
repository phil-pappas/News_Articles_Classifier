Saeed Sarhan. \nFire emergencies have been on the rise in Makkah recently, with this being the third isolated event in the last week. Earlier, a forklift in the Masaa caught fire as a result of a short-circuit and injured three; it was followed by a fire break out in an upholstery and sofa sets workshop in Sharayea Al-Mujahideen, killing four and injuring three. \nA spokesperson for Hilton told Hotelier Middle East : \"We can confirm At 03:00 am on July 11 there was a fire in one of the fast food restaurants on the second floor of the commercial center. Due to the smoke created by the fire, the civil defense authorities evacuated the commercial center. The situation was back to normal at 04:15 am and visitors were allowed to revisit the commercial center.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:25:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
