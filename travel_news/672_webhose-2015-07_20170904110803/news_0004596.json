It includes a grand staircase in the lobby, murals, classic motifs and chandeliers. The Gardens include water features, a fountain and a helipad. \n“It epitomises timeless elegances while incorporating regional inspiration to differentiate itself from other hotels,” the Group’s chairman Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor said in a statement. \n“As soon as you enter the gardens you feel like you have stepped into another world from a bygone era. The architecture of the façade is dominated by Roman-style columns, like the ones you would see at the Colosseum.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T14:11:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
