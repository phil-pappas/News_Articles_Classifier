From what I saw, for those receiving their degrees, it is even more so.The pomp, the ceremony, gowns and caps, a packed room of 700 people loudly applauding every student as they walked across the stage to collect their degree from the vice-principal, all added up to be a powerful reminder of what each had achieved over the last three or four years.While my educational failings (for which I take full responsibility!) left me falling way short of a university appearance and subsequent graduation, I have been lucky enough to experience a similar incredible high via our business Holidaysplease, which has won major industry and supplier awards.There will be few of us that put winning an award top of our “why we go to work list”, yet when it comes your way, the recognition really does hit home and acts as a huge motivator to keep pushing yourself forward.Which is why awards for our team are an integral part of the Holidaysplease culture.First and foremost, Holidaysplease homeworkers want to make sales to earn money. Many of them took the decision to become homeworkers to give themselves the opportunity to achieve a higher reward for the work they put in. And when they achieve this they are happy.Yet, generating yearly sales that see them recognised and celebrated at our annual Holidaysplease Awards Night often becomes more of a driving force to a good deal of them. Taking home a certificate to stick on an office wall can mean an incredible amount. \n“When it comes your way, the recognition really does hit home and acts as a huge motivator to keep pushing yourself forward” \nHowever small or large your business, and no matter what size of team you manage, if you are not currently finding ways to celebrate and recognise your staff, start doing so. You will find the effort to be extremely worthwhile.Not everyone can be a winner of course. Acting as a TTG Travel Awards judge meant making difficult decisions between nominated travel companies. I can tell you that the panel I sat on had some fantastic businesses doing amazing things.The winners will be deserving of their moment of glory in front of industry peers on September 28. And I’m sure those nominated that don’t take home a highly prized TTG Trophy will go away inspired to continue to innovate and improve with a real determination to come back in 2016 with an even more compelling case for victory!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T13:03:38.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
