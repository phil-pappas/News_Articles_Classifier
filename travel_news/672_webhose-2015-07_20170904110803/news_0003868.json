Tomic said he felt he’d been harshly done by throughout the ordeal.\nThe tennis player told Amor he had been asleep when security guards initially knocked on his door in response to noise complaints aimed at his hotel suite.\nPolice outside the W Hotel in South Beach, Miami where Bernard Tomic was arrested after telling officers to ‘relax' over noise complaints.

After that, police arrived to request the Australian leave the hotel.\nFrom this point onwards, Amor said Tomic gave an impression that he had been hard done by in his dealings with police, after he began collecting his belongings in a fashion that was “not quick enough”.\nWhen hurried along by Miami officers, Tomic allegedly told police to “relax”, after which he was placed in handcuffs and forcibly removed from the hotel.\nTomic has found himself in a long-running negative spotlight of late after disputes with Tennis Australia combine with off court drama.

I’m sorry for the police and the disturbance I caused.\n“I’m just happy I got out, and no one got hurt.”\nTomic also told Amor he would “not be apologising to Tennis Australia” about his comments, claiming he had received no support from the sport’s national body in recent times.\nOriginally published as Bernard Tomic tells police to ‘relax’", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/454758-c4ba1a7a-2c15-11e5-a754-a63f13c4fffa.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/sports-life/bernard-tomic-reveals-his-version-of-events-after-miami-arrest/story-fno61i58-1227445458001", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/454704-b98603fe-2c05-11e5-ad8b-48e697b195ed.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-17T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:18:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
