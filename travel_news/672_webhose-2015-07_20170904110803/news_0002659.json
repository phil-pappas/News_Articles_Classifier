(Dixie D. Vereen/For The Washington Post) When Curtis Stone’s son, Hudson, was born three years ago, the chef faced the same dilemma so many other enthusiastic cooks do when they become parents. “It can quickly become a chore,” he told me in an interview recently, “and what you used to love is suddenly replaced by, ‘Oh, my God, I’ve got to get that done within the next 12 1 / 2 minutes?”\nStone knows the crisis point well. And he knows which way he wants parents to go. “You either embrace cooking and say, ‘Well, it’s just got to be a part of our life, and we’ll make it as fun and interesting as we can,’ or you go in the other direction, which a lot of people do, and say, ‘Okay, we start getting a lot more takeout,’ which is unfortunate.”\nJoe Yonan is the Food and Dining editor of The Washington Post and the author of \"Eat Your Vegetables: Bold Recipes for the Single Cook.\" He writes the Food section's Weeknight Vegetarian column.

With his broad smile and Australian accent, the Melbourne-born chef and culinary-competition-show host is particularly well suited for the job. His new book, “ Good Food, Good Life ,” preaches the cook-yourself-happy gospel, too.\nStone isn’t vegetarian, nor is the book, but there are plenty of plant-centric recipes scattered throughout it, most of them in the chapters for “light meals” and sides. And many of the recipes take inspiration from his California garden — not only as a source of fresh, seasonal produce, but also as a way to make sure Hudson doesn’t grow up with dreaded picky-eater syndrome.\n“I quickly learned how important it was to show a young guy, new to the world, where his food comes from,” he said. “It’s lots of fun watching him learn what nature does. You plant something, and then you have to care for it, and then eventually, you get the chance to pull that carrot out of the ground. It’s just ridiculously exciting to him. Then you bring it inside, and you turn it into something.”\nI don’t have kids, so I haven’t reached the cooking crisis that Stone describes. For me, it’s still a joy, even at the end of a long workday — in no small part thanks to the pleasure I get from using my own garden’s produce. But especially as the summer heats up, we’re all looking for anything that can remind us what big payoffs (including joy) can result from the smallest efforts in the kitchen.\nFor parents, I offer one particular recipe in Stone’s book that caught my eye. Its filling is little more than sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado and red onion, layered in flatbreads that have been slathered with a brilliantly simple combination of feta and Greek yogurt. The chef’s smart touch: torn mint leaves and lemon zest and juice.\nI can imagine all sorts of ways young hands would enjoy getting involved in the ingredient-growing, preparation and/or consumption of this sandwich. But I can tell you from experience that grown-ups will love making — and devouring — it, too.\nRecipes :\nVeggie Flatbread Sandwiches With Feta-Yogurt Spread\nMore from Food :\nThe front-yard garden gets squared away\nWhy you should use cashew cream, even if you’re not vegan", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/joeyonan", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034554255X", "https://twitter.com/@JoeYonan", "https://plus.google.com/112656314744026336164/"], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:31:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
