The DOJ investigation is coming at a critical time for consumers. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal’s (D-CT) recent leadership on this problem is welcomed, and the European Commission should join in on this investigation. There is precedent for this investigation per previous U.S. Federal Trade Commission investigations and rulings with respect to tacit competitor coordination – especially on analyst calls. \n\n\n“The number one concern that antitrust experts have – with no close second – as with regard to radical consolidation of any industry, is the risk of tacit competitor coordination on policies, practices and prices among a reduced number of industry participants,” stated BTC chairman Kevin Mitchell. “Since recent U.S. airline mega-mergers, we have witnessed near constant airline CEO calls for ‘capacity discipline’ during industry gatherings and analyst earnings calls only to be echoed by analysts in follow-on earning calls with other airlines. This represents perhaps the darkest hours of airline coordination as well as a too-cozy harmonization between airlines and Wall Street,” added Mitchell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T09:31:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
