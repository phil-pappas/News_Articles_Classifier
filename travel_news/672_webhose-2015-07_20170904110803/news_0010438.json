I love her pastel hues in her photography. She is always somewhere exciting and her photographs will take you away to a far off place. Plus, she’s a great lady, she’s always been so supportive of us. YoungAdventuress \nWe first took notice of Liz while in Queensland Australia. We were doing the same campaign #Room753. However, we never saw each other. She was doing adventures in one spot and we were doing them in another. But we kept up to date on her travels through Queensland through here Instagram photography and we’ve never stopped following. She’s now New Zealand’s premier Instagram photographer and she is always showcasing exciting photographs and adventures to her followers. LaurenepBath \nWhat can we say about Lauren. She’s the world’s most famous Instagram Travel Photographer and has amassed a huge following. We’ve met her now in both Canada and Australia and she’s as fun in real life as she is at taking amazing photographs. She is constantly crisscrossing the globe sharing a diverse range of photographs. Chrysti \nWe just met Chrysti in South Dakota and had an amazing time with this gal. She was one of the first travel photographers on Instagram and has been going strong ever since. If you are wondering why you haven’t heard of her yet, well, health issues forced her to take a year off but she is coming back with gusto and showcasing her beautiful iPhone photography to the world. The Blonde Abroad \nI really enjoy Kiersten’s Instagram feed. She mixes fashion with travel in the most exotic locations. Plus she’s gorgeous. (I can say that, I’m a lady) Her photos always put a smile on my face as she really showcases what it is like to love life and live it to the fullest. I’m always transported somewhere to paradise. Legal Nomads \nWhat I love about Jodi’s account is how diverse it is. She isn’t afraid to post something out of the ordinary. LegalNomads main focus is food travel, but her photographs show the fun and excitement that travel brings. When you follow LegalNomads you are treated to a window into Jodi’s very exciting life! Jewelszee \nWe discovered Jewelszee when we discovered the other amazing Australian Instagram travel photographers. We have yet to meet her in person, but she already feels like a friend. She is supportive and generous. We are small potatoes compared to her, but she regularly visits our account to say hello and give our photographs a like. Like many of the other women in this list, her photographs are diverse displaying a range of photography skills. StephBeTravel \nI love Steph Be’s Intagram photography feed. She’s a master at citysapes, but then as you scroll through her photographs, you see that she’s a master at everything. I love her beach shots, fun people shots, selfies and landscapes. It is a feed that makes you want to travel. AdventurousKate \nKate is a power player in the travel blogging world and is going strong on Instagram too! She is constantly travelling and her feed really shows off the places that she visits. I love the blend of photographs that she shares. It’s a mix of landscape, cities, food, portraits and art. It’s so much fun to follow along and see what Kate is up to each day. A Lady in London \nDon’t let the name fool you. A Lady in London has been to more than 100 countries! Her colourful photographs create a mosaic of sunsets, flowers and luxury living. Named top Instagram in travel by the likes of Esquire & Harper’s Bazaar she also posts for one of our other favourite Instagram Travel Accounts, BBC_Travel. Inside Travel Lab \nInside the Travel Lab was the very first person we followed in Instagram. Abi has a real eclectic stream of Instagram photographs and I love it! She’s always finding the interesting perspectives and angles and captures exactly what she feels like. There isn’t an agenda in her photographs, it’s a stream of her varied and fun travels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:25:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
