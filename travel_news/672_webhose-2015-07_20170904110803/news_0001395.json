Jarry’s bizarre take on Shakespeare’s tragedies provoked outrage when it premiered in Paris in 1896. However, it is now regarded as one of the most important theatrical works of the fin de siècle. Director Declan Donnellan updates the action to modern-day Paris where Ubu is the son of bourgeois parents who cuts through their respectability with his violent and surreal fantasies. The production reunites Donnellan with designer Nick Ormerod. Both worked on the critically acclaimed version of Boris Gudonov in 2009. You can watch the live streaming here at 7pm on Sunday, July 26, 2015. @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T22:49:28.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
