Elderly men and women puff on hand-rolled cigars almost as large as the 1950 hood ornaments on the Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Chevrolets that line cobblestoned streets. Silhouetted young couples hold each other along the Malecón seawall at sunset. Three-storey Spanish colonial dwellings with wrought iron detail and open courtyards crumble elegantly. Stencils of the charismatic revolutionary Che Guevara are sprayed on walls around town.\nBut it is the music that draws you in to this intriguing city and holds you there – seguing from one song to another, one rhythm to the next – creating an atmosphere that’s equal parts exotic, exuberant and enduring. Above the chatter, bicycle bells and clattering engines, joyous Latin melodies and voices combine with Afro rhythms in the form of son montuno, guaracha, chachachá and mambo, and flow from every open window and doorway.\nThe city – and in particular Habana Vieja (Old Havana) – feels like an enormous backlot of a fading film studio or a page from a Tintin book come to life.\nThere are no gaudy takeaway chains or advertising hoardings. No speeding cars or bustling commuters. Tricycle taxis are also as common in Havana as common as posters of Fidel Castro. Picture: John Barker Source: Supplied\nAll the while the music provides an ever-present soundtrack – percussive, propulsive and infectious.\nSince Fidel Castro overthrew the US-backed government of President Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959, little has changed. Commercial, economic and financial embargos imposed by the US the following year, and extended significantly in 1962, ensured that growth and development came to a standstill.\nNow, with relationships thawing between the US and Cuba – following the restoration of diplomatic relationships between the two countries this week – change will be inevitable.\nLast year alone tourism increased by 14 per cent and travel agencies across the globe are claiming that now is the time to see Cuba; escape.com.au rated Cuba as a Top Destination for 2015. Later this year ferries will make the once popular journey from Florida to Havana Harbour for the first time since 1963.\nNot everyone is embracing the change.\n“We’re not interested in McDonald’s and Starbucks,” says a former doctor (who asked not to be named) as we sit together on a park bench overlooking Cuba’s second-largest city, Santiago de Cuba. American cars from the 1950s also double as taxis while horse and carts are common form of transport for farmers in Cuba. Picture: John Barker Source: Supplied\n“Nothing is going to change in a hurry because we don’t want our culture to change. We don’t have everything the West might have but what we have, we cherish.”\nOthers are more open to the prospects.\n“There are too few jobs and no money,” Havana taxi driver Fernando says. “Things have to change but we have to have control.”\nFor now though Havana remains the antithesis of the modern metropolis.\nWhile other modern cities sanitise and homogenise, losing their individuality and character, Havana and other destinations along our route remain brash, defiant and confident. They bristle with a tangible humanity. People hang in windows and doorways, shout over balconies and across gleaming car bonnets, and engage with neighbours and in the world of the street.\nA PHOTO JOURNEY THROUGH HAVANA\nThey may live with frustrating bureaucracy, limited Wi-Fi, queues at the bank, empty shelves in shops and yet Cubans have fought, suffered and ultimately triumphed against embargos from a superpower 150km to the north.\nThey don’t sweat the small stuff. But they do get hot and sweaty when the music kicks in and the beat goes on.\nOn a balmy Wednesday afternoon in Havana, we stroll in to the tiny La Bodeguita del Medio bar.\n“My mojito in the Bodeguita del Medio. My daiquiri in the Floridita,” is scrawled in Ernest Hemingway’s handwriting on the wall adjacent the bar. Here we find a five-piece band playing Benny Moré’s A La Bahia de Manzanillo to a total of seven customers. The sun shines through the open windows as one customer sings along with more gusto than the singer in the band and two women sway in tandem to the infectious Latin groove. It’s the joy of music – not the mojitos – that fuels their enthusiasm. Smoking a hand-rolled cigar in Trinidad, Cuba. Picture: John Barker Source: Supplied\nSimilar scenes of exuberant revelry are repeated again and again as we travel east from Havana across the country, from small bars to dance clubs; from roadside restaurants to rooftop gatherings.\nFrom Havana we drive four hours to Trinidad on a near empty A1 four-lane highway, past horse-drawn carts and travellers holding out cash in hope of a lift. After a couple of hours we pass the turn-off to the town of Australia where Fidel Castro bunkered down in a sugar factory and orchestrated his country’s response to the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961.\nHistory and politics are an intrinsic part of the fabric of Cuba. Inhabited by Mesoamerican tribes before its discovery by Christopher Columbus in 1492, the island’s past reads like the pages of a Horrible Histories , littered with conquistadors, slaves, pirates, rum, rebellion and revolution.\nMore modern times are represented in the figures of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and national hero José Martí who appear scattered on billboards in fields, on walls of buildings and as statues in town squares rejoicing in their country’s ongoing independence.\nArriving in Trinidad, three local musicians kick off proceedings on a Caribbean beach with the Escambray mountains as our backdrop. A bonfire blazes as they effortlessly play Cuban classics such as El Carretero , Chan Chan and … Hotel California (albeit more in the style of the Gipsy Kings than The Eagles), ensuring that before long we end up dancing in the headlights of the minibus that has delivered us to the stunning location.

It is appropriate that our final destination is the birthplace of so much of Cuba’s music. We listen to the percussive beat of congas from a rooftop across the way, while a salsa class sashays on a rooftop down the road. The sound of rumba rumbles on a radio from a shop below and the music appears to fill the air around us. It is a wonderful and uniquely Cuban experience.\nMusician Ry Cooder observed that “in Cuba the music flows like a river” and sitting on the rooftop, surrounded by the beguiling rhythms of Latin America, one has to agree.\nSo, is now a good time to visit Cuba? Change is imminent but to what extent and when, it’s impossible to say.\nFor now, as long as the music flows – through the prominent genres of son, salsa cubana, rumba, bolero, nueva trova and timba – it will always be a good time to visit Cuba.\n Blue car in front of the Capitol Building.

Here’s a sampler of some of the most memorable.\nFILM\nI Am Cuba (Spanish: Soy Cuba) is a 1964 Soviet-Cuban film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov. The film was almost completely forgotten until it was rediscovered by filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese. Worth the price of entry alone for the gravity-defying tracking shot high above the streets of Havana. See youtube.com/watch?v=sYFXv6bDIY8\nMUSIC\nWhere do you start to choose music from such a vast catalogue? With Buena Vista Music Club, the record and film that shone a light on Cuban music and became a worldwide sensation with the album selling more than five million copies and the Wim Wenders film nominated for an Academy Award. A sequel to the movie is in production. See youtube.com/watch?v=UXwLBS3yUkA\nDANCE\nBallet de Camagüey is second only to the Havana company in terms of prestige but their performances are magnetic. When not touring internationally, the company performs at the Teatro Principal, located at Padre Valencia, two blocks north east of Plaza de los Trabajadores. See youtube.com/watch?v=T-NvT4TE67g\nLITERATURE\nHavana-born journalist, essayist, screenwriter and novelist Leonardo Padura Fuentes is the most widely known Cuban author outside the Caribbean isle. He’s best known for his quartet of detective novels featuring lieutenant Mario Conde, a cop who would rather be a writer and admits to feelings of “solidarity with writers, crazy people and drunkards”. See youtube.com/watch?v=6nfU_Y6ewqU\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHusband and wife photographers Alex Webb and Rebecca Norris Webb capture the mystery and colour of Cuba in their book of extraordinary photos, Violet Isle . “As we photographed in Cuba, we began to realise that our work sprang from the feel of a nation in a kind of bubble — an economic, political, cultural, and ecological bubble.” See webbnorriswebb.co\nThe writer travelled with Intrepid Travel.\nGO2\nCUBA\nGETTING THERE\nCurrently the best way for Australians to get to Cuba is via either Canada or Mexico. A one-way fare from Mexico City to Havana with the national carrier Cubana costs about AUD $200-250. See cubana.cu\nTOURING THERE\nIntrepid Travel offers a nine-day Cuba Music & Dance tour. See intrepidtravel.com\nSTAYING THERE\nAirbnb prices in Havana start at AUD $13 a night.\nHostal Lola (a casa particular homestay) in Trinidad has rooms for about AUD $30 a night.\nMORE\nPaperwork: You can obtain a tourist visa to enter Cuba from the Cuban Embassy in Canberra or from any airport that has routes to Havana (Mexico City, Cancun, Toronto, Gatwick and many South American airports). The visa allows you to stay 30 days in Cuba and can be extended for another 30 days from within Cuba.\nMoney: Cuba has two currencies — the Cuban Peso and the Cuban Convertible Peso. Cubans mainly use Cuban Pesos. Foreign visitors should use the Convertible Peso and the conversion rate is about 1.2 Australian dollars per peso. The Cuban Government charges a tax of about 10 per cent for converting foreign currencies into Convertible Peso. The best cash currency to bring to Cuba is euros.\nATMs: It is best to take foreign cash into Cuba to convert into pesos as ATMs are few and hard to find. The ATMs in Cuba work for most Visa cards, but not for Mastercards. ATMs in Havana can only be found at major hotels and Havana airport.\nInternet: Very few hotels outside Havana have Wi-Fi but most hotels have computers that you can use to access the internet, albeit at dial-up speed and high costs.\nMobile phones: Most Australian mobile phone companies don’t have roaming agreements in Cuba. You’re better off getting an international SIM card but check the charges for calls and texts in Cuba because they are still quite expensive.", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/585589-d86e40da-2c62-11e5-a754-a63f13c4fffa.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-NvT4TE67g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYFXv6bDIY8", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/585509-05df4ad4-2c2a-11e5-aa8f-85f55b955825.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/584665-484f5fee-2c2a-11e5-aa8f-85f55b955825.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/584719-3f4b73fc-2c24-11e5-aa8f-85f55b955825.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nfU_Y6ewqU", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/584771-6aab9c42-2f4a-11e5-8b6b-ddbc289c2b0a.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXwLBS3yUkA"], "published": "2015-07-26T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:33:13.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
