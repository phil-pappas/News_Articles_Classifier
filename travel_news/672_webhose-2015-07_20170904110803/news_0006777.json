(AP) -- The National Park Service says a new visitor center at the Flight 93 National Memorial in western Pennsylvania will open Sept. 10. Site superintendent Steve Clark says the visitor center will feature photographs, artifacts, models, audio and video to tell a \"fuller story about the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew of United Flight 93.\" Flight 93 was hijacked during the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The passengers fought back and the plane crashed near Shanksville, killing all aboard. Also opening are an education center, a multipurpose gathering space, pedestrian trails and a walkway tracing the flight path. The park service says it expects the expanded memorial site to attract heavy crowds. It plans to distribute free, timed tickets. --- This story has been corrected from an earlier version to show that 9/11 occurred in 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T08:48:54.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
