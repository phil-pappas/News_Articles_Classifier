And this year, for the first time, visitors are able to experience the harvest with them.\nA new eco-tour allows travelers to watch the cork harvest and later follow donkeys carrying towering loads to one of the traditional pueblos blancos, towns whose buildings are painted stark white and which dot the countryside in Catalonia , Andalusia and Extremadura .\nThe tour, From Bark to Bottle, leads participants on an 11-day trip through Spain’s cork trail to discover the lives of the harvesters, the forest’s biodiversity and the cultural and gastronomic heritage of the area — in essence, the cork’s path from tree to wine. Cork is a renewable resource; every year farmers go to a different part of their land to harvest, only returning to the same trees every nine years.\nPhoto One of the traditional “white villages” that dot the countryside amid cork forests.

Farmers there, in the heart of the cork forest, remove bark from the same trees used by their great-grandfathers. The intricate process takes only a few cuts before the harvesters peel the bark away like a sharpening pencil.\nIn the expansive savannas there, visitors spend four days watching the harvest, eating lunch with farmers and trying their hand at slicing jamón, the salty slab of cured pork that Spain is famous for, on a farm where pigs are raised eating cork oak acorns. Nights are spent in either a high-end hotel tucked in to a refurbished medieval building or an agritourismo, a country estate nestled among cork trees.\nPhoto A cork-carrying donkey in Andalusia.

The focus shifts to food, with visits to artisanal cheese, wine and olive oil producers. The evening can be spent attending group dinners while watching burros carry loads of cork bark into town as the sun goes down. Two vans are available to participants, so early-risers have a chance to head back to the hotel, while others can enjoy a late evening out.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The trip ends in Catalonia, in the mossy and forested northeast, with a visit to a 405-acre privately owned cork forest near the region’s rocky coastline, a sensory experience at the Cork Institute, a cork factory excursion, a small-production cava-maker tour, and a chance to eat fish bought that same morning at a fish auction.\nStops include tiny towns the typical tourist doesn’t see, like ninth-century Ronda , the historic trading center with cobblestone roads and ancient churches that is modern bullfighting’s birthplace. Imagine a city divided by a deep canyon, traversed by an arched bridge reminiscent of a Roman aqueduct.\nCork bark is closely intertwined with the lives of the people in these regions.\n“When you go to a little village of 600 people, it doesn’t matter whether you’re a cobbler or you sell cheese or you run a laundromat or you pump gas,” Mr. Spencer said. “All of the money that’s coming into your village is coming from cork, so everyone is invested. There’s an intimacy between the people of the cork forest and their trees.”", "external_links": ["http://www.corkforest.org/barktobottle/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS2/12HEADS2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS1/12HEADS1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS1/12HEADS1-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS3/12HEADS3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS2/12HEADS2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/alcornocales.htm", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/travel/12HEADS3/12HEADS3-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:32:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
