Offering luxury-tour-operating and destination-management services to guests traveling in Chile, the company’s office in Santiago opened on the 15th. By mid-August, trips to Argentina will launch. And by 2016, guests will be able to book Peru and Ecuador experiences. \nThe new, 11-night Best of Chile itinerary (from $11,850 for minimum of two guests) comprises a city experience in Santiago bookended by outdoor adventures, which start with a hike through Mars-like terrain in the driest place on Earth, the Atacama Desert, and end with scaling blue glaciers in Patagonia. Highlights include flamingo watching on salt flats and an early morning drive to watch natural geysers spew water hundreds of feet into the air. Clients travel with a private vehicle and guide, and can extend their trip to see Easter Island’s ancient moai statues. \nOn a 12-night Best of Argentina tour (from about $13,300 for minimum of two guests), travellers will learn tango in Buenos Aires, speedboat up to Iguazu Falls, and experience guacho culture on a working estancia . A seven-night, wine-tasting extravaganza takes guests into both countries for private visits to boutique wineries in Chile’s Colchagua and Maipo valleys and Argentina’s Mendoza region.
