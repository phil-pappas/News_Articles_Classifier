They should weigh 8oz/225g. If not, use the fifth egg. Beat the butter and sugar together in a mixer until pale and creamy. Add the eggs a spoonful at a time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the lemon zest and vanilla extract. Fold in the flour with a large metal spoon. Divide the mixture between two 8in/20cm cake tins, lined with baking parchment and bake for 15-20 minutes, until well risen and springy to touch. Use a cocktail stick to check it’s cooked. Leave in the tins for five minutes, then turn out on to a rack to cool. Whip the cream softly (it should be the texture of natural yoghurt). Spread two thirds on the lower layer of the cake. Mash half the raspberries with the jam and spread on the bottom of the upper layer. Sandwich together. Spread the rest of the cream on top. Add raspberries, and white chocolate drops if using. Dust with icing sugar.
