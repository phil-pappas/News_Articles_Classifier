A salute to tradition Manathai Hotels & Resorts embraces Thai heritage with the launch of a luxury boutique resort in Koh Samui . Located opposite a fishing village on Lamai Beach, the 148-room colonial-period styled beachfront resort sets itself apart by the lengths to which it has gone to remain authentic to the cultural nuances of the destination utilising indigenous materials and methods as foundations to shape the guest experience. Examples can be found throughout the resort, from the ancient Dok Phi Khun floral patterns exhibited in the coloured glass panels in rooms and restaurant areas to the use of Bai Jak, the leaf from the native Nypa Palm, which the resort uses to provide complimentary hand fans to guests.
