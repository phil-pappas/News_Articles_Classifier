The 52-year-old entrepreneur was found impaled on railings beneath his fourth-floor apartment in Marylebone, central London last December. But Michelle Young, who was locked in a bitter divorce battle with him when he died, has insisted the father of two would not have taken his own life, suggesting his murky business dealings need to be fully explored. Mrs Young said whatever the outcome of the inquest the truth would only be uncovered if a full and independent inquiry was to take place. The 50-year-old, who will not be attending the inquest at Westminster Coroner’s Court, said: “There ought to be a full independent inquiry in order to establish the truth of what happened. This is the only way we are going to get to the truth.” In the days following Mr Young’s death, Scotland Yard was urged to investigate a potential “ring of death” after it emerged that four of his close friends had all died in similar circumstances. Financial adviser Johnny Elichaoff, 55; Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky; property tycoon, Robert Curtis, 47 and entrepreneur Paul Castle all died recently in apparent suicides. They were all associates of Mr Young and all were thought to have been involved in business dealings with him. There were also claims that Mr Young may have been murdered by the Russian or Turkish mafia over unpaid debts, with one associate claiming he had been hung out of the window of London's Dorchester Hotel by gangsters as a warning. In the weeks after his death, his ex-wife said she was even concerned for her own safety and that of her their two daughters. Michelle Young is still battling for the truth She said: “I’m now traumatised, always looking over my shoulder and I’m very cautious whenever I cross the road or have to take a train. I can’t remember when I slept properly without being woken up with nightmares. “I believe there are people who would be happy for Scot’s secrets to die with him and for the whereabouts of his money to remain hidden. “I’m terribly worried that a number of people who were friends or associates of Scot’s have all died in similar circumstances.” • Scot Young: Friend questions whether death was suicide • Divorced tycoon Scot Young left mental health clinic hours before death But it has since been revealed that Mr Young, who had just split from his American girlfriend, Noelle Reno, had twice been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and had walked out of a psychiatric unit, just hours before his death. The Metropolitan Police has maintained there are no suspicious circumstances. Scot Young with his American girlfriend Noelle Reno Mr Young, who was brought up in a tenement block in Dundee, became a financial fixer for the mega-rich and was at one stage thought to be worth £400 million. In the 1990s he and Michelle and their two daughters, Sasha and Scarlet, lived in a Palladian mansion in Oxfordshire and flew between their other homes in Florida and Monaco in private jets. But after the breakdown of his marriage in 2006, he claimed to have lost his entire fortune, when a vast property deal in Russia, entitled Project Moscow, went sour. Mrs Young alleged that his bankruptcy claims were cynical plot to avoid splitting his fortune with her and claimed he had used a network of friends and associates to help him hide hundreds of millions of pounds from the courts. In January 2013 he was jailed for six months for contempt of court, after failing to reveal the full extent of his finances. Mrs Young is still locked in a battle to reveal the extent of her ex-husband’s hidden fortune and get what she claims is rightfully hers. She has since set up a foundation to help other divorced women who claim their ex-husbands are hiding assets.
