Launched in 2012, the scheme provides a platform for the successful applicants to gain vocational insight and understanding to the meetings and events sector through a year-long work placement. The scheme also allows the agency to strengthen relationships with academic institutions offering event management degrees. \nWorking with universities throughout the UK, Ashfield Meetings & Events shortlisted 12 undergraduates to attend a rigorous assessment centre in May. The assessment itself consisted of group exercises, individual presentations, a tour of the head office facilities, a company overview presentation, a question and answer session with existing agency staff and IT assessments. Six placements have been offered. Marianna Zacharia, Alice Brown, Milly Pickles, Katherine Matthews and Miles Wood all studying event management degrees have joined the company as Project Executives this week. This year Ashfield has offered an additional placement opportunity to a Business and Management student in the Marketing department, Sarah Moore joins the team as a Marketing Assistant from De Montfort University. Helen Capelin (Head Of Operational Excellence) commented: “We have just completed the third year of our placement scheme and have said goodbye, but not farewell, to our most recent set of undergraduates. We are pleased to welcome the new class of undergraduates to our headquarters this week. Following their week long induction into the company and individual teams we will be looking to provide them with experiences and opportunities that will help demonstrate the realities of a future career in event management.” Ashfield Meetings & Events have recently welcomed back two previous placement students. Sarah Gledhill and Bethany Matthewson who have both re-joined the company as Project Executives. Helen added: “We are thrilled to see Sarah and Bethany back with us. It is testament to the scheme - as well as the skills and hard work that they contributed during their placement year - that we welcomed them back after the successful completion of their final year.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:34:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
