I never wanted to wear dresses, I was always outside in jeans and a T-shirt. My friends had River Phoenix posters on their walls but I had Milton, a beautiful grey horse ridden by legendary show jumper John Whitaker . I was obsessed by Milton and dreamed of becoming an Olympic show jumper when I was older. The fact that I’m now an equestrian commentator for the American news network CNN and drive £5 million Ferraris on The Classic Car Show on Channel 5, would make up for the modelling, though. I loved cars when I was younger. I’d also think it very cool that I got to fly a Spitfire last week – the picture was on the front page of the Telegraph – at the Fairford Air Tattoo. I’m hooked on flying now: I nearly got my private pilot license a few years ago and am very tempted to finish the training now. Young, equestrian Jodie Kidd, Copyright: REX FEATURES I wasn’t a “mummy” kind of person when I was younger and didn’t think much about having children. Motherhood is much better than I ever expected it to be: it’s only when you have a child that you understand unconditional love. I hope to give my son, Indio, who is nearly four, all the things my parents gave me when I was younger. I grew up in Sussex, surrounded by animals: my younger self would be pleased to see that I still live in Sussex, in a cottage, with eight chickens, four dogs and two horses. It’s a mini version of what I had growing up. Who knows if Indio will be a keen rider but I’m not going to stop him from being anything he wants to be. I’m looking forward to growing old in some respects: thirties and forties are a really cool age; you’ve made enough mistakes to learn from and are settled into your skin. Plus there’s still time for me to fulfill my childhood dreams and become an Olympic showjumper. Just look at John Whitaker, he’s still winning Nation’s Cups in his late fifties. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:25:11.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
