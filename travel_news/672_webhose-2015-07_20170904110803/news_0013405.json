If you ask the Chileans, they will tell you that Pucon, at the northern end of the Lake District, is the adventure capital of Chile.\nWhat Pucon lacks in the form of glaciers, it more than makes up for with volcanoes, active ones at that. Pucon bears an uncanny resemblance to Queenstown, New Zealand. It’s perched on the edge of Villarrica Lake, under the smouldering gaze of the volcano with the same name.\nAnd here, if you can’t hike it, you can bike it; if you can’t sail it, you can raft or kayak it; if you can’t ski it, you can snowboard it; if you can’t ride it, you can zip line it.

Only 10 minutes drive from Pucon, the hotel is part luxury lodge, part holistic retreat and by far the most opulent way to explore the best that the upper Lake District has to offer.\nVira Vira means “Herb of Life” in the indigenous Mapuche language. And when you see\nthe location of the hotel, surrounded by the Liucura River and 40ha of wilderness, you too will feel the medicinal qualities of the landscape.\nSwiss owners Michael and Claudia Paravicini were so drawn to the location, that they packed up and relocated their family here four years ago. After a very successful career in international banking, travelling a million air miles a year and staying in hotels all over the world, their vision was clear – to create a hacienda-style hotel, like nothing else seen before in Chile.

Source: Supplied\nThey had no hotel or farming experience whatsoever; just a love of the land and a dream to create something luxurious, yet sustainable; chic but comfortable; something world-class, yet undeniably Chilean. Mission accomplished.\nSo with the help of a local architect and builder, Michael and his stylish wife, Claudia, designed all the decor, determined to showcase the talents of local artisans, using native woods and one-off art works. So popular are some of her design choices, that soon they will open a boutique on-site, so that guests can take home a little piece of Vira Vira with them.\nLife at Vira Vira revolves around the opulent main lodge with the restaurant, bar and library ensconced here. The activities desk staff will help you plan your itinerary, catering it exclusively to your interests. So whether that includes floating down the river on a raft or kayak, fly fishing, or hiking to a lake, the wonderful staff will turn your wishlist into a to-do list.\nThe sustainability of the property is an underlying theme and guests are encouraged to explore the farm and dairy, as that is part of the Vira Vira experience. In order to be as self-sufficient as possible, they farm turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese, wild boar, cows, sheep and goats. Thermal pools of Termas los Pozones, Pucon, Araucania Region, Chile.

The cows are milked daily, keeping the fully certified dairy in constant production of milk, yoghurt, cream as well as an amazing selection of artisanal cheeses.\nThe veggie patch will make even the greenest of thumbs feel inadequate. In perfect rows you will find cabbages the size of watermelons, fennel, asparagus, zucchini and rhubarb, and the list of organic produce goes on and on.\nIt is no surprise then, with so much emphasis on the organic produce, that meal times are a four-course culinary celebration. The kitchen is run by chef Mario Arancibia, who creates a daily menu with two meat and one vegetarian option for both lunch and dinner, paired with the perfect Chilean wine for each course.\nVira Vira has 21 guest rooms. There are six suites in the main building; 12 opulent villas along the river; and three rooms in the owners’ hacienda that cater more for families.\nThe split-level villas are the highlight, with both an indoor and outdoor bath tub overlooking the river and a fireplace stacked with wood.

For a stroll through forest, the hike to Lago Escondida takes you over bridges made of petrified wood and past 1000-year-old trees called Monkey Puzzles. A more heart-pumping hike is the one to El Claro waterfall.\nAnother incentive for making it to the end of any of the activities are the smiling Vira Vira staff, armed with freshly baked treats.\nOne of the most dramatic climbs you can do is up to the crater of the Villarrica volcano. However, volcanic activity meant it was closed.\nThere is a more serene volcanic activity of offer – the Los Pozones thermal rock pools. Not only are they in a stunning location beside a river, they are the only geothermal pools that are in their natural environment; all the others in the area have been incorporated into hotels.\nThe most memorable activity for me was meeting Rodolfo Coombs at his ranch, Huepil Malal (Rainbow Horses). He is a third-generation horseman who trained the Spanish Olympic equestrian team for 16 years. He is the real-deal “gaucho” or “Huasso” (Chilean cowboy). His way with horses is a joy to behold.\nHis 200ha ranch is home to 45 well-trained Chilean horses called “criollo”. You do not need to be an experienced rider, as you could not be in more capable hands.\nRodolfo’s horses will comfortably take you through the most pristine Andean mountain scenery; and en route make sure you take a turn riding next to the great man, so that he can regale you with some of his wonderful stories.\nGO2\nGETTING THERE\nLAN Airlines operates seven one-stop flights each week from Sydney to Santiago, Chile, via Auckland, with onward connections to Temuco (100km fromo Pucon).
