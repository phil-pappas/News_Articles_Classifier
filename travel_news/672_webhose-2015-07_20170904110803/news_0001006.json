James Martin \nScents are important to humans. It's not because the normal folks among us study fragrances to get better at telling them apart; scents pass through one fewer brain synapse--so we remember scent a little more vividly than tastes and sights. \nThus we tend to like good-smelling things. And good-smelling people. Scents have changed through the ages, and were very important in the dark eras of the bath-free life. \nDid you know that you can learn all about the the evolution and philosophy of fragrance on your European vacation? It's not a hidden topic. Even the little \"sovereign landlocked microstate\" of Andorra has a Perfume Museum: \n\"Visitors to the museum are introduced to the history of the perfume concept, the name of which derives from the Latin per fumus , meaning ‘through smoke’, and which was originally conceived as a way to talk to Gods as well as a tool for seduction. The museum reveals the way in which perfume was forced onto pigeons by Patricians who would make them fly through their chambers to perfume the spaces; and that perfume is considered one of the 74 arts of the Kama Sutra\" ~ Andorra’s Perfume Museum: The Art of Scent Florence, Italy \nIf you think of scent in a personal way, you can go to Florence. Aquaflor will make you up a scent tailored to who you are and how you smell normally. They also give classes in perfume mixing. See: Exotic Scents for Discerning Tourists . Be nice while you're inside the interesting historic building and maybe they'll let you take a whiff of Duende, which will set you back a cool 1800 euro for a small bottle. Don't worry, you're worth it. You can buy less expensive perfumes there as well, of course. \nIf you don't want to head into central Florence, you might stop at Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella in the neighborhood of the main train station to pick up something smelly in the recently restored antique pharmacy. It's one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe. It also presents a learning opportunity for scent hounds and a photo op for camera buffs. France \nThere is generally a single reason to visit the town of Versailles on a day trip from Paris. The Palace of Versailles is enormous and perhaps enough to keep you busy for a day--especially considering the little hunting lodge it was designed to be. \nBut of course there is more--even more than the perfect omelet I consumed there on my first visit to the town. A perfume library called Osmotheque just might give you that whiff of history you crave after visiting the palace. If your burning question is \"what did Napoleon smell like?\" this could be the place for you. \nIn expensive Paris , you might not expect for a perfume museum to be free, especially one that allows you to walk through the rooms of \"a very lovely Napoleon III town house built in 1860 by Lesoufaché, a student of Garnier.\" See: The House of Fragonard, a story of perfume making . Cologne, Germany \nIf you're planning a vacation in Germany, you would do well to go to Cologne , where you will find the House of Fragrances 4711 . \nThey also offer workshops, especially if you speak German: \n\"Compose your own personal Eau de Cologne under the instruction of experts in our flagship store in Cologne and learn about the perfumer´s art. The public fragrance workshop is held in German and takes place on Thursdays from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. Individual fragrance workshops in other languages are available upon request.\" \nThe original Eau de Cologne was developed over 220 years ago and called 4711 because that was the number assigned to the house by occupying French troops. It's an interesting story . \nI hope you'll sniff around these fragrant museums and workshops to find the scent you crave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:21:37.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
