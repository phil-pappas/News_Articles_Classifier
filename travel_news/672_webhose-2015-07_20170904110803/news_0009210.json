France staging the competition is a clear sign of the sport’s rapid growth across the Channel.\nIn the UK every year, golfers avidly plan trips to courses in Spain, Portugal and Italy – yet France is often overlooked. I find this curious given that France can be reached far more easily and more affordably on self-drive trips.\nMy husband James and I are passionate about golf. I play five or six times a week if I can – because of my early morning hours on BBC Breakfast, I have time to get out on the course during the day.\nNaga played golf at Dinard (pictured), Granville and the Pléneuf-Val-André courses on holiday in France\nI’ve played in France before but this was the first time I’ve done the trip as a driving holiday, taking our car on a cross-Channel ferry. I particularly liked the fact that we could pack our clubs and suitcases in the boot of the car – flying with sports equipment can be a bit complicated and expensive.\nThe trip to Brittany and Normandy was quite an adventure for us, offering the chance to play on some great courses. We sailed with Brittany Ferries to St Malo before teeing off at Dinard, Granville and the lovely Pléneuf-Val-André course.\nI have very fond memories of playing in France because during my previous trip – to the Château Golf des Sept Tours in the Loire Valley – I managed to score a hole-in-one during my first round. I had only been playing for about three months, so it was an unforgettable experience.\nBOOK A GOLFING TRIP TO FRANCE Brittany Ferries ( brittany-ferries.co.uk ) offers golfing holidays with Awayday breaks from £57pp, including a round of golf at Pléneuf-Val-André and return ferry crossings with car, based on four sharing. Call 0871 244 1818 for more details.\nIt was also during that trip that I discovered I could combine golf with my other great passion – food. The cuisine everywhere in France is truly fantastic.\nThe itinerary this time was cleverly arranged so that there wasn’t much driving involved – the focus was purely on enjoying the golf.\nI’m pleased to report that on each of the courses we played, I won every game. My husband is a better golfer – his handicap is just seven – but he just had a nightmare couple of days.\nIt didn’t spoil his holiday, however. We’ve both learned over the years to leave golf on the golf course. It’s like leaving work at the office, isn’t it? Leave golf on the golf course and then enjoy your meal – there’s no point in ruining wonderful food by thinking about the poor shots you played earlier in the day.\nNaga Munchetty (left) with Alvaro Quiros, Jodie Kidd and Di Dougherty at the BMW PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club in Virginia Water\nI really love golf because it gets you out into the fresh air. Some people play as a networking thing, to make the right contacts at work. I don’t think I’ve ever done any business on a golf course. I meet lots of people and you swap stories, but I’m more interested in the golf. When I play, I’m quite obsessed about my own game – it’s quite selfish.\nAll the courses we visited in France were great, but Pléneuf-Val-André was stunning. It had some beautiful holes, and I played really well, nearly to my handicap. The 9th hole in particular has some spectacular views along the coast.\nWe’re already thinking about a return trip to France – I would go every year if I could, but it’s a matter of finding the time. It’s the perfect holiday for me: playing golf in the morning, strolling around a lovely historic place such as St Malo in the afternoon, and then sitting down to a sumptuous dinner in the evening.\nIn golfing terms, France is a location par excellence!\nRead more: Cross Channel Ferries to France & Spain - Brittany Ferries", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ISjoXp", "http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-07-12T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:26:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
