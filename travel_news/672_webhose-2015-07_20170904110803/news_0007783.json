And lost nine times.\nThere's actress Angela Landsbury, nominated a dozen times for an Emmy award, and came up empty 12 times.\nThere's me in high school. (Don't ask.)\nThen, there's Dan Saban.\nThe former police chief in Buckeye ran against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio as a Republican in 2004, and lost.\nHe ran again as a Democrat in 2008, and lost.\nHe considered running again in 2012, but lost momentum.\nAnd he now says he will run against Arpaio in 2016, as a Republican.\n“It’s a general desire to make things right for public safety in Maricopa County,” he told the Republic.\nSaban has spoken before of the lengths Arpaio has gone to discredit him. It's not the lengths, however, it's the depths. I'm not sure politics has gone lower than what happened the first time Saban challenged Arpaio in 2004. (We should get this out of the way since it's bound to come up again.)\nAn anti-Saban commercial aired claiming that Saban's adoptive mother alleged he raped her when he was a teenager. The accusation came 30 years after the alleged incident. His mother's allegation was investigated and no charges were filed.\nAccording to news reports and court records, one of the woman's other adult children said, \"I consider my mother to be a habitual liar.\" Another said, \"I feel that (my mother) is a very sick and deranged person who is very much in need of serious psychological therapy.\"\nStill, the mere mention of something like that made voters wary.\nWhen Saban ran again in 2008 The Arizona Republic 's editorial board endorsed him, saying in part, \"Now, Maricopa County voters have the opportunity to elect a lawman, not a showman.\"\nArpaio won in a landslide.\nMaricopa County voters love a showman.\nArpaio figured that out from the moment he was elected sheriff in 1992.\nHe put inmates in pink underwear. He served them green baloney. He reinstated chain gangs. He created tent city. None of these things had anything to do with law enforcement. It was all show. And it worked.\nThe reason it worked is that, in the end, criminals are nothing but bullies. And bullies frighten people. Arpaio made it his mission to humiliate the bullies. It's great for boosting a politician's approval ratings.\nWhen that's not enough, when he's in legal trouble (which he is a lot) or when he's getting bad publicity (which he gets a lot) Arpaio is not afraid to get down and dirty.\nAnd because he is constantly soliciting donations, and getting them, he has the campaign war chest to do so in 2016.\nWhich means that when the next election is over it will most likely be déjà Joe all over again.", "external_links": ["http://azc.cc/1SeCYTN"], "published": "2015-07-29T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:14:13.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
