Amtrak, EDPA No. 2:15-CV-2741 (Kline & Specter case) • Iban, et. al. v. Amtrak, EDPA No. 2:15-CV-2744 (SMBB case) \nAttorney Tom Kline of Kline & Specter, P.C., who is representing Blair Berman as well as several other Plaintiffs, said following the filing, \"The admission of liability by Amtrak in the first two filed cases is an important step in a longer process in front of the injured and the families of the victims of this horrible tragedy.\" \nAttorney Robert J. Mongeluzzi of Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett & Bendesky, P.C., who is representing Felicidad Iban and several other plaintiffs, stated, \"There is still much work to be done now that Amtrak has admitted fault in the initial filed cases.
