In fact, it's 35.6% long-term earnings-per-share growth rate gives it a highly-favorable price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.38 and suggests you should buy Travelzoo up to $15 now. Founded in 1998, the company went public in 2003 at $7 per share and has seen its stock price soar as high as $110 in 2004 before gradually working its way down over the years to its current range of $9-to-$14. In just the past three weeks, it's risen 10% only to drop 20%. The short-lived gain was driven by growing expectations that the July 16 earnings report would beat analyst's consensus estimate. The stock then retreated when Travelzoo announced that it had slightly beaten sales expectations but missed the earnings estimate by $0.01 per share. The inflated expectations were unfulfilled. But that price adjustment has now created a tremendous buying opportunity. The Baton stock-picking methodology based on legendary mutual fund manager Peter Lynch has now boosted its score of the company from 93% to 98%. The reason our Lynch model likes Travelzoo so much is that it now has a PEG ratio of only 0.56, which means the company is growing its earnings at a little less than double the rate the market is currently valuing them. However, Lynch also felt that in order to be sustainable over the long haul a company needed to be growing its earnings at an annual rate of less than 50%, which Travelzoo satisfies with its earnings growth rate of 36%. Lynch also preferred companies with a low debt-to-equity ratio, which for Travelzoo is a slam dunk since it has no long term debt at all. He also assigned a bonus point to companies with a net-cash-to-price ratio above 30%, which Travelzoo just qualifies for with a ratio of 36.1%. In other words, Lynch liked to buy companies with high earnings growth but also not burdened with too much debt, and that's exactly what Travelzoo is. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T18:35:57.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
