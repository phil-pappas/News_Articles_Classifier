The largest spa facility in Norway is funded by a private investor and is scheduled to open in December 2015 . \nThe overall planning area of the project amounts to 10.500 sqm, with 6.500 sqm of Day Spa area. \nThermarium has brought its entire range of know-how and expertise to this project. This includes the overall concept, the engineering and interior design services as well as the final construction. \n\"On The Well project Thermarium has added unique know how and superior quality, and at the same time showed great flexibility in a complex constructional project,\" says Thomas Gundersen , project manager, THE WELL. \nSome of the project's highlights are the pool areas, which have been designed as a lavish landscape, and a shower grotto featuring a realistic stream with several trickles of water cascading down the sides of the rock grotto. \nThe hot rooms entice guests to explore the spa as it creates a unique and interesting well-being ambiance. The art deco area, for instance, will feature a pool and a steam room designed with state-of-the-art materials and a highly creative interplay of different shapes and colors. \nIn a world of lights the Aurora Laconium features shifting lighting moods that enhance relaxation, while the Ambilight Cinema Sauna provides visual well-being with lights on a TV screen. The Japanese area with its distinctive design and finishes offers unique well-being experiences in a sauna, steam room, fire room and a meditation room. A Turkish bath / Hamam serves as a secret haven for guests paying for this treatment. \nThis project is unique in its appearance and constructional complexity in all of Norway and reflects the recent growth and development of the country's spa industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T07:44:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
