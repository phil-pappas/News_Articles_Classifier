Image Courtesy of Outdoor Technology \nKeeping our gadgets charged while traveling is always a challenge, particularly when visiting a remote destination. Modern travelers have become more dependent on their smartphones, digital cameras, tablets, and other devices, and when they start to run low on power it can be very frustrating. Fortunately, there are some good options for staying powered up, even when traveling through some of the most demanding environments imaginable. Take for example the Kodiak USB Power Bank from Outdoor Technology , a product designed to provide portable power in a compact package, no matter where you go. \nOver the past couple of years, the market for portable batteries that can keep our favorite electronic gadgets charged while on the go has become a very crowded one. There are literally dozens of companies that produce these types of devices, which have increasingly become mandatory gear for travelers. The Kodiak is Outdoor Technology's entry into that market, and it has certainly brought more than a few features to help it stand out from the competition. Those features including a large 6000 mAh battery capable of providing enough power to recharge most smartphones 2-3 times, and a smart, flexible USB port capable of charging our devices very quickly. \nOne of the first things you'll notice about the Kodiak is that it is completely encased in a thick rubber skin that provides it with a level of protection that many of its competitors simply can't match. In fact, Outdoor Technology built the charger to withstand the punishment that comes along with adventure travel by making it waterproof, dust-proof, and shock resistant. It carries a rating of IP67, which means it can survive being immersed in water up to 1 meter and is completely resistant to dust or sand. That same rubberized casing also ensures that it is capable of being dropped up to 2 meters without fear of failure as well. \nPeeling back the tightly-sealed, built-in lid on the Kodiak reveals both a standard USB and micro-USB port. The first of those ports is capable of providing an output of up to a 2.1 Amps, which will allow most smartphones and tablets to charge at a surprisingly quick and steady rate. The micro-USB port is used to recharge the Kodiak's internal battery, and Outdoor Technology has wisely provided a cable in the box that facilities that process. \nAlso under the lid is a soft-touch power button that initiates the charging process. That button is lined by a series of four green lights which indicate the level of charge that the Kodiak currently holds. Those little lights are a handy reminder of when you need to plug the battery pack into a wall outlet or other power source to replenish its juice too. \nI found the Kodiak USB Power Bank to be a fantastic option for adventure travelers. Its ruggedized body makes it the perfect choice for traveling in remote areas, and its ability to charge your device quickly and efficiently is appreciated as well. Outdoor Technology has put a great deal of thought into the design of the product, making it as compact and lightweight as possible (it tips the scales at just 9.4 ounces/266 grams), while still managing to provide a battery that can store enough power to charge an iPhone , GoPro camera , small tablet, or similar device. This makes is an incredibly useful source of power for anyone who regularly finds themselves on the go, whether you're jetting off to the far side of the planet, or running errands around town. \nThe Kodiak was so good at performing its job that my only two complaints were that I wished the internal battery were a bit larger, and it would have been nice to be able to charge more than one device at the same time. Fortunately, Outdoor Technology feels exactly the same way, and is planning to release a larger version of the product – called the Kodiak Plus – which will come equipped with a 10,000 mAh battery and an additional USB port as well. For minimalist travelers, the company also has plans to launch a Kodiak Mini, which will be a smaller version of the product with a 2200 mAh battery too. Both of those devices should begin shipping in March. \nThe standard Kodiak model that I have been testing is available now for $49.95 and in a variety of colors. That's a very reasonable price for a USB battery pack that delivers so much performance in such a compact, yet rugged form. When the Kodiak Plus is released next month it is expected to run $139.95, while the Kodiak Mini will come with a $39.95 price tag.
