Using this existing capacity has, however, been delayed by the Mayor of London who has directed refusal of planning permission for extra aircraft stands at London City Airport.\nThe ability to fully utilise existing capacity at London City Airport also depends on the willingness of Government to uphold the airport’s appeal against the Mayor of London’s ruling.\nDeclan Collier, Chief Executive Officer, London City Airport, believes the opportunity to deliver extra capacity into the London airport system in the short term is too great – and too greatly needed – to be hamstrung by one person:\n“London City Airport recognises that any new runway in the South East is unlikely to be delivered until the late 2020s, and believes that better use of existing airport capacity must be made in the interim period.\n“We already have permission to increase flight movements – we simply require a permission to expand the airport’s existing infrastructure in order to inject much-needed capacity into the London system pending the delivery of any new runway favoured by the Government. Extra capacity could be in operation at LCY within 18 months.\n“Airports bring immense benefits – to the communities in which they operate, through employment, education, training and community relations, and to the wider economy – as well as facilitating national and international trade and providing businesses with the opportunity to develop and invest.\n“It would be a travesty if London and the UK were not allowed to make the best use of airport capacity in the short term, as well as in the medium and long terms.”\nSource:- London City Airport\nRelated Posts Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Refurbishment of the northern runway – Work starts 2014 London City Airport breaks 27 year old monthly traffic record MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
