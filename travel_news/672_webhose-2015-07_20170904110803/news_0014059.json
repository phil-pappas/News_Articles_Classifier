In the heart of one of Europe`s dynamic business destinations, the new fully integrated extension will see the venue`s event space double in size, as it extends along the River Lagan embankment taking full advantage of the stunning riverside views. \nFrom May 2016, Belfast Waterfront Conference and Exhibition Centre will offer 7,000m2 of flexible space and wow up to 4,600 guests with a brand new event experience. With the joint ethos of `your success is our success`, the combined forces of Team Belfast and the centres own staff will ensure that each event stands out in the heart of the city and in the minds of delegates. Visitors to the `Visit Belfast` Stand D18 at the Meetings Show from 7-9 July, will enjoy a revised version of the 3d flythrough including a time lapse video footage of progress on the new build from the eastern corner of the extension, overlooking the river. The footage showcases the steel erection of the new entrance, exterior terraces, conference and exhibition hall 2 and 3 additional meeting rooms on the top floor. At the western end, initial steelwork erection was carried out over the existing Waterfront service yard situated adjacent to Hilton Belfast. This area has the longest spans of the project, as the grid is 23.5m x 6m in order to accommodate turning trucks in the service yard while loading and unloading. In addition a service core will ensure the safe and efficient movement of goods and delegates throughout the entire venue. And a vehicle lift to Hall 1 will prove invaluable to clients for large-scale events and elaborate stage productions. Recent images illustrate how the new extension seamlessly integrates with the original Waterfront centre as well as how the steel frames of Hall 1 and Hall 2 are extending towards each other, where they will soon join to boast flat floor space of over 2,500m2. The 2,000-seat auditorium will remain the centrepiece of the new world-class conference centre, complemented by 2 interconnecting flexible halls, meeting rooms accommodating up to 200 delegates and a dedicated riverside entrance leading to a bright, spacious 660m2 foyer. At 1,805m2, Hall 1 offers clear span space for large scale events or may be sub-divided via retractable walls into four smaller spaces. Equipped with the latest event technology, up to 180 exhibition stands can be brought to life in this flexible and dynamic space to provide a truly interactive exhibit. This stylish space can also be transformed into a stunning gala venue for up to 1,000 dinner guests. And with a ceiling height of 9m to stage the most elaborate of productions, clients are sure to be dazzled by the spectacular set up, superb food and second to none service. Alternatively, this multipurpose space can accommodate 2,000 theatre style. The adjacent Hall 2 covers a clear span space of 700m2 leading onto an exterior terrace with unrestricted river views. It is perfect place to host a banquet for up to 450 guests, or accommodate 55 exhibition stands. There`s never been a better time to visit Northern Ireland`s capital city as it embarks on the next momentous chapter in becoming a world-class business tourism destination with the development of Belfast Waterfront as an international conference centre. The £29.5 million development, funded by Belfast City Council, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the European Regional Development Fund, under the European Sustainable Competitiveness Programme for Northern Ireland, will be a real game-changer for Belfast improving the city’s competitiveness and attractiveness as a business tourism destination.
