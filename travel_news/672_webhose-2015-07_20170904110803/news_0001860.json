The story behind the Sheep Roast End is one of the reasons that the West Sussex club was chosen as one of the six finalists in the Yorkshire Tea Great Cricket Tea Challenge. As Beccie Deighton, assistant brand manager at Yorkshire Tea, explains: “Ebernoe CC made the shortlist for having the quirkiest way to announce the tea break that we came across in this year’s competition – the ceremonial carrying of a spit-roasted sheep across the outfield in order to serve a full roast dinner. \"That’s a proper effort – and a proper tea!” To explain further, sheep and Ebernoe go back a long way. On July 25 each year the West Sussex club celebrates a centuries-old ritual known as the Horn Fair, the origins of which are lost in the mists of time but one which we know was revived in 1864. A sheep is spit-roasted and served to cricketers between innings. . . The horns are presented to the highest scoring batsman on the winning team It is thought to date back to an annual sheep fair, on the Feast Day of St James, where farmers would bring the best of their flocks for sale. These days a sheep is spit-roasted and served to cricketers at the local club between innings. The sheep for roasting is donated by Lord Egremont, on whose Petworth House estate the cricket ground sits. The Horn Fair also includes a 45-over cricket match. The horns of the roasted sheep are presented to the highest scoring batsman on the winning team. This year, the honour and the horns went to Ollie Rose, whose 42 runs helped Ebernoe chase down the total of 145 set for them by Wessex Pilgrims. Matt Hollier top-scored for the visitors from Bournemeouth, with 40. In keeping with the tradition known as Dip the Lady, Rose had to be dropped into a water tank before being presented with his magnificent horns. All this provided magnificent entertainment for me and my fellow Great Cricket Tea Challenge judge Mike Gatting, the former England captain. It was just incredible to see how cricket and food united a community. Fantastic club, great traditions, all built around a community cricket match A few hundred spectators also enjoyed the occasion as the sheep began its slow roasting from 8am. There was a fairground and beer tent, while Land of Hope and Glory and the Test Match Special theme tune came over the loudspeakers. The highlight was the cooked sheep being ceremonially marched to the pavilion, across the road that runs inside the boundary, followed by all the players. It was a special day, one that still unites the community. “We are indebted to a great group of people who make this a very special occasion,” explained Ivan Wadey, club president for the past 50 years. “It was just incredible to see how cricket and food united a community here,” said Gatting. “Fantastic club, great traditions, and all built around a community cricket match. \"This is what cricket is all about.” Meet the other Great Cricket Tea Challenge finalists>> Bishop Thornton CC Uffington CC Newton Linford CC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T14:00:05.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
