Since then, world travel has become far easier than Fogg and his valet Passepartout's clambering on board a steam ship. Despite the rise in exotic holidays and the breadth of adventures that can be undertaken, new research from over 50s insurance and travel specialist Staysure has found that most of us are creatures of habit, preferring to visit the same destinations year on year. We can now fly all over the world (PA) Their survey of 2,000 UK adults over 50 found that 91 per cent of Britons prefer to go back to a familiar holiday destination rather than opt for somewhere new, and that one in five holidaymakers return to the same place within 12 months. But why do we do this? Are we just too lazy to make a new decision about our next trip? According to Staysure, it’s the fantastic weather, delicious food and conveninent travel times that have us coming back for more, not to mention the easy feeling of knowing where we're going. The most popular repeated destinations are the ones closest to home, Staysure found, with Cornwall , Paris and Blackpool topping the list. One of the donkeys on Blackpool beach (Getty) Of those surveyed, 41 per cent claim that they would ‘never get bored’ of visiting the same holiday spot, with the same number having stayed at the same hotel more than once. 67 year old Sally Clements from High Wycombe is one of those holidaying creatures of habit. “I’ve been to Playa Blanca in Lanzarote 25 times in the past 18 years,” she says. “My husband and I absolutely love it. We tend to stay in the same hotel and are on first name terms with the waiters in our favourite restaurants.” It’s not just about keeping a routine, though, Clements says. “It feels like we’re going to a home from home, and we’ve made some brilliant friends as a result.” Sally and her husband on holiday (Sally Clements) 60 year old Nicole Tomlin from Theydon Bois in Essex has also repeated holidays. “Me and my husband have visited the same villa in Portugal six years in a row now – we’ve even been twice in one year,” she explains. “We keep returning because it’s easy and we know the setup of where we are going, from where to get a nice load of bread in the morning, to knowing where we can get a yummy picanha at the local Portuguese steak house.” As far as holiday-going is concerned, is it just a case of sticking to what you know? Ryan Howsam, chairman of Staysure believes this is the case. “If you’ve been before, nothing beats your own recommendation.” The Algarve region of Portgual (Alamy) But is it good for us to keeping going back to the same places? Howsam wants to inspire people to try out new places if they can. “We’re encouraging people to broaden their horizons and not to get stuck in a holiday rut,” he says. “Research shows how an average couple will spend £1,700 on a holiday before they even step on the plane, so make it count!” Janis Donnelly, 62, from Sevenoaks is less keen to keep returning to the same places. “I try and avoid going back to the same destinations,” she explains. “The way I see it, I’ve only got a limited number of holidays left in my lifetime – why waste a trip going somewhere I’ve already been?” It’s a good question.
