Our guide features expert recommendations for city , beach , villa , culture , food and drink and activity holidays. 1. Paris and Normandy Paris will be the main draw for most on this AmaWaterways river cruise along the Seine. The itinerary is not short on other attractions, however, which include impressionist painter Claude Monet’s home and garden in Giverny and Rouen, a pretty town with half-timbered houses. This is where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in 1431. Rouen also has a fine cathedral that was rebuilt following heavy bombing in the Second World War. On other days there are excursions to the Normandy landing beaches and to the fishing village of Honfleur. Back in Paris passengers disembark and transfer to a hotel for two nights, with an included tour to the Musée d’Orsay. AmaWaterways ( amawaterways.co.uk ; 0800 223 5009), eight days, departures until November, 2015. From £1,878 per person including excursions and Paris hotel. 2. Loire and Bordeaux Why cruise one French river when you can combine three in a single holiday? This Fred Olsen voyage from Dover isn’t a traditional river cruise – its ocean-going ship Braemar is too big for that. However, as she is small enough to navigate the the Loire as far as Nantes and the Garonne and Gironde Rivers as far as Bordeaux, you can enjoy views of the French countryside as you sail. The highlight is two days in Bordeaux, from where there are excursions to the Médoc or Saint Émilion wine regions. Or just enjoy the city, which has a delightful old town and revamped waterfront with a stunning miroir d’eau that reflects the buildings of the 18th-century Place de la Bourse across the road. Fred Olsen Cruise Lines ( fredolsencruises.com ; 0845 868 9761) 8 nights, departs August 1, 2015. From £899 per person. 3. Monte Carlo to Marseille This itinerary is a great choice for those who want to combine France and Italy while visiting world-class cities. For a place smaller than the city of London, Monaco packs quite a punch - the annual Formula One Grand Prix, a fairytale royal family that American actress Grace Kelly married into in 1956 and Riviera glamour in spades. Where cruising is concerned excursions include everything from river rafting and day trips to Nice and Grasse to helicopter rides over the Cote d’Azur. Crystal Cruises’ luxury ship Serenity will start itineraries there in November, beginning with an overnight in the port so embarking passengers have time to see the Principality. The cruise then heads to Genoa, Florence, Rome, Naples, Ajaccio (Corsica) and Marseille. Crystal itineraries feature Monaco, where the Grand Prix is held Crystal Cruises ( crystalcruises.co.uk ; 020 7399 7601) seven days, departs November 22, 2015. From £2,439 per person, including flights. 4. Burgundy and Provence A cruise through Burgundy and Provence can mean only one thing – wine. Oenophiles shouldn’t be disappointed with this Viking river cruise, which has wine-tasting in Beaujolais. But it’s not all about the wine. You’ll also have time in Lyon, known as the gastronomic capital of France (look out for one of the bouchon restaurants for traditional dishes served in simple, rustic surrounds), and Avignon, on the beautiful Rhône River. In Vienne and Arles there’s an opportunity to learn about the impact the Romans had on France. Vienne has the remains of a temple built in honour of Emperor Augustus and his wife Livia; Arles has the remains of a theatre and baths and a 20,000-seat arena dating to 90AD that is still in use today. Enjoy wine tastings on a Viking River Cruise Viking River Cruises ( vikingrivercruises.co.uk ; 0800 319 6660) seven-night \"Portraits of Southern France\" has departures until November. From £2,745 per person, including flights and excursions. 5. Corsica A cruise in the footsteps of French general Napoléon Bonaparte on a French ship? Surely a win-win for Francophiles. That the vessel, Le Ponant, is a petit three-masted sailing yacht with room for just 64 passengers adds to the allure. The cruise starts in Nice, stops in St Tropez and then heads to Corsica, the birthplace of the “little general,” visiting the beautiful coast around Scandola/Girolata, Bonifacio, a city perched above the Mediterranean where Napoleon stayed in 1793 (A plaque outside number seven, Rue des Deux Emperors, proudly marks the spot). Other stops include Palombaggia, Baie de Roccapina and Ile Rousse. Explore Bonaficio on the southern tip of the Island of Corsica Ponant ( ponant.com ; 0800 980 4027), seven days, departs August 10, 2015. From €3,620 per person. 6. The Riviera This two-week cruise on Swan Hellenic's Minerva begins in Malaga (for excursions to the Alhambra in neighbouring Grenada) and ends in Rome, but takes in numerous other destinations en route, including Sanary-sur-Mer, Nice and Ajaccio. Other highlights include Tangier in Morocco, Minorca, Sardinia and the Italian Riviera. Swan Hellenic's Minerva cruise ship Swan Hellenic ( swanhellenic.com ; 0844 417 2413) 15 days, departs August 5, 2015. From £2,650 per person. including excursions. 7. The Loire Valley Fancy combining a river cruise with chateaux sightseeing in the Loire Valley? You can from next April, when French company CroisiEurope launches the Loire Princesse, a ship built with a side-mounted paddlewheel. The Loire, the longest river in France, is too shallow for traditional cruise boats to navigate. Choose between six or eight-night cruises that depart from Nantes and visit St Nazaire for a tour of the shipyard where the vessel was built, as well as the medieval city of Guérande and the towns of Saumur and Angers. There is also a full day tour to some of the Loire’s most-loved chateaux including Azay-le-Rideau, Villandry and Ussé. Explore the heart of the Loire Valley on a river cruise with CroisiEurope CroisiEurope ( croisieurope.co.uk ; 020 8328 1281) six or eight nights, departures until October, 2015. From £1,329 per person. 8. Monaco Grand Prix The spectacle of a Formula One Grand Prix can be enjoyed on numerous racing tracks around the world but nothing beats the atmosphere in Monaco, where drivers speed through the hilly, winding streets of the Principality. Go there on a cruise and you can not only beat the crowds arriving by road but also stay at the heart of the action. Azamara Club Cruises’ special package provides a Tribune K seat by the harbour, which offers unrestricted views of the lower part of the circuit and a big screen so you can watch the action around the rest of the course. You’ll also have a day and an evening in both St Tropez and Cannes in France, and Livorno in Italy, for excursions to Florence or Pisa. Azamara Club Cruises ( azamaraclubcruises.com ; 0844 493 4016) five nights, departs May 25, 2016. From £1,236 per person. 9. Normandy A good option for those who want to try cruising for the first time, this short cruise across the Channel with Saga takes in a number of ports closer to home before heading across the channel. First stop is St Peter Port in Guernsey, one of the only parts of the British Isles to be occupied during the Second World War. From Le Havre in France, a city almost entirely rebuilt, there are excursions to Paris. It’s a long day out so a trip to the pretty village of Honfleur or Calvados tasting might hold more appeal. From Cherbourg the following day tours go to the beaches where Allied forces landed on June 6 1944 and the war cemetery at Bayeux, the first French town to be liberated after D-Day. Or visit the Bayeux tapestry, depicting William the Conqueror’s invasion of England in 1066. Saga's voyage to Normandy is ideal for first-time cruisers Saga Cruises ( saga.co.uk ; 0800 096 0079) four nights, departs September 17, 2015. From £845 per person. 10. St Tropez Brigitte Bardot put St Tropez on the map in the 1950s but remarkably the city has lost none of its allure. So what better way to arrive than in style on SeaDream II, a sleek yacht that looks right at home among the floating gin palaces that dot the Riviera ports visited on this cruise? It starts in Rome and ends in Barcelona, visiting Livorno (for Florence), Portofino, Monte Carlo, St Tropez, Cassies and Collioure en route. Arrive in St Tropez in style on board the sleek Sea Dream II yacht SeaDream Yacht Club ( seadream.co.uk ; 0800 783 1373) seven days, departs October 3, 2015. From £3,921 per person.
