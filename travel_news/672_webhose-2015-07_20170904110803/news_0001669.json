As its 50th anniversary nears, Universal Studios Hollywood is undergoing a level of construction unlike anything the movie theme park has seen in the last half-century. ( Brady MacDonald ) \nWhile Universal has worked with Peter Jackson on the story and look of the new attraction, the standalone backstory of Skull Island: Reign of Kong won’t be based on the director’s 2005 film -- or the 1933 original, or the 2017 prequel, for that matter. \nKong has had a long history at Universal theme parks. \nKongfrontation debuted with the opening of Universal Studios Florida in 1990. Set in New York City, the attraction featured an open-air aerial tram ride and a massive Kong animatronic with a bad case of banana breath. The ride closed in 2002 to make way for the Revenge of the Mummy indoor roller coaster. \nThe Florida ride was based on the original Universal Studios Hollywood backlot tram tour attraction, King Kong Encounter, which was destroyed during a 2008 fire. The California attraction was replaced in 2010 with the King Kong 360 3D drive-through film experience. \nUniversal Orlando officials say the new Skull Island attraction will be more advanced and immersive than the previous Kong attractions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T21:01:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
