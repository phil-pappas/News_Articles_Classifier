Know the law \nFor companies doing business internationally, cybersecurity has to be a key concern. Every time employees cross a border, their laptop bags represent a potential security problem. Even laying aside concerns about lost devices, every country has different laws about how much access border officials have to the information contained on computers coming into their countries. \nLegally speaking, you may not have much to worry about — if your organization is used to working in a particular country, you’re probably aware of the laws you need to follow. But not all officials play by the rules, nor do the local companies that you may compete with. Business travelers in China, for instance, have had their laptops and mobile devices hacked on a regular basis. You need to protect your company’s interests, as well as your data. Being able to submit a competitive bid or finding a reputable vendor may depend on it. \nKeeping all your crucial company data in the cloud is only a useful response if you’re using tools that are secure. You don’t just want excellent uptime — you need guarantees that your data is encrypted while in transit, and that the data centers hosting your data are secure. Your only other option is to ask your employees to leave their laptops at home when going abroad, which isn’t particularly helpful or effective.
