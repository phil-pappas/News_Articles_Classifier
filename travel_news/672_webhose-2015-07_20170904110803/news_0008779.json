The Detroit Institute of Arts is installing dozens of artwork reproductions outside in the Detroit area this summer, as its \"Inside/Out\" effort that it started five years ago expands to several other U.S. cities. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) \n\"It's wonderful to be able to share the DIA throughout our amazing state,\" Annmarie Erickson, the museum's chief operating officer, told The Associated Press in an email.\nDuring last year's bankruptcy proceedings, some creditors pushed for the city to look into the sale of assets, including city-owned pieces in the Detroit Institute of Arts. The threat prompted the creation of the so-called Grand Bargain â€” commitments from the state, major corporations, foundations and others to donate $800 million over 20 years meant to soften cuts to city pensions while placing pieces in the DIA into a trust and out of the reach of debtor demands.\nNow, the museum is launching the programs \"as a benefit to all of the Michigan taxpayers who helped safeguard the DIA's collection through state contributions to Detroit's pensioners,\" Erickson said.\nThe museum said that it is sending the painting \"The Nut Gatherers\" for exhibitions in Flint and Midland. The French artist by William-Adolphe Bouguereau painted the picture of two girls reclining in the grass in 1882. The painting goes on display Aug. 5 through Oct. 11 at the Flint Institute of Arts and Oct. 17 through at the Midland Center for the Arts and the Alden B. Dow Museum of Science.\nThe display of reproductions from the collection also will extend beyond the Detroit metropolitan area. Wayne, Oakland and Macomb County voters support the museum through a property tax levy, and the museum now operates its Inside/Out program at locations around those counties.\n\"The museum will install two outdoor exhibitions of 15 reproductions each summer, focusing on locations in the 45 counties that the Michigan Council for Arts and Cultural Affairs has identified as underserved,\" the museum said in a statement.\nThe museum also is extending its school, professional development and conservation services to users statewide.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.dia.org\nProgram details: http://bit.ly/1VNout5\n___\nFollow David N.
