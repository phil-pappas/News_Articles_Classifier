The recovery from the last recession is proving different from previous ones in that there are no gains to be shown in productivity increases. The recent report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies emphasises that this is the picture across all sectors of British industry. Both Labour and Tory Governments have been successful in tackling what they saw as long-term welfare dependency amongst individual claimants and families. Both administrations have moved people from benefit into work. Good, in one sense, for the welfare bill, as expenditure on Jobseeker’s Allowance and other out-of-work benefits, has been reduced. But this \"saving\" has largely been cancelled out by expenditure under the Government’s tax credit scheme which tops up low paid workers’ wages to a decent minimum. When Tony Blair appointed me to the New Labour government, my job was to think the thinkable on welfare. In truth I was also concerned with thinking the workable. It was Gordon Brown’s unthinkable expansion of the tax credits system that created the welfare monster we have today. The annual bill for Family Credit, a predecessor to tax credit, when it was introduced by Sir Keith Joseph in 1986, came to £0.1 billion. Following a decade of Gordon Brown’s Leviathan system the bill has climbed to a staggering £30 billion. It has been a wonderful fig leaf for politicians to say they’re helping the low paid but, as with all new benefits, dependency on tax credits has grown. But the new dependency class is now employers. It is at this point that welfare reform can link into this most urgent wider economic debate on increasing productivity. Welfare reform mark 2 must be concerned with how government can support firms to invest in both capital and training to ensure that those on low pay now can earn productivity increases which are to be reflected in the real value of their wage packets. Nobody should underestimate how difficult this task will be. I would suggest that the Chancellor sets himself a target by the end of this Parliament to have so encouraged productivity rises that the tax credit bill is reduced beyond recognition. Such an outcome is inevitable once real wages decrease the size of eligibility of any individual or group of workers. It is also important to put the pressure on employers to pay better wages for those individuals moving into their employment for the first time. Hence I would advocate that the Chancellor seriously thinks of how any initial reduction in eligibility to tax credits will increase this pressure on employers to reduce the welfare dependency of a new class of claimants. It is difficult to think of a more political Chancellor than the present incumbent. His political expertise, however, doesn’t mean that he is error proof. He needs to remember his Omnishambles Budget where he not only reduced the top rate of tax, but saw it result in such a backlash of public opinion that the Tory lead over Labour didn’t materialise until people went into the polling booth in early May. To present himself as a benefit cutter, without ensuring the protection, particularly of existing working claimants, will probably lead to a similar backlash and undermining of the Tory position in the polls and a huge question mark raised over the Chancellor’s suitability in any leadership contest toward the end of this Parliament. How might a longer-term policy be rolled out now by addressing the two new fast growing areas of dependency? First that of employers and secondly that group of landlords who have enjoyed record increases in income as the queue of low paid workers seeking help with their rent lengthened by 427,000 since 2010. • Asa Bennett: Five ways George Osborne can cut tax credits without making workers worse off I have proposed to the Government that it reforms the Low Pay Commission. The Commission knows that one in four low paid employees are working in industries we usually wouldn’t associate with low wages, such as finance and banking, and high-end manufacturing. The Chancellor’s first move in the Budget, therefore, should be to task the Low Pay Commission with identifying those industries that can afford to implement the Living Wage without costing jobs, and asking them immediately to pay the Living Wage as a minimum hourly rate for all directly employed, agency and outsourced staff. Do you think the minimum wage should be raised? To help the remaining three quarters of low paid, the Chancellor’s second task for a reformed Low Pay Commission should be to draw up a five year plan, backed for that time with cuts in employers’ National Insurance contributions, so that a route map is drawn up to achieve a Living Wage in firms by the end of this Parliament. This two-pronged sectorial approach offers the Chancellor a practical solution to two of the key economic issues of this parliament – low productivity and low pay. Wednesday’s Budget could therefore open the next stage of tackling welfare dependency amongst employers and landlords in a manner that doesn’t punish today’s low paid workers. It also puts a cap on the welfare budget to be delivered by the end of this Parliament.
