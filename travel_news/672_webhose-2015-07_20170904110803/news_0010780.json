Very nice. I’m sure you’ll agree.’\nAfter no responses and nine tweets, he posted again: ‘Does anyone there care to comment on this disgusting message on my hotel TV? I can’t express how disappointed I am.’\nA Premier Inn employee responded the following day, writing: ‘Oh dear Phil! So sorry about this. Have you spoke to a team member at all?’\n Are school holidays a blessing or a burden? Survey reveals... The hotel from hell? Horror of businessman who checked into... Photographs that make a splash! Incredible images capture... Bride-to-be's disgust at Thomas Cook after her mother dies... Mr Burke explained that he reported the message to a staff member at the three-star hotel’s reception desk, but ‘there was little he could do’.\nHe added: ‘How on earth can you allow this to happen in the first place? I'm absolutely disgusted’.\nResponding via Twitter, an employee apologised and said an investigation would take place to determine how the message wound up on his TV screen.\nPremier Inn says a 'full investigation' is underway after the incident at its Dartford location (pictured)\nAfter he was asked how the rest of his stay went, Mr Burke blasted the hotel chain: ‘My stay was awful. Scaffolding outside my window and a nice view of a pylon, uncomfortable bed and my starter and main meal did not come as advertised.\n‘Possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. Awful experience’.\nYet he has drawn criticism for his outburst, with one Twitter user telling him: ‘It’s a Premier Inn not the Dorchester.’\nA Premier Inn spokeswoman said: ‘We take all complaints very seriously and a full investigation into how this occurred is underway.\n‘We apologise for any offence caused and Mr Burke's stay has now been refunded.\n‘We are pleased that he has also accepted our offer of a complimentary overnight stay at one of our hotels in the UK.’\nMailOnline Travel has contacted Mr Burke for comment.\nMeanwhile, a businessman claims the towels and bed sheets in his £100 room at a Premier Inn had not been changed following the departure of the previous guest.\nLee Green, 29, said he was confronted with a bed that had just been slept in, litter and damp towels at the Bricket Wood hotel, in St Albans, Hertfordshire.\nThe sales manager, from Gosport, Hampshire, claims that there was just one member of staff on shift who told him that there were no cleaners working and no spare rooms so he would have to sleep in the used bed.\nA Premier Inn spokesperson said its housekeeping staff go through ‘extensive training’ and ‘experiences such as these are extremely rare’.\nMr Green’s stay was refunded and he was offered a free overnight stay and breakfast at any Premier Inn hotel in the UK.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1SQLray"], "published": "2015-07-31T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T16:19:42.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
