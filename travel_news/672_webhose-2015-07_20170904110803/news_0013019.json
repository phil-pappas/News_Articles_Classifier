China shares tumbled early Friday, even as Beijing moves swiftly to try to plug losses, after three volatile weeks of trade has left markets sharply lower than highs reached in June.\nThe Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -4.61% , down 6.7%, has lost more than a quarter of its value since June 12. The smaller Shenzhen market 399106, -5.35% fell 6.8% while the ChiNext board 399006, -4.39% , composed of small-cap stocks, fell 6.9%. Both are down more than a third from peaks last month.\nLate Thursday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said it would launch an investigation into suspected manipulation of shares and futures.\nChinese officials over the past week have dug deep for measures to stop the massive sell-offs. Still, those moves — from several measures to lift restrictions on investing with borrowed funds to interest rate cuts — so far have failed to encourage investors to buy, even though China’s main stock index has nearly doubled since last year.\n“Despite indirect central government intervention … plus direct intervention in form of the [People’s Bank of China] rate cuts, Chinese markets are still falling,” analysts from brokerage IG wrote in a research note.\nThe guidelines announced Wednesday to ease restrictions on so-called margin lending — which include letting investors put up their homes for collateral to borrow — struck many as a turnaround, given regulators’ caution about risks of the practice in recent months. The amplified returns that come when investors borrow several times the amount of money they put in added steam to China’s rally over the past year. But margin lending also magnifies losses when investors are forced to stump up cash to repay brokers as shares slide.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.37% fell 0.8%, while a gauge of Hong Kong listings of Chinese companies HSCEI, -1.12% known as H-shares, fell 1.8%.\nElsewhere in Asia, markets are mostly down in early trade Friday, as the outcome of Greece’s bailout terms looks uncertain and economic data from the U.S. failed to buoy sentiment.\nGreece will hold a referendum on Sunday to determine the country’s bailout terms, which could determine whether the country stays in the eurozone. In the U.S. a slightly weaker-than-expected jobs report affirmed the belief that the Federal Reserve would be patient in raising interest rates. Still, investors are getting skittish as the weekend approaches, with stocks in the U.S. and Europe ending lower. The euro EURUSD, +0.0631% was flat against the U.S. dollar at $1.1088.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average NIK, -0.44% was down 0.4% in early trading, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -1.75% slipped 1.6%. South Korea’s Kospi Composite SEU, -0.57% is down 0.6%. The U.S. dollar, which initially weakened against the Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.01% after the tepid jobs data, is currently flat at ¥122.95.\n“Heading into a critical weekend in Europe, where a Greek referendum on whether or not to accept conditions for another bailout is slated for Sunday, investors will be loath to make any major moves, especially in light of the unimpressive U.S. jobs numbers and the dollar’s fall,” says Daiwa Securities. “Japan’s economic fundamentals are not looking bad, but the external factors overseas are taking precedent at the moment.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T06:02:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
