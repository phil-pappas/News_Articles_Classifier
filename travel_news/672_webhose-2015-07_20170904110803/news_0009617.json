I do not want to offend them. And all these tourists, it is for Thailand!” \nBangkok’s ruling generals have been busy courting Beijing as they build new diplomatic allies after last year’s coup was widely condemned by western nations. \nLast year, the two Asian nations forged new agricultural ties, and Beijing was also granted a major railway contract to construct two new lines criss-crossing Thailand. \nWith the recent easing of visa rules between the kingdom and China, where the growing ranks of the middle-classes are increasingly holidaying abroad, even more Chinese tourists are expected to arrive in Thailand this year. \nUnsurprisingly, Thai authorities appear keen to downplay any incidents of strife. \n“Chinese tourists do not create problems for us. They are nice tourists,” said Srisuda Wanapinyosak, an executive director at the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \n“But sometimes there might be cultural misunderstandings,” she admitted. \nBack at the White Temple, Cai Zheng Hua and his wife from the south-eastern province of Fujian in China, are enjoying their honeymoon. \nHe says that while some of his compatriots may “not have enough education to know how to behave”, they are very much in a “small minority”. \nFor most visitors Thailand is a “dream” and “very fashionable”, said Mr Cai, raving about the architecture at the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:22:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
