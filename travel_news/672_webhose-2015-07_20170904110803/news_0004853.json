We scour the Internet looking for \"top ten\" destinations, dream of exotic getaways, and gush over natural wonders in distant lands. We simply forget how majestic Canada itself truly is. From the glistening waters of Lake Moraine to the grandiose Rocky Mountains, we live in a country of National Parks that are home to some of the world's most breathtaking sights and natural beauty. \nThis summer, Air Wick ® is celebrating our glorious nation by reconnecting Canadians back to the majestic wonder of our National Parks. Through a new summer campaign and a specially crafted Canadian Parks Series ™ fragrance collection, Air Wick ® is rallying Canadians to pledge a moment each day to reflect on the beauty of our country. \nTo support travel to Canadian National Parks, Air Wick ® has partnered with Parks Canada to launch the #MomentOfCanada contest. When pledging via their branded #MomentOfCanada Facebook tab , consumers are entered for a chance to win a VIP trip to a Canadian National Park of their choice. Secondary prizes that encourage Canadians to get outdoors will also be available. \nTo further celebrate our country, Air Wick ® has crafted a limited edition Canadian Parks Series™ fragrance collection. This collection contains three unique scents, capturing the rare essence of Jasper , Banff , and Cape Breton Highlands, to help Canadians reconnect with the rejuvenating nature of their National Parks, even in the comfort of their home. \n\"Canadians forget how beautiful our country really is. Experiencing it at home is one way to reconnect to its majestic beauty. With the #MomentOfCanada campaign, we're asking our consumers to pledge a moment each day to reflect on the breathtaking nature found in our own country,\" states Indresh Kohli , Air Wick ® Category Director. \nTo take the Moment of Canada pledge, visit Facebook.com/AirWick For more information, visit www.airwick.ca Contest ends August 9 th , 2015. \nABOUT AIR WICK CANADA Everyone has a unique scent story – including Air Wick®.
