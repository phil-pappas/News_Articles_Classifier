Just don’t get too excited when the speed-limit sign says “100” — that’s kilometers per hour, not miles. Conversely, a $100 Canadian hotel bill is only about $85 American. \nAlmost directly across the lake from Cleveland are the pretty lakeside towns of Port Stanley and Erieau on either side of Rondeau Provincial Park. \nThe first thing that visitors see upon reaching the center of town at Port Stanley is a giant fiberglass lake perch, about the size that Paul Bunyan would have fished for had he strode over from Minnesota. The playful sculpture reflects the importance of sport and commercial fishing in the region. \nPort Stanley has a large beach park for lake lovers and a cute downtown with several inns, restaurants and tourist-friendly shops, many in pretty, historic buildings. When I visited, a large beach volleyball tournament was underway at the park despite a steady downpour of summer rain. Canadians, like Ohioans, are used to rolling with the climatological punches. \nPort Stanley is located at the mouth of Kettle Creek, which forms a natural harbor. A drawbridge across the creek allows pleasure boats to travel from the lake to the town’s marina. \nThe Port Stanley Terminal Rail scenic railroad runs regular trips from the historic train station near the bridge through the Canadian countryside to St. Thomas. I didn’t have time to make the one-hour run, but a friendly volunteer let me peek inside a historic engine and a dining car before the day’s first trip. \nThe town is also home to the lovely Port Stanley Festival Theatre, which offers live dramatic performances throughout the summer. \nRondeau Provincial Park is located about 30 miles west of Port Stanley on a large spit of land called Pointe aux Pins. The natural peninsula juts into the lake to form the eastern shore of Rondeau Bay. \nEstablished in 1894, the park has long been a favorite summer destination for Canadians. Some of the more than 200 summer cottages located within the park date to the 1920s and have been occupied by the same families for years under long-term leases. The park also has a large campground with more than 300 campsites, each within short walking distance of hiking and beach-access trails. \nThe sometimes rocky beach stretches for several miles along both sides of the peninsula. The wind is often strong; hundreds of wind turbines are located just inland from the park. The strong winds and wave action scour the rocky beach on the lake side of the peninsula, creating scenes of desolate beauty. \nThe calmer, bay-side shoreline of the park offers good fishing and boating access. The 1-mile Marsh Trail boardwalk also stretches along Rondeau Bay to an observation tower that offers great views of the bay and lake. \nRondeau is one of the southernmost parks in Canada. Sure, “south” is relative in Canada. But the location has given the park an unusual ecological diversity, with ecosystems including freshwater dune, black-oak savannah and Carolinian forest that harbor a large number of plant and animal species. \nBird-watchers will find an amazing variety, especially during spring and fall migrations. More than 80 percent of all bird species ever observed in the huge province of Ontario have been seen at Rondeau. \nJust to the west of Rondeau Bay is the tiny lakefront town of Erieau. The long, narrow slip of a town takes up most of a small peninsula forming the western edge of Rondeau Bay. Businesses, including shops, motels and a newly opened craft brewery, line a tree-filled boulevard running down the peninsula between the bay and the lake. \nBayside Brewing is in a historic house that has been home to several restaurants through the years. Now, it’s a great place to indulge in a wide variety of beers brewed onsite, as well as local wines and food such as burgers and Lake Erie perch. The brewery even has its own small dock for boaters who want to proceed directly from water to beer. \nA long breakwater divides the bay from the lake at Erieau. At the end, an old steel lighthouse built in 1912 sits covered in graffiti but is still picturesque. From the lake side of the wall, a long expanse of beach stretches west along the Erieau Peninsula. \nFrom here, it’s just a 60-mile swim from Cleveland. A better choice would be a boat, or the 125-mile drive from Toledo. A ferry also runs between Sandusky and the Canadian town of Leamington with a stop at Pelee Island. \nHowever you get there, though, you’re likely to enjoy the Canadian side of Ohio’s great lake. \nIF YOU GO Lake Erie’s north shore The central region of the Canadian side of the Lake Erie shore, directly across the lake from Cleveland, offers visitors a different and interesting perspective on the North Coast. GETTING THERE From Columbus, the drive through Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, to Rondeau Provincial Park takes about five hours. The province of Ontario also operates a ferry between Leamington or Kingsville on the Canadian side and Sandusky, with a stop at Pelee Island.
