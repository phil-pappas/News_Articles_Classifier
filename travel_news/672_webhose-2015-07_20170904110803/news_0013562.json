Quick Facts \n• Halifax Citadel National Historic site gives visitors a place where the sounds of a modern, bustling port city are exchanged for the crack of rifle-fire and the skirl of bagpipes. The present Citadel was completed in 1856 and is the fourth in a series of British forts on this site. Today, the restored Citadel is a national landmark, commemorating Halifax's role as a key naval station in the British Empire and for its role in the progress of colony to nation. The current site is renowned for bringing history to life in Atlantic Canada's largest urban center. \n• Between the two of them, Halifax Citadel and York Redoubt National Historic Sites welcome nearly 500,000 visitors every year. Last year, more than 21 million visits were made to Canada's national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas. \n• Parks Canada is present in hundreds of communities across Canada and contributes approximately $3 billion dollars to the Canadian economy every year. Parks Canada's overall contribution to the Canadian economy is responsible for more than 40,000 jobs from coast to coast to coast.
