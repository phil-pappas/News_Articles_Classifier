This is untamed Africa, where wildebeest, shadowed by zebras, stampede in their millions across the earth, where lions, leopards and cheetahs, hyenas and wild dogs roam free in search of their next meal. Chimpanzees and the powerful yet silent silverback male gorillas and their families withdraw into remote islands of forests. Such stirring scenes of life and death, such overwhelming images of abundance coexist with evidence of surprising fragility. To draw near to this wildness is to experience something so profound that it will live forever in your memory.\nEnthralling landscapes\nThis is the land of the Masai Mara and the Serengeti, of an immense red sun setting behind a flat-topped acacia. Here on the African savanna, the world remains unspoilt by human presence. Nearby, rising from the Rift Valley floor are Mt Kilimanjaro, the Ngorongoro Crater, the Crater Highlands, Mt Meru, Mt Kenya and the Rwenzoris. By climbing these peaks on foot and scaling the Rift, you add your own footprints to Africa’s marvellous human story and explore in ways unimaginable to those who never leave their vehicles.\nSEVEN PLACES STILL CHEAP FOR OVERSEAS HOLIDAYS\nUNESCO WORLD HERITAGE SITES IN DANGER\nTribal cultures\nA Masai Warrior stands near an Acacia tree and surveying landscape of Lewa Conservancy in Kenya. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nEast Africa has a rich mosaic of tribal cultures, with mroe than 300 different groups in an area roughly one quarter of the size of Australia. Their traditions are expressed through splendid ceremonial attire, pulsating dance rhythms, refined artistry and highly organised community structures, and experiencing these will likely be a highlight of your travels.\nBeaches and islands\nEast Africa’s coastline is utterly gorgeous and there are some near-perfect beaches, including some with stunning, remote stretches of sand that have yet to be discovered. The islands of East Africa’s Indian Ocean coastline capture the essence of the region’s appeal. For an utterly different experience, Lake Turkana and Lake Rubondo are remote and rarely visited.\nWhy I love East Africa\n“East Africa is where my love affair with Africa took hold and promised never to let go. Wildlife (big cats especially) and wilderness rank among the grand passions of my life and it was here that I saw my first lion on the march, my first cheetah on the hunt, my first leopard on a kill, where I came so close to elephants and black rhinos that I could have reached out and touched them. And this is the home of Maasai friends who give me hope that the old ways can survive.” - Anthony Ham, coordinating author of Lonely Planet East Africa (10th Edition), published this month.\nTOP FIVE EAST AFRICAN HIGHLIGHTS\n1. Wildebeest migration (Kenya and Tanzania)\nWelcome to one of the greatest shows on earth. The pounding hoofs draw closer, and then, suddenly, thousands of wildebeest stampede by, sweeping across the plains of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (from October to July) and the Masai Mara in Kenya (from July to October). Wherever you catch up with them, you’ll find up to a million of these ungainly animals along with herds of zebras, elephants and giraffes. With predators never far away, this is natural drama on an epic scale. A female mountain gorilla carries her baby in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. Picture: Lonely Planet Source: Supplied\n2. Gorilla tracking, Volcanoes National Park (Rwanda)\nNothing can really prepare you for that first moment when you find yourself in the midst of a family of mountain gorillas. It’s an utterly humbling experience, sharing the forest with the silverback, whose sheer size and presence will leave you in awe, or with adorable fuzzy babies clowning about and tumbling from trees. The term ‘once in a lifetime’ is bandied about a lot, but gorilla tracking in Volcanoes National Park is one experience for which it just happens to be true.\n3. Mt Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)\nIt’s difficult to resist the allure of climbing Africa’s highest peak, one of the Holy Grails of East African travel, with its snow-capped summit, views over the surrounding plains and otherworldly gravitas. If you can’t make the summit, there are other rewarding ways to experience the mountain. Day-hike on the lush lower slopes, spend time learning about local Chagga culture or sip a sundowner from a nearby vantage point with the mountain as a backdrop.\n4. Masai big cats, Masai Mara (Kenya) Lions look out over Paradise Plain in Masai Mara. Picture: Lonely Planet Source: Supplied\nStudded with flat-top acacia trees, the rolling savannas of the Masai Mara National Reserve support some of the highest concentrations of wildlife on the planet. The great herds of wildebeest may bring sound and movement to the plains, but it’s the big cats — the Marsh Pride of lions, lords of their domain, the leopards lurking in riverine thickets and the cheetahs surveying the world from a termite mound before exploding into a chase — who are the Mara’s most soulful inhabitants.\n5. Stone Town, Zanzibar (Tanzania)\nZanzibar’s Stone Town never loses its atmosphere of exoticism. First you’ll see the skyline, with the spires of St Joseph’s Cathedral and the Old Fort. Then, wander through narrow alleyways that reveal surprises at every turn. Linger at shops scented with cloves, watch men wearing kanzu (white robe-like outer garment) play bao (game), and admire intricate henna designs on the hands of women in their bui-bui (black coverall). Island rhythms quickly take over as mainland life slips away.\nNEED TO KNOW\nWhen to go\nHigh season (June-August)\n• Much of the region is cool and dry.\n• Hotels in popular areas are full, many with high-season prices.\n• Animal-spotting is easiest, as foliage is sparse and animals congregate around water sources.\nShoulder (Sep-Feb)\n• An ideal travel time, with greener landscapes and fewer crowds.\n• Peak-season prices from mid-December to mid-January.\n• Short rains in October and November rarely interrupt travel.\nLow season (March-May)\n• Heavy rains in much of the region make secondary roads muddy, some areas inaccessible and landscapes green.\n• Some hotels close; others offer low-season discounts.\nDaily costs\nMid-range: US$50 — US$200\n• Double room in mid-range hotel: US$50-US$200\n• Meal in Western-style restaurant: US$10-US$20\n• Nairobi — Arusha shuttle bus: US$25-US$35\nThis is an edited extract from Lonely Planet East Africa (10th Edition) by Anthony Ham, et al. © Lonely Planet 2015.
