Showman’s Show 2015 - Have you Seenit? Details Category: Show Created   15:30 The Showman’s Show will be working with innovative video app provider Seenit to produce exciting and dynamic footage of the Show when it returns to Newbury Showground this October. As a collaborative platform that effectively turns the event’s key stakeholders into a mobile film crew, organiser Lance Show & Publications Limited will be encouraging visitors, exhibitors, journalists and industry experts to get involved. \nThe app allows the selected ‘film crew’ to co-create video via their smartphones detailing tasks, along with interviewer questions alongside simple to follow instructions on how to upload the video. The content arrives to a central private online studio where films can be quickly edited and then distributed out to social media channels. Organiser Johnny Lance of Lance Show & Publications Limited comments: “The use of technology and social media is undoubtedly on the rise and embracing an app like Seenit’s is a great way to incorporate both elements into the Show and have a bit of fun at the same time. I’ve been aware of Seenit for a while and I think they have the perfect platform for what we’re trying to achieve. What could be better than empowering and engaging with the people who are most passionate about the event and asking them to become content creators for us?” Seenit’s impressive client roster includes STA Travel, Bacardi, Bauer Media, Unilever, Camelot and Manchester City Football Club. They have also recently worked with BBC Worldwide on the launch of BBC Earth Capture, an initiative to capture moments from the natural world by fans who are invited to upload and share their short films of the world around them, related to themes chosen by the BBC Earth Capture team. The Showman’s Show 2015 will take place at the Newbury Showground from October 21st – 22nd.
