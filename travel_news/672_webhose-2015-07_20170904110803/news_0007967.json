But it is possible to make your iPhone battery charge last that bit longer by applying just a few simple hacks: 1. Lighting the pixels on your screen takes up a lot of energy so make your first move to turn down the brightness. Then look at your settings and make sure that auto-brightness is switched off so your phone doesn't crank it back up again. 2. One of the biggest drains of battery life is your phone’s antenna, which is constantly checking for nearby cellular and Wi-Fi networks. If you don’t need to access data, turn Wi-Fi off while you’re not actually using it. 3. If you know there’s no phone signal where you are, set it to Airplane mode which stops it looking for a signal. Otherwise, the iPhone will be working extra hard to find one at the expense of your battery. 4. If your phone is running on fumes set it to periodically Fetch rather than Push email as soon as it arrives on the server. Push constantly polls the server so when you get a new email the iPhone knows instantly – but that takes power. 5. To improve battery time generally you should stop all unnecessary Push notifications. Go to Settings –> Notification Center to turn off any notifications you don’t actually need. 6. If you're not using Bluetooth to connect to a speaker, headphones, or other accessory switch it off. 7. Close all of your apps so they stop running in the background by double-tapping your home button, and swiping up on each of them. 8. If you have iOS7 there’s an option to have dynamic wallpaper that's interactive all day. But it’s also draining your battery all day so take it off. 9. Switch the flash off on your phone’s camera and avoid using photo apps until you’ve had chance to recharge. 10. And when you do get your hands on a charger switch flight mode back on – your battery will replenish more quickly if you do. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:55:06.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
