Cooper says they reported a fire in the No. 2 engine but said they shut the engine down and put out the blaze with the cold air.\nFire crews stood by when the plane landed, but they were not needed.\nDelta spokesman Morgan Durrant says the problem appeared to be an engine surge, which is rare. When the surge happens, the air and fuel mixture in the engine produces a flame that shoots out the back. The flight crew followed procedures and throttled back the engine and landed at the nearest airport, which was Seattle.\nDurrant says the 255 passengers who had been headed to Atlanta were rescheduled on flights Thursday morning.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:09:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
