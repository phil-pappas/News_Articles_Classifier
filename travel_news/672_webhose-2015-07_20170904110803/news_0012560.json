The Honest Company , a consumer goods brand, recently started installing automated kiosks stocked with essentials for parents who forgot to bring diapers onto their next flight. The eco-friendly line, founded by the actress Jessica Alba in 2012, has set up nine kiosks at several airports and already plans more.\nThis initiative is part of a larger move to cater to traveling families with young children. In May, the household and baby care line Seventh Generation introduced breast-feeding pods at the New York area airports La Guardia and Newark Liberty International. For its part, Boston’s Logan International Airport, like several other airports around the country, has an indoor playground with slides and a kids-size replica of its control tower.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
