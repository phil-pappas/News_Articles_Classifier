I have never seen anything like this in New Zealand,” marine mammal scientist Carlos Olavarria said in a DOC statement.\nSurvey Leader Nadine Bott said distinctive features on the whale like those on Migaloo, Australian Aboriginal for “white fellow,” strongly indicated it was the same whale.\nA skin sample for DNA analysis was taken from the white whale on Sunday with a biopsy and would be compared with Migaloo’s DNA to confirm whether it was definitely the same whale.\nThe analysis would also identify whether the whale was albino or whether its whiteness was due to color variation.\n“White humpbacks are extremely rare. Only four have been reported in the world,” Bott said in the statement.\n“Migaloo is the most famous and another white humpback whale was spotted in Norway this year. Migaloo is thought to have fathered two white calves which have been making appearances along Australia’s eastern coast. One has been named MJ, short for Migaloo junior.”\nThe annual whale survey assesses humpback whale recovery since commercial whaling ended in 1964 and is timed for humpback whales’ northern migration to South Pacific breeding grounds.\nThe survey this year had a very high count of 122 humpback whales, surpassing its previous highest of tally of 106 in 2012.\nRelated Posts Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit Hiking Through Paradise Tourism 2025 – promising start but much more to do Queenstown voted top destination in New Zealand and the South Pacific New Zealand gearing up for a summer full of cricket", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:40:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
