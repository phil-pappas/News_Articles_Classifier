A Thomas Cook Airlines jet took off from Manchester to bring home more than 200 passengers after the Foreign Secretary placed the country on its “no-go” list.\nThe warning places Tunisia in the same category as Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia.\nTwo weeks ago 30 British tourists were among the 38 people murdered by an Islamist gunman on the beach. A Tunisian student, Seifeddine Rezgui, opened fire on tourists on sun-loungers at a luxury hotel just north of the resort of Sousse.\nIn the past two weeks the Tunisian authorities have failed to convince the Foreign Office that it can contain a multiplicity of threats, many emanating from across the long, leaky border with Libya.\n\nThe new travel advice says: “Although we have had good co-operation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.\n“On balance, we do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time.”\nThe Foreign Office is warning against all but essential travel for the majority of Tunisia \nCoaches carrying the holidaymakers are being given an armed military escort to Enfidha airport, which is itself heavily protected following the two attacks on tourists this year; in March the Bardo Museum in the capital, Tunis, was the scene of another massacre.\nThe first few planes will fly to Manchester, Gatwick and East Midlands, with coach connections provided for travellers who were originally booked to other airports.\nThe holidaymakers who died on the beach were travelling with Thomson and its all-inclusive brand, First Choice. Following the attack, Thomson flew home all its customers. Immediately after the Foreign Office announcement, the company said: “We have taken the decision to repatriate all British Thomson and First Choice staff currently working in Tunisia within the next 24 hours.”\nThomas Cook is now the leading tour operator to Tunisia; at the time of the announcement, it had around 2,000 holidaymakers in the country. The company said: “Thomas Cook's next departures for Tunisia from the UK were due to take place on Saturday and have been cancelled following the advice from the FCO.\nIn pictures: Tunisia hotel attack \n“Those who are returning home from Tunisia earlier than planned will receive a refund for the days they have missed from their holiday.”\nAnyone with a package holiday booked to Tunisia up to the end of October is now entitled to choose between a refund or alternative holiday. Tour operators are switching capacity from Tunisia to Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria and Turkey.\nAbta, the travel association, said: “Those people with bookings beyond the summer are advised to wait until closer to the departure date to contact their travel company as the situation is fluid.”\nIndependent travellers are being urged to make their own arrangements, which are likely to involve scheduled flights from Tunis airport. Anyone who chooses to stay against the new advice will find their travel insurance is invalid, though policies will stay in effect for travellers who are endeavouring to find a way to leave the country.\nTunisia’s ambassador to the UK, Nabil Ammar, told BBC Newsnight that the decision plays into the hands of terrorists: “By damaging the tourism, by having foreigners leaving the country, they damage the whole sector and put so many people out of work and on the streets.\n“One of the sources of terrorism is lack of hope.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:34:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
