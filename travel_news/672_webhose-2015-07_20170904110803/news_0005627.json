In the Eighties, Labour fought tooth and nail against union reforms, yet never repealed one single law when they were in office for 13 years. Similarly, Labour opposed the privatisation of large swathes of British industry that they themselves had nationalised. Not one has been returned to the public sector. Now, after denouncing the Conservatives as heartless for proposing cuts in welfare spending, Harriet Harman, the party’s acting leader , conceded that Labour might support some of them after all. The Opposition is now backing Tory plans to limit child tax credits and is prepared to embrace the new £20,000 ceiling on total benefits. Miss Harman said one lesson Labour had taken from its defeat in May was not to engage in “blanket opposition” and to be “understanding” of the reason for changes. But while the repenting sinner is always joyfully welcomed back, the reasons offered by Labour for this volte-face indicate that their calculations are very possibly purely electoral and the party does not really believe in a smaller state. A large number of the new Labour MPs are staunchly Left-wing, and the strong backing Jeremy Corbyn , the Left’s candidate in the leadership election, is receiving from activists does suggest that Miss Harman may have some trouble convincing many of her colleagues to be quite so “understanding” about the need for cuts.
