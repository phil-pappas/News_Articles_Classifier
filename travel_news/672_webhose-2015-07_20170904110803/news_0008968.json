This is the best April performance since 2012.\nThese figures are a significant improvement on last year, which dipped due to the severe weather conditions and flooding at the beginning of the year. VisitEngland’s latest Tourism Business Monitor supports the findings of this month’s GBTS. Nearly half of accommodation providers and 56% of attractions have reported experiencing an increase in visitors for the year to May. Looking ahead, over nine in ten of the businesses surveyed remain confident about the school summer holiday period. This is particularly true amongst accommodation providers who’ve reported high numbers of advanced bookings.\nThe early months of the year were characterised by above average weather and a number of high profile anniversaries including the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta and the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill and events including the first ever ‘Tour de Yorkshire’ in May, hundreds of family friendly Easter activities across the country in April and a host of music, food and walking festivals, all contributing to high levels of confidence amongst businesses. The industry also celebrated all that’s great about tourism in England with English Tourism Week which took place from 14 – 22 March.\nSource:- Visit England", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:12:46.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
