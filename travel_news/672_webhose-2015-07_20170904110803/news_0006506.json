Those wanting to take advantage of the generous offer simply have to know how to work the website in order to bag their tickets.\nAs with most things that come with Ryanair, there are a few catches.\nFor example, London Stansted is one of their biggest departure airports and has a veritable smorgasbord of European destinations. Because there are a limited number of flights, you may have to compromise when it comes to a) where you go and b) where you fly from.\nThe flights only count from between this September and the end of January 2016, so before you get any ideas of a last minute Summer holiday, be warned you may be disappointed.\nAlso remember to take caution when you use the site, as the amazing deals mean that site usuage is at an all-time high and may be prone to crashing, like when people flood festival ticket sites.\nStill want to bag yourself a cheap getway?\nHere’s what you need to do: 1) Go to the Ryanair website and click on the big picture on the front of the site and click on SALE.\n\n2) Go to the custom sliders at the side and slide on down to the £20 marker\n\n3) Choose your ideal departure airline (prepare to maybe travel to a different one than your usual airport)\n\n4) Bask in the glory of cheap flights and the promise of adventure", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:58:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
