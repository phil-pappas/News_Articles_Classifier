The game ended as it started, in silence with players arm-in-arm.\nThe Crows can hold their heads high just for getting in the head space for a contest and still having a sniff starting the final term 29 points down.\nSlick runner Riley Knight (two) will always cherish his first goal on debut in a third term rally. Scott Camporeale held firm on debut as head coach in an unprecedented night of football heartache, occupying Walsh’s old seat.\nGallant Adelaide had spent a lifetime of emotion, leading by 14 points at quarter time in a contest West Coast would run away with.\nThe Eagles were supercharged by ruckman Nic Naitanui and midfielders Andrew Gaff (three and 36 touches) and Chris Masten (35). Luke Shuey celebrated 100 games with two goals.\nCrows press conference with interim coach Scott Camporeale 7:33 Play video\nAFL: Adelaide Crows interim coach Scott Camporeale talks to the media following his side's loss to the West Coast Eagles.\nFox Sports 11 Jul 2015 Sport/AFL/News Mark Le Cras, Elliott Yeo, Jack Darling, Gaff, Josh Kennedy, Scott Selwood, Sharrod Wellingham and Josh Hill combined to boot eight unanswered goals in a devastating, Eagles second-term riposte.\nAdelaide floundered with brilliant but hurt Patrick Dangerfield off the field until the 13th minute of the second term but nothing was going to hold back a West Coast tsunami.\nTom Lynch was eventually used a defensive spare but the damage was done.\nDangerfield had a tooth knocked out and mouth badly split. The clutch onballer’s absence emphasised the importance of a 13-possession first term complete with eight contested possessions.\nA 54-point turnaround iced the contest before the main break — with Adelaide paying dearly for 33 turnovers.\nWalsh brought the forward press to West Coast with dramatic effect in its 2011 surge to a preliminary final. Now Adam Simpson’s ensemble have taken it to another level, stunning the competition with a rise to second despite injuries to key defenders Mitch Brown and Eric Mackenzie.\nThe Eagles are exceptional at locking the ball in their forward half, forcing turnovers and stoppages and scoring off the back as Gaff and Yeo proved.\nAdelaide still deserved credit for a resolute first term after West Coast jumped to a three-goal start.\nFive of Adelaide’s first six goals would come from discerning chips over the defence as the Crows became the first interstate side to briefly threaten West Coast press strategy\nCharlie Cameron — triggered Adelaide surge. Picture: Mark Brake Source: News Corp Australia\nCharlie Cameron (two) triggered Adelaide’s exploitation of the West Coast press as the Crows slotted five straight goals. Cameron had a hand in Adelaide’s third, offloading to Josh Jenkins who the selflessly allowed Taylor Walker to enjoy an open goal.\nThis was Phil Walsh’s team-first footy.\nUltimately, West Coast’s sheer line-by-line superiority would prevail.\nThe Eagles have crushed opposition in all key hallmarks this season and did last night winning clearances (22-13) inside 50s 73-37.\nHowever Adelaide led the Eagles for tackles (57-51) and led Walsh’s pet ground ball get category 54-48.\nDaniel Talia can be consoled with a blanket job on Josh Kennedy while Matt Crouch showed glimpses of star quality.\nWEST COAST 4.0 12.7 15.10 22.15 (147)\nADELAIDE 6.2 6.3 11.5 4.7 (91)\nGOALS — West Coast: Gaff (3) Yeo (3), Le Cras (2) Darling (2), Shuey (2), Hill (2) Kennedy (2) Priddis, Wellingham, Selwood, Sheed, Masten, Naitanui\nAdelaide: Walker (3), Cameron (2), Betts (2) Knight (2) Jenkins (2) Wright, Lynch, Smith\nBEST — West Coast: Naitanui, Gaff, Le Cras, Masten, Rosa, Priddis.
