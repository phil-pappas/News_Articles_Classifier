The Langham, London, answers that question with the debut of its Sterling Suite —a 4,843-square foot penthouse unveiled as part of the hotel’s 150th anniversary renovation. Designed by the English hospitality firm Richmond, the lavish lodgings can accommodate up to 12 guests. A private lift gives guests secluded access to the suite, ensuring absolute privacy during their stay. \nThe lobby area leads to two bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, stand-alone bathtubs, and dressing rooms. Other standout features include a spacious drawing room with a piano, a bespoke fireplace, and a bar; a home-theater lounge with a large flat-screen television and a long, L -shaped couch; and a master bedroom with a dressing room that features hand-painted chinoiserie on silver-leaf panels and verre églomisé glass with Gilded Age details. Decorated with hand-painted furniture, handblown Murano-glass light fixtures, bespoke furnishings, and antique mirrors, the spacious suite offers unrivaled opulence and comfort. Guests can request round-the-clock butler service, free newspapers and magazines, complimentary private bar service, and access to the Health Club and Wellness Centre and the new Langham Club Lounge. \nThe hotel’s history is almost as grandiose as its decor and amenities: The Langham, London, was opened in 1864 by the Prince of Wales, who later reigned as King Edward VII. The on-site Palm Court is rumored to be the birthplace of the afternoon-tea tradition. The Sterling Suite starts at around $37,000 per night—a suitably large pile of silver for the biggest suite in London.
