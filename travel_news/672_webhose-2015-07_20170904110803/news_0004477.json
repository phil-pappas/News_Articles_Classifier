Consumers are only going to find those [deals] in destinations that people are unsure about - like Turkey and Greece. \n“We’re still encouraging Turkey, Greece and Egypt. It’ll be a battle before we can send people back to Tunisia, but it will happen.” \nOthers suggested the market had altered so much that the lates market now barely existed. \nJohn Sullivan, head of commercial and marketing at The Advantage Travel Partnership, said: “In May and June… there was some really low pricing out there, but it was for the shoulder season. As we head into the peaks season, I don’t think the situation is any different to last year or the year before.” \nHe said the consortium’s members had been rebooking customers due to holiday in Tunisia to Bulgaria instead, as it has the best price parity. \nChris Bailey, owner of Baileys Travel in Northamptonshire, said the lates market was no longer able to operate in the usual way.“Any travel agent who is reliant on late bookings wants their head read and they want to move their business model to something more sustainable,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:13:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
