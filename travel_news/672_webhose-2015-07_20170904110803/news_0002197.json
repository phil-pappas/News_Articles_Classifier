Jesse Jackson visits Memory and History of Slavery museum in Guadeloupe Adv: Jesse Jacskon greeting Guadeloupeans at the Memorial ACTe Adv: \nNEW YORK, NY - During his five-day visit to the French Caribbean archipelago of Guadeloupe, American Civil rights leader and Baptist minister, Reverend Jesse Jackson, toured the \"MEMORIAL ACTe,\" the world's largest museum dedicated to the Memory and History of Slavery from the early seventeenth century to present day. \nAlready called the \"POMPIDOU CENTER\" or the \"MuCEM\" of the Caribbean for its impressive architecture and interactive content, Rev. Jackson's visit to the Memorial ACTe, comes just two months after the inauguration which was attended by French President François Hollande and 19 heads of States from Africa and the Caribbean. Rev. Jackson arrived on the main island of Guadeloupe on Saturday afternoon and received a warm welcome by the Guadeloupe Islands officials and residents. After his official visit to the Memorial ACTe, Rev. Jesse Jackson commented: \n\"This is the most phenomenal museum of its kind in the whole world. I have been to museums in numerous cities across the world, we are now building a significant one in Washington DC, but this is the most complete museum of ours in the world and this is not the last one. It is the signal we need more museums to tell us about our story.\" \nBy spearheading this project, the Guadeloupe Islands wanted to contribute to the building of a universal and shared memory of Slavery. The intent of the Memorial ACTe is to give voice to memory and to become a cultural and humanitarian beacon of light for the French Caribbean archipelago to the world. \n\"The Memorial Acte is the first of its kind—an interactive, educational, and thoughtful walk through history that provides the ultimate platform for the coming together and celebration of the culture and history of all people of the African Diaspora. It surely attracts tourists from throughout the world, visitors and people of all races and cultures. The new non-stop air service to the islands of Guadeloupe from the East Coast is just a perfect timing for Americans,\" said Gaynelle Henderson – CEO of Henderson Travel, No. 1 U.S. Tour Operator in Black history Tours. \nThanks to the \"Open Sky Treaty\" between the U.S and the E.U., the award-winning low-cost European airline Norwegian will connect the French Caribbean Guadeloupe Islands to three major East coast gateways. Service will start on Dec 3, 2015 and will operate as follows: \nTo and from Pointe-ā-Pitre (PTP), Guadeloupe. \n• New York (JFK) – Three times weekly on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays \n• Baltimore/Washington, D.C. (BWI) - Twice weekly on Tuesdays and Saturdays \n• Boston (BOS) - Twice weekly on Thursdays and Sundays \nCommenting on all these developments from her New York office, Sandra Venite, USA Regional Manager of the Guadeloupe Islands Tourism Board said: \"Since 2012 U.S arrivals have increased by 29%, building year after year as Americans discover our unspoiled and culturally rich destination. The affordable Norwegian airfare will attract more travelers in search of pristine natural settings, unpretentious atmosphere and cultural experiences. The Guadeloupe Islands have never been so accessible by air in 30 years and we are thrilled to give Americans the opportunity to tick our destination off their bucket list.\" Ms. Venite went on to say: \"And of course we also thrilled and very honored to have hosted the Reverend Jesse Jackson, an icon of the American civil rights movement, whose visit will certainly spur interest in the Memorial ACTe and the Guadeloupe Islands.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:11.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
