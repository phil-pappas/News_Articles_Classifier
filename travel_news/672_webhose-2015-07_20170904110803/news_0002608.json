She wants it to be a surprise for his birthday, but I think he should be aware that she made a large financial decision without him. I also do not want to mess up my relationship with my sister-in-law. Would it be bad to inform my brother even though she told me this in confidence?\nCarolyn Hax started her advice column in 1997, after five years as a copy editor and news editor in Style and none as a therapist. The column includes cartoons by \"relationship cartoonist\" Nick Galifianakis -- Carolyn's ex-husband -- and appears in over 200 newspapers. View Archive Facebook Google+ RSS Sister\nYes, it would be pretty terrible. The time to break a confidence is when doing so would prevent a harm greater than the betrayal itself.\nThe house is bought, so you can’t prevent the purchase, so your brother is getting surprised no matter what — so all you’d accomplish by meddling is to make yourself the messenger instead of your sister-in-law. I can’t think of any way that would help, but I can envision a bunch of ways it would cause havoc.\nEven if you did have standing or justification to get involved, which you don’t, it’s a bad idea to respond as if everyone would feel as you do. Your sister-in-law might have more insight than you do into what your brother wants.\nAny good reason to stay out of someone else’s mess is a gift — to them if not to you — and you have at least two of the better reasons I’ve seen not to touch this drama with oven mitts. Accept the gift.\nDear Carolyn:\nI recently started seeing a man in his late 50s who has been married seven times. His last relationship lasted a dozen years. Is there any hope with someone with this history?\nAnonymous\nYes, if you hope to be temporary. If you hope for a permanent relationship, then basic risk assessment says no.\nBut you don’t need me to read tea leaves for you.\nApparently you want this, and want to justify it as a rational choice, so you’re shopping for hopeful rationales. Since I’m all about customer service, here’s one for you: It’s okay to make choices that would mystify any sentient observer, as long as your expectations are based in his reality and not your wishful thinking.\nAnother caveat. If the allure for you here is the idea of becoming The One Person special enough to keep his attention, then I suggest finding other, more productive ways of challenging yourself. A triathlon perhaps. Calligraphy. A pie-eating contest. (For a cautionary tale, check out the Ruth-and-George arc in “Six Feet Under,” seasons 3 through 5.)\nDear Carolyn:\nI recently heard from the grapevine that a neighbor feels I am “standoffish.” This despite our having had them over numerous times for the first seven of the 20 years we’ve lived here. Not once were we invited over, even for a potluck. So I stopped inviting them.\nI am not sure how to respond to this neighbor, who I see at neighborhood events — ideas?\nAlways the Host, Never the Guest\nIf you miss their friendship, share with them what the grapevine said, and say you thought their not reciprocating meant they weren’t interested in your friendship. See what they say. Why not.\nIf you don’t miss their friendship, then do nothing. Fixing someone’s opinion of you, in itself, is a goal rarely worth your time.\n[Click here for Amy Dickinson’s take on this same question. ]\nWrite to Carolyn Hax , Style, 1150 15th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071, or tellme@washpost.com .
