In fact vulnerability and exposure have increased in the last decade in all the Caribbean territories due to a number of physical, social and economic factors,” delivered Dr. Stephen Ramroop, Chief Executive Officer, Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management of Trinidad and Tobago on behalf of Mr. Ronald Jackson, Executive Director, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) during the Opening Ceremony of a two day workshop convened at the Secretariat of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). \nThe Training Workshop on Seismic, Tsunami and Volcanic Risk is a collaborative event between the ACS and the Government of Chile which is aimed at comprehensively analyzing and explaining the kind of emergency management needed when faced with a volcanic eruption, with seismic and tsunami signs affecting the Caribbean; giving details on demarcating areas of impact and actions for prevention, preparedness and warning associated with these natural processes. \nH.E. Fernando Schmidt, Ambassador of Chile to Trinidad and Tobago inaugurated the event and emphasized that the workshop is part of a general framework of Chile’s solidarity with the Caribbean that has existed for decades and which has been refined over time. \nMr. Alberto Duran, Chargé d’Affaires and Director of Trade Development and External Economic Relations of the ACS, in his contributory remarks, acknowledged the negative impact of disasters on activities geared towards achieving sustainable development for the Greater Caribbean. He anticipated the workshop to be a revitalization of the vision of the Association for a stronger and more united Region. \nThe workshop covers the conceptual framework behind Seismic, Tsunami and Volcanic Risk, the impacts associated with each and also explored mechanisms for civil protection management systems including implantation of early warning and monitoring systems, risk planning, training and drills. \nMs. Margaret B. Diop, Chargé d’Affaires a.i., Embassy of the United States of America to Trinidad and Tobago attended the Opening Ceremony. Other participants include representatives from Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and the Embassy of Japan to Trinidad and Tobago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:24:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
