However, ARESEP in December postponed the measures until July.\nAyA in April filed a request to suspend the rate reduction until next year arguing that it would negate ₡16 billion ($30 million) in projected income for this year.\nFollowing Monday’s decision ARESEP’s water services manager, Carlos Herrera Amighetti, asked AyA to justify each rate change request starting now. Those requests must be based on the agency’s investment plan for the next five years and on goals set to meet customers’ needs.\nThe new rates only affect residents in the San José Greater Metropolitan Area who are serviced by AyA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T00:52:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
