A much larger, unmanned, four-seater airplane is another. You may not have heard about it, but a 4,100-pound twin-propeller experimental airplane called the Centaur was flight-tested this month at a Federal Aviation Administration-designated site in Rome, New York. The Centaur flew with no pilot in the cockpit, becoming the first large-scale fixed wing unmanned aircraft to fly at an FAA-approved test site, according to Aurora Flight Sciences Corp., which makes the Centaur. It represents an important new step toward airplanes without pilots in the cockpit being able to fly in the nation's commercial airspace. Currently, the FAA limits large unmanned planes to special military or civilian test zones. But the popularity of drones and other remote-controlled aircraft is prompting officials to write new regulations for this kind of emerging technology. Aurora calls Centaur an \"optionally piloted aircraft\" because it can be piloted in the cockpit or by remote control. When a pilot is operating it inside the cockpit, the aircraft is perfectly legal to fly around the U.S. like any other small passenger plane. It's marketed as a cheaper way for pipeline operators or mining companies to survey their property. But if CEO John Langford has his way, people will be riding in them too. \"I'm a huge believer that the unmanned airplane revolution will make aviation safer for everybody,\" he told CNN. \"That isn't to say there won't be accidents, but the overall level of safety will go up as the robotic stuff is introduced.\" For many Americans, the idea of 30-foot-long remote-controlled airplanes flying overhead might take some getting used to. @thompatterson @CNN Not to belabor the point, but I'd like to have the pilot have a vested interest in my safety. Like being on board. â€” Tim Farrell (@Tim_Farrell11) June 27, 2015 Best-case scenario, in five to seven years, Langford guesses we'll see planes like the Centaur operate under the same U.S. certification levels that manned airplanes currently do. Between now and then the FAA will have to develop new regulations for these remote-controlled planes. Engineers will have to perfect collision avoidance technology that will prevent crashes. \"There's kind of a race to do that now,\" he said. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker told a House committee this month that \"very robust\" technologies are being tested which \"will allow the vehicles to stay clear from humans and other vehicles. We just need to make sure that technology is robust enough to incorporate into our air system.\" The Centaur looks a lot like any other general aviation plane, with two propellers, three wheels, two passenger seats and two cockpit seats for pilots to sit in. It can fly as high as 27,500 feet and as far as 2,300 miles when it has a 200-pound payload. Top speed: about 200 mph. In just four hours, it can be converted from remote-control mode into a more traditional plane that will only fly if there's a pilot in the cockpit. But unlike typical private planes at your local executive airport, the Centaur is outfitted with gear that allows a pilot to fly it from the ground, using not much more than a laptop computer and a satellite or radio link. In company video showing the June 12-15 test in Rome, you can see equipment in the cockpit controlling the yoke, which normally would be handled by a pilot.
