The first line -- \"I'm goin' to Europe in just a couple of days\" -- has been my theme this week as I pack up. With PBS working to attract a younger market, what do you think of my new travel wardrobe? (This actually was produced a few years ago, when my daughter Jackie needed funding for her high school radio station. I said \"Sure, you can have some money...but you and your friends need to write me a rap jingle for a radio ad and let me sing -- for lack of a better word-- the last verse.\") Might this sell any tours ? Happy rapping. \nFollow Rick Steves on Twitter: www.twitter.com/RickSteves More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T05:40:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
