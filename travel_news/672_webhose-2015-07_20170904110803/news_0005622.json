Residents complain about worsening traffic and how hard it is to get around. Rising home prices are putting the squeeze on middle- and low-wage earners, including the city’s teachers, young adults and retail workers.\nThe makeup of the Bellevue City Council will change next year, with Mayor Claudia Balducci choosing to run this election season for the Metropolitan King County Council. Three candidates are vying to succeed her. She has endorsed two in the primary, journalist and longtime community volunteer Sherry Grindeland and biotech professional Vandana Slatter.\nThe third candidate, Michelle Hilhorst, in 2011 lost to a Balducci ally, Councilmember John Chelminiak. Hilhorst, an IT operations manager for AT&T with 20-plus years experience overseeing large budgets and projects, picked up the only outstanding rating from the Municipal League of King County. The other two candidates for council Position 5 were rated very good.\nMost Read Stories New twist for homebuyers — top up the fee if seller uses discount broker | Sunday Buzz How gun-tax legislation would affect Seattle firearms stores State knows when Bertha will restart, waits to share date If you think New Yorker's earthquake story is scary, better read this Passenger of missing plane found In the contest for Position 7 on the nonpartisan council, incumbent Jennifer Robertson, a land-use attorney, faces Lyndon Heywood, a bicycle and neighborhood advocate, and Bill Hirt, who filed for the seat, he says, only to publicize his anti-light-rail views. Robertson was rated outstanding by the Municipal League, Heywood adequate and Hirt not qualified.\nThe top two vote-getters in the Aug. 4 primary will advance to the November general election. Ballots will be mailed this week.\nBecause there are only two candidates for Position 3 — Chelminiak and former Councilmember Don Davidson — their names will not appear on the primary ballot.\nIncumbent John Stokes is unopposed for Position 1.\nPosition 5 As a 40-year Bellevue resident, Grindeland said her priorities include improving traffic, maintaining affordable housing in the city and ensuring that parks are part of any plan for added density. Until she retired this spring to run for the council, Grindeland was a career journalist who wrote for the former Bellevue Journal-American, The Seattle Times and most recently was editor of the SnoValley Star.\nShe served for the past six years on the Bellevue Parks Board, including the past two as chairwoman, and for a decade volunteered for Youth Link, a city leadership program.\nGrindeland said the City Council should fund transportation needs such as local bus service, bike lanes and sidewalks. She said neighborhoods are feeling closed-out of city decision-making around issues such as growth, and she wants developers to communicate with residents earlier in the planning process.\nHilhorst has served on the Bellevue Planning Commission for the past two years and was recently voted chair. She is also a former president of the Newport Hills Community Association. In her job at AT&T she said she has managed large initiatives successfully and will bring that expertise to the council. She described herself as a fiscal conservative and social moderate whose top priority is preserving public safety and excellent police, fire and paramedic services.\nHilhorst supports expanded bus service including more Metro Transit RapidRide routes. She also said she supports the steps the city has taken to encourage more affordable housing, including the council’s recent adoption of a Multifamily Tax Exemption to waive property taxes for developers who include affordable units in their apartment buildings. She said she’d like to see the city continue to find incentives to create more workforce housing including working with faith groups.\nSlatter points to her work as a clinical pharmacist for Amgen and her master’s degree in public administration, as indications that she would bring innovation and problem-solving skills to the council.\nShe said that with light rail coming to the Eastside, the council must ensure that, during construction, people and goods can move around the city. She sees transportation spending as a budget priority, and wants the city to have stronger outreach to the neighborhoods so the public understands the impacts and benefits.\nSlatter also highlights her East Indian heritage. Her parents emigrated to Canada, where she grew up. She moved to the U.S. to earn a doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Washington. With minorities making up about 40 percent of Bellevue’s population, she said she will represent that perspective on the council as well.\nSlatter serves on the Overlake Hospital Foundation Board and is a former member of the Washington State Board of Pharmacy. She finished second in a three-way primary race for council in 2013, but lost in the general election to Lynne Robinson.\nGrindeland has raised $11,400 for the campaign through July 1, Hilhorst $14,770 and Slatter $17,500, according to the state Public Disclosure Commission.\nPosition 7 Robertson said the coming construction of Sound Transit’s East Link line will need city oversight to minimize the impacts of noise and road closures on neighborhoods along the route.\nShe said she would also advocate sending to voters a tax package to fund completion of major transportation and safety projects including a rebuild of West Lake Sammamish Parkway, sidewalks along Southeast Newport Way and an HOV lane for Bellevue Way.\nRobertson, who was first elected to the council in 2009, supports the inclusion of affordable-housing incentives in the city’s downtown and Bel-Red plans. She also would like the council to take a look at stepping up efforts to prevent homelessness by potentially directing more money to helping people stay in their homes.\nHeywood, a production artist for a printing company, called the current council “too staid and conservative.” He criticized Robertson for not supporting higher property taxes to fund needed transportation, bike and pedestrian projects from 2009 through 2013.\nHe was also critical of her support for a $20 million city contribution to the proposed Tateuchi Performing Arts Center. Heywood, who ran unsuccessfully for a council seat in 2013, said the project doesn’t benefit enough residents.\nHe said he’d like to see the council have stronger outreach to the neighborhoods to give them more voice on the council. Heywood, who is active in the Lake Hills Neighborhood Association, received an adequate rating from the Municipal League. Hirt was rated not qualified.\nRobertson has raised $67,000 for her campaign. Her two opponents have not reported any contributions, according to the Washington Public Disclosure Commission.\nLynn Thompson: lthompson@seattletimes.com or 206-464-8305.
