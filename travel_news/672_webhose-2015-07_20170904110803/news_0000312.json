Working as a Centre Court steward he's seen it all, from the much-acclaimed Borg v. McEnroe final of 1980 to the nail-biting 2008 final between Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal . • When is Wimbledon 2015: dates, order of play, and how to watch it live Asked if he enjoyed watching the tennis by Kate Middleton's father, Michael Middleton, Chalmers responded: \"I'm paid to worry, not to watch,\" but some moments do stand out in his mind. Here are his favourite Wimbledon moments of the past 40 years. Virginia Wade's 1977 win Virginia Wade being crowned winner in 1977 by the Queen (Tony Duffy) In 1977, Virginia Wade became the last British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, by winning the Wimbledon singles in its centenary year. It had been her 16th year at the tournmament, one of the reasons Chalmer's lists it so high: \"Her win will always be a stand out memory for me because she finally became champion after so many years of keeping us on the edge of our seats and trying.\" Steffi Graf's 1995 win Steffi Graf (REX) In 1995, German Steffi Graf became the Wimbledon singles winner for the sixth year, beating Arantxa Sánchez. \"When you talk about excellent female players, you of course think of Serena Williams or Martina Navratilova,\" Chalmers says, \"but Steffi Graf v. Arantxa Sánchez was one of the best Women's Matches I'd ever seen.\" • Wimbledon's top 50 women players of all time - in pictures Andy Murray's 2013 win Andy Murray celebrating after winning his final match (Getty) After years of trying Andy Murray was crowned Wimbledon singles champion , becoming the first British male to win the title in 77 years. The reaction from the crowd was intense. Kim Sears punched the air, David Cameron leapt from his seat and his mother burst into tears. \"I handed Judy Murray my last Kleenex,\" Chalmers remembers, \"it was a very emotional moment.\" • Judy Murray: I danced at Andy's wedding Borg v. McEnroe 1980 Björn Borg and John McEnroe in 1980 (AP/GETTY) The high acclaimed Björn Borg v. John McEnroe final of 1980 is often heralded to be the greatest tennis match in all history. • Björn Borg and John McEnroe relive their 1980 classic \"Borg had already won four championships,\" Chalmers says, \"he was 2-1 in sets and they went into this amazing tie break. It was the only time in my entire time at Wimbledon that I'd seen the journalists applaud.\" • Wimbledon's top 50 men players of all time - in pictures Every year Alan Chalmers and his daughter Lisa, an honorary steward (Alan Chalmers) One of Chalmer's favourite things about the tournament is that you can \"walk around Wimbledon today and talk to the great names of the 50s and 60s, and they won't be mobbed by the public.\" \"I've been incredibly lucky to meet some heroes of tennis, such as Fred Perry, Ted Tinling, and Kitty Godfree.\" Tweet us your favourite Wimbledon memories @TeleGoodLife Follow @TeleGoodLife Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:28:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
