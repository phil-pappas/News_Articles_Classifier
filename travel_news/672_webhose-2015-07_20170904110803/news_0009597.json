My name is Tilman I am 33 year explorer from Berlin. survived 2009-2013 non stop in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Back here since July 2014. now I improve my Hindi and Nepali, meet lots of friendly locals and learn more about food and culture. Got 10 weeks Nepal left. Right now in the far western region in Nepal in Dadeldhura. mostly I cook my own food and go to the markets to buy veggies. a lot of time I spend very little on rooms and food but sometimes I get invited in local villages. I work and travel ( http://de.dawanda.com/shop/hippiechic ) and love to take photos. drop me a line if you wanna travel together and explore the unspoilt area here e.g. Rara Tal and sneak into Kailash. cheers Til", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T08:59:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
