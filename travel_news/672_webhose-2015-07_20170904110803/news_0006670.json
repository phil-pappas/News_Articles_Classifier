If you managed to meet the requirements of your university offer, give yourself a hearty pat on the back. However, if you didn't quite meet the mark, you may be considering entering Ucas Clearing . John Walmsley, the principal of UWC Atlantic College provides answers on how to make the most of the advantages available to you as an IB student. Useful links: • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android 1. What advantages do IB students have when it comes to Clearing? “As an IB student you have a number of advantages should you wish to use the Clearing process,\" says John Walmsley, \"the first being the luxury of time to consider your options and make the process as stress free and constructive as possible.\" • University applications: dates for your diary For those of you receiving your results today, you will be able to apply through Clearing to universities that have places available. In a new move, Ucas and the Telegraph will list Clearing vacancies from July 6 until July 27 , giving IB students a distinct advantage. You'll be able to see these vacancies via Ucas and through the Telegraph's Clearing hub and via our free apps. Following July 27, Clearing will then open again for applications on August 12 at 6pm However, it is worth noting that it is likely that more universities will be available on A-level Results Day on August 13, as they will then have a full idea of the number of places they are able to offer. 2. How can IB students capitalise on the extra time available to them? “Use your time to explore what is on offer at other universities, paying close attention to the details of each course,\" says John. \"Every university is unique and seemingly similar courses can vary greatly, so it is important not to simply apply to a university for the sake of it without looking into the structure of the course. \"Once you have identified your options, you need to take the time to present yourself as an ideal candidate who deserves a place on that course. Spend time preparing answers to questions that admission tutors may ask over the phone, making sure to point out your relevant strengths, both in curricular and extra-curricular activities. \"Remember that while academic ability is key, being able to express a genuine interest and commitment in that field of study is often crucial. You should spend time preparing for the admission tutors’ questions 3. How should you approach contacting a university? \"Once you have received your results, it is vital to research courses and universities before making an approach,\" John advises. \"With that said, it may be worth contacting universities that have not advertised vacancies as spaces may become available over the Clearing period, as some students with conditional offers may opt for alternative options. \"Some universities may not open their Clearing spaces straight away as they might not want to promote that their courses are under capacity. In this case, if it is one of your target universities, you can still be offered a place by contacting admissions offices directly. \"You should spend time preparing for the admission tutors’ questions so you can answer them to the best of your ability. Be sure to point out areas that you have excelled in. You should also mention any other relevant extra-curricular activities or interests that will stand you in good stead for gaining a place at university.\" 4. Does the IB, as a qualification, have an advantage in Clearing? \"When speaking to universities, take advantage of the breadth of skills and knowledge that you have gained during the qualification,\" says John. \"As you know, the IB curriculum is made up of six subject groups as well as what is called the DP core, comprising of three elements including the Theory of Knowledge, an extended essay and a project related to creativity, action, service, leaving you with a full range of curricular and extra-curricular skills. \"It is important to stress and give examples of these extra talents, such as teamwork or dedication, as they could make you really stand out among the crowd, and even interest the tutors.\" 5. Is it sensible to make a major course change during clearing? How can students avoid impulsively making a bad decision? \"Unfortunately, many students can become overwhelmed with the process of Clearing after having received disappointing grades,\" says John. \"The most important thing is to remain calm and keep a level head. There are plenty of options available to you, even if your exam results are not quite as you expected. \"If you have achieved a good result in a subject that is key to the course you want to apply for, but you feel let down by your other results, it is worth sticking with your original interest. After all this is clearly an area that you have excelled in, and therefore a relevant course would be suitable for you. \"Remember, you are not alone and that while ultimately the decisions you make are yours, you have family teachers and friends who know you and can help guide you towards the best course of action. This is not a time for snap choices. \"Take the time to research other courses that are available; there are many courses out there, you may not have yet discovered the perfect one for you. Your decision requires a lot of thought and consideration, which will take time. Be sure not to rush into accepting an offer on a course which is unsuited to your skills.\" In summary: • Capitalise on the extra time • Pay close attention to course details • Consider the full range of factors when looking at a university in Clearing • Prepare for admission tutor questions • Utilise the advantages of the IB qualification • Use all of the tools available • Avoid making a snap decision Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T08:26:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
