It’s frightening, it’s really incredible.” \nMs Mostosi has filed a formal written complaint with the City of Darwin over the attack. \nIn her statement to council, Mostosi said the attack occurred on Trower Rd when she stopped to seek directions from “an elderly woman”. \n“While I was speaking to her a dog came out through an open gate and attacked me, biting me hard on my left upper leg making me fall over to the right of my bicycle,” she said. \n“The woman did not help me up or say she was sorry but just said ‘ride your bicycle to the hospital’ and pointed to Delamere Rd. \n“I would have expected her to offer to take me to hospital in her car but was unable to ask her in English.” \nA City of Darwin spokesman said council was aware of the attack and were “actively investigating” the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
