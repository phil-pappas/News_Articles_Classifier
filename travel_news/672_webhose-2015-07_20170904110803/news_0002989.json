By Moira Macdonald THE SEATTLE TIMES • Sunday July 19, 2015 5:00 AM \nVictoria is unofficially the Tearoom Capital of British Columbia, and for good reason: You can’t take three steps in this pretty waterfront city without stumbling over a teacup or two. \nVisitors have long been directed to the tea lobby in the Empress Hotel and the tearoom at the Butchart Gardens, both of which are charming but tourist-crammed and pricey. \nIt’s quite possible, however, to have a lovely time in the capital of British Columbia without visiting either of these places. I spent a couple of days there in the spring and found a wealth of historic homes, gardens and off-the-beaten-path attractions — none crowded, all delightful, and some equipped with tearooms. \nHere are my favorite venues. Hatley Castle \nI didn’t know the existence of this place, a gorgeous 1908 castle-style residence surrounded by lavish gardens. \nBut I’ve seen it on-screen: Numerous movies and television episodes have been shot here, including recent films in the X-Men franchise, in which it served as the school. \nBuilt for former B.C. premier and lieutenant governor James Dunsmuir and occupied by his family until the late 1930s, Hatley Castle is now part of Royal Roads University and is open to the public. \nThe 40-room house, constructed in Tudor revival style, has a grand front hall and staircase, soaring ceilings and stained-glass windows everywhere. Although the castle is a working building for the university and therefore contains few original furnishings, it’s easy to imagine what life there might have been like, particularly when strolling the elegant gardens and loggia. \nAbout an 8-mile drive from downtown, Hatley Castle is open every day and looks glorious in the sunshine; you might spot a peacock on the lawn. \nAccess through a guided tour costs $14.50. Tickets can be bought in the gift shop in the castle basement. \nFor more information on the castle — at 2005 Sooke Rd., Victoria — call 1-866-241-0674 or visit royalroads.ca/about/castle-garden-tours Point Ellice House \nLocated in an industrial area near downtown, the enchanting 19th-century home and museum is filled with Victoriana — the furnishings, clothing and possessions of the O’Reilly family, who owned the home for more than a century. \nHistory buffs will enjoy the vintage kitchen gadgets, the elaborate wallpaper and the way the place looks as if a Victorian family just stepped away for a moment. An open book, pages down, is on the couch, as if its reader might be nearby. \nAdmission is about $4.80. \nThe house is at 2616 Pleasant St., Victoria. Call 250-380-6506 or visit pointellicehouse.ca Abkhazi Garden \nThe teacup-sized version of the Butchart Gardens is one of Victoria’s hidden treasures — a garden created by Peggy and Nicholas Abkhazi, whose personal story seems right out of the movies. He was an exiled Georgian prince who met her, a Shanghai-born British orphan and globe-trotter, in Paris in the 1920s; they were separated by World War II, when both were interned in prison camps. \nReunited after the war — neither had known whether the other survived — they married and made their way to Victoria, where they happily spent four decades cultivating their garden on a large lot on a leafy neighborhood street. \nNow open to the public, with the Abkhazis’ 1940s bungalow turned into a tearoom, the hillside garden is a delightful refuge dotted with ponds, sculpture, winding paths and quiet nooks. \nAdmission is about $8. For more information on the house at 1964 Fairfield Rd., call 778-265-6466 or visit blog.conservancy.bc.ca/properties/vancouver-island-region/abkhazi-garden Emily Carr House \nA short walk from the Inner Harbor is the butter-yellow Victorian home in which painter Emily Carr (1871-1945) spent her childhood; it’s now owned by the province and operated as a museum. \nCarr, one of Victoria’s most famous natives, was inspired by Canada’s indigenous tribes, with totem poles and forests frequent subjects of her work. Her home, open May through September, is both a shrine to her and a peek at 19th-century family life in Victoria. \nAdmission is $6.75. Call 250-383-5843 or visit emilycarr.com Victoria Public Market \nA relatively new addition to Victoria’s downtown, the Victoria Public Market is a fun place to wander and explore. \nA farmers market sets up shop every Wednesday and Saturday, and vendors offer meats, seafood, baked goods, flowers, cheese, tea and more. \nThe market is at 1701 Douglas St., Victoria.
