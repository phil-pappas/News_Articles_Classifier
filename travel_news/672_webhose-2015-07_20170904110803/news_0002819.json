Founded in 1862, a year after Nevada became a territory, the prison has housed everyone from mining boom-era “desperadoes” to card cheats from Las Vegas. \nThe National Park Service is reviewing a lengthy application for the prison to be put on the National Register of Historic Places. \nIf the prison opens to tours, it would join Alcatraz and other prisons in the U.S. that have become tourist attractions. \n“People are interested in prisons and want to see the inside of them,” said Sean Kelley, senior vice president at the Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site in Philadelphia, which draws about 400,000 visitors a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T14:48:30.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
