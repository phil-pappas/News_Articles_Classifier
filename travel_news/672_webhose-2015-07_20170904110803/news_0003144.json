Any decisions that are made are usually subjected to lengthy delays while waiting for approval. \n\nThere are also accusations from interviewees that priority is given to providing hospitality services to government officials. \n\nDespite these complaints, the interviewees also noted that managers of state-owned hotels are more loyal to their employers compared to those in the private sector, and the style of management is more “humanised”. \n\nFurthermore, high staff turnover rates do not seem to be a problem among employees of state-owned hotels. They seem to enjoy regular staff meetings, social activities, and “abundant training and internal promotion opportunities”. \n\nNevertheless, researchers note the lack of staff motivation in state-owned hotels. These positions may provide job security but offer no incentives for employees to excel. \n\nThe researchers conclude with the suggestion that management be shifted to the regional level to remove competition among local state-owned hotels, to elevate their competitive power in the market, and to take advantage of the ”premium geographical location” of many state-owned hotels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:14:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
