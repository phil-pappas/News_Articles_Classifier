Guests can easily arrange day trips from the hotel to Karen, Nairobi National Park and other major game reserves and attractions in Kenya. \nOn our way to and from the airport we had the pleasure of chatting with Benjamin, a driver and tour guide for the hotel. Although we did not have the opportunity to arrange one of the many tours on offer with Benjamin, it should be noted that he is very knowledgeable about the history, politics and geographic regions of Kenya. If we return to Tribe, we will certainly book an excursion and request that he is our guide. \nThe hotel’s design, art and furniture are distinctly African with modern accents; many of the featured furnishings were created by artisans and artists from all across the continent. Superior and Deluxe rooms are well appointed with a king size or double beds, LCD television and rain shower. Some of the rooms feature a large soaking tub – a luxurious amenity particularly on cooler evenings after a long day of being out in the city. A range of ultra-luxe suites are also available for booking. \nNEST, the rooftop Moroccan-inspired lounge is located on the fourth floor, featuring views of the chicly designed pool area. A variety of fruity shisha flavors are on offer along with libations, small bites and sushi plates. Come 8:00 p.m. the lounge is alive with sensual music and the laughter of guests. My husband and I enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere on three occasions after spending the day exploring different areas of Nairobi. \nTribe’s main restaurant Jiko is inspired by the open flame grill and offers seasonal, organic cuisine. Breakfast (included in nightly rate), lunch and dinner are served here and outdoor seating, situated close to the pool and waterfall, is available. \nThe lobby, adorned with exquisite African art and surreal furniture pieces has ample seating appropriate for business meetings or for enjoying a cocktail or coffee. Also located in the lobby is a cappuccino bar serving a range of caffeinated drinks and unique desserts from handmade chocolates to macaroons and cupcakes (a favorite of mine). During our stay, a cupcake was also brought to our room during the nightly turndown service – quite the sweet touch! \nAlthough I did not have the pleasure of enjoying a spa treatment at Kaya, it was noted among friends of mine that the spa is the place to relax and unwind in Nairobi. The gym, open 24-hours, features state-of-the-art equipment and a small boxing room. I was able to complete my intense routine workout in full thanks to the variety of machines and equipment on offer. The Africa Yoga project offers classes most Sundays before brunch commences as an all-day lively affair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T08:59:10.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
