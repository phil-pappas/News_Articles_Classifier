The officer told Liu he was under arrest and then led Liu to the jet way, where he continued to refuse commands to stop resisting. \nAfter a continued struggle, Hernandez said he gave a one-second burst of pepper spray to Liu's face. \nSeveral of Liu's friends, who were on the plane, shouted at the officer that they were filming the incident and to let him go. Ad Feedback \nHernandez then directed Liu to the ground, where he immediately turned over and held an \"aggressive fighting stance,\". \nBy this time, Hernandez had radioed twice for backup and Liu was shouting to his friends to \"film this\". \nThe officer then drew his stun gun and told Liu \"one last time to roll over onto his stomach and place his hands behind his back\". \nLiu complied after friends told him \"don't worry I got you,\" Hernandez wrote in the report. \nHe was handcuffed and arrested on charges of battery on a law enforcement officer, resisting with violence and disorderly conduct. \nLiu was released from the Orange County jail on bail. \nOrlando Sentinel/TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T08:51:11.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
