Ringing the local pizza parlour or heating up a ready meal are clearly among the simplest ways to rustle up your evening meal. Although it certainly isn’t as convenient, there’s a much cheaper and more fun way to do it. In recent years, the idea of going foraging for food in the wild has become a cool way of topping up the weekly shop. The likes of TV survivalists such as Bear Grylls and Ray Mears have certainly awakened the inner hunter-gatherer instinct in many of us. But if you’re largely an urban dweller with little knowledge of what’s going on in nature, how easy is it to do? Well, it’s not going to be as simple as popping down to the supermarket. But with a little bit of research, forward planning and great care, it can be more successful than you might imagine. If you’re trying it on your own or with a mate, start by keeping your expectations modest. You’re unlikely to come back with a three-course meal on your first excursion. The golden rule of foraging is never to risk picking anything you’re not totally sure about In spring, for instance, freshly picked young nettle leaves make a lovely addition to curries, stews, risottos and soups. In early summer, elderflowers make a refreshing cordial drink. As autumn arrives, go picking blackberries. Armed with Tupperware containers, you’ll still be eating crumbles and pies for months. Be careful not to prick your fingers, don’t pluck any berries below dog leg-cocking height, and do leave some on the bushes for others. Another autumn treat for the forager is scouring the hedgerows for sloes and damsons. Both are the ideal ingredients for a delicious fruity gin that will mature perfectly in time for Christmas. The golden rule of foraging is never to risk picking anything you’re not totally sure about. Some wild mushrooms and plants can make you very ill or even kill you. To make sure that what you gather is edible, do as much research as you can before you start and ideally get yourself a pocket guidebook to carry with you for reference. Alternatively, you can go out with a more experienced forager until you feel confident to go it alone or with friends who are equally new to it. Look online for groups or individuals who lead foraging groups in your area. Often locals with a good knowledge of the area are able to take you to places with easy pickings for the keen forager.
