The iconic structure attracts more than a million people a year. Florida wasn’t always Spanish; from 1763 to 1783, it was a proud British colony, and three signers of the Declaration of Independence were imprisoned here at what briefly was called Fort St. Marks. www.nps.gov/casa.\nFountain of Youth Archaeological Park: It’s one of Florida’s oldest tourist attractions. Scholars say there’s no evidence Juan Ponce de León ever heard the phrase “Fountain of Youth,” much less sought the imaginary place; the legend would spring up (pun intended) more than a decade after Ponce’s 1521 death. But go ahead; take a drink. What have you got to lose? www.fountainofyouthflorida.com.\nBridge of Lions, St. Augustine, 1982. The bridge recently was renovated. (May Lou Norwood/ Florida Photographic Archives). Mission of Nombre de Dios: The reconstructed 1587 mission stands in front of the 208-foot-tall stainless steel cross, which signifies the arrival of Christianity in the new world. missionandshrine.org.\nFort Matanzas National Monument: Even as he boasted he was introducing a religion of peace, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés didn’t act very Christian. He did bad things to the local peoples, then dragged French settlers from Jacksonville to St. Augustine’s Matanzas Inlet. Matanzas is Spanish for slaughter, and here Don Pedro cut the Protestants’ throats. Fort Matanzas, built in 1740, guarded St. Augustine’s southern river approach. www.nps.gov/foma.\nFlagler College: Henry Flagler’s former Hotel Ponce de Leon now comprises the main building of this 2,600-student private school. www.flagler.edu.\n“Foot Soldiers Monument” to civil rights struggle in St. Augustine (myfloridahistory.org) Fort Mose State Park: Pronounced moh-ZAY, it was founded in 1738 as America’s first free community of ex-slaves. Archaeologists unearthed it in 1980. fortmose.org\nBridge of Lions: Built in 1927 to connect Anastasia Island, its namesake lions guard the entrance from the mainland. After an $80 million renovation project, the bridge reopened in 2010 .\nPlaza de la Constitución: That slaves were sold in St. Augustine isn’t in dispute. Records show some were sold at the open-air structure here at the plaza, now sometimes called the “slave market” , but it’s unlikely it was formally or regularly used for that purpose. Its main use was sales of produce, meat and fish. Nearby, the new Foot Soldiers Monument, which honors civil rights pioneers — the city was Ground Zero for the 1960s civil rights movement i n Florida —overlooks a bank that once was a Woolworth’s department store where desegregation sit-ins occurred. Down the street, but torn down years ago, is the Monson Motor Lodge . In June 1964, Martin Luther King Jr., and other blacks were refused service at the motel’s restaurant, and some blacks defiantly jumped in its pool; the owner poured pool acid to run them out, and the image, shown nationwide, helped push through the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\nFlagler College campus in St. Augustine (Flagler College) St. Augustine Visitor Center: 904-825-1000. www.historicstaugustine.com .", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/06/30/0d/3c/pr14349.jpg", "http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/geo-flor/26.htm", "http://www.accordfreedomtrail.org/four.htm", "http://civilrights.flagler.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p16000coll11/id/4", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/06/30/d9/cf/staugustinefootsoldiers-59.jpg", "http://staugustine-450.com/50-years-later-monson-motor-lodge-pool-civil-rights-demonstration/", "http://civilrightsmuseumstaug.webs.com/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/06/30/f8/f9/flagleredu.jpg", "http://www.nps.gov/casa", "http://missionandshrine.org/", "http://augustine.com/history/black_history/slave_market/", "http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2010/todays-news/bridge-of-lions-reopens.html", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/06/30/93/88/FOY-st.-aug.jpg", "http://www.nps.gov/foma/"], "published": "2015-07-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T04:15:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
