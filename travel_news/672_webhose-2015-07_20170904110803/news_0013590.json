Predictably, SMEs are almost universally enthusiastic about saving energy, the study found. But 70pc also cited protecting the environment as a key motivating factor, alongside the more obvious short-term desire to save money. Whatever the exact reason behind this recent change of heart – a 2013 poll found that nearly half of SMEs didn’t see going green as useful for their business at all – it’s becoming increasingly clear that small businesses shouldn’t be asking if they can afford to go green, but if they can afford not to. “There is an increasing volume of environmental legislation and it is more expensive, less efficient and more disruptive to have to change what you do to meet legal obligations than to already be operating in a manner that is compliant,” says Toby Robins, sustainable development director at green consultancy Wiles Greenworld. Green means lean In other words, the direction of travel is set. SMEs will find themselves increasingly encouraged – whether by legislation, customers or staff – to adopt environmentally-friendly practices whether they like it or not. SMEs that are ahead of the curve can benefit from efficiency savings and business advantage. “There are many financial benefits to being a green business, from those waste-cutting, energy-saving measures that have historically been implemented under the banner of ‘efficiency’, through to the harder-to-quantify financial benefits derived from shared value customer acquisition and retention, and being an employer of choice,” says Mr Robins. SMEs that are ahead of the curve can benefit from efficiency savings and business advantage Technology can play a huge part in that quest for advantage, experts believe. If you use motor-driven machinery for manufacturing, for example, variable speed drives can reduce energy consumption by as much as 60pc, according to ABB Group . For a 90kW motor in continuous duty, that can mean over £9,000 per year in savings. And if you provide company cars, a more fuel efficient model – achieving 10 miles per gallon more, say – can save you hundreds of pounds a year. Closing the loop But even for small office-based SMEs, savings – in both cash and carbon – are easily achievable. The increasing use of cloud computing is benefitting office efficiency and the environment, says Simon Osman, CEO of cloud services provider iFollowOffice. When staff can access documents and work from anywhere, commuting can be reduced, and that’s only one advantage. “Flexibility aside, many cloud providers offer pay-per-user, per-month services, which are significantly cheaper than expensive on-site IT infrastructure that requires excessive processing power to run. Not only is this costly for businesses, it’s costly for the environment. The fact is the cloud can massively reduce the carbon footprint of many business applications,” says Mr Osman. Even something as simple as printing can provide low-hanging fruit for SMEs wanting to reduce their environmental impact. You may already print on both sides of the paper and the HP Planet Partners Programme is a simple system for customers to return and recycle their used Original HP toner and ink cartridges for free. This “closed loop” programme, the first of its type in the industry, has recycled more than 500 million ink and toner cartridges since 1991. Recycling printer cartridges is a step in the right direction, and not every SME will want to go as far as Wiles Greenworld, which is transitioning to becoming a zero-carbon operation. But their example shows the scale of possible savings from the greening of small business. “If we were still operating the way we were in 2008 when we first started measuring our footprint, then we would be using three times as much fuel in our vehicles today,” says Mr Robins. “It was so long ago that we last paid or contributed to the payment of the Landfill Tax that I don't know when it was.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • The real cost of... outsourcing your IT department • Top five security issues that every SME should know about • Five tips for growing your company • How to prepare staff for big news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:57:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
