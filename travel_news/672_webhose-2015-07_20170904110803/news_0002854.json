In June, the airline was ranked fourth globally.”\nSAA has already increased frequencies to key African destinations such as Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mauritius, among others.\n“The positive commercial impact of a demand-side response not only indicates that there are positive gains to be made through network efficiencies but, that sound commercial decision making will benefit the business in the medium to long term,” explained Bezuidenhout.\nAfrica remains a key focus area for SAA as aviation has the potential to make an important contribution to the further economic development and growth on the continent. “It connects countries, markets and facilitates trade and connects Africa to global supply chain links,” he added.\nRelated Posts Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai Norwegian announced three long-haul routes to America BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T06:52:19.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
