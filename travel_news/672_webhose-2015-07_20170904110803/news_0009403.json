Farah, was grilled by the United States Anti-Doping Agency lawyer Bill Bock, the man who helped to bring down Lance Armstrong, at London’s Grange Tower Bridge Hotel the day after taking 3,000m victory at the Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games . That race was Farah’s first on home soil since the allegations were first made against Alberto Salazar, who is subject to separate investigations by anti-doping agencies in the UK and the US. Salazar denies doping allegations. • London Anniversary Games: as it happened Next on Bock’s list are a number of senior British Athletics figures including Neil Black, performance director, and Barry Fudge, head of endurance and the man who has spent time at Farah’s training base in the Pyrenees in the absence of Salazar himself. Farah claimed 3,000m victory at the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games Farah had said previously that he was happy to cooperate with any investigation and it is understood that the meeting on Saturday with Bock was scheduled for some time. Keen to speak to Bock before returning to his French training base, Farah told the American lawyer that he had never taken any illegal substances and he would split from Salazar if any proof of illegal activity emerged . Only a day earlier Farah had told journalists at the Olympic Stadium that he was aiming to put aside any external distractions as he looks to defend his two world titles in Beijing next month. Asked whether he would try to keep the Salazar situation in the background, Farah replied: “Yeah, it’s really important. I have done that already. At the same time, I need to keep doing what I am doing and enjoy what I am doing.” Farah was quizzed for five hours about Alberto Salazar (centre) USADA has been busy interviewing people associated with Salazar, speaking to around 15 whistleblowers as well as half a dozen Nike Oregon Project athletes. One of those, Treniere Moser, said last month that she had spoken to investigators . “I have done my part and I’ve talked to them and I gave them everything they wanted, that’s all I can do,” she said. “My whole thing going into it was, as long as I’m truthful, like I have nothing to hide, it’s not hard. I told them everything I knew and they were really nice about it. They told me what they were looking for and I just told them what I knew.” Farah has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but says his name has been “dragged through the mud” by the allegations surrounding Salazar, who has vehemently denied breaking anti-doping rules. The double Olympic champion received sympathy from Usain Bolt last week, with the Jamaican saying he understood Farah’s decision to stand by his coach. “I’m sorry for Mo, because every day I hear in the papers they’re trying to tear him down,” Bolt said. “I just really hope that he doesn’t take it too seriously and it doesn’t stress him out. It’s part of the sport, people like to point fingers sometimes.” British Athletics is conducting its own review into its relationship with Salazar and is expected to report its findings in the next couple of weeks.
