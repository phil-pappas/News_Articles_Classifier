A 75-year-old bridge on Kingshighway between Southwest/Vandeventer and Shaw Boulevard that spans Union Pacific Railroad tracks will undergo a $21 million reconstruction project. The work, funded by the Federal Highway Administration and Union Pacific Railroad, will be performed by contractor Kozeny-Wagner Inc. Construction will need to accommodate the railroad's schedule. Crews will close northbound Kingshighway about 10 a.m. Monday and final closure of the span will occur by 3 p.m. Detour signs will be posted. Southbound Kingshighway will be directed to use eastbound Shaw to Vandeventer; northbound Kingshighway drivers will use Vandeventer to westbound McRee. Cyclists should continue to use Macklind and Tower Grove avenues.
