If it’s not seen as fakery is looks like fantasy.\nAnd that is why Prime Minister Tony Abbott now has less than two weeks to ease his mate Bronwyn out of the Speaker’s chair and the accompanying suite of offices rated the best in Parliament House.\nMs Bishop would be of no assistance to the Parliament (or the Government) if she tried to enforce standards while her own behaviour was considered a joke.\nShe is a servant of the Parliament as one of its two presiding officers, with the President of the Senate. But the ultimate decision to move her from the Speakership will be a political one.\nIf Ms Bishop is seen as an embarrassment and a distraction the Government could do without, the decision will be made.\nThe two-week deadline marks the time between now and the return of MPs for the Spring session and the guarantee Labor will attack Ms Bishop by formal motion.\nExpect some helicopter noises when she takes the chair.\nA Speaker — more than a minister — is vulnerable to ridicule because the office holder is seen so often disciplining others.\nYou can’t enforce the rules when many think you break them yourself.\nAsk Labor’s Leo McLeay. In 1993 he quit the Speakership after being accused — falsely — of a dodgy compensation claim. The $65,000 he received for a bicycle accident was viewed as excessive and he couldn’t survive the accusations or the satire.\nThere were enough jokes flying around about Bronwyn Bishop already.\nShe could withstand the cartoons about her hairstyle and imperial manner because much of it was affectionate.\nThere is little affection around now and every media outlet would be able to record the anger in the comments of their consumers. And the mockery.\nVoters already struggle to have faith in their political leaders and this Bishop episode will confirm the cynicism of those already distrustful and recruit more doubters. Mrs Bishop’s determination not to apologise makes matters worse.\nLabor will do all it can to ramp that up, having seen how effective Tony Abbott was in this department when he was Opposition Leader.\nOriginally published as Why Bronwyn Bishop needs to go now", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/why-bronwyn-bishop-should-fly-the-coop-but-not-by-chopper/story-fn5tas5k-1227461637440"], "published": "2015-07-29T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:47:21.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
