Best of all, InnsAlongTheCoast has crafted itinerary suggestions for Food Lovers , Outdoor Adventurers and Art and Culture enthusiasts. Everyone booking a 3 town excursion receives these complimentary trip helpers from your innkeeper. And unlike a hotel, your innkeepers are always on hand to help you plan your day’s activities (sunny or not) to be sure you’re having a great time. \nClint and I spent last week exploring the coast of Maine and we had a spectacular time. Here are some of highlights of our trip: \nKennebunkport Don’t Miss: Beaching it at one of 5 beaches featuring wide smooth sands or big dramatic rocks and crashing surf; take a 2 hour harbor sail on the Schooner Eleanor past light houses and the Bush mansion at Walker’s Point, Kayak through the harbor and into the river on the other side, visit the Brick Store Museum with 3 historic buildings preserving regional history, art and archives. \nWhere to Stay: \nRockland \nDon’t Miss: In addition to unique Main Street shops where fine art is mixed with bric-a-brack and nautical wares, Rockland has a number of world-class museums including the acclaimed Farnsworth Art Museum and Wyeth Center, the Owls Head Transportation Museum , and the Maine Lighthouse Museum . Also worth discovering are the Project Puffin Visitors Center, the Island Institute and Rockland Breakwater Light (where you can walk the one mile granite breakwater out to the lighthouse at low tide). We had a fab time on Captain Jack’s Lobsterboat Adventure , learning just how hard lobstermen work for the delicacy we all love. Or sail on the Morning in Maine schooner. One absolute highlight was the scenic drive out to South Thomaston and Owls Head. McLoons Lobster Shack is perched at the water’s edge (follow the signs off Rt 73), where you can watch fishing boats unload their catch while eating delicious lobster, crab and grilled little necks – outstanding! Work off lunch by climbing to the top of the Owls Head Lighthouse for dramatic coastal views (open weekends) and visit Breakwater Vineyards for a wine tasting on your way back to Rockland center. \nWhere To Stay: \nBar Harbor \nDon’t Miss: Leave your car at your accommodation and bike, walk or use the park’s free-to-all Island Explorer buses to navigate the park. Acadia has 130 miles of hiking trails so there is a path perfect for every ability. One of the most scenic and accessible is the one mile shore path beginning at the town pier and running along the ocean at Frenchman Bay. Sailing enthusiasts should not miss the chance to sail an historic Friendship Sloop in Southwest or Northeast Harbor. Take the kids aboard the Lulu Lobster Boat to learn all about lobsters and enjoy a scenic nature tour. We saw bald eagles, seals, shore birds, lobsters and of course beautiful coastal scenery. Visit Jordan Pond to sample warm popovers with strawberry jam and perhaps do some kayaking. Stop at Thunder Hole just before high tide to see pounding waves spray 40 feel into the air. There are just too many activities to list, but be sure you pick up a copy of Acadia Weekly (a free publication) to find a listing of park ranger hosted tours – many of them a free to participate in. \nWhere To Stay: \nSo with the summer stretching out before us, head up Route 95 and coastal Route 1 for some pampering in Maine. You’ll return home with memories of fresh butter-dipped lobster, tender summer fruit pies and dozens of historic lighthouses offering unforgettable views of the rugged Maine coast. Our thanks to InnsAlongTheCoast for helping us plan our Maine adventure – we had a unforgettable trip!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:37:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
