Fantatsic rainy fog makes this image so attractive so much in the best framework. All the best and have a good day! Takero (46194) 2015-07-29 20:36 \nHi Alex Nothing like an iron horse & the feel of good old days ride routing around the stations that goes with steam & smoke! The strong red colour breaker really zings in the fuzzy greyish environment - this makes it real special. It's well taken from a fine view point aided by the two mystery figs for scale proportion and liveliness. Brill shot, Congrats Best regards (62081) 2015-07-29 21:48 \nA steam-engine running on wine... that's new, my humor only, Alexandre. We do not have such locomotives in Israel, nor I never taken a ride in one alike - so for me its kind of greaty attraction. The misty background gave special texture to the scene.
