These are some of New Zealand’s most beautiful wilderness locations, a variety of unique environments that will inspire real-life Robinson Crusoe experiences.\nEach island comes with its own charm, some with basic setups, others boasting luxury accommodation. An island getaway in New Zealand is the way to encounter some of the country’s rarest wildlife, taste the best wine and escape the hustle and bustle of the mainland.\nThe Bay of Islands is exactly as it is described, a myriad of islands on the northeastern coast of New Zealand and only a 45-minute flight from Auckland.One of 144 islands that make up ‘the bay of islands’, is Roberton Island also known as Motuarohia Island. The small island is a quick 20-minute boat ride from Paihia or Russell yet, once there, visitors will feel a million miles away.\nRoberton Island is home to the luxury Cook’s Cove retreat, one of only five houses on the island and a superior eco-friendly, self-sustaining getaway. Guests enjoy a private beach with jetty access, their own helipad and island activities such as walks, diving, kayaking and snorkelling.\nThe island has a significant Maori history and offers a range of recreation activities, including a walking track to an important Maori village site, and an educational underwater trail for snorkelers. It is also home to two crystal clear lagoons – one the most photographed scenes in the Bay.\nSource:-New Zealand Tourism\nTags: bay of islands , J.D.
