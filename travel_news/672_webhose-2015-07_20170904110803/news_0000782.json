Sleeping at Kargil is a good idea but again its better to give a day more at Leh. Hunder to Pangong via Wari La and Pangong to Tsomoriri are long drives, and specially in that altitude, it might not be a good option to go for. Again give a more day in between. With this itinerary you may be able to cover places with nearly given up bodies but won't be able to enjoy the beauty of Ladakh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T15:00:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
