The longest homeport of any industry cruise ship ever in Xiamen, SuperStar Libra will operate 3-day/2-night cruises to Penghu, Taiwan and 6-day/5-night cruises to Miyakojima and Naha, Okinawa in Japan throughout the summer and autumn. \nGreeting SuperStar Libra in Xiamen during the welcome ceremony were government officials and representatives from the city of Xiamen, Xiamen Port Holding Group and the Xiamen Municipal Tourism Bureau, Taiwan Visitors Association and the Penghu Municipal County. The event was highlighted by an energetic lion dance, a captivating dance performance by SuperStar Libra’s talented performers, and a special presentation by the ship’s award-winning chefs. \nXiamen also holds a special personal connection with Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Genting Hong Kong Limited, the parent company of Star Cruises, who can trace his ancestry back to the Fujian province. Starting in 1996, Star Cruises’ fleet, including Star Pisces, SuperStar Leo, SuperStar Aquarius, etc., have conducted more than 400 calls into Xiamen, bringing over 500,000 visitors to the city. \n“In response to the Fujian government’s plan to grow the city as a major cruise destination, Star Cruises is looking forward to its homeport in Xiamen for the next three months,” said Mr. Ang Moo Lim, Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing & Hotels, Genting Hong Kong. “China is an important market for us in the region and we have regularly visited Xiamen in the past for short-term homeports with SuperStar Gemini in 2013 and SuperStar Virgo in 2014 and 2015. With cruising gaining in popularity in the country, the long-term deployment of SuperStar Libra in Xiamen will facilitate cross-strait cruises to enhance cultural exchange and boost tourism development in the region.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:14:12.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
