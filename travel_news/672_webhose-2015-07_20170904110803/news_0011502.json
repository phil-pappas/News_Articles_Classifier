The paintings tell the story of African-Americans who moved from the rural South to Northern cities in the early decades of the 20th century. Lawrence lived in Harlem, and the walking tour highlights the places where he studied art, did research and found inspiration.\nThe tour — http://www.Moma.org/harlemwalkingtour — includes a map, images, narration and interviews showcasing a dozen Harlem locations. They include Harlem Hospital, where the first floor is decorated with murals created by one of Lawrence's mentors, Charles Alston; the Abyssinian Baptist Church, which Lawrence's family joined in 1930; and cultural institutions like the Schomburg Center, a public library site where Lawrence did much of his research.\nThe MOMA exhibit is up through Sept. 7 but the tour will be available online well beyond that, offering a look at the neighbourhood even if you can't do the tour in person.\nThe walking tour is also being incorporated into a monthly pub crawl for Harlem newcomers. Eat Sip N' See describes itself as \"part sightseeing tour and part bar, pub, restaurant crawl\" with events scheduled for July 30, Aug. 28 and one on Sept. 25 aimed at students from Columbia University and City University of New York. Details on tickets and registration at http://www.harlem5ive.com/. Proceeds from the crawl benefit a fund for restoring the Harlem Hospital murals highlighted on the MOMA Jacob Lawrence trail. The crawl meets at the hospital and participants are also supplied with a link to the walking tour.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T22:40:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
