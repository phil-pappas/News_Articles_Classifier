Dr Nathalie Pettorelli, a research fellow at the Institute of Zoology, and Dr Seirian Sumner, a senior lecturer in behavioural biology at Bristol University, were recently recognised by the Prime Minister for their efforts to make women more visible within the industry. Describing the fallout within the science community following Sir Tim’s comments, Dr Sumner said: “It was horrendous what he said but I think he sort of regrets it. “I think it’s done a very good service to us in that it has raised the profile of the debate and brought it to the public’s attention. “Being so outrageous it’s made it acceptable for people to talk about it now and that’s a really good thing. “Particularly for the younger generation, they need to know that it’s acceptable to talk about their future careers and what barriers might stand in their way.” Sir Tim, a Nobel Prize winner, resigned from prestigious positions at University College London and the Royal Society after it emerged he had said female scientists cry when criticised and called for segregated laboratories. On Wednesday, sources at UCL said Sir Tim would not be offered back his honorary title at the university. He later apologised for the remarks which he said were a joke. His subsequent resignation has provoked a row within the science community , with leading figures on both sides of the argument. However Dr Pettorelli praised the positive reaction that some scientific institutions have had to Sir Tim’s comments. She said: “Having the Royal Society telling you that they are taking this seriously and it’s going to be tackled is a strongly worded message. “There was so much anger when Tim Hunt’s comment came out and there was so much disagreement about whether it was acceptable the positive anger that came in the aftermath is quite an interesting idea. “I don’t want the next generation here to wonder if it’s acceptable or not - they should just not have to hear it”. It comes as scientist and television presenter Professor Brian Cox said critics should stop attacking Sir Tim. Professor Cox told the Evening Standard he was glad serious issues in the science world were still being talked about But he said criticism of Sir Tim and Connie St Louis, the journalist behind the original story about Sir Tim's remarks, should stop. Dr Sumner and Dr Pettorelli founded Soapbox Science, an initiative which works with the UK’s top female academics to make women in science more visible. David Cameron praised their work last week, saying: “It’s so important that girls feel as able as boys to pursue a career in science. And it’s great that thousands of people can look to Seirian and Nathalie as role models.” He has awarded the pair 'Points of Light', an award which has been developed in partnership with the US programme first established by President George Bush. Discussing the award, Dr Sumner said it was nice to be recognised outside the industry, \"it shows that the Government are sitting up and taking notice of the problems of women in the scientific community\". Now in its fifth year, the festival had seven events across the UK last month, involving more than 90 female scientists. A speaker at the inaugural Soapbox Festival, Ottoline Leyser, thought to be a former student of Sir Tim, has also called for an end to the criticism of his comments. Dr Leyser and Dame Athene Donale, both Cambridge professors, said in a joint letter to the Times: “It's time for all of us to stop cowering and shouting, buck-passing and finger pointing and start listening and talking.\" Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T08:26:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
