The Buyer has paid a cash deposit to IHG of $94m, with the remaining proceeds payable in cash on completion.\nThe Buyer has made a further commitment to invest in a significant refurbishment of the Hotel. This is expected to commence in 2017 and will take place over a period of approximately 18 months.\nIHG will retain a 37-year management contract on the Hotel, with three 10-year extension rights, giving an expected contract length of 67 years. Management fees payable to IHG are initially expected to be approximately $8m per annum, increasing following the refurbishment.\nThe Hotel is internationally-acclaimed as one of the world’s most famous hotels, with a five-star rating from the Forbes Travel Guide, three Michelin-starred restaurants, and a wide range of state-of-the-art meeting and banqueting facilities. It is situated on the Kowloon waterfront, with unrivalled panoramic views of Victoria Harbour and Hong Kong’s skyline. The Hotel opened in 1980 and has 503 guest rooms, including 87 suites, and has been wholly owned by IHG and operated under the InterContinental brand since 2001.\nIn 2014, the Hotel generated EBIT of $42m, and, as at 31 December 2014, had a net book value of $298m. The transaction will give rise to an estimated exceptional pre-tax profit on disposal of $700m, with an estimated exceptional non-cash tax charge of $40m.\nThe transaction is scheduled to complete in the second half of 2015. A decision on a return of funds to shareholders from these proceeds, alongside those received from the sale of InterContinental Paris – Le Grand, will be announced at preliminary results in February 2016.\nRichard Solomons, Chief Executive Officer of IHG commented: “The InterContinental Hong Kong is an exceptional property and an iconic hotel in our portfolio. This sale highlights the enduring appeal of InterContinental as one of the world’s leading luxury hotel brands. We are very pleased to be working closely with a highly regarded hotel investor that will be a great partner for IHG and with whom we look forward to building a successful long term relationship.\nSource:-IHG\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Jumeirah Creekside Hotel raises the bar on sustainability standards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:57:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
