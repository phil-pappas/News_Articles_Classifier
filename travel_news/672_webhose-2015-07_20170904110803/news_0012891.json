The lightweight NosiLife Tafari Jersey Skirt is flared in such a way that it’s not skin-hugging tight, and the comfortable jersey fabric feels like a soft T-shirt. A roll-over waistband makes it easy to adjust the length to suit your travel situation, especially when you’re in a place that requires knee coverage. The skirt is especially suited to warm-weather travel, and is extremely easy to care for — just toss it in the washer (or your trusty hotel room sink), dry, and you’re set without needing to bust out the iron. Wear it for walking around town or out to dinner, and you won’t have to pack quite so much. \nWhat we liked: A zippered security pocket inside the waistband allows you to stash a little cash while you’re out and about. \nNot so much: The insect-repellent fabric may help keep the bugs at bay, but remember that a skirt only covers so much. Slather on the repellent or cover up if you’re in a mosquito-heavy zone. \nVitals: Craghoppers NosiLife Tafari Jersey Skirt, $60 from www.us.craghoppers.com . \n— Jill K.
