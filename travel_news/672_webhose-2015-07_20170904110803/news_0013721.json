The committee suggested the new surcharge rates rise to 75 baht for saloon taxis and 95 baht for larger taxi vans while the minister wanted the rate to be a bit lower, perhaps to 60 baht and 80 baht respectively. \nHowever, the final decision has not yet been made. \n\"The 50 baht surcharge will not be changed, neither will there be a discussion about a subsidised budget to absorb the hike for passengers,\" he said. Flights 'personalised' by 2018 \nPersonalised services through mobile devices will be the focus of airlines over the next three years, according to the latest survey of SITA 2015 Airline IT Trends. \nThe survey was conducted in association with Airline Business magazine early this year by sending questionnaires to a senior IT executive in each of the top 200 passenger carriers. \nIt found that only 20% of airlines offered services that are personalised for individual passengers. But the number will increase in the next three years when 82% of airlines will address the issue by tailoring their services to fit each passenger's need at the airport and during their flight. \nThe services will not be limited to flight discovery function, but also information updates relating to baggage and customer service that can resolve travel problems. \nAt the airport, kiosks and beacons will also play a part in delivering a personalised journey. Passengers, for instance, will be able to download content for the flight including books and films from media kiosks to their tablets or smartphones. About 22% of airlines are expecting to offer this service by 2018. \nThe survey also predicted that those personalised services will be available through smartphones, tablet and social media. \nIn terms of wearable technology, the survey found that only 7% of airlines have so far looked at its potential while the majority of airlines are still waiting to see how others will implement this technology.
