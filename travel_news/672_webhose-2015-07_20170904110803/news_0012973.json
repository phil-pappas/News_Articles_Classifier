In fact, until just a few months ago, Africa was a distant destination, a dream destination, for sure, but a place that existed for me largely in my mind.\nAfrica had never been home, but my understanding of this continent changed dramatically this year with not just one but two very distinct \"pinch me\" experiences.\nThe first involved summiting Africa's highest peak, a bucket list trip that altered me in ways I wasn't expecting. The second involved a different kind of peak -- a career highlight for sure -- and certainly solidified my feelings toward this once-faraway place.\nI first set foot on African soil just four months ago, when I traveled to Tanzania. I was 35 years old, had just moved to New York and decided it was time to stop talking about Africa and finally go.\nBut I needed to go in a big way -- and to me, that meant attempting to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, all 19,345 feet of it.\nBy the time I reached the summit, I was changed, physically and emotionally. From the moment I started back down the mountain, the little voice in my head wondered: When would I return to Africa?\nLittle did I know that answer would be just four months later.\nDiscovering Kenya 10 photos CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin recently visited a Maasai village in Kenya's Masai Mara. She was greeted with a traditional Maasai warrior song followed by a walk around the village to see the cattle and goats (the village's currency) and women's beadwork. She was sent off by the local kids. (They didn't speak English but knew exactly how to high five.)

Hide Caption 10 of 10 In late spring, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would be traveling to Kenya in July for his Entrepreneurship Summit.\nLast summer, he invited all the African leaders to Washington, and he has created a number of U.S.-based African initiatives.\nBut this trip would be special, because it would be the first time as sitting president that Obama would return to Kenya and revisit his roots.\nIt was a story I wanted to tell. With hard work and some good help, I eventually landed an exclusive interview with Auma Obama , President Obama's half-sister.\nMy producer and I would travel to the Obama family's ancestral village in western Kenya, visit Sauti Kuu (Swahili for \"powerful voices\"), Auma's foundation empowering children and families in that community, and see how these Kenyans -- half a world away -- feel about Obama's return \"home.\"\nThrough our days on the ground, I discovered that our opportunity with Auma would also provide a rare window into the Obama family. She is easily the closest sibling to the President (and as a result, she is fiercely private and protective of her family).\nShe shared stories with me about what it feels like when she returns to her ancestral home of Nyang'oma Kogelo, where, seven years after her brother arrived in the White House, many little boys are now named \"Barack Obama.\"\nObama: 'I'm the first Kenyan-American to be president'\nAuma took us to her family homestead and introduced me to \"Mama Sarah,\" the 93-year-old grandmother to Auma and Barack. Auma even walked me to her father's grave, where she shared with me in almost a whisper what she believes her father -- if he were still alive -- would say to his son, the President of the United States.\nJUST WATCHED CNN Exclusive: Meet Obama's Kenyan family Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nCNN Exclusive: Meet Obama's Kenyan family 09:04 I left West Kenya pensive, the theme of \"home\" starting to tug at me. What does \"home\" really mean? Is it merely geography, where you were born? Could it include straddling two continents and cultures? Or perhaps it's a place with a spiritual magnetism -- a feeling toward a culture or people -- that's tough to put into words?\nAnd that feeling brings me to the final leg of my Kenyan journey: the Masai Mara (or the \"Mara,\" as the locals call it), a vast national reserve in southwestern Kenya.\nIf you time your visit just right, you get to witness the Great Migration, the crossing of hundreds of thousands of gazelles, wildebeests, zebras and impala from Tanzania's Serengeti into Kenya's Mara, seeking fresh grass, food and water. Animals seeking a new home ...\nOur guide, Joseph Koyie, took us immediately on our first game drive. Not two minutes into our adventure, his well-attuned eye spotted a lioness in the distance.\nOnly, it was slinking our way. As in, at one point, this beautiful creature (with mighty large teeth) was crouched 2 feet from our vehicle. I froze.\nJoseph whispered, \"Don't move. S .\"\nI couldn't help it; my hand went for my friend's arm, and I SQUEEZED. Hard. \"Ohmygosh ohmygosh ohmygosh ... it's. Right. There!\" For the next 30 minutes, we sat absolutely transfixed.\nWe watched the lioness creep up on a warthog, which Joseph explained she had been eyeing from afar for lunch (lions are known for their keen eye sight and patience).\nBut the nearby impalas were on lookout and perhaps sent a signal to this little warthog, and the next thing we knew, the lioness was left alone and still hungry.\nOver the course of the next two days, I saw elephants, entire families of them. I also saw many giraffes -- my other favorite animal on safari -- cutting such a stunning silhouette in the distance. Their long, regal necks and those eyelashes!\nI watched lions sleeping in trees. I listened to the calls between wildebeests. At dusk on our drive back in, I even caught a glimpse of the rarest of all: a black rhino. Here I was, in their home.\nAnd the Maasai people? They're known for their beadwork, their colorful dress (red is their signature color), the men's bent-leg stance, their strength, endurance and nomadic lifestyle. You never ask a Maasai warrior how many cattle he has; it's like asking someone how much money they've got in their bank account.\nBut it was the Maasai singing in their own tribal language -- welcome songs, songs for children, warrior songs -- that I marveled at, as this tradition has managed to survive centuries, despite the modernization of Africa even in remote parts like the Mara.\nTo hear and see them, and in particular the men, chant and jump was mesmerizing. But what I really came to appreciate: the modern Maasai who prioritize education.\nThey leave their villages for 21st-century jobs, but they almost always return home. Just like Joseph, our safari guide, they continue to give back, never forgetting their roots, their home.\nThe Masai Mara may not be my physical home. Nyang'oma Kogelo may not be my home. Kilimanjaro may not be my home. But home, for me, is not just a place but a feeling.\nThe warmth of Mama Sarah's house, the traditional villages of the Maasai, the unequaled view from Uhuru Peak: I have discovered, in opening my eyes and heart to these new experiences, I am always welcomed home.\nObamamania sweeps Kenya as resourceful businesses cash in on visit", "external_links":
