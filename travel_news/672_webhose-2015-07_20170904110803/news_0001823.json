What can you afford? A box at Lord's during the Ashes Test may be beyond you, but that doesn’t mean SMEs can’t associate themselves with some pretty high-profile events. “For under five figures you can get a box for 20 people at the start of the British Touring Car Championship, for example,” says Nigel Jones, managing director of sports marketing and sponsorship expert The Purple Tangerine. Alternatively, if your customers are primarily local, sponsoring a good local amateur team can bring immense satisfaction and lots of goodwill at a bargain price. Can you think outside the pitch? Football, rugby, cricket and motorsport may be obvious targets, but there are plenty of other sports that might provide considerable exposure for a reasonable price. Approved Garages, the umbrella organisation for a national network of independent garage businesses, was one of the sponsors of this year’s Betway Premier League Darts. “It was a good fit for us,” says network manager Phil Seymour. “There were a lot of great nights out for our members and their clients, and it was also wonderful exposure for the brand. Not many people realise that a big darts event can attract thousands of people to the arena and hundreds of thousands more watch it on television.” What do you hope to achieve? Sports sponsorship can certainly spread brand awareness, but its most immediate benefit is often in its ability to impress clients and potential business customers. If you sell to other businesses, a day out at a match or race can be a deal clincher. “If you’re a small business targeting business to business, then you want sponsorship that enables you to entertain clients and customers,” says Mr Jones. “So the hospitality side of it is very important.” Does the sport add to your brand? Sport can say something positive about your brand and business, if you pick the right one. For example, Kent-based tech business Netbox Digital has sponsored British Touring Car Championship racing driver Tom Ingram and his team, Speedworks Motorsport. The fast-growing, high-tech business sees a mirror of itself in the speed and efficiency of motorsport. Meanwhile, cheese maker Cricketer Farm, located in the Quantock Hills, has sponsored Somerset Cricket Club, with the sedate summer spectacle reflecting the wholesome, classically English values of the brand. “Somerset Cricket Club’s sense of community, combined with the club attracting a very relevant target audience for our products, really appealed to us,” says MD Greg Parsons. How do you make the most of it? If you spend money on sponsorship you want to make the most of it and there's plenty of options, especially if your partnership agreement includes free tickets and access to players. “We created a whole PR campaign around the sponsorship,” says Mr Seymour. “As well as having our logo and literature at the events, we ran ticket competitions in local and social media, live-tweeted matches and dedicated a section of our website to player interviews and news. In effect we became part of the darts family.” Cricketer Farm used its partner privilege to directly target potential customers. “At our first event we gave out more than 1,500 samples of our Cheeky Cow half-fat cheese and hundreds of money-off vouchers. So, not only have thousands of our core target audience now tried our cheese, but we can also directly track redemption rates at stores selling the product,” says Mr Parsons. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Top seedfunding tips for SMEs • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office • Five of the best bookkeeping apps for SMEs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:49:45.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
