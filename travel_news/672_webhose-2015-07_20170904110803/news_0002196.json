Humidity will remain uncomfortable for most. \nTrue relief from the heat will come after that front swings through by midweek. \n\"Some places are experiencing their hottest conditions of 2015 from the weekend into early this week, so the sharp frontal passage forecast to occur on Tuesday will bring welcomed relief,\" stated AccuWeather Meteorologist Ben Noll. \nWhile the threat will be monitored, widespread severe weather is not expected to accompany Tuesday's cold front. \n\"The change in the weather will be quite noticeable on Wednesday across much of the Northeast as humidity lessens considerably, though a shower or two cannot be ruled out in northern New England,\" continued Noll. \nHigh temperatures on Wednesday will also be back to more typical mid-July highs. Residents, especially in New England, may opt to give their air conditioners and fans a break. \nIt will actually be several days before those air conditioners and fans are needed again, according to Noll. \n\"The break from the excessive heat and humidity will probably linger into next weekend before another frontal boundary approaches,\" he stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:21:10.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
