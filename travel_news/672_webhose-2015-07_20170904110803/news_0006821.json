The airline is currently in a dispute with Washington over flights it operates to the US using aircraft registered in Ireland.\nAn application for a permanent licence has been fiercely contested by some parts of the industry . They claim the main reason for the move is to bypass Norway’s strict labour laws, avoiding high labour costs and enabling it to employ cheaper workers.\nKjos voiced confidence that the airline will get the green light “sooner or later” for its Irish arm to operate flights to the US.\n“The US airlines hate Norwegian because we are flying with low fares,” he told The FT . “They are trying to protect their turf by all means.\"\nThe airline's plans follow an announcement that it is to lunch a new four-times weekly route to Boston from Gatwick in May 2016.\nThis will be in addition to the introduction of a Puerto Rico service from Gatwick from November and daily flights to New York from October.\nThe airline said more than 200,000 passengers had flown on its low-cost transatlantic flights to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale in the past year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/686fa236-2589-11e5-bd83-71cb60e8f08c.html#axzz3fNyZY200"], "published": "2015-07-09T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T20:49:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
