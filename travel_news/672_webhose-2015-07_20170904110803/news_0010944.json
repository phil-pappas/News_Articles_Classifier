It’s great to experiment with simple, fresh ingredients and focus on lighter, more colourful creations. I’ve been playing around a lot with new salads and this roasted almond and blueberry salad is my absolute favourite. It tastes incredible served alongside a big bowl of courgetti tossed in a creamy, minted cashew pesto and then followed by a ginger, cacao and summer berry crumble. The three dishes together really make for the perfect summer dinner party menu, and if you don’t want to do it all veggie then some grilled fish would work well alongside these. • Deliciously Ella: how to go gluten-free naturally The roasted almond and blueberry salad is inspired by a café I visited when I was in Dublin a few months ago. I’d never thought of mixing blueberries and goji berries together in a salad, but I loved the sweet element they added and found that they worked even better mixed with tender squash, which really melts in your mouth, meaning that all the ingredients blend together perfectly. They’re then tossed with thin pieces of courgette and fresh rocket, to boost your intake of greens, and mixed with a sweet tahini dressing made of apple cider vinegar, honey, tahini, lemon juice and olive oil. It’s a very simple salad but it looks vibrant and beautiful and tastes amazing! It’s also easy to prepare if you’re short on time. Ella using her spiralizer (CLARE WINFIELD) The salad tastes wonderful served with anything from bowls of quinoa to baked potatoes and trays of roasted veggies, but I’ve found it goes especially well with some creamy courgetti. Courgetti is so popular at the moment – I seem to keep seeing it everywhere I go – but for anyone who hasn’t come across it I thought I should quickly explain what it is: spiralized courgettes (made using a spiralizer machine) that look and taste very similar to spaghetti. It’s great as a pasta alternative if you’re looking for something lighter, or as a base for salads, instead of always using green leaves. I love serving it with creamy sauces like this minted cashew pesto, which is a blend of pine nuts, cashews, mint, avocado, garlic, lemon and olive oil. The pesto is beautifully rich and indulgent thanks to the avocado, but using veggies rather than cheese to thicken it means it’s still wonderfully light. The pesto courgetti tastes equally good hot or cold, so if you’re craving something warmer and more comforting simply heat the dish up for a few minutes in a frying pan before serving. Ella's ginger, cacao and berry crumble (CLARE WINFIELD) In the summer I serve crumbles for pudding at almost every dinner I prepare. I love how quick and easy they are; they always come out perfectly and everyone adores them! You just can’t go wrong with a good crumble. They’re also a great dish to serve to friends and family who aren’t sure about healthy eating yet, because you can’t really tell the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy version. Instead of butter I use coconut oil and instead of sugar I use maple syrup. I then use a blend of cacao powder, ginger, vanilla and almond butter, which are mixed with the oats to add extra flavour. Together, the ingredients make for the most delicious crumble topping. • Deliciously Ella: crash diets don't work, just eat sensibly As it’s summer, I love using a mix of berries alongside sweet red apples for the fruit layer; it makes the crumble taste fresher and more summery than using fruit such as pears and raisins, which are my regular go-to’s in the winter. The other fantastic thing about crumble is that you can make extra and eat the leftovers for breakfast. It makes for the simplest breakfast and I find that it gets even more delicious after a few days in the fridge. For pudding I serve it with vanilla ice cream – although, of course, I use one made out of cashew nuts – but for breakfast it’s amazing with a little coconut yogurt.
