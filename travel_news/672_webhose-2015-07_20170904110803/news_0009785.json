That’s the idea of the Shower Gel in a Sponge , which is good for at least three washings. \nA company called Spongeables makes a whole line of these things, with the larger ones designed to hold enough for 20 showers. These little ones that fit in the palm of your hand are great for travel though, especially if you’re going to be in a cheap hotel with nasty soap. You can carry one of these lightweight packages along, a solid that is also well less than 3 ounces, and breeze through security without even taking it out. But then you can be nice to your skin when you shower, coming out radiant and smooth. \nI’m not sure how they get all these ingredients in there and make it work—there are a bunch of patents involved—but I was pleasantly surprised at how long this little bath sponge lathered up. After six showers I probably could have used it another time or two. Each one has shea butter, olive oil, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and a few other ingredients, plus your choice of girly or manly scent. After using this Spongeable, you are clean, moisturized, exfoliated, and fragrant. \nThese shower sponges would make for a nice gift for the traveler of any kind and are inexpensive and small enough to qualify as a stocking stuffer. They list for just $3 each in the small size (a buck or less a bath) and the largest ones are $7. You can even get some heart-shaped ones come Valentine’s Day—in “spicy mango” or “peony passion.” \nBuy the Spongeables online or see the company’s retail locator for where they are carried—common chain stores like Rite-Aid, Albertson’s, Fred Meyer, and CVS. \nSee more at spongeables.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:56:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
