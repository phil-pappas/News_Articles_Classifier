We’re pathetic really compared with the US,” he told the ABC this week.\nHe said about $250 million was available in venture capital for young entrepreneurs each year. This was about 20 times less than what taxpayers spent subsidising investment properties, which do not create jobs.\n“We currently give $4 billion a year to investors via the tax system to subsidise people buying negatively geared rental accommodation,” he told news.com.au.\nMr Ries said Australia was basically a country that subsidised nonproductive capital.\n“If someone borrows money to buy residential property, it doesn’t create any jobs,” he said.\n“We’re giving already well-off people subsidies to buy more property, whereas the country in total spends $250 million a year on venture capital. There’s something wrong with that balance.”\nIt also meant that Australia was basically “exporting jobs”.\n“It just means there will be less jobs here in the longer term. We’re just exporting jobs at the moment,” he said.\nThe money spent on venture capital was even less than the $1 billion Australians spent buying luxury sports utility vehicles (SUVs) every year. A high proportion of these vehicles will be used as private cars but written off as a business asset, which the taxpayer pays for.\n“The reality of life in Australia today is we subsidise people buying high-end SUVs but we don’t give as much to venture capital,” Mr Ries said.\nMr Ries said the tax system should be tilted back towards things that actually created wealth and jobs. He saw at least two businesses a week that had developed some fantastic technology but could not get funding.\nAttractive: More money goes towards buying luxury SUVs than venture capital in Australia.

So we’re not just losing jobs, we’re actually losing future government revenue,” Mr Ries said.\nHe said more tax concessions should be made available.\n“I think the government needs to make it much more attractive to invest in these things which, by their nature, are much more risky,” he told news.com.au.\n“Nine out of 10 of them will fail but the one that succeeds will often be hugely successful.”\nThe Australian Government needs to make sure investing in start-ups such as Facebook are more attractive. Source: AP\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said on Wednesday that Australia’s future prosperity would depend on raising the economy’s growth potential.\n“Our collective ability to deliver social policy outcomes, to enjoy the benefits of a good society, or at a more basic level to provide public services and even to defend ourselves, ultimately rests on a productive economy,” he said.\n“We all know that competitive markets, investment in education, skills and infrastructure, and adaptability, are key parts of that growth narrative.”\nOriginally published as ‘We’re pathetic in comparison’", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-high-cost-of-australias-housing-obsession/story-fnu2pwk8-1227457463991", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/460465-bd493a96-31ce-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/463319-040ee1bc-31cd-11e5-9ab0-19db9af17447.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-27T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:21:44.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
