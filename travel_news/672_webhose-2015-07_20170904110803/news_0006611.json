Food Network used to be just people in their fake kitchens making food for the camera. Now it seems that everything is a competition show or a run down of chefs favorite places to eat. Not that those aren’t fun, I just miss being able to watch someone cook a meal and not worry about the time running out before they could finish. \nEmeril, Barefoot Contessa, The Naked Chef, Sweet Dreams, How To Boil Water, and most of all Good Eats with Alton Brown on Netflix . And Good Eats is now on Netflix for everyone to see. I remember loving how Alton Brown married science and delicious food into one great show. He explained how brownies and cakes are different, how yeast effects your bread, and that the cinnamon we eat isn’t actually cinnamon. He made science and cooking fun and interesting. \nI showed an episode of Good Eats to Shae to introduce her to my favorite show. We watched Alton make cinnamon rolls from scratch and both of us were instantly craving some. We decided to make some from his recipe for breakfast one day. However, it was a two day recipe so we would have to wait until the next morning to enjoy our delicious buns. \nIt was definitely the most involved recipe I’ve ever made. I prepared the dough myself and then let it rest all day. After dinner we mixed up our filling and rolled out our dough on the counter. It wasn’t perfect but we kept going. We spread the filling over the dough and slowly and carefully, we rolled it up. Then we sliced up the buns and put them in the pan. We had to leave them in the fridge overnight but in the morning, we were ready to bake and consume. It wasn’t perfect but we kept going.

They needed to proof with some hot water in the oven before we could bake. Waiting was torture, the buns were so close to being ready. Finally, we could bake them. We waited not so patiently for them to be ready. While we waited, I made the icing. We pulled out a delicious and beautiful pan of cinnamon rolls. \nThank you Netflix and Alton Brown for such a delicious breakfast. 1 Flares Facebook 0 Google+ 0 StumbleUpon 0 Pin It Share 0 Twitter 1 1 Flares × ← Top   About Melinda \nMelinda is half of the mom & dad blogging team from LookWhatMomFound...and Dad too!
