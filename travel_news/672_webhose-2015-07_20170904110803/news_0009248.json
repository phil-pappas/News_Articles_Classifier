Credit Jack Parsons \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At roughly 7,000 feet above sea level, Santa Fe , N.M., offers visitors a culturally diverse experience, steeped in the history of the American West. The relatively dry climate (with cool mornings and nights) and above-average air quality attract many outdoor enthusiasts to the area, which has nearly 1.5 million acres of national forest. With a compact downtown dominated by pueblo-style architecture and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the background, Santa Fe has preserved its inviting, small-town feel. Don Pedro de Peralta, a Spanish conquistador who later became governor-general of New Mexico, established the present-day location of the city from 1609 to 1610. As a result, Santa Fe is the oldest capital city in the United States, despite New Mexico’s relatively young statehood. (The state was admitted to the Union in 1912 , ahead of only Arizona, Alaska and Hawaii.) Fernanda Santos, chief of the Phoenix bureau of The New York Times, occasionally finds herself in the area when reporting in the American Southwest. When arriving in Santa Fe from Albuquerque, one can generally choose between Interstate 25, roughly an hour’s drive, and State Route 14, a National Scenic Byway also known as the Turquoise Trail . “The Turquoise Trail is a gem,” Ms. Santos said. “The road goes up and down and around the mountains, crossing old mining towns like Madrid, whose shops sell beautiful pottery, paintings and American Indian jewelry for less than you’d buy them in Santa Fe. One spot I love is Conley Studio Pottery, which features work from several New Mexican artists.” Conley Studio Pottery, owned by the Madrid resident Lisa Conley, is a gallery that features items like Navajo and local Cerrillos turquoise jewelry from regional artists (and includes pottery by the owner). A local cafe on State Route 14 in Madrid that makes chocolate pastries with Bing cherries, pink peppercorn and cashews, among other ingredients, also gets strong approval from Ms. Santos. “For a treat, I recommend Shugarman’s Little Chocolate Shop . Its handmade organic chocolates are decadent,” she said. A short drive up State Route 14 from Madrid is Cerrillos, home of the Turquoise Trail Sculpture Garden and Studio . The garden uses rock formations and the natural Southwest setting to promote harmonious sensibilities. The current exhibit is “Origami in the Garden,” which Ms. Santos said is great for family outings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T18:31:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
