contract boiler makers and pipe fitters have been let go from Osborne shipbuilders ASC this morning.\nWork is winding down on the Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) project and there are no other major projects in the pipeline as the state waits on a decision on the Future Submarines, creating the so-called Valley of Death.\nDefence Industries Minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said the latest ASC job losses highlighted the perilious situation facing naval shipbuilding in Australia.\nMore than 500 jobs had been cut nationally this year as the Federal Government decided whether to build the next generation of submarines within Australia or overseas.\n“This news is extremely disappointing for the workers and their families,” said Mr Hamilton-Smith.\n“Federal Government indecision on defence procurement is causing job losses at Melbourne-based BAE Systems Australia, Newcastle based Forgacs and Adelaide based ASC.”\nMr Hamilton-Smith said the job losses within domestic naval shipbuilding underlined the need for the right decisions to be made in Canberra about submarines and surface ships.\n“The Federal Government must provide Australia’s defence industry with clarity and immediately rule out an overseas or hybrid build,” he said.\n“South Australia is the centre for excellence in naval shipbuilding, underpinned by our highly skilled workers.\n“Our next generation of submarines and Future Frigates must be built in Australia, by Australian workers, to defend Australia.”\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has said he will soon announce a plan to restructure shipbuilding in Australia to remove the gaps between projects and to avoid further layoffs.\n“This announcement must include a firm commitment to back Australia’s naval shipbuilding capabilities and to support Australian workers and their families, small business and defence industries,” Mr Hamilton-Smith said.\n“What we need now from the Federal Government is the delivery of a 30-year continuous strategic ship building plan for Australia to rescue an industry which is hanging on for survival.”\n“$250 billion worth of naval shipbuilding work is at stake over the next 30 years.\n“Economic modelling shows that there are 120,000 man-years of work at risk if the Federal Government decides to send the submarine build overseas.\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union said it was worried about the remaining 2500 ASC workers.\n“By failing to place orders for new navy ships, (Prime Minister Tony Abbott) is running down the workforce and as those workers move off to other industries, their expertise will be lost,” SA Assistant Secretary Colin Fenney said.\nIn a statement, ASC said the job losses were the result of efficiency gains in the AWD program.\n“On the basis of continuous improvement, ASC is making enhancements to the way it undertakes production activities, including changing the sequencing of work,” it said.\n“Whilst the change in sequencing will lead to efficiency gains during the entire construction timeline for each chip, it means at this stage of the build, the nature of the work to be performed is incompatible with the level of production contractors on site.\n“Accordingly 101 labour hire contractors have been advised today that their positions on the AWD program are no longer required.\n“This contractor management activity is normal practise for projects of this nature and has, and will, occur several times over the life of the project.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T06:06:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle":
