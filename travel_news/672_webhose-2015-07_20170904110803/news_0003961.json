One Colorado man is doing that, but it wasn’t on purpose.\nIn an interview with ABC News , Colorado Springs resident Mark Rantal talked about what he has been eating for lunch for more than 100 days -- Chipotle. (For the record, it's been 107 days, according to People.com. )\nBut it wasn’t a challenge -- Rantal said that it just happened by chance and he decided to keep doing it once he began to hit milestones.\n“The whole thing was totally an accident. On Monday, I decided to get Chipotle and on Tuesday I made the same decision, then got lunch with my friend there on Wednesday,” Rantal said. “We laughed about it at lunch and he asked how long I thought I could go. And that began the thought.”\nHe added that he always gets the same meal: a burrito bowl with white rice, pinto beans, fajitas, sofritas, mild salsa, corn, medium salsa, cheese, and lettuce.\n“For me, food is one of those things as fuel instead of celebration. I’ve just never really gotten so into it,” he said. “It became so convenient of you know where you’re going, you know the friendly faces of the staff, you know you enjoy the meal and you know you’re going to get the calories.”\nABC News reported that Rantal has also developed relationships with the staff at his local Chipotle restaurant, which in turn leads to them giving him a free meal coupon every 10 times.\nNow on day 107, Rantal has become a small sensation over the Internet, even doing a Reddit AMA about his experience, but that doesn’t mean he is actively trying to hit the one-year mark. “The (one-year) milestone isn’t appealing enough to have to put in the effort, but there is a tiny wistful part of me that just thinks, ‘Wouldn’t it be hilarious to be the guy who ate Chipotle for a year?’ But I don’t know if I want to be that guy,” he said.\nRead more at ABC News .\nTrending on Facebook\nShark attacks Australian surfer on live TV Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert are getting divorced Justin Timberlake and Alfonso Ribeiro do \"The Carlton\" Diner owner under Facebook fire for yelling at screaming child 5-year-old dressed as Batman rescues baby locked in hot car More popular and trending stories\n</p", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/meet-guy-eaten-chipotle-103-days-counting/story?id=32522982", "http://greatideas.people.com/2015/07/20/man-eats-chipotle-100-days/?xid=socialflow_facebook_peoplemag", "https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3dezm7/ive_eaten_chipotle_101_days_in_a_row_ask_me/"], "published": "2015-07-22T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T00:10:23.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
