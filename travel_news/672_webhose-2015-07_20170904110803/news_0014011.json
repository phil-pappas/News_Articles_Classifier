He lives in Jerusalem, Israel and wants to kill gays. \nIn 2005 at a Gay pride parade in Jerusalem he got to action the first time and was sentenced to 12 years in prison by an Israeli court. \nThree days ago he paid his time to society and was released ready to do it again. Today and just three days after his release from prison he went to a Gay Pride parade again. After he was done, two people are in serious condition in a Jerusalem hospital. \nEyewitnesses told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that the attacker emerged behind marchers and began stabbing them while screaming, before being tackled by a police officer. \nHis name is Yishai Schlissel, an ultra-Orthodox Jew. There was immense panic and shock and people started running in every direction. \nIsraelis are known to be resilient people. The parade continued after the wounded were taken to a hospital, with protesters chanting \"end the violence\". \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attack contradicted the country's \"basic values\". He continued in a statement \"In the state of Israel the individual's freedom of choice is one of basic values. We must ensure that in Israel, every man and woman lives in security in any way they choose. That's how we acted in the past and how we'll continue to act. I wish the wounded a speedy recovery,\" \nHundreds of police are deployed along the parade route to prevent violence breaking out. Ultra-Orthodox Jews have previously gathered in the city's Mea Shearim quarter to protest against homosexuality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T22:30:14.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
