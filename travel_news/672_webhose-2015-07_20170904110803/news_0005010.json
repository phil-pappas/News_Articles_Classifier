I cycle everywhere, so I get to the gym in time to have a coffee and maybe write a programme before my first class or client at 7am. Meals normally have to fit round my work. I’m vegan and I try to prepare all my food in advance. So around 9am, I have a late breakfast of chia seeds, goji berries, nuts, oats and some protein powder that’s been soaking in coconut milk overnight. That keeps me going until lunch at 2pm or 3pm. I’ll use the gym when it’s quiet, maybe doing a workout with a friend or lifting weights on my own Then I’ll have something like steamed kale with roasted broccoli, asparagus, mushrooms and aubergines, with rice or quinoa, and maybe tofu. I make a big batch of it on a Sunday. I fit my own training around that of my clients, and I’ll use the gym when it’s quiet – maybe doing a workout with a friend or lifting weights on my own. Often I don’t leave work until 8pm, so when I get in I might have some soup, watch an episode of something before having a bath, stretching or listening to chilled music. I socialise at weekends, but during the week, I’m focused on work so I tend to be in bed by 10pm. • Daisy Rusby works as a trainer and instructor at Gymbox, and specialises in kettle bells, suspension training and primal movement.
