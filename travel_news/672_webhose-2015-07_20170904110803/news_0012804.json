Their investment interests were wide and varied ranging from oil and gas, agri-business, tourism, marine and infrastructure projects.\n“There is a lot of follow up now being undertaken with an interagency working group being put together to progress the enormous opportunity this represents for the future of the Northern Territory.”\nMr Styles said the Northern Territory zone safari park proposal in China presented an exciting tourism opportunity.\nThe proposal followed meetings in Guangzhou and Zhuhai with high ranking China businessman Mr Su Zhigang the head of Chime Long Group Co Ltd.\n“Mr Su is the principal and founder of Chimelong, a highly successful creator of world-class tourism projects within China,” the Asian Engagement Minister said.\n“This includes a tourism hub in Guangzhou that integrates theme parks, luxury hotels, a convention centre, high-quality restaurants and leisure entertainment centres, and more. They have recently established Ocean Kingdom, near Macau, a remarkable world-class tourism hub in China that has established world records for innovation in tourism.\n“Millions of Chinese tourists visit Chimelong facilities annually. The business model Chimelong has pursued with tourism is highly instructive and our talks centred on working with Chimelong to increase the relatively low percentage of Chinese tourists visiting the Northern Territory.\n“Chimelong gets around 80,000 people a day through its parks and it wants to work with us to design and build a unique Australia’s Northern Territory zone in its safari park that will carry distinctive regional animals, vegetation and an exhibition/education centre that showcases the Northern Territory’s natural environment and culture.\n“From the park we will be able to promote visitation to the Northern Territory . It’s an exciting proposition from a tourism market that is expected to explode in coming years.”\nMr Styles said the Northern Territory government scored other success in Guangzhou when he talked to 100 investors at an NT forum held as part of the annual Guangzhou International Investment and Trade expo.\n“As a result of this we are now in discussions with potential investors from Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai, who see the Territory as a place they want to do business with.\n“It was a similar story in Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia where Darwin is the topic of discussion because of China’s new focus on the modern maritime Silk Road trade route which starts in Xian and ends at Darwin.\n“Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s White Paper on Australia’s development of the north could not have come at a better time for my regional visit because it was front and centre in the minds of investors.\n“The Giles Government will now be working tirelessly to bring as many of these potential investors to the Territory as possible with a view to get them on board with Territory projects.”\nRelated Posts Territory investment delegation attends major international expo in China Hong Kong scraps unlimited-entry visa for Shenzhen hitting iPhone trade Darwin to host Australia-Taiwan Joint Conference Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Northern Territory taps on food tourism to attract visitors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T01:19:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
