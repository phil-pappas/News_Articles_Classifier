A video posted by First Lady Michelle Obama (@michelleobama) on Jul 1, 2015 at 4:47am PDT \nThe White House is encouraging people to post images of stops on the tour - such as the Red Room, East Room and State Dining Room - on social media with the hashtag #WhiteHouseTour. \nWhile cameras are now permitted on the tours, so-called \"selfie sticks\" remain banned, as are cameras with lenses longer than 3 inches. \nTourists were greeted by the video as they entered the White House on Wednesday. They pulled out smartphones and digital cameras as they passed photos of the Obamas and signs reading, \"PHOTOGRAPHY IS ENCOURAGED\". Some visitors posted instantly to Snapchat and Instagram, while others wanted to send the photos back home. \"I'm gonna share this with everybody,\" said Thomas Auanger, a visitor from Texas, after taking a selfie with his seven-year-old son, Jack, in front of a portrait of Ronald Reagan. \"I've taken pictures of every single thing since the first lady said we could,\" said Shari O'Connor, who was visiting from Boston. \"We're so excited,\" said Cinnia Kitterman of Boise, Idaho, who was celebrating her birthday with a White House tour with her husband and two sons. They saw a segment on the morning news about the end of the photo restrictions, so they brought their camera, she said. \"This president has allowed so many more freedoms for our country,\" Kitterman said.

It did not have an exact date for when the rule took effect, but said changes in flash photography led officials to lift it. \nHowever, some cameras and accessories such as so-called selfie sticks are still banned, along with video cameras, cameras with detachable lenses, tablets, tripods and monopods, the White House said. \nPhone cameras and compact still cameras with a lens no longer than 3 inches (7.6 cm) are allowed, it said. A photo posted by Adam Gallagher (@iamgalla) on Jul 1, 2015 at 4:18pm PDT \nA relaxation of the camera rule coincided with a new security measure surrounding the executive mansion on Wednesday: a spiked top fence to thwart would-be intruders. Ad Feedback \nSharp metal points will be bolted on top of the black iron fence as a temporary measure until authorities put up a more permanent structure next year. The change was sparked by security breaches at the White House, including a September intrusion when a man scaled the fence and ran into the mansion. \nThe Secret Service has enforced the ban in the past to protect the president from potential security breaches. \nThe public tours, which must be requested through a member of Congress or White House officials, allow visitors to see the East Wing and West Wing of the building. \nReuters, Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:03:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
