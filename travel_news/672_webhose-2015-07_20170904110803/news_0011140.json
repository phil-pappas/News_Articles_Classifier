George worked in Republican Gov. John Kasich’s (KAY’-sik’s) administration and represented the governor on the advisory board that oversees Statehouse operations.\nKasich and wife Karen also attended the wedding as did several other top Republicans.\nKasich believes marriage is between a man and woman but declared the court’s ruling must be respected.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
