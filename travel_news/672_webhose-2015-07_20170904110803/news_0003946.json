Today, Downtown thoroughfare Fremont Street bustles with brand-new bars, restaurants, shops, venues, and hotels offering budget-friendly, intimate, and down-to-earth accommodations that sometimes outdo their Strip counterparts. \nBonus: All six of the hip hot spots and historic mainstays below provide free parking, easy access to the North Premium Outlets mall , and a firsthand view of a side of the city that's making a comeback in a big way.
