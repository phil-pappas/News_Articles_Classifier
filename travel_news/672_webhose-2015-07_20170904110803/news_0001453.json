This is why water is necessary for Taj Mahal’s survival. So if the water levels in the Yamuna are receding, then it needs to be brought up. The Indian government and the Archaeological Survey of India need to pay attention to this. The Taj Mahal must be preserved according to the estimates of the ancient architects,” said Tahir in Agra.\nAn official at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in-charge of preserving the monument, however denied existence of any scientific evidence supporting the historian’s claims.\n“It is an opinion that there is a direct relationship between the water in the Yamuna river and the strength of the Taj Mahal’s foundations. But there is no scientific proof to back this view,” said Bhuvan Vikram Singh, ASI Superintendent, Agra.\nHe, however, admitted that pollutants arising out of Yamuna pose an actual threat to the mausoleum’s semi-precious white marble.\nSingh added that conclusions on the possible threats to the monument’s foundation may be drawn only after collecting evidence on the same.\nFor the last few decades, the Taj Mahal has been under threat due to alarming levels of pollution from river Yamuna and the industries in Agra.\n 08, 2015 8:42 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:16:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
