This is more widely available than when it was first introduced in the U.S. last year, Reuters noted. \nHow it works is that users can pair a credit or debit card to the Apple Pay account and then touch the iPhone against a card reader. The purchase is then approved with the fingerprint. \nEventually, Apple Pay will be supported by all major British banks, as Apple states that the payment system ensures higher level of security than most other electronic payment methods, Reuters said. \n\"When you're using Apple Pay in a store restaurant or other merchant, cashiers will no longer see your name, credit card number or security code, helping to reduce the potential for fraud,\" senior VP of Apple's Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue said. \nSeparately, the company's Apple TV, or its \"cable-killer TV app\" may finally be ready, as talks with major broadcast networks are rapidly gaining momentum, the New York Post reports. Apple TV allows local live TV feeds to be streamed on any Apple device. \nOn Tuesday morning, shares are declining 0.16% to $125.46. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although the company may harbor some minor weaknesses, we feel they are unlikely to have a significant impact on results.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Powered by its strong earnings growth of 40.36% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 25.87% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, AAPL should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. APPLE INC has improved earnings per share by 40.4% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, APPLE INC increased its bottom line by earning $6.43 versus $5.66 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.03 versus $6.43). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has greatly exceeded that of the S&P 500, but is less than that of the Computers & Peripherals industry average. The net income increased by 32.7% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $10,223.00 million to $13,569.00 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 32.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 27.1%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. Current return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. When compared to other companies in the Computers & Peripherals industry and the overall market, APPLE INC's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500.
