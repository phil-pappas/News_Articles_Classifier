At Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort, guests can take advantage of the Resort’s amazing pool offerings, including a five-acre (two hectare) waterpark called Explorer Island. There’s no ticket required – and the expansive water offerings are guaranteed fun for all ages. Exclusively for Resort guests, the five pool areas at Four Seasons Orlando include:\nThe Explorer Pool: Ideal for families, The Explorer Pool features 7,590 square-feet (705-square-metres) of splashing fun, overlooking the lake and offering a gradually sloping “zero entry” that is ideal for the littlest swimmers. An underwater audio system plays favourite hits. The Explorer Pool also has a toddler slide, and is surrounded by daybeds and deck chairs. In addition, a highlight of The Explorer Pool is the “Starstruck” movie screen, which is a 190-inch flat-screen that plays family movies for guests every Thursday and Saturday nights throughout summer. Children can float around in tubes while watching the movie or lounge on one of the chaises while enjoying complimentary popcorn. Several cabanas are also available by the Explorer Pool (for a fee). Every day, the complimentary Kids For All Seasons program for kids ages four and older offers supervised swimming at 11:00 am and 4:00 pm.\nThe Oasis: The Oasis is the lakeside, infinity-edge adult-only pool. Bordered by lush landscaping including tall cypress trees overlooking the sparkling lake, this pristine pool is 92 feet long (28 metres) and is also equipped with underwater audio. An adult-only whirlpool is perfect for relaxing. Guests at The Oasis enjoy regular amenities from the pool staff, such as frozen fruit, sunglasses cleaning, Evian spritzes, iced cappuccino shooters, and more. The adult-only pool also offers cabanas (for a fee).\nThe Drifters: The Resort’s Lazy River is unlike any in the area – with amazing landscaping, it’s like one is in the midst of a tropical rainforest while gently tubing down the winding river. At 11,008 square-feet (1,023 square metres), Drifters takes one through a cascading 9-foot (2.75 metre) waterfall and a bubbling rapids section. Water cannons are strategically placed along various points on the river, enabling young ones to enjoy a laugh when taking Mom or Dad by surprise with a spray of cool water. At the end of Drifters, there’s an area called “the Cove” featuring a water basketball hoop and a water volleyball net. The Cove has hanging wicker pod chairs that the tween set love to lounge in. Adjacent to The Hideout, a video gaming centre with fun family entertainment from pinball to classic board games to billiards, The Cove is a great gathering spot.\nThe Drop: Both the young (and young-at-heart) love the two 242-foot (74-metre) waterslides. The blue slide is enclosed for a thrilling drop with a big splash, while the yellow is open and made from see-through fiberglass. The Kids For All Seasons team often offers timed races down the slides, adding to the fun.\nThe Splash Zone: Ideal for wee ones, the Splash Zone is a spacious area offering choreographed interactive fountains that launch blasts of water 30 feet (9 metres) into the air. Sheets of water, fog nozzles, dancing water spouts, and more make this area especially fun for the pre-school set. Daybeds and white teepees with brightly coloured cushions surround the Splash Zone and provide the perfect spot for toddlers to enjoy a rest in the shade.\nSource:-Four Seasons\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Melia Hotels International becomes a partner of the World Community Grid, initiative sponsored by IBM Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Jumeirah Creekside Hotel raises the bar on sustainability standards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T10:08:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
