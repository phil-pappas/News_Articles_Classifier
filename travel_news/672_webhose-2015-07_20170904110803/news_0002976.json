While many tropical systems tend to form from disturbances moving westward off the coast of Africa, a small number can form in the vicinity of a stalled front over warm water. \nThis area of concern stretches from Gulf of Mexico waters, west of Florida, to Atlantic Ocean coastal waters from northeast of Florida to Georgia and the Carolinas. \nThe forecast broad area of disturbed weather could allow one or possibly two tropical systems to slowly organize in the coming days. \nAccording to AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski, \"Provided winds aloft remain light over this area, there could be an opportunity for tropical development.\" \nKottlowski pointed out that if a system were to develop off the southern Atlantic Coast of the U.S., then steering winds could take the system out to sea. \nIf a system were to develop on the Gulf side, steering winds could allow such a system meander westward along the upper Gulf coast. \nResidents and vacationers in the Gulf and Southeast should monitor the situation this weekend and into next week. \n\"Throughout the region of concern, water temperatures are sufficiently warm to support tropical development,\" Kottlowski said. \nEither system would tend to move slowly and could bring torrential rainfall to part of the Southeast coast. \nShould a system develop, then the risk of offshore seas, rough surf and strong rip currents will increase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T00:16:26.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
