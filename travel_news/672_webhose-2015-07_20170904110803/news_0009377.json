Port Columbus International Airport may be an eyesore for travelers of late, but ongoing renovations to the terminal are not hurting its operating results. Through six months of 2015, passenger traffic is soaring and the airport’s finances are trending ahead of budget projections and 2014 results, the Columbus Regional Airport Authority reported Tuesday. Travelers don’t appear to be opting for Cleveland, Cincinnati or Dayton because of the ongoing $80 million terminal modernization program that will wrap up in the first quarter next year. “We did not expect to lose traffic as a result of construction,” said David Whitaker , vice president of business development for the agency that oversees operations at Port Columbus. “There’s been some pain points of passenger flow - constrictions in reduced hallways - but both the airlines and our own construction teams know the end is near.” Through the first half of 2015, the airport authority, which also oversees Rickenbacker International Airport, recorded operating income of $15.2 million, trending 26 percent above a $12 million projection. That’s even as the agency recorded $89,000 less than expected on advertising because of walls being covered and torn down during construction. Recent construction efforts at Port Columbus, such as Concourse B and baggage claim renovations, have not prevented restaurants and shops from drawing customers, either. Revenue from those operations totaled $9.4 million, or $233,000 above the $9.1 million budgeted through June 30. Randy Bush , the authority's CFO, says sound finances ultimately come down to the number of people moving through the airport. “The demand that we have for air service is really driving a lot of our numbers,” Bush told me. \nWant Columbus Travel   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:59:02.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
