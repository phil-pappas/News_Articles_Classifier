LOUIS (AP) — The longtime movie critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch has died in a one-car accident. \nThe Post-Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1DIXAr9 ) reports that Joe Williams died Sunday night in Jefferson County, south of St. Louis. Williams, 56, was a graduate of the University of Missouri School of Journalism. He had been at the Post-Dispatch since 1997 and had been film critic since 2000. \n“Joe had a love of movies that was infectious,” said Jody Mitori, assistant managing editor for features. “He loved to watch them, talk about them and share his opinions about them. Readers — and his editors — looked forward to seeing what Joe thought of the latest releases and how he would write about the films he loved, and the ones he didn’t. \n“He was a gifted writer with a sharp wit and a generous spirit.” Most Read Stories \nWilliams, of Brentwood, was southbound on Highway 67 when he veered too far to the left, over-corrected and drove into a ditch on the right side of the highway, police said. His car came to a rest on its roof. \nThe crash remains under investigation. \nWilliams’ mother, Marie Williams, said she believes that her son was on his way to the Starlite Drive-In Theater in Cadet, Missouri. \n“He was the son I always wanted,” she said. “I was so proud of him.” \n___ \nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:28:23.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
