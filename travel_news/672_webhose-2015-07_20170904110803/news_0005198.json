Importantly, Athena’s partnership will entail agile customisation and time to market improvements. \n\nFrederic Barou, vice president, distribution products and operations, Amadeus Asia Pacific, said: “The middle and back offices are important and often complex aspects of a travel agency’s business. We are excited to partner with such an innovative company to provide a valuable addition to the Amadeus suite of agency solutions and more choice to our customers.” \n\nAthena Bookings is already available to travel agencies in Malaysia and will be made available to other markets progressively in the coming months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:50:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
