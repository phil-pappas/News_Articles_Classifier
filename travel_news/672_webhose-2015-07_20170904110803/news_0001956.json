The Sidewinder is directed by its own onboard systems to find, hopefully, its intended target. The pilot has no control over a Sidewinder after the trigger button is pushed.\nCommercial airliners are pretty much the same.\nOnce their aircraft leave the gate airline managers have no control over them. Airliners either make it to their intended destinations or they don’t, based on the actions of people and factors beyond the direct control of the airline’s executives, schedule planners and even its flight operations managers. Indeed, flight operations managers typically have no ability to even track or manage the position and performance of their planes in the air – not in real time, anyway.\nAirline operations managers today typically do have available to them near-real time data about where their planes are thanks to tracking data provided to them by the Federal Aviation Administration. But in all but the most rare cases, those operation managers do not have the software tools necessary in order to use what positioning data is available to them in order to actively track or manage the positions of their aircraft in the air. Thus the “fire and forget” analogy.\nOperations managers typically don’t concern themselves with the location of planes en route until that plane lands at its destination. They just assume it will get there. That explains how o perations managers at Malaysian Airlines did not know for more than an hour that Flight 370 had departed from its course back in March 2014. And it largely explains how 40 percent of all U.S. airlines’ flights, year-in/year-out fail to arrive on time, disrupting the travel of around 850,000 people a day, or about 310 million a year.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-16/malaysian-airlines-flight-370-complete-timeline-and-infographic"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:55:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
