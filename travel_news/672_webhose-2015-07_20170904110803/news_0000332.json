As the average fuel price of Singapore kerosene for the month of June in 2015 was US$74.63 per barrel, the benchmark fuel price used for calculation of the fuel surcharge level will be within the range of US$70.00 to US$74.99 per barrel (refer to table below).\nThe international cargo fuel surcharge will therefore be 52 yen per kg on long-haul international routes, 39 yen per kg on medium-haul international routes, and 28 yen on short-haul routes.\nSource:- Japan Airlines\nRelated Posts JAL Cargo Fuel Surcharge from the Month of September 2013 Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism approves Finnair’s inclusion in the joint business between Japan Airlines and British Airways Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building JAL Announces International Fare Fuel Surcharge for Tickets Issued between October and November 2013 JAL Group Announces Medium Term Management Plan Rolling Plan 2014", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:04:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
