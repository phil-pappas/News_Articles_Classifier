Sky News 03 Jul 2015 Business Lucinda Holdforth arrives at Supreme Court, where Qantas fought to suppress a book she planned to write. Picture: Britta Campion Source: News Corp Australia \nA TELL-ALL book about Qantas’s 2011 fleet grounding has been permanently shelved after the airline and the book’s author reached an out-of-court settlement. \nLucinda Holdforth, the former speechwriter to Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, was taken to court by Qantas after threatening to publish a manuscript detailing the inside story of the controversial grounding. \nThe book was titled Fighting Words and drew on Ms Holdforth’s experiences. \nHowever, the manuscript has a permanent injunction on it after the two parties announced to the Supreme Court in Sydney that they had reached a confidential settlement.

Picture: Britta Campion Source: News Corp Australia \nA statement from Qantas said the injunction was due to the “commercial in confidence nature of the content”. \n“Both parties consider the matter closed,” the statement said. \nMs Holdforth still worked for Qantas when the matter went to court in June but has since resigned from the company. \nThe settlement came after mediation urged by Supreme Court judge Patricia Bergin at the initial hearing. \nIt is understood 30 pages of the manuscript that do not feature Qantas are not covered by the injunction but it is not known what Ms Holdforth will do with that text. \nQantas took Ms Holdforth to court to stop the publication of Fighting Words, saying she had sought to exploit “confidential internal information that she was privy to”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T15:37:24.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
