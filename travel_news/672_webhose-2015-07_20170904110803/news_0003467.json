That's what this young elephant went through when it decided to chase after a lion. \nThe thing about lions is that they most often belong to a pride - so if you pick a fight with one, you pick a fight with its friends. \nA video uploaded to YouTube by GS Features shows a young elephant who did just that - and ending up fleeing from the hungry pride. \nThe footage was filmed in the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia. \nAt 0:14, the video shows the beginning of the altercation, as the elephant confidently chases a lion. \nHowever the elephant runs into other lions and the tables turn. \nThe lions then begin chasing the elephant while attempting to take it down. \nThe elephant disappears with the lions hot on its heels, but luckily, according to GS Features, it manages to escape with only a few scratches. \nWatch the video below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T09:46:18.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
