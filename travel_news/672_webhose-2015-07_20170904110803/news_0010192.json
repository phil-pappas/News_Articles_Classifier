It has not been seen on television, including on the beleaguered Al Jazeera America channel.\nDebuting on the weekend set aside for celebrating the birth of the U.S., the video is entitled \"Americans Show Why USA is the #1 Country in the World.\" It begins with a man who explains that most people probably know that Americans lead the world in Olympic medals won, Nobel laureates and billionaires.\nThen it goes on to list other benchmarks, including the large number of people imprisoned and the amount of guns owned. The U.S. also has a leading percentage of obese people, one man said.\n\"A third of us can't even see our own toes,\" he said.\nA man holding red, white and blue balloons claims that Americans make 89 percent of the world's pornography. \"That makes porn as American as church on Sunday,\" the man said.\nAt its end, a man in a stars-and-stripes hat said that \"if anybody ever tells you that American is not that great, just say, 'God bless the country with the most deaths by lawnmowers.'\" A guitar plays \"America the Beautiful\" in the background.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:30:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
