With Cuba and the United States recently returning to the negotiation table to restore diplomatic ties, the timeliness of the biology trip allowed the students to soak in more than just scientific research, but also the culture and history that comes along with world travel. VVC biology professor Dr. Hinrich Kaiser said that although this trip he led was biology-focused, he wanted to make it a “much broader experience.” This rare opportunity for community college students to travel abroad and conduct fieldwork led the group of nine students and Kaiser to Costa Rica, Cuba, and Panama for three weeks of research-intensive tours and explorations. “Every day we’d go on a hike, go into the jungle, and find things,” student Kimberly Antekeier said. “Cesar had an eye for everything,” she said of their tour guide in Costa Rica, who is now studying some of the unidentified specimen that the team found in order to find if any are new species. Kaiser, who came to VVC in 2002 from the university level, has taken students on 10 trips to East Timor, but this year’s trip was the first of its kind, focusing more on documentation than collecting specimens. “We did a photo safari rather than collecting specimen,” Kaiser said. “We write preliminaries from our observations.” One observation they made on the trip Kaiser says is “certainly publishable,” which was a cannibal frog they witnessed eat a smaller frog of its kind. The lessons on the trip weren't all fieldwork lessons, however. “They also learned what a country is like that doesn’t have what we have,” Kaiser said. “Cuba is still the way Eastern Europe used to be, while our students are used to having everything. It’s a bit of a shock.” Antekeier said nearly everyone they came across in Cuba was ecstatic to meet Americans, but that their economy is so poor, they’d never be able to afford visiting America. “It was so interesting to see how another part of the world lives,” Antekeier said. “Cuba is so isolated.” The students were also able to visit many significant sites on their trip, including a biodiversity museum, the Panama Canal, and the Playa Giron on the Bay of Pigs, where they took a photo with the U.S. and Cuban flags to celebrate the rapprochement between the countries, which they sent attached with a letter to both President Barack Obama and President Fidel Castro. Since winning a $5,000 grant from the VVC Foundation a couple weeks ago, Kaiser’s plans for the next trip are already underway. “Next year is the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor,” Kaiser said. “We’d travel to the southern pacific islands and end the trip in Hiroshima, creating a trip in which science is bookended by the history of America and Japan in the second world war.” Kaiser believes Costa Rica was a great place for the students to see the diversity of Central America both biologically and culturally. “I think that it will hopefully get students to always be open-minded and to get a natural aspect of politics,” Kaiser said. “What I’m trying to produce, since we’re at a community college, where there are people of all different backgrounds, is not only biologists, but responsible citizens.” Charity Lindsey may be contacted at clindsey@vvdailypress.com or 760-951-6231.
