Tickets are available for purchase through all LAN and TAM sales channels. \nTherefore, as of November 4, LAN will operate seven weekly flights from the Santiago International Airport, via São Paulo, to the Milan-Malpensa Airport. \nThe route operated between São Paulo and Milan is currently being operated using Airbus A330s. Beginning in November, the route will be operated by LAN using Boeing 787 airliners. Benefits of using the Boeing 787 family includes less fuel consumption as compared to similar aircraft, and reducing environmental impact and CO2 emission by 20%. \n“This new flight will allow us to connect Santiago and Milan, via São Paulo, using our new Boeing 787s, which offers 13% more seats and an improved executive class, with cutting-edge in-flight entertainment, thereby allowing us to connect more people between South America and Europe. With this we reinforce our commitment to improving travel experience, reducing the environmental impact of our operations and serving as a bridge between South America and the rest of the world,\" said Roberto Alvo, CEO of International Business and Alliances at LATAM Airlines Group. \nThe executive also touched on the renovation of the new terminal 3 at the Guarulhos Airport, mentioning its “first-class infrastructure, allowing for shorter connection times in flights via São Paulo and providing passengers with an improved travel experience.” \nLATAM Airlines Group's presence in Europe \nLATAM Airlines Group currently operates five routes between South America and Europe: Madrid, Milan, London, Paris, Frankfurt and as of October 1 of this year will begin operations to Barcelona, from São Paulo. Furthermore, LAN will add three additional structural services between Santiago and Madrid as of September 2015 and TAM will strengthen its operations between São Paulo and Madrid during this year’s high season, from June 25 to September 30. \nAdditionally, LAN and TAM passengers have the unique opportunity of traveling to Europe using the “Multidestination” option, which allows them to reach the continent via one city and return from a different city for a very similar price to what they would pay for a round trip to a single city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:03:51.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
