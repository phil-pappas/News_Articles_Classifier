(Andrew Burton / Reuters/REUTERS) By Paul Farhi July 14 at 6:00 AM Follow @farhip Is it news or is it advocacy? In the case of the Seventy Four , a new news site focused on education, the answer appears to be yes.\nThe site, co-founded and edited by former CNN and NBC anchor Campbell Brown, bills itself as “a non-profit, nonpartisan online newsroom aimed at driving a much-needed conversation about reforming America’s education system.” The name refers to the 74 million children in the U.S. under 18.\nBrown, who oversees the Seventy Four’s 14-person newsroom in New York, says the site will focus on K-12 education, federal education policy and the 2016 election. She promised that it will feature accountability and investigative reporting, particularly about how public-education funds are spent.\n“Obviously, we’re going to challenge the education status quo and education establishment,” she said in an interview, “but we’re also going to highlight what’s working. This is not going to be a one-size-fits-all site.”\nIt will, she insists, take a “non-partisan” approach to some of the many contentious issues roiling education, from teacher tenure to the expansion of charter schools to the use of taxpayer funds to support vouchers for private education.\nOf course, it depends on what your definition of “nonpartisan” is.\n[ From 2014: Campbell Brown goes after teacher tenure in transition from journalist to advocate ]\nThe Seventy Four’s first articles on Monday suggest it favors a reform agenda advocated primarily by business interests and conservative politicians and strongly opposed by public-school teachers and their unions.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@farhip", "https://www.the74million.org/"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T13:46:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
