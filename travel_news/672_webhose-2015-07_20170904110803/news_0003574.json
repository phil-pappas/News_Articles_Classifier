The centre will feature some of the world’s most iconic brands, including Armani, Calvin Klein, Coach, Cole Haan, Hugo Boss, Ports 1961, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, Polo Ralph Lauren and Tumi, with more great names to follow in the coming months – all offering savings of up to 70%, all year round. \nMcArthurGlen Designer Outlet Vancouver Airport is a joint venture between McArthurGlen,Europe’s leading owner, developer and manager of designer outlets, and Vancouver Airport Authority, a community-based, not-for-profit organization that operates Vancouver International Airport (YVR). Also featured at the designer outlet are some Vancouver favourites, including lifestyle concept store SL and Italian-style coffee house Caffè Artigiano, with local social food marketplace Hawker’s Market opening a pop-up initiative, Hawkers Mercado, over the summer months. The centre iseasily accessible via public transport, with Canada Line's Templeton Station located across the street. Shoppers travelling from downtown Vancouver will be at the centre in just over 20 minutes, while those coming from the airport will arrive in three minutes. Travel between the airport and Templeton Station is free. Rob Thurlow, General Manager of the McArthurGlen Designer Outlet, says: “The opening of our new centre marks a great day for Richmond and for the Lower Mainland. Not only are we opening a new and exciting fashion destination, offering some of the best-loved names in fashion, we are also initially creating 600 new jobs at the centre, with further jobs created indirectly in the community, in particular in the tourism sector.” Joan Jove, McArthurGlen’s Development Director for Canada, says: “As Europe’s leader in designer outlet retailing, McArthurGlen aims to create the finest designer outlet experience – a place where shoppers can find the best-loved names in fashion, as well as an exciting destination to spend time with friends and family.” “We have worked hard, together with our partner Vancouver Airport Authority, and with our local communities and brand partners, to create a unique shopping experience for Greater Vancouver.” The centre’s location adjoining the airport makes it an ideal shopping venue for the millions of tourists who visit the city each year. A growing hub and gateway connecting Asia to the Americas, YVR is the second busiest airport in Canada, serving more than 19 million passengers in 2014. Voted Best Airport in North America by Skytrax for six consecutive years, YVR takes an innovative approach to sustainable airport growth. “After years of planning and construction, it’s very exciting to welcome the community to McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Vancouver Airport. Not only will the centre become a key tourism destination in our region, it’s also important to YVR’s role as a key economic driver,” says Craig Richmond, President & CEO, Vancouver Airport Authority. “Through the designer outlet, we are creating jobs and a valuable source of non-aeronautical revenue that helps YVR, a not-for-profit organization, keep its airline costs low while delivering an exceptional airport experience.” McArthurGlen Designer Outlet Vancouver Airport opens today with an initial 240,000 sq ft (22,500m²) of retail and dining space, with 2,000 car parking spaces. A second phase of 135,000 sq ft (12,500m²) is set to open in 2017. The design reflects a blend of European heritage and traditional Vancouver architectural style, in particular the distinctive brick facades of the city's historic and vibrant Gastown district. Integral to all YVR projects and McArthurGlen centres is a striking, accessible art feature that provides a gathering place and a moment of calm for customers. The centre is home to the latest work by acclaimed local contemporary visual artist Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas. SEI is a powerful, 40-foot (12-metre) long sculpture of a whale breaching out of the water and provides a visually stunning focal point for the centre.
