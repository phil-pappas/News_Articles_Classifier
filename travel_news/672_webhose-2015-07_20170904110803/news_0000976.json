But his words “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth” could be a maxim for companies KO’d by disruption. If, like Tyson, they don’t roll with the punches and hit back, then they could face knockout. The best recent example of disruption – that is, when something enters the market which is better and cheaper than the existing products and services – is Uber, the San Francisco-based car-hailing service, which is expected to generate $10bn in revenue before the year is out. Founded in March 2009 by chief executive Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, the company lets people with smartphones order a driver quickly. Having harnessed nascent technology, Uber is now available in 58 countries and 311 cities worldwide, and has proven so successful that numerous others have attempted to ape its business model – a trend that is known as “Uberification”. Jack Hidary, a New York-based technology and financial entrepreneur, applauds Uber’s boldness. Speaking at Tata Communications’ third annual Networked Enterprise Institute (NEI) summit, held in June at Coworth Park in Ascot, he said: “That’s the kind of brazenness sometimes it takes. Uber realised that it makes sense to have a unified interface across the whole globe... They went like a bull in a china shop to go and do that.” While disruption transforms business models, it always leads to massive waves of growth With technology racing ahead at a frightening speed, it is imperative that companies are agile enough to be able to adapt their business plans. For instance, Google has developed driverless cars. So how long will it take for Uber’s drivers to be disrupted? Tech trends are evolving so rapidly. Mr Hidary pointed out that Amazon’s Kindle reader sales were down 69pc in 2014 when compared with the year before – however Amazon had already anticipated this and developed a smartphone app, allowing e-books to be read that way. “And it won’t be long before wearables – which have only really just come into the market – will be disrupted by ‘implantables’,” he added. Similarly, and largely thanks to the rise of smartphones, banks are under pressure to evolve, with customers demanding to access their account details in real time on their various devices and channels. European banks are also exploring new opportunities in the fast-growing markets of Asia. Sumeet Walia, head of global enterprise business at Tata Communications, said: “Many of these banks are looking at emerging markets and we are becoming the vehicle to take them there, because we know them very well.” Similarly, Airbnb is another San Francisco-based start-up that has used technology to overturn a business, this time in the hotel industry. Today it is valued at $25.5bn, almost $5bn more than giants Marriott – not bad, considering it doesn’t actually own any accommodation property. Change is not necessarily a bad thing – certainly not for the wider community. But chief executives and business leaders need to embrace such technology, says Scott D Anthony, managing partner of Innosight and an expert in disruptive innovation. “The disruption that chief executives face today in fact provides the greatest growth opportunities they will ever see,” he told delegates at Tata Communications’ NEI. “While disruption transforms business models, it always leads to massive waves of growth. The fundamental challenge a leader faces is their organisation is built and optimised to execute yesterday’s business model, not to invent tomorrow’s.” Iron Mike’s words should resonate with tech businesses. Have a plan for after you have been punched in the mouth, or disrupted, and have the agility to fight back or be flattened. Disruption - the expert view Simon Davies, vice president enterprise business unit, Salesforce “Organisations are seeing how they can take advantage of new markets created by smartphone technology, which offers new ways of connecting to the customer as an individual. To disrupt you have to listen to what organisations and customers want to see in their markets; help them understand the trends that are taking place in other industries.” Scott D Anthony, managing partner, Innosight “How do companies make sure they continue to operate with excellence while also inventing, twisting and turning in the directions required for long-term success? A systematic problem requires a system-level solution: cohesive interventions to build innovation deeply within the culture of your organisation.” Julie Woods-Moss, chief executive of Tata Communications’ NextGen business “Start-ups are so exciting because they place you right at the heart of what is cutting edge. They are on the cusp of how to create value from technology. The difference between success and failure is timing. What people expect from technology is also in constant flux, with high demand currently for innovations that bring a Facebook-like retail experience to shoppers.” See how you can connect your business at tatacommunications.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:05:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
