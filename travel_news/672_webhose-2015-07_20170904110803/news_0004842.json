We believe once they have experienced our resort and the fantastic guest privileges they receive with their stay, guests will want to come back again and again, and tell their family and friends about it, too,” said Kevin Osborn, General Manager of Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort. \nMembership sales for Founders Club Premier begin later this month and may be purchased by calling 1-800-DOLLYWOOD or by visiting premier.dollywoodsdreammore.com.

Additionally, the first 1,000 members of the Founders Club Premier program receive a copy of Dolly Parton’s book, Dream More : Celebrate the Dreamer in You . \nDollywood’s DreamMore Resort is the first resort created by Dollywood and Dolly Parton. The destination features 300 guest rooms and suites designed with family travelers in mind. Located adjacent to the Dollywood Theme Park and Dollywood’s Splash Country Water Park, the resort is inspired by Dolly Parton’s warm childhood memories of growing up on her family’s front porch in the Smoky Mountains. \n“My new resort is a dream 30 years in the making,” explained resort founder and visionary Dolly Parton. “My dream is that families who stay with us will be reminded that encouraging and loving each other is a powerful way to connect with one another.” \n“Our goal is to bring visitors to the beautiful Smokies and have Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort guests experience our special privileges which aren’t available anywhere else,” added Osborn. “With rooms starting at $179, these benefits give families more of what they want in a Dollywood vacation – more play, more time and more value.” \nGuest privileges at Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort include front-of-the-line access at Dollywood with a Time Saver Pass; early Saturday entry to Dollywood; door-to-door transportation from the resort to both Dollywood parks; a special resort entrance to the parks; complimentary delivery of park purchases to resort guest rooms; complimentary Wi-Fi access in the resort; and complimentary resort parking. \nIn addition to the guest privileges, amenities at the property include indoor and outdoor pools, a full-service restaurant, spa and salon, fitness center, conference center, and family activities center, all of which are enhanced by spectacular mountain views. \nFor more information about Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort or to book a reservation, guests should visit DollywoodsDreamMore.com or call 1-800-DOLLYWOOD. \nAbout The Dollywood Company: A highly awarded and widely recognized leader in the amusement industry, The Dollywood Company consists of the 150-acre Dollywood theme park; the 35-acre Dollywood’s Splash Country; Dollywood Cabins; and Dollywood’s DreamMore Resort, scheduled to open in 2015.
