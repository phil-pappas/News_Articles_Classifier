If your family is far from those seen grinning in glossy travel brochures and more akin to gracing the cover of \"Dysfunctional Weekly\" then a family vacation can add yet another layer of crazy to the normal daily drama. Here are a list of the 10 most common family vacation problems along with solutions to help save your sanity... \n1. Reality Check - We're all fighting all of the time. Everyone is stressed out. We all need vacation so we can get away and reconnect. Solution - Chances are a family therapist might do you more good than a vacation. Traveling can challenge everyone's patience, tempers and comfort zones. This can lead to even more stress and anxiety. Everyone needs to be in the right frame of mind and willing to play fair in order for a family vacation to fun, successful, memorable and enjoyable for all. \n2. Money, Money Money - You probably scrimped, saved and slaved all year for that week or two of vacation nirvana. Vacation is a time to splurge, indulge and party like it's 1999! Of course every attraction and theme park is designed to dump the kids right into the middle of the gift shop! Solution - Frank budget discussions need to happen very early in the vacation planning process. Set a budget for your itinerary (transportation, lodging, food, and entertainment) as well as spending and a few splurges along the way. A vacation allowance is a great opportunity to teach kids good spending habits and budgeting. If you're traveling as part of a larger group or with extended family members, it's best to spell out everyone's financial responsibilities and obligations in writing, far in advance to protect against misunderstandings that can lead to arguments and resentments. \n3. Problems Getting Along- Not a day goes by without a fight or argument in our house! It's impossible for everyone to just get along! Solution - Pitching an umbrella in Paradise or visiting the \"Happiest Place On Earth\" doesn't mean your family will \"magically\" get along. Forget perfection, pick your battles and make sure everyone can agree to disagree respectfully. \n4. Lack of Space - My kids can't be in the same room with one another for five minutes without me having to step in and referee. Solution - So...what do you think is going to happen if your entire family is sharing one hotel room with one bathroom for an entire week? If you're kids need neutral corners to keep the sparks from flying then upgrade your living quarters if the budget will allow. Plan an itinerary that includes activities where each child can enjoy separate age appropriate activities like those offer in resort and cruise ship kids clubs. OR Consider taking the kids on separate vacations. There is no rule carved in stone high atop a mountain that says families MUST all vacation together at the precise same time. Often giving each child the opportunity to be the center of attention and have one one one time with parents or grandparents can actually bring siblings together. ( counter intuitive, I know but true ). \n5. Nobody Can Make a Decision - Everyone in our family has such different opinions. Everyone had their own unique agenda. Something as simple as where to go to eat dinner turns into an hour long loop of \"I dunno what do you want to do\". I don't want us spending our time fighting on family vacation. Solution - Have a plan for success. Get older children involved in planning out your itinerary in advance and then stick to that plan. This may require choices, compromises and even picking options out of a hat. \n6. Partying Policies - Just because my kid is on vacation doesn't mean they can____", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:04:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
