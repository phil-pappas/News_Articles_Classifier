The claims were \"very concerning,\" Manby said.\n\"These allegations, if true, are not consistent with the values of the SeaWorld organization and will not be tolerated,\" he said.\nPETA said its own investigation revealed a human-resources worker at SeaWorld San Diego named Paul McComb incited protesters and posted incendiary comments on social media while masquerading as an animal-rights activist since 2012.\nMcComb, who allegedly used the alias Thomas Jones, was arrested along with other animal rights activists during a 2014 protest at the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California, PETA said.\nEfforts to find a phone listing for McComb weren't successful Thursday.\nSeaWorld did not name McComb but said the employee in question was placed on paid administrative leave pending findings of the investigation.\nThe investigator, Ron Olson of the firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, will be given \"full access to our organization and people,\" Manby said.\nSeaWorld has been under fire since the 2013 documentary film \"Blackfish\" suggested the treatment of captive orcas provokes violent behaviour.
