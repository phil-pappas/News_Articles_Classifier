Adapted from Tim Horton/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 \nThe official name is the William Randolph Hearst Greek Theatre, but it's known locally as simply the Greek Theatre. It's an 8,500-seat amphitheater owned and operated by the University of California, Berkeley, and a fine place to enjoy a summer concert. The Berkeley Greek Theatre Concert Event \nSome concerts are offered through Cal Performances , but others are organized by promoter Another Planet Entertainment . The mix of performers is eclectic. During the 2013 season, artists included Yo-Yo Ma, Placido Domingo, John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival, rock band Furthur (founded by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Phil Lesh) and rock, world, and reggae band Rebelution. \nAt the classical performances, Berkeley audiences are among the best to be in of any California venue we've been in. They're quiet and attentive and nice to each other - but far too many arrive late, which can delay the start of the performance. The Berkeley Greek Theatre Venue \nThe structure has been around for more than 100 years, constructed in a classic Greek style. The hillside location has great views of the San Francisco Bay and parts of the university campus (but only from the very top of the property). \nThe Greek Theatre is wheelchair accessible. The wheelchair ramp is in front of the Ticket Office and there's a drop off point at the North gate. Reviews, Likes and Dislikes \nEveryone agrees that the reviews from the Greek Theatre are spectacular, with views of the university campus, Golden Gate and Bay Bridges, San Francisco and - on a clear enough day - Mount Tamalpais in Marin County. \nI like the Greek for its size and the wide range of performers they attract. Parking can be a nuisance, but the tips below may help minimize that. \nRead their reviews on Yelp and Tripadvisor . Tips for Enjoying Concerts at the Berkeley Greek Theatre Seats in the numbered sections are on simple concrete steps with no backs or cushions. No matter what kind of cushion Mother Nature may have provided you, something soft to sit on is a must. Cushions are available for rent, but for a steep price - or bring your own. If you're sitting in the concrete step section, it's best not to arrive too early - it just extends the amount of time you have to sit. Food is available for sale, but you can also bring your own as long as you carry in an allowed container. Large backpacks, ice chests and picnic baskets aren't allowed inside and you can't bring in any alcoholic beverages - or cans and bottles no matter what they contain These items are not allowed: strollers, large blankets, structured stadiums chairs, lawn furniture, weapons of any kind, umbrellas. Pets are not allowed, but you can bring your service animal. Doors open for most shows open 1.5 hours before show time The upper sections have lots of shallow steps and no handrails. If your mobility is limited, it may be better to choose a seat in a lettered section. Tickets and Reservations for the Berkeley Greek Theatre \nBuy your tickets online through Ticketmaster (with their usual \"convenience\" fees). \nThe Box Office at the Greek Theatre is only open on the performance day - 1.5 hours before show time - for tickets sales and will call pickup. You also can buy tickets in advance at the Cal Performances Box Office at Zellerbach Hall on the university campus, with no fee. Layout of the Berkeley Greek Theatre \nThe theatre is laid out in a semicircle with these sections: A flat floor near the stage (The Pit) The lower tiered sections - A through F - have folding seats A row of concrete \"throne seats\" runs along the top of the first tier The upper tiered sections - 1 through 10 - are backless, concrete steps only. Seats in row 20 (the top row) have a wall behind them, but it's chillier up there because it's less sheltered - and if you're in the seats on the sides, outside noise can creep in from street below and even the railroad across town A grassy lawn area is behind and above all the seats. It has the best views of the surroundings and is closest to the bar and restrooms. Seating Options \nIf you read online reviews, especially if the reviewer has only attended one concert, it can be confusing. Some talk about the place being general admission only, while others talk about reserved seating. Both are true, depending on the specific concert you attend. The sections below explain how each one works. If you need more information, seating charts are at the APE website \nGeneral Admission Only Setup: For some shows, all seats are \"General Admission\" which allows flexibility to dance close to the stage or enjoy the show from further back. For those shows, it's first come, first served and Greek Theatre veterans recommend arriving early so you can be first in line. Using the gate up the hill next to Bowles Hall instead of the one near the box office, you can get inside faster. \nReserved Seating Setup : For some shows, only the seats near the stage are reserved and for others, the second tier is also reserved. The lawn area is always general admission. The Basics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:39:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
