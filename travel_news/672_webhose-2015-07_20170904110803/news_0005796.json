From 2016, high earners will find their annual tax-free allowance tapers away from £40,000 currently to £10,000 – a move that will more than fund changes to inheritance tax, Mr Osborne said. But having introduced radical reforms last year allowing people to cash in their annuities on retirement, the Chancellor declared today he wanted to help those “at the other end of the age scale”, who were starting out saving for their retirement. A consultation, open from now until September 30, will seek views on “an alternative system that is simple and transparent”, which would help young savers better understand the benefits and risks of pension plans. “The truth is Britain isn’t saving enough and that’s something we need to fix in our economy too,” said Mr Osborne. “I am open to further radical change.” George Osborne will consider radical changes to pension tax One option could be to tax pensions like ISAs, in which the initial contribution is from income that has already been taxed, but which would be exempt from further tax when the policy holder reaches retirement age. “You pay in from taxed income – and it is tax-free when you take it out,” Mr Osborne said. “And in-between it receives a top-up from the government. “If people are to take responsibility for their retirement, it is important that the support on offer from the Government is simple and transparent, and that complexity does not undermine the incentive for individuals to save,” Mr Osborne said. However, young savers would need some reassurance that their pension contributions would not become subject to tax at a later date, warned Mike Smedley, pensions partner at KPMG. “It’s a long time to trust the tax system to stay the same,” he said. “The industry reaction will be negative about treating pensions like Isas, because it begs the question, why have a pension market at all?” Mr Smedley said. “The industry has been calling for stability and certainty. In the short-term, the consultation is clearly adding to the uncertainty. “Today’s announcements don’t encourage anyone to save in pensions as it stands.” People needed to trust in a stable pensions system, agreed Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds. “Tinkering with the tax treatment of pensions from one Budget to the next does absolutely nothing to build confidence in them, and constant change may even discourage people from saving for retirement.” However, the move to publish a Green Paper calling for views rather than a declaration of intent was broadly welcomed by pensions experts. “It is good that the Government is consulting on all of this and not making the mistake they made with the pension freedoms [announced in 2014], which were brought in hastily and without full consideration of all the issues that could arise,” said Malcolm McLean, senior consultant at Barnett Waddingham. The Government also reaffirmed its desire to set up a secondary annuities market where pensioners can sell on their annuities; however, its launch has been put back until 2017 – a “sensible move”, Mr Smedley said, which recognises that the policy is “a bit more complicated than they thought”. The Government’s plans for the secondary annuities market will be published in the autumn. Pension savers would also find it easier to take advantage of the freedoms announced in 2014, with the Government saying it would look at options to make switching schemes easier, alongside a clampdown on excessive exit fees. The Telegraph has campaigned in recent months to ensure that people over 55 are able to claim the pension freedoms that are their due. “Overall this has been yet another eventful Budget from the Chancellor, albeit with major and radical decisions still to be taken over the coming year,” added Mr McLean. “It looks very much like pensions will continue to be big news over the next few years.” Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:01:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
