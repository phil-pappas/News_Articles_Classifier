In fact, until just a few months ago, Africa was a distant destination, a dream destination, for sure, but a place that existed for me largely in my mind. Africa had never been home, but my understanding of this continent changed dramatically this year with not just one but two very distinct \"pinch me\" experiences. The first involved summiting Africa's highest peak, a bucket list trip that altered me in ways I wasn't expecting. The second involved a different kind of peak -- a career highlight for sure -- and certainly solidified my feelings toward this once-faraway place. I first set foot on African soil just four months ago, when I traveled to Tanzania. I was 35 years old, had just moved to New York and decided it was time to stop talking about Africa and finally go. But I needed to go in a big way -- and to me, that meant attempting to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, all 19,345 feet of it. By the time I reached the summit, I was changed, physically and emotionally. From the moment I started back down the mountain, the little voice in my head wondered: When would I return to Africa? Little did I know that answer would be just four months later. Discovering Kenya 10 photos CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin recently visited a Maasai village in Kenya's Masai Mara. She was greeted with a traditional Maasai warrior song followed by a walk around the village to see the cattle and goats (the village's currency) and women's beadwork. She was sent off by the local kids. (They didn't speak English but knew exactly how to high five.) Hide Caption 1 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos Brooke landed an exclusive interview with President Obama's half-sister, Auma Obama, center. She was invited into the Obama homestead, where their step-grandmother \"Mama Sarah,\" right, told the story of when she first met Barack Obama in Kenya. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos On Brooke's last night at Sanctuary Olonana in the Masai Mara, she enjoyed a private dinner along the Mara River, where local Maasai men performed traditional songs/chants. The experience ranks as one of the most special nights of her life, she says.

Hide Caption 4 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos Brooke and Lindsay were sad to leave the Masai Mara. On their last day, they bid Joseph \"Ashe,\" which means \"thank you\" in Maa, the Maasai language. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos The giraffe was Brooke's favorite animal spotted on safari. Trivia: A group of giraffes is called a \"tower.\" Hide Caption 6 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos Masai Mara means \"the land of the spotted trees\" because many years ago, elephants had eaten so many of the trees. During this trip, Brooke watched the beginning of the \"Great Migration,\" when hundreds of thousands of animals cross over into Kenya from Tanzania's Serengeti. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos Before Brooke left Africa, she took a trip to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, where baby orphaned elephants are nursed back to health. Brooke and producer Lindsay \"adopted\" two of them; she couldn't help the fist bump.

Hide Caption 9 of 10 Discovering Kenya 10 photos At one point on safari, Brooke's Land Cruiser was surrounded by elephants. (More trivia: A group of elephants is called a \"memory.\" Elephants are emotional animals and, as Joseph explained, are capable of experiencing joy, sadness and mourning.) Hide Caption 10 of 10 In late spring, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would be traveling to Kenya in July for his Entrepreneurship Summit. Last summer, he invited all the African leaders to Washington, and he has created a number of U.S.-based African initiatives. But this trip would be special, because it would be the first time as sitting president that Obama would return to Kenya and revisit his roots. It was a story I wanted to tell. With hard work and some good help, I eventually landed an exclusive interview with Auma Obama , President Obama's half-sister. My producer and I would travel to the Obama family's ancestral village in western Kenya, visit Sauti Kuu (Swahili for \"powerful voices\"), Auma's foundation empowering children and families in that community, and see how these Kenyans -- half a world away -- feel about Obama's return \"home.\" Through our days on the ground, I discovered that our opportunity with Auma would also provide a rare window into the Obama family. She is easily the closest sibling to the President (and as a result, she is fiercely private and protective of her family). She shared stories with me about what it feels like when she returns to her ancestral home of Nyang'oma Kogelo, where, seven years after her brother arrived in the White House, many little boys are now named \"Barack Obama.\" Obama: 'I'm the first Kenyan-American to be president' Auma took us to her family homestead and introduced me to \"Mama Sarah,\" the 93-year-old grandmother to Auma and Barack. Auma even walked me to her father's grave, where she shared with me in almost a whisper what she believes her father -- if he were still alive -- would say to his son, the President of the United States.
