Filming first began on August 18, after dozens of workers prepared the site just days before their arrival.\nIn fact, the studio even paid the owners of a local restaurant to close for three months, meaning that the crew would have unrestricted access to the area's pebble beach.\nFilming began last August, just days after dozens of workers prepped the site and closed the local restaurant to offer privacy\nThe rocky island, off the Maltese coast, was thrilled to welcome the A-listers to their tiny paradise.\nWith a population of just 31,000, local authorities are hopeful that the film will boost tourism in the area once it's released - in the same way that Game of Thrones has brought notoriety to the country.\nAnd in case you needed another reason to visit the fjord-like inlet, it's also the perfect place to take in gorgeous crystal blue sea views, sunbathe and snorkel.\nĠgantija Temples\nNo visit to Gozo is complete without a trip to one of the most important archaeological sites in the Maltese Islands: the Ġgantija Temples\nOne of the most important archaeological sites in the Maltese Islands, Gozo's Ġgantija Temples date back to between 3,600 and 3,200 BC - making them older than the Egyptian Pyramids.\nThe Neolithic temple complex is comprised of two structures, which were built side by side and are enclosed within a boundary wall, and may have served as the site of a fertility cult.\nAnd for travellers as worldly as Angelina and Brad, it wouldn't be surprising to hear that the globe-trotting couple stopped off to take in the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nCitadel Cinema\nFor those travelling with a large family, it's always good to plan for a rainy day.
