Source: Supplied \nYOU would be mad too if you were served this. \nA man has shamed an airport after he forked out his hard-earned dough for a hearty breakfast, only to end up gobsmacked. \nHe shared the photo of the stingy “bacon and egg roll” on Reddit , which contained what could be the world’s smallest portions inside a seemingly unbuttered lump of bread. \nThe Reddit user — who goes by the handle “Spambox”— claims to have paid £3.20 ($6.50), for the sad-looking meal at the popular cafe brand EAT at Edinburgh Airport in Scotland. \n“I never asked for a refund as I figured it must be overpriced s*** cause it’s an airport,” he wrote. \n“The part that made it worse was that they told me to take a seat and they’d bring it over. The only empty table was clearly empty because it hadn’t been cleaned for what appeared to be weeks and then after 15 minutes I had to go back and ask where my roll was which they had totally forgot about.” \nCommenters quickly pointed out the funny side of his misfortune, with one saying: “What are they using, hummingbird eggs?” \nAn airport spokesperson has since issued an apology, telling The Scotsman: “We work closely with all of our food and beverage providers to ensure we offer customers the best choice of refreshments and service. \n“Sadly on this occasion we fell below the mark and offer our apologies to this customer. Clearly this is not the service we should be providing and we will be addressing this complaint with EAT.” \nnews.com.au has contacted EAT for comment.
