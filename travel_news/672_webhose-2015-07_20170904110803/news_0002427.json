At the center of the action is the new St. Regis Istanbul ( stregis.com ), a contemporary haven that opened in April near Maçka Democracy Park. The hotel’s 136 guest rooms and suites—which include a two-bedroom Presidential Suite and the sleek Bentley Suite—feature a bold blend of bronze, marble, leather, and wood. Many rooms afford views of the park and of the Bosphorus Strait in the distance, vistas that can also be enjoyed from the first international outpost of Wolfgang Puck’s acclaimed Spago restaurant, set on the hotel’s rooftop. Following a day of shopping in Nişantaşı (commonly known as the Fifth Avenue of Istanbul), guests can unwind in the Iridium Spa’s traditional hammam or with a glass of rakı at the Petit “O” Bar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T17:51:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
