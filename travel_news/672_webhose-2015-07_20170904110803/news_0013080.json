The airlines are showing record passenger loads, so it’s more likely than not that your next flight will be completely full. So here are some ways you can prepare to make your next trip a success.\nArlene Fleming 1. Choose Seats As Soon As You Book Your Ticket When you book online and you’re given the option to choose your seats, take it. One, it makes you less likely to be involuntarily bumped from a flight. Two, you can avoid sitting in the dreaded middle seat or that horrible seat next to the lavatory.\nAirplane Image courtesy of Stock.xchng. Airplane Image courtesy of Stock.xchng 2. Book Early Morning Flights I make it a point to book the first flight in the morning. One, you can pretty much guarantee your plane will already be sitting at the gate, which means no delays. Two, people do tend to oversleep, so that crack-of-dawn flight may be a bit less crowded. Three, depending on the length of the flight, you can get in a good nap and be rested and ready to go when you reach your final destination.\nTraveler at a Global Entry kiosk.

Buy a Global Entry Card If you travel internationally even once, this $100 card -- which covers five years -- will pay for itself after one trip after you avoid long U.S. Customs and Border Protection lines. And the bonus? You’re automatically enrolled in the domestic PreCheck program run by the Transportation Security Administration. The PreCheck line lets users keep on their shoes and jackets, allows laptop computers to stay in their bags and tends to have much shorter wait times.\nEconomy Plus seating on United Airlines. Photo courtesy of United Airlines 4. Pay Extra for More Room Seats Let’s face it -- airline fees are here to stay. There are some that are more tolerable than others. One of those is having a bit more room on a packed flight. Most airlines will allow you to pay extra for seats in economy class -- and even first/business class -- that gives you more leg room. On Southwest Airlines , pay extra for Early Bird check-in , which will make it more likely you’ll get the seat you want. Click here for my post on how to find the best seats on all the major airlines. And a bonus -- those who buy more room also get early access onto the plane, making it more likely to get that valuable overhead bin space.\nThe entryway to the DFW Airport Centurion Lounge. Photo courtesy of American Express 5. Spring for Airline or Airport Lounge Access If the airplanes are packed, you can be assured that the airports will be packed as well. Do you really want to be jammed into a gate area or crowded restaurants as you wait for your flight? No. So spend up to $50 to get into airline or airport premium lounges. They offer a welcome respite from the masses, and in case something goes wrong, there are folks there who can help. See my list of U.S. airline lounges here . And if you have an American Express card, I highly recommend a visit to one of their six Centurion Lounges at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, Miami International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Entrance is free for Platinum and above members and $50 for all other cardholders.\nPublic Domain - Nasa.gov 6. Pack Your Own Snacks We all know that on most flights, free food has gone the way of the dinosaurs. And the food that is offered can sometimes be overpriced and not that tasty. So do what I do and carry a food bag with a mix of good eats. My food of choice includes nuts, granola, boiled eggs, cheese crackers, popcorn, some candy and smoked salmon. See how I used Pinterest to hack for travel snacks here .\n ", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/M/H/American-Express-DFW-Entry.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/0/-/9/sept1808.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/0/H/5/seats.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/A/G/Global-Entry-kiosk.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/z/4/plane.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/H/5/seats.jpg", "https://www.southwest.com/flight/early-bird-retrieve-reservation.html", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/0/z/4/plane.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/A/G/Global-Entry-kiosk.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/M/H/American-Express-DFW-Entry.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/4/O/econ-plus-jpg.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/-/9/sept1808.jpg", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/4/O/econ-plus-jpg.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:48:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
