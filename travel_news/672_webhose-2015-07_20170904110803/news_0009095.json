Bali, of course. \nAnd whether you seek dancing or romancing, retail or culture, surfing or hilltop meditation, are going solo or have tots in tow, the Indonesian Island of the Gods fits all comers. \nBukit Peninsula offers big-name resorts, spirituality abounds in Ubud in the mountains and the less-developed regions in the north but it's Seminyak and environs on the southwest coast that are the most happening for food, retail and fun. \nTourists play with the dogs on Seminyak Beach.

An Australian gourmet influence combined with an influx of international chefs has helped create a culinary scene where creative flair wins out. \nSample it yourself at Sarong in Seminyak, showcasing Will Meyrick's tantalising take on southeast Asian food; savor flip-fresh fish amid lush rice paddy surrounds at Sardine and taste Euro-Asian plates at LA-style glass bunker Kilo. \nBali's bars meanwhile are throbbing with Latam beats at hip hang outs such as La Favela and Motel Mexicola. Not to be missed are the island's day-to-night beach clubs, catering for families through to party animals. \nKu de ta and Potato Head Beach Club live up to their reputations, the former frequented by a Euro-glam crowd, the latter relaxed and retro-vibed. \nA tourist holds her dog while walking on Seminyak beach, near Kuta.

Have a rummage at the flea market then saunter along Jalan Laksmana toward The Legian hotel taking in art galleries, interior decor, antiques, fauxtiques and fashion along the way. \nStand-out boutiques include Natalie Dissel for jewels made with rare stones, horn, leather and precious metals; frocks and accessories by Gail Elliot; bright beachware by Kirsten Sikiotis at Maidenlove and not forgetting the beatnik mash-up of gallery, shop, café, motorbikes and surf boards at Deus ex Machina. \nBali, it's all about the relaxation.
