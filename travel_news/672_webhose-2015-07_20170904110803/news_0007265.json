Old scandals disappear and are replaced with new ones along, with new governments that come to power with the promise of change. \nFor instance, if scams during the erstwhile Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government originated out of irregularities in railways and allocation of telecom spectrum licences, then new ones have emerged over nepotism in recruitment of teachers and other professionals in government services in a state — something that has come to haunt the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party dispensation at the Centre, after it had stormed to power riding high on the promise of transparency and honesty. \nBefore the 2014 general elections, several polls found that corruption was the second biggest issue after inflation that determined the way people voted. So has the will of the people again been subverted at the behest of the few who seem to reap benefits from their proximity to high offices? Irrespective of who is in power, corruption in India is like the weather that people keep talking about — without being able to do anything about it! \nStrangely, elections that were supposed to cleanse the system have become the biggest reason behind corruption in India. Ill-gotten gains crawl their way into funding lavish election campaigns. So much so, that the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, 2001, observed that “electoral compulsions for funds become the foundation of the whole superstructure of corruption”. \nEnumerating graft in India can be an exasperating task and with hundreds of contradicting conspiracy theories and insinuations, the truth always gets undermined due to the lack of any real investigation. Every Indian businessman pays speed money to earn the blessings of those in power and firms known for their smart handling of the “system” even earn the confidence of investors at the bourses. \nIndia many say is an oligarchy where too many people have got too rich based on their proximity to the government. In the pre-liberalisation era, graft was a quaint affair where businessmen greased few hands to earn small favours. But post 1991, as the economy grew along with the quantum of greed, the numbers became staggering. In the late 1980s, allegations that a $50 million (Dh183.9 million) kickback had been paid on an Indian arms deal with Swedish firm Bofors engulfed the then government of Rajiv Gandhi. Comparing it with the present charges of money changing hands, the quantum of kickbacks involved in the Bofors deal appears like peanuts. \nPopular understanding about the permanence of corruption is partly explained by the sense of facileness that Indians have developed over charges of corruption. Corruption has almost become an idea, a term whereby an average Indian voter believes that people in power, if not corrupt, are incapable of holding on to public offices. It is considered as a natural extension of the effort that the Indian politicians put in to be in power. Everyone agrees that none could be really behind bars, but everyone expects the next government to be less corrupt. \nThe problem of corruption in India seems to correspond to the different phases of rapid political transformation since pre-independence. The first, officially coordinated ‘anti-corruption’ drive took place under the provincial Congress party governments in the late 1930s, while the British still ruled India. The Congress party then rallied its democratic principles against ‘corrupt’ systems of colonial authoritarianism. \nEvery case of corruption starts with the same cacophony that initially is considered as an excess on the part of those in power. It engulfs prime-time news television and then eventually precipitates as the news cycle changes. Political parties have mastered the trick to circumvent the initial exhilaration of the raucous Indian media. As the scam breaks, they have trained their spokespersons to repeat the tirade of statements and lie low waiting for the seasonal storm to blow away. They for long have stopped arguing about corruption as the new debates circle around the volume of financial dealings. India politicians for long have described corruption as a necessary evil. \nNepotism permeates Indian social life and had led to the development of the rigorous caste system in India for long. Indians for long have been the flag-bearers of family traditions rather than individuals who strive to attend supremacy in their chosen field of work. Politics, business, mainstream cinema and other occupations where talent is subservient to lineage are dominated by family cartels, where surnames surmount serviceability. Family connections invariably led to unhindered access to the offices of power, which is often used to create a sense of belonging to high places, creating a favourable argument to counter the age-old practice of nepotism. So when India’s Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj or Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje were accused of helping former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi, they claimed to be standing by an old family friend. \nSo will certain people in India eternally remain corrupt? The scourge is so ingrained that it is difficult to find any solution either in terms of reckoning or righteousness. A democratic India was expected to be less corrupt as the vibrant media was expected to expose the wrong-doers; a boisterous opposition was expected to force the government to bring in laws to curb the danger and an independent judiciary was expected to book the culprits and deliver justice while voters were expected to boot out the corrupt. \nAll of these have happened — but only to a certain degree. It is certainly not sufficient to stem the rot. In India, elimination of corruption needs an urgent societal change, where the deserving will be rewarded and family connections or positions will not necessarily guarantee success and status in public life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:53:10.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
