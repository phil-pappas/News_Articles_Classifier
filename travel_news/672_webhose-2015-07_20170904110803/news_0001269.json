Our panel is prepared to answer questions,\" presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said over the state-run radio station dzRB.\n\"According to our international law expert “ law of the sea expert “ this is normally done if there are little clarifications that should be asked again. So our panel is ready to answer the questions. We don't expect anything adversarial,\" he said.\nLacierda said the process is no different from hearings conducted in regular courts.\n\"Our panel is really ready. We prepared for this petition for one year, so our lawyers are ready, including Solicitor General Florin Hilbay,\" he said.\n\"We are hoping for a favourable ruling. In any case, rest assured that the government will continue to act in the country's best interest and in accordance with international law,\" he said.\nThe Permanent Court of Arbitration “ not the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) “ is handling the case as Beijing's refusal to take part in proceedings has made automatic arbitration necessary.\nBut despite snubbing the proceedings, Beijing filed a pleading questioning the court's jurisdiction over the case filed by the Philippines in 2013.\nThe arbitral tribunal began hearings on the jurisdiction issue last July 7.\nManila's filing of the case was prompted by China's relentless encroachment on the West Philippine Sea, including its building of artificial islands to strengthen its claim over areas that are clearly within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\nThe artificial islands are believed to be future Chinese air and naval bases.\nBeijing is invoking\"historic rights\" to justify its nine-dash line principle and its provocative actions in disputed waters.\nChina's intention to expand its presence in the West Philippine Sea became clear in 2012 when its maritime surveillance ships prevented the Philippine Navy from arresting Chinese poachers at the Scarborough Shoal.\nAfter a brief standoff between the Chinese and Filipino forces, the poachers were allowed to leave with their illegal harvest of baby sharks, giant clams and endangered corals.\nThe Philippines' Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario told the UN tribunal that Manila began its diplomatic approach to contesting China's position in August 1995 when the latter built structures on Mischief Reef.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T14:12:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
