This next generation of passenger-focused technology will allow America’s Railroad® to deliver a modern passenger railroad that is accessible to all.\n“Amtrak making its platforms more accessible is a great step in our efforts to improve inclusiveness and accessibility for people with disabilities,ultimately helping all Michiganders” Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said. “It’s great to see a Michigan company taking the lead and partnering with Amtrak to improve transportation options for everyone.”\nAmtrak and RLE International of Madison Heights, Mich., developed this setback-shuttle\nplatform from concept, through the design process, to a prototype for installation at the Ann Arbor station. This prototype will remain in use for a two-year test on performance and then Amtrak plans to deploy at other stations.\n“Amtrak’s willingness to invest in the disabled will serve as a benefit to all,” said\nMichigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein. Amtrak’s goal is to provide safe, efficient and comfortable service to all, including providing additional amenities to those passengers who have a disability.\nSource:-Amtrak\nTags: Amtrak Station in Ann Arbor Expands Accessible Boarding , Railway News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T16:57:04.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
