FAA signed off on a \"Finding Of No Significant Impact.\" The agency's evaluation included 820 acres of undeveloped PTI land, including hundreds of acres that will soon connect to the airfield by a taxiway bridge project that is under construction. The airport land is being eyed for large equipment manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier. It might also be marketed to suppliers to those companies that produce a specific part of a plane. Any new aviation tenants would add to major companies at the airport including Honda Aircraft Co., which employs 1,300 at PTI. Kevin Baker , executive director at PTI, said the FAA's approval is significant because it means that whenever a major aviation company wants to locate operations at PTI, \"we've got a good lion's share of the work out of the way.\" The environmental assessment took two years to complete, he said. Baker said the FAA's approval is conditional. Once a company shows interest in locating operations at PTI, the airport will submit an \"alternatives analysis\" and a modification to the environmental assessment. The airport analysis would include the purpose of the project and a specific site where it could be located, he said. \nWant Greensboro/Winston-Salem Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:53:24.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
