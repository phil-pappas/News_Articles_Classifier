Â© Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society \nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe programme is packed with temptations for theater lovers in 2015. Despite inroads made by comedy in recent years, theater still makes up more than 27% of the festival's 3,314 productions. If you have trouble deciding what movie to see on a Saturday night, you'll probably fry some brain circuits choosing from among the 895 shows on from August 7 to 31 -- not even counting the thousands more performances in comedy , cabaret , family entertainment , music, musicals and opera, dance, circus and physical theater. \nThese are the shows that I'll be trying to see. I've looked at companies, performers and directors who can be relied upon to be challenging and entertaining, year after year, as well as a selection of new shows that look tempting. With so many shows to choose from, my list of highlights is bound to be a little bit arbitrary. But so is everyone else's. That's part of the fun of the Edinburgh Fringe - you just have to take the plunge, win some and lose some. \nIf you are still confused, don't worry - there are lots of places and ways to pick up the Edinburgh Buzz, to find out what's hot and what people are talking about once you get there. 2015 Edinburgh Festival Fringe Picks Traverse Theatre \nTraverse, based in Edinburgh, is Scotland's new writing theater.
