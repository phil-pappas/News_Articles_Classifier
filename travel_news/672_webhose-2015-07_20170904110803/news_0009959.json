Heathrow is an extraordinarily valuable national and urban asset. As the UK’s only international air hub, it’s the logical and practical place to expand. Every new destination with regularly scheduled flights at Heathrow supports 3,000 jobs. Growth of Heathrow’s international hub capacity is essential for the long-term resilience of London. \n“By connecting more effectively with other emerging and growing economies, growth at Heathrow supports the UK’s growth. In an increasingly urbanised and globalised age, collaboration and sharing of resources, talent and high-value trade are essential to maintaining our leading position in a competitive global market. \n“The Commission’s finding that there is sufficient demand to justify a second additional runway by 2050 leaves the door open for expansion at Gatwick. Like Heathrow, Gatwick is an airport that is also constrained by lack of runway capacity. \n“The best way forward for London, the region and the country is to allow both Heathrow and Gatwick to expand. These two airports are very specialised, with Heathrow the country's only international hub, and Gatwick the region's premier point-to-point airport. They do very different things, but expansion at both puts UK plc on the strongest footing. Expanding both airports is the most viable way to address the UK’s aviation capacity before London falls further behind its global competitors in Europe and the Middle East. \n“Decades of paralysis by successive governments have led to the current aviation capacity crisis in the South East. Swift, decisive action is now needed. Continuing indecision could stall the UK’s economic growth at the very time the government is seeking to augment it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:14:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
