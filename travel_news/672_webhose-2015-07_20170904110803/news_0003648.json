Australians. Australia has no idea what a burger is. They put a fried egg on their burger. They put canned beetroot on it, like a wedge of it. I am not joking you. This is how they eat their burger,” the web post said.\nMomofuku chef David Chang has ignited controversy.

Get that shit out of there,” he said, adding that you should “save the truffles for a dish you can’t eat at a rest stop”.\nPerry, who offers a Cape Grim burger with Aussie house-made pickled beetroot, didn’t mince his response.\n“I’m not much of an egg man myself and he’s entitled to his opinion,” said Perry who grew up eating Paul’s Famous Hamburgers from Sylvania in the 1960s.\n“But these are the sorts of burgers of Australia’s past.\n“If you look at burgers in America, fast food burgers are ordinary and have a whole lot things on them as well. But there are American burgers that are shit as well.”\nPaul’s Famous Burgers manager and co-owner Chris Sinesiou said the nearly 60-year-old venue, on the Tom Ugly’s Bridge, had won four awards for Australia’s best burgers.\nChris Sinesiou at Paul's Famous Hamburgers in Sylvania.

Hamburgers are pretty much all good,” he said.\nOriginally published as ’Australia, you’re f***ing up hamburgers’", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/077203-a8396fea-2b5c-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/food/star-us-chef-grilled-over-controversial-claim-australians-f-up-hamburgers/story-fnov1g0j-1227444078087", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/077257-d6a0c63a-2b5c-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/16/1227444/078059-3576e1d0-2b5d-11e5-a439-5c856edaa69b.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-16T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T08:06:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
