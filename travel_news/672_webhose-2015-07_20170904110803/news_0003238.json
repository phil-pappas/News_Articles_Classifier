Comment   Dawn Teer Posted Jul. 21, 2015 at 2:50 PM By Dawn Teer Posted Jul. 21, 2015 at 2:50 PM DEWITT — Carly McSwain, daughter of Kevin and Gina McSwain, of DeWitt has an opportunity to do something most little kids only dream of. That opportunity is an internship at Walt Disney World in Florida. The Disney College Internship Program is a paid internship program that McSwain heard about in ninth grade from her English teacher, Sabrina Rogers, who had participated in it. McSwain thought it would be fun to do, but didn’t think much more about it until a few years later, when a friend of hers did it for a whole year. Two more of her friends actually got to participate for a semester as well. Apparently, the program was more well known than she knew. “It is a good opportunity to get your foot in the door at Disney. It is the second most popular internship program in the U.S., behind Google,” McSwain said. It is a fairly difficult process to be selected for the program. Participants must be 18 years of age and in college. McSwain started the process and says, “it’s a long interview process. About 50,000 people apply per semester and only 2,000 are selected.” The interview process started on Jan. 26, and it wasn’t long until she was contacted for a web based interview, then lastly for a phone interview on Jan. 31. In the first part of the interview process, participants apply online and select three areas they are interested in. McSwaim’s were custodial, merchandising and attractions. On the day she found out she got it, she had seen several people who had been accepted and she had started to think she hadn’t been selected. Five minutes before she got off work at Kroger, her phone started playing Disney sounds and a congratulatory message informing her that she had been selected for the program. “I was so happy, I ran up front and showed everyone, then called my mom at work, I tried to sound normal and asked her to come outside and then I told her,” McSwain said. She was selected for custodial, which consists of cleaning up around the park, giving short tours to guests, and playing with kids, which according to McSwain, “the more guest interaction I have the better. One part of the custodial job is making water art with brooms. I saw this done when I was on my senior trip and visiting the park and thought it was so cool.” Disney also provides interns a place to live. They pay rent and have roommates who are also interns. McSwain moves in on Aug. 10, and is scheduled to return Jan. 6, unless she chooses to stay another semester. McSwain says the program is a great resume builder. She has attended PCCUA-DeWitt and was studying wildlife management but says that may change after this internship. After the internship many students pursue careers at Disney. Her recruiter that she met during the interview process has been at Disney over 25 years, and started as an intern.

I know this is the opportunity of a lifetime, but it is hard to think of her being that far from home. Her Dad and I are very proud of her and want her to live the dream,” said her Mom, Gina. McSwain also has a sister, Jessica, who is a detective with the Stuttgart Police Department. McSwain hopes to get to work in the Animal Kingdom part of the park because she loves animals.
