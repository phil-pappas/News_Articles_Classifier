I am looking forward to returning to India after my last trip, though this one will be on business rather than holiday. My office will be located in Chennai 8.2 km away in the Mugalivakkam neighborhood. I am planning on eating dinner outside of the hotel, and would like to get in a bit of sightseeing. If I am travelling to the office in the morning, back to the hotel in the evening, and then out to dinner and back to hotel, all while travelling alone, does it make sense to hire a daily driver rather than calling a taxi each time I need to travel? Company will be paying but I don't want to spend $$$ either.
