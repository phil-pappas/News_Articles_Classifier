A bit of subtle make-up, a new outfit or two or a more thorough overhaul? Perhaps a complete new tech wardrobe? Do you have the enthusiasm to prove that your business could benefit substantially from a professional tech overhaul? Maybe you want to create a more productive and agile workforce, rethink how your company uses mobile technology. You almost certainly want to make sure your business and staff are fully clued up on security and compliance. Keeping your business in tip-top condition is essential in the current market and HP BusinessNow is giving you the chance to give it some essential TLC with a £10,000 HP Technology Makeover competition. HP BusinessNow gives SMEs access to technologies and insights normally only within the grasp of huge behemoths. Technology is a game-changer and by having access to technology solutions selected specifically for your business, you will be able to reboot and run at a faster speed than ever before. Get invaluable access to hardware, software and solutions to help grow your business fast HP BusinessNow provides everything a small business needs to survive, from the latest products and technology solutions that will transform the way you work to inspiring customer stories and industry expert advice which will give you the edge you need to break away from your competition. Customers are more connected than ever before. Research from Nominet found that customers increasingly expect businesses to have a firm grip on technology. In fact, 49pc of shoppers think all businesses should have basic online search facilities. The study showed that consumers would spend more if they could (a) purchase online, (b) browse and research products or services and (c) were offered a click-and-collect service. Moreover, there’s increasingly no such thing as an office space any more, with more and more workers checking in on trains, from home, in airports, anywhere but in front of the water-cooler. HP BusinessNow tech solutions are inspired by these real business challenges, from in-store interactive digital signage and state-of-the-art point-of-sale systems for retail businesses to secure mobile PCs and mobile devices. The competition, which ends on August 31, is free to enter and open to any legally operating small business (which must be operational and post revenue). Submissions will be reviewed and judged on criteria such as business potential for expansion and growth, the need for a makeover in the first place and overall energy, enthusiasm, passion and creativity. Winners will be selected and notified by mail, email and/or phone on or about September 15, 2015 and, in addition to gaining access to custom installation and training for your employees, winners will take part in a HP BusinessNow customer story and video. You’ll also become part of the HP BusinessNow Community, with access to invaluable resources and news about the new style of IT. Put your business in the spotlight and get invaluable access to hardware, software and solutions to help grow your business fast. • For more information and competition entry details visit HP BusinessNow – SMB Technology Solutions Now read on... • The inkjet revival is here • Go global with HP • Technology for business: smarter office, better worker • SMEs at risk as XP stutters along • How HP’s Elite family can solve your business problems • A day in the life of the office printer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:30:24.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
