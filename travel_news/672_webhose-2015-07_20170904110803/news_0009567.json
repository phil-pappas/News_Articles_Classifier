The Butterfly House is now open daily at 10 a.m., with volunteers staffing the facility in the evenings and weekends. The Butterfly House currently features a great stock of butterflies, chrysalis, plants and caterpillars with new ones emerging every day, said Kelly McGowan, horticultural educator at the Botanical Center. \"The Great Spangled Fritillaries are real crowd-pleasers, not only because of their beauty but also because of their inclination to be ‘held’ by visitors,\" said Bakerink. \"All stages of Lepidoptera life cycle are plentiful at the Butterfly House right now. We have more and more docents raising caterpillars and returning them in chrysalis form to the House, helping to keep the population at a good level.\" For more information, visit FriendsoftheGarden.org or Facebook at FriendsoftheGarden/events. The Fishin’ Magicians, well-known nationally and locally for their nature-oriented, educationally entertaining performances, will magically share the world of Lepidoptera, the Latin word for butterflies and moths, with adults and children in their first appearance at this year’s Friends of the Garden Butterfly Festival at Springfield Botanical Gardens. The seventh annual event will be 9 a.m.-3 p.m. on Saturday, July 11, in the gardens. The event is free and open to the public, but donations are appreciated. Husband-and-wife magicians Amy Short and Steve Craig have created their newest show especially for the Butterfly Festival. “It’s not just any garden-variety magic act,” said Lisa Bakerink, president of Friends of the Garden, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the Dr. Bill Roston Native Butterfly House. “Their magic and humor educates audiences about butterflies and caterpillars in an entertaining way. Amy and Steve have been very active in volunteering at the Butterfly House. We are happy to host their show.” Steve Craig will stroll the grounds of Nathanael-Greene/Close Memorial Park performing close-up magic from 9:30-10:30 a.m. and from 11:45-12:45. Steve and Amy’s 30-minute program will begin at 11 a.m. in the East Room of the Springfield-Greene County Botanical Center. Five different storytimes will be held throughout the day, beginning at 10 a.m. with storyteller Emily Alexander from the Brentwood Branch Library followed by Liz Ann Morehart from the Midtown Carnegie Branch Library at 11:30 a.m. and at noon, Naara Keen from the Republic Branch Library. Jeannine Birkenfield from the Brentwood Branch Library will present a storytime at 1 p.m. followed by Cathy Farr from the Library Station at 2. All storytimes will be held in the East Room in the Botanical Center. Other activities include a Caterpillar Petting Zoo, Butterfly, Caterpillar and Pollinator Costume Contests at 10:30 a.m. on the outdoor stage followed by the Pollinator Parade. There will be a display of butterfly-inspired quilt blocks sponsored by the Ozark Peacemakers Quilt Guild in the West Room. Studio 55 will host a display of art featuring butterflies and blooms in the lobby and Botanical Center Coordinator Katie Steinhoff will offer ideas on how to style your landscape to be the perfect host for native butterflies and moths at 9:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. in the workshop studio. Several merchants and vendors, including Flutter & Ozark Reflections, Homestead Iron, Hooks & Stitches, Peggy’s Flowers, Wickman’s Garden Village and Yelp, will display their wares. There will be raffle for a $500 gift card from Smiling Sun Gardens to benefit the Butterfly House. The Butterfly House, Butterfly Garden and Native Caterpillar Café at the 114-acre Springfield-Greene County Park Board-operated public park, 2400 S. Scenic Ave., are sponsored by the Friends of the Garden.
