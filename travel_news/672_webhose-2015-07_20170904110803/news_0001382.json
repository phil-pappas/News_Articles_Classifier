(NASDAQ:SAVE) today reported second quarter 2015 financial results. Adjusted net income for the second quarter 2015 increased 12.6 percent to $74.8 million ($1.03 per diluted share) compared to the second quarter 2014 1 . GAAP net income for the second quarter 2015 increased 18.3 percent year over year to $76.7 million ($1.05 per diluted share). Adjusted pre-tax margin for the second quarter 2015 was 21.3 percent 1 . On a GAAP basis, pre-tax margin for the second quarter 2015 was 21.8 percent. Spirit ended the second quarter 2015 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $769.3 million. Spirit's return on invested capital (before taxes and excluding special items) for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015 was 29.4 percent 2 . \"Our second quarter 2015 performance was negatively impacted by an unusual number of storms and I want to thank our team members and business partners for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers and helping us to restore our operations to normal,\" said Ben Baldanza, Spirit's Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition to an unusual number of storms, we've recently seen a noticeable change in competitive pricing behavior. But, the fundamentals of our business haven't changed: we continue to grow our network while maintaining high margins, delivering strong returns, and offering our customers low fares.\" During June, Spirit experienced consecutive storm systems in Dallas, Chicago, New York, and Detroit followed by Tropical Storm Bill that sat over Houston before moving north to Dallas. The timing and location of these storm systems produced a domino effect on the Company's operation resulting in over 500 flight cancellations and numerous flight delays. Due to the sheer volume of flights affected, the Company was unable to flex up staffing levels enough to mitigate the impact of crews being displaced or being unable to work due to them reaching their contractual or regulatory work hour maximums. These challenges lengthened the span of the irregular operation and the time it took to restore the system to normal. With its high aircraft utilization, low daily flight frequency and point-to-point network, severe irregular operations typically create a unique set of challenges for the Company; however, the Company believes the unusual number and location of storms in June exacerbated the operational difficulty and made this event unlike others. The Company estimates the impact of the cancellations, delays, and other non-recurring expenses during the quarter negatively impacted operating income by $20 million ($5 million lower revenue, $15 million higher costs). Adjusting for these items, the Company estimates it would have reported adjusted net income of $87.5 million ($1.20 per diluted share). 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T13:48:05.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
