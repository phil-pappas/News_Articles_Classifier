This is despite a 3 per cent growth in sales to €6.64 billion. \nCEO Alexandre De Juniac said the first half of this year saw \"exceptional volatility in exchange rates and the fuel price, and by ongoing pressure on unit revenues\". \nEarlier this year, Air France-KLM said it was accelerating cost-cutting measures and today announced it has stuck to its outlook with net debt falling €1 billion over the past 12 months to €4.4 billion. \nThe group said it would increase capacity just 0.6 per cent over the year, compared with a rise of 1.1 per cent predicted earlier this year. \nDe Juniac said: \"The lack of results improvement leads us to implement immediate additional adaptation measures including, in particular, the closure of heavily loss-making routes, the downward revision in capacity for the forthcoming winter season, together with acceleration and an increase in the magnitude of our cost-saving initiatives.\" \nHe also called on Air France-KLM pilots to reach a productivity agreement by the end of September, otherwise even more routes will need to be slashed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T13:19:28.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
