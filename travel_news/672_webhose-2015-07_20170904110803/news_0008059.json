This is the brand’s first zone to capture 100 percent of departing passengers, transforming all three of Dulles International Airport’s security checkpoints. With nearly 22 million travelers passing through the airport yearly, the transformed security checkpoints offer little extras that add up to make the travel experience a lot less ordinary for more passengers than ever before.\n“Extending the hospitality of SpringHill Suites by providing unexpected moments of relief is a priority for us,” said Loren Nalewanski, vice president and global brand manager, SpringHill Suites by Marriott. “Business travel can be tough and our goal is to help travelers start the trip with a unique and stress-free experience as they pass through one of the countries busiest airports.”\nSpringHill Suites Dulles Airport Zone 1The transformed security checkpoints are designed to offer new levels of comfort to airport travelers, while still maintaining the highest levels of security. Pre-screening zones are outfitted with modern yet comfortable seating allowing passengers a moment to prepare to pass through the security checkpoint. Additionally, post-screening re-composure zones replace hard benches with soft, comfortable couches and convenient tables that invite travelers to relax, re-gather their belongings and put their shoes back on after passing through security.\nIn partnership with Washington Dulles International Airport, JCDecaux and Aviator, this is the fifth location where travelers have been treated to a SpringHill Suites Comfort Zone. This is the first time the brand has been able to enhance every security checkpoint located in the airport, including the TSA Pre-Check®. Additional Comfort Zones are still in place at Oakland International Airport and Chicago O’Hare International Airport, providing unique experiences to travelers coast to coast.\n“The partnership between Washington Dulles International Airport, JCDecaux and Marriott to bring a SpringHill Suites Comfort Zone to the airport will create a wonderful opportunity for passengers and continue the tradition of providing world-class service and comfort to our customers,” said Jerome L. Davis, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer.\nRelated Posts Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Art is Everywhere – SpringHill Suites Challenges Americans to Stop and Share Apple Pay Checks In to Marriott – First Hotel Company to Offer the Service to Its Guests Businesses look to travel bookings to help bolster the bottom line, new HRG air data shows Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:12:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
