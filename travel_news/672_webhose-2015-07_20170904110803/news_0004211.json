ET Wednesday, July 22 By PR Newswire | 07/21/15 - 02:18 PM EDT Reprint VALLEY FORGE, Pa. , July 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CertainTeed, North America's leading brand of building products, will bring its cutting-edge insulation and drywall products to eight high-stakes remodeling projects on HOME FREE, a new competition series premiering 9 p.m. ET Wednesday, July 22 , on FOX. With guidance from trusted contractor Mike Holmes , the series will challenge nine couples with renovating eight run-down properties in eight weeks in hopes of winning their dream home. The show will broadcast in the U.S. and Canada . For each project, contestants will use CertainTeed's wall-to-wall product solutions, helping them meet tight project timelines while also ensuring complete indoor comfort in each home for years to come. \"This series is an exciting opportunity to show homeowners that renovation projects involve much more than just changing out cabinets and countertops. The often-overlooked products we choose to put in our walls have a major impact on the overall health and comfort of a home,\" said John Crowe , president and CEO of CertainTeed Corporation. \"As a long-time advocate for healthy homes, Mike Holmes will be the perfect guide for these prospective homeowners, educating them on using the right products for every job.\"During each episode of the new series, Holmes will present the couples with tasks designed to test and challenge the skills of these do-it-yourself enthusiasts. Holmes will be with the competitors every step of the way - critiquing their work and demanding they meet his high standards, while also sharing his expertise and guidance to help them reach new heights. As a surprise twist, when the work is done for the day, the couples don't have far to travel to get homeâ€”because not only must they work together to restore the home, they must all live together in the same dilapidated work site 24/7. The more they accomplish, the better they sleep at night. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:43:34.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
