Russ and Lori highly recommend that at some time, you make a point to visit this beautiful place. The peace and serenity there is like no other. The sunrise and sunset views provide a plethora of highlights to the canyon that you actually have to be there to experience. The Grand Canyon is in the northwest corner of Arizona, close to the borders of Utah and Nevada. The Colorado Rivers flows gracefully down the Grand Canyon, and has a wide variety of river conditions from mild to wild. The 277 mile canyon separates the park into the South and North Rims. The deepest part of the canyon is a mind boggling one mile down from the rim. The north and south rims have different camping conditions, due to the differences in elevation. The climate can be quite different from one rim to another. Research and choose which side you would like to camp at, as it is a 220-mile, five-hour drive from the north to south rims. Russ and Lori recommend visiting one side of the canyon per visit. The South Rim of The Grand Canyon is open all year, and is located on the \"Arizona\" side of the canyon. Ninety percent of visitors choose the South Rim. Out of Williams, Arizona, The South Rim is only a 90 minute ride from Interstate 40. The North Rim is slightly more of a remote location. The North Rim gets only about 10 percent of the park’s visitors and is located 30 miles south of Jacob, Utah, on Highway 67. Let’s explore some of the camping areas that The Grand Canyon has to offer. For a more remote experience, visit The North Rim Campground. This campground is just two miles from The Bright Angel Point. This is a great campground if you plan on hiking to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Keep in mind that the trail is a difficult 14.2 miles. The hike down is hard on the calves; the hike up is steep and tiring. Be prepared and be sure you are up to this hike. Reserve a camping site as soon as you have a tentative date. For South Rim camping, Russ and Lori recommend The Desert View campground. We feel it is the most picturesque camping on The South Rim. It is an amazing sunrise spot. This campground is located 25 miles east of Grand Canyon Village. Reserve early, as there are only 50 spots available. Keep in mind that there are several campgrounds within a reasonable drive to The Grand Canyon Rim. Camping depends on if you want to stay as close to the canyon as possible, or do not mind a drive of up to 90 miles each way. Want to experience a tour of The Grand Canyon and are not sure how to take it all in? All-Star Grand Canyon Tours offers a comfortable ride and guide to explore The South Rim. This includes a friendly and knowledgeable guide, seats in a comfortable van, snacks, drinks, and even a gourmet lunch. Grand Canyon Airlines offers another way to view the canyon using a twin-engine propeller aircraft that will fly you over the canyon, Rainbow Bridge, Lake Powell, and Glen Canyon Dam. This can be a bit expensive for a family, as prices start at about $145 for a 35-minute flight, but the views are spectacular. Russ and Lori have an overall camping favorite for visiting The Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon Railway RV Park is situated in Williams, Arizona. This is a great place to unwind and relax. The campground is spotless, with full hook-up sites for even the largest RV's. Each space has high definition TV access, wireless internet, and a nice indoor swimming pool and spa is available. There is a common picnic area with gas grills and a fire pit. There are even coin-operated laundry machines available. From The Grand Canyon RV Park, you can ride The Grand Canyon Railway to The South Rim. This railway has been in use since 1901. The railcars are retro, perfectly restored, and offer a peaceful view of the landscape and forests that lead to The Grand Canyon. No stress from driving, just enjoy the ride. There are several packages from an up and back day trip, to staying at The South Rim for a few days. Prices are reasonable, and your RV is the perfect balance for whatever package you choose. Visit the Grand Canyon, you will never forget it. So, Let’s Get Rollin’!
