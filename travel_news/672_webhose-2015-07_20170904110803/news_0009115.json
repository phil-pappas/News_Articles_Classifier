Cara! Cara! Cara!” the mostly teenage crowd chanted as Cara Delevingne made her way down the red carpet at the New York premiere of Paper Towns last night. The way they were screaming, you’d have thought it was Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who were about to appear on the scene. But, no, it was Delevingne, being greeted by some of her 15.8 million Instagram fans who were there to support the model-turned-actress in her first big film debut.\n“I don’t want anyone to think this is a fluke or I got this because of my social media or something—I work really hard,” said Delevingne, who wore a sparkling Saint Laurent number (20th Century Fox and YSL Rouge Pur Couture hosted the premiere). She plays Margo in the movie, which is based on the young adult novel by John Green of The Fault in Our Stars fame. In between taking a few selfies with fans and hugging her friends Karlie Kloss and Joan Smalls, Delevingne revealed that it’s nonfiction that most inspires her: “For me, at the moment, factual books are the things I love most, because I live in a fantasy world.”\nHer costar, Nat Wolff, told Style.com, “Cara is just a really good actress and I hope people can go in without preconceived notions like I did.” He added, “I didn’t really know who she was.” Few people will be able to say that in the months to come—Delevingne’s upcoming credits include Suicide Squad , Pan , Kids in Love , London Fields , and Tulip Fever .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-23T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:03:27.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
