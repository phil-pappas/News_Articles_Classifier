The sun is out, there is a gentle wind, and the course is a picture: undulating fairways speckled with gorse and heather. But Andy, my Scottish playing companion, is less sanguine. “The haar is coming this way,” he says, pointing out to sea, sunlit, but with a slight haze on the horizon. I have always loved this word – an old term for a cold sea fog – since I first came across it in a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. But this is the first time I have encountered a haar on a golf course. Andy’s local knowledge proves spot on. By the time we get to the 10th hole, the haar has come swirling in from the sea, blotting out the sun. By the 18th, visibility is down to 100yd. It is like a scene from The Hound of the Baskervilles. • Darren Clarke's 10 favourite links courses My tee shot disappears into the fog, and that is the last I see of my ball. It could be anywhere between Dundee and Edinburgh. “Haar-bloody-haar,” I think, as I mark my card. But then links golf wouldn’t be links golf without Mother Nature intervening in some cruel and capricious way. It is usually the wind that plays havoc, howling off the sea, making low scoring impossible. Or perhaps those notoriously bumpy fairways. A haar is a devilish new ingredient in the brew. But what a beautiful brew links golf is: the oldest, purest, most romantic form of the game. Kingsbarns, which co-hosts the Dunhill Links Championship every autumn, is a comparatively new course, but it is following a great tradition. And as the 2015 Open returns to St Andrews, the granddaddy of links courses, it is time again to play homage to this most British of sporting institutions. The morning after my haar-affected round at Kingsbarns, I am at the famous Old Course at St Andrews at first light, hoping to take advantage of a last-minute cancellation. No joy. The first tee is jam-packed with visiting Americans and Japanese and first-year students at St Andrews University, skipping lectures in biomedical sciences. But I manage to walk the entire course before breakfast, marvelling at its myriad charms. • St Andrews holds special place in the heart of champions It looks so innocent and picturesque, with the beach on one side and the old town on the other. Joggers and dog-walkers make their way through the dunes, their faces wreathed in smiles. Gulls glide in from the sea. There is a tang of salt in the air. But, on the course itself, there are perils sadly familiar to golfers: clumps of gorse; vast, curving greens; and – most lethal of all – those deep pot bunkers, waiting for errant drives. I watch sadistically as an American takes three shots to emerge from one, his grunts of frustration getting louder and louder. Nothing on the manicured fairways of Florida has prepared him for the exquisite torture of an old-fashioned British links. Aficionados of links golf can be as choosy as wine connoisseurs. They know what they like, and they will harrumph into their whiskies at the 19th hole if you make the schoolboy error of assuming that a seaside golf course is automatically a links course. It ain’t. • The world's 10 best golf courses In their classic book True Links, George Peper and Malcolm Campbell argued that, of the world’s 30,000-odd golf courses, only 246 could truly be classified as links courses – the vast majority in the British Isles. The point about links courses, say the authors, is that they have evolved. They are not the product of designers and bulldozers, but follow the natural topography of the land linking the sea and the arable land farther from the shore. The fairways should be sand-based and fast-running, with bunkers galore but no trees, ideally, and certainly no artificial water hazards – just the odd natural stream, like the famous Swilcan Burn at St Andrews. The out-and-out purist – probably to be found in the committee room at the R &  A, still in a state of shock after the club voted to admit women last year – will further insist that the first nine holes should run in the same direction away from the clubhouse and the second nine back in the opposite direction. But that is a quibble. Who wins the 2015 Open will be in the lap of gods, as always. But long before the Valley of Sin on the 18th, they will have had to outsmart not just their opponents but the ancient Scottish landscape – pretty as a picture, but with bumps in all the wrong places. Max Davidson travelled as a guest of Glenmorangie ( glenmorangie.com ), the official spirit of The Open Golf Championship. He stayed at the Fairmont St Andrew’s ( standrewsbay.com ) which offers a night’s stay including 36 holes of golf on its Torrance and Kittocks Courses from £145 per person – this rate applies to Sunday night stays off season. Green fee at Kingsbarns ( kingsbarns.com ) £226. How to play the Old Course at St Andrews It's fully booked this year. For a guaranteed tee time you need to plan up to a year in advance. From August 26 until September 14, the Links Trust (which administers the course) will be accepting bookings for 2016 . However, about 50 per cent of all starting times are put into a ballot that is drawn daily for the next day’s play (the Saturday draw is for play on the following Monday). Your chances vary according to the time of year and the weather. A minimum of two golfers can enter by telephone, or in person before 2pm on the day before play. Names, home clubs and handicaps are required. The results are shown by 4pm online. Singles should approach the starter in the morning and he will try to join the golfer with the first available two-ball or three-ball. Visitor times: The Old Course is closed on Sundays, but otherwise open to visitors unless a tournament is being held. Green fee: £80-£170, depending on the time of year. Handicap limit: Men 24, ladies 36. Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:47:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
