Orlando, FL, July 29, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Against a backdrop of increasing medical travel to private facilities for diagnostic treatment and care, proactive and forward-thinking leaders from the most dynamic hospitals and clinics in Latin America and beyond will return for a second year to identify emerging international Centers of Excellence and offer solutions for the delivery of healthcare and medical insurance services during the 2015 Bupa Global Providers Summit. The summit on Sunday, Sept. 27, 2015 will be held in conjunction with the 8th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015 -- at the Orange County Convention Center, in Orlando, Fla., the Medical Tourism Association® and Bupa Global announced today.“Private healthcare markets are expanding throughout the world, but, perhaps, nowhere as fast as those in emerging countries,” said Dr. Edison Vallejo, Director of Health & Benefits at Bupa Global in Latin America, the health insurer of some 14 million customers in more than 190 countries. “With a growing mobile population, innovative insurance products and elimination of access barriers to quality healthcare, patients are increasingly seeking treatment in international markets that are better able to provide the higher level of service desired.”Renée-Marie Stephano, president of the Medical Tourism Association®, said the Bupa Summit –“Clinical Quality as a Differentiator in International Healthcare” -- provides a platform for healthcare consumers and providers to candidly exchange insights and share lessons learned -- from bundled pricing and affordable healthcare services to hospital performance and quality programs.“Although private healthcare markets are ripe for growth, the high costs and the wide variations in pricing involved with emerging medical technologies can be confusing and constraining,” she said. “Our ongoing relationship with Bupa Global and participation in this Summit offers a much-needed forum for healthcare providers and insurers to clear the air and formulate strategies that allow consumers to take more effective ownership and stewardship of their health.”For information about summit speakers and topics as well as registration information, visit http://www.medicaltourismcongress.com/bupasummit/, or contact Cristina Cardona, executive global program manager, 001-561-792-6676, or Info@MedicalTourismCongress.comAbout Bupa GlobalBupa Global is the international health insurance arm of Bupa, serving over 2.1 million customers around the world.
