It is the beginning of Thailand's monsoon season but the cloudless sky shows me that rain remains far off. Before getting sunburned, I seek shelter. In front of an elegant white building, I hesitate to enter, but my exhausted body warns me that it cannot cope with this afternoon heat any longer. So, I decide to walk in. Once stepping inside, I find myself in a hall with a high ceiling. Two flights of steps on both sides lead to the upper floor, with teak floor walkways to different rooms. \n\"Welcome to our museum\", says guide Anchalee Srikanya, greeting me with a smile. \nThe compact museum in the atmospheric building is well laid out, with plenty of interesting exhibits. Its modern interior impresses all museumgoers at first sight. Spending an afternoon here is not such a bad idea, I think. \nGuide Anchalee Srikanya with some luntaya acheik cloth. \nThe Lanna Folklife Museum features 18 exhibition rooms displaying items concerned with religious custom, temple paraphernalia and symbolism, and explains traditional crafts of people from the North, which are fading out in the modern day. No, it is not boring as the exhibits are presented in a modern format. Guests can touch certain displayed items such as local ingredients, decorative items or some life-size models. \nThe first couple of rooms introduce me to the basic architecture of Lanna-style Buddhist temples, decorative stuccoes, related ceremonies and the activities of people who considered Buddhist temples as the centre of their lives, from birth until death. \nYou can see examples of how the North celebrates Songkran. On display are tung , or northern-style flags, which are used for decoration, and various Buddha images. The famous delicate mural at Wat Phra Singh is displayed here. \nThe museum gradually tells stories about influences from nearby kingdoms over Lanna, cosmology and beliefs that shaped Chiang Mai as it is today. What I find interesting are stories about folklife which are fading away as the city modernises. The museum features details of local musical instruments, cuisine and lifestyle. \n\"A Lanna man interests a lady by visiting her in the evening after dinner time,\" says Anchalee. \"The lady shows off her excellent skills by offering cuisine and betel nuts. During the conversation, it is the chance for a man to show his wit and intelligence. Normally, a man does not develop a relationship with a lady from the same village, reasoning that all villagers know each other too well. So, he goes to interest ladies at villages nearby instead. Of course, he carries a knife or sword for self-defence when travelling, but hides the weapon outside before entering the lady's home. \n\"This room shows collections of wooden boxes in Lanna traditional style. After marriage, a man will make a box as a gift for the wife. The craftsmanship of the box shows how much he loves his wife.\" \nOne of the lacquer pieces on display. They were made in Myanmar and reflect cultural blends that once influenced Chiang Mai. The delicate lacquer items also mirror the status of the owners. \nBesides various sets of betel containers and the utensils of commoners and rulers, fine silver ornaments and exquisite embroidered works, an interesting item is a colourful tube skirt that belonged to Chiang Mai-born Chao Dara Rasmi, who was Princess Consort of King Rama V. \n\"The tube skirt is handwoven with a luntaya acheik pattern, which originated in present-day Myanmar,\" she says. \nI learn later that this pattern was once popular in Myanmar's royal courts. The distinctive wave-like pattern sometimes includes floral appendages and is often found in striking colour combinations. They are now some of the most sought after textiles by collectors. \nThe last room in this museum, probably the most unique one, is the courtroom. It is well maintained, as it was before it was transformed into the modern museum. \nOriginally, the site where this museum is situated was a teak city hall owned by Prince Uparat Suriya (who later became King Intharawarorot Suriyawong, the 8th King of Chiang Mai's Chet Ton Dynasty). \nA new city hall was built on another side of the road in 1919. The government bought this piece of land and built Chiang Mai Provincial Court in 1935. Though it is a small museum, its interesting presentations give you a clearer picture of Chiang Mai's spirit. Lanna Folk Museum opens Tuesday to Sunday, 8.30am-5pm. Admission is 90 baht for adults, and 40 baht for children. Visit www.cmocity.com or call 053-217-793. \nLanna Folklife Museum.
