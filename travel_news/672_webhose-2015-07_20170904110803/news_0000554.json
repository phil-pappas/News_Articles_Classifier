Chicago ad shops could very… more American Airlines , now the world's largest airline, got the immediate attention of a lot of Chicago ad agencies this week when it said it is launching an ad agency review. Though American has worked with the New York-based McCann Group and its Dallas affiliate TM Advertising for more than 30 years — the equivalent of several centuries in the ad industry of today — the launch of an agency review isn't entirely surprising given where AA is at this moment in its history. American (NASDAQ: AAL) is just about to complete a multi-year integration with U.S. Airways, a brand name that will disappear for good in October. The combined airlines are now run by former U.S. Airways CEO Doug Parker , who, of course, wants to make sure his stamp is imprinted on every facet of the giant carrier he now manages. And that includes marketing. So the agency review is just beginning. Incumbent McCann already has indicated it will compete to hold on to the business. But beyond that, the field of contenders is open. Way, way open in Chicago, where no local ad shop has any airline account. And hasn't had one for quite some time. Even Chicago-based United Airlines , when it changed agencies several years ago, went with the New York office of McGarryBowen, not its Chicago outpost. Though airlines nowadays tend not to be big spenders when it comes to advertising (the AA ad account most recently is said to total around $30 million in billings), they are the kind of businesses just about every ad agency would want in their portfolio, because airlines are high-profile, and, on a good day, can be kind of sexy — though don't ask anyone who flies regularly to get on board with that observation. Perhaps the most likely contender to vie for the AA ad account in Chicago would be Leo Burnett . The agency's former Chief Creative Officer Susan Credle said before she departed last month that she wanted to get the Southwest Airlines account when that carrier was shopping around for a new agency several years ago. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly went with TBWA/Chiat/Day in Los Angeles, though longtime Southwest agency partner GSD&M in Austin, Tex., also continues to work on advertising for the low fare behemoth. FCB Chicago , which had a big run of wins at the just-ended Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, might push to be considered too, as would DDB Chicago, which has been eager for some time to add to its roster of blue chip accounts. DDB had worked with AA globally (that is everywhere but the U.S.) until 2003, when McCann got the global business too. The Chicago offices of Burnett, FCB and DDB are each part of an extensive global agency network, which probably will be a requirement for whatever agency wins the AA business, given that the airline now has such a vast global reach. Ultimately, though, it's going to come down to chemistry and creativity. If a Chicago ad agency is to win the AA advertising account, it will have to present a team that — most importantly — clicks with Parker and his top marketing honcho Fernand Fernandez. And just important, if a Chicago ad shop is to win the business, it will have to be clever about what kind of work it uses to pitch the business. Last year, AA introduced a \"Going For Great\" ad campaign from McCann that was less of a brand effort, and more of an informational campaign talking about the many ways AA had begun to upgrade every aspect of its operations during the merger process. But now AA needs to start thinking about a long-term brand positioning that will clearly separate it from the competition. That no doubt will be a big part of the job of whatever agency wins the review. AA's decision on an agency is expected by October. \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
