Check out the Telegraph Student Writers blog here. The end of the academic year has arrived. Seven months ago, the Telegraph Student Life section launched a blog, and, ever since, student writers from across the country have been regularly contributing From articles extolling the virtues of rowing at university, to those discussing the nature of student politics, there have been many topics covered. We've had amusing advice about holiday resolutions, tips on dealing with the infamous quarter life crisis and an examination of exam pressure and mental health. And that's just the start. Over the summer we will continue to publish articles, giving those who want to contribute, a voice on the Telegraph. Those who have yet to contribute – and who want to contribute – can continue to apply using the form supplied here . To celebrate the pieces submitted by our writers, we have launched a competition in partnership with Amazon Student . We are looking for the best article of the term (any articles published on the blog between March 27, 2015 and August 6, 2015) and entries will be judged on which are the most original, interesting and entertaining. The winning blog will receive a Kindle Fire HD 7 . To be in with a chance, current writers should submit their best Telegraph Student Writers blog piece via the form below, filling out all the required fields. You are also required to give a brief description (no more than 100 words) as to why you chose to write your selected piece. Writers should submit one piece only. If more than one piece is submitted, we will take the first submission from each student writer. I will be judging entries along with Malcolm Coles, Director of Digital Media at the Telegraph, and all entries must be received by midnight on Friday August 7, 2015. A winner will be notified by Friday August 21, 2015. Best of luck with your applications and, if you haven't already, check out the blog here .
