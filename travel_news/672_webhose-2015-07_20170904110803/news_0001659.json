But the City Council appears to have skirted open-meetings rules by relinquishing its option on the back half of the Wayne Golf Course behind closed doors.\nThe brouhaha galvanized residents already frustrated by a costly City Hall, the slow pace of downtown revitalization efforts and paralyzing traffic congestion.\nUltimately, a deal was made to preserve the open space — Freed agreed in June to sell it back. The flap also increased citizen engagement, inspiring a new generation of civic leaders.\nAMONG those new leaders is James McNeal , co-founder and president of the OneBothell civic group and a candidate for Bothell City Council Position No. 4.\nThe Times recommends: James McNeal\nBothell City Council Position 4\nStrengths : Leadership; experience as a construction manager; advocacy for Bothell\nMcNeal is the best candidate in this race because of his leadership, experience as a construction manager and advocacy for Bothell locally and with other jurisdictions recruited to preserve the open space. ...\"\nMcNeal is the best candidate in this race because of his leadership, experience as a construction manager and advocacy for Bothell locally and with other jurisdictions recruited to preserve the open space.\nThose attributes and his commitment to make Bothell a more transparent and careful steward of its assets outweigh concerns about his past legal troubles, including a DUI and tax-payment problems when his small business flailed before the recession.\nIf elected, McNeal should work to ensure that he represents all quarters of Bothell.\nVOTERS may be ready for a fresh start after all the turbulence at Bothell City Hall. But in the race for City Council Position No. 2, incumbent Andy Rheaume should be elected to another term.\nThe Times recommends:", "external_links": ["http://oi47.tinypic.com/a9l0g3.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-13T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T06:31:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
