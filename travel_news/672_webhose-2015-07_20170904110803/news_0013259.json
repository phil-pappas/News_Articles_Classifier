Each year, readers of Ultratravel UK vote for their preferred travel suppliers – everything from hotels to cruise lines. On May 31, 2015 Whistler was voted Best Ski Resort in the World from the reader survey. There are only 20 ULTRAs voted for and presented each year.\n“We are excited that Whistler has been recognised, for the second year in a row, by readers of Ultratravel magazine as the best ski resort in the world,” said Barrett Fisher, Tourism Whistler’s President & CEO.\n“It is quite an honour for the resort – and a huge compliment for our many businesses and partners – to receive this prestigious award,” she said. “Tourism Whistler would like to thank our many member businesses who continue to strive for the very best in customer service, helping to elevate our overall guest experience and drive such impressive results.”\nAlso in June, Tourism Whistler, which operates whistler.com, the official website and central reservations for the resort, was recognized by Travelzoo, receiving their award for Best Deals from a Destination Marketing Organization (Canada).\nTravelzoo is a global Internet media company and their awards recognize companies that provide the best travel and entertainment deals. “The Travelzoo Award is the ultimate stamp of approval. The winners go above and beyond to create experiences that surprise and delight our 27 million members,” said Travelzoo CEO Chris Loughlin in announcing the awards.\nThe ULTRA and Travelzoo awards follow a string of recent accolades for the resort and various local businesses so far in 2015, including:\nLuxury Travel Magazine – Best Overseas Ski Resort: Whistler\nSKI Magazine – Best Ski Resort in North America: Whistler\nTrip Advisor – Best Canadian Destination (top 10)\nCondé Nast Traveller – Best Resorts in Canada (top 15)\no Four Seasons Resort Whistler (4)\no Pan Pacific Mountainside (10)\no Fairmont Chateau Whistler (12)\nWorld Snow Awards – Eco Award: Whistler Blackcomb\nThe Georgia Straight’s 2015 Golden Plates Awards\no Araxi Restaurant + Bar – Best Resort Restaurants (second place)\no The Wildflower Restaurant – Best Resort Restaurants (third place)\no Araxi Restaurant + Bar – Best Whistler Restaurants (first place)\no Bearfoot Bistro – Best Whistler Restaurants (second place)\no RimRock Café – Best Whistler Restaurants (third place)\nWorld Ski Awards\no Whistler Blackcomb – Canada’s Best Ski Resort Nominees\no Pan Pacific Whistler Mountainside – Canada’s Best Ski Hotel Nominees\no Four Seasons Resort & Residences Whistler – Canada’s Best Ski Hotel Nominees\no The Fairmont Chateau Whistler – Canada’s Best Ski Hotel Nominees\no Summit Lodge Boutique Hotel – Canada’s Best Ski Boutique Hotel Nominees\no Adara Hotel Whistler – Canada’s Best Ski Boutique Hotel Nominees\no Nita Lake Lodge – Canada’s Best Ski Boutique Hotel Nominees\no Pan Pacific Whistler Village Centre – Canada’s Best Ski Boutique Hotel Nominees\no Sundial Boutique Hotel – Canada’s Best Ski Boutique Hotel Nominees\nReaders Choice Best of Vancouver Awards, Georgia Straight\no Whistler – Best Weekend Getaway (first place)\no Whistler – Best Winter Destination (first place)\no Whistler – Best Place to Buy a Vacation Home (first place)\no Whistler – Best out-of-town Spa Getaway (first place)\no Ziptrek Ecotours – Best BC Adventure Tour Company (first place)\no Whistler – Best Romantic Hideaway (second place)\no Cornucopia – Best BC Wine Festival/Event: (third place)\no Fairmont Chateau Whistler – Best Resort/Hotel in Whistler (first place)\no Four Seasons Resort Whistler – Best Resort/Hotel in Whistler (second place)\no Westin Resort & Spa Whistler – Best Resort/Hotel in Whistler (third place)\nGogobot – Top Winter Destination: Whistler (top 20)\nWhere Vancouver Annual Where to Dine Awards – Whistler:\no Earls Kitchen + Bar – Casual Dining:\no Longhorn Saloon & Grill – Après-Ski\no Araxi Restaurant + Bar – Fine Dining\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Lisa Lewis Joins Associated Luxury Hotels As National Sales Manager In The U.S. West Region Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels Whistler is the best – SKI Magazine readers rank resort number one in North America", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T01:21:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
