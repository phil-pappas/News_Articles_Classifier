Sheldon Dutes reports. (Published Friday, July 24, 2015) Updated 3 hours ago Part of LaGuardia International Airport lost power for hours Friday morning after workers accidentally cut a cable feeding electricity to a terminal, causing more than 100 cancellations and flight delays topping three hours, authorities say. Terminal C and parking lots 4 and 5 lost power when contractors accidentally cut a feeder cable at about 4:30 a.m., the Port Authority said. Generators provided power to the terminal throughout the morning as utility crews worked to restore power; the effort to restore power, which had been cut to Delta's communication systems, the jet bridges leading from the terminal to the airplanes and two parking lots, was still ongoing at noon. Delta flights saw the most adverse affects of the power outage, including more than 100 cancellations and arrival delays of up to three hours. The airline said it was working on fee waivers for passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled because of the outage. Top News Photos of the Week US Airways, which also uses the terminal, wasn't affected. Residual delays were expected throughout the early afternoon. Passengers are advised to to check with their airlines to see if their flight is affected.
