In the past two years, U.S. airlines earned a combined $19.7 billion. \nThis year could lead to even higher profits thanks to a massive drop in the price airlines pay for jet fuel, their single highest expense. In April, U.S. airlines paid $1.94 a gallon, down 34 percent from the year before. \nAnd that's what worries Wall Street analysts and investors. \nHistorically, cheap fuel has led airlines to make money-losing decisions. They would rapidly expand, launching new routes and setting unrealistically low airfares to lure passengers. Airlines that already flew those routes would match the fare, and all carriers would lose money. \nSuch price wars are long gone, but today's low fuel costs along with recent comments from airline executives have given the market jitters. \nAirline stocks plunged in May after the chief financial officer of Southwest said at an industry event that the carrier would increase passenger-carrying capacity by 7percent to 8 percent, an increase over an earlier target. \nWolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay, who hosted that May 19 conference, told investors in a note afterward that the big airlines are unhappy to be restraining growth while low-cost airlines like Spirit grow at a much faster pace. He urged the major airlines in a note to investors to “step up” and cut routes for the good of the industry. \n“This is a Mexican Standoff. Four airlines with guns pointed at each other. Each is afraid to cut suddenly profitable routes because they fear another will backfill that route,” he wrote. “Airlines keep those routes under the rationale that it's good for the long term. This is literally the exact opposite of capacity discipline.” \nOn June 1, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said his airline would cap its 2015 growth at 7 percent. That sparked a rally in airline stocks, as investors were more assured that capacity growth would be limited. \nKeay said on Wednesday that he had not been contacted by the government and doesn't think the airlines have been acting inappropriately. \n“The analyst community is bringing up the subject. You certainly can't fault an airline executive for responding to the question,” Keay said. “The capacity continues to grow at the airports people want to fly to and air travel remains a particular good value for the consumer, especially for the utility that it provides.” \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T23:21:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
