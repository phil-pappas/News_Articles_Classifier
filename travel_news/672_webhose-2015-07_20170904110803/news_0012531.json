The arrival of the great Cunard ocean liner will be marked by a flotilla of historic ships and Coast Guard vessels, including the Mary A Whalen ,an oil tanker; the Eric R Thornton , tug boat; John J Harvey Fireboat ; Nantucket Lightship , and the Pegasus Tug after she passes under the Verrazano Bridge at approximately 5:30 am and berths alongside the Red Hook Terminal at 7:15 am . This culmination will be the end of a journey that pays tribute to the original voyage made by Cunard's first flagship, Britannia, as the company inaugurated the first scheduled mail and passenger service across the Atlantic on 4 July 1840 . Cunard has been sailing in and out of New York City ever since the Hibernia first called in 1847, and the company is very proud to call Red Hook Brooklyn its home since 2006. Sites of the company's earlier history and its relationship to the city can be seen through the Cunard White Star sign at Pier 54 and the Cunard Building at 25 Broadway, which was completed in 1921 and is considered a New York City landmark today. \"Cunard's relationship with the city of New York holds a distinctly unique place in our 175-year history,\" said Richard Meadows , president, Cunard North America . \"From the great period of emigration in the mid-19 th and early 20 th century, when Cunard carried approximately one in five emigrants from the old World to North America , many to Ellis Island , to the transportation of hundreds of thousands of military troops across the Atlantic during World War II, New York has been our U.S. homeport for decades, and has played a significant role in the transformative world events during our history. We are very pleased today to extend our heartfelt thanks for our enduring relationship with this great city.\" New York Stock Exchange In the afternoon, Cunard's 175 th anniversary will be marked by the ringing of the Closing Bell at the New York Stock Exchange by the master of Queen Mary 2 , Captain Kevin Oprey , as a testament to the economic and industrial achievements of the company, as well as to the future of the brand. \"Cunard is pleased to contribute to the growing success, visibility and economic impact of the city and to be a part of New York's growing cruise business, which attracts international visitors from across the globe,\" Meadows added. Queen Mary 2 Light Show Spectacular Later in the evening, a spectacular light and music show, designed by the acclaimed Quantum Theatricals , will mark the finale as Queen Mary 2 embarks on her return journey back across the Atlantic. The show, which will be cast over the ship, illuminating New York harbor and the sky above, will bring viewers on a fantastic journey through Cunard's 175 years of history, as well as celebrate the future that lies ahead. This production will begin at approximately 9:30 pm as Queen Mary 2 holds position in front of the Statue of Liberty, and will be available for public viewing from Battery Park.
