Angela Scanlon 06 July 2015 03:00 AM\nBut now her schedule looks set to get even busier as she revealed she has a top-secret new TV series in the pipeline.\nThe flame-haired presenter (31) told the Diary she's back working with RTE on a \"challenging\" new show.\nAs filming has yet to start, the Voice UK digital presenter was keeping tight-lipped on the details of her new project, but she hinted she will be getting up close and personal with celebrities.\n\"I'm doing a documentary series for RTE2 and we've just secured some really good names,\" Angela told the Diary.\n\"I can't say who they are because it's still in the early stages but there's going to be some people that I love personally and I think viewers are going to love getting a bit of insight into them, too.\"\nThe fashionista, who previously presented Reality Bites, said her new gig is like nothing she has ever worked on.\n\"It feels like territory I haven't explored yet,\" she said\nterrifying\n\"It's always good when a project is a bit challenging and maybe a bit terrifying,\" she added.\nAngela can't wait to get working on the show - which will begin filming soon - though she admitted she will have to play it cool while working with some of her heroes.\n\"With social media there is a sense that you know these people already, so sometimes you can feel a little over familiar with them,\" she said.\n\"You kind of feel like you know them because you've seen pictures of their bathroom that they've posted. I'm going to try to be cool but knowing me that probably won't happen.\"\nLast week, Angela revealed she will be presenting BBC3's festival coverage for top Scottish music event T in the Park.\n\"I'm a big festival fan but I've never been to T in the Park so I'm looking forward to it. The line-up is incredible and there's a lot of artists that I'm really into.\n\"We'll be on Friday, Saturday and Sunday live in the evening and that will include anything interesting that may have happened during the day so I think there'll be an opportunity to get around and catch some of the acts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T16:47:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
