(AP) -- The middle of summer looked like the middle of winter in the mountains of western Wyoming. A cold front that moved through Monday afternoon dumped heavy rain on the valleys and snow above 9,000 feet. Officials at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort say they saw the storm coming and shut down their tram before it hit. Resort spokeswoman Anna Olson says to her knowledge nobody got in trouble in the snowy weather. She says an inch accumulated at most but some stuck around until Tuesday. Photos of the snow posted by the resort on Facebook triggered excitement among skiers - with four months to go yet until ski season. Olson says snow in July isn't unheard of but she hasn't seen it for several years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T04:08:54.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
