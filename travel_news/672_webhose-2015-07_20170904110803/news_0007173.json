A significant volume of research is produced by academics that, if presented appropriately, might prompt practitioners to re-think some of their practices or help them answer some of the questions that challenge them from time-to-time”. \nABPCO’s Caroline Windsor introduced the event by stating that gaining access to research produced in universities was one of ABPCO’s five priorities and the links between ABPCO and leading Universities has never been stronger. \n“We recently undertook a poll of our members and this issue came out top,” said Caroline. “There is a thirst for more knowledge and we hope that this collaboration will help create a flow of useful research to help quench it”. \nA finalised subject for the research will now be decided upon based on the needs and wants of the industry following this initial meeting. \nUniversities taking part in the research include: \n· Leeds Beckett University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:53:18.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
