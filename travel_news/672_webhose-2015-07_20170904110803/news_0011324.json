A total of 484 cholera cases, including 29 deaths - six of them children under five - had been reported by the end of June in South Sudan, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. \nAt least 29 people have died in a cholera outbreak in war-torn South Sudan with thousands more at risk of infection, the United Nations said Friday. 5000 children under the age of five are at risk of dying. \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and aid workers are carrying out cholera vaccination campaigns. South Sudan's health ministry declared a outbreak of the disease on June 23, when the number killed hit 18. \nThe outbreak is believed to have begun in early June in crowded UN bases in the capital Juba and then spread to other parts of the city. \nOver 140,000 people have sought shelter in U.N. camps across the country during 18 months of civil war", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T12:53:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
