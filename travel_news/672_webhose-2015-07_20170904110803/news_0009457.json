Shed's mission is to celebrate and nurture the connection between good farming, good cooking and good eating. Shed is the vision of Doug Lipton and Cindy Daniel, of Healdsburg. (Susan Tripp Pollard/Bay Area News Group) Related Stories Inn-Escapable: Two great Healdsburg hotels Sonoma's wine country offers an abundance of riches. Vineyards unfurl across these rolling hills. Redwoods dot the valleys. And the laid-back charms of Healdsburg send a siren call, wafted on warm breezes and scented with lavender. \nBoutiques and bistros line the streets. Inns and B&Bs abound. More than 30 wine-tasting rooms lie within a few blocks' walk, and every restaurant looks more tempting than the last. Cocktails at Spoonbar? Cabernet-infused fries at Partake? Sundaes at Noble Folk Ice Cream & Pie Bar? \nTurn the page and join us. The exterior of the Shed restaurant is seen on North Street in Healdsburg on July 21, 2015. (Kristopher Skinner/Bay Area News Group) It's impossible to sample all of Healdsburg's treasures in a single jaunt, but center your explorations around the town's charming square and let the day unfold. And after you've spent a few hours wine tasting and boutique hopping, the tree-shaded benches on the lush green plaza will be the perfect spot to catch your breath. Here, you can leaf through your latest literary treasure -- or beachy best-seller -- from Copperfield's Books, accompanied perhaps by a Noble Folk affogato. \nHere are a dozen ways to sip, nosh and revel. Sip, nosh, repeat Advertisement Healdsburg's SHED holds court on North Street, offering up a grange-style mixture of shops, cafes and gathering spaces. You can take a class, perch at the fermentation bar or shop for your favorite olive oil. And the cafe menu ranges from frittatas to pizzettas, roasted pork meatballs and salads that are almost too pretty to eat. \nAt Chalkboard next door, executive chef Shane McAnelly (San Francisco's Zero Zero, Walnut Creek's Va de Vi) has created a sophisticated but relaxed bistro that showcases pristine local ingredients, much of them sourced from Chalk Hill Gardens. \nAnd if your tastes run more in a craft beer and gastropub direction, you'll find Bear Republic Brewing nearby. Pair your Racer 5 IPA with a spicy Rocket Burger or a \"bear necessity\" -- calamari fritto, perhaps, or BRBC wings, dunked in ale-spiked barbecue sauce. \n1.

Bear Republic Brewing, 345 Healdsburg Ave., bearrepublic.com Palmer time New Yorkers may think of Charlie Palmer as \"theirs\" -- the chef, restaurateur and hotelier has eight bistros in Manhattan alone -- but wine country mavens know better. Palmer is a Healdsburg man. You can sample his culinary creations at Dry Creek Kitchen. Browse the eclectic decor and home entertaining offerings at Lime Stone, Charlie and Lisa Palmer's boutique on the ground floor of the Hotel Healdsburg. (We're particularly enamored with the chandeliers constructed entirely of vintage spoons.) \nAnd check out the work of his protégés, who populate the kitchens of some of Healdsburg's most noteworthy restaurants, including Dustin Valette's new, critically acclaimed Valette. \n4.

Valette, 344 Center St., www.valettehealdsburg.com Vino and fries You could try a different tasting room every day for a month and still not exhaust the downtown concentration. But if you have but one Saturday to give to the cause, start at the laid-back Banshee, where the vinyl spins, lounge seating beckons and the pinot noir pours are generous. You may end up staying all day. \nNearby: Ferrari-Carano's Seasons of the Vineyard shop pairs its pours with Scharffen Berger chocolate. And Kendall Jackson's new Partake by KJ is a tasting room by day, restaurant by night -- with red wine-infused fries, yet. \n7. Banshee, 325 Center St., www.bansheewines.com \n8.

It's part of a small, wine country-centric chain, where cookbooks -- such as Charlie Palmer's new \"American Fare\" -- best-sellers and literary tomes coexist happily. Drop in on an author event, browse the stacks and indulge your inner bibliophile. \nThen refuel at what may well be the most brilliant idea ever devised: a pie bar. Piemaster Ozzy Jimenez and his Moustache Baked Goods partner, Christian Sullberg, opened their Noble Folk Ice Cream & Pie Bar last year, pairing strawberry-rhubarb pie with scoops of almond-cardamom, pouring espresso over ice cream, affogato-style, and offering other icy delights. Indulge here, or walk a block to Moustache, where the macarons are seasonal and the cookies sublime. \n10. Copperfield's Books, 104 Matheson St., www.copperfieldsbooks.com \n11.
