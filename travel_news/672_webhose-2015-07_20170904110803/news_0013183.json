Working hard and keeping up with day-to-day tasks is often challenging, fun and rewarding - especially where young children are involved. Sometimes, though, we miss out on spending quality time together, which makes the annual trips away so very important. When it comes to booking a holiday, it's no surprise why exciting family activity holidays are becoming increasingly popular. \nWhat Are Family Activity Holidays? \nActive holidays are mini-adventures for your family and involve fun activities that everyone can get involved in. Some families choose to go walking in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France, while others opt for skiing at Alpe d’Huez, for example. Whatever your choice, with the right operator, you can tailor-make your holiday to suit you and your children. \nThe Benefits \nFamily activity holidays offer a great bonding experience for families. Depending on your choice of experience, you may be pushed out of your comfort zone and need to work as a team to overcome obstacles. You may attempt abseiling, rock climbing or ski touring and, with the right encouragement for each other’s strengths, hopefully you'll have great fun as well! \nMembers of the family will certainly gain in confidence and there's nothing better for health than fresh air and exercise. Trying new things allows children to become more confident, and watching parents take part will encourage them to test their own limits. \nOften, your holiday can be tailor-made into a trip that suits everyone's skills. For example, your group may consist of your five-year old daughter who wants to go wild on a zip wire and your fifteen-year old son who wants to try a tandem skydive. You can make both wishes come true with some careful planning and the right operator. \nFamily activity holidays serve to create real and lasting memories for you and your children. You'll come home with photographic evidence of their proud face when they’ve white-water rafted down a river or holding their arms in the air after skiing down a challenging slope. Apart from the camera, of course, you can leave the electronics at home though as there'll be plenty of other outdoor distractions. In some of the most beautiful locations in the world you could be watching the sun go down in a log cabin and chilling with a glass of wine, while the children sip hot chocolate around the fire -mobile phone, laptop and Mp3 free. \nNo matter what happens on your holiday, you can be guaranteed of plenty of laughs to share, stories to tell and the next adventure to plan.   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted family activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada.
