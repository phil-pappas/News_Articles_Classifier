Photographer's Note \nArab Memorial is a tourist spot in honor of Arab culture in the center of Curitiba. Is located in Gibran Khalil Gibran Square, near the Public Garden, the State College of Parana and Shopping Mueller. It has a cube shape with an area of approximately 140 m² and created in Moorish style having a dome, columns, arches and stained glass widnows. Around it a water mirror pool with fountains. The Memorial houses a café, a library with a capacity of 10,000 volumes and an art gallery, both with works by Arab authors. Badly it was closed when we visit the city. Here the Memorial entrance with pretty columns and arches. In the workshop you can see details of the stain glass windows we see here. \nbesnard has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T11:57:53.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
