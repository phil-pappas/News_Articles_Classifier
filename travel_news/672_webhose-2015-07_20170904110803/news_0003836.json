Barclaycard, which is part of Barclays Retail and Business Banking , believes its cashless payment system is part of the \"sweeping change in the way payments are made.\" But are consumers and experts as impressed? \nOne of the series of high-tech payment devices is a wristband, which cost £24.99 (about $39.00) and is now available for shoppers to buy. Equipped with a chip that connects to an app, with the band securely around their wrist, consumers merely have to wave the gadget at a contactless payment pad instead of fumbling in their wallet for cash or cards. Intent on being a pioneer of contactless payment innovation, Barclaycard released a similar key fob that costs £19.99 ($31.20) and a £14.99 ($23.40) sticker, both of which are also flapped in front of a payment pad in exchange for consumer goods. \nBarclaycard’s smart sticker can be placed on any device, such as a watch, tablet or smartphone, which can then be used as a contactless payment gadget. The high-tech gadgets are known as the bPay system. It was designed primarily so that athletes, drivers and cyclists could pay for items with ease instead of having to carry bulky cash with them. \nbPay was piloted in 2014 at two festivals, as a means of cutting the queues to pay for goods and speeding up payment time. It was also designed to enable children to buy goods without having to carry money with them, giving youngsters more financial independence. Parents are able to top up their bPay gadgets via an app that works with Barclaycard, MasterCard and Visa credit and debit cards. \nIf the devices are stolen or lost, the chip can be cancelled by the customer simply by placing a phone call to the bank. \nWhat started as a trial at a couple of festivals has now been picked up by 300,000 stores in the UK, which are now accepting the wristbands, stickers and key fobs as payment. However, there is a spend limit in place. Consumers can only use the \"wave and pay\" gadgets to pay for goods for £20 ($31.22) or less. Though this will increase to £30 ($46.83) in September, Barclaycard says. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:44:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
