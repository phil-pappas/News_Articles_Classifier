Make transportation luxurious Jul 3, 2015, 6:00am EDT Steve George says his drivers treat customers like family. George’s Limousine service has been driving for more than 30 years. Subscribe now to Photographer: Jim Courtney Steve George says his drivers treat customers like family. Credit a birthday for giving birth to one of the region’s oldest and largest limo services. Steve George , owner of The Limousine Service, said a celebration for his now-late father, John, led to the formation of his company. It was October 1983 when George took his father out for a birthday dinner. As the night wore on and they had some drinks, they decided to call for a limo to drive them for the rest of the night. Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day “We thought that was really great,” George said. “We didn’t have to worry about driving.” The next time they decided to rent a limo, they found out there were none to be had in the area that night. That got them thinking. Besides running a used-car business, the father and son decided to enter the limo world. They traveled to New York City and spent $120,000 on four custom-designed vehicles. “At the time, there just four limo services in Buffalo,” George said. Fast-forward 32 years and now there are more than 30, although the local industry is dominated by a handful, including The Limousine Service. The company has a fleet of 20 vehicles including Lincoln Town cars, Navigators and an Excalibur. Some of the cars can cost as much as $90,000. “One car costs almost as much as our initial investment,” George said. The largest vehicle in the fleet is a specially designed Cadillac Escalade that can seat up to 16 and comes loaded with options such as a bar, TV and Wi-Fi. “That is big with brides,” George said. These days, his company has a staff of 25 including six full-time drivers, a detailer and mechanic. George wants his drivers to be just that — drivers. And he said all of the full-timers have been with the company for at least 10 years. The Limousine Service’s growth makes for a small-business case study of how a company that emphasizes customer service as its main selling point can thrive in a competitive market. “It is a sense of pride that we’ve grown, and so much of it came from word-of-mouth,” George said. His drivers are well-versed in the Western New York scene, including restaurants and tourist destinations. Smoking and drinking are not allowed. “In this business, you have to be a good people person,” he said. “That means being sharp and being on the top of your game.” Limo clients go well beyond wedding parties and prom night specials. George said a large portion of his business is generated by corporate bookings. On any given weekday, he may have six or more cars out on the road beginning at 5 a.m. and staying out until 9 p.m. or later. “Many weeks we are busier Monday through Friday than we are on weekends,” he said. His limos often can be found picking up clients at Buffalo Niagara International Airport, Niagara Falls International Airport, Prior Aviation and Executive Airshare. Indeed, corporate work remains his bread-and-butter, although he said he also does business with visiting rock stars and professional athletes. Citing confidentality clauses, George declined to identify big-name clients, saying, “People respect our discretion.” Some clients ask for specific drivers and vehicles, which George considers the ultimate compliment to his crew and the service they provide. “My motto is to make sure that every client is treated like they are a loved family member,” he said. “My drivers treat our clients like they are driving their own mothers and fathers.” \nWant Buffalo Travel  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:30:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
