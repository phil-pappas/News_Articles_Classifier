At least, I would be if I were still married. But thank goodness I am not. For although Neville, my ex and I have remained good friends, even best friends, since our divorce nearly 30 years ago, I dread to think what life would be like for each of us if we were still wedlocked to each other. Since divorcing nearly 30 years ago Liz and Neville are good friends (John Lawrence) That is, of course, always assuming one of us hadn’t bludgeoned the other to death by now. Just think, I might have served the life sentence of marriage only to be followed by a life sentence for murder. But as it is, amicably separated for decades, we have what I believe is the best sort of later-life relationship; chatty and companionable yet not eternally tied together. • I knew I was marrying the wrong person When my ex comes to my house I welcome him as a guest and it’s the same when I go to see him. We spend a few enjoyable hours in each other’s company and then go our separate ways without rancour or ill-feeling. Although I did not remotely foresee divorce when we had our low-key wedding at the St Neots Registry Office in August 1965, I now believe we work better as friends than spouses. We were both 21 when we married, which seems ridiculously young to today’s generation but there did not appear to be any reason to wait. We had just graduated and although we had not a single penny between us, we had great hopes for our futures. My wedding outfit was made for me by local couturiers D'Arcy and Rosamunde, of Bedford. They specialised in bringing London couture to the provinces. The outfit cost £30 - around £540 today. Meanwhile, my new husband had to get married in the school suit he wore in sixth form. • Why do people still get married young? Together we can make it, we felt. And we did. We embarked on a family, exciting Fleet Street careers and spent many productive hours renovating old houses. Our marriage was fun, stimulating and equal for many years. But gradually, almost imperceptibly, we began to get on each other’s nerves and worse, started to want different things out of life. My husband had become interested in spirituality and was spending a lot of time meditating and going to India. The increasingly austere lifestyle he embraced did not suit me at all and by the end, we were not doing anything together. We had long moved into separate bedrooms and eventually were living in different parts of the same house. By now, it wasn’t so much a marriage as flatmates living under the same roof, and what was worse, flatmates who no longer got on. The only way we were engaging with each other was in in ferocious, bloody arguments. Eventually, there was nothing for it but to part and go our separate ways. We had been married for over 20 years by then and the boys had grown up, so had given it a good shot. • How I lost £165,000 in inheritance tax But although we untied the marital knot, there seemed no reason not to stay friends, especially as there was no reason to argue any more. I think it was a relief to both of us when we finally made the decision to separate; it certainly was for me. We were still only in our early forties, so there was plenty of life left for both of us as single operators. Divorce is usually billed as a sad failure but I don’t see ours that way; we had enjoyed much of married life, but were no longer doing so. We could not pull together as a couple but could be good friends if we lived apart. And I am far from being the only person who has enjoyed a far better relationship with their former spouse after divorce. My late partner John Sandilands continued to have a close and affectionate friendship with his ex wife Jo after they separated. In fact, Jo and I were joint executors of John’s will. He would often go to her place for lunch or tea, and they exchanged presents at Christmas and birthdays right to the end. There was never any question, though, of them getting back together. Susanna Reid had three children with Dominic Cotton (Rex) Some couples do get back together after divorce, or maybe they never really separate. TV personality Susanna Reid has separated from Dominic Cotton, her partner of the past 16 years and father of her three children but they continue to live in the same house . She maintains that they remain excellent friends, but are no longer an item. • The secret to a happy marriage – getting divorced Novelist Simi Bedford and her ex-husband, artist Martin Bedford did move back together many years after their divorce. They did not renew intimacy, but lived and worked side by side in the same house in Devon. Another friend moved almost next door to her ex-husband 20 years after separating, and looked after him until he died. Once all passion is spent, all arguments at an end, it may not be such a bad idea to get back together in your twilight years. After all you probably know each other better than anybody else and so long as you work out a modus operandi that suits you both, why not? Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor (REX) Ruth Rendell, it will be remembered, remarried her ex-husband after their divorce and as far as one knows, lived happily together again. The most famous example of remarriage is probably that of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, but in their case the second marriage was significantly shorter than the first. As for us, there is no question of remarriage. The marriage ended long ago and a calm and mutually rewarding friendship, which to my mind is far better, has taken its place. We are even going to India together later this year, although it is a work trip for both of us rather than a holiday, and Neville has formally asked me out to dinner to celebrate our \"virtual\" Golden Wedding. And yes, I have accepted. So what are the secrets of a happy separation? • How to have a 'nice' divorce The first thing I believe is not to have a bitter divorce. When one partner is greedy or vindictive, the hurts are never healed. My ex and I managed to have an extremely amicable divorce whereby we split the assets 50/50 and that was an end to it. No maintenance, no alimony, no continuing resentment. I know exes who are still paying out to their former partners 30 years later. The bitterer the divorce, the less chance there is that former spouses can remain friends. I know one couple who have not spoken to each other since their divorce, 40 years ago, went right up to the Court of Appeal. The hate has not only lingered but festered and grown stronger over the years. Where a divorce is hotly contested, there is little chance of any future relationship being possible. Then there is the money question. The more financially equal the partners, the greater the chance of parting amicably. The worst divorces happen when where one partner is rich and the other has nothing. • Why quickie divorces are a good idea In our case, as with John and Jo Sandilands, Neville and I were equal earners and could each keep ourselves without a handout from the other. This, I feel, is a major factor in remaining friends. Then, at least in our situation, there was nobody else involved, no third party, no affairs on the side. Where one partner has fallen in love with somebody else and the other feels betrayed, it can be hard to forgive. But you never know when you might need a friend and surely it makes sense to turn to somebody you once loved enough to marry?
