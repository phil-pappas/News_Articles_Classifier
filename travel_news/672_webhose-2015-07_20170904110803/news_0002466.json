The first such initiative by the local authorities, the event was attended by 40 participants from China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia and the Middle East. \n\nZian Ameen, general manager of Aitken Spence Exhibitions and Conventions and president of Sri Lanka Professional Conference, Exhibition and Events Organisers, said the event’s programme, which included a tour of various sites, helped raised the destination’s visibility. \n\n\"We want to target more incentive groups from China,” said Ameen, adding that the MICE travel mart will be held again next year and there are plans to make it an annual affair, with each edition involving a new pool of buyers. \n\nVipula Wanigasekera, CEO of state-run Sri Lanka Convention Bureau (SLCB) said the MICE industry has experienced a leap forward in the last few years with over 144,000 MICE visitors to the country in 2014, many from the incentive travel segment. \n\nSLCB is due to release its first comprehensive MICE data and analysis on July 20, which Wanigasekera said will provide an understanding of the MICE market and its spending patterns. \n\nMeanwhile, Sri Lanka is pitching to host the annual general meeting of the French Travel Agents Association SNAV in 2016. The group is 600-strong and normally holds its meetings outside France. \n\n“We have made a bid and are confident that SNAV will respond positively,” said Wanigasekera. \n\nA high-powered team led by tourism minister Navin Dissanayake will attend the IFTM International French travel show on September 29 to further promote the bid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T09:36:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
