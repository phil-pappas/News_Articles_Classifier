Its main task is to get people from Point A to Point B, cheaply and with no extras (except for semifunctioning Wi-Fi). But with a few adjustments and concessions, it can work. Most important, use the long layovers to your advantage. My plan was to go from New York to Silver Spring, Md. (via Peter Pan, not Megabus, which does not stop in Silver Spring), and crash my nephews’ swim practice with a takeout Vietnamese dinner. A few hours later, I’d catch the Metro to Union Station in Washington for Megabus’s overnight bus to Knoxville, Tenn., known for its music, spending a day and evening there. Then I’d catch a 1:30 a.m. bus to Lexington, Ky., arriving at 5 a.m., to start a four-day bike trip . The way back worked out with shorter stops and just one overnight. Sound torturous? Perhaps. I’m not saying it was paradise on wheels. But the total cost, including the Peter Pan leg, was just $63 (and could have been less if I hadn’t had to postpone the trip once and reschedule on short notice). By comparison, round-trip flights from New York to Lexington when I booked were edging toward $400. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The first leg to Silver Spring was a breeze; at $18 it was the most expensive leg, but worth it — dropping me off, by the way, about two minutes from the tasty and affordable Lotus Cafe . Later that evening, after pho and spring rolls and some horsing around in the pool, I hopped on the Metro to Union Station for the bus to Knoxville. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story No one is expecting an overnight bus ride to be pleasant, but in the last five years of writing Frugal Traveler, I have often been surprised by almost decadently luxurious overnight buses, with plush seats that recline fairly close to horizontal. But those were in countries like Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia. In the United States, the same cost-cutting mania that removed the last traces of dignity from coach-class air travel has shorn any semblance of comfort from our buses, as well. (Without such cost cutting, I admit that I wouldn’t be writing this article in the first place.) So I should not have been surprised that my upper-deck seat to Knoxville was barely cushioned and quite tight. Still, the bus was clean, the driver upbeat and friendly considering the task before her, and the bathroom functional. But an unpleasant surprise was in store for anyone who came unprepared. By which I mean me. As we boarded, most passengers broke out pillows and heavy blankets and comforters, as if we were going on an Arctic expedition. I scoffed at their packing inefficiency. My sleeping pill occupied about one one-millionth the space. Then came an odd announcement. “This bus is climate-controlled,” said the driver, suddenly sounding less hospitable, “which means we cannot control the AC or the heat. Send your comments to megabus.com .” It was a pre-emptive strike against passenger mutiny, as the bus was soon frigid. My carry-on backpack offered little help; I had packed for a bike ride in the scorching heat. Bike shorts pulled snug over your head like a ski mask, it turns out, do not conserve much warmth. (A Megabus spokesman confirmed that the bus driver does not control the temperature and said that the buses are set to the same temperature as “most federal buildings.”) I did get one welcome break from a sleepless, shivering night — a 3:45 a.m. stop at Love’s Travel Stop , somewhere in western Virginia. If you’ve been to Love’s, you know what awaited me: every possibly temptation for anyone with a sweet tooth or a penchant for late-night grease. (Count me in for both.) A woman from the bus spotted me eyeing the two-for-$3 Tornados , greasy meats and cheeses rolled up in crispy crusts (or in blueberry pancakes!), rotating on rollers like 7-Eleven hot dogs under a heat lamp. Embarrassed I had been spotted considering such a purchase, I slipped away. A few minutes later, after admiring the CB radios and pocketknives and an impressive jerky selection, I went back and grabbed the plastic tongs, sliding one pizza Tornado and one blueberry-pancake-and-sausage Tornado into the provided sleeves. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T05:01:04.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
