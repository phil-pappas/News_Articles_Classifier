PHOTO: CHRIS HILLOCK \nNational Airways Corporation (NAC) flight 441 had taken off from Whenuapai airport in north-west Auckland at 8.05am that morning. \nThe DC3 - a veteran of World War II - was scheduled to stop at Tauranga, Gisborne, Napier, and Palmerston North, before eventually arriving in Wellington in the early afternoon. \nIt was an era when people dressed up for air travel. \nTheir best clothes would soon be scattered among wreckage. \nAt 9.06am Tauranga air traffic control was in contact as the plane began its descent. \nWorkers at a quarry at Gordon, between Te Aroha and Matamata, heard it pass low overhead. \nThen there was the sound, compared to a door banging shut far away. \nBad weather and rough terrain meant it was almost 48 hours before the plane was found. \nThe impact and fire was so bad that a pathologist was needed to identify the charred, blackened remains ot the 20 passengers and three crew. \nAn investigation into the crash found that while weather in Auckland and Tauranga that day was not too bad there was an easterly gusting to 150kmh between the two. \nIn zero-visibility, with dodgy radio compasses, the pilots were effectively flying blind. \nPilot Len Enchmarch and first officer Peter Kissel likely thought they tracking down the eastern slopes of the Kaimai ranges but they were in fact further west. \nInvestigators came to the conclusion the plane was descending and turning for its run into Tauranga but got caught in powerful down draughts and got slammed into the rock face. \nTauranga air traffic control called again at 9.14am - eight minutes after the first call - but there was no reply. There was effectively no plane. \nApart from the 23 dead, the crash would go down in New Zealand aviation history as the first time helicopters were used in a search and recover operation in this country. \nPeople gather in Gordon, beneath the Kaimai Ranges, in 2003 to remember those who died on flight 441 in 1963. PHOTO: STEPHEN BARKER \nAviation historian Richard Waugh, who has written a book on the tragedy, said news of the crash dominated newspaper front pages for about five days. \nNew Zealand's post-war optimism was shattered by \"this great tragedy\" in a normally reliable DC3 being flown by our national carrier. \n\"It really was quite appalling. It just literally hit a rock face.\" \nIn recent years he has clambered to the crash site. \nHe drove most of the way but the last few kilometres were a steep and wintry walk almost 1km above sea level. The final descent was down ropes. \nThe fuselage was gutted in 1963 but the wings were flung free. \nThe bodies have long since been removed but the rugged terrain meant some wreckage remains, some buried in deep undergrowth, to this day. \nFor 15 years it was New Zealand's worst air disaster. \nThat record was shattered when Air New Zealand flight TE901 slammed into the side of Antarctica's Mt Erebus, leaving a smudge in the snow and 257 dead. \nThat day, November 28, 1979, flight 441 became our worst ever air disaster on domestic soil, Waugh said. \n\"Hopefully that will be the case for a long, long, long time.\" \nNew Zealand's Worst Air Disasters \nNov 28, 1979 - Air New Zealand DC10 crashes on Mt Erebus in Antarctica, killing all 257 passengers and crew. \nJuly 3, 1963 - NAC DC3 crashes in the Kaimai Ranges, 23 dead. \nMar 18, 1949 - NAC Lodestar crashes on approach to Paraparaumu, 15 dead. \n1942 - Liberator bomber crashes near Whenuapai, 14 dead. \nAug 21, 1944 - Two Lockheed Hudson bombers disappear, 14 dead. \nOct 23, 1948 - NAC Lockheed Electra crashes on Mt Ruapehu, killing 13. \nJan 7, 2012 - 11 die when a hot air balloon plunges to the ground in flames near Carterton.
