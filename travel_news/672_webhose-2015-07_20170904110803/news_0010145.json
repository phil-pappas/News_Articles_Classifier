On Monday, The Associated Press revealed Cosby admitted in 2005 to obtaining quaaludes with the intent of giving them to women with whom he wanted to have sex.\nOn Tuesday, the museum issued a statement saying it is \"aware of the recent revelations about Bill Cosby's behavior.\" The museum went on to say that it \"in no way condones this behavior.\"\nBut the museum says the exhibition is fundamentally about the artworks and the artists who created them, not about the owners of the collections.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T09:05:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
