This came in spite of a 4% rise in turnover to £188.6m. \nAccounts released recently at Companies House cover winter 2013-14 as well as the following summer up to October 31, 2014. \nThe company said that sales for ski holidays had been hit by “the late arrival of snow” in European resorts, plus storms and floods in the UK, which “disrupted the selling environment still further”. \nHotelplan also pointed the finger at the government for legislation that removed the “discretion of head teachers over permitting holidays during the term time”. \nThe late Easter also compounded “an already difficult season”. \nSummer 2014 also proved difficult with “overcapacity in the wider market and especially the ever-increasing growth in heavily discounted cruising holidays” causing the problems, according to Hotelplan. \nHotelplan’s bad year was made worse by a £0.8m provision for historic overseas taxes. \n“Despite growing passenger volumes and average selling prices, the challenging trading conditions saw margins come under pressure…” the company said in its strategic report. \nSubsidiary Inntravel, which bills itself as a “slow holidays” specialist, enjoyed a better year. \nTurnover rose by 5% to £15.5m, helping boost operating profit by 14% to £1.8m. \n“The company delivered a successful financial year with all of the core programme achieving turnover growth, and the company saw a substantial increase in bookings received from customers based overseas (especially the US and Australia),” the company said. \nInghams, Inntravel and the rest of the UK brands are ultimately owned by Swiss retail cooperative Migros. \nInntravel was bought by Hotelplan UK from Amber Travel in 2008 while the Enigma Travel Group, comprising Esprit Ski, Esprit Sun, Ski Total and Santa’s Lapland, was purchased in 2010. \nTurnover at the ultimate UK parent company Hotelplan (UK Group) Ltd rose 4% to £204.5m but the firm slipped to a pre-tax loss of £591,000 due to a £739,000 foreign exchange loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
