He says the moonlit night scenes, taken in the North Korea countryside, are the most special to him.\n\"I live in Singapore where many parts of the year we get haze from neighboring forest fires and permanent light pollution at night,\" says Pan. \"A city dweller like me finds the North Korean countryside and mountains particularly spectacular.\"\nPan's project allows him to go beyond Pyongyang to less traveled areas, from the country's highest mountain Mt. Paektu -- where Kim Jong-un recently trekked -- to a local market in Rason, a special economic zone.\nMORE: New train tour set to reveal North Korea's unseen corners\nInside North Korea's local market\n\"The most memorable day was the time spent in Rason,\" says Pan.\n\"I was allowed to visit the harbor port, factories and the local market.\"\nThe open air market is about the size of a football field with rows of stalls covered with corrugated metal roofs for shade.\nUnfortunately, no cameras were allowed inside.\n\"The place is packed shoulder to shoulder with locals,\" says Pan.\n\"All manner of products are sold here, from meat and vegetables, to mascara and BB face cream. There are even automobile spare parts.\"\nBut one discovery was particularly surprising for the Singaporean.\n\"North Korean women do wear very colorful, fancy and sexy underwear. Knowledge that would otherwise elude me.\"\nBut his favorite story from his North Korea trips relates to a tour leader.\n\"For my last trip, the tour leader was an Australian who is 2.06 meters tall,\" says Pan.\n\"He's considered a giant in North Korea and all the locals were incredibly curious about him. If the locals came up and chatted with us, he would also grab them and spin them around -- guys only, of course.\n\"That really breaks the ice.\"\nHis DPRK360 project\nPan's DPRK360 project was independently initiated but since gaining a bigger following, travel companies -- Universal Travel Corporation (Singapore), DPR Korea Travel (Malaysia), Juche Travel Services (UK) and Young Pioneer Tours (China) -- have been willing to cover some of the costs of his trips.\nHe says people can support him by buying him a trip from one of those travel companies or by sponsoring equipment he can use on his journeys.\nHis website has ignited debate among those who try to decipher his photos but Pan stresses that his project has nothing to do with politics.\n\"There are those who are extreme supporters of communism and socialism who want to use of my images as ammunition to attack capitalism, then there are those that seek to find proof of the failure of the North Korean government through my images,\" says Pan.\n\"Both extreme ends of the spectrum are always a source of irritation for me.\"\nHis next trip to North Korea is in October but he says he has a bigger plan for the country.\n\"The other more audacious dream I have would be to open a cafe/training school in Pyongyang with an international theme,\" says Pan.\n\"That gives me the chance to stay in there longer with a business visa and reach out to train the locals with various skills.\"", "external_links": ["https://round.me/embed/2641/7973", "https://www.facebook.com/dprk360", "https://round.me/embed/5304/14462", "http://www.dprk360.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Xim9GEbchw"], "published": "2015-07-23T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T06:00:21.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
