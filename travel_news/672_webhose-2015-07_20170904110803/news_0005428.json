Apple Leisure Group, which includes the largest Mexico-bound wholesaler Apple Vacations and sister company Travel Impressions, said the decision is a direct result of Donald Trump’s comments about Mexican immigration during his presidential campaign announcement speech. The group said that it is also exploring alternative venue options for its annual Golden Apple Gala, which had been scheduled to take place at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. \n“While we respect individuals’ right to free speech, we cannot condone or support Mr. Trump’s portrayal of Mexicans, who are a vibrant, hard-working people,” said Alex Zozaya, CEO of Apple Leisure Group. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T23:21:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
