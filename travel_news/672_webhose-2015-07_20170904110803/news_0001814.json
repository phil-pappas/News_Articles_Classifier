In summer, it’s given over to celebrity-haunted festivals and supermodels strutting along the promenades in oversized sunglasses. In winter, it’s an entirely different proposition. The likes of Cannes, St Tropez and Antibes are the places to be seen from May to September, but in the low season the crowds dissipate and the prices come down, too. Tucked between the ultra-chic resorts are charming small seaside towns where you’ll find even better value, as well as more than 300 days of sunshine per year and mild winter temperatures due to a Mediterranean micro-climate. Brittany Ferries has the widest choice of cross-Channel ferry crossings, with sailings from Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth With regular Brittany Ferries services to France from the south of England, the French Riviera is within easy striking distance for a long and leisurely winter break. An ideal place to indulge in the French lifestyle is Le Rayol, less than 20 miles from St Tropez. With its neighbour Le Canadel, it forms a twin village known as Le Rayol-Canadel sur Mer. The “mer” here is backed by a picturesque coastline dotted with sandy coves and rocky headlands, where the luxuriant foliage runs down to the water’s edge. In winter, Le Rayol is a sleepy place so ideal for a relaxing holiday, though there are shops and small bars and restaurants, including Maurin des Maures, which serves up treats such as stuffed squid and Provençal veal chops. Naturally, the wine served and available for purchase locally would alone be a good reason to visit this area. French fancy: with boutique shops and local markets there's culture around every corner Photo: Getty Come between mid-January and March and you’ll witness a wonderful display of yellow mimosas. The town is on the Route des Mimosas and even if you don’t join in the classic procession linking the “mimosa villages” along the coast, you’ll see them around town and in the beautiful Domaine du Rayol botanical gardens. In fact, the whole village is considered a garden, with more than 400 species of plants. A short drive away, the Maures mountains are a magnet for walkers who can stride out among the heathers and eucalyptus trees. There are pretty strolls along and above the lovely coast, too; the long-distance GR51 path, the Balcony of the Côte d’Azur, runs close to the village. With your own car, a slow drive is a must to see some of the other villages that make up this gorgeous stretch of coast. But you’re sure to want to visit St Tropez, too. The town is an eclectic mix of designer boutiques and traditional stores lining narrow old streets and, although the marina may be devoid of superyachts in winter, it’s an appealing place to wander. Above the town, the 16th-century citadel offers great views, and there is a splendid and surprisingly wild way-marked walk around the peninsula. Brittany Ferries offers The Résidence le Bailli de Suffren at Le Rayol . These stylish apartments sleep two people, and have a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the glittering Mediterranean or the gardens. There is also easy access to two beaches, a Turkish Bath, free Wi-Fi and roadside parking. The price from just £799pp for a four-week stay at The Résidence, including your Brittany Ferries sailing to France and back, is a bargain for such a glorious setting on the French Riviera. Brittany Ferries has the widest choice of cross-Channel ferry crossings, with sailings from Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth to the five French ports of Le Havre, Caen, Cherbourg, St Malo and Roscoff – the perfect jumping-off points for a road trip down through France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:17:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
