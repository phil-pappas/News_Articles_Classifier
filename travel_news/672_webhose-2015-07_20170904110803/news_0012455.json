Stock car stadia apart, last weekend Battersea Park became the first Greater London venue to host a motor race since the Crystal Palace circuit closed in September 1972. The first London ePrix – the final round of the FIA Formula E Championship for all-electric single-seaters – didn’t run wholly smoothly, but provided an appropriately dramatic finale to a series that began in Beijing and traversed four continents before winding down in the shadow of the decommissioned, defiantly non-electric Battersea Power Station. In pole was the Swiss Sébastien Buemi, backed by the world champion Alain Prost It was a given that the circuit would be tight, but it was also conspicuously bumpy – so much so that the layout had to be changed following Saturday’s opening practice session to prevent potential suspension breakages. Which meant that the first of two races took place with part of the opening sequence of corners blanked off to prevent drivers taking the most direct – and most destructive – route. Overnight resurfacing work smoothed both the surface and the organiser’s fears, allowing race two to take place on the route originally envisaged. Driving for the e.dams team, co-owned by four-times world champion Alain Prost, Swiss racer Sébastien Buemi came into the weekend as title outsider… but on Saturday a dominant victory from pole position put him firmly back in contention. Buemi’s prospects looked more positive still after Sunday’s rain-affected qualifying session, when contracted tyre supplier Michelin’s all-weather tyre – suitable for wet or dry conditions – was tested for the first time during a race weekend. It was raining when Buemi ventured out, but not as heavily as it was for Brazilian title rivals Lucas di Grassi and Nelson Piquet. He started sixth while di Grassi and Piquet were 11th and 16th respectively. The critical moment came just after Sunday’s mid-race pit stop, when Buemi spun and ceded one position to Bruno Senna. At that stage he was still in the driving seat, but Piquet was gently making progress – and, by moving up to eighth, he had provisionally done enough to move one point clear of Buemi in the final standings. The Briton, Sam Bird wins at Battersea and Nelson Piquet took the championship Try as he might, Buemi was unable to repass Senna to redress the balance and he crossed the line in sixth place. That became fifth when on-the-road winner Stéphane Sarrazin was penalised for exceeding the maximum permitted energy allocation, enabling Briton Sam Bird to take his second victory of the season. Piquet was similarly promoted and the title was his by 144 points to 143. “I have to accept it,” Buemi said. “I made a mistake and it cost me a place that was crucial. Congratulations to Nelson, but we’ll be back next season.” Take the performance driving quiz » You may also be interested in: • What is Formula E? » • In preview: the Goodwood Festival of Speed » • Video: highlights from Le Mans 2015 »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:18:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
