We’re determined to show our support for this timeless, classic nation.” \nMeanwhile Aldemar Resorts vice president Alexandros Angelopoulos added: “Greece has been in the headlines for a great length of time, many might say for all the wrong reasons. One could also add that there have been a collection of assumptions and misconceptions. \n“As an independent hotel resort group, we can add that the importance of tourism for Greece has never waned during these difficult times. \n“The resilience and commitment by our trade partners in the UK and elsewhere has shown that Greece as a holiday destination is respected and loved for all the right reasons. \n“There are no misconceptions here, we still remain the country where our sun, sea and people come together in harmony and have done so for centuries, to provide visitors to our beautiful shores with timeless Greek Filoxenia. \n“We are also a holiday destination that continues to be attractive in pricing terms too. \n“It is a European country with an incomparable cultural, gastronomical and sentimental wealth, which enables us to say emphatically that we are here for the long haul and look forward to welcoming many more visitors until the end of October 2015, and for many more fruitful decades to come.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:12:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
