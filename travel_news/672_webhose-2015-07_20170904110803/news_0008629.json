Herrera is especially critical of travel conditions from New York to Atlanta for Wednesday’s semi-final game at the Georgia Dome against Panama. According to Reuters, Coach Miguel Herrera told reporters: Mexico is the team that fills the stadiums and we are not being treated well... We should be getting more consideration. We had to wait three hours, then they packed two teams (into the plane) and CONCACAF people, I don't know why. We were all squashed. Our luggage had to go by land because of too much weight on the plane... They say we're carrying too much but we're the ones who put most fans in the stadiums. During the flight, the players were squeezed in and that can't be. We played extra time and the players shouldn't have to wait so long (at the airport) and travel in those conditions.\" In May, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) announced an agreement with CONCACAF that designates Delta as the Official Airline of the 2015 Gold Cup, throughout CONCACAF territory including the United States and Canada, as well as Mexico, Central America and the rest of Latin America. \nWant Atlanta Logistics & Transportation news in your inbox?
