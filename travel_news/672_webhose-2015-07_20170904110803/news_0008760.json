The Canberran wins a race with every 4.4 starters he saddles up.\nSheezsingle has won her past two starts at Canberra by a combined margin of 3-3/4 lengths when competing in class 2 and benchmark 60 events.\nHer authoritative win prompted Dale to suggest “she’s ready to tackle better horses now” and that’s why the daughter of Not A Single Doubt lines up in Monday’s Canberra Tradies Clubs Benchmark 65 Handicap (1010m).\n“I really feel that (jockey) Jay Ford has the key to this mare. He’s worked her out and she’s definitely more comfortable with him on top,” Dale said.\n“Her two recent wins have been very strong and she hasn’t put a foot wrong since her last start.”\nSheezsingle is quite adept in wet ground with only one unplaced effort in seven starts on wet tracks. Dale knows the track will most likely be firmer than what Sheezsingle has been competing on of late.\n“They’re saying a soft (5) and that’s a bit drier than what she’s seen lately but I think she’ll be well suited.”\nDale also has Circle Game set for her first start in the Martelletto@RushPark 2YO Handicap and the trainer reckons we could see a handy debut.\n“She’s a nice horse that will run well and done well in the lead up to this,” he said.\n“But I do think she’s a horse that will come into her own when we get her out over more ground.\n“It’s a pretty handy two-year-old race for a Monday at Moruya, there’s horse from some of the best stables in the area and some of the horses look to have ability.\n“The good thing is we know if she runs a good race and can get close to them then she’ll be very hard to beat in a similar race over further.”\nDale trails disqualified trainer Luke Griffith by three wins in the march for the title of champion country trainer in NSW.\n“We’ve got a few going around this week and kicks off here at Moruya,” he said.\nDale has runners at Wagga on Tuesday, Canterbury on Wednesday and will look to wrap up the season at his home track Canberra on Friday, where he reckons the premiership race could be decided.\nOriginally published as Sheezsingle can edge Dale closer to premiership", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/superracing/sheezsingle-is-an-ace-in-matthew-dales-premiership-hand/story-fni2gg7e-1227457827391"], "published": "2015-07-27T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:29:17.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
