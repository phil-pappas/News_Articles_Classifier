You’re still not exciting and fun to watch. I am the new blood in the division, you are an old man.”\n2. “You look old even though I think you’ve had Botox. Jab-and-grab won’t be enough against me.”\n3. “It’s a personal mission for me to rid boxing of a boring person like you. I’m interested in all of them belts you’ve got on there. I’m interested in breaking your face in. You’re boring, I want to rid you out of the heavyweight division.\n4. “You’re a wrinkled old man with a glass chin and I am going to make that glass explode like a bottle hitting a wall.”\n5. “I just want to smash your old face and I don’t give a f*** what anybody thinks because I don’t give a f*** about being a role model.”\n6. “Your jab-and-grab style — surely all of Europe wants to see you get beaten and all of Europe and the rest of the world will see you get beaten.\n7. “Are you greater than Louis, Ali, Frazier, Holmes? I think not. You’ve just fought bums well selected for you by your management.”\n8. “When I look at you I’m not feared. I don’t even see a big man because you’re not only shorter than me but you’re light for a modern heavyweight.”\n9. “When I went to your training camp once I saw just your tired old jab-and-grab routine. I came away full of confidence.”\n10. “You’re nothing. History tells that when even great heavyweights get to your age (39) they go into rapid decline. It also says that old men give way to young lions like me (Fury is 26).\n11. “You’re getting knocked out and then I may come and live in Germany and take over your new TV contract.”\nAnd the most offensive line of all ...\n12. “This Klit is getting licked on October 24.”\nKlitschko was more than happy for Fury to carry the show, occasionally offering a few responses in German which drew laughs from the audience.\n“Good. Now he’s being entertaining. That means the fight will be exciting. This is business,” Klitschko added.\n“I believe Tyson Fury is really meaning what he is talking about and he is definitely not coming here on October 24 just to be present and be on the canvas. No, he came here to win the championship fight.\n“This guy is so entertaining. He sings, he dances, he is a cool dude. He does different things that people like — or hate. Some people adore you, some people say they can’t stand you, which is good.”\nDespite Fury’s 24-0 record, Klitschko (64-3) will likely enter the fight a heavy favourite.\nAntonio Tarver, who is embarking on his own campaign in the heavyweight division, gives Fury no chance.\n“I personally don’t think that Tyson Fury has the ability to beat a guy like Klitschko,” Tarver told boxingscene.com.\n“As soon as Klitschko hits him on the chin with that right hand, he’s gone. He’s out of there. I don’t think he has the skills, the talent. He’s just a big, massive man and that’s it. I don’t see nothing in Tyson Fury, that’s just my take.”\nOriginally published as Astonishing attack on boxing champ", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-unleashes-astonishing-verbal-attack-on-wladimir-klitschko/story-fndkzthy-1227452022134", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/22/1227452/020316-9d20bc52-2ffe-11e5-bb9a-f3bb36310c03.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8by5ehVRrfk"], "published": "2015-07-22T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:46:52.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
