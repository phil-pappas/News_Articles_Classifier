The signatures must still be validated.\nIf the initiative moves forward and is approved by voters, it would remove final approval for any tax increment financing project under $2.5 million from the city's Urban Renewal Authority and give it to City Council.\nIt would require a city-wide vote on any TIF financing package over $2.5 million.\nThe measure is retroactive to March 1, 2015, meaning that if the signature count holds up — only 1,000 are required — and voters approve the measure in November, the $6.2 million TIF package just awarded to the developer of a Walmart-anchored site at 38th Avenue and Wadsworth Boulevard would be put to a public vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:37:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
