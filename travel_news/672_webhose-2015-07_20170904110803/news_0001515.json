A limited number of booth spaces are available for Fairhaven non-profit groups, artists, crafters and Fairhaven businesses that wish to offer items for sale, children’s games or fall-themed activities, food, etc. This could be used as a fundraising opportunity for groups and it can provide a venue for those looking for a fun community event in which to participate. The event will be held from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\nThe Office of Tourism will offer spaces to Fairhaven-based non-profit groups, individual artists and crafters, and businesses on a first come first served basis. The space will be approximately eleven feet square to allow groups to set up 10’x10’ pop-up canopies if desired. (Special arrangements for larger areas may be made on a case by case basis as room allows.) A limited number of spots can have access to electricity. Harvest Fun Day will be marketed primarily as a Family/Children’s event with a fall theme. Potential vendors should keep that in mind when deciding on whether or not they wish to participate. Free or low-cost children’s activities are particularly encouraged, as are locally produced goods or Fairhaven-themed items. Vendors from outside of Fairhaven may be accepted as space allows.\nVendors this year will be asked to make a donation of $10 to the Office of Tourism Gift Account. This money goes toward the rental of handicap accessible portable toilets. (Town of Fairhaven government entities –senior center, Fairhaven Public Schools groups, etc.–are exempt from the donation.)\nIf you, your group or business are interested in applying for a booth space, please email [email protected] anytime with details of what you would like to do. Be sure to include a contact name and phone number. Or you may call the Office of Tourism at 508-979-4085. Participants will be selected by the Office of Tourism based on how suited the booths, products and/or activities are to the overall “Harvest Fun Day” theme.\nThe final deadline to apply for a space will be Friday, September 4, but acceptances may be confirmed before then and space is limited, so please apply early.\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Utah lost $33 million in tourism due to shutdown UK-based tour operator offers weekend trip to other side of planet Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards PROMPERÚ to tap Indian travel market", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:31:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
