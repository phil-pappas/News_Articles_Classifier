Hosted by the prestigious UK-based interior design magazine design et al, this achievement says more than other awards of its ilk. \nInstead of being limited to a judging panel, shortlisted entries are announced online and voting is open to industry professionals, clients and customers as well as design et al readers. This makes for a broader and more thorough judging process, thus a harder win and a more prestigious prize. An impressive feat for a hotel that has only reached its second year! The Royal Palm Marrakech’s particular blend of rustic Berber charm with a contemporary edge is meticulously curated throughout every inch of the 231-hectare estate. Local identity is essential: from the colourful zellij tiles that adorn the Al Ain restaurant to scatterings of traditional Moucharabieh wooden lattice panels, pergolas and use of nearby-sourced materials throughout the complex. Combined with the 2000 metre-squared pool and over 2000 ancient olive trees, fragrant lavender bushes and palms that curve around it, it becomes clear that neither genuine Moroccan intricacies nor 6 star luxury are sacrificed for the other. Jacques Silvant, General Manager at Royal Palm Marrakech comments “We feel incredibly honoured to be recognised as a leading hotel for design; we really strive to provide a respite from the Red City that also incorporates its essence whenever possible, so it is really wonderful to have our efforts rewarded”. Conveniently located just 12 km from the bustling centre of Marrakech and 8 km from the airport, this luxurious six star property offers a serene and tranquil haven to its guests. All 135 lavish suites and villas have been furnished to the highest standard opening onto either a generous balcony or terrace. Suites are set over three floors with breath taking views over the gardens, the magnificent hotel golf course and across to the snow-capped Atlas mountains beyond. For those wanting the ultimate, extravagant Moroccan experience, the Penthouse Suite with its very own private plunge pool will not disappoint. No stay would be complete without pampering at the superb Spa by Clarins, exclusive to the Royal Palm Marrakech, with special areas reserved for women only. Enjoy a traditional Moroccan hammam in one of the 5 single or double hammam, or a range of massages in one of the 8 single or 2 double massage cabins, 2 baleno massage cabins.
