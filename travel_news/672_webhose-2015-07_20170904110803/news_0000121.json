The Google Hotel Ads Commission Program combines the benefits and reach of Google Hotel Ads with the hotels’ existing commission programs by making the hotels’ best available retail rates searchable and bookable on Google.\nWhen travelers search for a hotel on Google Search, Google Maps or Google+, they will be able to select the property and rate they want, and then book the room directly with the hotel without ever leaving the page, reducing the abandonment rate commonly seen when consumers have to switch sites to complete a transaction.\n“Our ability to be the first CRS provider to offer the Google Hotel Ads Commission Program shows the influence of the Sabre brand in the industry as well as our commitment to deliver new and valuable opportunities to our hotel customers,” said Sabre Hospitality Solutions President Alex Alt. “This is just the latest example of how we are continually investing in innovative solutions that deliver unique value to hotels and the travelers they serve.”\nBecause Sabre has already completed the necessary technology integration with Google and Sabre’s SynXis Central Reservation has access to the hotels’ commissionable retail rates, Sabre hotel customers can participate in the program without any investment or development on their part.\n“We are firm believers in technology to drive new strategy in the marketplace and have confidence that we will realize more bookings from this program,” said Morgans Hotel Group Senior Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer Chadi Farhat. “It’s this kind of innovation and thoughtfulness about flexible business solutions that makes Sabre a great partner for our collection of brands.”\nAs compared to Google’s Hotel Ads cost-per-click model, Sabre hotel customers participating in the new commission-based model only pay a commission on confirmed bookings for their property. The program gives hotels another cost-effective option to drive bookings by putting their brands front and center when travelers are ready to book.\nSabre’s award-winning team provides innovative and highly-effective digital marketing services that deliver results to hotels around the world that are designed to maximize the hotels’ return on investment and increase conversion rates. In addition, the company’s broader retailing and merchandising solutions for hotels are powered by the SynXis Enterprise Platform, the industry’s first fully-integrated SaaS-based hospitality solutions portfolio, which is currently deployed at more than 20,000 hotels around the world.\nRelated Posts TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Sabre developing travel services for emerging wearable technology eRevMax offers hoteliers access to advanced rate recommendations within the LIVE platform ZDirect Solutions Stirring Excitement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:06:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
