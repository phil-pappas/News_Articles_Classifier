But at the end of the day, numbers and physical sizes (of the exhibition halls) don’t make a good travel fair.” \n\nTo attract more visitors, there will be new exhibitors, lucky draws, cultural performances and play areas for children.“We hope to create a carnival-like experience for the whole family to come down and enjoy themselves,” added Lek. \n\nNATAS' 13 new exhibitors include Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), which is part of a broader initiative by both organisations to raise traveller’s awareness about travel-related health matters and concerns. \n\nWhen quizzed about the rivalry between NATAS Travel Fair and Travel Revolution and the chances of a reconciliation, Lek emphasised that the exhibitors who did not participate in the last travel fair are still part of NATAS. \n\n“We hope for a reconciliation, yes, but you need two hands to clap,” he said. \n\nLek also highlighted that both travel fairs should not be competing with each other but instead focus on how to combine efforts to encourage travellers who use the Internet to book their travel itineraries to use travel agencies instead. \n\nMeanwhile, NATAS is looking towards social media to tackle the supposed lack of advertising and publicity that caused top outbound travel agencies to jump ship. \n\n“The fact is, we are putting a foothold in social media such as on Facebook and TripAdvisor,” said Lek. \n\nThe NATAS travel fair will be held on July 31 until August 2 at the Singapore Expo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:06:16.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
