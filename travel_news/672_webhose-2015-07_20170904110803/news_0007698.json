Much as I like to travel and work abroad, Copenhagen – or København – is my home town and there are so many things I love about living in the city: the people and pace of life, the abundance of water and green spaces, the museums and architecture, old and new. Anything special I should pack? Shoes for walking. The city has one of the longest pedestrian, car-free streets in Europe, Strøget, which is full of nice shops and has interesting little side streets leading off it. In general, the Danes tend to dress more casually, so bring the clothes you feel most comfortable in, and you will blend in fine. If you go in the summer be sure to bring a swimsuit. The water in the city’s canals is so clean that you can swim in it, and there are lots of good spots to jump in. Gammeltorv Square on Strøget (Alamy) What’s the first thing you do when you arrive? Curse the fact that I have a fourth-floor apartment in a building without a lift. As a result, I struggle to get my suitcase up to my flat. And to make matters worse, I always overpack. Then I kiss my children. After that, I usually have a coffee and say hello to my friends down at a local café, Holberg 19 (0045 3314 0190; Holbergsgade 19), before going for a walk by the harbour. • A weekend break in...Copenhagen Where is the best place to stay? As I live there, I never stay in hotels in Copenhagen. But I have some friends who are very fond of Nyhavn 71 (45 3343 6200; 71nyhavnhotel.com ), which is housed in a heritage warehouse, located in a historic district in the centre of town, and has wonderful views of Copenhagen harbour. Buildings on the Nyhavn waterfront (Alamy) Where would you meet friends for a drink? My favourite place to meet up with friends is the wine bar Ved Stranden 10 (45 3542 4040; vedstranden10.dk ). which is both its name and street address. It has a relaxed atmosphere, and a fine selection of wines. What else could you ask for? • Copenhagen by the owner of Noma, the world's best restaurant Where is the best place for lunch? Copenhagen has loads of really good restaurants and “New Nordic” cuisine is enjoying a golden age. You can also, of course, find the traditional Danish “smørrebrød” (open sandwich) in many places. But for a lovely, more relaxed lunch, I’d suggest taking a water bus from Nyhavn across the harbour to a building called Papirøen (Paper Island) where there is a great food market open from Friday to Sunday. You can sit and enjoy your meal by the waterside – it’s just a brilliant spot. Incidentally, the best place for afternoon tea, especially for fans of the hit Danish television series Borgen, is the restaurant at the top of the “Tower of Borgen” at Christiansborg (45 3392 6492; christiansborg.dk ), the Danish parliament building. You can enjoy tea and cakes there as well as a great view of the city. The traditional Danish “smørrebrød” (Alamy) And for dinner? Sail back across the harbour and go to an old custom house called The Standard (45 7214 8808; thestandardcph.dk ), home to three restaurants and a jazz club. If you want to dine somewhere really special, I would recommend the Almanak restaurant there, which serves the most amazing Nordic food and has a fabulous location overlooking the water. • Copenhagen: the perfect break Where would you send a first time visitor? I would send them out on a bike, which is one of the best ways to experience the city. We have cycling lanes practically everywhere and it’s so easy to get around on them. One of the places you have to go to is the Tivoli Gardens (45 3315 1001; tivoli.dk ), in the very centre of town. It’s like entering a fairy-tale world – and after dark, when all the lights are turned on, it’s magical. Tivoli Gardens (Alamy) What should I avoid? I hope I won’t be exiled for saying this, but I’ve never understood why tourists are taken to see the statue of The Little Mermaid by the water’s edge in Langelinie. It’s sweet but definitely very far down my list of things to see. • Copenhagen: a girl's guide to the best shops, hotels and restaurants Copenhagen harbour (Alamy) What should I bring home? We have plenty of good liquorice – I particularly love liquorice coated in chocolate. It’s delicious, really. And the Royal Copenhagen company makes beautiful porcelain, so do have a look around their store ( royalcopenhagen.com ). Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? Places that are too fancy. Series one of Fortitude, starring Sofie Gråbøl, is out on DVD now.
