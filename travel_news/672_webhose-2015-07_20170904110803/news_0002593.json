The first year after the Rijksmuseum reopened (five years late) on April 13, 2013, its almost $500-million refurbishment brought in three million visitors -- three times what the museum was attracting annually when it closed the end of 2003. \nThere isn't more art on display or more space to display it: There are still 8,000 items on view in 80 rooms and galleries. But it's not the same 8,000 you would have seen if you'd come in 2003, and the layout is now chronological, with wings devoted to eras from 1100 to 2000. \nPride of place, of course, goes to the Dutch Golden Age, 1600-1700. \n\"Fine\" art is now grouped with \"decorative,\" so oil paintings of a period are next to that age's silver soup tureens, lacquered cabinets and well-wrought cuirasses. The blending gives the viewer a fuller sense of the milieu in which a work was created, and it's a good antidote to room after room of nothing but Old Masters. \nThe exception is the Gallery of Honour, which, like the nave of a cathedral, leads to the museum's high altar -- Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642). This gallery is filled with works by other Golden Age notables including Vermeer, Hals and Steen, but unsullied by lesser items. \nPreviously, the Gallery of Honour was painted white. Now it's been returned to how architect Pierre Cuypers originally decorated it: Warm shades of orange-brown covered by lots of intricate 19th-century designs. The whole museum once looked like this, but only a few sections have been restored -- present-day thinking is that too much Cuypers would still be too much. \nAlso restored are two large courtyards that vanished in the 1960s when more galleries were added. Huge skylights over the courtyards, and the unblocking of windows, have made the museum much airier. \nThe Golden Age galleries are the Rijksmuseum's glory, but it's worthwhile exploring other centuries, too. The 1800-1900 rooms, for example, show not just the era's art (including an 1837 Van Gogh self-portrait), but also Holland's changing place in the world. \nThis was the age of Napoleon, whose end resulted in the creation of the Netherlands in 1815. The Waterloo Gallery is dominated by the eponymous painting (1824) by Jan Willem Pieneman showing the battlefield, with Napoleon's conqueror, Britain's Duke of Wellington, front and centre. \nEven now, not everything is as well laid out as it might be. The two 20th-century galleries in particular seem like afterthoughts, reached by back stairs. But here too are treasures. \nA small chamber displays just two items from the Second World War. \nOne is a chessboard presented by SS commander Heinrich Himmler to the head of the Dutch Nazi party. The \"men\" are planes, bombs and advancing soldiers. The board's sides list the countries the Third Reich has subdued. Next to it is the soiled jacket worn by a woman in a concentration camp. That may be the most heart-rending piece in the whole museum. \nNEED TO KNOW \n-- For more information on the Rijksmuseum, visit rijksmuseum.nl . \n-- For travel information, visit the Netherlands Board of Tourism at holland.com . \nMore stories at culturelocker.com \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
