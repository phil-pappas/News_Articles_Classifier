But Snooty, who will turn 67 on July 21, turns his snout up at that sort of food. Instead, the world’s oldest living manatee, who lives at the South Florida Museum in Bradenton and serves as the area’s mascot, prefers a vegetarian feast — lettuce, carrots, broccoli and sweet potatoes.\nThe 1,020-pound sea cow is having a birthday party on July 18 at the South Florida Museum. Attendees can say hello and sing “Happy Birthday” to Snooty from an underwater view of the manatee pool.\nThis year, Snooty will be inducted into the Guinness World Records as the oldest manatee in captivity. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission experts say manatees in the wild typically die before they turn 15.\nSnooty’s outdoor party is free. Admission to the museum, aquarium and planetarium will be reduced by half that day.\nFor more details, or to see the celebrated sea cow online, visit www.southfloridamuseum.org .\nHemingway Days in Key West\nIn Key West, Ernest Hemingway fans will have a chance to celebrate the late author’s literary genius, love of fishing and island lifestyle during the 35th annual Hemingway Days July 21-26.\nThe Nobel Prize winner, born on July 21, lived in Key West in the 1930s.\nThe week-long celebration includes a Papa Hemingway look-alike contest, prose and poetry readings, a short-story competition, 5k run, marlin tournament, paddleboard race, street fair and the wacky “Running of the Bulls.”\nFor more information, visit www.hemingwaydays.net .\n</span", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T00:12:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
