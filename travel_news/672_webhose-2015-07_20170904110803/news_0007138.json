You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind start s to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Victor Porof /Flickr \n…the Royal Ontario Museum! One of the largest museums in North America, the ROM has more than six million items and forty galleries for you to explore. Its impressive collections of art, world culture, and natural history are world-renowned. It’s no wonder that over one million people come out to visit it every year. Some must-see collections while you’re at the ROM: dinosaurs, minerals and meteorites, Near Eastern and African Art, Canadian History, and Art Deco, With so much to see and explore, you’ll have a hard time figuring out where to go first! Whatever you do, don’t miss out on the Burgess Shale fossils – with over 150,000 specimens in the museum’s collection, it’s the largest in the world.
