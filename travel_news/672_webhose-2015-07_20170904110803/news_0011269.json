As a result, people don't bake cakes as much for everyday occasions, because much of the cake ends up being thrown out. To address this, we are launching the Duncan Hines Perfect Size platform, a complete baking kit designed to serve two to four people. The kit includes the mix, the frosting and a disposable pan, everything you need to create special desserts everyday,\" said Mark Schiller , EVP and President, North American Retail for Pinnacle Foods. \"Today, approximately 60 percent of U.S. households are comprised of only one or two people. Duncan Hines Perfect Size addresses this demographic shift, by providing smaller households an ideal baking option.\"Perfect Size is not only a new category offering for consumers eager to celebrate everyday occasions, but it is truly the first-of-its-kind in market. Bakers simply prepare as directed for a moist, delicious cake that is topped with a rich, smooth and creamy frosting. Through the Perfect Size innovation, Duncan Hines continues its presence at the forefront of the baking mix and frosting category. For perspective, the category declined 6% in 2014, but Duncan Hines grew and gained 1.5 share points. The category experienced similar trends in the first half of 2015 and Duncan Hines continued to gain market share. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:45:56.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
