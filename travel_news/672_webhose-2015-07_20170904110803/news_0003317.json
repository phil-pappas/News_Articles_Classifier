(AFP photo) \nFrom a winter old-school textile, the vintage pattern of houndstooth (pointy-shaped checks) has now become a favourite in other seasons as we. From designers to celebrities, the nifty design that was once primarily used for trench coats, blazers and winter dresses, is now making its presence felt in other seasons as well. \n\"I think it's a welcome change. Houndstooth is a timeless pattern. It looks good on everything. It was generally a pattern woven with wool, but with rising popularity, is now being used as a print for summer wear,\" says designer Pallavi Mohan. \nDesigner Deepika Govind echoes her sentiment, \"Designers have put this print on chiffons and soft muls. Hence, the so-called winter constant has moved into the summer arena.\" \nWhile this pattern, which originated in Scotland, looks classic in black and white, other variations, like black on red, black on beige, and beige on white for a softer look, are also being explored now. In fact, washed yellow on light grey and red on white also work wonders. And if one wishes to keep it simple, then black and white teamed with colour highlights will do the trick. \nOn the other hand, even though traditionally, houndstooth is woven in wool, it is now being used in fabrics such as chiffon, georgette, crepe, mulmul, linen, and cotton, among others. \nNot just clothing, the print is fail-safe when it comes to accessories as well. \n\"It will also look great as a lightweight stole, and can be paired with a plain tee. Even houndstooth print canvas shoes, paired with plain trousers look extremely cool,\" says designer Sougat Paul. \nEnglish model Cara Delevingne (third from left) rocks the pattern in a short skirt. Instead of its classic monochromatic version, the 22-year-old mixes it with colours like yellow and brown, which actually gives surprisingly alluring results. \nMen can also experiment with this pattern to raise their sartorial tempo. From prints on shorts, to T-shirts, houndstooth is pretty unisex in its approach. \nKareena Kapoor Khan recently attended a promotional event in a houndstooth high-neck top. Since it was sleeveless, it gave a sense of summer wear. She paired it with a black midi, and the result was a nifty ensemble. \nEnglish actor Dakota Blue Richards (second from left) mixes a contemporary style - that of a crop top with a body-skimming skirt - with the old-world charm of the houndstooth pattern. \nAmerican actor Olivia Wilde (first from left) sticks to the classic version of the pattern. She opts for a houndstooth jacket and pairs it with a shirt dress for a vintage appeal. \nIf you wish to flaunt this trend, here are some ways you can incorporate houndstooth in your ensemble: \nWear your style * Asymmetric chiffon tunic with houndstooth print, paired with narrow cotton black trousers or cotton-knit leggings.* A sleeveless houndstooth printed top with a white linen jacket and white linen cropped trousers.* A white tee or georgette ruffle top with pencil houndstooth trousers.* A houndstooth georgette shift dress with a white linen peplum jacket.* A houndstooth printed chiffon saree with a solid-coloured blouse.* Houndstooth shorts with a basic white tee.* A waistcoat in houndstooth print, paired with a pair of denim and white shirt. \nDos and Don'ts * Don't overdo the print. Balance it out with a solid coordinate so that it is does not overpower the look.* Don't accessorise too much. You can wear a pair of earrings and a small wristlet that will not attract too much attention.* Don't try to mix too many small prints with it. That will take away from the appeal of the pattern.
