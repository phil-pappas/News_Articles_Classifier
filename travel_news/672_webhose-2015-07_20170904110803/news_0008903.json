In today’s business environment, it’s all about mobility and casting off the shackles of a fixed location, nine-to-five working mentality, so here are some tips on running your virtual office. The cloud really does have a silver lining Cloud computing has transformed the way businesses work. With an internet connection, employees can have access to their data on the cloud from anywhere around the globe. It means a more collaborative approach and also that many people can view and edit the same information at once. Whether it’s web mail, CRM systems or accounting, there’s no longer any need for people to be chained to their desks to have their finger on the button. Commenting on the latest research by the Cloud Industry Forum, CEO Alex Hilton says: “We know that 90pc of organisations using the cloud are satisfied with it – 70pc expect to up their usage over the coming year – and 56pc believe it has provided them with competitive advantage.” Stay on top of your technology If you’re going to make the most of working on the move, you need to make sure that your tech is up to speed. If you’re on the road with no access to an office, you can ePrint documents directly to public HP printers at copy shops or libraries. Similarly, a camera built into a laptop can be as effective as video-conferencing facilities. If your systems won’t facilitate this sort of flexibility, make sure they do. However, organisational behaviourist Monica Parker warns: “Don’t fall victim to techno-bling. Get the basics right first. Use programmes and tools you feel most comfortable with, pay for good infrastructure, and don't be afraid to get help getting set up.” Get a virtual team Many small-business owners face the stark choice between taking on staff that they can’t really afford, or trying to struggle with the admin themselves. But there is another option: why not consider using a virtual PA? Jeanette Hunter, founder of JH Virtual Assistant, says: “Using a virtual assistant can save businesses both time and money. You only pay for the time that your virtual assistant is actually working – so no more covering sick pay or holiday pay. \"Using a reputable service with experienced virtual assistants will free up your valuable time so you can concentrate on your business, rather than the admin.” Present a professional face with flexible office space Feasible as it may be to run your business from your local café or sun lounger in Tenerife, there will be times when you need to demonstrate a semblance of formality and a meeting round your kitchen table might just scupper that important deal. “A professional business address talks volumes in the world of commerce and, with a virtual office, businesses of all sizes can gain an address in the most sought-after of locations. Businesses operating from a virtual office can make significant savings,” says Richard Morris, UK CEO of flexible office provider Regus. “Conducting face-to-face meetings at home, or in a crowded and noisy coffee-shop can be counter-productive. Instead, hiring meeting space for as little as an hour at a time offers a quiet, professional environment and access to any facilities required,” he says. Trust your workforce One of the essential elements in running a successful virtual office is trust. “Thanks to modern technology, putting efficient remote-working processes in place can be done both quickly and easily, but trust in transition can be an issue. Work is something you do, not somewhere you go, and adopting a flexible culture has been proven to cut down on wasted time and cost,” says Phil Flaxton, chief executive of Work Wise UK, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to introduce smarter working practices to businesses across the UK. “Trust and perceived impact on culture are, however, the main barriers to change – not technology.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Five of the best bookkeeping apps for SMEs • Top tips for SMEs on keeping overheads low • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses • Building the right team for your SME • Making flexible working work", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T16:33:24.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
