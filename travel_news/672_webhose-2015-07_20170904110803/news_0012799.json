Here are the city’s main tourist attractions: Baba Tonka Museum \nThe constant exhibition you’ll find at the Baba Tonka Museum will reveal before your eyes a picture of the Bulgarian Revival and Ruse’s role in the process. The museum was opened in 1958 in the house of Baba Tonka’s son, Nikola Obretenov. Except for him, Baba Tonka had 3 more sons that actively participated in the Bulgarian Renaissance, fighting for Bulgaria’s independent religion, education, and eventually, liberty. Here’s what she says about her bitter experience in this reference, “I’ve lost 4 sons: two of them are in the grave, the other two are half-dead. But, even if I had 4 more, I would still make them wear the Bulgarian flag with the golden lion.” In the Bulgarian history this brave woman resembles the image of the Bulgarian heroic mother, devoting her whole family’s lives to the fight for the Bulgarian freedom.
