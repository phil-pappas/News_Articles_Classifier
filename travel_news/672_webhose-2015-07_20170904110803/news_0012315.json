I recently bumped into Kaz Inoue, who moved to the Gold Coast and was invited by Tourism and Events Queensland to be a guest curator of their Instagram account back in2013. \nKaz's own Instagram account is inspirational. \nHer job at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary allows her do exciting things like hosting instameets and her photos were shown in Glasgow, during the Commonwealth Games last year. \nYou can see Kaz's photos of Queensland and find out more about how Queensland has motivated her photography.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:59:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
