Illustration: Jetstar/supplied. A mock-up image of a 50-seat Bombardier Q300 turbo-prop aircraft in Jetstar livery. \nJetstar has announced its executives will make a return trip to Hawke's Bay, just as the design stage for the proposed multi-million expansion of the region's airport terminal takes off. \nWith Jetstar considering Hawke's Bay - along with Hamilton, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Nelson and Invercargill - as potential new destinations as part of a regional expansion, Hawke's Bay Airport Ltd said Jetstar's \"possible\" requirements would be taken into consideration for the design of the $6-8million terminal redevelopment. \n\"We have committed to consult with Jetstar to understand their requirements in the new terminal and to include their requirements in our plans, should they decide to establish services in Hawke's Bay,\" airport company chief executive, Nick Story said \nJetstar will announce its four new regional destinations in September when fares go on sale, with the first flights in December. Regardless of Jetstar's expansion plans, Story said the concept for the terminal upgrade had always included space for another airline, to accommodate the continued projected growth in passenger numbers. \n\"Our annual passenger numbers have grown by 37.5 per cent over the last decade eaching 476,000 in the year to 30 June, 2015. In the next five years they are projected to grow by a further 15 per cent\" \nThe cost of the $6 - $8m project \"had not changed\" as a result of Jetstar's announcement, Storey said. \nThe company's shareholders - Napier city council (26 per cent), Hastings district council (24 per cent) and the Crown (50 per cent) - would be asked to approve a supporting business case for that amount before any works commenced, he said. \nThe hope was for the expansion project to be completed in time for when the region hosted the Te Matatini national kapa haka championships in February of 2017. \n\"That remains our aspirational target given the significant number of visitors expected in Hawke's Bay at that time,\" Story said. \nA new purpose-designed rescue fire station that can withstand a severe earthquake and that is able to be operational during a disaster, will also be part of the project. Ad Feedback \nThe airport began calling for expressions of interest for supply of design services for the proposed terminal expansion and rescue fire station last week. \nImpact Project Management, which is managing the design process for the airport, received over 50 expressions of interest in the first week alone. \nStory said Jetstar's representatives had been \"interested to hear\" about the proposed terminal redevelopment on their initial visit. The airline recently posted on social media it was planning a second visit, asking locals to recommend a good cup of coffee or the best walking or cycling trials. But Storey said he had not been told of an exact date for the visit \n\"We are all excited to read via the Jetstar Facebook page, that [they] are coming back to the Bay for a second visit ... We look forward to welcoming them back and to continuing the conversation with them as to why they should choose Hawke's Bay,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T02:27:58.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
