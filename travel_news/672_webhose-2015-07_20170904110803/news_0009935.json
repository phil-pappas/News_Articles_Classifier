New restaurant brands include Baja Fresh, Hard Rock Café, Red Robin, Schlotzsky’s and Wolfgang Puck Pizza Bar, among other regional chains and independent restaurants. The initiative includes quickservice and tableservice concepts, as well as theme parks, resorts and museums.\n“As we celebrate Kids LiveWell’s fourth birthday, we are tremendously proud of the strides the industry has made to provide healthful kids’ meals to families across the country,” said Dawn Sweeney, President and CEO of the National Restaurant Association. “It’s inspiring to see restaurants in every state and of all sizes making the effort to serve nutritious options for the industry’s youngest patrons.”\n“Healthy Dining is proud to feature the Kids LiveWell menu choices on HealthyDiningFinder.com so that parents can easily find the participating restaurants and qualifying menu choices,” said Anita Jones-Mueller, MPH, President of Healthy Dining. “The growing number of Kids LiveWell menu choices makes dining out a happy and healthy time for families.”\nMany Kids LiveWell participating restaurants are taking part in the program’s fourth birthday celebrations by offering special kids’ meal promotions. The program is also hosting an online birthday party from Kids LiveWell’s Twitter account on Tuesday, July 28, from 1-3 p.m. eastern, featuring games, giveaways and a Q&A with chefs from participating Kids LiveWell restaurants. Join in with the hashtag #4yrsOfKidsLiveWell.\nTo join Kids LiveWell, restaurants agree to offer and promote a selection of qualifying menu items based on leading health organizations’ scientific recommendations, including the 2010 USDA Dietary Guidelines. The initiative focuses on increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and low-fat dairy, and limiting total calories, unhealthy fats, sugar and sodium.\nHealthy Dining’s team of registered dietitians works with restaurants to identify and validate menu choices that meet the program’s criteria.\nSource:- National Restaurant Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T23:02:15.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
