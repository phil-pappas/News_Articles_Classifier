Post a comment now! -2 report reply 1 1 hour, 13 minutes ago by StudiodeKadent Do you know if this will be the A330-300 (or -200V) or A330-200 plane?\nThe -300 (and -200V) has a larger business class cabin with fully flat beds and Sogerma Solstys-style seating. With lots of red Because China.\nIt would be interesting if HK Airlines tries to come more into the Australian market. Sure Cathay would probably be hostile but it would add some competition, and we know QF and Cathay don't exactly have a love-and-cuddles relationship despite both being Oneworld.\n0 report reply 2 50 minutes ago by undertheradar 3 times a week HGK-OOL seasonal services with a CNS 'connection'..will hardly make a dent into QF or CX HKG-BNE services...no threat...time to move on!! lol\n3 report reply 1 47 minutes ago by undertheradar oops HKG..better correct myself before i get abused!! lol\n1 report reply 2 18 minutes ago by riley I think it's more a QLD government deal to funnel cashed up HK tourists into Casino's.", "external_links": ["http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/business/direct-flights-from-gold-coast-hong-kong-coming-soon/story-fnjc2dm2-1227463842540", "http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T07:14:09.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
