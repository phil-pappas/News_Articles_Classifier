The flight plan calls for the SOAREX (Sub-Orbital Aerodynamic Re-entry Experiments) payload (eighth of the series) to be delivered by a suborbital rocket to roughly 250 miles above earth to test new “Exo-Brake” technology — a specially-designed braking device that operates similar to a parachute at extremely high speeds and low air pressures. A new de-orbit technique, Exo-Brakes are being considered as possible solutions for returning cargo from the International Space Station (ISS), orbiting platforms or as possible landing mechanisms in low-density atmospheres.As part of a five-node network, XBee ZigBee will be used to monitor Exo-Brake performance data that encompass 3-axis acceleration parameters as well as temperature and air pressure. The payload avionics will relay the XBee data to earth via an Iridium satellite. Specifically, the XBee modules will be used to create the wireless sensor data network for the Exo-Brake and transfer the data to the Iridium uplink.Digi International is a mission-critical M2M solutions expert, providing the industry´s broadest range of wireless products, a cloud computing platform tailored for devices, and development services to help customers get to market fast with wireless devices and applications.   \n  July 2, 2015 · No comments \nAlaska Airlines said it has   July 2, 2015 · No comments \nQatar   July 2, 2015 · No comments \neMerchantPay   July 2, 2015 · No comments \nAlaska Airlines said it is doing away with the standard fee for the first checked bag for Alaska Airlines Visa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:58:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
