Tourists crane their necks, not a coterie of the city’s coolest—or so it typically goes. But last night the likes of Jim Jarmusch and Jeffrey Deitch turned out to the Clock Tower of Ian Schrager’s still-sparkling New York Edition to do just that. The occasion was to raise a glass to one of rock’s most legendary lensmen, Bob Gruen. He’s the eye behind tenor-setting images—John Lennon, leonine in the “New York City” muscle tee; Debbie Harry, emerging resplendent from the twisted wreckage of a car—and he’s the Edition’s newest permanent resident.\nA selection of 40 of Gruen’s shots are taking up a long-term home in the hotel’s billiard room, just off the Gold Bar, where they hang alongside Maripol’s luridly lovely Polaroids. If it seems like an incongruous spot, perhaps no one is more surprised by the development than Gruen himself: “When I started out in rock ’n’ roll, luxury hotels didn’t admit rock ’n’ roll—they certainly didn’t play it, like we have here in the background!”\nPhoto: BFA.com\nIndeed, it’s a long and curious road from punk’s nascent days to a night out at the Edition. (The legendary Danny Fields was on hand, repping the former.) When this reporter posed that perhaps stars like the ones Gruen had shot had a certain natural flair that runs contrary to 21st-century industry machinations, the photographer was quick to remind that they knew the power of A Look. “A good band always was aware of their image,” he offered. “Rock ’n’ roll is more than just the music, it’s the haircut and attitude. Some bands tried to create an anti-image—‘We’re not posers, and we don’t dress up’—but that’s an image, too.” The kind of images, from Tina Turner and The Glimmer Twins on up to Paul Simonon, that Gruen taps into like no other.\nThe New York Edition , 5 Madison Avenue, New York.", "external_links": ["http://www.editionhotels.com/new-york/restaurants-and-bars", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:25:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
