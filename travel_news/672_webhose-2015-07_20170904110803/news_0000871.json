Every year, usually in summer, I visit a dear friend in the Luberon region of Provence. I went earlier this time, and her cherry trees were heavy with fruit.\nEvery morning, we leisurely picked our breakfast cherries from the lower branches. We tended to polish off a bowl before I got around to using the cherries in desserts.\nOne day, I dispatched my son and another friend higher into the trees to fill bags with more fruit. When they were done, I had several kilos, enough for desserts and savory dishes, salads in particular.\nI love combining cherries with arugula, but this time I had a new idea: a lemony herb salad, much like a classic Lebanese tabbouleh, with lots of parsley and mint, a little bit of fine bulgur and sweet juicy chopped cherries standing in for the tomatoes that were not quite in season.\nMost Read Stories The cop and the courier: Seattle’s top-ticketing officer, and its most-ticketed cyclist If you think New Yorker’s earthquake story is scary, better read this Construction of Pacific Northwest’s largest hotel can begin: city ruling ‘The Really Big One’? Get ready now, quake experts advise Dozens of sturgeon found dead in Columbia River I wanted something nutty in the mix for texture and flavor, so I tossed in a handful of toasted pistachios and used pistachio oil in the dressing. The result is an irresistible salad I am calling cherry tabbouleh.\nLike authentic tabbouleh, it’s primarily an herb salad with a little bit of bulgur and the wonderful juicy surprise of cherries in each bite.\nCHERRY TABBOULEH\nMakes 4 servings\n¼ cup fine bulgur\nSalt to taste\n½ cup boiling water\n1¼ cups finely chopped parsley, tightly packed\n¼ to ½ cup finely chopped mint, to taste, tightly packed\n24 sweet cherries, such as Bing or Queen Anne, pitted and diced\n2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, more to taste\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1½ tablespoons pistachio oil\n¼ cup pistachios, lightly toasted and coarsely chopped\n1. Place bulgur in a bowl. Add a little salt, cover with boiling water and let sit for 20 to 30 minutes, until bulgur is tender and has absorbed most of the water.\n2. Transfer bulgur to a strainer and press out excess water.\n3. Combine the bulgur, parsley, mint and cherries in a large bowl and toss.\n4. In a separate bowl, whisk together lemon juice, salt to taste, the olive oil and the pistachio oil. Toss with salad mixture. Add pistachios, toss again and serve.\nMARTHA ROSE SHULMAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T13:07:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
