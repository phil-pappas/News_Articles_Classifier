Source: AFP \nA HIDDEN tunnel complex that formed Britain’s first line of defence in World War II opened to the public this week after six decades buried as a forgotten time capsule. \nThe underground labyrinth is inside the White Cliffs of Dover, an iconic symbol of England on its south-eastern tip and a natural coastal defence at the closest point to continental Europe. \nStanding at the clifftop entrance, tour guide Gordon Wise looked across the busy English Channel. \n“You can actually see France, 34 kilometres away, just 70 seconds flying time for a shell,” he said as he surveyed the lights, buildings and beaches visible on the other side. \n“You get some idea that this was really the frontline. This was where the defence of Britain had to start.” The tunnel network, 23 metres down inside the chalk cliffs, supported the 185 troops and their four officers who manned three gun batteries and slept in bunks. \nThe digging began after Prime minister Winston Churchill visited Dover in July 1940 and was enraged to see enemy German ships sailing unopposed through the straits between Britain and Nazi-occupied France.

The 325 square metres of tunnels were abandoned in the 1950s and filled in with debris in the 1970s. Only a metal cover plate on the grassy clifftop gave any clue as to what lay beneath.

Some 125 steps down, the tunnels are damp with condensation due to the moist, warm summer air. They smell of the creosote on the wooden support beams. A picture of a face carved into the chalk walls.

It would have been quite hot, noisy and smelly.” A guide poses with a copy of a wartime sketch of the tunnels.

Because of that, it’s kept the tunnels in fantastic condition, which is why they’re a time capsule from the 1940s,” said Barker. \nThe dig also uncovered two rare World War I acoustic mirrors built into the cliff face. \nBefore the advent of radar, the 4.6m diameter concave sculptures concentrated sound waves and gave an early warning on the direction of incoming aircraft, shipping and enemy fire.
