She already suffered from a skin condition before the holiday but it was made worse by the stay in the Dominican Republic. \nBoth holidaymakers have now secured damages from Cook, despite the operator denying liability, after enlisting the help of specialist law firm Irwin Mitchell. Further details of the payouts have not been revealed. \nClare Pearson, an associate with Irwin Mitchell who represented both holidaymakers, said: “This is a terrible situation in which our clients have developed extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing conditions during what was meant to be a relaxing holiday. \n“Sadly such cases are not uncommon and while nothing can be done to reverse the problems Jessica and Aaron have faced, we hope that the settlements will go some way towards helping them to take steps to put these issues behind them.” \nCook has confirmed that it no longer features the Sirenis Cocotal resort and that it takes health and hygiene issues “very seriously”. \n“It is never our intention to disappoint our customers. We are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to Ms Mann and Mr Rigby’s satisfaction, and that we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives,” the company told Mailonline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T05:02:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
