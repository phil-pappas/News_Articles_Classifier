(AP) — A New Mexico dispatcher has resigned after telling a panicked 911 caller who was trying to save the life of a shooting victim to “deal with it yourself.” \nMatthew Sanchez was reassigned after officials became aware of the call, fire officials said on Monday. But a statement Tuesday evening from the office of Albuquerque’s chief administrative officer said that Sanchez has resigned from the fire department. \nThe call was made after Jaydon Chavez-Silver, 17, was shot in June as he watched other teens play cards at a friend’s house in Albuquerque. He later died. Police have not named a suspect and have made no arrests. \nIn the recording obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, the panicked caller snaps at the dispatcher for repeatedly asking whether Chavez-Silver is breathing. Most Read Stories \nDuring the call, the female says, “I am keeping him alive!” \nSanchez asks, “Is he not breathing?” \nThe caller responds, “Barely!” \nShe is then heard frantically encouraging Chavez-Silver to keep breathing. \n“One more breath! One more breath!” she is heard telling the teen. “There you go Jaydon. One more breath! There you go Jaydon. Good job! Just stay with me, OK? OK?” \nThe dispatcher then asks again, “Is he breathing?” \nThe female responded, “He is barely breathing, how many times do I have to (expletive) tell you?” \n“OK, you know what ma’am? You can deal with it yourself. I am not going to deal with this, OK?” the dispatcher says. \nIt seemed from the tape that Sanchez hung up on the caller in mid-sentence. \n“No, my friend is dying .,” she said as the call ended. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to say a dispatcher, not a firefighter, took the 911 call, and that the dispatcher told the caller to “deal with it yourself,” not “herself.” RUSSELL CONTRERAS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T08:59:53.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
