What did you expect?\" \nREAD MORE: Air NZ customer cheesed off at inflight snack \nTo make matters worse, the man said he waited for 15 minutes before having to go back and ask what had happened to the roll, \"which they had totally forgotten about\". \nHowever, he declined to ask for a refund, saying he thought \"it must just be overpriced s*** cause it's an airport\". \nYet his posts prove he was also able to see the humour in the situation:\"As miffed as I was about the terrible service, as soon as I opened it, I burst out laughing, as did my girlfriend because, well, look at it. It's so bad it's funny.\" \nThe Daily Mail said Edinburgh Airport planned to address the complaint with EAT. It was also in the process of trying to track down the customer to offer compensation. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T03:53:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
