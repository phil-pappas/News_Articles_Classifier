Medibank wants hospitals to pay for adverse events. Picture: News Corp Source: TheAustralian\nThe fund also says under the contract it wants Calvary to sign it will no longer pay for 165 preventable adverse events such as giving a patient the wrong blood transfusion, the wrong drug, hospital slips that leave patients needing hip replacements or readmission to remove surgical instruments accidentally left inside the patient.\nMedibank says these adverse events shouldn’t happen and are currently costing its members tens of millions of dollars a year, pushing up premium rates.\nAround 6,000 Medibank patients a year are readmitted to hospital within 28 days of discharge and a portion of these would be the result of preventable causes, the fund says.\n“These events are bad for our members and they result in higher hospital bills, which is a wasted cost. We don’t want to see our members — or any patients for that matter — come to harm while receiving health care,” a spokesman for Medibank said.\nRisky ... Medibank risks losing members to other health funds if it won’t pay full benefits to Canberra’s largest private hospital network. Picture: Thinkstock. Source: Supplied\nAs it renegotiates contracts with private hospitals around Australia Medibank is demanding hospitals for the first time take on the job of paying for these problems themselves.\nHowever, it means the fund is placing itself at risk of an exodus of members who don’t want to run the risk of not being fully covered if they need to use the largest private hospital chain in the ACT.\nCalvary’s national chief executive Mark Doran says the health fund has not even tried to negotiate over the new penalties and is using Canberra as a test case for the rest of the country.\nIf the hospital signs up it means a dying cancer patient discharged from hospital can’t be readmitted for pain relief within 28 days because the fund wouldn’t pay, Mr Doran said.\nThe rules would mean the hospital will have to pay even when the patient contracts an infection in the community.\nHowever, Medibank says its 28 day readmission rule specifically excludes patients where the principle reason for admission to hospital is cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and palliative care.\nUpping prices ... Calvary Hospital says it will have to charge Medibank members $150 a day. Picture: Thinkstock. Source: ThinkStock\nMedibank says people who already have surgery booked at Calvary’s ACT hospitals will continue to be covered, pregnant women will be covered for the next nine months and the chronically ill for the next six months.\nWhile it is out of contract with Calvary Hospital Medibank is required by law to pay its members 85 per cent of the average cost of procedures.\nBut Mr Doran says his hospitals would be losing money if it accepted this as entire payment.\n“We wouldn’t necessarily turn people away but we would have to say there is a fee of $150 a day you have to pay,” he said.\nThe hospital group and the health fund are due to meet with the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to try and resolve the issue on July 21.\nOriginally published as Medibank goes to war with hospital", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227437/481802-76405416-26cc-11e5-9249-f9ea34ff76a1.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/the-health-problems-medibank-wont-pay-for/story-fneuz9ev-1227437482248", "http://www.phio.org.au/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227437/482194-66bb3f9c-26cc-11e5-9249-f9ea34ff76a1.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/10/1227437/481774-2fa4d7a2-26f4-11e5-8167-f00e54f05f28.jpg", "https://www.medibank.com.au/", "http://www.calvary-act.com.au/"], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:13:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
