All crew share in easyJet’s success through an annual bonus and share awards. easyJet has now awarded its UK cabin crew increases of 4.1% for cabin crew and 5.1% for cabin managers over two years backdated to January 2015 on top of an already market leading set of pay and conditions in the UK.\nUNITE’s allegation that easyJet terminated talks is simply not true. We held talks with the union over 12 months including talks facilitated by ACAS last month.\nUNITE wrote to our crew following the ACAS talks stating “should a rejection of the offer be returned, Unite would not enter into any further negotiation”.\neasyJet made more than five different offers and UNITE made no constructive offer during the process.\nAs a result the airline has awarded its cabin crew with the pay increase which was put forward during the pay discussion process.\nWe believe it is right to make the award now since cabin crew, the majority of which are not union members, have been waiting for a conclusion to the pay discussions for a number of months.\neasyJet is disappointed that in a recent Unite pay ballot members voted to reject the offer however we note that the majority of easyJet’s cabin crew are not members of Unite and we estimate that only one in five of easyJet’s UK cabin crew voted against the offer.\nThe offer was well above inflation and above recent pay increases received by BA and Thomas Cook under agreements with UNITE.\neasyJet can confirm it has now been notified of UNITE’s intention to ballot the minority of its crew who are union members for industrial action. We would urge our cabin crew not to vote in favour of industrial action and remain confident we will operate the full summer schedule.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Lufthansa Group increases result in core business Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T16:56:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
