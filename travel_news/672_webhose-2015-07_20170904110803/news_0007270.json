It is too complicated to come to South Africa,” said Air Mauritius regional manager and Barsa chairperson Carla da Silva. \n“The impact of the unabridged birth certificates requirement is still to be seen years down the line, the industry has really been impacted, also from a visa perspective” Barsa chief executive June Crawford said. \nBarsa is the representative association of international airlines flying to South Africa. \nIt has 36 member airlines and represents their interests including negotiating tariffs that airlines pay for use of South African airspace, as well as landing and parking fees at airports, as well as ensuring airlines compliance with the country’s civil aviation laws. \nIt provides a single concerted voice for its members on policy and other matters in relation to the government and other industry stakeholders. \nCrawford said Barsa’s counterparts in other parts of the world had expressed concern about the problems encountered by their passengers intending to fly to South Africa as they were losing passengers on their flights to South Africa. \nShe highlighted two concerns – that the airlines were assisting passengers to help passengers interpret the procedures as well as the lack of consistency in the application of the new requirements on arrival in South Africa. \n“South Africa is the only country that has these requirements,” Da Silva said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T22:24:56.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
