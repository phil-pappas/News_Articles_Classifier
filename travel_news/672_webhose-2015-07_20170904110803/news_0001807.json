The National Park Service on Thursday announced that a new lighting system, using light-emitting diodes or LEDs, is being activated next week on the grounds around the statue. The equipment is coming from Musco Lighting of Oskaloosa, Iowa. It will be turned on at sunset on July 7. The park service said much of the lighting system was installed below ground and damaged in Superstorm Sandy. Musco had installed a temporary system. The new permanent system is expected to reduce energy consumption. Musco systems are also in place at the Washington Monument, the White House and the Flight 93 National Memorial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T21:01:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
