If you simply use social media to connect with friends from the real world that might just seem like another statistic. But if you want to meet new people and find work, behind that number are many potential friends and opportunities. Before social media took off, you often had to ask someone to introduce you to their friend’s uncle’s daughter-in-law’s niece to find someone in your area of interest. Now, you can search for and contact like-minded people directly via a quick tweet or Facebook message, without leaving the sofa. So what are the best ways to connect with people across different social networks? Here are some tips. Pick your platforms You probably have a few social media accounts already. Maybe Instagram , Facebook , Tumblr and Twitter. If not, try some out and stick with the ones you like most. There’s no point using a platform you don’t like just for “networking” purposes – if you don’t enjoy it, it’s unlikely to come naturally anyway. It’s also worth thinking about what platform will attract the kind of people you’d like to meet. If you’re a budding graphic designer, try Instagram. If you’re aiming for a big not-for-profit or company, LinkedIn is a good place to find professional contacts. Write a good bio Describing who you are, and what you do, is one of the most important steps in setting up a social media account. Decide if you intend this social media account for personal or professional use. If you’re planning on using the platform for career growth, include what you do (study, part-time work), and any projects outside school you want to develop. Also think about whether you want to take a stand on an issue you’re passionate about: maybe you’re a human rights advocate, or environmental activist. Start by saying hello This is what it’s all about, after all. There’s no need to be shy – just be real. If you see something you liked from another user, tell them. There are plenty of ways to do this – from direct messages to Instagram photos, retweets to blog posts. You can also be creative, perhaps drawing people , or sharing a poem . Choose your words wisely Even if your account is strictly for personal use, make sure you keep an eye on what you put out there. Be prepared for permanency: posts can linger around the internet a long time, even if deleted from your account. The rise of “digilantism” means that one careless comment can be all it takes to start some serious trouble. Take, for example Justine Sacco’s story – one tweet made her the number one worldwide trend on Twitter. Not a good thing when the tweet was: “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” The backlash was intense, resulting in the loss of her job. The speed at which stories spread on social media isn’t always a negative thing – many have tapped into its potential to solve crimes and show support . But one thing’s for sure – make sure you take the time to think before you hit “Post” and release your thoughts to the world. If you have any doubts, sleep on it, or ask the advice of someone you trust. Above, all – be positive. Use social media to spread more of what you want to see in the world, and to find inspiration and opportunities in turn. Don’t just post recycled facts – share your take on them. People are much more likely to engage with an opinion, and it will help you build an interest-driven group rather than a collection of unengaged followers. • Find more tips for studying, working and gap years on The Axis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:42:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
