But it also comes down to the dollar and cents of it - collecting spare change for charity to dispense to areas in need. American Airlines is one of the airlines that is part of the efforts to bring in change for charities.\nAmerican Airlines is allied with UNICEF's Change for Good program which raised more than $1.2 million in 2009.\nAll funds collected help UNICEF provide children with health care, clean water, nutrition, education and emergency relief.\n\"American Airlines and its participation in the Change for Good program is invaluable to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF for its ability to bring both funding and attention to UNICEF's work,\" stated President and CEO of the US Fund for UNICEF Caryl Stern. \"A little change goes a long way. We are so thankful for the generosity of American Airlines customers and the dedication of the committed American Airlines employee volunteers who choose to help improve children's lives.\"\nHow the program works with American Airlines is similar to the popular Halloween trick or treat - donation box program that UNICEF has had in place for years. So \"Trick-or-Treating for UNICEF\" is available on board select flights, and at domestic AAdmirals Clubs.\nYou can learn more about the program via www.unicefusa.org/changeforgood .\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://www.unicefusa.org/campaigns/changeforgood/"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:48:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
