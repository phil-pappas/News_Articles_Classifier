Their contribution will help in alleviating the suffering of the poor and the vulnerable in Africa. \n“The Dream Children’s Home currently looks after nearly 100 children and this generosity is highly appreciated by all.” \nLinden Coppell, Etihad Airways Head of Sustainability, said: “As an airline we are committed to making a difference to the communities in which we operate. The Dream Children’s Home and Children in Freedom organisation stand out as beacons of hope for underprivileged children in Kenya and we are pleased to be able to support these two important causes.” \nOver 700 blankets were handed over to the orphanage during a visit to the Dream Children’s Home attended by Hassan Issa Al Hosani, Minister Plenipotentiary at the UAE Embassy in Kenya, Joan Mwaniki, Etihad Airways’ General Manager, Kenya, Luzelle Boado Etihad Airways’ Sustainability Officer and Priscilla Chomba, Etihad Airways’ Marketing Coordinator in Kenya. \nNine members of Etihad Airways’ iVolunteer initiative flew to Kenya to provide their time and skills to support the activities which included the task of painting part of the orphanage’s interior with paint donated by the British High Commission in Kenya. \nThe Children in Freedom organisation provides free education, mentorship and support to over 40 young children in several schools in and around Nairobi that will now benefit from the donation of school supplies including literature books and writing materials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:00:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
