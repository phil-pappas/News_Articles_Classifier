No single event has been as startling as the shooting down one year ago of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 . Some 298 people were killed, two-thirds of them Dutch nationals. Today there has still been little progress bringing the perpetrators of this event to justice. \nThe reasons for the crash are fiercely contested between western governments and the Russian authorities. The west believes that the plane was shot down with a Russian supplied anti-aircraft BUK missile system, controlled either by the rebels or by Russian soldiers. There is considerable evidence pointing to this, based on radio intercepts, photographic and video material. But Moscow rejects the claim, arguing that the plane was hit by a missile fired from a Ukrainian fighter jet. More BBC needs reform not evisceration \nThe best hope for establishing exactly what did happen lies with two investigations by the Dutch authorities that are yet to conclude. One by the Dutch Safety Board is set to be published in October but is focused solely on establishing the technical cause of the crash and will not ascribe blame. The national prosecutor in the Netherlands is leading a separate international criminal investigation to establish culpability, but there is no indication when it will finally report. \nNo prosecution can begin until there has been an authoritative account of the facts by these inquiries. But Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has rightly recognised that if justice is to be done, the evidence will ultimately have to be submitted to some kind of judicial authority. He has therefore begun lobbying allies to back the creation of an international tribunal that could one day mount a prosecution. \nThe choice of an international tribunal is a sound one. A similar kind of tribunal has successfully prosecuted war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. But the creation of such a court would need to be authorised by the UN Security Council resolution; and President Vladimir Putin last week told Mr Rutte that setting one up would be “premature and counter productive” — indicating that Moscow would almost certainly use its veto to block it. In depth \nFurther reading \nThe Netherlands and its allies on the Security Council should press ahead with a vote on the matter all the same. If Moscow were to exercise its veto, it would be seen to be the main obstacle to justice after the mass killing of 298 innocent civilians. That would allow the Netherlands to press for specific economic sanctions beyond those that have already been imposed by the US and EU after Russia’s annexation of Cri mea and activities in eastern Ukraine. \nEven if the idea is scuppered at the Security Council, the west should also try to pursue the matter by other means. An international tribunal can be set up by a vote at the UN General Assembly as happened with the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Cambodia established in 1997; or the Dutch government and others could take the case to the International Court of Justice, a UN court in The Hague. The ICJ cannot mount a prosecution. But it can order a state to pay damages, as it did when the US agreed to pay $131.8m after shooting down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf in 1988. \nThe pursuit of justice for the victims of MH17 will be long and hard. What is vital is that the international community does not give up on it. In the years ahead, some government will be tempted to negotiate with the Putin regime for economic and political reasons. But there can be no compromise when it comes to such a dreadful act of mass killing. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
