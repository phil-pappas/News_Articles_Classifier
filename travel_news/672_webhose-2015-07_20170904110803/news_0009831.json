The scheme was later extended to 36 more countries with effect from May. \nUnder the e-visa scheme, an applicant receives an email authorising him or her to travel to India after it is approved and he or she can travel with a print-out of this authorisation. On arrival, the visitor has to present the authorisation to the immigration authorities who would then stamp the entry into the country. \nThe number of foreign tourists availing e-tourist visa facility has increased by over 700 per cent in May as compared to the same period last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:27:06.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
