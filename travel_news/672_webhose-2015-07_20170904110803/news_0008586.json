The latest report from JAMA Internal Medicine found that 75 percent of men and 67 percent of women are now overweight or obese - a sharp increase from 20 years ago when 63 percent of men and 55 percent of women fell into those categories. \n(A person is overweight if they have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25 to 29.9. Those with a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese.) \nWomen were more likely to be obese than overweight, with 37% of women in the former category and 30% in the latter. Altogether, two out of every three women in the U.S. were above a normal weight. \nHealth Costs \nThis - no pun intended - is a very big deal. Carrying too much weight raises the risk of serious, life-threatening diseases including type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. \nBeing obese affects certain recovery outcomes , as well: obese women diagnosed with breast cancer are 35 percent more likely than normal-weight women to die of their cancer. \nObesity is also a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly among women, - and CVD is the leading killer of women in the U.S. \nEconomic Costs \nThe nation pays a high price : the estimated annual health care costs of obesity-related illness are a staggering $190.2 billion, or nearly 21% of annual medical spending in the United States. \nObesity is responsible for higher costs for disability and unemployment benefits. Businesses suffer to the tune of $4.3 billion annually due to obesity-related job absenteeism. \nHealthcare professionals and their patients are grappling with these issues every day, and no one has found any easy answers. But a number of groups are working to increase awareness and knowledge. One such group is the STOP Obesity Alliance , a multi-disciplinary alliance housed at the George Washington University Department of Health Policy; OWL is an associate member. They have a new set of tools to help health care professionals initiate effective conversations about weight and health with their patients. \nFollow Bobbie Brinegar on Twitter: www.twitter.com/OWLNational More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:29:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
