Cards are also still being accepted. \nMeanwhile, agents have also seen the impact of the Greece situation, with customers buying more euros than usual before they travel.Industry sources suggest the overall market from the UK to Greece is down by about 7% for summer 2015 compared with last year, largely due to a notable slump in sales over the past 10 days.
