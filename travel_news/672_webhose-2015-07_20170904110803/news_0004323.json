I say this having had firsthand experience with a belligerent store manager in Grahamstown, where a relative was manipulated into inflating her family income so a retailer could yoke her into buying items she could not afford.\nIt was not even her account but that of her father, a disabled pensioner on a state grant. We discovered this situation once the relative was sinking in debt, failing to service the huge instalment that was swallowing the family income. The instalment, approved by the retailer, amounted to nearly 100% of the pension. When we went into the store to inquire about how they had granted a pensioner so much credit, I wound up in a screaming match with the manager, who refused to answer questions and instead badgered me about my conduct.\nThe relative explained that the store had sent her a promotional \"voucher\". She had bought the goods in the belief that she was getting a deal. Being poorly educated, she did not understand the terms and conditions on the \"voucher\".\nI e-mailed the credit ombud to lay a complaint and was sent a huge form that required getting authorisation from the ailing pensioner before they could look into the issue. Over and above all of this, the pensioner had lost funeral cover because the daughter kept pouring all the money into the furniture account. Faced with a potentially onerous administrative burden, I decided to clear the arrears and helped the relative to better manage the pension so the instalments could be paid.\nThe reality is that the indebtedness of one family member can have a corrosive effect on the whole extended family. But what happens when we multiply the effects of this corrosion across the nation? Like many South Africans, I have especially bitter feelings towards the big furniture shops because of their manipulative sales practices and the fake dreams of \"nice houses\" into which they entice struggling black people.\nMost of us are familiar with these shady practices. It is common to say that they sell credit, not furniture. Therefore, what one wants to see, once and for all, is proper accountability.\nThe National Credit Regulator’s current complaint against Lewis raises questions about the retailer allegedly selling unemployment and disability insurance to the already unemployed, who cannot claim benefits from this insurance. But the regulator needs to commit itself to digging deeper into the sales techniques and credit-approval systems of such retailers because what is at stake here is not merely the micro-level concern of individual clients, but the systemic consequences of reckless lending.\nAfter the collapse of African Bank and its Ellerines outlets, I was sure someone in authority would panic because the lending practices that led to that collapse are widespread.\nHas no one in government asked themselves how many pensioners are being exploited by these greedy retailers, when this money is meant to be a safety net for the poor? In effect, public money is enriching shareholders through the retailers’ unscrupulous lending, which forces pensioners to pay more than they should for credit-bought goods.\nOne imagines that when state welfare grants increase, furniture retail CEOs pop champagne corks in anticipation of higher profits from higher credit approvals.\nWhat are the long-term social, fiscal and economic effects of this? This is a political issue. As a country, we have to realise that recklessly lent retail credit is like a white ant steadily hollowing out our national financial health. The National Credit Regulator must get tough: where retailers are found guilty, they must #paybackthemoney to cheated clients as a deterrent.\n• Mkhize is a lecturer in history at Rhodes University", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:26:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
