Here’s an intriguing idea if you’re bored with your usual Sunday-morning kickaround. Ask every player to don a pair of roller skates or rollerblades. Then play your game of football as normal, relying on your wheels for transport rather than studs or trainers. If that strikes you as impossibly complex, not to mention slightly silly, then you’re probably right. But why should that stop you? And anyway, you’re the one who said you were bored with football. Rollersoccer is far more established than this rather leftfield image might suggest. The first recorded match took place in the early 20th century, and it even has its own World Cup. Just in case you’re wondering, England has never won it, though that’s partly because there aren’t many people who play the sport in this country – yet. Approach it with the right attitude and you’re likely to find it laugh-out-loud funny Things may change if clubs like the London Rollersoccer Club continue to flourish. Based in Chiswick, this club welcomes new members and even holds junior training sessions. So if you live near the capital and want to have a proper go at the sport, this is a good place to start. Alternatively, if you just want a laugh, why not challenge your friends to an informal match? You’re probably best to play on an indoor pitch, as skates won’t fare well on turf. And you may want to suggest that players wear helmets and knee protection, because the risk of plummeting to the ground is likely to be high. Naturally, this adds to the sense of excitement, not to mention the potential to chuckle at your mates. After all, there’s nothing like watching your nearest and dearest make fools of themselves to gladden your heart. Normal football rules apply, and goalkeepers are expected to wear skates as well as outfield players. This makes dead-ball situations interesting, and it takes prodigious skill to kick the ball straight out of your hands. Mind you, you’ll have a great deal of fun trying. That’s the beauty of this peculiar pastime. It’s so outlandish as to be almost impossible to take too seriously, especially if you’re just mucking about with your friends. Approach it with the right attitude and you’re likely to find it laugh-out-loud funny as well as a good form of exercise. You’ll certainly feel the strain after a decent rollersoccer match. Skating works different muscle groups from running, and the constant attempt to maintain balance involves pretty much your entire body. Play regularly enough and your fitness will improve as your skills become more advanced. At the end of it all, who knows? You may wind up representing your country in the next Rollersoccer World Championships. And at the very least, you’ll have found a way to enliven your weekly football session.
