The people responsible received only a verbal warning but no severe punishment.”\nMei adds that local people should also be recruited to ensure tourists respect the structure.\n“Such activities should be carried on for future generations,” he adds.\nIt’s OK now to snap a... ‘Voluntourism’ may be doing...
