The rodent died in the recent run-in with Kimberlee Jaynes' pet Skip, but the Shar Pei and golden Labrador mix got a long scar on his face and was lucky not to lose an eye. \"Skip has a vendetta now,\" said Jaynes, of Portland, Oregon. \"When he sees them, his ears go up — he's looking for them.\"Temperatures are rising, and so are wildlife attacks against pets. Dogs and cats encounter wildlife more often in the summer as people and pets spend more time outdoors and drought and forest fires push wild animals outside their usual territory, veterinarians say. Warmer weather brings out hikers and campers when wildlife is likely to be active and aggressive — often protecting their young broods from perceived threats. In regions suffering from drought, including the Northwest and California, animals from sea lions to bears must search farther for food, sometimes into populated areas. The dry spell also worsens wildfire season, which can leave habitat scarred and meals even harder to find. With these challenges, authorities warn against getting too close to wildlife. As visitors flood national parks and other wilderness areas this summer, attacks against people also have ramped up: Several tourists at Yellowstone National Park have been gored or tossed into the air by bison when they crowded the large animals. After Skip's squirrel encounter, veterinarians at the DoveLewis Emergency Animal Hospital in Portland stitched him up and gave him antibiotics. They also have treated dogs, cats and backyard chickens for attacks by raccoons, coyotes, wild rats and even dive-bombing crows, Dr. Erica Loftin said. Threats can stem from animals that people think are gentle, such as deer, said Dr. Gretchen Schoeffler, an emergency and critical care vet at Cornell University Hospital for Animals in Ithica, New York. Almost any wild animal is capable of striking, from beavers and groundhogs to owls and swans, she said. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T19:20:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
