The dormitory was designed to hold 20 prisoners but currently holds 47.\nAccording to a statement from Sala IV, prisoners “are sleeping on pieces of mattresses or on the ground, putting up with the cold” and rats climbing out of the drains at night.\nThe court ordered prison system director Reynaldo Villalobos Zúñiga and Mariano Barrantes Angulo, director of the San José facility, to take steps to mitigate the overcrowding in the prison within one month.\nLast month the Ombudsman’s Office decried overcrowding across Costa Rica’s penitentiary system, which has ballooned to 53 percent of capacity, according to figures from the Ministry of Justice and Peace.\nThe ministry issued a statement outlining its attempts to curb the problem, but San Sebastián prison was not among the facilities listed where additional cells have been built. Justice authorities claimed that a lack of funding between 2007 and 2009 has had compounding effects on their ability to build new facilities at the same time that courts sent more people to prison.\nThere were 1,266 prisoners housed at San Sebastián as of June 26, according to the Ministry of Justice and Peace.\nThe embattled ministry was under new management as of Tuesday when President Luis Guillermo Solís named María Cecilia Sánchez to replace Cristina Ramírez as Justice Minister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:18:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
