AMELIA ROMANOS Last updated 05:00, July 15 2015 Wilderness Safaris \nWilderness Safaris' Kulala Desert Lodge is on the edge of Namibia's Sossusvlei desert. \nA night out under the stars in a Namibian desert can apparently elicit two very different reactions. \nWilderness Safaris' Kulala Desert Lodge on the edge of Namibia's Sossusvlei desert area gives guests a unique opportunity to sleep in a roof-top \"star bed\". \nMy husband and I jumped at the chance, thinking the potential discomfort of a night outdoors was easily trumped by the uniqueness of the experience. \nThe narrow ladder leading onto the roof of our cabin also put us at a comfortable distance from creatures that might want to join us for the night. \nWe had a mattress and bedding, but we're talking about a fairly thin cushion between us and the concrete floor. \nAs far as outdoor bedding goes it was pretty good, although not a patch on the four-poster, mosquito-netted, super-king bed comfort inside. \nThe view, on the other hand, was extraordinary. \nWith vast empty space surrounding the area for miles, the sky exploded with stars. Whether you know what Orion's Belt is or not, astrologers and laymen could appreciate this. \nThe view from the star bed is hard to beat. Photo: Wilderness Safaris Ad Feedback \nThe deep silence matched the expansive black canvas behind the stars. \nWhen I spoke, I instinctively whispered, as though cutting through the quiet in a normal tone would be somehow offensive. \nWith a winter temperature of about 12C and wrapped in a blanket, I was cosy. \nI drifted off to sleep in perhaps the most calm setting I'd ever experienced. So much serenity. \nA couple of hours later, sometime close to 2.30am, I was ripped from the serenity by my husband's not-so dulcet tones: \"This is insane. I can't take it. We're going inside. We're going inside now.\" \nApparently, he wasn't feeling the zen I was. \nAlready halfway down the ladder leading to indoor civilisation, he was describing the 180 minutes of misery he'd been enduring while I slumbered. \nBugs appeared to be the biggest problem. Both real and fictional. He said every time he closed his eyes he'd hear mosquitoes buzzing loudly around his face. \nFor several hours he'd apparently been alternating between arms under the blanket to try to keep warm, and arms flailing in the air to stop the flying monsters making a meal out of him. \nDriven to a new level of crazy by insects and insomnia, his imagination added to the nightmare. \nMy wake up call appeared to have come once he convinced himself that giant man-eating spiders, scorpions and snakes were nesting within millimetres of us. \nI hadn't seen any evidence of bugs and I was snug as a bug, so being woken up by the crazy man next to me was actually the most negative part of my outdoor kip. \nBut, not wanting to provoke the beast further, I followed him inside. \nI'm going to assume that many others don't make it through the night - as well as setting up the roof-top bed, the lodge's staff had made up our inside bed, complete with hot water bottles. \nAnd while I wasn't necessarily happy to come in out of the fresh air at first, I'll admit there's something to be said for fully fledged comfort. \nAh, the serenity. \nIF YOU GO: \nAdventure World offers package deals at Kulala Desert Lodge that include return flights from Windhoek Airport, all meals, local drinks, camp activities and park fees.
