I have few peaks in my mind like Stok Kangri/Chamser Kangri which i want to do solo so the food needs to be very easy to carry( i mean not bulky packed and all) , very nutritious and high in calories and ofcourse most important should not take much time to cook. Few of them i can figure out are chocolate bars, dry fruits etc but mainly talking about foods which needs bit of cooking . I am expecting about 1kg-1.5kg of food for 3 days atleast to sustain myself in the mountains i know Rajma(kidney beans) are strict no no because they take lot of time to cook so Please suggest . Lot of experience mountaineers here for sure can share in some of their experience regarding food. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:13:27.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
