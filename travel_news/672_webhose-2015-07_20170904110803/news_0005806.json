It provides you with free or reduced-cost healthcare to the same level as residents of the country you are travelling to, so it can come in very handy should anything unforeseen happen. However, there is some key information that you should know before you travel. \nWhere Is It Valid? \nThe first thing to know about the card is where it is valid, which is EEA countries. You can find a full list of countries in the EEA on the NHS website. Always check to make sure the country you're travelling to is covered so that you know where you stand. \nCosts Involved in Receiving Treatment \nIt is a common misconception that all treatment is free upon presentation of the EHIC card. In fact, you will often be expected to pay something towards the cost of your treatment. This is more common in some countries than others, and it also depends on the type of treatment you are receiving. For example, it may be free in some EEA countries to visit a doctor, but in others you may have to pay a nominal or even considerable amount. If you need a prescription, you may also have to pay for this. \nThe only way to know in advance is to check the up to date information on the official NHS website, where you can find out what you will be expected to pay for in each country. \nApplying for Your Card \nTo apply for the EHIC card you should head to the official NHS website. Here you can fill out a form with your details (or contact them by phone) and the card will be sent to you without any cost. If you are asked to pay for the card you may have ended up on a fake website that is trying to make money unscrupulously. Also, you need to remember that everyone who is travelling will need their own card. So if you are travelling with children, make sure you apply for separate cards for each of them. \nDo Some Research and Be Prepared \nMake sure you know exactly what is and isn't covered when you apply for your EHIC card. Don't make any assumptions and always make enquiries through the official channels if you have any doubts or questions. Source:   ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nP.K.
