It was ranked in the 10th place for Argentinian exports, and in recent years it has ranked in the fourth or fifth place,” said Rodriguez.\nWhile Argentina is the world’s fifth-largest producer of wine, it represents a scant 1.01 percent of China’s wine imports, which have seen explosive growth of at least 400 percent in the past five years.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Argentina exported to China 83.2 million U.S. dollars worth of wine, 17.7 million of which was sold last year.\nRelated Posts TAT, Eyeing China’s Luxury Markets, Invites 30 Medical Facilitators and Travel Agencies on FAM Trip to Showcase Thailand’s Health and Wellness Services Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Argentinian travel agency to pay $2.8 million fine for violating Cuba embargo Space Expedition Corporation will charge USD 217,000, for Orbiting the Earth in Just Six Minutes Tourism Authority of Thailand to open new office in China’s Guangzhou", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:44:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
