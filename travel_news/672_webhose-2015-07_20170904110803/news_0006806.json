Seattle is becoming dependent on special levies. Income inequality remains problematic. The police department is under federal oversight. The Port, along with the middle-class jobs associated with it, is threatened.\nThe Times recommends: Lorena González\nSeattle City Council Position 9\nStrengths : Critical, independent thinking; history of overcoming challenges\nAs former legal counsel to Mayor Ed Murray, González’s job was to offer no-nonsense advice on policies, such as land use, affordability, police reform and implementation of labor standards. ...\"\nOf four candidates, Lorena González stands out as the most compelling choice to tackle those issues.\nAs former legal counsel to Mayor Ed Murray, González’s job was to offer no-nonsense advice on policies, such as land use, affordability, police reform and implementation of labor standards.\nWhat matters in your Seattle council district? What is the most important issue in your neighborhood? Send in your opinion and we’ll map the responses to find out what matters most in each City Council district.\nHer ability to think critically and independently is no surprise. She has a storied history of overcoming challenges.\nGonzález earned her first paycheck at the age of 8 as a migrant farmworker with her family in the Lower Yakima Valley. After working her way through college, she became a civil-rights attorney and served as president of OneAmerica.\nIn private practice, González sued, then settled with SPD on behalf of a man seen in a 2010 video being unnecessarily threatened by an officer. She supports stronger citizen oversight of the department through a robust Community Police Commission.\nThough she agrees the city had a role to play in challenging the nature of Shell’s permit with the Port she disagrees with the way that issue became politicized. She advocates for a regional strategy on the Port.\nShe is smart on housing policy, recognizing the need to increase supply while ensuring developers are not causing displacement by converting existing stock into expensive housing.\nVoters should elect González.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
