This is the 300th wish for which Allegiant has provided complimentary travel since 2012. Serena and her family will be greeted by Allegiant employees at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas for a special wish sendoff celebration.\nSince the start of Allegiant’s relationship with Make-A-Wish in August 2012, Allegiant has provided travel for 300 wish kids and their families, totaling over 1,200 donated tickets and almost $300,000 in cash sponsorships. Allegiant flew more than 150 wish kids, like Serena, to their wish destination in 2014 alone.\n“We’re extremely excited to celebrate this 300th wish milestone, and we hope Serena and her family have a great time on their trip,” said Brian Davis, Allegiant Travel Company vice president of marketing. “Allegiant team members are passionate about our relationship with Make-A-Wish and making wish flights a special experience for the families.”\n“Allegiant is a terrific sponsor that plays an important role in getting wish kids to destinations for life-changing wish experiences,” said Kathy Forshey, vice president, corporate alliances for Make-A-Wish America. “The Allegiant team members welcome each one of our wish kids and their families while traveling on their wish.”\nAllegiant’s relationship with Make-A-Wish includes providing nonstop flights for wish kids and their families, helping to fulfill some of the nearly 75 percent of all wishes that involve travel.\nSource:- Allegiant\nRelated Posts Allegiant Air celebrates its 300th Flight with Make-A-Wish Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building MIA Director, National Counterparts Travel To Washington, D.c.
