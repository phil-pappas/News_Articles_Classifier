Carter Smith | Bloomberg News. An oil tanker navigates the Houston Ship Channel in Houston, Texas. Gasoline prices have been dropping, and are far below last year’s levels — but they could be lower still if the United States lifted the ban on exporting crude oil, according to a new study from IHS Inc. The Douglas County information and consulting firm (NYSE: IHS) said lifting the ban on crude oil exports “would actually lower U.S. gasoline prices an average of 8 cents per gallon by encouraging greater U.S. crude production.” More oil on the market would cause international prices to fall — and bring down U.S. gasoline prices as well, the report said. That’s because even though the U.S. oil and gas industry has produced record-setting levels of crude oil in the last few years, gasoline prices are still a function of the ups and downs in the international market. The new report, “Pump Primer: How U.S. Gasoline Prices are Set,” is part of a series of reports IHS has done focused on the United States crude oil export policy. The study is available here. For example, the study found that the wholesale price of gasoline in the inland Chicago market tracked the international price of oil — even as U.S production grew and the wholesale price of crude oil near Chicago dropped lower than the international price. The average price for regular gasoline in Denver is $2.77 per gallon, down 22 percent from $3.56 per gallon a year ago, according to AAA’s Daily Fuel Gauge report. Statewide, the average price is $2.80 per gallon for regular gasoline, down 22 percent from $3.61 per gallon a year ago. Nationally, the average price is $2.68 per gallon, down 24 percent from $3.51 per gallon a year ago. The study answers one of the questions raised about the consequences of lifting the export ban on crude oil, IHS said. Export restrictions on U.S. crude date back to the 1970s. “This latest analysis further confirms what IHS research has consistently shown – that the fear that lifting the ban on U.S. crude exports would raise U.S. gasoline prices is unfounded” said Kurt Barrow , IHS’s vice president for downstream energy. The reason gasoline prices follow the international market is because gasoline trades on the international market — U.S. crude oil doesn’t,” Barrow said. Removing the export ban on U.S. crude oil would increase international supplies of crude and thus international crude oil prices — the major factor in setting gasoline prices around the world, Barrow said. \nWant St. Louis Travel news in your inbox?
