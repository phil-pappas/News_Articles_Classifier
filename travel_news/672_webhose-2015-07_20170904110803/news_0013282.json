A few restaurants to consider: \n• Clam Digger, St. Andrews-by-the-Sea, New Brunswick, 506-529-8084 \n• Harraseeket Lunch and Lobster, 207-865-3535, www.harraseeketlunchandlobster.com \n• The Lobster Shack at Two Lights, 207-799-1677, www.lobstershacktwolights.com \n• Quoddy Bay Lobster, 207-853-6640 View Slideshow Request to buy this photo Steve Dolinsky/Chicago Tribune/TNS At Quoddy Bay Lobster, the rolls have a bit of mayo to hold the roughly chopped claw, knuckle and tail meat together. They're then topped with a fully intact, steamed claw. \nEASTPORT, Maine — A lobster claw the size of an iPhone 5 sits perched atop my lunch, obliterating any chance I have to see the quarter-pound of chopped lobster meat, lightly dressed with mayo and tucked into a split-top hot dog bun that has been grilled with butter on both sides. \nThe lobster roll at Quoddy Bay Lobster, an industrial-looking blue aluminum shack on the eastern lip of the United States, isn’t my first, but it’s certainly the freshest, most delicious version I’ve ever had. \n“We feed people the way we feed our fishermen at home,” said Sara Griffin, who runs the fishing co-op and restaurant with her family. That means instead of celery, drawn butter or lettuce, a bit of mayo holds the roughly chopped claw, knuckle and tail meat together, topped with a fully intact, steamed claw. \nQuoddy Bay began as a Thursday-only chowder joint eight seasons ago. The staff now goes through about 100 pounds of live lobster every day of summer. \nThe vibe there is serene. Diners sit on wooden picnic tables as blue as the water just a few yards away. \nWhile some fishing towns in New England have added melted butter, celery and lettuce to their lobster rolls, Maine’s fishermen seem to think less is more. Even mayo is considered sacrilege in some areas. \nWith my family, I drove south along Maine’s coast on a lobster-roll lover’s tour the week before Labor Day, the height of lobster season on the East Coast, starting in New Brunswick, Canada, and ending up in Portland, Maine. \nThe area of St. Andrews-by-the-Sea in New Brunswick, known for whale-watching excursions and sea kayaking, has several restaurants that offer lobster rolls. \nThe Lilliputian rolls at St. Andrews-by-the-Sea’s Clam Digger were dressed simply with lettuce and a few lemon wedges. \nDown in Maine, the state is on a roll, boasting historic lobster catches the past three years, according to the state’s Department of Marine Resources. More than 120 million pounds were landed each of the years, supplying 85 percent of the country’s fishmongers. That lobster roll you had last week in Chicago, Dallas or San Francisco? Chances are it came from Maine. \nIf the road to Quoddy Bay is a winding, twisting odyssey, the journey down U.S. 1 is a meandering sojourn past antique shops and seafood shacks. We stopped in Ellsworth at the Union River Lobster Pot (not open for lunch) and passed on the famous Red’s Eats in Wiscasset — too long of a line. A good friend recommended Dolphin Marina in Harpswell, half an hour from where we were, but we were hungry after an hour or two of shopping and drove 10 minutes toward the water. \nBrendon Alterio sported a toothy grin while wearing his daily uniform — a golf visor and T-shirt with the Harraseeket Lunch and Lobster logos. Alterio has a permanent tan from watching his eight lobster boats come in each day from Casco Bay. The business is in its 46th year, and its daily lines reflect a loyalty that extends beyond state lines. \nThe rolls begin with lobster that is first boiled. Professional “pickers” come in to separate the meat from the shells. A bit of mayo, some salt and pepper are all the seasoning they get. There are 31/2 ounces of barely dressed meat stuffed into the buttered and griddled Sunbeam buns, which have a thin layer of green leaf lettuce at the bottom. \n“We keep it basic so you get the true flavor of the meat,” Alterio said, echoing sentiments of his fellow fishermen. That philosophy, as simple as it is, results in about 500 lobster rolls a day during the summer. \nIn Portland’s hip India Street neighborhood, I couldn’t help but notice the enormous bar housing a granite slab jammed with ice and nine types of regional oysters. Eventide Oyster Co. is much more than an oyster bar. It has a rare menu, forcing impossible-to-decide dilemmas between creative raw crudos, full-on lobster bakes and unctuous seafood stews. The signature lobster roll, doused in a bit of brown butter and served in a puffy split-top Asian bun, is certainly not traditional, but it’s also not to be missed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T15:03:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
