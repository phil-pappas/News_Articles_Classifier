Is there an unofficial in-flight etiquette? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nCommonwealth prosecutor Rebecca Blaszczyk said witnesses reported Diedrichs became agitated and began pushing, kicking and kneeing the man's seat, making \"violent gestures\", and speaking in an aggressive tone. FROM THE ARCHIVE Diedrichs, a roofer, arranged to move seats but not before forcefully striking the reclining passenger's headrest and later returning to verbally abuse him. \nBlaszczyk said the male passenger reported suffering whiplash injuries from the blow to his headrest. \nDiedrich was genuinely embarrassed, according to his lawyer, who said the outburst was caused by the stress of not receiving payment for some work he had completed. \nNevertheless Magistrate Bronwyn Springer imposed a $600 fine and told Diedrich he was lucky he wasn't facing an assault charge. \n\"Being in an aircraft, it is a confined space, it can get out of control,\" she warned. \"People's emotions have to be kept in check.\" \nOutside court, Diedrichs said he regretted the incident but only became angry when the other passenger responded rudely to him. \n\"It's a short flight, no one reclines their seat between here and New Zealand,\" he said. \n\"I did ask nicely and it was the response I got, that's what fired me up. \n\"I'm not a violent person, I'm not an angry person, it was just bad timing.\" - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:43:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
