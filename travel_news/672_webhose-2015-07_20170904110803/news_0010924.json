Regional Express (Rex) is Australia’s largest independent regional airline operating a fleet of more than 40 Saab 340 aircraft on some 1,300 weekly flights to 53 destinations throughout New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Queensland. The Rex Group comprises Regional Express, air freight and charter operator Pel-Air Aviation and Dubbobased regional airline Air Link, as well as the pilot academy Australian Airline Pilot Academy, and MRO company AVIEX.\nSource:- REX\nRelated Posts BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Rex Awarded Area Air Operator’s Certificate by CASA NATS launches London Airspace Consultation TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Qatar Executive To Exhibit At Leading Business Aviation Show In Dubai", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T14:08:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
