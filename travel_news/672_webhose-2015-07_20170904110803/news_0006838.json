We want the officials to feel safe.”\nPODCAST: PHIL ROTHFIELD AND DEAN RITCHIE ON THE FIFITA SCANDAL\nAndrew Fifita has struggled with depression, a fact Cronulla will digest when discussing any possible punishment.\n“There’s a lot of things that will go into it — the player’s welfare, his health. We all know where Andrew has been before,” Flanagan said.\n“We’re not making excuses here, as the club will deal with it really strongly. As I said the right people are in control of that.

Source: News Corp Australia\nFifita made a number of errors in Sunday’s game against Canterbury in a performance Flanagan described as “indifferent”.\n“We need all the information — we haven’t got all that as yet,” Flanagan said.\n“We’ll definitely deal with it as a club and be really strong. As quick as we can do it, we’ll do it. His performance today was indifferent.\n“He had some real good carries but gave away a few penalties — he had a bit on his mind I suppose.”\nSharks skipper Paul Gallen added: “I thought he tried really hard, probably too hard. He got pulled up on his play-the-ball, which is something Flanno has been telling him every week for a while.\n“He’s got to fix those little things. The other stuff, I got to the bus not knowing anything about it. I make a plan of not reading the papers and staying off social media on game day.”", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/26/1227457/788451-2e184a50-3382-11e5-a1ed-b0a27ed9031c.jpg", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/216397506&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"], "published": "2015-07-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T02:33:13.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
