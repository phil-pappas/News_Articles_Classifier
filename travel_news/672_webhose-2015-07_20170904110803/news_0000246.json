Additionally, according to the survey, the primary role that loyalty programs play for Travel Managers is encouraging corporate travel policy compliance and driving greater volume to preferred hotels. The study also uncovers that one-third of Travel Managers say they actively inform travelers about hotel loyalty programs.\nAccording to the study, 78 percent of Travel Managers are allowed to use individual hotel loyalty accounts when traveling for business. Travel Managers almost universally say travelers can keep the points or rewards earned through business travel for their own personal use.\n“Most loyalty programs reward individual travelers for staying at hotel chains, but these programs can also align with the goals of corporate travel programs to promote compliance, improve traveler satisfaction and extract value from hotel stays,” said Joseph Bates, GBTA Foundation vice president of research. “While the primary goal of loyalty programs is to incentivize travelers to be brand loyal, continued partnerships with Travel Managers should prevail.”\nThe study also found high interest in both corporate hotel loyalty programs and adding incentive to individual programs to encourage booking through authorized channels. A large majority (77 percent) of Travel Managers are “somewhat interested” or “very interested” in a corporate loyalty program that rewards companies through various discounts and perks and 72 percent are also “somewhat interested” or “very interested” in allowing travelers to belong to individual loyalty programs to accrue points more quickly if they booked through a channel agreed upon by both the Travel Manager and the hotel.\nRelated Posts Country-specific economic trends to effect business travel in 2014 Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units TIA welcomes the New Zealand Story Atlanta bound Spirit airlines flight make emergency landing at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T02:09:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
