Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Havana's José Martí International Airport (HAV). JetBlue becomes the first major U.S. carrier to fly the route since travel restrictions were eased earlier this year. \nWith the addition of the flights between New York and Havana, JetBlue now operates five weekly round trips to Cuba, including flights from Tampa (TPA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood (FLL) with various charter partners. As the largest U.S. airline to the Caribbean, Cuba will one day play an important role in JetBlue's overall network in the region. \n\"JetBlue already has a proven track record of providing outstanding service to the Caribbean and has operated a series of successful charters to Cuba since 2011,\" said Scott Laurence, senior vice president airline planning at JetBlue. \"As interest in Cuban markets grows, JetBlue is positioning itself as a leading carrier to the island nation by operating more convenient flight options than ever.\" \nThe New York-Havana charter service was announced in May shortly after a successful trade mission trip to Cuba with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. The Governor, joined by JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes and other New York business leaders, led a dialogue to connect Empire State businesses to new opportunities in Cuba. \nCuba Travel Services is offering the flight, operated by JetBlue, on Fridays from New York. Travelers should make arrangements directly with Cuba Travel Services ( www.cubatravelservices.com ). \nCuba Travel Services, a leading authorized carrier service provider, believes expanding its flight network will provide licensed travelers more travel options for a lower cost. The additional service offers customers additional options to travel to Cuba from New York nonstop. \nAbout Cuba Travel Services \nCuba Travel Services Inc. arranges daily, non-stop public charter flights between the United States and Cuba and is licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as an authorized Carrier Service Provider specializing in travel to Cuba.
