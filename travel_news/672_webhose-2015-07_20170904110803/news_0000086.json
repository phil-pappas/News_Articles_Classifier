The Beardmore, which specialises in national and international medical and healthcare conferences and events is one of only 32 venues to have received this accreditation following evaluation of more than 20,000 pieces of feedback from 360 venues throughout the UK from July 2014 to June 2015. \nThe Beardmore which is the only Scottish member of ‘Conference Centres of Excellence’ and IACC, the International Association of Conference Centres is to rebrand as the Golden Jubilee Conference Hotel in early 2016. The market research agency BDRC Continental award the Gold Standard, to only those venues achieving a twelve-month Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +70 (scores range from -100 to +100). NPS is a progressive measure of customer service performance which acknowledges the power that excellent service has when it comes to driving positive word of mouth for a brand. Bronagh Bell, Director of the Beardmore Hotel and Conference Centre, said: “After receiving Gold Standard Accreditation for every quarter in 2014, we have very high standards to maintain. We have recently redesigned our Events Team to increase planning time with each client so that they can achieve their success goals. “We are delighted to receive our sixth Gold Standard Accreditation in a row. This is a fantastic, highly regarded and well earned accolade for our team, who continually deliver a high quality service. We would like to thank all of our customers for the incredible responses that made this possible.” James Bland, Director Hotels and Hospitality at BDRC Continental, congratulated the Beardmore on its achievement saying: “We are very strict in our criteria, and only a select group of venues around the UK have what it takes to meet the standard to achieve Gold Standard Accreditation. To do so requires organisations to meet a diverse and specialised series of objectives, with consistent dedication to improvement and delivering excellence across their service and the team at the Beardmore should be extremely proud.” Bronagh added: “Our 2020 Strategy continues to develop the Beardmore as a world class conference and meeting centre and will allow us to keep finding pioneering ways to support high level international, medical and innovative conferences and events whilst cultivating an environment to enable delegates to collaborate, share ideas and undertake ground breaking research and innovation projects. “Going forward we will be continuing to develop our infrastructure by investing in technology, upgrading our sleep accommodation and meeting facilities and continuously aiming to find new ways to provide the high standard of service that put the Beardmore on the Map.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T20:44:24.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
