Managing director Raul Bustamente told The Associated Press Wednesday that 144 workers have been laid off. He said the closure comes after a 40 percent drop in the use of slot machines in the past decade. Bustamante said the former 24-hour casino that opened in 1975 will likely be turned into a ballroom. Puerto Rico's Hotel & Tourism Association said it is the seventh casino to close in the past five years in Puerto Rico. Government officials have said the previous closures led to a $6 million drop in revenue. Critics in part blame the closures on an estimated 45,000 illegal gambling machines that operate across the island.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T00:40:49.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
