Additionally, Hornblower Cruises & Events is the parent company to concessioners for Alcatraz Cruises, Statue Cruises and Niagara Cruises. For those looking to spend time on the water this summer, Hornblower Cruises & Events offers some of the country’s top attractions and cruises, as follows:\nAlcatraz — Recently named as the #1 attraction in the USA by TripAdvisor and #8 worldwide, this former prison is one of America’s most recognized world attractions. Alcatraz is often associated with Chicago crime boss Al “Scarface” Capone, who was imprisoned in Alcatraz in the 1930s. In fact, many A-list criminals passed through this former maximum-security penitentiary, including dapper kidnapper George “Machine Gun” Kelly and Morton Sobell, the military contractor found guilty of Soviet espionage along with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. But a tour to this National Park is more than just seeing the inside of an old prison. Visitors also see some of San Francisco’s top attractions on the scenic ferry ride across the bay to Alcatraz, including the Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge and Angel Island (the Ellis Island of the west). www.alcatrazcruises.com\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island— An American architectural icon, “Lady Liberty” proudly stands on Liberty Island, guarding the entrance to New York Harbor. The 305-foot Statue of Liberty was given to the United States from France to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the young country’s independence. Once on the island, guests can visit the Statue of Liberty Museum to view the original torch and an explanatory exhibit before taking in a close-up view of the Statue of Liberty on the 10th floor. A tour to Liberty Island from NYC is a great way to see this iconic landmark. www.statuecruises.com\nNiagara Falls — Pounding water, glistening mist and an engineering feat…is it any wonder Niagara Falls is a top tour in Canada? Located at the border of Ontario and New York, Niagara Falls combines the brute force of water with engineering to create magnificent waterfalls. Whether visitors witness Niagara Falls via boat, helicopter or from the Observation Tower, spectators marvel at the amount of water crashing through the falls each second.\nWhale Watching in San Diego — Hornblower Cruises & Events’ San Diego port has launched their seasonal Blue Whale Watching Adventures cruises, which are available through September 6, 2015. Departing from the convenient location of Embarcadero downtown San Diego at 970 North Harbor Drive, daily tours start boarding at 8:45 a.m. for the 9:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. daily excursion.

During the four-hour tour, passengers will be treated to a live narration by an experienced captain and an on-board naturalist (from the San Diego Natural History Museum).\nNew York Imbible Cruise — For those feeling stuck on land, join Hornblower Cruises & Events and the cast of “Imbible” on the high seas for pirates, sea shanties, rum drinks and more. Passengers are welcome aboard to down new rum cocktails while experiencing the best views New York City has to offer from the East River with Lady Liberty herself. Created by world-renowned mixologist, spirits educator and author Anthony Caporale, “The Imbible: Rum Drinks…And Pirates!” tells the story of rum from its origins right up to modern-day. Join the cast of Imbible for their thirty-minute musical spectacular and gain access to this exclusive experience by anchoring on the Private Pirate Deck to learn all about the history and science of cocktails.

Must be 21 and older to attend, scheduled for Thursdays and Sundays through September 6, 2015.\nHistoric Harbor Tours of the Marina — To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Marina del Rey, Hornblower Cruises & Events Marina del Rey Port is celebrating the occasion with a $1 (yes one dollar) per guest tour where passengers will enjoy the sight of Marina del Rey from the comforts of a classic yacht. Available through September 6, 2015. The 45-minute tour is narrated by one of Hornblower’s Captains with information about local landmarks and 50 year history, features sightings of local marine life and an introduction to local environmental efforts.\nNewport Beach Wild Goose Dockside Tour — Passengers are invited aboard to experience one of the most famous yachts in Newport Beach, the Wild Goose. Once the yacht of acting legend John Wayne, this legendary vessel boasts an impressive history. The tour includes informative narration that guides passengers throughout the yacht, highlighting interesting facts and intriguing stories.\nSan Francisco Dinner Cruise — For those interested in taking in the stunning views of the San Francisco Bay, passing by two of the top ten attractions in the United States (Alcatraz and Golden Gate Bridge), this 2½ hour cruise is available on Friday and Saturday nights, with boarding at 6:30pm.
