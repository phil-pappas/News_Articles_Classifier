Many retailers have already started marketing through online channels.According to the report, Americans are showing an increased interest in undertaking adventurous activities. Increased urbanization and immigration have led to overcrowded cities and mobile, fast-paced, and polluted environments, increasing consumers' preference for nature-based outdoor adventures. People's interest in their heritage, both nature based and culture based, and outdoor adventure travel have risen. People seek hard adventure opportunities to explore new places while staying close to nature and enjoying time with family and friends. All these factors have helped adventure tourism gain momentum and popularity among travelers, directly increasing the sales of hard adventure equipment in the US.Further, the report states that non-professional and irregular hard adventurers prefer renting over purchasing, which will further hinder manufacturers from penetrating the untapped market in emerging regions such as MEA.
