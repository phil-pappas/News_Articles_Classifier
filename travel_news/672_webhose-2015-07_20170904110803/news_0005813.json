RM1.368 billion), contributing to a two per cent rise for the full first semester of 2015. \nThe company said sales had dipped by two per cent in the first quarter due to the impact of jihadist attacks in Paris and closure of the Eurotunnel due to a fire. \nTraffic on the network linking cities including London, Paris, Brussels and Lille was bolstered in the second quarter by more than 88,000 tickets sold on a new route launched in May between the UK capital and Lyon, Avignon and Marseille. \nSeeking to accommodate and fuel continued passenger growth, Eurostar is preparing to add a new line of e320 trains with remodelled interiors and increased seating capacity by the end of the year. \n“With demand for our services at an all-time high we are looking forward to the arrival of our new trains,” said Eurostar CEO Nicolas Petrovic. \n“The combination of state-of-the-art design, unrivalled comfort and 20 per cent extra seats means that we are well placed to meet the growing demand as passengers increasingly opt for high speed rail over plane.” — AFP Relaxnews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:25:33.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
