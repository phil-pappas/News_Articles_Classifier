The only down season is for about two weeks at the start of December. But the island has many affordable options for food, lodging and entertainment, and some attractions — the beach, beautiful drives — are free.\n“There’s such natural resources around that it’s easy to enjoy yourself without spending a lot of money,” said Keli’i Brown of the Maui Visitors Bureau.\nHere are a few ways to take an affordable trip to Maui.\nBeaches Enjoying Maui’s world-class beaches usually doesn’t cost anything, except for a few in resort areas that have pay parking lots.\nThe island has 81 beaches and 120 miles of coastline, with sands of gold, black, green, red and white. Kaanapali and Wailea beaches are in resort towns and tend to be the most popular. Other beaches are less crowded, like Big Beach in Makena State Park on the south shore.\nThe water is spectacular for snorkeling, filled with colorful tropical fish and sea turtles. Equipment rental for a week is typically around $20; some hotels offer free gear to guests.\nHo’okipa Beach on the north shore is one of the world’s best places to watch windsurfers, too.\nCulture A traditional Hawaiian luau can be expensive, many starting at $90 or more.\nAn easy way to get a taste of Hawaiian culture is to find local performers around hotels and resort areas.\nThe Lahaina Cannery Mall has free hula shows and offers ukulele lessons weekly. Many hotels along Kaanapali Beach have nightly performers in bar areas, including Whaler Village and Kaanapali Beach Hotel.\nGo for a drive The road to Hana is one of the most famous scenic drives in the world, a winding 52-mile road along the north shore that has 54 one-lane bridges and is lined with waterfalls, incredible tropical foliage and lava shores.\nAnother option is to take Highway 340 between Kahului and Kapalua around the rugged northwest end of the island. The narrow, winding road is a little more dangerous than the Hana Highway.\nThe trip is filled with spectacular views of the coast, fruit stands and, along the way, a blowhole where water spurts up through a rock formation. Watch out for the free-range chickens.\nHiking Maui is crisscrossed by hiking trails, from easy strolls to strenuous climbs.\nSome trails pass through rain forests that have waterfalls and plunge pools for swimming. The trails at Haleakala Crater, a national park that requires a fee, takes hikers through a lunarlike landscape. There also are plenty of hikes near the coast. Or just start down the beach and see how far it takes you before turning back.\nMaui has songbirds that are found nowhere else in the world and a dazzling array of colorful tropical flowers.\nWhale watching Watching whales on Maui is seasonal, running from November to May, when humpback whales fill the waters between the southern shores and the islands of Molokai and Lanai.\nPaying to ride in a charter boat will get you closer to the whales, but they are easily visible from the shore as they leap or raise their enormous tails out of the water.\nFood Maui is known for five-star restaurants, but there are also plenty of inexpensive, often hole-in-the-wall choices.\nThe Kihei Caffe has a nice mix of American and Hawaiian breakfast food. Taqueria Cruz has tasty seafood tacos on its menu. Lahaina has several good-and-cheap options, including Ono Tacos, CJ’s Deli and Diner, and Star Noodle.\nLodging Hotels in Maui can be expensive; many start at $300 nightly and go much, much higher.\nThere are a few properties that are clean and have reasonable rates, including Kaanapali Beach Hotel, Maui Coast Hotel in Kihei and Napili Kai Beach Resort.\nAnother option is to rent a condo. Those may cost a little more, but you will save money in other areas. Most of the condos have kitchens, so you can cook and save on eating out. A condo with a washing machine even means packing less to save on luggage fees.\nThe Associated Press\nWhen you go Maui travel information: gohawaii.com/en/maui .", "external_links": ["http://gohawaii.com/en/maui"], "published": "2015-07-19T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:23:50.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
