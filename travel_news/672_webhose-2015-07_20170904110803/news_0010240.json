Slightly off the beaten track, between Split and Dubrovnik, this little town boasts a stunning setting of steep mountains only meters away from the brilliant blue Mediterranean sea. \nWe visited the still very untouched area of the Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park on a recent trip to Vietnam. While not originally in our trip plans, the few people who had been absolutely raved about the place, we decided to go and it did not disappoint. We did a 2 day hike of the Tu Lan Cave system which is where I snapped this photo. It is a phenomenal place where we got to camp out in hammocks in the jungle. I could not recommend it enough! \nI travelled around South America with a friend and took this photo while in the Amazon, in Ecuador. This was a big lagoon where we went too for a swim, then waited for the sun to go down to go searching for snakes. The time in the jungle was such a unique experience and this is one of my favourite photos. \nAfter travelling through the Outer Hebrides by campervan, my wife and I decided to spend a night on our return to the Scottish Mainland on the small island of Luing, south of Oban. At 3 am I looked out of the window and saw this view of Toberonochy, which had once a thriving slate industry. A beautiful village in the Argyll, Bute area of Scotland. \nStanding on Trolltunga in Norway after a hail storm. \nMy lovely wife Sharyn Corbett on our last day of our first time on a cruise ship - the Pacific Pearl \nA woman tourist takes time out to contemplate her surroundings in Chateau Chaumont-sur-Loire, France. \nA woman in white attends to monks and worshipers at a Bali temple \nWe had lunch at this resort in Cebu after whale shark watching. The beach was lovely - with white sand and clear water. \nMt Yasur, Vanuatu. « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nThis week's travel photo entries take us from the coast of Croatia to Vietnam's caves... and feature everything from spectacular sunsets to a hailstorm. \nDo you have a holiday snap that you'd like to share with the world? \nSend it to us and be in to win a Panasonic camera!
