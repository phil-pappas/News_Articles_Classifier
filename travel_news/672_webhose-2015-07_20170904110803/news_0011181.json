The photos prompted the hashtag ' #CeciltheLion ', where social media activists are rallying against hunting tourism, and calling for action. The hunter, who is a dentist from Minneapolis, has also had to close down his practice as activists have gone offline and are protesting against his actions at his front door.US president, Barak Obama is calling for the US to build the world's fastest computer by 2025 . The supercomputer would be 20 times quicker than the current leading machine, which is in China. The Americans had better work fast however as, with the current rate that technology is expanding and diversifying, 10 years is a long time in 'tech years'. And finally, we've all dreamt of packing it in, quitting our 9-5 and travelling world, but very few people ever do. Walter Change did just this and embarked on an incredible three-year, 60-country adventure. Lucky for us he captured it all on video and created a short film which is sure to take your wanderlust up a few notches. \nFriday, July 31, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T19:57:36.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
