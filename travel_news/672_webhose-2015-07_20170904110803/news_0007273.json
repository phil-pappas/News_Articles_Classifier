Delta and United have already warned their PRASM numbers would fall as well. \n\"International pricing remains under pressure as a consequence of lower international fuel surcharges along weak demand,\" said Deutsche Bank Research, adding that weak currencies relative to the dollar and oversupply in overseas markets are also to blame.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T23:42:18.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
