Seventy-Six iconic NT barramundi, or “barra” as the locals refer to them, will be expertly tagged and released throughout Top End waters, home to the best barramundi habitat in Australia. Although only one fish will be tagged as the million dollar fish, the seventy-five others will net their catchers $10,000 each. The season for catching the million dollar fish will end February 2016. \nAustralia’s Northern Territory is an unrivaled fishing destination. The modern city of Darwin is the hub of all fishing activity, with easy access to the best fishing spots, whether on tidal rivers, scenic inland billabongs, mangrove-lined estuaries or along the picturesque coastline. \nAnd it’s a great place to stay and explore the Outback! Immerse yourself in vast, pristine national parks, swim in natural waterfalls, and discover ancient Aboriginal rock art sites. This is truly Crocodile Dundee country! \nTips on hooking a barra in Australia’s Outback: \n- During the build-up season (October-November), hit the inland waterways and billabongs for freshwater barramundi as they warm up there ahead of monsoon season. \n- From January, as the rivers swell and the estuaries merge with floodplains, the run-off begins – the prime barra time is around February. Barra hotspots are as close as Darwin Harbor, where you’ll find them hiding in the mangroves, creeks and estuaries. \n- Local professional fishing guides will give you the insider’s tips, and they’ll share their secret spots. But best of all, you won’t need to bring a thing as they provide all the necessary equipment – specialist rods, reels and an array of live bait and lure options that will simply amaze you. \nTo learn more about the Million Dollar Fish, please visit milliondollarfish.com.au . \nTo find out more about Australia’s Outback Northern Territory, visit australiasoutback.com or contact Hallie Rosenbloom Hallie@myriadmarketing.com \n*$1 million Australian dollars is equivalent to approximately $750,000 USD. $10,000 Australian dollars is equivalent to approximately $7,500 USD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T21:44:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
