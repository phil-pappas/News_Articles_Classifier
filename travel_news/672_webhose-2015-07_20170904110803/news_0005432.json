This campervan has its very own garden growing on the back. \nFreedom campers at Wynyard Quarter are on notice after turning the waterfront spot into a makeshift campground. \nAuckland Council is cracking down on the problem due to concerns about campers dumping human waste and cooking with open flames next to large storage tanks containing flammable substances. \nThe area has become a \"hotspot\" for freedom campers with up to 50 vehicles a night parked up during peak times, Auckland Council licensing and compliance services general manager Grant Barnes says. JESS LEE/FAIRFAX NZ \nHerne Bay's Pt Erin Park was overrun with freedom campers until overnight parking restrictions were put in place in May. \n\"Our focus is not on the vulnerable people who are down there by necessity. We are of the view that there are people who camp down there by choice and in doing so they are in breach of council bylaws.\" \nAuckland Transport began handing out flyers to tourists camping in the area warning them of the restrictions and encouraging them to move on last week. \nBarnes says freedom camping is a long-standing issue at Wynyard Quarter. \nA similar crackdown 18 months ago saw numbers decline significantly, he says. \n\"We've seen numbers increase over the last 18 months to the point now where we are again concerned for the wellbeing of both the campers and the general public.\" \nThe council will maintain a presence in the area this time to make sure the message gets through, Barnes says. \nAuckland Transport compliance officers will be in the area from July 20. Ad Feedback \nBreach of bylaw notices will be issued to people camping on streets and those not complying may be issued a trespass notice. \nHerne Bay's Pt Erin Park was overrun with freedom campers until overnight parking restrictions were put in place in May. \nAuckland Transport spokesman Mark Hannan says the council has received complaints about overnight campers at the car park for many years. \nSix tickets have been issued to people flouting the new rules since May 11, three of these were to suspected campers. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:34:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
