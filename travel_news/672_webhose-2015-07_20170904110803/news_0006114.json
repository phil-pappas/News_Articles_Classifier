Divers will particularly enjoy the Breathtaking Cruise from Maumere to Ambon, which passes through some of Indonesia’s top dive sites; nature lovers are catered for with the Gili, Satonda & Komodo cruise, which takes in some stunning coral reefs and national parks; photographers will appreciate the spectacular scenery on the Raja Ampat Archipelago cruise; and history and anthropology buffs will find the Historic Maluku Islands route absolutely fascinating.\nSetting the standard for the premium travel vacation, all of Remote Lands’ itineraries offer a five-star experience, with guests sailing on private luxury schooners, designed in traditional Indonesian style and featuring all the latest luxury facilities and amenities. Guests are served by their own private crew including chefs and diving instructors, and all boats come with diving equipment. Remote Lands will also be working with longtime partners Aman, set to launch the new Amandira boat, which will join their existing Amanikan vessel to offer the ultimate in sailing luxury.\n“Indonesia’s huge number and variety of islands make it the perfect country for sailing,” says Jay Tindall, Remote Lands’ co-founder and COO. “The islands offer a hugely diverse range of landscapes, from arid volcanoes to lush jungle, and are home to some incredible wildlife – especially the famous Komodo Dragon.”\nTindall’s co-founder Catherine Heald is equally enthusiastic about the company’s Indonesia cruise products. “With so many islands, logistics are a big issue for travelers to Indonesia,” she said. “Scheduled flights are inconvenient and driving is impractical, so island hopping, maybe with some private jet flights included, is the ideal way to see as much of the country as possible.”\nRelated Posts Amawaterways Introduces More Opportunities dor Solo Travelers Helsingborg Launches Destiantion Video Windstar Cruises Announces 2015 Winter Voyage Collection New VisitScotland data reveals regional visitor trends for 2012 TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T13:57:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
