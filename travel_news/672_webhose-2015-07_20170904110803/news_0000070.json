These giants of the sea are a strong symbol, a tribute to nature and living heritage that are undeniably one of the wonders of Reunion Island, and year after year, they are seen by more and more visitors who come to the island to witness this amazing spectacle. \nEvery year during the southern winter season and especially from June to September, humpback whales coming from the Atlantic seek out the warmer waters of the Indian Ocean to mate and calve. The first of the whales seen this year have settled on the west coast of the island and specifically in the Bay of Saint-Leu. \nComing across these majestic mammals in their natural environment is always a unique and privileged moment and a must-see for tourists coming to the island. Conservationists and professionals are taking a long-term approach to whale watching to ensure that this unique spectacle can be preserved for generations to come. To accomplish this, the authorities have set up regulations as to how to approach the whales and launched the OÂ²CR label (Observation Certified Manager of Cetaceans in Reunion). \nFor followers of such enjoyable and almost effortless outdoor activities, French tour operator Exotismes launched offers for an ecotourism trip to come to Reunion Island and watch the humpback whales. This is a great opportunity for tourists to increase their knowledge of the environment and issues related to protection of marine life.
