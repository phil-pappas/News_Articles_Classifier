(AP) - Power has been restored to most customers as some New Hampshire towns continue to clean up from a strong storm over the weekend.\nSunday's storm caused up to 20,000 outages. That was down to a handful on Tuesday morning, mostly in New London, Sunapee, Newport and Newbury.\nStreets were closed due to downed power lines and trees. In Claremont, a tree fell on a car, killing the driver.\nIn Newport, which received high winds, heavy rain and quarter-size hail, authorities said the Hilltop Motel was believed to have been struck by lightning. About 15 homes and six cars suffered tree damage.\nPolice Chief Jim Burroughs estimated the Emergency Communications Center received between 500 and 600 calls during the storm, some of them roll-over calls from Claremont and New London.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
