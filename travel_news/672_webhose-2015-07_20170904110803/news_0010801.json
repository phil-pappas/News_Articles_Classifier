Most of the banks we rated are in the Bs. I would say it's a very solid bank.\"\nThe holding company formerly known as Center Bancorp, which did not respond to a request for comment, said in its Tuesday news release that it will use the new funds to redeem the $11.25 million in preferred stock it issued in 2011 to the Treasury under the Small Business Lending Fund Program, which is part of the Small Business Jobs Act signed into law by President Obama in September 2010.\nConnectOne Bancorp is one of more than half a dozen New Jersey financial companies that took the government up on an offer to convert their Troubled Asset Relief Program funding into the small-business lending program. The shift potentially reduced the interest rates they had to pay to the government, depending on whether they met small-business lending goals.\nBut the benefits are temporary. According to program guidelines, the rate paid by participating banks to the government will rise from as low as 1 percent a year to 9 percent after 4 1/2 years.\nOtherwise, the $50 million raised by ConnectOne will be used for \"general corporate purposes, including but not limited to contributing capital to the bank and to fund future growth.\"\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. were the joint-placement agents for the offering.\nEmail: newman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T14:17:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
