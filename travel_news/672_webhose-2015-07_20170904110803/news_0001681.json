Nor are travelers deterred by the recent Department of Justice announcement that it is launching an investigation into possible collusion in the airline industry. And the hotel industry is set to do well , despite Airbnb and other industry disruptors. \nSpending on travel and tourism increased in the first quarter of 2015 reported the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite the anemic growth in the economy in the same period. Historically, the hospitality industry, despite its pronounced cyclical behavior, manages to grow on par with the economy long term. \nSo, what are the best hotels, resorts, and cruise lines investors should be buying? Here are the top four, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nMust Read: 4 Stocks Winning from U.S. Soccer Sponsorships \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points.

Interval Leisure Group, Inc. ( IILG - Get Report ) Rating: Buy, B+ Market Cap: $1.3 billion Year-to-date return: 6.9% \nInterval Leisure Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, provides lodging and leisure services to the vacation industry in the United States, Europe, and internationally. The company operates through two segments, Exchange and Rental, and Vacation Ownership. \n\"We rate INTERVAL LEISURE GROUP (IILG) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, reasonable valuation levels, increase in net income, good cash flow from operations and increase in stock price during the past year. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 7.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 17.5%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure industry. The net income increased by 6.5% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $23.72 million to $25.26 million. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 89.99% to $64.71 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, INTERVAL LEISURE GROUP has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -11.01%. After a year of stock price fluctuations, the net result is that IILG's price has not changed very much. Although its weak earnings growth may have played a role in this flat result, don't lose sight of the fact that the performance of the overall market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, was essentially similar. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year.
