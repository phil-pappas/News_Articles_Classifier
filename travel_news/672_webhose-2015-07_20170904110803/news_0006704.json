The figures also showed that the gap between state and independent progression rates to the most selective institutions has widened in recent years. In 2008/09 the gap was 37 percentage points, but it was up to 40 percentage points for the 2012/13 cohort. Those figures came a day before the body that regulates access to higher education - OFFA - released its access agreements for the next academic year, which set out what institutions must do to try and improve the chances of students from the poorest backgrounds excelling at university or college. So, while OFFA pointed out that significant and sustained efforts have been made in the area of fair access over the last decade, these statistics demonstrate that progress in widening access and participation in higher education has been both small and slow. OFFA and the government now want to increase the participation rate by students from the most disadvantaged areas from 16.1 per cent at present to 36 per cent by the end of the decade, something the University and College Union (UCU) welcomes. We do, however, have concerns about how it will be met. OFFA’s report said it had to send over half - 103 out of 183 – of the responses submitted by institutions on time back to the drawing board because the targets they had set themselves or the spending they had earmarked to help poorer students were not considered ambitious enough. Last year, just 33 institutions were challenged in this way. The university application process has not faced sufficient scrutiny If we are to meet this important target we will need to see bold reform in addition to these efforts. I am worried that the detail of agreements suggests that we may not be doing quite enough to meet the widening access target. My chief concerns are: • Just a sixth of institutions focussed on part-time students – this, despite a worrying 40 per cent drop in the number of students studying part time since 2010-11. • Only two-fifths of institutions set targets around specific ethnic groups – a small proportion given that ethnic group participation rates vary so widely. Representation of different ethnic groups varies between institutions, subjects, geographic regions, and courses. • Around a third of institutions set targets in relation to disabled students – but the Government is consulting on changes to the Disabled Students’ Allowance which currently supports 7 per cent of students. • A quarter of institutions did not set targets to address retention measures for students from poorer backgrounds, despite the Government relaxing the numbers of students who can go to university. At UCU we believe the key area that has not faced sufficient scrutiny is the university application process. Last month, UCU published a report based on a survey of our members working within the university application process . \"[Our members] backed a complete overhaul of the current system and the introduction of one where students apply to university after they receive their results\" Their concerns were extensive: inaccurate predicted grades; misuse of unconditional offers; concerns about the reliability and validity of the personal statement; inconsistent understanding and consideration of data; and despair about the chaotic Clearing process. They backed a complete overhaul of the current system and the introduction of one where students apply to university after they receive their results. These radical plans are also backed by leading social commentator Danny Dorling and the current and former heads of OFFA. We believe a suite of reforms in the application and admission process could serve as a significant step forward towards the government and OFFA’s bold targets to improve the diversity on our campuses.
