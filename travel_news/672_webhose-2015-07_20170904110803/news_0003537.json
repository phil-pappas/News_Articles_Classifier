We still have that incredible destination, we just fell off the radar. \n“We want to find those additional travellers that are flying eight or nine hours to Dubai when they could be in Bermuda in five hours.” \nHanbury added between 20,000 and 25,000 British tourists visited the island in 2014, about 10% of the entire tourist number for the year, with the US being the largest source market. \nAs well as finding new partners, Hanbury said the authority has set aside up to $3.8 million in marketing spend for the next two and a half years to promote the destination, with up to 20% earmarked for the UK. He said money would be spent on PR and social media. \nHe is hoping the 35th America’s Cup will help secure Bermuda in the minds of the British public as a British team, Land Rover BAR, which is captained by Sir Ben Ainslie, is entering the race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:36:07.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
