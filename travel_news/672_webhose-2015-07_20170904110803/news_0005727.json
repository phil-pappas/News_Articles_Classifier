Norton worked as a correspondent and producer for Reuters, then went on to AOL, and has been involved in several successful online businesses. As a writer, Norton has contributed to The European and the Financial Times, and he was even the press officer for world heavyweight champion boxer Lennox Lewis. More recently, he cofounded and served as the CEO of Sedition Art and Saatchi Online. His newest venture is a contemporary-art project space, Norton Gallery . Its inaugural show features work from Sam Falls, Amanda Ross-Ho, Stephen G. Rhodes, Bryan Dooley, Paul Gillis, Graham Wilson, and Serge Attukwei Clottey. Norton Gallery is located in the Hollywood Hills…in Norton’s garage. Visiting the gallery is by appointment only; you just let yourself in (with a code provided by Norton). You then view the art on your own time, with no distractions. The non-traditional setting is fun, but it doesn’t take away from the work and it illustrates Norton’s clever entrepreneurial spirit. If you ask me, it’s genius.\nCJ Heyliger’s work opens at Norton Gallery in mid-September.\nNorton Gallery\n946 Tuxedo Terrace\nLos Angeles\nBy appointment only: contact@nortongallery.com\nPhoto: Courtesy of Norton Gallery", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php", "http://www.nortongallery.com/"], "published": "2015-07-08T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:52:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
