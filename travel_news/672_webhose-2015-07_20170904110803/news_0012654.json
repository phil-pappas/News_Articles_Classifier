Pew's research team tackled this assertion and asked the general public about specific characteristics needed to be successful in political and business leadership positions (i.e. working out compromises, being honest & ethical, negotiating profitable deals, etc.). In 8 of the 9 categories assessed, results indicated that there was no difference between male and females in demonstrating those competencies, or, in some cases women were perceived as being better at demonstrating those characteristics than their male counterparts. Of the characteristics surveyed , the only competency that women scored less effective in was being willing to take risks. \nSo what is holding women back from leadership positions? According to a 2015 Pew Research study , the top reasons women are perceived to not be in leadership positions: • 43% of Americans (both men and women) believe women are held to higher standards, • 43% feel that America is not ready to hire/elect female leaders and, • 23% believe family responsibilities do not allow for enough time to be successful in these roles. \nWhile conversations on the issue are starting to elevate (looking at you Meryl Streep and Hilary Clinton), perhaps the reason no one wants to talk about the \"woman issue\" is because the problem is so deep and so entrenched that organizations -- and even governments -- feel helpless to do anything in order to make progress. \nSo just how can organizations help address this deeply rooted problem? They need to get more qualified females into leadership positions to bring their mindset, ideas, and perspectives into governance and policy making to ensure decisions are made and policies built considering all perspectives. But how does an organization determine the quality of its female leadership pipeline? \nIn this two-part series, we will explore how to look at your People Dimension -- environment, culture, development and rewards. First, let's look at the environment. \nEnvironment \nThe environment can be thought of as the magnet for organizations -- the thing that draws people to their organization and keeps them there. The environment is why people show up. This goes beyond pool tables in the lobby and decadent lunches served to employees for free, and really gets at what matters most to individuals within the organization. \nAs of the first quarter in 2015, the Millennials make up a majority of the U.S. workforce. And these Millennial women in the workforce have very specific ideas about what they are looking for in an organization. This generation puts a huge emphasis on work-life balance. Some organizations have heeded this change by making drastic changes. For instance -- migrating to a virtual work environment. For virtual organizations with women in their childbearing and rearing years, it allows women who have children to be both an employee and a mother. They have the flexibility to be both, and while minimizing an impact on both their home life and careers. \nUnderstanding this option does not work for all organizations or industries, there are other environmental options to explore. Consider the floor plan or layout of your facility. Many leaders have closed \"window\" type offices open cubicles located near one another around the periphery of the building, with lower levels of leadership and staff in cubicles in the middle. If women are making up a minority of the leadership (meaning they are not physically located near leaders), they are literally separated from the key decision makers and conversations about these decisions. The bifurcation speaks volumes in the physical layout of the space. Does your organization create a layout that invites the opportunity for an elevated conversation among underrepresented groups? \nStay tuned for the next post where we look at the People Dimension of culture, development, and rewards. \nSheila Repeta is a Senior Consultant at FutureSense, Inc.
