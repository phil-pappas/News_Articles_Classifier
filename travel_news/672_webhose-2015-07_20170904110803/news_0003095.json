As much as it is important, we cannot afford to lose lives over this ritual. The importance of life is greater than the importance of the ritual.”\nMost deaths occurred in unregistered initiation schools, with some boys abducted and forced to undergo the ritual.\nIn June, South African police rescued 11 teenage boys from forced circumcision after their parents reported that they had been taken from the street to participate in the initiation.\nThis year, the government shut down over 150 unregistered schools, including one in township of Soweto outside Johannesburg.\nParents have been encouraged to pursue criminal cases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:05:25.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
