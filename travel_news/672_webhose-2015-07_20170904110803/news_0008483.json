Earlier this year, the department required trains carrying dangerous goods to slow their speeds when travelling in highly urbanized areas. \n\"Transport Canada issued an emergency directive to this end which remains in effect until August 17, 2015.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:30:52.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
