It’s about taking time out, relaxing and then hopefully getting her energy and focus back to returns to the game stronger than ever.” \nKuoni has offered seven nights in the Caribbean for Laura plus travelling companion and will cover flights, hotel and expenses for a week at a time to suit her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:04:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
