But when the world’s toughest sporting event unveils its 102nd edition on July 4, it will do so – with all apologies to the Yorkshire lanes that framed the race so enthusiastically last summer – in what might be viewed as its spiritual heartland. For if France is the place that provides cycling’s hardest challenges, Holland is where it is most appreciated, a nation in love with travelling on two wheels. True, the flatness of the land helps. A country where the highest point “rises” to just 1,060ft (323 metres) will always be suitable for cyclists. Yet there is something more to the Dutch affection for propulsion by pedal. It is a way of life. “Amsterdam is wonderful for cycling, because the city offers an enormous, dedicated infrastructure,” says Pete Jordan, author of In the City of Bikes: The Story of the Amsterdam Cyclist (£9.99; cityofbikes.com ). “Virtually every street can be cycled, as nearly every major artery has separated bike paths, which make pedalling anywhere in the city a breeze. Amsterdam is a city of cyclists Photo: AP/FOTOLIA “It’s the same beyond Amsterdam. A dense network of bike routes criss-crosses the Netherlands. You don’t need to be a hardcore rider on a high-end bike to enjoy cycling in Holland. Because such a large proportion of the population rides regularly it’s easy to jump on to any old bike and fit right in.” Holland is highly accessible. Stena Line ( stenaline.co.uk ) offers daily car ferry crossings (maximum frequency twice daily) from Harwich to the Hook of Holland. DFDS Seaways ( dfdsseaways.co.uk ) runs once-a-day services from Newcastle to Amsterdam. The Hull-Rotterdam route is served once-daily by P&O ( poferries.com ). British Airways ( ba.com ), KLM ( klm.com ), easyJet ( easyJet.com ), Flybe ( flybe.com ) and Jet2 ( jet2.com ) serve Amsterdam Schiphol from across the UK. You can also book rail journeys to Amsterdam (including Eurostar trains to Brussels) from London St Pancras via NS International ( nsinternational.nl ), and onward tickets through the Dutch operator’s domestic arm ( ns.nl ). 1. Meander around the metropolis Amsterdam is the symbol of Holland’s alliance with the bicycle, a city where 400,000 cyclists whirr around the streets, making use of 250 miles of cycle lanes. Touring it from the saddle adds charm to any weekend break, whether you sample the broad canvas of culture at the Rijksmuseum (0031 20 674 7000; rijksmuseum.nl ; €17.50/£12.50) or the special emphasis of the Van Gogh Museum (20 570 5200; vangoghmuseum.nl ; €17/£12.10). The capital’s two-wheeled infatuation extends to accommodation. The Bicycle Hotel (Van Ostadestraat 123; 20 679 3452; bicyclehotel.com ) is a bolt-hole aimed at younger visitors in the Nieuwe Pijp district, offering double rooms with breakfast from €30 (£21.50) and bike hire for €8 (£6) a day. The five-star Grand Hotel Amrath (Prins Hendrikkade 108; 20 552 0000; amrathamsterdam.com ) has a “Hermitage” package that, as well as tickets to the Amsterdam offshoot of the Russian gallery and a double room with breakfast, includes bicycle hire for the day. From €309 (£220) a night (for two sharing) in July. • Amsterdam city guide • The best hotels in Amsterdam • Top 10: budget hotels in Amsterdam 2. The city where the cycle is king If Amsterdam adores the bicycle, northerly Groningen is obsessed. It has been described as “the world’s most bike-friendly city” thanks to a 1977 urban redesign that all but barred cars from the centre. Residents roll around a cycle-path maze of such density that there are 10,000 bike parking slots at the railway station alone. You can hire your own ride and dip into an enclave of medieval heritage where the Groninger Museum (50 366 6555; groningermuseum.nl ; €13/£9) adds a bright burst of modern art (not least Philippe Starck’s silver cylindrical building). The NH Hotel De Ville (Oude Boteringerstraat 43-45; 50 3181222; nh-hotels.com ) has doubles for €76/£54 (room only) and bikes to rent. A windmill near Groningen Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 3. Follow in famous tyre tracks The idea of tackling a stage of the Tour de France conjures images of Alpine slopes. But Utrecht’s 2015 curtain-raiser is a short time trial that can be re-enacted without pain or difficulty. The nine-mile dash starts on Truus van Lierlaan in Transwijk-Noord and ends on Croeselaan avenue ( letour.com/le-tour/2015/us/stage-1.html ). Afterwards, explore the fourth-biggest Dutch city (25 miles south east of Amsterdam). Bars and eating places flank the Oudegracht canal, while the Centraal Museum (30 236 2362; centraalmuseum.nl; €11/£8) showcases the likes of 17th-century Dutch master Joachim Wtewael. The Grand Hotel Karel V (Geertebolwerk 1; 30 2337555; karelv.nl ) offers one night’s half board, with bike hire, for €115 (£82) a head (two sharing). • Rembrandt in Holland: getting a full picture of the Dutch Master 4. Wander Zeeland’s soft edges The photogenic flatness of the Dutch landscape comes alive in Zeeland, the most south-westerly province where the Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt rivers meet the sea. Its 400-mile coastline has cycle paths through towns such as Cadzand, Oostkapelle and Westkapelle. Dutch Bike Tours (24 324 4712; dutchbiketours.com ) offers “Dunes and Deltaworks”, a self-guided tour that traces the region over six days, from €509 (£360) a head (two sharing), including hotels with breakfast, bikes and luggage transfer, but no flights.

Sample two slices of Holland The Dutch are as famous for cheese as for cycling, and a flavoursome tour by Inntravel (01653 617 003; inntravel.co.uk ) unites the themes. The self-guided “Dutch Discovery: Edam, Amsterdam and Gouda” comprises five days on country roads, starting in the red-wax city of Edam, 15 miles north east of Amsterdam, and cutting through the capital, via leafy pockets such as Beatrixpark and Amstelpark, to yellow-wax Gouda (40 miles south) in time for the Thursday cheese market on Markt square. This 120-mile trip is priced from £715 a head (two sharing), including accommodation with breakfast, baggage transfer, maps and bike hire (or from £992 a head with train travel from the UK). • The best books about Holland 6. Seek a chilly legend of the North Devotees of Dutch tradition go misty-eyed at mention of the Elfstedentocht, a 120-mile skating contest that rushes between 11 towns in the northerly province of Friesland, starting and ending in Leeuwarden and veering along frozen canals. Sadly, winter has been too weak of late, and the event has not been held since 1997, but you can cycle its route in eight days via the self-guided “Eleven Cities of Friesland” tour sold by Wheel2Wheel (0800 731 1631; wheel2wheelholidays.com ). Covering 180 miles in all, the tour costs from £489 a head (two sharing), including hotel accommodation with breakfast, bag transfer and bike, but no flights. 7. Forge forward as a family Free from troublesome gradients, Holland is the perfect choice for family escapes by pedal power. Saddle Skedaddle (0191 265 1110; skedaddle.co.uk ) runs a regular “Windmills & Golden Beaches” group excursion specifically aimed at travellers with children. It takes eight days to progress through North Holland, the peninsula and province that juts out above Amsterdam, ticking off the coastal hotspot of Hoorn, the port of Den Helder and Texel island, with its windswept dunes. Prices start at £715 per adult (£865 with flights), including full-board lodging on cosy barges (adult bikes £80 extra; child bikes £60). Places are available on trips scheduled for July 18 and August 15. The port of Den Helder Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 8. Loiter longer around the lake For those who want to espy the Dutch countryside in depth, Macs Adventure (0141 530 4393; macsadventure.com ) does a “Grand Tour of Holland”. This takes eight days to circle the colossal IJsselmeer “lake” which wells up in the north west of the country. A 250-mile self-guided odyssey, beginning and finishing in Amsterdam, it arcs through North Holland, taking the 21-mile Afsluitdijk causeway across the IJsselmeer, before flitting south through Friesland towns including Lemmer and into the marshes of Weerribben-Wieden National Park in the province of Overijssel. The holiday costs from £720 a head (two sharing), including hotel accommodation with breakfast and bag transfers (no flights; bike hire is available, at an extra cost). 9. Combine wheels and water If long days on the road are too much for your junior charges, the “Family Special: IJssel Lake” offered by Freedom Treks (01273 224 066; freedomtreks.co.uk ) may appeal. This seven-night group journey takes a clockwise route in and out of Amsterdam, venturing across and around the IJsselmeer by boat and bike. Designed for families with children aged between seven and 11, the itinerary builds in plenty of stops for ice cream and paddling, and ticks off the Walibi World theme park in Biddinghuizen. E-bikes are an optional extra at £120 a head for easily tired legs. A departure in July for a family of four costs £1,455 in total, including bicycles and full‑board barge accommodation (no flights). • Holland river cruise guide 10. Wait to wheel through spring While Holland is cycling heaven in summer, it can be just as alluring in spring, especially at the celebrated Keukenhof flower garden in Lisse, where seven million bulbs push up through 79 manicured acres every March, April and May. HF Holidays (0345 470 8558; hfholidays.co.uk ) runs a “Tulip Tour”, a four-day cycle jaunt that visits this blaze of colour (as well as Leiden, Rembrandt’s birthplace), but some of the distance is covered on a genteel canal-barge cruise. Prices start at £370 per person (with two sharing), including full-board lodging and bike hire, but not including transportation to nearby Amsterdam.
