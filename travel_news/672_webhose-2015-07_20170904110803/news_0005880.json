Jeremy Hunt will tell the British Medical Association to \"get real\" as he announces plans to remove an \"opt out\" from doctors' contracts which means they do not have to work on a Saturday or Sunday. He will accuse the doctors' trade union of acting as a \"road block to reforms that will save lives\", warning that it must be \"in no doubt\" that the government will enforce the changes if they refuse to negotiate. The plans triggered a furious response from the British Medical Association , which accused Mr Hunt of a \"wholesale attack\" on doctors. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary David Cameron put plans for a seven day NHS at the heart of the Conservative manifesto, describing improving the health service as his \"life's work\". He has repeatedly raised concerns that patients are up to 15 per cent more likely to die if they are admitted to hospital on a Sunday compared to a Wednesday because of the poorer service at weekends. Under their present system, a consultant with average earnings of £118,000 can boost their basic pay by a third by waiving their opt out and choosing to work at weekends. Some earn more than £200 an hour.Consultants are the only health service workers still entitled to opt out of working at the weekend. In a speech at the King's Fund health think tank in London, Mr Hunt is expected to say: “Around 6,000 people lose their lives every year because we do not have a proper 7 day service in hospitals. \"No one could possibly say that this was a system built around the needs of patients - and yet when I pointed this out to the BMA they told me to ‘get real.’ I simply say to the doctors union that I can give them 6,000 reasons why they, not I, need to ‘get real.’ “They are not remotely in touch with what their members actually believe. I have yet to meet a consultant who would be happy for their own family to be admitted at weekends or would not prefer to get test results back more quickly for their own patients. \"I will not allow the BMA to be a road block to reforms that will save lives.\" Mr Hunt's reforms will represent the first change to consultants contracts for more than a decade. The last changes were made under Labour in 2003, in a deal which has since been criticised for being overly generous. Under the deal consultants pay has risen by up to 50 per cent, while they also secured the opt out which entitles them to charge \"premium\" fees for working at weekends. MPs have condemned the deal as poor value for money and said that it is \"nonsensical\" that doctors can refuse to work in the evening and at weekends under the contracts. Under the system, the majority of doctors receive annual pensionable bonuses of up to £75,000, on top of their basic pay. The government is planning to overhaul the bonus system so that it is more transparent and rewards genuine excellence. Ministers will give the British Medical Association six weeks to decide whether to negotiate on the changes to the contract. If it refuses to do so it will impose the new terms on doctors by April 2017. Mr Hunt added: \"We also recognise that even as the principles we seek to defend do not change, the world in which they operate has changed. Technology, an ageing population and higher consumer expectations make the world of 2015 dramatically different to the world of 1948. “The true party of the NHS faces up to those changes with the same energy shown by those who conceived and founded it nearly 70 years ago.\" Dr Mark Porter, the head of the British Medical Association, said: “Doctors support more seven-day hospital services and have repeatedly called on the government to outline how they will fund and staff them. \"Despite whatever the health secretary may claim, his simplistic approach ignores the fact that this is a much broader issue than just doctors’ contracts. “Today’s announcement is nothing more than a wholesale attack on doctors to mask the fact that for two years the government has failed to outline any concrete proposals for introducing more seven-day hospital services.\" Dr Porter accused Mr Hunt of \"setting artificial deadlines\" and attacking doctors who were trying to do their best for patients. He said: “This is a blatant attempt by the government to distract from its refusal to invest properly in emergency care. So, I say again to the health secretary, get real and show us what you mean.\" Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T02:54:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
