Here are key excerpts: \n\nFirst, let me understand your role. Does this mean Abacus is being rebranded as Sabre? \nMy appointment means Sabre takes this business and this region very seriously. It’s an incredible asset, an important acquisition, a region that is going to be the fastest-growing for a long time to come and probably, the biggest region for Sabre in time to come. \n\nSecondly, it means we will find the ideal combination of Abacus assets (like local knowledge) and the business, expertise and product innovation we have globally at Sabre. How that translates to products, brands, etc, is yet to be determined. I’m two hours into the job. \n\nYou won’t commit that Abacus will be rebranded as Sabre but would you say that’s a possibility? \nYes, it is a possibility. \n\nDoes that mean Hans Belle, Sabre vice president/general manager Asia-Pacific, will be made redundant? \nHe will continue. The business in Asia-Pacific was managed through the Abacus partnership and Robert (Bailey) did a large part of the job. With the full acquisition, the previous Abacus CEO job becomes broader in that it manages all Sabre travel network assets in Asia, including Abacus. \n\nIn our article, Sabre-rattling? , agencies who are your customers here are watching to see if the acquisition will ‘rock the boat’. Continuity is an issue. So my question to you is, will there be a lot of other changes? \nI understand those concerns, and my job and the team’s job over the next few months will be to address those concerns. \n\nThe best evidence of that not being a concern, though, is that Sabre has been providing the core technology and product to Abacus customers for the last 17 years. So the crux of the business – the system that agencies log on to everyday – is the Sabre system and that is not going to change. So it is an acquisition that is incredibly well-suited for a smooth transition and one where the customers will feel very little, if nothing, in the transition. \n\nNow, over time, we hope to make things better – in the products we can bring to Asia, the knowledge we can bring to the product development team at Sabre, and providing agencies and suppliers a much more global proposition. As you know, the regional travel agencies or the country-specific agencies are moving rapidly out of the geographies they are born in; Chinese agencies are moving out of China and competing in the rest of the world; Indian agencies are moving into the Middle East and other parts of the region, so having a business and set of products that allow them to compete beyond their immediate borders is of value and that is immediately possible now with Abacus becoming an integral part of Sabre. \n\nCan you give me a simple example why it is possible now? \nSabre’s involvement in the running of Abacus before the acquisition was via its seats around the Board of Directors’ table. Today, it’s every email, every call, every customer meeting (because of its full ownership). Now translate that into real-time decision-making and how that improves product development, customer service operations. Even though it’s a subtle change, it’s a material change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T10:41:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
