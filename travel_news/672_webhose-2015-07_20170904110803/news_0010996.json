It can be used as a flight check-in bag or for any mode of transport with an infant.\nFlightJoy has announced the launch of its Car Seat Travel Bag, which fits most brands of infant car seats, booster seats, and carriers. Made of a lightweight, durable nylon fabric, the check in bag is water resistant and sewn so its edges won't fray. Padded shoulder straps and a webbed carry handle are included for convenient lifting and travel.\nAlso included is a no-slide drawstring with an adjustable lock. This keeps the bag secure, tightly closed, and protects the car seat against dirt and moisture. The gate check bag weighs only 10.1 ounces, so is light, and its backpack style straps will not cut off circulation. It's also a manageable 34 x 18 x 18 inches.\nThe FlightJoy bag is machine washable too. Users can keep it clean as it can last for many years. The product is solely for use as a travel aid. It can present a hazard to babies if used in cribs, carriages, beds, or play pens, according to the company.\nBacked by a two-year warranty, the infant baby car seat travel bag is suited for travel via automobile or by airplane.
