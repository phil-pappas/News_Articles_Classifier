Remember the sound of old-fashioned typewriters? I am now recreating that satisfying noise with my wonderful new mechanical keyboard. It enables me to relive the joys of old-fashioned touch-typing without the ping of the carriage return or the bother of rolling in separate sheets of paper. At the same time it makes me feel like a real writer. My big black keyboard has separate, dished keys and a heavy, industrial look. But it is strictly modern as well and just plugs into my computer with a USB lead. For me, though, it is not just a funky new toy. It is also a medical treatment. For after 50 years of non-stop typing, I have developed severe Repetitive Strain Injury , an excruciatingly painful condition for which there is no cure. In vain I have tried pills, hot rubs, cold rubs, exercises and elastic therapeutic tape as used by injured athletes. I am convinced that my RSI is caused by years of attempting to type on flat computer keyboards and when I mentioned my condition to my technological advisor, grandson Arthur, he told me that I needed an ergonomic keyboard . • I pay my teenage grandson to be my IT consultant The Cherry MX Blue keyboard Ergo-what? Could you get such things? Arthur recommended the Cherry MX keyboard , explained how it worked and how it differed from the usual computer keyboards. \"I was researching gaming keyboards,\" he said, \"and found that mechanical keyboards are best for people who type a lot, as you know when you have pressed a key. They have an audible click, but you do not need to press the key all the way down, which makes it much easier on the fingers.\" \"These keyboards are more robust, more satisfying to use and less strenuous on the fingers and wrists than the regular ‘membrane’ keyboards, the sort you have used before. The Cherry is not actually designated ergonomic, but the fact that it’s mechanical means that it’s superior to regular keyboards.\" The Cherry MX Blue was first made in 2007 and has become the most popular model for people who, like myself, have to type for a living. The word ‘blue’ refers to the type of switch, and is the loudest one. Some switches on these mechanical keyboards are silent but the noise is all part of the pleasure of using it, for me at least. I love the sound the keyboard makes but I love even more the fact that using it has eased my RSI considerably. Thanks once again, Arthur! • Who are the happiest people in Europe? Making typos can be frustrating (Alamy) For touch typists of the old school like myself, there is also less risk of hitting the wrong keys or the keyboard suddenly deciding to go into capitals without warning. Even if you don’t suffer from RSI, the frustration of constantly hitting wrong keys can drive you insane after a few hours. In the old days, we were taught touch-typing to make the task easy and smooth and then electronic keyboards came along and frustrated our efforts. Mechanical keyboards will appeal to older people who like me have never really got used to the flat silent type. Specially designed ergonomic keyboards are available from the RSI shop , and they are mainly aimed at two-handed typists. There is also a range of ergonomic mice including a left-handed one. As a lefthander, maybe this will be my next purchase. • Hidden iPad features that could improve your life • How can I read text on my laptop more easily? Although there is no medical proof that these devices work to minimize RSI and they tend to be pooh-poohed by doctors, I can promise that they definitely do make a dramatic difference. They are fun to use as well, unlike the standard computer keyboards, which are all sleek style and murder on your hands and wrists. Novelty keyboards (USB Typewriter/Qwerky Toys) For those who like the idea of a novelty keyboard but who do not suffer from RSI, you can now get keyboards that look like a typewriter but which are actually electronic and are even in some cases, reconstructed from actual old typewriters. The three companies listed below are American, but the products can be ordered in the UK: • Hemingwrite • USB Typewriter • Qwerky Toys It’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that just as I was thinking I might have to do a Barbara Cartland and lie down on a sofa while I dictated my work – yes the RSI was that bad - the mechanical keyboard has come to my aid.
