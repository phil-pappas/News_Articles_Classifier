Sub Fest is a three-day celebration of the city's rich maritime history that includes the production of 28 submarines during World War II. Originally conceived as a submarine-related film festival, the concept grew to include music, art and activities in downtown Manitowoc. The festival's inaugural theme is World War II and it will feature a showing of the movie \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" introduced by actor Jim Bates from the film. Other activities include tours of the USS Cobia, a fleet submarine moored in Manitowoc similar to the subs produced in that city for the war, a submarine-inspired art exhibit and, well, a sub-eating contest. Events will take place at the Capitol Civic Centre, Wisconsin Maritime Museum and Rahr-West Art Museum. Those organizations joined with the Manitowoc County Historical Society and the Manitowoc Area Visitor and Convention Bureau to put on the event. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox?
