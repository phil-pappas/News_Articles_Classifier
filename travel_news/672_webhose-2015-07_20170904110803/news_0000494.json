The pair were on a Thomas Cook holiday with their family when they died from carbon monoxide poisoning. \nCreagh said that solicitors acting for Green had sent a letter at 4.57am in a bid to deter her from raising the issue in parliament. \n“This letter was clearly designed to silence me and to have a chilling effect on me speaking out about the behaviour of Thomas Cook,” Creagh said in the Mail on Sunday . \n“They may claim it was only intended to clarify and put me in full possession of the facts as Harriet Green saw them. But sending an MP a solicitor’s letter at 5am is hardly the way to do that.” \nGreen however denied the accusation. \n“It is a misrepresentation to suggest the letter tried to silence this MP who is, and always has been, free to choose to be factual or not. Anyone who reads the letter will see that it does not seek to do what she claims,” a spokesperson said. \n“Harriet fully supports public debate on the serious issue of carbon monoxide, which is why she has donated a significant amount of her own money to help this crucial cause, despite not having joined Thomas Cook until six years after the tragedy took place.” \nGreen has agreed to give a third of her £5.7 million to charitable causes. \nIn May the jury at the inquest into the deaths found that Thomas Cook had “breached its duty of care”. Readers' comments (1) PETER MAYNE | Mon, 13 Jul 2015 12:33 pm \nHarriet Green is 100% innocent in this matter. When this very sad incident occurred we now all realise that Cook's management was the most incompetent in travel history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T01:44:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
