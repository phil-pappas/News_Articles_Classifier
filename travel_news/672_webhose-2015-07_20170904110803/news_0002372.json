Scott Taylor, Chief Executive of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: “It’s no secret that we’re a go-to destination for major events and international conferences with substantial visitor and delegate footfall guaranteed as far in advance as 2022. “The opening of three new hotels is a clear indication that confidence is at an all-time high in Glasgow. “The new openings will drive job creation and boost our already thriving tourism and hospitality sector, an industry that supports the employment of some 30,000 people. “Last year Glasgow’s reputation for its warmth and hospitality was reaffirmed by travel publication Rough Guides when it was awarded the World’s Friendliest City status; an accolade which was proven time and time again as we welcomed hundreds of thousands of people during the best ever Commonwealth Games. “This combined investment of more than £20million is the perfect bellwether for anyone interested in how Glasgow’s tourism industry is performing.” Denis McCann, General Manager of Radisson Blu and Co-Chair of the Greater Glasgow Hotels Association (GGHA), said: “Glasgow’s tourism industry has experienced an incredible boom period in recent years and investors have clearly identified the city as an area of economic growth. “These new hotel openings will not only boost Glasgow’s extensive accommodation portfolio but it will stimulate the local economy creating jobs in the city’s thriving tourism and hospitality sector. “Whether visitors are coming to Glasgow for conferences, leisure or to enjoy our year-round calendar of major events, they won’t be disappointed with the vast choice of hotels from luxury boutique to premium budget.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:32:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
