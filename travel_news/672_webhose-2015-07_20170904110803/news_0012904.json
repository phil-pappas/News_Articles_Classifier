Summer festivals kick off with the July 1-5 Harborfest, followed by the Outside the Box performing arts festival, July 14-19; Revere Beach National Sand-Sculpting Festival, July 24-26; the Boston Seafood Festival, Aug. 2; and a series of feasts and festivals in the famous North End neighborhood, including the St. Agrippina di Mineo Feast, July 30-31 and Aug. 1-2, the Madonna Della Cava Feast, Aug. 7-9, Fisherman's Feast of the Madonna Del Soccorso di Sciacca, Aug. 13-16; and St. Anthony's Feast, Aug. 28-30. Other outdoor events include Wednesday concerts on the Esplanade with the Boston Landmarks Orchestra (July 15-Aug. 26), Shakespeare on the Common's \"King Lear\" (July 22-Aug. 9), and the Boston Summer Arts Weekend in Copley Square (July 25-26). A free weekend shuttle to Columbia Point takes visitors to the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate, The Commonwealth Museum and the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. A replica of the ship that carried the Marquis de Lafayette to Boston, the Hermione, docks at Rowes Wharf for free public tours the weekend of July 11-12. The city's twice-yearly restaurant promotion, Dine Out Boston, takes place Aug. 16-21 and Aug. 23-28. At the Boston Opera House, \"Kinky Boots\" plays Aug. 11-30. And a gigantic psychedelic pinwheel called \"Fenway Deity\" by Ken Smith hangs on the exterior of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum through Sept. 28. The Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau is encouraging visitors to post their experiences on social media with the hashtag (hash)VacationBoston. --- FOOD APPS Travel + Leisure magazine's July issue focuses on food, including recommendations for four apps that T+L says are \"changing the way we eat out.\" Most restaurant-goers are familiar with sites like Yelp, Chowhound and OpenTable, but T+L has picked out a few that aren't on most diners' radar just yet. Tocktix.com allows diners to book a table at select restaurants and prepay meals, with discounts offered for off-peak dining. Table8.com and Resy.com sell reservations last-minute for a $20 to $30 surcharge, while Reserve.com offers a \"personal dining concierge service\" recommending restaurants and arranging bookings for a $5 fee. --- VENTURA'S SURF RODEO A two-day surf and music festival takes place at Ventura, California's Pierpont Beach July 11-12. The event includes competitions, rodeo games, a music festival, street fair with vendors, bikini cowgirl contest and beer garden. The surf competitions begin at 8 a.m. Contestants use vintage surf boards and draw straws to determine which one they'll ride. The rodeo includes mechanical bull riding, a greased pig contest and an obstacle race. For selfies and other photo ops, there will be a 10-foot horseshoe.
