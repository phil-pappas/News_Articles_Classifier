This will improve the reliability and lifespan of the escalators which carry 6.5 million passengers a year, a number which is predicted to continue to increase. The work will take place over the next 12 months.\nChris Littler, area manager for Network Rail, said: “It is regrettable that we are not able to reopen the upgraded platform as planned and then continue our work to redevelop the rest of the platform areas. We wanted to make sure that the work was completed to the highest standard so passengers would benefit from and appreciate the investment being made.\n“We have worked closely with Merseyrail throughout and will reschedule the work to avoid major events in the Merseyside area in 2016. The rescheduling means passengers will unfortunately have to wait a little longer to benefit from the improvements and I thank them for their patience.”\nAlan Chaplin, Merseyrail’s managing director, added: “Moorfields is one of our busiest stations, and with Network Rail and Merseytravel, we’re determined to create pleasant environments for our customers that feel light, bright and airy. It’s unfortunate that the Wirral line platform will open three weeks later than scheduled, but the additional funding to replace the escalators is great news for our passengers and highlights our commitment to continually improving safety on the network.”\nSource:-Network Rail\nRelated Posts CN offers conductors’ union in Canada one last chance to reach a contract settlement through negotiation; requires upfront union acceptance of binding arbitration if talks fail Dangerous behaviour at level crossings caught on dash cam Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail The Slopes are Calling!
