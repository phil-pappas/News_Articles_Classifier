Picture: News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nAUSTRALIA is set to be stuck with the lion’s share of the bill for the MH370 search with China refusing to contribute anything despite having the most passengers on board. \nOf the 239 people on the Malaysia Airlines’ flight, 153 were from China, which has played a key role in the decision-making about the search operation. \nAlthough China did send ships from its navy to assist in the early days of the investigation, the country has steadfastly refused to contribute financially to the search. \nFAMILIES REACT TO THE NEWS: ‘I selfishly hope this is not MH370’ Show us the money ...
