The incentive would rebate a portion of the sales tax taken in by the Ark Encounter theme park after it opens. \nKentucky tourism officials have said the massive wooden ark would be an evangelism tool and shouldn't receive tax dollars. \n\"They want all comers to believe what they believe — which is fine — but we don't have to fund it,\" said Virginia Snell, a Louisville lawyer representing the state in the case. \nThe state had initially approved the incentive and even celebrated the theme park proposal a few years ago. But state authorities reversed course last year after seeing statements from website postings and investor meetings that indicated the park would \"be an extension of (Answers in Genesis') ministry.\" \nThe incentive allows major tourism projects in Kentucky to recover 25 percent of development costs through sales tax rebates. It has been awarded to bourbon distilleries, hotels and a speedway that hosts a NASCAR race. \nThe state wants U.S. District Judge Greg Van Tatenhove to dismiss the lawsuit. \nVan Tatenhove noted during a hearing Wednesday that the state's tourism incentive is \"content neutral,\" meaning it doesn't matter if an applicant for the sales tax rebate has a religious purpose. \n\"There is a public purpose here, and it's tourism,\" said Van Tatenhove, whose ruling in the case is expected at a later date. \nConstruction on the ark is underway. \nMedia representatives were invited to the site last week to watch as a giant wooden rib of the ark was set in place by a construction team. The park is expected to open next summer just down the road from the ministry's popular Creation Museum, which was built with $27 million in private donations. \nAnswers in Genesis says the ark will show visitors that stories from the Bible are true accounts of history, a core message of the Creation Museum, which has exhibits that say Adam and Eve were the first humans and the earth is just 6,000 years old. \nThe ministry says the ark could draw up to two million visitors in its first year. \nJohnson said after the court hearing that a loss of the tax incentive would have a serious impact on the ark project, since the money would be used to pay down debt and make capital improvements. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T00:19:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
