The move has the potential to increase competition in Japan by allowing Delta to funnel international passengers via Tokyo to more Japanese cities that Skymark serves. A deal would give Delta a roughly 20 percent stake, although terms must still be concluded and approved by Skymark's creditors, according to the report by Nikkei Asian Review.\nA Delta spokeswoman said, \"It would be premature for us to comment on the matter.\" Delta's President Ed Bastian said last month that the airline had been approached about making the investment.\nSkymark holds many landing slots at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, which connects to cities throughout Japan and which many people prefer to Narita Airport because it is closer to Tokyo's downtown. Skymark's slots are for domestic routes only.\nIf the deal succeeds, Delta could attempt to build Haneda as a transit hub for passengers coming off its flights from Los Angeles. Currently, Delta's connecting opportunities are limited because it has no alliance partner in Japan.\nUnited has an alliance with ANA, and American has an alliance with Japan Airlines.\nAirbus and aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation are the biggest creditors to Skymark, which ran into financial trouble after embarking on an ambitious expansion that included buying Airbus A380s.\nThere are two restructuring plans for Skymark currently on the table, one involving ANA investing in Skymark, and one proposed by Intrepid.\nCreditor approval is key for either Skymark restructuring plan to go ahead.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:42:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
