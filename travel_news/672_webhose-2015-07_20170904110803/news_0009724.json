Having worked alongside his mother from an early age in her outside catering business, his first “proper job” was in his hometown of Harrogate, UK, where he started his career working in the restaurants, bars and banquets of The Old Swan Hotel. From then on he was hooked and has since become a citizen of the world having worked in 10 countries and travelled to more than 60. He has spent the last 20 years as a Four Seasons nomad in paradisiacal islands and vibrant cities starting with Four Seasons in Bali, Kuala Lumpur, Florida and California, then becoming General Manager in Chiang Mai and opening the Tented Camp in the Golden Triangle, followed by further openings in Mauritius and Mumbai.\nWith a passion for languages, Harrison is fluent in English, French and German. Over the years he has found a love for Russian and Indonesian, and his return to Peninsular Malaysia means he’s already working on perfecting his Bahasa Melayu. His latest move has also re-opened the doors to two of his main sporting hobbies: golf and cycling. Having opened Four Seasons Golf Club Mauritius at Anahita (complete with a spectacular Ernie Els-designed course), he’s in familiar territory with Langkawi’s award-winning Els Club, just 25 minutes from the Resort. And while traffic-choked Mumbai made cycling a harrowing experience, he is already enjoying switching gears through the glistening padi fields and traditional kampongs (villages), and is eagerly anticipating the archipelago’s annual Le Tour de Langkawi, Malaysia’s equivalent of Le Tour de France.\n“It’s great to return to Langkawi – this time to work,” comments Harrison. “It’s a relatively undiscovered destination with amazing offerings beyond the postcard beaches. The UNESCO Geopark with its 550-million year old limestone cliffs, rainforest, mangroves, phenomenal birdlife and other indigenous wildlife is a gem to discover.”\nSource:-Four Seasons\nRelated Posts 40% reduction in room rates in Grand Hyatt Taipei in July and August Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Global Coalition “Unite for Heritage” launched in Bonn by UNESCO Express your love this Valentine’s Day at Calabash Cove Resort & Spa Jason Pomeranc, hotelier announces launch of new brand of hotel Sixty Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:50:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
