While Nassau is our capital, Exuma… known for its unique swimming pigs, Eleuthera… known for its famous Glass Window Bridge, and Abaco… a boaters’ paradise… are very popular destinations within the Islands. Of course, we are also very excited that the service to Exuma will now be operated daily, at more than double the current capacity. In a time when the airline industry is generally cutting back on frequencies and capacity, Delta’s latest announcement is proof positive that The Bahamas is and will continue to be a top destination worldwide for visitors. As we like to say, ‘It’s Better in the Bahamas!’” said Joy Jibrilu, Director General, Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. \nFor inspiration and to find out more about Eleuthera, Abaco, and Exuma, and why they’re unique and exciting destinations, visit Bahamas.com today.
