Director, Eddy Kirya, that did the ground handling. Sophia visited Northern Uganda where she was able to meet the women there who are creating each line's jewelry, apparel, and accessories as a way to improve livelihoods of impoverished and vulnerable communities in Gulu town recovering after the end of 20 years of insurgency. \n\"Being conscious of what you support, even though such simple actions as buying a bracelet or necklace for a loved one, can literally impact entire communities halfway around the world,\" she said. \"The gratitude that these women put into each piece they make is palpable here. Talk about the meaning of 'being made with love.'” \nThe beautiful actress also had the chance to go on a safari in Murchison Falls National Park located along the great Albertine Graben after which she visited The Source of The Nile in Jinja town famously known as the “Adventure Capital of East Africa.” \nHer instagram post stated of her visit, “I’m leaving Uganda today with a full heart, an inspired mind, and an activated spirit. There is so much joy here. The women we spent our time with will forever be stitched into my heart. And they've taught me a thing or two about how to greet your friends with the most epic welcome dances! I can't wait to show you all what I'm cooking up with Akolaproject, Ssekodesigns, and 31Bits! #FashionWithPurpose, #ConsciousCommerce, and #UgandaBeInspired”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T02:16:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
