And this year, the first round will take place at Khao Yai Da, a hill near Rayong's Ban Phae where you can take the boat to the famous Koh Samet. There are both cross-country and downhill trails here. The latter is well maintained by a group of local downhillers called DH Café Rayong. \nJointly organised by DH Café Rayong and Mojo Bikes, the first round of Thailand Gravity Series 2015 (Mojo Downhill) will take place this weekend. This is the second year that the bike shop is hosting the race series, and rather than being a serious competition it is more like a fun event for riders from all parts of the country. \nThe DH track at Khao Yai Da is considered highly technical, with plenty of exciting jumps, drop-offs, slippery roots and a nasty rock garden. \nHowever, at all of those risky spots there is always a chicken-run line for those who prefer going slowly but surely. So, no matter what your skill level and what kind of bike you use, you can still enjoy adrenaline-rushing moments along the challenging downhill track here. It is highly recommended that every rider wears a full-face helmet and other protective gear to ensure safety. \nLet's take a closer look at the race course. The start is in front of the Channel 5 transmission tower at the top of the hill. A few metres after the first pedal you will be warmed up with a waist-high drop. Of course, there's an optional, yet slower, line where you can go around it. After another ramp you will run into a highlight of the trail — the stream gap jump. \nBut there's nothing to fear now because the trail builders have covered the gap with a wooden bridge so now everyone can jump without the risk of falling into the stream. Next is the steep section which you can either jump down or roll over. Soon you will hit a rock garden. It's actually easier to ride through it with some speed. \nBut if you don't have the confidence to go fast, slow down and make sure you still have some momentum to keep the wheels moving forward or just walk it. The trail has some more drops. At the end, trail builders have put a few dirt jumps so riders can have some more fun before the finish line at the foot of the hill. \nThe cross-country trail at Khao Yai Da is also very nice and technical. If you don't feel like going for a downhill run, give it a go on the cross-country track. Cyclists come to practice here on the weekend, early morning or in the evening.
