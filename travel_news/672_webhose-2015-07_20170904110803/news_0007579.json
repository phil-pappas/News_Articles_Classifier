Framed by the distant Channel and closer woodlands, the curves of Goodwood racecourse follow the undulations of the Downs on to the finishing straight flanked by the bright white pavilions of the grandstand. During the festival long known as Glorious Goodwood, the scene is further embellished by hordes of fashionable racegoers watching the finest thoroughbreds compete for historic and lucrative prizes. I have seen more racecourses, in this country and abroad, than my bank manager would wish, but Goodwood beats them all for beauty. Chantilly in France has charm, Hong Kong’s Happy Valley a floodlit glamour and Melbourne on Cup Day is bonkers, but England is the historic and spiritual home of horse racing, and Glorious Goodwood its most civilised expression. I have seen more racecourses, in this country and abroad, than my bank manager would wish, but Goodwood beats them all for beauty Andrew Baker Better than Ascot, Aintree and Cheltenham? I believe so. Ascot is synonymous with the ultimate in sporting poshness , and there is no denying the quality of the racing at the Royal meeting. But the pomp and ceremony, the near-impenetrability of the Royal Enclosure for all but the most privileged, and the onerous demands of both high fashion (female) and rigorous dress code (male) all tend against relaxed enjoyment. And away from the privilege the cheap enclosures are far from any meaningful sporting action. Both Aintree and Cheltenham are more democratic in their viewing opportunities, but the Liverpool spectacular is all about just one freakish race, while Cheltenham’s annual jamboree is justly held sacred by fans of jump racing but even they would have to admit that it is as exhausting for racegoers as it is for the horses. Great views of the action are available to all at Goodwood [STEVE PARSONS] Goodwood, by comparison, trumps all three. It is fashionable but not slavishly so, exclusive but not oppressive or unduly elitist. Great views of the action are available to all (some even for free) and the sport itself is of the highest class but not confined to one headline event. All of which explains why the racing week at Glorious Goodwood has been an essential fixture on the British calendar for more than a century. Traditionally, the festival marks the end of the summer social season, or “The Season” as dowagers and their debutante granddaughters used to know it. It is the last hurrah for the warm-weather finery before the smart hats and floaty dresses are packed away (or consigned to Oxfam) and the tweeds and labradors are loaded on to the train for the journey to the moors. Goodwood is fashionable but not slavishly so, exclusive but not oppressive or unduly elitist. Andrew Baker Few people follow the calendar so rigidly any more but, even so, Goodwood is the last of the major British summer sporting events that keep the paparazzi so busy from the Chelsea Flower Show in May onwards. It has been a fixture on the list since early in the 20th century when the Prince of Wales, responsible for establishing so many upper-class pastimes, first declared that racing week at Goodwood was “a garden party with racing tacked on”. For His Royal Highness this was quite literally the case, for he was a frequent guest of the family at Goodwood House, on whose estate the racecourse stands. But his remark has gained resonance down the years and come to represent a kind of ideal to which all organisers of summer sporting occasions aspire: the All England Lawn Tennis Club based their recent reconstruction of their Wimbledon site on the notion of “tennis in an English garden” . Edward VII – as he later became – set the social tone to such an extent that he was able single-handedly to establish the more relaxed sartorial code that distinguishes Glorious Goodwood, adopting a lounge suit and Panama hat rather than the tailcoat and topper that remain de rigueur at Ascot. As “Prinny” might have put it: unless you are a jockey, don’t make it look as if you are trying too hard. Tom Cruise arrives on Ladies Day at Glorious Goodwood in 2014 [CHRISTOPHER PLEDGER] Unquestionably the smartest thing to be seen doing at Goodwood is collecting the winner’s trophy for one of the two prestigious Group One races, the Nassau Stakes and the Sussex Stakes . But if top-class racehorse ownership is still pending, there are easier ways to get closer to the winners. Goodwood’s prime social spot is the Richmond Enclosure (the family of the Duke of Richmond and Gordon own the Goodwood Estate). This is where the Members and their guests reside, and it overlooks both the pre-race Parade Ring behind the grandstands and the finish line, so you can pick your winner before the race and cheer it home minutes later. It is the only area of the track where a dress code applies, but this is not too forbidding: no jeans or training shoes please, gentlemen, and jacket and tie, cravat or dashing polo neck. Of all the great British race meetings, Goodwood is the classiest Ellie Pithers Next door, not quite as close to the finish line but also overlooking the Parade Ring, is the Gordon Enclosure, a little more relaxed both sartorially and in terms of ticket availability. Next along is the family-friendly Lennox Enclosure with live music and a playground for the youngest racegoers – you can consume a picnic here as well. There is another option for social explorers who are up for a laugh and not over-fussy about the company they keep: Trundle Hill, the eminence that overlooks the entire racecourse from some way away, is annexed on race day by knowledgeable locals and adventurous visitors. There are bookmakers and food stalls but not much else, and things can get a little lively towards the end of the day – but no worse than the infield at Epsom on Derby Day and the view, if distant, is a great deal more spectacular. New for this year, and produced especially for the festival by the Hummingbird Bakery, is the yellow frosted Glorious Goodwood cupcake. (Do not feed these to the jockeys.) Andrew Baker Wherever you find yourself based for the day, decide your tactics. If you intend to take a close interest in the racing, work out a triangular route between parade ring, bookmaker and a spot with a view of the finishing line – which is opposite the left-hand end of the Richmond Enclosure. If you are more interested in people-watching, the parade ring is guaranteed to attract the best-connected (and best-dressed) racegoers. The Winners Enclosure is where celebrity prize-givers will be on duty. If you fancy a break in the routine and an alternative view of a crucial part of the racing, excursions to the starting point for the races are available from the Richmond and Gordon Enclosures. Far from the grandstands it is eerily quiet – or would be if it weren’t for the urgent cussing of the stalls-handlers and jockeys, and the whinnying of their charges. Edie Campbell winning the inaugural Magnolia Cup in 2011 [EDDIE MULHOLLAND] There is a huge variety of refuelling options to choose from (though some of the smartest are reserved as part of hospitality packages). New for this year, and produced especially for the festival by the Hummingbird Bakery, is the yellow frosted Glorious Goodwood cupcake. (Do not feed these to the jockeys.) We have already touched on the sporting highlights of the meeting but the event which combines sporting excellence and glamour in a genuinely unique way is the Magnolia Cup on Ladies Day (Thursday) in which talented celebrity amateur riders compete wearing silks designed by prestigious designers. Previous winners include the supermodel Edie Campbell , and last year the winner’s trophy was presented by Tom Cruise. Sporting excellence, glamour and laid-back style: that’s Goodwood’s glorious combination. LOOKING GOOD AT GOODWOOD Of all the great British race meetings, Goodwood is the classiest. Let Ascot keep its top hats and dress-strap measurements – even their draconian dress code can’t stop punters donning saucer brims adapted to look like a plate of full English breakfast. There are no such camera-hogging antics at Goodwood, where the dress code can roughly be translated as Garden Party Chic. There are standards: in the more formal Richmond enclosure, gentlemen are encouraged to wear jackets and ties (if one mislays the latter, as Bill Nighy did a couple of years ago , a new one can be had for a £5 charity donation), and most opt for linen suits. Ladies are ushered towards hats. While not obligatory, hats are becoming more popular, although those that look as though they have plundered peacocks of their tails will receive a lukewarm reception. Better to opt for a dainty pillbox or elegant straw hat – this year’s in-house milliner, Emily Baxendale of Emily London , has a fantastic selection of reasonably priced pieces made especially for the West Sussex racecourse. Her pale juniper Lavant headband , featuring handmade silk chiffon flowers and dried sea lavender, is a youthful alternative to a traditional saucer; her Hadlow cream panama , trimmed with dried flowers, is the ultimate in effortless headgear. Both can be made to order to match an outfit by appointment at her showroom . Some punters plump for cocktail dresses. At the risk of sounding like a dowager aunt, these will look faintly tarty in the bright sunlight. Ellie Pithers In Goodwood’s other enclosures, less formal attire is appropriate, the only stipulation being a ban on bare chests and fancy dress. The upshot of such leniency is that some punters plump for cocktail dresses. At the risk of sounding like a dowager aunt, these will look faintly tarty in the bright sunlight. Far better to opt for a flowy boho dress or a structured, printed shirt dress, paired with a wedged sandal or block heel – stilettos will have you staggering around even before a sip of Champagne. Don’t forget a scarf – the sea breezes can occasionally prove chilly, check out Liberty’s zingy 140th anniversary collection – or your sunglasses. Last year’s flashbulb storm when Tom Cruise turned up was enough to blind even the most disinterested of celeb-spotters. Ellie Pithers , Telegraph Fashion MARK YOUR CARD: RACING AT GOODWOOD For racing professionals and fans alike, Glorious Goodwood is not only one of the most prestigious meetings but, after its re-branding as the Qatar Goodwood Festival , it is also one of the most valuable. The big race of the week is the £1m Qatar Sussex Stakes, one of the great mile races and a first opportunity for this year’s Classic generation (three-year-olds) to take on their elders at the highest level. The global reputation of the “ Duel on the Downs ” was further enhanced when it was won two years in succession by the late Sir Henry Cecil’s superstar Frankel . An exciting contest is in prospect this year when the unbeaten 2,000 Guineas winner Gleneagles, from Ireland, takes on the French-trained Solow . The undulating course is tricky to ride. Jockeys invariably go hard off the home bend where the track is also downhill – but that is a long way from the finish, and at the closing stages you often see front-runners tiring and falling back. In the big handicaps, finding a gap to run through – or failing to – can play a huge part in winning. The veteran jockey Richard Hughes, who hangs up his boots at the end of the meeting on Saturday night, rides it as well as anyone while the trainers who seem to do well here include Richard Hannon and Mark Johnston. Sussex trainers like to do well at Goodwood and although Ed Dunlop trains in Newmarket he was born and bred in Arundel – look out for his Trip to Paris in the Qatar Goodwood Cup Marcus Armytage Johnston’s success at the track is all the more remarkable because he trains at Middleham in the Yorkshire Dales, a 315-mile journey away. He can hardly buy a winner at his big local track, York, but he has saddled 63 winners at Glorious Goodwood since 1991. He has been leading trainer at the meeting nine times, but punters beware; he will target lots of horses at the handicaps and it is not always the shortest price one which wins. Sussex trainers like to do well at Goodwood and although Ed Dunlop trains in Newmarket he was born and bred in Arundel – look out for his Trip to Paris in the Qatar Goodwood Cup.
