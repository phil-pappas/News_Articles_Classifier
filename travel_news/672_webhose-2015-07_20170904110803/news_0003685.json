It’s exactly what travel professionals should be doing,” he said. \nBut with 82 countries around the world where being gay is still a criminal offence, he added that travel businesses and Abta itself have a huge duty of care for LGBT travellers. \n“The lack of tolerance in some destinations is a painful fact that we have to recognise, and our first duty is to protect customers,” he insisted. \nWith 3,000 same-sex civil partnerships and marriages taking place in the UK each year, and LGBT travellers spending more on travel, on average, compared to other travellers, Tanzer said the potential of the market is huge. \nHowever, he warned against stereotyping the LGBT market and said a personalised, customised approach is as important in this market as any other. \n“You need to move beyond thinking of the customer as part of the LGBT segment. The customer thinks of themselves as an individual first and foremost and you must meet their individual needs,” he advised. \nTravel businesses embracing LGBT people within their own companies was another important step in opening up to the LGBT market, he added, since it will both help travel firms attract the very best talent, and help companies get closer to LGBT customers’ trends and habits. \nWhile the travel industry is “not the worst” industry in terms of diversity and acceptance within its workforce, “we do need to kick on,” he warned. \n“Travel is a high-touch industry and the only way you can deliver consistently in a high-touch environment is to have a really strong set of values [within your business]. It’s not just slogans on a website; you can’t spin these things. The foundations have to be right and genuine,” he insisted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:32:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
