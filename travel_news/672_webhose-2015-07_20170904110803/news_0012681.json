And image sales to parents are increasing daily.” The company has also enjoyed recognition. Earwig was a Bett (tech in education) Award finalist in 2015, and was used as an example of how technology is improving education in a video by the Department of Education. We knew that Earwig would save teachers’ time and sanity It’s quite a rise, given just how new Earwig is, but it is a business that has skilfully tapped into the trend for crowdfunding. “We raised money via crowdfunding in early 2014 to enable us to get the software into our initial batch of 50 schools,” says Kidd. “This was successful and now we have 100 schools on board. So we’ve gone back to Crowdcube to raise more to develop the next generation of Earwig and ramp up the marketing to get it into every school in the UK.” The company claims the Earwig app takes the stress out of Ofsted inspections, delights parents and makes money for schools. The app gathers together, organises and links all the photos and videos that are taken in class as “teaching evidence” for Ofsted, and which would otherwise be lost in the school system, and makes them available and useful. “Earwig automatically links these to pupils, subjects and so on, and turns them into digital records which are presented as timelines for every pupil, subject, class, year or key stage,” says Kidd. “So schools are always Ofsted-ready.” A further revenue stream for Earwig is that parents also get a secure login to their child’s timeline, giving them insights into school life. Digital images, prints, or video DVDs can be bought directly from the website as a memento of a child’s school career. The company aims to take Earwig to Australia and the US, and then to roll out into other international markets. In the past few months, it has also taken a logical sidestep into offering professional photo shoots in schools. “We knew that Earwig would be successful in saving teachers’ time and sanity, but the candid school photographs have created a whole new market worth an estimated £100m,” says Kidd. “The path for this market is now clear, and crowdfunding will enable us to offer Earwig to every school in the UK.” Applied pupils The three tech advances that made Earwig possible: Crowdfunding Earwig’s founders raised enough to seed their product in 50 schools Smartphones Photos or videos can be uploaded to a teacher’s phone with a few keystrokes Social media Parents are used to following their kids on Facebook, so an academic version is an easy sell See how technology is helping to transform other businesses at HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • What is lean start-up philosophy? • Consider it signed, sealed and sent with Sendy • Gaming and gambling: a new cocktail from Geonomics • Soundcheque's pitch perfect plan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:27:38.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
