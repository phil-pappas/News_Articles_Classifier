Avenue, the last of which was scheduled for demolition by the SM Development Company.\n\"SM is planning to demolish the Philam Life Building and move its auditorium to the Mall of Asia,\" Celdran says through a hand-held loudspeaker.\nThere was talk by SM about preservation but the fate of the building is still in limbo according to the conservationists.\n\"Take action, go online using the hashtag #SavePhilam and tell them to stop!\"\nAs the tour reaches its climax, Celdran takes his social activism up a notch.\nAt Luneta Park, participants of the tour take a group photo in front of Rizal Monument with the Torre de Manila, a controversial luxury property development, looming in the background.\nCeldran criticizes it as an example of poor urban planning.\nIn June, construction of the building was temporarily halted in response to a petition that accused it of ruining the sightline of the Rizal Monument .\nCeldran encourages tour group members to pose for a picture while pumping their fists at the building now derisively labeled the \" Philippines ' photobomber.\"\nLuneta Hotel , 414 T.M.

The irreverent Celdran has become an unlikely scholar of the city.\nAt his high-ceilinged Malate home, not far from the Adriatico Cafe, he pores over details of what makes this original Manila City so \"real.\"\nThere are boxes of books by the doorway, donations given at previous Old Manila barter tours.\n\"You have ocean front, then you have residential area in a grid pattern that leads you to the national park, governmental buildings and a 17th century walled city,\" Celdran says.\n\"It's wonderfully planned but was never given a chance to shine,\" he says. \"A grand plan gone wrong.\"\nFor sure, the bayside districts of Malate and Ermita are now synonymous with poor urban planning.\nSidewalks are absent and buildings falling apart.\nWhat life remains is woven into the itinerary of the Old Manila tour, which Celdran hopes will speak to Filipino youth and remind them that their city has more to offer than shopping malls.\n\"None of us know the story of our heritage because we are all in the malls,\" Celdran says. \"There is a need to fill a hole, which is why so many young Filipinos have joined these tours.\"\nThe response to \"Walk this Way\" led Celdran to co-found VivaManila , a community group that began as a hashtag he and friends living in Old Manila used to create social media vignettes of life in the overlooked origins of the Philippine metropolis.\nExpose people to the heritage of their city, the idea goes, and neglected areas will begin to gentrify with the help of art and culture.\nAnd, unlike in the business center of Makati, there is ample room in the older districts to restore and grow.\n\"In Old Manila, there is a high percentage of underperforming land,\" says Julia Nebrija, executive director of VivaManila and a consultant at the World Bank.\n\"It can be revived by showing the potential of the place and its people. Not just by respecting the past, but showing creative possibilities of the future.\"\n\"Remember, if you want to save your heritage architecture, you must use your heritage architecture,\" adds Celdran.\nMORE: Island in the sun: Where to live large on Boracay\nA \" Walk this Way \" tour of Old Manila's Malate and Ermita districts will be held on July 25 at 3 p.m. Email celdrantours@hotmail.com or text Lesley at +63 920 909 2021 for reservations.
