However, before you go overseas, there are a few things that you should double check. \nAre the Benefits Available Where You Are Travelling? \nThe EHIC card is a useful thing to take with you when you go overseas, but you do need to make sure you can use it in your chosen destination. It is only of use in EEA countries, so if you are travelling outside of Europe, you need to be aware it will not be valid. If you are not sure whether your destination falls within the parameters, check on the NHS website before you go. \nDoes It Cover Everything for Free? \nThe chances are that your EHIC card will not cover every type of medical treatment for free; in fact, there is usually a small fee involved. However, this differs from country to country. For example, a visit to a doctor may be completely free in some countries but may cost in others. In addition, you may find that you will be charged for dental care or for filling a prescription. You should always do some prior research so you're fully aware of what to expect before you go, and always take some extra money to cover any medical fees. \nIs Your Card Still Valid? \nDon't leave it until the last minute to check whether your EHIC card is still valid. The card must be renewed every few years so if a number of years have passed since you applied for your card, make sure you check in good time so you can apply for a new one if necessary. \nAre You Applying in the Right Place? \nThe best way to get the card is to visit the official NHS website then apply for it online or by phone. However, do be extra vigilant to ensure you're actually on the official website and not an unscrupulous phoney site. The card is always completely free, but unfortunately a number of websites have popped up requesting payment for them to arrange it for you. It's simple: if you are asked to hand over any money, you know that you are not on the correct website. \nMake Sure You're Covered \nEnsuring you are properly covered is essential before you travel. However, remember that while the card is an excellent measure for peace of mind, it does not replace the need for private travel insurance. Source:   ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nP.K.
