Uber Technologies Inc. is reaching outâ€¦ more Uber Technologies Inc. is reaching out to senior passengers who no longer drive to offer them more independence, and Phoenix and Tucson are two of the pilot cities for the expanded focus. San Francisco-based Uber is seeking senior centers and organizations to host educational training sessions on signing up and using the Uber ride-sharing service, said Steve Thompson , general manager of Uber Arizona. \"We realize 26 million elderly Americans depend on others for transportation,\" Thompson said. \"It's not just a local issue, but a national issue. We are excited to grow Uber and help increase senior independence.\" Since Uber doesn't collect the age of its customers for privacy reasons, Uber couldn't say how many seniors already use its service. Besides Phoenix and Tucson, Uber launched its senior focus and pilot program in Columbus, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Ventura County, California; and Gainesville and Miami Lakes, Florida. \nWant Albany Travel news in your inbox?
