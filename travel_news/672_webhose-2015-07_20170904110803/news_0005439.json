They wanted to buy all they could, for fear of losing half of their savings,” said Stephanie, a saleswoman in a family-owned jewellery store in the capital’s up-market Kolonaki neighbourhood.\nJewellery made of gold, a traditional safe-haven metal, and luxury watches, some of which cost up to 6,000 euros, were snatched up by “not especially rich” customers aged 30 to 50, the 28-year-old employee said.\n“Greeks: I don’t understand them. Me, I’d never spend my money in these times,” Stephanie added.\nSince Athens struck a deal with its eurozone partners on Monday, easing fears of a “Grexit” or a “bail-in”, where bank deposits are seized, the Greek customers have been replaced by the usual tourist clientele.\nAnd the rush of “protective spending”, covering high-margin expense items, hasn’t turned around Greece’s economic fortunes. According to the National Confederation of Greek Business, retail sales fell 70 per cent between June 27 and July 10, compared to the same period a year earlier.\nOnly purchases of fuel and food increased, seen as proof the country is well and truly in crisis.\nAnti-austerity protesters marched in front of the Greek parliament on Wednesday.
