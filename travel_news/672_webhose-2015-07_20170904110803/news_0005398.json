She asks: Should I move my business to the cloud? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: There is much talk about the cloud among small and medium-sized businesses, with good reason. Many of the stand-out features of using cloud-based computing are particularly useful for small and growing businesses. At its simplest, moving your business to the cloud means that instead of storing data and installing software applications on your firm’s own physical hard drive which sits in your office by your desk, you store your data and access applications remotely via the internet. You can’t see or touch them, but they are there. Indeed, you are probably using several cloud-based services in your business already, almost without realising it – Google Drive, Microsoft 365, Dropbox and YouTube are all based in the cloud. The big appeal for small businesses is that by storing files in a virtual rather than a physical place, they can be accessed by anyone in your team, from anywhere. This means that employees in different locations can collaborate on the same master document, which in turn means that the idea of flexible working becomes much more possible. Using the cloud can also work out cheaper than buying storage and software for your hard drive, because the services are offered on a subscription-based model, so you only pay for what you need, and you can add or remove services as required. And as more firms switch to the cloud, the cost is likely to drop further. There are, however, two big concerns – how secure your data is going to be, and how reliable the services you need will be. You are effectively entrusting your firm’s most vital information to an external provider, so you need to be confident that they will look after it properly. The last thing you want is to discover that you can’t access your software when you need it because the technology has failed, or that your data security has been breached. So the solution is to start small. Moving to the cloud doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing decision, and should not be. So pick and choose what cloud-based services and applications you feel comfortable using, see what works best for your business and take it from there. Steve Folwell is the managing director of LOVESPACE, a storage company which collects and delivers the items to be stored from your house. He adds: If yours is a small or medium-sized business, then the answer is probably yes, you should move to the cloud. Our experience with the cloud has been very positive. In the early stages, we found it much easier to get off the ground using cloud computing because of the much lower capital cost involved. Technology that would previously have been prohibitively expensive for startups is now readily accessible for small businesses, and has allowed us to build excellent infrastructure upon which to grow our storage business rapidly. Now that we manage more than 25,000 square feet of warehouse space, with collections and deliveries all over the UK, cloud computing has enabled us to scale rapidly while maintaining high service levels. You don’t necessarily have to rush straight in and move everything over at once, however – we have increased the number of cloud-based applications that we use over time, from Microsoft 365, Google Drive and Dropbox, to Xero for accounting, ZenDesk for customer experience. To ensure that these systems are being used effectively, it is important to have the right staff in place internally. For example, we now have an in-house team looking specifically at cloud-based coding to provide the best possible user experience for customers. • However you choose to run your business, the right company car, financed in the best way makes good sense.
