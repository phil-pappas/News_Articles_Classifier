To add to this, kids can enjoy a babyccino, while adults can sip on an array of fine teas or one of Gallery Mess’ fabulous cocktails, or a flute of bubbles for an additional £8.25. \nDesigned by the ever-innovative restaurant operator “rhubarb” the Origamitea is available daily, priced at £7.50pp and the adults Afternoon Tea is priced at only £15.50pp/£29.50 for two. \nLocated next to the Saatchi Gallery, Gallery Mess provides an excellent space to relax after an educational trip around the contemporary gallery next door, or as a pit stop on your way to another adventure. \nADDRESS:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T21:44:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
