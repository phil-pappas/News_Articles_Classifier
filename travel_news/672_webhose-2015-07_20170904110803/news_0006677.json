The letter is a significant shift in attitudes from lenders, who have until now been careful not to criticise anti-bank policies too heavily in the wake of the financial crisis, understanding the strength of public and political anger at the industry and its role in causing the recession. The plea by the British Bankers Association comes as Britain’s manufacturers have also urged for measures to boost productivity while the Institute of Directors has said that the tax system must be simplified to encourage investment. The bank levy was first introduced in 2010 by Mr Osborne at a rate of 0.05pc on of each of the UK-based bank’s balance sheets, but the Chancellor has since raised the levy nine times to 0.21pc currently. The chancellor increased taxes on banks by £5.3bn in March The levy was originally intended to encourage lenders to shrink but Mr Osborne has since said that banks could make a bigger contribution to repair public finances. “The time is overdue for a strategic review of the Government’s policy for taxing banks, to ensure that the tax regime for banking remains competitive. We would like the Government to consider reform of the bank levy,” the BBA’s chief executive Anthony Browne wrote in his letter to the Chancellor.” The British Bankers' Association's chief Anthony Browne is becoming increasingly vocal on the bank levy The banking industry also wants the Chancellor to intervene in the latest proposals on bank capital from the international Basel Committee, which it says threaten to drive up the cost of mortgages for first-time buyers. “New mortgages are likely to become much more costly as banks are forced to hold more capital and cannot even re-evaluate risk exposure over the lifetime of a loan, by taking account of changing house prices, narrowing loan to value margins or improved affordability,” the BBA said. Meanwhile, the IoD has said that easy-to-understand tax breaks would encourage more people to buy shares in entrepreneurial businesses. “The IoD is calling on George Osborne to create an 'equity economy’, by making sure the tax system promotes investment and is easy for both individuals and businesses to understand”, said Simon Walker, director general of the IOD. The lobbying body has also said that there should be a consultation on merging inheritance and capital gains tax to remove the possibility of a double levy on capital. Britain’s manufacturers have separately said the Government must continue to maintain the pipeline of infrastructure projects and protect research and development tax credits to encourage investment. “The challenge for this government is to take the economy from recovery to sustainable growth”, said Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers organisation EEF. “That requires stable policy with an eye to building the skills, infrastructure and technological innovation which will allow internationally competitive, high productivity companies to succeed in the UK”, he added. Small house builders have become an early beneficiary of this week’s Budget after the Department for Communities and Local Government announced a £100m fund, alongside Lloyds Banking Group, to help smaller builders recruit workers and increase housing supply.
