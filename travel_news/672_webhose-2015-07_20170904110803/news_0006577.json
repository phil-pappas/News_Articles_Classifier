Then a stay-cation is just what you need. In recent years, they have become increasingly popular. Here are some things you should take into consideration if youre thinking of planning one for your family. Why might a stay-cation be a good choice for your family? *They are usually less expensive compared to the cost of taking a family trip. *They usually generate far less stress than traveling with children. *Staying home and spending time with your own family usually translates to less vacation drama . (No need to spend time with relatives that cause tension.) *Being at home usually means less junk food for the family since it allows you to have more control over meals than you would when traveling. What is a family stay-cation like? *It should still feel like a family get-away . *It is a time for the family to be together with no outside commitments (dentist appointments, swimming lessons, etc ) *It should include fun activities for everyone in the family from the oldest to the youngest. *You may want to stay right in your hometown during your stay-cation, or you may want to plan day trips to nearby tourist attractions. How do I actually make it feel like a vacation? *Get the whole family involved in the planning. *Determine ahead of time a realistic length of time. (a whole week? a long weekend?) *Pretend youre a tourist, and head to the sites in your area that visitors would want to go to. *Visit your town/state visitor center (either online or in person) to get ideas about things in your area that you may never have visited before. *Bring out the camera, and take cheesy vacation pictures. *Attempt to plan the stay-cation around local festivals, so you can make them part of your entertainment. *Try to minimize the cooking by making freezer meals ahead of time, using the crockpot, or ordering take-out. *Consider relaxing the household rules a bit just as many people do when they go on vacation. Perhaps the kids could be allowed more screen time or later bed times or a little more junk food than usual. *Eliminate as many chores as possible during the designated stay-cation (just like when you stay in a hotel). Do all laundry and deep cleaning ahead of time, and save the clean-up of any newly created mess for after the family time ends (within reason). *Include quiet time. Vacations can be exhausting, and if you plan events for every part of every day, family members are sure to become tired and grumpy. *Think about the little things that make your family vacations fun, and try to include those things whenever possible in your stay-cation. What are some ideas for stay-cation fun? *camping in your backyard *visiting nearby state or national parks *a day (or more) at a local amusement park *museums with childrens exhibits *make smores over a fire pit *have a picnic in the park The way you choose to enjoy your family stay-cation will greatly depend on the needs and desires of your family. Whatever you decide to do, it is sure to be great fun for everyone if you do a little work and planning in advance.
