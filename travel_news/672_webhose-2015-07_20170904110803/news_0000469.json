Currently, 14 per cent of our international visitors participate in an Aboriginal cultural experience during their trip, helping to inject $6.4 billion annually into our visitor economy.\n“We’re confident this new short film, and our plans to make sure it is widely distributed both in Australia and overseas, will help promote this important facet of Australian tourism and grow these figures,” Mr O’Sullivan added.\nThe film will be shown in Australia and a number of Tourism Australia’s key international markets, including China, Germany, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, the UK and the USA where it is expected to be seen on TV, online and in cinemas by more than 50 million people over the next few weeks.\nThe film has already received strong backing from the tourism industry, including airports (Sydney Airport), international airlines (Etihad Airways and Virgin Australia) and hotel groups (AccorHotels Australia and IHG) who have all agreed to provide a platform to show the film to their passengers, guests and employees.\nRelated Posts Tourism Australia boasts 5 million Facebook page fans worldwide Tourism Australia to increase international tourism numbers with its indigenous short film Australia to highlight indigenous tourism offering through movie New film project with director Warwick Thornton to highlight Australia’s Indigenous tourism offering Tourism campaign to entice UK youth to Queensland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T10:04:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
