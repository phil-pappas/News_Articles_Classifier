It allowed them to have first dibs on the most popular seats, sit in any seat of their choosing, and guarantee seating with family and friends when booking together. Before then, travelers arrived early to claim preferred seating – particularly that at the front of the double decker’s upper level and those situated around tables.\nTravelers will select their seats when booking online. When boarding, other travelers will know certain seats are off-limits because the reserved seats are denoted by a different color of seat fabric and an embroidered seat number.\nThe program has been successful enough that the company has expanded it to meet demand. The additional reservations are being sold now for travel starting Sept. 8.\nReserved seat fees are $1 for regular seats, $3 for a table seat, $5 for a balcony seat and $7 for an upper-deck, front-window seat.\nMore than 600,000 seat reservations have been purchased since the program started last May.\nemail: schristmann@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T08:43:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
