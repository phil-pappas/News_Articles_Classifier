Moreover, the Senate plan would substantially increase the cost of air travel by indexing immigration and customs fees to inflation. In total, the bill makes airline passengers pay $9.2 billion for surface transportation by diverting ticket taxes to the highway trust fund. \n“This is bad, misguided policy that completely ignores the rights of airline passengers, who are already overpaying in taxes to the federal government every time they fly,” said A4A President and CEO Nicholas E. Calio. “Like the House proposal, this wrongly diverts dollars airline passengers pay for safety and security to fund the use of highways. To suggest that airline passengers should pay even more in federal taxes for something unrelated to air travel makes no sense and further punishes some two million taxpayers who fly every day.” \nOn a typical, domestic $300 round-trip ticket, airline passengers can already pay $63 in federal taxes, or 21 percent, a rate that rivals taxes on alcohol and tobacco.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:59:36.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
