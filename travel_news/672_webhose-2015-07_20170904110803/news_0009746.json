The diverse set of attractions and annual events draws visitors who enjoy the outdoorsy, laid-back vibe. \nVisiting Orange County's less-populated neighbor provides a respite from Mickey Mouse ears and the hordes of theme-park tourists. The options are endless and range from seaplane rides to back-to-nature activities such as hiking and bird-watching, plus antique hunting and wine tasting. \nWhen the weather is scorching, a good place to explore is Alexander Springs, located on the southern tip of the Ocala National Forest about 60 miles north of Orlando. The cool blue waters -- 72 degrees year-round -- attract visitors who enjoy snorkeling and swimming as small fish dart under them \nBring your sunblock while you're in the area because you'll want to walk along one of the many trails to see if you can spot a deer, otter or alligator \nAfter kicking off your hiking boots, head south to picturesque Mount Dora. Known for its quaint boutiques and antique stores, the city of almost 13,000 hosts some of the largest events in the county. \nLocated on Lake Dora, the city's most notable landmark stands 35 feet tall. The red-and-white-striped lighthouse -- the only inland lighthouse in Florida -- is a popular photo-op for visitors. After enjoying the waterfront, head downtown, where highlights include the book-lined Goblin Market Restaurant (thegoblinmarketrestaurant.com), tours of the lush Dora Canal (doracanaltour.com) and the Modernism Museum (modernismmuseum.org), which houses unique pieces of furniture by artists such as Wharton Esherick and Wendell Castle. \nA good option for accommodations is the historic Lakeside Inn on North Alexander Street (lakeside-inn.com). You may feel like slipping on bloomers at the inn, which dates to the 1880s and has housed prominent guests such as President Calvin Coolidge. It's the oldest continuously operated hotel in Florida. \nIf you visit in February, you won't want to miss the Mount Dora Arts Festival spread over downtown streets, where more than 250,000 press elbow to elbow through endless rows of fine art, oil paintings, sculptures and more. \nIf you're up for more adventure, look no further than Tavares, dubbed America's Seaplane City, which is just west of Mount Dora. Climb aboard one of the single-engine planes and take a spin over lakes with the Jones Brothers Air & Seaplane Adventures (jonesairandsea.com). \nCounty Road 455 \nGreen Mountain Scenic Byway starts in Oakland as County Road 438 and heads west to Lake County, where it becomes Old Highway 50, then County Road 455. Its twists and turns take you -- and cyclists and motorcyclists -- through some of Central Florida's biggest hills, with views of Lake Apopka and Sugarloaf Mountain -- at 312 feet the highest point in the Florida peninsula -- and the byway ends at County Road 561 south of Howey-in-the-Hills. For a map and more info, go to greenmountainbyway.org/map.html \nRiding in style is the norm with visitors and residents crowding into the Orange Blossom Cannonball -- the \"Movie Train\" that has been featured in numerous films, including \"True Grit\" with Jeff Bridges. It's a refreshingly authentic 1900s experience compared with rides at theme parks. Tickets range from $16.80 to $28 (orangeblossomcannonball.com). \nSpeaking of genuine, the Yalaha Bakery offers just-like-you-were-in-Europe pastries and fresh bread ( www.yalahabakery.com ). The family-owned German bakery is the perfect spot for a quick bite to eat. You can work off the extra calories a couple of miles up County Road 48 at the swanky Mission Inn Resort & Club with a game of golf on one of the oldest courses in the South. \nMaking your way south, take the scenic route through the rolling hills along County Road 455 for a different look at Florida's beauty. Be sure to go to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. It's a sight you won't want to miss. \nReaching the county's largest city -- Clermont, population about 32,000 -- look for the freshly repainted Citrus Tower, a vintage attraction on U.S. Highway 27 that soars as a reminder of days gone by when rows of citrus trees spread beneath it as far as the eye could see, before development took over. Visitors can go to the top of the 226-foot tower, built in 1956, for a fee: $6 for adults and $4 for children (citrustower.com). \nNext door is the Presidents Hall of Fame, an offbeat historical attraction that houses wax figures of the presidents, a treasure trove of presidential memorabilia and the White House in Miniature, a 1-inch-to-1-foot scale replica of the presidential mansion that has been displayed across the globe (thepresidentshalloffame.com). Tickets are $15 for adults and $12 for children. \nWhile you're in the vicinity, consider a pit stop at Lakeridge Winery & Vineyards and kick back with a glass of Southern Red wine while gazing across the rolling vineyard of Muscadine grapes (lakeridgewinery.com). Don't snack on too much cheese while you're there so you have room for a meal at The Crooked Spoon, a gastropub known for its gourmet burgers. \nBefore you leave the area, travel 11 miles south on U.S. 27 to the Showcase of Citrus for a monster-truck ride through thousands of acres of orange groves. You'll be surrounded by the scent of oranges as you venture through the rows of trees, picking your own fruit. Don't forget to grab an orange-juice slushy or a creamsicle (showcaseofcitrus.com). Admission is free but orange grove rides are $25 for adults and $15 for children. \nIf you go \nWhat: Lake County sits in the center of Florida, bordering several counties, including Orange to the east, Polk to the south, Sumter to the west and Marion and Volusia to the north. \nWhere: Clermont is about 25 miles from the tourist-packed city of Orlando, 70 miles from Tampa and 80 from Daytona Beach. \nPopulation: The 2014 estimated population is 309,736. \nAccommodations and other information: Lake County has a variety of hotels, motels and resorts to please any visitor's wants.
