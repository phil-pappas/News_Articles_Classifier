Well at least two of the three questions this week are about those topics.\n\nNYT\nThor Swift / The Associated Press The cost of a car rental can change dramatically from day to day and is often based on events taking place in the city visited. \nQuestion: I booked a car rental in Halifax last week for a total of $854. I rechecked today and the same rental is now $1,250. I have been told this fluctuation is due to a shortage of cars. Is this not the true definition of gouging?\n\nAnswer: For many travel-industry services there really is no fixed price. From car rentals to hotel properties to airline fares prices may change from week to week based on supply and demand.\nSome of this is seasonal, some of it is based on historical patterns of booking, and some of it based on what major events may be taking place in a city or region.\nLast year I was looking online for a hotel room in Las Vegas. The rates for the first two nights were listed at around US$60. On the final night, for the same room in the same hotel, the rate went up to more than US$300.\nThe NASCAR race was starting that week and there were few options for good rates near or far.\nCloser to home, during the recent FIFA Women's World Cup soccer matches in Winnipeg, room rates were sky high compared with the weeks before and after of the event.\nHotel officials knew demand would exceed supply and so they were able to raise rates substantially for the visiting guests.\nTour operators that carry passengers to the most popular sun destinations are able to price according to historical patterns.\nThey want to know that a near specific percentage of the seats and packages are booked by a certain date.\nThey may make allowances for weather patterns that can have a short-term effect.\nBut if they are not satisfied with a booking level, at a certain point they may lower prices for a week or two or more.\nOften customers will say they are going to wait to see if the price goes lower.\nTravel agents try to explain that by doing so they may be disappointed if the price goes up, or miss the opportunity if the flight sells out.\nMost passengers choose to roll the dice and ignore that cautionary advice.\nAirlines allocate a limited number of seats in the budget range, often showing on their websites how many seats are left at that price.\nIf more passengers choose higher-price options because of the additional flexibility they offer, you can be certain some of the budget seats will disappear.\nCompetition helps keep prices down, but supply and demand can drive them up.\nIt is difficult for the ordinary consumer to figure out going in, which side of the curve they are on.\n\nQuestion: My luggage did not meet standards set by the U.S. or Canada, so I bought another set. After reading an article on the International Air Transport Association's recommendations for airlines to reduce the allowable size for carry-ons, I see the new carry-on piece will also be too large.\nAny suggestions about what size I should buy?\n\nAnswer: Many travellers were confused and frustrated by the recent statements by IATA regarding the proposed new restrictions for carry-on luggage.\nAs the airlines followed one another in instituting charges for the first checked bag, they had to know the natural outcome would be more people choosing to take bags in to the cabin to avoid paying the new fees.\nNotwithstanding the challenges that already existed with people taking carry-on bags that were oversized, the airlines had to contend with increased volumes.\nAction one by the airlines was to monitor carry-on bag sizes, to prevent people from taking bags onto the aircraft that exceed guidelines.\nAs many people applauded that decision as derided it.\nPassengers were tired of seeing big bags being forced into small spaces in the overhead compartments, even crushing their own goods.\nBut when IATA passed the motion that would change the rules, there was an immediate backlash from everyone except the luggage manufacturers. Our own national airlines, Air Canada and WestJet, said they would not be implementing the new suggested rules.\nThere is no doubt in my mind as the policy took hold, and the new size restrictions became standard across the industry, they too would have followed. But to their credit they did not jump in with the gleeful knee-jerk reaction so many of the other airlines did.\nOccasionally, consumers' protests work.\nIATA has since pulled back from its stand, as have a number of the airlines that were behind the policy in the first place.\nSo you, and the thousands of other travellers who were angrily preparing to shell out more dollars for smaller bags, do not need to do so at this time.\nBut it is important to still recognize that monitoring for current size regulations will continue.\n\nForward your travel questions to askjourneys@journeystravel.com.
