Nor do the designer furnishings installed by interior decorators, whose bread and butter is extracting more money from you.\nA Commonwealth Bank survey of Australian buyers in 2013 found many admitted to being influenced by emotional characteristics of the property up for sale — and 44 per cent paid more for a property simply because they “really liked it”.\nWith properties selling as much as 10 per cent over the price guide the norm, it’s hard to know when to walk away, especially once buyers get caught up in the theatre of an auction.\nThe ever-present FOMO (fear of missing out) can push a house hunter over the edge and into dangerous overspend territory.\nKeeping emotions in check when an auction is under way is easier said than done. Source: News Corp Australia\nProperty expert Peter Boehm, author of The Great Australian Dream , said first home buyers were particularly vulnerable to being led by their hearts.\nAnd the number one tip he has for them is to “check your emotions at the door”.\n“Buying a property is an emotional experience, because it’s probably the biggest investment you’ll make in your whole life,” Mr Boehm told news.com.au\n“It’s going to be with you for some time, so it’s got to feel right. But the problem with that is that something that might feel right, might be out of your capacity to buy.”\nHe said many first home buyers “start looking at properties they shouldn’t, and then they get discouraged.”\nThey might show up at a few auctions and be quickly outbid, or have an offer on their dream property rejected, then become disheartened by the whole process.\n“Unfortunately, the reality in today’s world is that you’ve got to be pragmatic,” Mr Boehm said.\nThe best approach, he said, was to understand your buying power, set your budget, and only look at suburbs where the median selling price is within it.\nAnd once you are at the auction, “never bid with your heart”.\n“You could end up being a slave to your mortgage and your first home could be a trap, it could be like a prison,” Mr Boehm warned.\nKeep in mind that a sophisticated auctioneer will be working to draw you in, get your confidence, and generate competition among bidders.\n“It’s their job to engage with you and talk about all the good points of the property.”\nIn your dreams: you may one day be swinging from the Venetian glass chandeliers of this $6 million Mt Eliza mansion, but if you’re a first-time buyer, it’s unlikely to be yours soon.

The competitor: “This is the person who is in it to win. It doesn’t matter if they want the house or not, they just don’t want you to have it. They get caught up in ego and pride, because you are bidding against them.”\n2. The dreamer: “The buyer who walks into a house and is off in fantasy land — women are particularly bad at this. They fall in love with a person’s lifestyle or status and are mesmerised by a clean and beautifully-decorated house.”\n3. The adolescent: “Wants it now and doesn’t want to think about the long-term implications, driven by impulse and immediate gratification. Not realistic about price or essential characteristics of the property.”\n4. The narcissist: “This is the person who has the real estate agent tearing their hair out. They believe they should get the house at a better price than anyone else and will not back down, they are grandiose and will fight to the last $1000.\nMs Godfrey said that while we’ve all got a bit of these archetypes in us, watch out for them or you might make a decision you will regret.\nIf you’re standing next to someone who appears to be “bidding without thinking” in a bid to get one up on you, “step back and think. Why is this person bidding this way? Is this becoming a battle?”\nDon’t be swayed by the art and wine collection — it doesn’t come with the house.

Some streets are better than others; do your due diligence.”\nThis means looking past the shiny floorboards and tasteful furnishings which the agent has carefully ensured will capture the eye.\n“The beautiful furniture and styling, it’s all there to make you want to buy. You’ve got to see past that and look at the quality of the structure,” he said.\n“It’s important to look at the floor plan, and check to see if they’re common in the area. If not, you might have trouble selling it because it’s not as suitable,” Mr Gould said.\nAnd it might sound obvious, but take a fine-tooth comb to all the relevant inspection reports.\n“I know people who get the building and pest reports and they don’t even read them,” he said.\nWhat kind of bidder are you? Know your personality type and be aware of your emotions, says psychologist Sarah Godfrey. Source: News Corp Australia\nA good buyer’s agent will take down all the attributes of a potential purchase and put them in a spreadsheet for you, comparing them in detail with similar properties that have sold in the area.\n“We look at the comparable sells — not the ones the seller’s agent puts in front of you, because sometimes they are no directly comparable,” Mr Gould said.\nWhen it comes to bidding at auction, he said, “we’re always there first.”\n“See how many people register, so you know the level of competition. Not all registered bidders will actually bid, but it’s good to keep an eye on what’s going on.”\nThen, he said, look for signs of weakness in your competitors. Mum-and-dad buyers could be spotted a mile away, and were notoriously emotional bidders.\n“When they start to bid in smaller increments, it’s a sign that they’re coming to the end of their budget. So if they start bidding in increments of $5000 or $10,000, we continue bidding at $20,000.”\nFinally, patience is key: it takes most buyers up to six months to secure a property that is right for them.\nOriginally published as Real estate agents’ tricks exposed", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/25/1227456/387492-dfb295d4-31db-11e5-8823-ee8ddde1e807.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/home-buyers-guide-tricks-used-to-make-you-pay-more-and-how-to-avoid-them/story-fndban6l-1227456387572", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/25/1227456/387544-0dd2e9b8-31dd-11e5-8823-ee8ddde1e807.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/25/1227456/384964-1dd93b96-31dd-11e5-8823-ee8ddde1e807.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/25/1227456/385360-fd0354d2-31dd-11e5-8823-ee8ddde1e807.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-25T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T07:13:05.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
