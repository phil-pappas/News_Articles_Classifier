It's expected to be published Thursday in the Federal Register. \nGreenhouse gases are blamed for the climate warming that's reducing the polar bear's summer sea ice habitat. The effects of diminished sea ice are projected to lead to population declines throughout the century. \nScientists saw no rebound in population numbers in their research models, which stretched to the year 2100. \n  \nFILE - In this Nov. 6, 2007, file photo, a polar bear mother and her two cubs are seen in Wapusk National Park on the shore of Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba. About a third of the world's polar bears could face imminent threat from greenhouse gas emissions in as soon as a decade, according to a new report by the U.S. Geological Survey released Tuesday, June 30, 2015. The effects of diminished sea ice will lead to population declines throughout the century, and scientists didn't see a rebound in population numbers from the modeling that went up to the year 2100, according to the report.
