The museum would open as usual Wednesday, he said.\nThe attraction along San Diego’s seafront opened in 2004 and hosts as many as a million visitors a year. It has about 200 employees and 650 volunteers.\nThe Midway, among the largest ships in the world in its early years, was commissioned a week after World War II ended, was used throughout the Vietnam War, and was decommissioned after service in 1991’s Operation Desert Storm.\nIt now operates as a non-profit run by a board of directors.\nIn recent years it has been home to college basketball games, used for parties during the Comic-Con pop culture extravaganza, and hosted TV tapings for shows like ABC’s “The Bachelor.”\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:34:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
