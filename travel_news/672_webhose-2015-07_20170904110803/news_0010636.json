PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:00, Fri, Jul 10, 2015 NAANTALI SPA Naantali Spa in Finland \nWell ok, it has been since the early 1990s but a recent Instagram post showing American basketball player Amar’e Stoudemire doing it has highlighted its popularity. \nVinotherapy – it's official name I kid you not – has a number of health benefits including getting rid of cellulite and preventing wrinkles. Sold! \nSo it wasn't hard to pick my treatment from nearly 100 choices during my recent visit to the Naantali Spa in Finland. \nThe Galvagni Spa Wine treatment just sprung out of the menu screaming at me to indulge in it. \nTherapist Johannon began the treatment by lathering my whole body with a peel made of apricot seed powder and wine grape seed oil.

Forget drinking the stuff, bathing in red wine is the new 'in' thing \nCompletely covered with the thick but amazing smelling paste, I was made to sit in a jacuzzi bath with red wine extract to allow the concoction to work its magic. \nThe smell was divine and sent me straight to sleep and it was only when Johannon entered the room that I woke up. \nThe treatment is completed with lashings of body cream and a glass of white wine in hand. Total bliss. \nBut Naantali Spa has a lot more to offer. \nIt has no less than five different pools including an outdoor pool heated to 30 degrees so you swim all year round even when there’s a blanket of snow outside. \nThere’s also a gym, two Roman whirlpool baths, two Turkish and four Finnish saunas. \nSet on the edge of a seaside, the hotel makes full use of the views despite its size. \nA lot of the 251 rooms and suites have a sea view but it’s the spa residence in my opinion that has the greatest of views. \nUsed for timeshare and hotel use, these are incredibly spacious with a lounge area and kitchen and come with decent size balconies. \nThey are similar to modern apartments in a busy city without the hustle and bustle. \nThe ample open space both inside and out provides another place to unwind and relax just metres away from the main building.. \nFrom a buffet to sit down fine dining and a café to lobby bar, you’ll definitely not go hungry here. \nDepending on where you choose to eat, you can find contemporary Thai, Scandinavian and continental cuisine. \nThe food is simple but bold. The Le Soleil does a great grilled Salmon accompanied by potato gnocchi red curry and Asia salad. NAANTALI SPA The spa's bar \nFor wine aficionados there’s a wine cellar to explore as well as embark on a course to show off your skills at future dinner parties. \nWith so much to do it can prove hard to tear yourself away from the lap of luxury but it would be a shame not to see the old town with its traditional maritime charm, narrow streets, churches and museums. \nJust a short walk away, it will give you a real sense of its history, people and the history. \nA must visit is the president’s summer residence - a granite manor house on the shore of Naantalinlahti Bay surrounded by the Kultaranta Garden. \nThe tradition has been ongoing since 1922 and the gardens are open to guests for free. \nOh and how can you afford to miss Moominworld? \nThe theme park - based on the Moomin books by Tove Jansson - is situated on the island of Kailo beside the old town and near Turku. \nAnd if you really want to take a trip down memory lane you can take advantage of Nanntali Spa’s newly launched Moomin Package which includes accommodation for a family of four in one of the Moomin Story Rooms. NAANTALI SPA Naantali Spa has a range of treatments to offer \nJust 30 minutes away, Turku is in stark contrast to Naantali. \nOnce the capital of Finland, it’s now an important location for business and culture. \nOur tour guide Olga Henriksson told us that it came into existence during the end of the 13th century which makes it the oldest city in Finland. \nSadly its ambitions were dealt a death blow in 1827 when a fire destroyed most of the city. \nStill, there is plenty to see including an impressive castle, a cathedral and museums and shops. \nAnd there are many restaurants to suit everyone’s budget’s but Pinella is great place to go for a bit of a splurge. \nAround 160 years old, this landmark building is situated on the River Aura in the heart of city and although contemporary in its food offerings it still gives you that lovely cosy nostalgic feeling while dining and pondering over the offerings of this part of the world. \nNightly rates at Naantali Spa start from €69 per person on B&B basis based on 2 sharing, visit naantalispa.fi to book.
