The data was also reasonably equally divided between the genders, with 56.5% of the respondents male, 41.9% female and 1.6% identifying as “other”. \nThe average age of respondents was 33, with 79.1% fitting an ABC1 profile, and 64% matching an AB profile. \nAlthough just a snapshot of the overall market, the data revealed that the LGBT sector remains highly lucrative - both in terms of the number of holidays taken and the average spend of the sector on their breaks. The data also highlighted the huge potential for mainstream travel companies. \nSome 29% of respondents said they usually take an overseas holiday between three and four times a year, while 27.2% said they take one twice a year. Only 15.8% said they take a holiday once a year. Meanwhile, 12.3% said they typically enjoy a holiday five or more times per year. \nWith regard to booking these breaks, 36.3% said they had previously used an online travel agent, 25% said they opted for airline websites, while 23.6% use high street travel agents. Some 12.4% used an online discount site such as Lastminute.com. Just 2.2% used an LGBT specialist travel company. \nAs Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer later highlighted, it shows that the potential for mainstream travel firms to target the LGBT sector remains “huge”. Highly profitable \nIt can also be highly profitable: 27% of the respondents said they would spend £2,000 or more per person on their main holiday, while 38% would spend between £1,000 and £1,999. This compares with the national average spend of £650, which Abta estimates most people typically spend on their main holiday. A further 11% of the sector would spend £3,000 or more on their main break. \nKim Watson, media and marketing manager of Millivres Prowler Group, the company which publishes Gay Times and Diva, who presented the research, said that the sheer number of different cities, countries and regions that respondents had travelled to in the past 12 months or were planning to travel to, proved the diversity of the market. \n“For many years we’ve carried a lot of advertising and promotion for circuit parties and presumed our audience was very interested in partying, but that’s not necessarily so.” \n“Yes Spain, France, Greece and the US are very popular, but we also saw destinations like Costa Rica, Japan, Indonesia and the Dominican Republic,” she said. \nShe also advised travel businesses not to dismiss the potential of the lesbian travel market specifically. “The gay male market is often seen as a more attractive market to promote to but there is a high proportion of the audience of Diva magazine who are high-earning professionals interested in more expensive adventure holidays and so on,” she pointed out. Catering to diverse tastes \nLooking at the types of holidays topping the agenda of the respondents, 33% said they favoured beach holidays, 25% prefer to take a city break, while 11% voted in favour of cruising, which Celebrity Cruises UK and Ireland managing director Jo Rzymowska later acknowledged revealed the vast potential for the cruise industry to target the market. \nMeanwhile, contrary to popular belief, “party holidays” are not high on the agenda for the LGBT market, with only 1% revealing this is the kind of future holiday they are most interested in. Even Watson admitted this figure had shocked her. \n“This was a real surprise,” she said. “For many years we’ve carried a lot of advertising and promotion for circuit parties and presumed our audience was very interested in partying, but that’s not necessarily so.” \nInstead, romantic breaks topped the list of special occasions holidays - possibly as a result of the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the UK last year, and Ireland in May. Some 93% of the sector said they would want to celebrate a milestone anniversary or birthday as a future holiday, while 76% said they would want to book a honeymoon as a future holiday and 73% said they would choose a holiday to celebrate a proposal and/or engagement. \nIn terms of where respondents said they like to holiday, it’s worth noting that the LGBT sector remains concerned by destinations’ laws and stance towards LGBT people. \nSome 74% said they were influenced by countries’ attitudes to the sector, although as with most markets, 83% admitted they were more swayed by best price deals or offers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:39.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
