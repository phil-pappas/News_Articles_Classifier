Willy Kaemena, from Bremen in Germany, created the above panorama of the city, the Persian Empire’s first capital, founded by Darius the Great in 518 BC, following a holiday in April. The photographer worked in Iran 35 years ago – “before, during and after the Revolution” – and wanted to revisit to see how it had changed. The above image – one of a series taken around Iran (others include Shiraz, Pasagardae and Isfahan) – allows internet users to view up close the columns and stone terrace that make up Persepolis, a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1979. Tripods are not allowed inside the ruins, so Mr Kaemena lifted a monopod and swivelled it to take the four photographs needed to make a panoramic image. He said it took “only a few seconds” to capture the pictures, but that the digital “stitching” afterwards to create the 360° image took up to an hour. His images - all available to view on his website - are all the more interesting given that Google Street View – which allows internet users to roam the streets of North America and Europe – has not yet captured anywhere in Iran.

Isfahan (Photo: Willy Kaemena) He said that Persepolis had changed since his first visit to the site in the 1970s: “It is more touristy now – it was more natural back in the 1970s. It is just different.” Mr Kaemena's images capture mosques in intricate detal (Photo: Willy Kaemena) On his seven-day group tour, he also visited mosques, bazaars and bath houses in the famously beautiful city of Isfahan and in Shiraz, renowned for its gardens and as the resting place of Persian poets Hafez and Saadi. He took panoramic shots from the “Towers of Silence” in the desert city of Yazd, which were once used as a perch for dead bodies to be picked apart by birds before the remains were laid to rest. \"The panoramas of the mosques are my favourites as they are just so beautiful ,\" he said. Persepolis was burnt by Alexander the Great's forces in 330, but the structure of the site remains (Photo: Alamy) The Foreign Office still advises Britons against all but essential travel to Iran, but the country's tourism industry is likely to grow following this month's historic nuclear deal. Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, said last week that he hoped to reopen the British embassy in Tehran before the end of the year , which may facilitate leisure visits to the country. • Iran's travel highlights • Iranians 'more than eager' to welcome foreign tourists Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T22:58:33.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
