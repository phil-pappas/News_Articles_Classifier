The historic buildings charity — set up in 1965 by banker and philanthropist Sir John Smith and his wife Christian — turns 50 this year and there is much to celebrate.\nAfter starting off with only six buildings, it now owns or leases 194, from a pineapple-shaped folly to a smart pigsty, several castles and a Florentine palazzo, all buildings that had fallen into disrepair and were badly in need of love and care.\nOne of its biggest early acquisitions was Lundy Island, a wild rocky outcrop 12 miles off the Devon coast. The Trust acquired the lease in 1969, taking on the entire island as well as 40 or so buildings. It was the wish of Sir John, who died in 2007, that Lundy’s untamed character be safeguarded. So, no signs, no street lights, no mobile phones (in the pub, at least).\nLundy Island is a wild rocky outcrop 12 miles off the Devon coast that is inhabited by seagulls and skylarks\nThe gnarly island is exposed and getting here demands a strong stomach. Visitors arrive by MS Oldenburg (known affectionately as ‘MS Old-and-b d’), which can be a choppy passage.\nWhen I sail with my parents, the sea is moderate with a south-westerly force-four wind flicking us along. Pale souls are clutching sick bags, while the hardier sou’wester-clad crew are eating sandwiches; a band called Shake-a-Leg is singing sea shanties in between pints and I am watching the horizon, gulping the salty breeze.\nIt’s a two-hour trip from Ilfracombe in North Devon to Lundy (the boat sometimes departs from Bideford, too) and we are all relieved to dock.\n Wine and design: The quirky boutique vineyard in Chile that... EasyJet flight from Newcastle to Spain is forced to make... 'Look out for secret cave parties': Kiss FM DJ Charlie... Access all areas: The mindblowing 360-degree photographs of... Lundy can accommodate 94 visitors in all manner of properties — an old lighthouse, admiralty lookout, castle keep and elegantly proportioned 19th-century villa among them. For the extra hearty, there’s a campsite.\nWe’re in the Old Lighthouse, which has wonderful views and the ultimate terrace that houses the light. Like all Landmark properties, it is decorated sensitively — the window frames and doors painted Admiralty brown (a reddish, business-like shade) and the kitchen filled with blue and white-striped Cornish crockery.\nThere’s a dark and stormy shipwreck painting in the sitting room and P. D. James murder mystery The Lighthouse on the shelf. At night, the wind rattles the window panes and huffs down the chimney.\nThe mascot of the untamed island is a puffin as the word Lundy is Old Norse for puffin island\nThe electricity goes off at midnight, so bedtime reading requires a torch. Rather like boarding school, says dad. People come here to walk, climb, dive — and count the Lundy cabbages (it’s an area of Special Scientific Interest).\nWe are here because my father (an archaeologist) has wanted to visit for years. He went to the party to celebrate the Landmark Trust’s 25th (a very jolly affair, apparently) so it is fitting that we should arrive on Lundy 25 years later. He also loves birds and the island’s mascot is the puffin. Lundy is Old Norse for puffin island.\nVISITING LUNDY ISLAND MS Oldenburg operates between March 31 and October 23, sailing from Bideford or Ilfracombe, both Devon.\nBook tickets in advance via the Lundy Shore Office on 01271 863 636; adult return £62; aged 4–15 £30.50; under 4s £11.\nOld Light Upper sleeps five, prices start from £332 for four nights (01628 825 925, landmarktrust.org.uk ).\nNeedless to say, when we battle out in gusty weather to teeter on a cliff face with Dad’s binoculars, we spot only hosts of guillemots perched on a stack in Jenny’s Cove.\nThe attractive birds are jammed on to the ledges as if in an over-subscribed lecture theatre, while the puffins live on the patches of grass above. Below, the sea thrashes at granite cliffs that could have been cut by an angry sculptor.\nThere is an old battery on this side of the island, built in 1861 to warn off ships in fog. Gunners stationed here would fire cannon at regular intervals.\nMore than 200 vessels have come a cropper around Lundy, and Jenny’s Cove is named after a three-masted schooner ‘Jenny’ that was wrecked off it in 1797. The seals, at least, look relaxed lolling about in the currents.\nAfter battling across the island’s grassy interior, we’re grateful to hole up at the Marisco Tavern — Lundy’s only pub — which serves good, reasonably priced food like Soay lamb raised locally, and speciality ales.\nOf the flame-haired barmaid who caused such a stir in the Nineties when she had an affair with the farmer and then the married island manager, there is no sign.\nLundy Island can accommodate 94 visitors in an array of buildings, including the Old Lighthouse (pictured)\nAll have long since left, but you still can’t keep any secrets here, according to one local.\nWifi and phone signal are off message — so forget about Netflix. Leave your hairbrush and pack Scrabble instead. The parky sea air blows away the sturdiest do and even on a calm day, there’s a breeze. It’s noisy with the gulls crying constantly and skylarks singing their hearts out overhead.\nOn South West Point is a new landmark, a sculpture by Antony Gormley. It looks out to the spot where the Atlantic and Bristol Channel meet, as well as over a huge borehole. It casts an eery silhouette.\nFour other sculptures have been commissioned around the country to mark the trust’s 50th anniversary — in Aldeburgh, Suffolk; Dorset’s Kimmeridge Bay; the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland; and Lowsonford, Warks.\nEvery Landmark has a story and staying in one of these places is like being loaned the keys to the secret garden.
