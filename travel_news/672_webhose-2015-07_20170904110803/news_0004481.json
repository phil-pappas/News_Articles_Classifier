As part of this exciting new partnership, RIBA has curated ‘Unlock London : A City in Pictures’, an exhibition showcasing a stunning selection of 17 black and white images of London’s most iconic landmarks taken by leading architectural photographers from the 1930s through to the 1960s. The exhibition will be on display at Le Méridien Piccadilly’s Terrace Grill & Bar until 30th September. \nLe Méridien Piccadilly’s relationship with RIBA has its roots in Le Méridien’s Unlock Art™ programme, which offers guests complimentary access to forward-thinking cultural institutions around the world. These partnerships allow guests to explore a local, inspiring cultural experience, by presenting the ‘Unlock Art’ room key. During the year-long partnership, guests at the hotel will have access to unique and exclusive walking tours through some of London’s most renowned and architecturally compelling precincts between the hotel and RIBA. In addition, guests at Le Méridien Piccadilly will also enjoy discounts at all RIBA workshops, bookshops and food and beverage outlets as well as priority access to RIBA’s exhibitions and ‘Late Tuesdays’. To celebrate this new partnership, Le Méridien’s acclaimed Chef de Cuisine, Michael Dutnall, has created a special new afternoon tea inspired by the eras captured in the ‘Unlock London’ photographs. Highlights include the ‘Helen of Troy’ Orange and Poppy Seed Cake, considered to be the most beautiful cake of the 1930s and often compared to Helen of Troy – the world’s most beautiful woman, as well as the Carrot Cake with cream cheese topping, a dessert that enjoyed a renaissance during the latter part of the 1960s. Amongst the sweet treats on offer there is also the Traditional British Bakewell Tart, and Sherry Trifle. Sandwiches include Norfolk duck eggs and mustard cress; Scottish smoked salmon and chive cream cheese; Roast Surrey farm chicken with lemon and tarragon mayo; and Roasted Pepper and Rachel’s goats cheese. The Unlock London Afternoon Tea will be served Monday to Saturday at the Terrace Grill & Bar from 12.00pm to 6.00pm from 1st July to 26th September and costs £29 per person. In celebration of the exhibition Le Méridien Piccadilly has curated a British twist on the French75 cocktail with its London75. This refreshing summer beverage uses Sipsmith Gin with a delicious mixture of raspberries, ginger root, sugar syrup and lemon juice topped off with Chapel Down English sparkling wine and costs £7.
