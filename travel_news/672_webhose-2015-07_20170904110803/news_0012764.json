Surfing is a fun and sociable sport that you will never regret mastering. \nAre you looking for a holiday that will appeal to your entire family and be great fun as well? Exploring the possibilities of family activity holidays focusing on surfing might well be the answer. Awakening a sense of adventure, and sharing and learning new skills could result in the holiday of a lifetime, and something your children will remember forever. \nFor that holiday that is a little different with activities that you can all do together, learning to surf is a brilliant choice. \nSociable, Skilful and Fun \nSurfing has a host of positive side effects as well as being both challenging and exhilarating. It is also one of the most popular board sports in the world. Once you've mastered the skill of surfing, you can head out anywhere in the world to pursue this fast-paced sport. Learning this skill together on family activity holidays is a fantastic way to nurture family bonds. The combination of sand, sun and fresh air is completely invigorating and very addictive, and surfing teaches perseverance and endurance to all members of the family.Ancient culture \nSurfing is a very ancient sport originating in Hawaii; it is at least 1500 years old and perhaps even older. In Hawaiian society, surfing held an important place in the culture, demonstrating strength and agility. Competitions were held to find the strongest and most agile surfers, but as only the ruling royalty were able to use lighter and more buoyant wood for their boards, they usually won any competitions. With the arrival of missionaries and foreign immigrants, surfing had nearly disappeared from Hawaiian culture by 1890. Luckily, a few Hawaiians kept up the sport and in 1905 some teenagers formed the famous Beach Boys of Waikiki - and the rest, as they say, is history! \nLearn to Surf in Aquitaine \nSurfing is hugely popular today and many countries have beaches where you can surf, including the UK and around Europe. France has a long coast facing the Atlantic Sea, resulting in some spectacular waves, and there are many resorts in the southwest that are very well suited to surfers of all abilities. \nIf you're just starting out, however, Moliets du Maa, in Aquitaine, is perfect. There is a surf school where you can get lessons and hire out all the equipment you will need and it's a wonderful place for family activity holidays as there are also plenty of other sports on offer. If you want a bit of diversion from the beach, there is one of the best golf courses in France, and there are also some great cycling routes through the forest of Landes. Take a picnic and enjoy the dappled sunlight and invigorating trails as you explore this beautiful forest. \nYou can do so many things on this type of holiday that you'll never run the risk of being bored. Once learnt, surfing is like riding a bike â€“ you never forget how to do it (or so they say). Learning how to surf may give your children a lifelong interest in the sport and, if so, there are plenty of surfing festivals and competitions all over Europe and the UK has some good surfing beaches in the southwest. \nOnce you've experienced this type of holiday, you'll have your eyes opened to the huge variety of family activity holidays available. Your annual holidays will never be the same again!   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted family activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada.
