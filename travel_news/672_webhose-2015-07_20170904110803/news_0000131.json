His house, next to the winery, looks from the outside like a metal barn with windows, inside it’s a magical den of whimsical art and excentricity.\nAnd his winemaking philosophy is equally unconventional. He makes no-compromise wines, wines that are unappealing, even difficult, when young but have the potential for great depth and complexity as they age. They are the opposite of the opulent trophy reds that garner high ratings and three figure prices, but have no sense of place. These are serious, grown-up wines for the connoisseur rather than the nouveaux collector.\n“There are places in this country that can’t get enough Silver Oak (the celebrity California Cab), and if they try my wine next to Silver Oak and they don’t like it.”\nHis wines have always done well in Europe . This is not a surprise – they might be New World in their generous fruit but they are definitely Old World in terms of their structure, their tannins.\nHe prefers to source his fruit from the Horse Heaven Hills and Red Mountain AVA’s rather than the better known Walla-Walla.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T04:27:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
