Data gathered will be passed to scientists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \n“Monitoring and understanding what is happening on the reef and developing marine-managed areas is crucial to implement effective environmental management strategies and decide where to focus our efforts,” Mascetti said. \nThe property, which is situated on Dhidhoofinolhu island, recently received the Green Fins certification, which rewards diving centres for environmentally-friendly tourism activities and responsible behaviour by guest divers. \nLux Maldives’ Marine Biology Centre also organises projects and activities that guests can contribute to to raise awareness about marine conservation in the South Ari Atoll. \nResort general manager Shaun Dünhofen added: “We are proud to strengthen our support to local institutions and national research programmes to preserve, sustain and restore our reefs, which are home to an incredible array of wildlife.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:10:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
