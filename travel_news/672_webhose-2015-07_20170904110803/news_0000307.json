Doubling the venue`s event space to 7,000m2 and enhancing its technology capabilities has facilitated the return of many events as well as seen a significant increase of bookings from international associations. Even before Belfast Waterfront opens the doors to the new facility, it has already secured 50 conferences for 2016 to 2021, which will bring over 43,000 delegates to the city, generating a welcome 94,000 delegate days. \nTo ensure the growing demand for the new centre is met and additional opportunities are fully realised, its sales and marketing team has almost doubled in size. Susie McCullough joins the team from Tourism Northern Ireland, bringing a wealth of experience and invaluable knowledge to her new role as Director of Sales and Marketing. Susie will oversee all commercial activities to drive business growth and increase market share. As part of this, she will lead a team of 15, who collectively boast over 150 years in the events industry and have a proven track record in managing and winning prestigious events. Susie McCullough (Director of Sales and Marketing at Belfast Waterfront Conference and Exhibition Centre) comments: `This is a very exciting time to be heading up the sales and marketing team at Belfast Waterfront, especially in the run up to the opening of its new world class conference facility in Spring 2016. Today Belfast is one of Europe`s dynamic business destinations, and with the addition of a 7,000m2 high tech conference centre, we will see many more associations and business leaders choose the venue to showcase their achievements on a world stage. Awe inspiring flexible spaces, stunning riverside views and delicious cuisine create the perfect event space for individuals to connect with like-minded colleagues plus share valuable experiences and knowledge with peers.‚Äù Indeed the expansion programme will significantly increase the centre`s capability to host major national and international conferences. Going forward the team will focus on driving growth in these markets as well as corporate business. The recruitment of Aoife Glenn and Peter McCartney, as GB and International Conference Sales Executives, will further strengthen relations with an expanding international clientele. Whilst Kim Keightley, Exhibition and Business Sales Executive, is gearing up to sell 2,500m2 clear span space perfect for gala dinners and elaborate corporate events plus meeting rooms accommodating up to 200 delegates to local and national businesses. Key to supporting the centres` overall goals will be Lisa Turkington, the newly appointed Digital Marketing Executive responsible for devising multi-channel marketing strategies that will amplify the brand on an international level.The new recruits have hit the ground running, with Lisa pushing ahead with redesigning and reenergising the centre`s online presence. And out on the front line, Kim represented Belfast Waterfront recently at a UK Corporate Roadshow, revealing plans of the new conference centre to key customers during 3 days of nonstop events. Likewise Aoife is showcasing the latest 3d extension flythrough at the Meetings Show, this week.There`s no doubt the best is yet to come for Northern Ireland`s only purpose built conference centre.
