Though Cerf island is just a few minutes away from the main island of Mahe, and even if it provides a peaceful and conducive working environment, Seychellois people are still not showing interest in working there. \nAlong with the other points raised, Minister St.Ange has assured the hoteliers there that these issues will be brought to the concerned authorities so that these challenges can be alleviated. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
