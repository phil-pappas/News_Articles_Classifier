Slender dining carriages boasted white-gloved waiters in black tie, wine lists and even finger bowls to embellish a meal by rail. It was considered an upper-crust experience.\nClever entrepreneurs keen to ring the cash register picked up on this American longing for meals in motion and began prefabricating aluminium (“all-Um-in-Um” as Americans pronounce it) roadside eateries that resembled dining cars and railway carriages.\nThe idea is almost exclusively American and, although countless ma and pa diners have fallen to the wreckers’ ball, or made way for the Golden Arches, many still thrive as icons of the US roadside landscape.\nTight, tomato-red vinyl, spinning-chrome soda fountain stools and glowing neon are as American as apple pie … and a plate full of fries.\nThe waitresses on rollerskates are, sadly, almost all gone but at least the bottomless cup of coffee remains the rule, rather than the exception. Visit a diner at least once on a trip to the US. Sit at the counter, order a soda pop or take to a vinyl-covered booth and pop a dime, 10¢, into the table-side jukebox of rock and roll oldies.\nTo tackle even the tip of the “BLT” iceberg of the most iconic eateries in America would require volumes, but here is a “short stack” of the best bites for dining, diner-style. The locals are happy to share many more. And please remember, tipping is expected in the US.\nThough they’re a clone of the original, Lori’s Diners are all over the San Francisco Bay area and offer great fun served at good value. Nail down the burgers with Idaho-sized french fries, a malted or a famous ice- cream soda. A welcoming reception by the waitress to Lori's Diner cafe, Ghirardelli Square, San Francisco.

Lake Tahoe and the Truckee Diner in Truckee, California, sits on a railroad siding near Lake Tahoe Township.\nIt’s aluminium-sided and is well equipped to turn over some of the best club sandwiches and stacked-high pancakes in the county.\nThe Brooklyn Diner at Times Square in Manhattan is great fun. Cheeky wait staff add to the New York flavour and Jewish, Italian, Irish and other ethnic dishes sit well on the menu alongside more traditional fare.\nYou can still visit the original site in Brooklyn, but Times Square is easier to access. Listen closely and practise your “Neuw Uurk” accent here. The staff love a good laugh. Johnny Rockets Original Hamburger Diner, Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles.

We love the ones in the Venetian Casino, Las Vegas, and in the Hilton Hotel and casino in Reno, Nevada; all of them welcome children and provide the crayons.\nBob’s Big Boy of Burbank, California, is one of the last freestanding, neon-lit bastions of hot-rod cult and big handcrafted hamburgers. Don’t be surprised to find celebrities taking on board a colossal cholesterol count at the counter stools – the place has been used as a set for many Hollywood movies and the food is fine 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Locals still burn rubber in the palm-lined parking lot. Bob's Big Boy company logo outside their oldest restaurant in Burbank, California.

After devouring a dinner in Becky’s Diner, head for the best book store in the US, Powell’s. Bring the “doggie-bag” along for the walk.\nMel’s Drive-In at Sherman Oaks, California, is an all-aluminium aircraft fuselage from the earlier American Graffiti era.\nListen to late-night cops on the beat while drinking bottomless cups of coffee at the formica-topped counter. Take your coffee black.\nThe iconic other Mel’s is on Sunset Blvd, in West Hollywood, and stays open around the clock. Great for late night celebrity-spotting.\nWhile waiting for an order, check out the wall-hangings and fellow revellers, who just might be nocturnal animals of some notoriety.\nMickey’s Diner, in Saint Paul Minnesota, has been the backdrop for a few Midwestern film shoots and still manages to serve up great nostalgia and a nice pile of pancakes.\nBig on Midwest value for money, Mickey’s also still makes its milkshakes and malts by hand.\nGO2\nDINER SERVICE\nLori’s Diners\nTruckee Diner\nBrooklyn Diner\nJohnny Rocket’s\nBob’s Big Boy\nMel’s Drive In\nMickey’s Dining Car\nMORE\ndiscoveramerica.com/foodstories.com\ntheamericanroadside.com", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/522513-b3246ea2-25e2-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/520705-b44fee28-25e2-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg", "http://discoveramerica.com/foodstories.com", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/17/1227445/517461-b20ca19c-25e2-11e5-b856-d650f72d3e25.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-19T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:57:15.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
