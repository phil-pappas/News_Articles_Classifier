Sky News 10 Jul 2015 News Flights cancelled ... and Denpasar airport closed. Picture of Alex Pace. Picture: Michael Ross Source: News Corp Australia \nJETSTAR tonight cancelled another four flights to and from Bali tomorrow ahead of further assessments in the morning. \nAs the airline copped an outpouring of anger on social media, Jetstar Australia and New Zealand CEO David Hall said the situation which has left thousands of Australians stranded was “extremely regrettable”. \n“We share our customers’ frustrations with the situation to Bali,” said Mr Hall. \n“It’s extremely regrettable that our customers’ holidays have been spoiled by these disruptions and that we can’t provide the certainty we would like to due to the unpredictability of the volcanic ash cloud surrounding this airport.” \nHe indicated Qantas may join Jetstar in providing additional services to clear the backlog of passengers once the ash cloud cleared. \n“We have teams working around the clock, monitoring conditions in Bali and assisting customers as best we can in these trying circumstances,” Mr Hall said. \nBali’s Ngurah Rai International Airport is expected to reopen at 8am (EST), conditions permitting. \nJetstar and Virgin Australia have cancelled dozens of flights for the last three days due to the volcanic ash from Mount Raung, 150km from Denpasar. Eruptions are continuing but a wind change is expected to allow the airport to reopen. \nFour other airports, including the international airport on neighbouring Lombok island, were also shut late yesterday as Mount Raung in East Java province spewed clouds of ash, transport ministry spokesman J.A. Barata said. \n“This is for safety,” he said, adding officials were checking the situation every few hours but they did not know yet when the airports might reopen. \nAuthorities raised the alert status of Mount Raung, a 3300-metre volcano, late last month to the second highest level after it began to spew lava and ash high into the air. The smoke and ash from Indonesian volcano Mount Raung ... It began erupting last week causing chaos and cancellation of flights to and from Bali. Picture: Instagram photo by @tanandsmiley (Tanya Sandow) Source: Instagram \nSenior meteorologist at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, Stephanie Bond, said the last time Mount Raung erupted, it continued to erupt for many weeks. \n“The volcano is continually emitting ash and the winds are staying in the same direction,” said Ms Bond. \n“For the foreseeable future there won’t be any reprieve. Winds generally move due to weather systems, and there’s no strong driver of winds in the area.” \nBali is a favourite holiday destination for Australians. Crowds of foreign tourists were stranded at Bali’s Ngurah Rai airport, waiting for further information about their flights. Indonesia’s flag-carrier Garuda said it had cancelled a total of 112 flights. \nVirgin Australia and Jetstar had already cancelled flights in and out of Bali in recent days because of the volcanic ash, even before the airport was fully closed. \nAir New Zealand said a flight due to depart from Bali on Saturday afternoon had been rescheduled to leave early on Sunday, conditions permitting. \nOther airports closed by the ash included a second, smaller one on Lombok and two in East Java serving domestic routes.

Source: News Corp Australia \nJetstar said the airline is offering a range of options to accommodate changes to travellers’ plans. \nThe Insurance Council of Australia has advised travellers to confirm the compensation or alternative arrangement details of their travel insurance policies. \nBoth Jetstar and Virgin have said there will be additional flights between Australia and Bali as soon as conditions improve. \nVirgin customers can change their booking to another flight within 14 days at no extra charge or receive a full travel credit. Virgin is advising customers to call 13 67 89 to rearrange their bookings. \nMt Raung erupted on July 2. The volcano is about 150km to the west of Denpasar airport in East Java, the main airport for those heading to Bali. \nThe latest round of cancellations began on Wednesday evening. Jetstar has so far been unable to consider flying any passengers out of Bali because it has no aircraft there. \nA spokesman said the airline had to first fly passengers to Bali, before it could fly anyone home. \nA Virgin spokeswoman said it was hard to predict weather conditions and the airline was keeping a close eye on the situation and taking advice from the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre based in Darwin.

But they faced at least another day in Bali after Denpasar airport was closed. \nThey told AAP that they were desperate to get home as Mrs McNulty has run out of medication and Mr McNulty needs to work. They weren’t able to claim the costs under their travel insurance and were borrowing money from friends. \n“My husband’s self-employed, we might have to end up declaring bankruptcy now because things have got that bad,” Mrs McNulty said. \n“This has just financially ruined us really.” \nMr McNulty said they pleaded with Jetstar to prioritise them for medical reasons, but nothing worked. \n“It’s turning out to be the Bali holiday from hell basically,” he said. \n“We love the Balinese people, but we’ll probably never come back as a result of the debacle of the airlines. \n“I realise they’ve got to put the safety of passengers first, but the actual way they’ve been so quiet and not let us know is just devastating. \n“It’s not good enough, we paid good money to board these flights and the least they could do is look after us when they make so much money.” \nAir Asia and Garuda Indonesia continue to fly between Australia and Bali via other Bali airports. \nrobyn.ironside@news.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T13:23:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
