Probably best known as the setting of the ice car chase in James Bonds Die Another Day , the lagoon is a top summer and winter destination and easily doable in your own time from Reykjavik. \nThis is where the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier falls off into the water to leave huge chunks of ice floating towards a narrow isthmus and the road. You can watch the action on a summer cruise of the lagoon, though seeing it in winter is also impressive as the lagoon is literally filled with ice chunks. \nPeople do Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon on tours, but it is much better to go along with a self-drive, since you can stop off at any of the myriad attractions along the way. The journey is very straightforward as it goes along Route 1 all the way from Reykjavik. \nIt can be done on a daytrip from Reykjavik, but theres no point in rushing as there are loads of sights on the way, plus you could overnight in nearby Höfn. To incorporate Jökulsárlón as part of a wider sightseeing trip, consider writing up an itinerary that also takes in the Golden Circle attractions and maybe Skaftafell and some of the other places en route. \nFarther down into south Iceland is the Eyjafjallajökull glacier, which is associated with the nearby volcano that erupted in recent times. There are also many beautiful waterfalls in this region, while bird lovers have the Dyrhólaey headland. You could then hole-up for the night in Vik and make a side trip to the Reynisdrangar pinnacles. \nWhen you get to Jökulsárlón, many visitors opt for a cruise on the lagoon. These go out during the summer months where you get to dodge the bergs and try to spot seals. The cruises are typically amphibious vehicles, which drive right into the water from the nearby office. \nBlue Car Rental has the best self-drive tour options for trips to Jökulsárlón, with all type of vehicles available and great rates.
