I'm always playing with toys and apps that help improve the passenger experience. Below are six tech tools I never travel without.\nBrydge iPad keyboard. Photo courtesy of Brydge 1. Brydge iPad Keyboard This Bluetooth-enabled keyboard turns your iPad into a mini computer. I upload work on my Docs To Go app and can get stories and blog posts written in the airport and on my flight. And the keyboard holds a charge for several months if you don't use the built-in speaker. More »\n2. Mophie Powerstation Duo I don't know how I lived without this power pack. With an amazing 6000mAh battery capacity,Mophie allows me to charge my iPhone and my iPad quickly on the go. I have actually charged phones for my fellow travelers 35,000 feet in the air. More »\n3. RFID Blocking Passport Holder After my passport expired in 2010, I ended up getting the new one that includes an RFID chip.

Google the title to see the myriad products offered.\n4. Noise Canceling Headphones If I had $300.00 lying around, I'd spring for a pair of Bose noise canceling ear buds . But since I don't, I never leave home without the Sharper Image noise canceling headphones my daughter bought me for my first Mother's Day. It's inevitable that there will be a screaming child or other noisy distractions, and these headphones block the noise quite effectively.\n5. Taylor Digital Luggage Scale With the airlines ready to charge travelers for overweight baggage, I now use this very accurate scale I bought at Target to weigh my luggage before a flight and before I depart from home. This scale could save you a nice chunk of change. For example, while Southwest Airlines allows you to check two bags for free, if that bag is one ounce over 50 pounds, you will be paying $75. This scale pays for itself before your first trip. More »\n6. Universal Adapter For those of you who travel outside the United States, remember when you had to carry different adapters for different countries? Well, those days are over, thank goodness. Thanks to universal adapters, you can take one small item that handles outlets from Great Britain to South Africa.\nShare ", "external_links": ["http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/index.jsp", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/L/x/F/Brydge.jpg", "http://www.mophie.com/shop/powerstation-duo-smart-phones-tablets", "http://www.target.com/p/taylor-digital-luggage-scale-silver/-/A-11209475", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/x/F/Brydge.jpg", "http://www.southwest.com/html/customer-service/travel-fees.html?int=GNAVTRAVELFEES"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:40:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
