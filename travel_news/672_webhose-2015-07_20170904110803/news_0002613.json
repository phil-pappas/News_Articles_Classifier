Madame Tussauds Orlando is teaming up with Macy’s for a special social media contest that kicked off July 6 where 15 One Direction fans will receive makeovers from Macy’s and be among the first to meet the One Direction figures ahead of the public. Starting July 8, One Direction fans will be able to take photos and get up close and personal with their favorite band member. The figures are in a seated position on bleachers, so fans can interact with the entire group.
