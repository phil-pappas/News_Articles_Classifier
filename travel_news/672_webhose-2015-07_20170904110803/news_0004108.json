It’s a real old fashioned summer fair: from the 4-H animals and gardening/baking displays, to the amusement rides and games and musical entertainment for the whole family. And don’t forget all of the delicious fair food.“That’s the beauty of the Grays Harbor County Fair,” said Mike Bruner, Grays Harbor Fairgrounds and Tourism Manager. “We welcome visitors from throughout the state looking for that real fair experience. And it’s a great value, as our general admission ticket provides access to just about everything at the Fair. We truly believe the Fair is Country Pride, County Wide fun.”Fair admission includes free general admission seating for a variety of country, pop and rock entertainment on the Pepsi Stage. This year’s lineup includes the original Eagles tribute band Hotel California on Aug. 5 (presented by the Vaughan Company); Corey Daniels and Humptulips on Aug. 7 (presented by Q-Mart) and Bon Jovi tribute band Steel Horse on Aug. 8.While maintaining the traditional fair feel, the Grays Harbor County Fair also mixes in modern attractions, to create a balanced feel that appeals to just about anyone who enjoys a day at the fair. Top main stage entertainment is just one example.Chart topping country stars Parmalee will headline a special show Aug. 6 (presented by Bigfoot Country 107.3 and Horns and Hooks Outdoors) with reserved seats for $25 which includes admission to the Fair. General admission seating is also available for Parmalee and is free with fair admission.The raceway will roar with car racing on Aug. 9 at 5 p.m. – a Grays Harbor County Fair tradition – free with paid admission to the Fair, and sponsored by Grays Harbor Raceway.All of the family favorite activities are back, including the Predators of the Heart educational wildlife exhibit, Professor Bamboozie, comic/magician Louis Foxx on the Jodesha Kids’ Zone Stage and the Home Depot Kids Building Workshops. And of course, all of the popular animals, floral, garden and food displays throughout the grounds.“Our visitors tell us the displays are some of the most popular parts of the Fair,” said Bruner. “It’s a tradition with many families to enter their baked goods or floral designs – from generation to generation – for judging. It’s a big part of the Fair.”General admission tickets are priced at $10 for adults, $6 for seniors and $6 for students 6-15 (kids 5 and under are free). The Fair will also honor current and former military service members’ families with a $2 military discount throughout all five days of the Fair.
