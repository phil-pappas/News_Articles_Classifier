See Pictures of Granada . \nThe coastal cities: \nCadiz - Check out the big Carnival in February. Go for two or three days, unless the beach mesmerizes you. \nGibraltar - Worth a day for a visit with our ancestors, but just. Bring your Pounds Sterling, it's British. \nMalaga - Hang with the jet set on the Costa del Sol. \nMotril - Stay in a cute place on the beach while visiting the likes of Alpujarras , a string of mountain villages worth visiting. \nJerez - Like Sherry?
