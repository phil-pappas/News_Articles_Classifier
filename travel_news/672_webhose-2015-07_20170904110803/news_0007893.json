Clever dog named Rosie uses plastic... I can feel the beat! Sleeping toddler springs to life and... Curious sloth appears to take SELFIE after holding onto the... Who needs enemies? Prankster powers up CHAINSAW and holds it... Throughout the video it is difficult to track the progress of the dog due to the fact that it is submerged under the water.\nBut after the second wave passes, the outline of the pooch – struggling to keep its head above water – becomes visible.\nThe first wave crashed into the dog and dragged it out to sea alongside the jagged rocks of the cliff\nThe second wave hit the dog and carried it further out to sea while submerging it under the water\nThe dog appears to be disorientated and in a panic begins paddling off in the wrong direction.\nIt is at this moment that a tourist – who witnesses the incident taking place – swims out to the animal’s location to rescue it.\nAs he approaches, the dog remarkably appears to understand the man’s intentions and actually swims towards him.\nThe tourist then scoops the dog up under his arm and begins heading back to the cliffs with it before lifting it up to another man who places it back on the rocks.\nThe outline of the dog - struggling to keep its head above water - was barely visible after the two waves had passed\nThe tourist swam out to the dog, who rather remarkably, paddled over towards him so that it could be rescued\nThe video concludes with the dog – still disorientated by the incident – hobbling over towards a woman who reaches out to give it a stroke.\nSince being posted to YouTube, the video has received a number of comments from people impressed by the quick reactions of the tourist.\nUser Dan Quote: : 'Just awesome. As they say, faith in humanity restored.'\nWhile Viki said: 'We need more people like this to world.'\nThe tourist managed to scoop the dog up under his arm and swam with it to a man standing on the cliff side\nThe video concluded with the disorientated dog walking towards a woman on the cliff side and being petted", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1Jxt0mi"], "published": "2015-07-22T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:42:20.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
