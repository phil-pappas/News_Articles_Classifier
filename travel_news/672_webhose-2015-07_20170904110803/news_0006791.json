Here are two possibilities that are a bit out of the ordinary. Duchamp Hotel Healdsburg's Duchamp Hotel is in an unlikely location, tucked behind Shed in downtown Healdsburg. But an offbeat wine country oasis awaits behind those walls. A pool and lounge chairs are surrounded by olive trees. Each room is its own little villa, with a patio out front. And quirky 20th-century art abounds. \nOwners Pat and Peter Lenz -- of Duchamp Winery -- opened the six-room boutique hotel in 1997 as a retreat, named it for artist Marcel Duchamp and filled the place with art, including some distinctly quirky pieces. A pink poodle greets guests in the lobby, and a large rocking chair sports a tractor seat. Rooms: In each \"villa,\" French doors open up to a large, airy room with high ceilings and polished concrete floors. There's a cozy day bed with a faux leopard fur throw, a flat-screen TV and an electric fireplace that operates with the flick of a switch. The mini bar is stocked with local wine ($36-$60). Advertisement Zzz's: We slept well in the supercomfortable platform king bed, with crisp white linens, a down-filled duvet and lots of fluffy pillows. Splashes: The luxuriously large bathroom boasts double sinks, a stainless steel counter and a huge open shower with side nozzles. We found stacks of fluffy white towels, bathrobes and Aveda bath and body products. Extras: Grab a tray and enjoy your wine country breakfast -- bowls of fresh fruit, yogurt, goat cheese, dates and pastries -- poolside or on your villa's patio. Also included: Wi-Fi and in-room bottled water, coffee and tea. Details: $375-$450 per night. 421 Foss St., Healdsburg; www.duchamphotel.com . Grape Leaf Inn This charming Queen Anne house, with a veranda and rose garden, lies just a few blocks away from Healdsburg square. Twelve rooms are tucked under the eaves and into secluded corners. Guests mingle in the spacious living room each afternoon, sipping wine from one of the local wineries owned by Grape Leaf Inn proprietor Wilson Artisan Wines. \nBut the highlight of any stay here has to be the speak-easy. Hidden behind a lobby bookshelf, a staircase leads to a cozy bar where bartender Nikkie Aloitta crafts Honey Lemon Whiskey Sours ($11.50) and Healdsburg Mules ($12.50), made with Sonoma Brothers vodka, ginger beer, lime and, in a twist, local apple juice. The rooms: Each room is named for a grape varietal, and the rooms vary considerably. There are small cozy rooms and spacious suites. Some rooms have fireplaces; others have bay windows, stained glass or skylights. Zzz's: You'll find queen, king, four-poster and sleigh beds here, covered in fluffy duvets and plush pillows. Splashes: The bathrooms vary as much as the room decor, so you'll find layouts ranging from basic sink and shower to double-vanity and bathtubs. Extras: House-made breakfast of fruit and breakfast tortillas, fresh-baked cookies and afternoon wine tasting. Details: Rates $265-$395. 539 Johnson St., Healdsburg; www.grapeleafinn.com . -- Mary Orlin, Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T00:33:58.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
