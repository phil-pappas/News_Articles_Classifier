Source: Getty Images\n“We certainly haven’t taken England lightly and we knew they were going to come out and be tough to beat in these conditions and now we’ve just had a real taste of that.\n“The advantage and the positive for us is we’re only four days away from the second Test.\n“I think that’s a good thing for this team.\n“All the boys now, like losing to New Zealand in the World Cup gave us a bit of a kick up the backside, they’ll probably see this game very similar.\n“This gives us a bit of a kick up the backside and we look forward to the second Test match.”\nClarke admits had Joe Root’s edge through to Brad Haddin gone to hand when England were in major trouble at 3-43 on day one – the entire course of the Test match could have changed.\nThe Poms celebrate their big win. Source: AFP\nHowever, the skipper said there could be no blame levelled at Haddin whatsoever because Australia had the rest of the Test match to make up for the mistake and failed.\nHe said in fielding, bowling and batting – Australia failed on every count.\n“If we hung onto our catches it could have been a whole different story,” he said.\n“But it’s not just about one catch. I’ve played this game long enough to know that you get to bowl to the other players, you get more opportunities to bowl to the guy you dropped, you get a chance to walk out and bat as well twice.\n“(Root) went on and made a good hundred and played really well but I think our standard in the field has been exceptional over the past couple of years.\n“We’ve caught really well. Sometimes you drop them and sometimes you pay for it. In this case we’ve paid for it.”\nHow the Aussies could have done with Ryan Harris. Source: Getty Images\nWatson went wicket-less in the match and failed to kick on with starts during both of his visits to the crease.\nIt’s an all-too common story for the 34-year-old all-rounder, as was the fact he fell both times lbw – to make it an astonishing 29 times out that way for his career.\nClarke said Watson’s demeanour remained strong.\n“I think Watto is doing what Watto does. Working extremely hard to try and be successful,” said Clarke.\n“Shane is an extremely hard worker, he wants to have success like the rest of us.\n“I think it’s the hardest part of this game - the longer you play the more ups and downs you go through.\nShane Watson dismissed LBW again against England 0:38 Play video\nShane Watson dismissed for LBW for the 14th time in 35 innings against England.\nFox Sports 12 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes/Highlights\n“When things aren’t going to plan you’ve got to stick to your processes, work hard, cop a few smacks on the chin and keep backing your own ability.\n“I think that’s exactly what Watto is doing.\n“He’s been a big part of the Australian cricket team in all three formats and has had a lot of success as well.”\nOriginally published as Clarke: this gives us a kick up the backside", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/the-ashes-2015-michael-clarke-draws-world-cup-parallels-as-aussies-look-to-bounce-back/story-fni2fnmo-1227438630790", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/12/DVU_1207_CRI_WATSON_LBW_AGAIN.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/631624-344388d0-280c-11e5-861d-74fbdd512b6e.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/631596-2b5a4e7a-280c-11e5-861d-74fbdd512b6e.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/630736-12d8aa86-280c-11e5-861d-74fbdd512b6e.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/12/1227438/630762-19361738-280c-11e5-861d-74fbdd512b6e.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-12T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:25:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
