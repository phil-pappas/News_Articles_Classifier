In recent days, the media have reported a shortage of medical supplies in Greece.” \nThe country’s travails have again dominated the headlines over the weekend, with negotiators only this morning agreeing a new bail-out package to stop it going bust, potentially as early as mid-week. \nInstead, Francis said the government should focus on the positives of travelling to the country too, adding: “One of the best things we can do to support Greek people is to continue to travel to the country, however the tone of the messaging and advice from the UK government, and subsequently the mass media, completely contradicts this. \n“The government of course has a duty to advise its citizens, but the information is given out-of-context, deterring travellers with little thought given to the negative impact on the Greek tourism industry. \n“Although we are not being told explicitly to not visit, the messages being sent to the UK public is clear – a trip to Greece will be more trouble than it’s worth. \n“Tourists couldn’t be more welcome than they are now – the Greek people need them to keep travelling – and it’s this which underpins our travel advice, alongside the practical tips and considerations as put forward by the FCO, and by our members on the ground in Greece.” \nChristos Panagiotopoulos, general director of responsibletravel.com member and Greek-based Arkas Travel said: “We never heard of any incident with tourists, or any problems with supplies. \n“In contrast I would say that during this time, we the Greeks understand that we need tourism more than ever. Tourism is the strongest column of our economy and we do our best to support it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T07:16:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
