A NEW LOOK FOR THE LANESBOROUGH IN LONDON The Lanesborough in the Knightsbridge neighborhood in London was one of the city’s top luxury hotels when it closed its doors in December 2013 for a renovation. Now, following a nearly $100 million makeover, it will reopen on July 15 for overnight guests. The refurbishment sticks to the elegant Regency-style décor the 93-room property has been known for since it opened in 1991, and was led by Alberto Pinto, the well-regarded interior design studio. Guest rooms have new period-style wood furniture and silk fabrics but also emphasize technology, according to the managing director, Geoffrey Gelardi. “We wanted to stick to our original aesthetic but also want to feel modern,” he said. See More » To his point, each room has three Sony Xperia Z2 tablets — one on either side of the bed to control temperature and lights and a third on the desk where guests can view amenities, order room service and make housekeeping requests. If the room lights are off, night lights automatically turn on when guests’ feet touch the floor, and room keys have long-range readers that unlock doors from several feet away — even if they’re in a pocket or handbag. Public spaces including the cigar bar were also redone with new furnishings, and the restaurant Céleste is under the direction of the three-Michelin-starred chef Eric Fréchon from France and his protégé Florian Favario. Rates from £715 (about $1,085) a night. COOKING AND TASTINGS AT A MENDOZA RESORT Argentina’s wine region of Mendoza is a popular tourist destination during the country’s warm-weather months from November through March, but Cavas Wine Lodge, a Relais & Châteaux property at the foothills of the Andes, has an offer to also lure in travelers during the mild winters. From July 1 through Sept. 14, guests who make a reservation get several extras, including a cooking class with the hotel chef featuring Argentine specialties like grilled steak with chimichurri sauce, a tasting of locally produced olive oils, a sunset bird-watching excursion, a pruning lesson in the 55 acres of on-site vineyards, and a dessert and sparkling wine pairing. Rates from $390 a night.
