While Priyanka Chopra spoke out for the right of celebs to recycle their clothes back in 2012, we can’t really say the ‘taboo’ of ­re-doing an outfit is ­completely gone. But, if the Duchess of Cambridge is not afraid of doing it, why should our Bollywood divas be? Kangana Ranaut recently ­re-wore a Vivienne Westwood dress that she was last ­spotted in three years back, and this time, she changed her styling to go with the current fashion mood. Here’s a glimpse at some who are not afraid of giving their favourite outfits another spin. \nKate Middleton \nThe Duchess does it fearlessly, royally repeating her outfits and even a pair of famous nude heels that she has already worn with myriad outfits. One dress that she has taken for a spin thrice is the deep emerald Jenny Packham gown that she debuted in 2013, and then wore twice in 2014, styling it with her baby bump on the final outing. Always event perfect, third time was indeed a charm for Kate when she pulled back her hair in an updo during the NYC Gala in December, letting her stunner strands of diamonds and ­emeralds stand out. \nKeira Knightley \nIf you want to do bridal like Keira, all you need is the panache to press re-play like a boss. For her wedding in 2013, Keira wore a snow white Chanel dress that she had been spotted in a few years back. A customised jacket on top and a pair of ­killer shades later, Keira made for a kickass bride! \nKangana Ranaut \nFrom wearing the checkered dress to a book launch to now recycling it for her travels, Kangy wore the Westwood number ­recently by ditching heels for oxfords and picking up a jacket to make it airplane travel-perfect. The hair was also less fierce, as the cateyes gave way to oversized tortoise shell frames. So, 2012 or 2015? We actually prefer the more casual spin of the dress’s second coming, especially the cute ­devil-horn buns with which she topped her look.
