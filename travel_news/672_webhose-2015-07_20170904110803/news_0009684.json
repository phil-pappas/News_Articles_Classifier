But as lines continue to blur between women and men’s fashion, flower power has emerged as a huge trend in menswear this year.From Gucci’s latest collection that showcased jackets with floral motifs for men, to Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh, who is often seen sporting floral prints — the style is no longer restricted to one gender.“Flowers are really big this season. Today, men don’t fear wearing floral prints or even bright colours. I guess it’s about coming into your own,” says designer Manish Malhotra, whose latest collection featured an eclectic range of bandhgalas and sherwanis with floral embroidery on them. Designer Komal Sood, who has used floral elements in her menswear designs, feels that this change is a result of the fact that men are far more comfortable experimenting with new trends, patterns and silhouettes now.“The trend has become more mainstream. I feel this experimentation also has a lot to do with the growth of the menswear industry, not only in India, but also globally. From the primary focus being on bespoke and tailor-made pieces — which showcased a certain finesse and craftsmanship — the thought process has changed to developing more alternatives other than the standard plaids, checks and solids,” says Sood.This year, several spring/summer menswear lines, including collections by designers like Vivienne Westwood, Antonio Marras, Louis Vuitton and Valentino, and closer home, that of designers Sabyasachi and Ken Ferns, among others, have explored floral prints in diverse ways. However, it is important to not follow the trend blindly. “Men need to take care of the kind of patterns they opt for. Very big floral patterns might not suit all personality types,” says designer Ridhi Mehra. Sood offers a similar suggestion, saying, “Floral prints should not look busy.” Style it right While such prints can be used on a variety of cuts and silhouettes, designers suggest some cuts that accentuate the design Lightweight resort wear fluid line shirts Sherwanis and formal blazers, if the print is not very bold Floral-printed trousers or shorts for a casual do A crewneck T-shirt Classic shirts with either mandarin or button down collars work well as a smart casual option­— With inputs from designer Anupama Dayal Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T20:21:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
