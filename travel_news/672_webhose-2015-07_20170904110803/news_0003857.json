I had booked a room at the Sheraton in Pleasanton, Calif. When I discovered that I would not be able to make it to the hotel, I called to ask if they would allow me to cancel due to the flight delay. I was advised that they would not, so I told them to keep my reservation open, and that I would be arriving late.\nI ended up reaching the hotel around 10:00 a.m. the next morning and thought that at least I could shower before going to meet my client, since this was an hour before the standard check-out time.\nI was informed that since I had not checked in, my room had been given to someone else, and the hotel had no room for me. I asked if I could get a refund, since I did not get a room. The clerk replied that since I did not cancel before the 24-hour deadline, I would not get a refund. I accepted this and asked that at least I receive Starwood Preferred Guest points for the amount charged, and credit for the stay I paid for. I was told that since I did not stay, I could not get those either. Can you help?\n—Neeraj Nigam\nAnswer: No room, no refund, no stay credit, no points—a whole lot of nothing added up to a tremendous amount of frustration for Nigam, who vowed to skip Sheratons in the future and switch his loyalty to other hotel chains instead.\nSheraton is one hotel brand of Starwood Hotels and Resorts. Starwood says it makes efforts to proactively take action when situations affect large numbers of guests, for example, severe weather that forces multiple flight cancellations, or widespread flooding.\n\"That said, it is not a standard policy and is at the hotel's discretion whether to waive the cancellation policy associated with a reservation,\" says Starwood representative Jessica Doyle.\nWhen a single guest such as Nigam is affected by a flight delay, the hotel may decide to waive the penalty, refund the deposit or offer a gesture of goodwill, according to Doyle. Communication is key: Guests who don't contact the hotel and simply don't arrive are charged a no-show penalty.\nNigam indicated he was told that he could not cancel his reservation. The hotel shared a different perspective, according to Doyle. The hotel agent thought Nigam indicated he might still be able to make it to the hotel, even if late at night, so the agent advised him to keep the reservation rather than cancel it.\n\"If he had insisted on canceling it, our understanding is that this would have been done free of charge,\" says Doyle.\nSince Nigam didn't, or couldn't, cancel, depending on who you ask, his room should have been available when he arrived, whatever the hour. It wasn't, and Doyle says the hotel indeed made a mistake: The agent who took Nigam's call did not protect his reservation all night, so the system eventually marked him a no-show. Another associate was then able to cancel his booking and give his room to someone else.\nNigam had booked his Sheraton room with a credit card, which afforded him certain protections. Starwood's policy is to hold such rooms until check-out time the following day. At the Sheraton in Pleasanton, that's 12:00 p.m., so Nigam should have been able to show up any time before noon and claim his room.\nWhen a hotel gives away a guaranteed room, the lodging industry standard requires the hotel to find new accommodation for displaced guests, pay for the first night's accommodation, and pay for transportation to the new hotel. The hotel should also pay the cost difference for the original booking versus the new rate, if applicable.\nNigam received no such offer, though given that he had two hours between his arrival time and check-out, it was hardly practical to find him new accommodation.\nAdding insult to injury, Nigam learned that although he was charged $250 for his room, he wouldn't earn Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) points on that amount, nor would he earn credit for the stay that would propel him to elite frequent-guest status. You have to physically stay in the hotel to earn perks. SPG gold and platinum tier elites get 4:00 p.m. late check-out times, a bonus that may have come in handy for Nigam.\nI sent Nigam's complaint to Starwood. A representative swiftly contacted him, refunded his $250 and credited 10,000 SPG points to his account.\nHow can you avoid trouble?\n• Know the cancellation policy. Be sure to read the details before finalizing your booking so you're not caught by surprise. Be aware also that the rules may change if you book through a third-party site. Many such bookings are prepaid, and while some sites may simply pass along a hotel's cancellation policy, others might have their own restrictions. Guests typically have to work with the site they booked through, not with the hotel directly, which may confuse the process.\nUSA TODAY\nNo refund? But I just made the reservation!\n• Contact your hotel right away if you're delayed. You might be able to cancel your reservation, depending on the hotel policy and your circumstances.\n• Ask the hotel to protect your booking if you're going to be very late. This will prevent you from being labeled a no-show, and ensure you'll have a place to go if you arrive in the wee hours.\n• Cultivate elite frequent-guest status. Some programs grant late check-out to high-status guests, so you'll have more time to enjoy your room once you finally arrive.\nMORE: Read previous columns\nDo you have a travel consumer issue you'd like Traveler's Aide to pursue?
