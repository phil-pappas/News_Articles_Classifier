Source: News Limited\nWhile the study was conducted in the northern US state of Michigan, David explains that Australia’s more temperate climate and higher electricity prices mean that there are probably even much lower gains possible in terms of saved energy. “Especially in cities like Melbourne, Sydney or Adelaide and Perth. Most of these don’t have a huge need for airconditioning on an annual basis either,” he says.\nHowever, Martin Kushler of the American Council for an Energy Efficient America argued that the study was too narrow and the results have been blown out of proportion. In a blog post analysing the study , he claimed that several national studies have previously examined other residential energy efficiency programs across many US states and have found them to be highly cost effective.\nEnergy Efficiency Council chief executive officer Luke Menzel said Australian households used a lot more energy than they needed to, but the good news was that Australian families could make big gains by taking straightforward actions.\n“Research has shown that some of the cheapest ways that households can save energy is by putting in more efficient light bulbs and cutting down on the number of appliances they leave in standby mode,” he says. “After you do these simple things, it can be really worth upgrading old appliances that tend to be big energy hogs, like hot water systems and pool pumps.”\nDavid says that while it makes sense to use more energy efficient equipment and building methods to a certain degree on new homes, and replace worn out equipment with more energy efficient equipment, it will make less sense to replace stuff that still has reasonable life in it. He recommends checking the energy star ratings of different appliances, and doing your research on homes, where possible. “You can get information on the energy savings of different rated houses, but it seems to need a bit of web search to uncover it,” he says.\nAn Ausbuild eight-star energy efficient home.

Upgrading to an efficient hot water system can save about $930 a year in South Australia and $650 in NSW\n● Switching to solar panels can deliver significant savings and substantial cuts in emissions. Installing a two-kilowatt system could save about $330 a year in Victoria and $470 a year in NSW and reduce emissions from energy use by about 23 per cent\nFor checking specific appliances or products, the Government has released an app that helps you work out how much money you’ll save by investing in an appliance with a higher star rating.\nSo maybe those stars are worth it.
