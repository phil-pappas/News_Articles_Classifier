While 2015 so far has been slightly better it is unlikely that the industry will recover to pre-crisis levels by 2019 especially given that the Crimean Peninsula which is now considered part of Russia was one of Ukraine's leading tourism destinations. Ultimately the country represents a significantly higher risk for investors than other countries in the region.\nWith geopolitical tensions in the region still high the risks facing Ukraine cannot be underestimated. Despite improved transport links the travel industry in the country is likely to face a difficult five years especially as the previously important Russian source market is unlikely to recover to levels seen in 2013 and there is not likely to be a compensating increase from other countries. In the long term BMI expects stabilisation and even the beginnings of a recovery in the tourism sector but this is dependent on stabilisation of the country as a whole.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nDespite investment prior to the 2012 football European Championships in the country the hotel stock in Ukraine is still in need of modernisation.
