In fact, by the time I turned 12, had decided I was going to study at Cambridge. I had already organised my GCSEs and A-levels to fit my ambitious goal. My plan was to do a philosophy degree and to carry on with law afterwards. To me, philosophy was the academic choice that collided perfectly with law studies. Hence, it was all about getting to Cambridge. I was so focused on it that I didn’t contemplate going anywhere else. I didn’t visit any other universities on my list or even look at the programmes in detail. In my mind, they weren’t back ups, they were just there because I needed to fill spaces up. It was only later that I realised what a stupid choice I had made. During exams, I worked the hardest I could. But it didn’t turn out as I had expected. On Results Day, as I discovered my grades ABC, I won’t hide that I went into a mini meltdown. I hadn't met the requirements, which were ABB. But I was so determined that I immediately decided I was going to resit my exams, and go to Cambridge the year after. There was nothing else in my mind. My twin sister was going to university at the same time. Even if I got better grades than her, I was the one that didn't have a place on Results Day. When she saw that I got 100 per cent in English literature, she asked me: “What are you doing? Why aren’t you studying English if you're so good at it?\". To which I answered: \"That’s not a university degree!” Even if I had always excelled in English literature at school, I only saw it as a hobby. I think I was quite influenced by my school’s views that the most valuable degrees are the typical Oxbridge subjects, namely law and philosophy. Besides, Clearing was something I disregarded. My grades had always been excellent and I was one of my class's top students. So in my mind it was only for those who weren’t expected to meet the grades. But my sister pushed me as she found out that the University of Liverpool was offering a place for English literature through Clearing. “Let’s ring Liverpool! Let’s give it a go!” she told me. It must have taken me a few hours to even come around to the idea to go through Clearing, but she finally convinced me. The Clearing team I talked to on the phone were lovely and very understanding. But it was definitely my visit to Liverpool which was the turning point. I came for a Clearing open day. The university and its surroundings were so inviting and wonderful that I completely changed my mind. I loved studying English literature. I enjoyed it so much that I stayed at the University of Liverpool to do a Master's in Victorian literature. And I still live in the city today. Now I can’t imagine my life differently to the one I chose since Clearing. One thing I do regret is my stubbornness. I should have looked at other possibilities before Results Day; I should have visited other universities than Cambridge, just to keep doors opened. Even if you believe in your strengths, you never know how you’ll do at exams. When I visited Cambridge, I had to sit a logic test and had two interviews; after that I was offered a place, so I said to myself: “Job done then!” But now I realise how important it is to keep other options available. Today I work for Northern Schools Trust and I also have my own business. It’s called Liverpool Girl Geeks and is designed for women who aspire to work in the technological industry. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:01:54.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
