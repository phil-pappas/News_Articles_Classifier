The UK regional airline will increase services from three to four flights each weekday in each direction on the route from 14 September 2015 with the introduction of a 2.50pm departure from Leeds Bradford, arriving in Southampton at 4pm. \nA new 12.15pm departure from Southampton arriving in Leeds Bradford at 1.25pm will also be available. The new flights are now on sale. These new flights will complement the existing 6.40am 10.35am and 5.05pm services from Leeds Bradford and the 8.20am, 4.30pm and 6.35pm flights from Southampton. Eastern Airways also offers a Sunday service leaving Leeds Bradford at 4.50pm and Southampton at 6.45pm. Yorkshire has strong business links with Hampshire and the south coast of England, particularly in finance, insurance, IT, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, construction and manufacturing industry sectors. Southampton is also steeped in maritime history with a world class port for cruise liners. Kay Ryan, Eastern Airways’ commercial director, said: “We are providing greater flexibility for business travellers with the increase in services to four flights each weekday between these two important business centres. The introduction of the afternoon service allows us to offer more choice and is a quicker, more convenient alternative to road or rail.” Tony Hallwood, Leeds Bradford Airport’s aviation development director, said: “The additional mid-afternoon frequency added by Eastern Airways will provide increased travel options for business travellers who are increasingly choosing to fly from Leeds Bradford to Southampton saving valuable travel time.’’ Eastern Airways has been operating scheduled services from Leeds Bradford since 2003 and also provides high frequency services to Aberdeen from Yorkshire airport. Fast track security channels are offered at both Leeds Bradford and Southampton airports for all Eastern Airways passengers to avoid any security search queues. This enables the airline to close check-in just 30 minutes before the departure time. Complimentary drinks and snacks are offered onboard the aircraft and passengers are not charged for check-in, baggage or choice of seat. A network of services across to 18 airports in the UK, Norway and France is operated by the airline on a fleet of 31 regional aircraft.
