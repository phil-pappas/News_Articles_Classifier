Look for leaves similar to dock leaves that have that distinct horseradish smell when scrunched. It is the root that you are after. Blitz seven smoked mackerel fillets in a food processor with the cream and lemon until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and fold in the crème fraîche, horseradish and herbs. Flake in the remaining fish and mix through for texture. Season to taste and serve with warm flatbreads. This is also lovely with chopped capers stirred in or a few pieces of pickled cucumber served alongside it.
