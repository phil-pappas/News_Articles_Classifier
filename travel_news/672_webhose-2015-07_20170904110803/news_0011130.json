I’m really enjoying the smaller form factor. I’m really enjoying having a mobile device that fits comfortably in my hand, that is easy to use with just a single thumb over the whole screen, and doesn’t require any gym-work to be able to lift it.\nApple iPod Touch 6th Generation, 2015 (image: Ewan Spence)\nThere are times when I want my smartphone to be a phone, and the iPod Touch has reminded me of that. Of course it connects over Wi-Fi, the use of FaceTime and iMessage allows for phone-like communications, and with it running iOS 8 it is clear to see what a ‘small’ iPhone 6 would be like.\nThis summer I’ve also purchased two iPhone 5S handsets for my daughters – and the primary decision on which handset to buy was around the physical size of the screens on offer, rather than the latest specifications or the newest handset. That said, if the iPhone 6 had been available in a 4-inch screened format , that would have been my first choice for the family… and the first choice for myself as well.\nThere has been a tendency for smartphones to grow in physical size over the years, and there was an inevitability that Apple was going to test the phablet market out at some point, which is where the iPhone 6 Plus comes in. What it doesn’t explain was the increased size that gave us the 4.7 inch screened iPhone 6. It’s a nice size, it sits in my hand, and I can just about use it one-handed… but oh it was nice to have iOS 8 back on a four-inch screen but with a modern chipset (even if the A8 chip was under-clocked to 1.1 GHz).\nThe Evolution Of Apple\nIt’s not just the size of the screen that has improved the iPhone experience in the small form factor of the iPod Touch, it is the updated hardware. The aforementioned A8 chipset gives the iPod Touch performance on a par with the current iPhone range, while the M8 motion co-processor allows Apple Health and other fitness trackers to use the hardware. The increased RAM over the previous iPod Touch also allows the full range of modern games and applications to be used.\nThere’s every chance that the iPod Touch is a precursor to a smaller-screened smartphone to be announced in September. The iPhone 5C has continued to be a popular device, even with the limitations of the A6 chip and the hobbled storage option of 8 GB . It is due a refresh, and if you want to look at economies of scale and providing a mid-range iPhone with last year’s components, then an iPhone 6C with an A8/M8 combination that mimics the new iPod Touch is a racing certainty.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T13:45:45.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
