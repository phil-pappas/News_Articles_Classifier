The main attraction here is the Paradesi Synagogue, writes Nerita D’Cruz. Jew Town in Cochin is a quaint town which greets visitors with its colonial houses and tiny shops selling antiques, curios and artifacts. The town is characterized by narrow lanes, lined with two storey buildings, some of which are painted with bright colours. As you walk down the street you can see traces of history which dates back to centuries ago when the Jews came to this land and made it their home. The Jewish Synagogue is the main attraction in Jew Town. This Synagogue also known as the Paradesi Synagogue is nearly 450 years old. It is the oldest functioning Jewish house of prayer not only in Kerala but in all of India and the rest of the British Commonwealth. There is a clock tower which was added to the Synagogue in 1760. The picture gallery outside the Synagogue, shows that during the first century of the Christian Era, following the destruction of the Second Temple of Jewish worship in Jerusalem, the Jews dispersed to different corners of the globe. Some of the Jews landed on the shores of Cranganore (now known as Kodungaloor which is 50 kilometres north of Cochin), in Kerala. The Rajah of Cranganore welcomed the Jews. In the sixteenth century when the Portuguese invaded Cranganore, the Jews fled to Cochin. During the sixteenth century, a number of European Jews also landed in Cochin following the expulsion of Jews from European countries. These Jews came to be known as Paradesi Jews. Descendants of Spanish, Dutch and other European Jews built a Synagogue in Mattancherry, Cochin in 1568 to meet the needs of the growing Jewish community in this area. The place where the Synagogue was built came to be known as Jew Town. The caretaker of the Synagogue ushers visitors inside, giving strict instructions that clicking pictures in the Synagogue is not permitted. Inside the Synagogue, there are metal chandeliers and fixtures hanging from the ceiling. There are oil lamps with glasses which were made in Cochin. These are more than 300 years old. Some of the chandeliers are from Belgium and are around 100 years old. There are 1100 willow pattern Chinese hand painted tiles on the flooring of the Synagogue. These tiles look identical at the first glance, but if you look closely, no two tiles are identical. K J Joy, the caretaker of the Synagogue, says that the Synagogue is open for prayer every friday and saturday. He says “at present, there are only four Jewish families comprising of a total of seven members residing in Jew Town.” Among the seven Jewish members living in Jew Town is Sarah Cohen, aged 92. While she relaxes on an arm chair, sipping a cup of tea, she greets visitors with a broad smile and speaks a few sentences about the weather in Cochin. Her memory is fading away, informs her caretaker. Framed photographs placed in Cohen’s living room, reveal a few details about Cohen’s family and relatives. Like Sarah Cohen there are six other members of the Jewish community living on Jew Street and most of them are above the age of 70. Joe Jose, one of the traders in this area, points out to the houses on Synagogue lane, saying that the architecture of the houses is such that there is no space between adjacent houses. The houses are attached to one another in a row. The interiors of the houses have huge spacious rooms. The windows have patterned grillwork with shutters on the outside. In 1949 (and subsequent years) most of the Jews emigrated to Israel and other countries of the Commonwealth. “They sold their houses to the locals in Cochin before they left the place” says Jose. Today parts of these houses are used as shops to sell antiques, curios, handicrafts, tribal art, spices and embroidered clothing. These items are brought from different parts of India and sold here. Some of the antiques include porcelain jars and crockery, coloured enamel kettles, wood carvings, wooden altars, holy statues, brass and copper items. These items may seem to be costly, but you might not find such a collection of antiques elsewhere, suggest some of the traders in Jew Town. A signboard on Jew Street, directs visitors to other historical places in the vicinity such as the Jew Cemetery, the Dutch Palace and the Police Museum. The India Pepper and Spice Trade Association building is also located on Jew Street. The Paradesi Synagogue, the Synagogue lane and Jew street along with the colonial houses and the dwindling number of Jews in this area, sum up all that is left behind of the Jewish community in Cochin. Jew Town is definitely worth a visit and while you are here, you can capture vivid pictures of this ancient town and collect rare antiques that you may not find elsewhere.
