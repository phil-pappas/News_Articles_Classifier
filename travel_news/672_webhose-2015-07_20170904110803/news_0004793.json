Set within the outskirts of the Yala National Park, the hotel was created to be as sustainable as possible, by conserving energy and being part of the environment without harming it. \n\nThe Heritage and Culture Award will be awarded to Ratchada Niramit, Thailand for its ‘ Siam Niramit Journey to the Enchanted Kingdom of Siam ’. The world-class performance aims not only to introduce Thai arts and culture to the world, but also to make Thai people take pride in their culture. \n\nThe Marketing Award goes to Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) for its ‘ Follow Me to Hong Kong ’ campaign, where world-renowned Instagram couple, Murad Osmann and Natalia Zakharova, were invited to Hong Kong to capture romantic photos and share them on social media. This increased the city’s exposure as a travel destination via the couple’s personal experiences. \n\nThe awards luncheon and presentation will take place at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre on September 8 during the PATA Travel Mart 2015. \n\nFor the full list of award winners, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T11:25:37.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
