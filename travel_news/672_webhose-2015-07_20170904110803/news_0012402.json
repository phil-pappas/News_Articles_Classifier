With the kids off from school and an extra day off at the office, the Independence Day weekend travel period from Wednesday (July 1) through Sunday (July 5) is typically considered a perfect time for a family vacation, AAA said. AAA has found that travel numbers have continued on a near steady rise since the recession, and this year’s boost maintains the trend. Home of the Day See All Homes of the Day Due to higher earnings, a strong employment market and gas prices at a steady low, Americans have extra disposable income, making them more inclined to take a holiday trip, AAA said. Low gas prices are a great excuse for an all-American road trip. Like past years, car travel dominates all other modes of transportation during the holiday, with 85 percent of all travelers expected to drive to their destinations. Although significantly less than car travel, the number of people journeying by air, cruises, trains and buses will increase from previous years as well. Travelers should expect to encounter moderately higher lodging and airline rates. Airfares for the top 40 domestic flight routes are 6 percent higher this Independence Day, averaging at $227, according to AAA’s Leisure Travel Index. \nWant Atlanta Travel news in your inbox?
