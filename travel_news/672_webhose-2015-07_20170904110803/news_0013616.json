Beginning with a Frank Lloyd Wright design for George C. Stewart's Montecito house in 1909, and ending with the Marin Civic Center in 1957, Frank Lloyd Wright placed his signature on the California landscape. In total, more than 20 of the 400 buildings Frank Lloyd Wright designed are located here. \nThe work Frank Lloyd Wright did in California was important. In fact, of the 17 Frank Lloyd Wright structures designated by the American Institute of Architects as most representative of his contribution to American culture, three are located here. These Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, along with others designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, are accessible to the general public. \nMost of Frank Lloyd Wright's California designs were private residences, but he also created California office buildings, shops, and a government center. They're organized in chronological order (by year of design), using design dates from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:36:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
