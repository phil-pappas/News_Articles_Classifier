Ben Edgeworth and Danielle Russell are design gurus who will be hard to beat in the House Rules grand finale. Picture: Tara Croser. Source: News Corp Australia\nThe latest season of the Channel Seven reality show has been “the most dramatic ever”, according to host Johanna Griggs.\n“It was a bit like being in the movie Mean Girls at time,” she laughed.\n“The competition really ramped up towards the end and it was pretty full on. It’s like the teams all of a sudden remembered it was a competition with this life-changing prize.”\nCan’t pick ... House Rules host Johanna Griggs won’t tip a winner for Monday’s grand finale, saying both teams have a strong chance. Source: Supplied\nThat realisation seemed to have the biggest impact on the New South Wales team , she said, who finally “pulled their fingers out” and got serious about the opportunity.\n“It’s safe to say Steve and Tiana had their bags packed for the first few eliminations. They were hopeless — totally hopeless. Then they hit their straps and turned it around.\n“They’ve done some brilliant work. It’s amazing to see the transformation, from one of the weakest teams we’ve ever had in this show to real contenders.”\nAmazing turnaround ... Steve and Tiana’s transformation from weak competitors to real contenders was remarkable. Source: Supplied\nBut beating the talented Queensland renovators will be a big ask, Griggs said.\n“They’re very strong, they’re consistent, they’re good. I picked Ben and Danielle for the finals from the beginning.”\nSteve said winning would allow him to spend more time with his young son, while Ben and Danielle said the strong financial position would allow them to start a family.\nGood opportunity ... winning the House Rules ultimate prize would allow Ben and Danielle the financial freedom to start a family.
