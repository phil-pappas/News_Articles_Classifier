M. Keck Observatory Adv: \nHAWAII - Despite the record-level hot and muggy weather that Hawaii is currently experiencing, snow fell on the mountain top of Mauna Kea today on the Big Island. \nAs the largest island, named Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, was dealing with heavy rainfall overnight, white flakes of snow wafted down from above, creating an image of cool mountains looking out over the blue Pacific Ocean. Mauna Kea stands 4,205 meters above sea level. \nTemperatures on Thursday, July 16, 2015, tied the record high set in Hilo in 1986 on the same date of 89 degrees Fahrenheit. At Honolulu airport on the island of Oahu, 91-degree temperature also tied a record set in 1995 there. In fact, in the month of July, high temperature records have either been set or tied 20 times this year. \nWith El Nino creating tropical depressions and storms – in general, unstable weather – in the Pacific Ocean, the Aloha State has been dealing with its normal cooling tradewinds being brought to a standstill. This creates the muggy atmosphere as well as rain. \nLuckily for Hawaii, the trades are always patiently waiting to return to bring back the typical comfortable weather only found in paradise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T02:26:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
