From the moment you step on the plane, your ears are accosted with announcements, people chatting away (rarely in their library voice) and, invariably, one or more screaming children. Add to that the roar of those engines that keeps your bird in the air, and it's a classic case of sensory overload. \nOne of the best ways to reduce fatigue from air travel is to soften the noise with earplugs. The beauty of earplugs is that they're inexpensive and effective. But just which kind(s) should you get? \nFlents Quiet Please foam earplugs are among the most ubiquitous on the market. You can buy them in small quantities or save money by purchasing 100 pairs at a time. Other brands on the market include Etymotic Research, 3M, Downbeats and Hearos. Earplugs with an NPR 29 noise reduction rating will likely be more than sufficient for most travelers. With basic NPR 29 plugs, you can still listen to your favorite tunes and hear that in-flight movie you've been waiting to see. If you are looking for further auditory bliss, add headphones over the top of earplugs. \nIn addition to foam, other common earplugs are flanged or made of silicone. While foam plugs fit inside the ear canal, silicone earplugs can be positioned over the ear canal. Flanged plugs, often worn by rock musicians and heavy equipment operators, have a cork screw design that helps seal off the ear canal. \nEarplugs don't just reduce airplane noise -- they also help reduce the pain or discomfort some people experience from changes in cabin pressure. According to Mayo Clinic , filtered earplugs slowly equalize the pressure against your eardrum during airplane ascents and descents. \nThese useful little devices are just as effective at tamping sound on noisy subways, buses and, well, any place that's too raucous for your sensitive ears. Overall, earplugs will give you peace of mind as well as peace and quiet. \nYou can find earplugs at airport gift shops, as well as at markets and pharmacies all over the world. If you become an earplug convert, look for great discounts online .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:45:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
