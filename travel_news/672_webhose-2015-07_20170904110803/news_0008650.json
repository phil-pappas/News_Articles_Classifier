Opened in June 2014, the 164-room property is the first Tokyo location from the Hyatt-owned Andaz boutique brand, which is known for integrating local elements into a hotel’s décor. Here, for example, a singular bonsai tree sits in the soaring lobby, while elegant washi-paper artworks adorn elevators. The seamless service reflects a redefined version of luxury in which guests are welcomed with drinks at smooth walnut tables in the lounge instead of standing at a check-in counter.\nLocation The centrally located property is in a quiet business district between Shimbashi and Roppongi. The nearest Tokyo Metro station, Toranomon, is a five-minute walk away.\nThe Room My spacious 48th-floor room, a Tower View King, was a study in harmony. Large windows framed a showstopping view of the Tokyo Tower and the glittering skyline. The startlingly comfortable low bed faced the windows, not the superfluous flat-screen TV. There was a long gray couch by the windows — my preferred perch for admiring the mesmerizing view — as well as a handsome wooden desk, a low table and a maroon leather armchair. Moss-colored carpeting was reminiscent of a Zen garden, while white wall panels evoked traditional fusuma partitions. Additional adornments were minimal but carefully chosen, such as a woodblock print and an art tome about the Edo-era artist Katsushika Hokusai.\nThe Bathroom Nearly as large as the room, the bathroom had sliding partitions and a beautiful walnut vanity. In a nod to Japanese bath culture, a deep circular tub was contained inside its own compartment alongside a rainfall shower. Artfully arranged amenities included sachets of bath salts in a seasonal “winter yuzu” scent. Other luxuries included fluffy robes, slippers and traditional cotton pajamas called yukata. Best of all was the high-tech Toto toilet that opened, closed and flushed automatically, suggesting that the height of civilization is never having to touch a toilet (with your hands).\nAmenities The Andaz strives to pamper, beginning with free Wi-Fi and a minibar packed with free snacks and nonalcoholic drinks (alcoholic beverages incur a charge). The hotel’s gorgeous AO Spa and Club, occupying nearly 15,000 square feet on the 37th floor, overlooks the Imperial Palace, so guests can get a massage or work out on the Technogym equipment while admiring the view. The spa’s aquatic area has a 20-meter pool, a tingly carbonated-water bath, a whirlpool and a hydrotherapy pool with powerful water jets.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Dining The Andaz Tavern, on the 51st floor, serves a pan-European menu beneath sculptures of looping curlicues by the British artist Charlie Whinney. Cocktails, Cuban cigars and Japanese whiskeys are served at the popular open-air Rooftop Bar, a sophisticated space with spectacular 52nd-floor views. Room service is available around the clock. My breakfast set order, which arrived in less than 20 minutes, included natural yogurt with passion fruit and mango, and a mini cast-iron dish of delicious baked scrambled eggs with confit tomatoes, goat cheese and crusty bread (3,700 yen). The ground floor also houses a pastry shop and burger bar affiliated with the hotel.\nThe Bottom Line Seductively stylish with a distinct sense of place, the stunning Andaz Tokyo Toranomon Hills hits every mark with ease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:05:06.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
