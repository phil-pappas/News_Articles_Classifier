It is understood that her review will look at all options. Ms Shaw will “work closely” with Sir Peter Hendy, who less than a fortnight ago was named the new chairman of the under-fire rail group. \nIn a further overhaul announced in the Budget, the Government also said that it would “change the way it channels public money through the industry, directing it through the train operating companies, so that Network Rail focuses firmly on the needs of train operators, and, through them, passengers”. \nNetwork Rail is currently funded by a grant from the Department for Transport and also receives money from “access charges” paid by transport firms that use the railways. \nIn a major change, it is understood that the grant will be reduced, leaving more money available for the franchise agreements that the DfT strikes with companies such as FirstGroup (LSE: FGP.L - news ) , Stagecoach and National Express (LSE: NEX.L - news ) that run services. Network Rail could receive more in “access charges” as a result. \nNetwork Rail was plunged into turmoil after the Government last month decided to “reset” its overly ambitious £38.5bn investment programme, which had originally been lauded as the \"largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times\" but has been dogged by mounting costs and delays. \nThe electrification of the Midland mainline from London to Sheffield and the Trans-Pennine route between Leeds and Manchester were “paused” and it was announced that Richard Parry-Jones, the chairman, would be replaced by Sir Peter, London's Transport Commissioner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T01:04:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
