It has charm and a sense of history, Colorado friendliness, great restaurants and bars.\nIts reputation for celebrity glamour is somewhat misleading because this ski resort, while certainly often chic, is laid-back too, full of ski bums and young adventurers.\nMost of all, Aspen has some of the world’s best skiing. Its champagne powder snow is legendary, yet it has many blue-sky days.\nFour different mountains offer more runs than you could probably conquer in a week. Its only disadvantage is that, unlike many European resorts, they aren’t linked by lifts, though each is easily accessible by shuttle bus.\n1. BUTTERMILK\nIf you want to start at the beginning, hit low-key Buttermilk on day one and get the ski legs going on 40-odd trails. This is Aspen’s least challenging ski area and often dismissed by more accomplished skiers as the destination for beginners, families and, thanks to its terrain park and Olympic half-pipe, snowboarders.\nIn my opinion (and I’m an advanced skier), Buttermilk is a rather lovely introduction to Aspen. Beginners will find green slopes even on the mountaintop, and those with more confidence ought to be happy swishing down well-groomed blue runs.\nWhat many visitors don’t realise is that Buttermilk does, in fact, have black runs too, accessed off the somewhat ignored Tiehack Express lift. With good skiers generally off elsewhere, it’s almost like having your own private mini-resort for a half-day, with nobody else around to ruin your powder. Those with a need for speed will enjoy thundering down Racer’s Edge. Sterner might be my favourite run for its banked curves and length.\n Skiing the fresh powder on Aspen Mountain.

It’s the most crowded, with huddles sometimes building up at chairlifts and skiers funnelled into town down Spar Gulch at day’s end. Mind you, crowded is only a relative term in Aspen.\nAjax is the mountain for people watching and sitting on sun terraces. Chase down its pop-up champagne and caviar bar, which makes an appearance on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays beneath bright orange umbrellas.\nAnd the skiing? Ajax has nearly 80 trails. None of them are green but, unless you’re an absolute beginner, you’ll manage its many well-groomed blue runs, which lead you all the way from top to bottom. Ski the old Roch Cup downhill race route, which follows Ruthie’s and Roch runs, for an epic cruiser.\nYou might first fortify yourself near the top of Ruthie’s with sausages and sauerkraut at Bonnie’s. For location alone (the venue itself is more cafeteria than restaurant), Bonnie’s is my favourite pit-stop on Ajax, with a huge terrace looking over the ski slopes and mountains beyond.\nAccomplished skiers can do summit to base in under 10 minutes: pure, swooping exhilaration all the way. On the whole, confident (or reckless) intermediates and experts will be most satisfied with Aspen Mountain.\nInteresting moguls provide double-black diamond challenges, especially on a series of parallel runs off International, collectively known as The Dumps, where locals head on powder days. Across the valley, Face of Bell and Ridge of Bell also favour those looking for bumps and powder.\nMy other tip for finding fresh powder is to drop into Kristi or Walsh’s runs (the latter is a snowboarding favourite), then track lower to Bingo Glades and Jackpot.\n Snowmass is generally an intermediate skier’s mountain. Picture: Aspen Ski Company Source: Supplied\n3. SNOWMASS\nBy the standards of most ski resorts, Ajax alone would be satisfying but, in Aspen, it’s trumped by Snowmass, which has many more runs, the steepest ski run (Hanging Valley Wall) in Aspen, and more vertical metres than any other North American ski resort.\nLower slopes are interknitted blues, upper slopes plunging double-blacks. Runs are nice and wide, where they can be narrow on Ajax. Snowmass is generally an intermediate skier’s mountain, even if it does offer significant challenges too. You can enjoy long cruises around Elk Camp or push your expertise between-tree trails on Sam’s Knob or off High Alpine lift.\nSnowmass is snowboarding territory as well. Trail maps specify which trails are snowboard friendly and which to avoid for their flatter terrain. The black-rated Cirque Headwall is the centre of the action, but there are also several terrain areas and a superpipe and pipe accessed from Coney Glade lift.\nIf you’re going to eat on the mountain, aim for Sam’s Smokehouse, where you get Texas and southern-style barbecued meats accompanied by beans, corn muffins and great views.\nSnowmass also has considerable accommodation and a purpose-built base town which, though lacking the charm of historic Aspen, is mostly ski-in ski-out and family friendly. Skiers are up early, when the late-night revellers of Aspen are still sleeping in.\n An uphill hike takes skiers to the pitches of the Highlands Bowl. Picture: Aspen Ski Company Source: Supplied\n4. ASPEN HIGHLANDS\nLocal hard-core skiers talk of this final mountain with a gleam in their eye. That’s mostly because of Highland Bowl, which offers a series of runs with 45-degree pitches reached on an initial 30-minute uphill hike. It’s one of skiing’s great challenges that keeps you within bounds but feels like a back-country adventure.\nIf you’re looking for vertical drop, ski the runs in the Temerity and Steeplechase areas, then head over to Olympic Bowl in the afternoon and work down the lines.\nIf you aren’t an advanced skier, don’t be put off Highlands, however. A look at the trail map shows 119 runs, with blues and even greens embedded among all those blacks with off-putting names like The Wall and Moment of Truth. Blue runs will take you from top to bottom. What’s more, the Maroon Bells peaks are magnificent, providing Aspen’s best scenery.\nPersonally, my favourite run on the whole mountain is the easy-rated Red Onion, where great natural terrain and rollers provide a happiness-inducing downhill glide. The blue-rated Thunderbowl is another merry trail and very wide compared with Highland’s mostly narrow tree runs.\nFolk on Highlands ski hard and party hard too. Book a late-lunch table at Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro high on the mountain for a quintessential Highlands experience. The legendary dining spot features fondue, raclette and elk stroganoff.\nAfterwards, taking the unsuspecting by surprise, a DJ cranks up the music, loud enough to shake the windowpanes. Veuve Clicquot flows and patrons dance on bench tops. Then everyone skis their final run, bellies full and cheeks creased as a Cheshire cat’s.\nThe writer travelled as a guest of Travelplan Ski and Colorado Ski Country USA.\n Skiing in Aspen Highlands.
