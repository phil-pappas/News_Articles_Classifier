It is a culture that is both vibrant and unique, and which more international visitors to Australia desire to experience.\nTourism Australia’s $250,000 “Aboriginal Australia: Our Country is Waiting for You” campaign is therefore a no-brainer. However, without the proper booking infrastructure, capability development of tourism operators, and a clear and precise call to action, this campaign will fall flat and could be described as tokenistic.\nRelated: From the red earth of Titjikala rises a legacy built on trust and respect\nInvestment in Indigenous tourism is good for jobs and in creating a social impact in many Indigenous communities where welfare and unemployment are the status quo.\nIndigenous tourism has huge possibilities both for revenue and jobs, and by its very nature also helps us protect our natural and cultural resources.\nThe Tourism Australia Indigenous campaign is a step towards highlighting the positives of our culture. However, it only focuses on two areas in the Northern Territory, Sydney and North Queensland. It fails to capitalise on the diversity of experiences that can be had from across Australia.\nThe biggest issue for me as an Indigenous booking agency owner is that the campaign fails to show the customer where they can get further information. The call to action is totally missing. The tourism industry has an ever-increasing number of internet-based channels for researching travel destinations and experiences. Mobile devices and social media account for the highest growth in the uptake of online bookings, so there is no excuse for missing it out.\nGrowing global interest in Indigenous culture is stimulating demand for products involving Australia’s Aboriginal peoples. The travellers targeted by the Aboriginal Australia tourism ad are “experience seekers” , people looking for unique and authentic personal experiences on holidays that are different from their day-to-day lives. They include people looking for spiritual experiences or adventure.\nThese are experiences Australians have typically travelled abroad in search of, not knowing the wealth of rich experience available in their own country. This is a market the ad will miss, as it is directed only at international travellers. Appealing to domestic travellers is important, because celebrating and embracing Indigenous culture through tourism can help bring all Australia together.\nCelebrating and embracing Indigenous culture through tourism can help bring all Australia together.\nIn 2013, Indigenous Business Australia produced a report on Indigenous tourism in conjunction with Griffith University and Queensland University. The report showed that both supply and demand for Indigenous tourism experiences existed, however there was no point of connection. Indigenous operators overestimated the appeal of the Northern Territory and travellers only had information that led them to believe that all Indigenous tourism available was in the Northern Territory.\nA fundamental component of any marketing initiative that is driven this far and wide is an understanding of the market’s price points. The IBA report showed that potential customers are generally unwilling to pay much for Indigenous experiences, generally citing “free” or a willingness to pay up to $100, even for some of the more involved options such as full day tours and accommodation. This campaign has failed to do its homework, as some of the experiences in the marketing promo are extremely pricey. The Arnhem Land experience, for example, would set the traveller back thousands of dollars just for the airline tickets.\nThis new marketing campaign does a fantastic job in setting a positive tone and image for Indigenous tourism but there needs to be an emphasis on locations where an Indigenous experience can be easily accessed within a reasonable price point. NSW for example, has the largest population of Aboriginal people and 73% of international visitors arrive in Sydney. In June 2013, the numbers indicated that Australia had 3.5 million visitors who participated in an Aboriginal experience. NSW catered for 1.3 million of these experiences.\nVisitors who did not participate in an Aboriginal experience cited “inaccessibility” as the primary factor. It is interesting to note that the report found the likelihood of participation in an Indigenous activity or experience is high if people are aware of the existence of such programs and accessibility is easy.\nRelated: How to cook meat and veg the Indigenous way\nTo fully take advantage of this willingness to participate, we must also look at industry barriers and concerns tourists have for the standard, timing, pricing, interest, logistics and location of an Indigenous experience.\nMy connection to country is by way of central Australia, my mob Yankunytjatjara, Pitjantjatjara and Southern Aranda. I understand the need to be spiritually fulfilled and enriched. As a Sydneysider now, I know that experience is as possible in the heart of the city, on a day trip to the Blue Mountains or on a weekend away down the south coast of NSW as it is in the Northern Territory. Each of these places offers a different Indigenous experience.\nThis campaign is a missed opportunity. It could easily have had more impact with research and a collaborative approach with industry people, such as the Indigenous tourism operators and booking agents. Currently, there are approximately 300 Indigenous tourism operations throughout Australia. Only a select few of these are represented through this new campaign.\nEven still, if those operators get the “bums on seats” that allow them to consistently operate, perhaps all Indigenous operators will benefit in the long run.", "external_links": ["http://www.australia.com/en/articles/best-aboriginal-experiences.html", "http://www.tourism.australia.com/markets/our-target-consumers.aspx", "http://www.iba.gov.au/2013/03/new-research-report-into-indigenous-tourism/"], "published": "2015-07-16T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T11:32:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
