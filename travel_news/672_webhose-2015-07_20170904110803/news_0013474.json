When comparing total flights for the third week of July 2011 with the same week this year, Lambert-St. Louis International Airport lost 7.3 percent of its flights over the last four years, according to schedules published by OAG and analyzed recently by masFlight at the request of the Wall Street Journal . That’s more than the 6.8 percent lost nationwide over the same period. Airlines flew 11,475 fewer domestic flights in the third week of July this year compared with the same week in 2011, the WSJ reports. St. Louis had 1,396 flights taking off in the third week of July this year, compared with the 1,506 flights that originated here in the same week four years ago, according to the OAG/masFlight data. St. Louis tied with Raleigh/Durham based on percentage of flights lost. The flight reductions are the result of eight of the largest airlines merging into just four carriers and, in the process of integrating, shutting down smaller hubs and completely cutting service to some smaller towns. In St. Louis, the number of seats fell overall 2.9 percent, to 164,223, in the four years, including all flights by major carriers, according to OAG/masFlight data requested by the Business Journal . Not surprisingly, St. Louis has gained the most seats from Lambert’s biggest carrier, Southwest Airlines , whose seats in St. Louis increased 6,546 over the past four years, but it was offset by seat losses from American Airlines , which is wrapping up integration of its operations with those of U.S. Airways following their late 2013 merger. St. Louisans had 8,870 fewer seats on American flights over the last four years. Lambert spokesman Jeff Lea told the Business Journal that consolidation is a key factor in fewer flights being seen at airports across the country. “We’ve seen airlines operate smaller planes on some routes. We’ve also seen others operate bigger aircraft on routes as they try to maximize their fleet and passenger loads,” he said. “While the total flights or departures have changed, the number of passengers served between in June 2011 (2,999,948 Jan-June YTD) compared to June 2015 (3,061,155 Jan-June YTD) is fairly equal.” Lea pointed out that this month, airlines added three non-stop flights from Lambert and two others will start in November and in January. “With these additions, we could have a strong push to improve our passenger numbers over the next year,” he said. The airlines’ cuts nationwide were disproportionate, the masFlight/OAG data shows. While cities such as Seattle and Austin, Texas, have seen hikes in service, Memphis International, where Delta shut down a Northwestern hub after its merger, saw a 66 percent drop in flights compared with July 2011. Milwaukee is served by 45 percent fewer flights than four years ago. The loss of hubs in the central U.S. means fewer connecting flights for east-west or north-south travel and fewer low-fare tickets. At the other end of the range, St. Pete/Clearwater topped a list of 200 U.S. cities with an increase in flights of 93.85 percent, however it only had 126 flights in the third week of July this year compared with 65 for the same week four years ago. More comparable is that Dallas Love Field saw a 37.9 percent increase in flights to 1,259 in the third week of July this year compared with only 913 four years ago. Despite the drop in flights, seats offered weekly by U.S. airlines were up 2.2 percent in the past four years, according to masFlight/OAG data. In reducing flights, carriers have switched to larger planes and added narrower seats. \nWant St. Louis Travel   Bizspace Spotlight", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T15:06:52.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
