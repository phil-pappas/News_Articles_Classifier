The three-time Ashes winner, who is an integral member of England’s cricket team, commented: “I am delighted to have been named as a Belfry ambassador given the resorts unrivalled history and heritage. The Belfry is one of our country’s most iconic sporting venues, having hosted the Ryder Cup on four different occasions, so I am very proud to be associated with them.” \nAs a keen golfer, Broad has always been fond of The Belfry; “I love playing the Brabazon course. Its layout makes you want to attempt tricky shots that you wouldn’t usually try, you end up taking the options the pros do and, when you get it right, there is no better feeling on a golf course; the 10th being a perfect example of this.” With The Belfry being so close to home, Broad enjoys playing and relaxing at the luxury resort and soaking up the first-class leisure facilities on offer from The Spa to The Ryder Grill. Following the announcement Resort Director of The Belfry, David Edwards, added: “It is fantastic to be able to name Stuart Broad as an ambassador. His previous success as part of the England team has been exemplary. Stuart has demonstrated the leadership, team spirit and commitment to excellence that reflects our approach to our guests. We look forward to working with Stuart and wish him the very best of luck for The Ashes.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T12:31:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
