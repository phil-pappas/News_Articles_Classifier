Taking an age-positive stance, it will explore and debunk prescribed ideas about how women should age, looking at how women are rewriting the rules around ageing, and focusing on all the positive aspects of being an older woman. We're looking for a wide range of women over 45 to take part – sharing their thoughts and opinions and being part of a discussion with other women. There will also be the chance to attend an event in London this August, with speakers and celebrity guests, to discuss the topic of how to age happily and healthily the way you want to over food, drinks and other special treats. If you're interested in forming part of our reader panel, having your views published on telegraph.co.uk, along with your photograph and trying out free samples of Dove Youthful Vitality, enter your details below before midnight on Wednesday, July 22, 2015.* *The first 40 eligible entrants will be chosen to take part.
