Kennedy (JFK) International Airport, the only post-security outdoor space accessible to all customers at a New York airport. The T5 Rooftop, which includes a green area and kid-friendly and dog-friendly spaces, is open all summer from 6am to 10pm for travelers who clear security at JetBlue’s home terminal — T5. This new outdoor park offers customers views of the Manhattan skyline and the historic Eero Saarinen TWA Terminal from an unexpected vantage point — a rooftop at the airport. \n\n\nThe T5 Rooftop, designed by Gensler, perfectly complements the overall design of T5 which emphasizes light and well-being. In addition to spectacular views, outdoor seating and New York-centric food carts, the T5 Rooftop also includes the first post-security dog walk area at JFK. Much like T5, the T5 Rooftop focuses on sustainability, convenience and humanity with features including: \nA wood roof deck, aluminum outdoor furniture and planters Free Wi-Fi New York-centric food and beverage carts/kiosks featuring Brooklyn’s Blue Marble ice cream and Hebrew National hot dogs Native plantings including oak leaved hydrangeas, lilyturf and sweetsphire Sustainable materials \n\n\n“As New York’s Hometown Airline, T5 was designed to show off the pride we have for our city. We brought many elements of New York into T5, including the new T5 Rooftop,” said Jamie Perry, vice president, brand and product development, JetBlue. “The latticed cable work in T5 holding up the digital ring in the Marketplace is a nod to the same elements on the Brooklyn Bridge and our grandstands were designed to mirror New York City landmarks known for people watching. As rooftop bars, sunbathing and summer enjoyment are such a big part of living in New York City, we wanted to bring this unique aspect to customers traveling through T5.” \n\n\nJetBlue celebrated the opening of the T5 Rooftop with a Live From T5™ concert featuringBrooklyn-based indie band Mainland, who performed selections from their debut EP, Shiner. JetBlue will host an ongoing Summer Friday series with DJ sets, acoustic performances, food and beverage samplings and other entertainment offerings for customers visiting the outdoor space and traveling through T5 this summer. \n\n\nJetBlue’s award-winning Live From T5 concert series has served as a platform for emerging artists and top pop acts. Since 2009, the in-terminal concert series has enhanced the JetBlue experience with live entertainment exclusively for customers traveling through T5. These surprise shows have featured performances by an array of artists across musical genres including Goodie Mob, The Wanted, Taylor Swift, Emeli Sande, Jason Derulo, Sarah McLachlan, Daughtry and more. \n\n\nThe T5 Rooftop is the latest enhancement to JetBlue’s award-winning T5, recognized as one of the world’s ten most beautiful airport terminals by Frommer’s. T5 opened in 2008 and an international arrivals hall, dubbed T5 International, opened in November 2014. The T5 Rooftop includes a 4,046 square foot park with landscaped green spaces, seating for 50 people, a 400 square foot kid friendly space and a dedicated 400 square foot dog walk area. \n\n\nSeveral JetBlue business partners and contractors collaborated on this project ensuring that the T5 Rooftop matched and enhanced T5′s existing feel and sustainable elements. Project partners collaborated on all aspects including infrastructure and design to construction. Business partners included Gensler, Arup and Turner Construction Company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T09:03:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
