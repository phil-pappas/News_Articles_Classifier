This means that married couples and civil partners will be able to pass on assets worth up to £1m, including a family home, without paying any IHT. Budget 2015: How inheritance tax changes affect you But the mechanics of the new rules are complicated and Telegraph Money has been inundated with questions from readers about how they will apply in practice. Here, tax experts from accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg provide answers. My wife passed away on December 15 2005. Prior to her death we altered the ownership of our £250,000 house to 'tenants-in-common' and we each left our half share in the property to our two daughters. The total value of my wife's estate was £219,626, leaving £55,374 (20pc of the unused nil rate band) to be passed on to me. I calculate this to now be £65,442 making my total allowance £390,442 when I pass on. When the new IHT allowance starts in 2017 how will the extra £100,000 affect my allowance? A similar house is for sale for £310,000. As I only own half of the house, say £150,000, what is the amount of my other assets I am allowed to leave before IHT kicks in? Is it £390,442 plus the £100,000 or will the £100,000 be reduced because I only own half of the house? KB, via email I assume that on your wife’s death her total estate of £219,626 passed to your children, not yourself, and that you will not have made any chargeable transfers in the seven years before your death, in which case your calculation of your available nil rate band is correct. The draft legislation states that, where the first spouse died before April 2017, 100pc of their family home allowance is treated as being available (restricted to the value of the property to be transferred). This means that if your share of the family home is valued at £150,000 on your death, your total available family home allowance is £150,000 (£100,000 of your own allowance plus £100,000 being 100pc of your late wife’s transferable allowance, restricted to £50,000 because of the property value). If the value of your share in the property at your death was £200,000, the full transferable family home allowance should be available. This means that your regular nil rate band of £390,422 should be available in full to offset against other assets. Got a question for our experts?
