One of the company’s alleged responses on its Facebook page. Source: Facebook \nDOZENS of Australian travellers could be left thousands of dollars out of pocket and without a holiday after a local travel agency ran into financial difficulties. \nConsumer Protection is urging customers of Fremantle-based Sky Air Services to contact them after receiving numerous complaints that flights and accommodation booked by the company had not been paid in full. \nWestern Australia’s Commissioner for Consumer Protection Anne Driscoll said others who are affected by the agency’s financial problems may not yet be aware of it. \n“I would urge customers who booked through Sky Air Services in Fremantle to contact the airline or accommodation provider to ensure that their booking is secure,” Ms Driscoll said. \n“I also encourage those affected to contact Consumer Protection so we can get an accurate picture of the number of consumers affected by this situation and keep them informed of developments as they occur. \n“Consumers who have made a booking using a credit card and not received what they paid for should seek a chargeback from their card provider. Unfortunately those who have paid by direct bank transfer may not be able to access redress in this way, which serves as a reminder not to pay for travel services in this way. People in this situation should still speak with their bank about what options they may have.” \nMeanwhiles, some customers have taken to the company’s Facebook page to complain, receiving some shocking responses, even allegedly telling one client “you’re a f***ing pain in the ass hard maintenance anways”. \nSky Air Services also appeared to hit back at another customer complaining about their actions. Another Facebook response.
