It's constructed with more than 100,000 Lego bricks.\nThe museum says thousands of visitors helped build the flag by adding pieces during their visit to the museum. The project marked the opening of the museum's new Innovation Wing.\nThe flag is on display through September. It measures 9.5 feet tall and 14 feet wide.\nThe Smithsonian's American history museum is also home to the real flag that inspired the worlds for the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that would later become the national anthem.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-07-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T06:05:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
