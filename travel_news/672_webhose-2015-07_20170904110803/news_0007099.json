As a result of research by the China Great Wall Society, there is little optimism regarding the protection of the Great Wall. For example, only 8.2 per cent of the Great Wall built during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) remains in good condition. Moreover, in a report released by the Chinese State Administration of Cultural Heritage in 2012, less than 10 per cent of the Ming Great Wall has been adequately preserved, 20 per cent is moderately preserved, and almost 30 per cent has disappeared. In 2003, the World Monument Fund in New York announced that the Great Wall was among the 100 most endangered historic sites. Bad weather is one of the main causes of damage to the Great Wall. Dong Yaohui, the deputy of the China Great Wall Society, said that most parts of the masonry structure of the Great Wall are in Beijing and Hebei province. Though they are more stable than the sun-dried mud brick Great Wall, in the rainy seasons during July and August, they can be easily broken by storms. Travellers exploring the “wild” Great Wall in recent years has led to damage, causing the bricks to loosen, and even walls to collapse Local data shows that in the summer of 2012, 36m of the Dajing Gate part of the Great Wall in Zhangjiakou, a city in northwestern Hebei province, was damaged by storms; the Shanhai Pass part in Qinhuangdao, a city in northeast part of Hebei province, leaked badly; while some fighting towers of the Wulonggou portion in Laiyuan, a city in western Hebei province, totally collapsed. Even in the dry seasons, because of lack of protection, the Great Wall in the mountain areas in Hebei province was eroded by mountain springs and even plant growth. Even if you just slightly touch the wall of the watchtowers in Funing County, Qinhuangdao, you will find soil peeling off in your hands. There are also trees growing in the cracks of the Great Wall. People living around or travelling to the Great Wall, which has not been developed into tourist attractions, are also damaging the wall. According to Zhang Heshan, a Great Wall protector in Funing County, more travellers have been exploring the “wild” Great Wall in recent years. This frequent trampling has led to damage, causing the bricks to loosen, and even walls to collapse. However, there were not enough protectors to patrol these areas, and not enough money to restore the damage. Damage limitation: workers repair the Banchangyu part of the Great Wall Journalists from the Beijing Times also found that people in some villages of Lulong County in the west part of Qinhuangdao lived in the houses built with ancient blue bricks. They told the journalists that these bricks were removed from the Great Wall nearby. Some villagers even sold Great Wall bricks with carved characters. An unnamed villager in Dongfeng Village told the Beijing Times that the market price for these bricks is 40 to 50 yuan (£4.10 to £5.20) a piece, or even as low as 30 yuan (£3.10). The villagers collect such bricks from the Great Wall without a second thought. According to Mr Dong, it is difficult for the government to fully protect the Great Wall. “In Funing County, there are only nine people in the department of cultural relics, but they have to go on a 142.5km (88 mile) tour of inspection. It’s definitely impossible to take good care of the Great Wall by themselves,” Mr Yaohui said. Mr Yaohui also stressed that the counties along the Great Wall are relatively poor, and those that the Great Wall in Zhangjiakou are national-assigned poverty counties. Local governments cannot afford to repair and protect the Great Wall, or only invest in the parts which bring in revenue from tourism. The duty of protection of the Great Wall belongs to both the government and the common people To some people, developing tourism is an effective way to protect the Great Wall. Xu Guohua, the head of Banchangyu Great Wall Development Company, said that the destruction from the villagers has stopped after the development of tourism. Meanwhile, tourists know which part of the Great Wall is endangered. “The development of the wild Great Wall brings rules and regulations to both the villagers and to travelers,” says Mr Guohua. “In recent years, the protection of the Great Wall in our scenic spots has become much better than in the undeveloped parts in our county.” However, many point out that it is impossible to develop the whole of the Great Wall for tourism. And while the development may bring more visitors to the endangered Great Wall, not all tourism development companies are committed to its protection. Instead, some of them only focus on the income from tickets, regardless of the intrinsic value of the Great Wall. How to protect the disappearing Great Wall? Obviously, it is an important test for Chinese society. As Mr Yaohui said in an recent article: “The Great Wall belongs to everybody of China. The duty of protection of the Great Wall not only belongs to the government, but also to the common people. The most urgent goal for us is to arouse the enthusiasm of the public to protect the Great Wall. ” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
