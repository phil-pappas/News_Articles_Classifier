Trump has a home in Palm Beach. In 2010, a local air traffic controller named the points DONLD, TRMMP and UFIRED. The last is a reference to the catchphrase \"You're fired\" from Trump's reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\"\nThe FAA said in a statement that the agency generally chooses names that are non-controversial.\nTrump has been under fire for recent statements accusing many immigrants of being drug dealers and rapists.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T01:27:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
