Typing #crewlife #passengershaming and #flyingfeet into Instagram and Twitter unlocks a world of celebrity encounters, crew confessions, drunken skirmishes and the barefoot bandits that blight the aisles.\nSome of the industry’s most outspoken insiders have revealed to MailOnline Travel the highs and lows of a life in the sky and how online camaraderie ensures that the global community is more connected than ever.\nOn Instagram, Passenger Shaming reveals the passengers you don't want to sit next to on a flight\nThis picture posted to Passenger Shaming shows the debris cabin crew were left to deal with on a flight\n‘No flight is ever the same. You never know what to expect when you walk on board. Every day is an adventure,’ Heather Poole flight attendant and author of Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama and Crazy Passengers , told MailOnline Travel.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next What crisis?

Share this article Share ‘Who wouldn't want to spend a few days in New York or Paris or lying on a beach in the Caribbean and get to stay in some of the best hotels?’ added Dan Air, the name behind Co nfessions of a Trolley Dolley which has more than 73,000 fans on Facebook and Twitter.\nDan has worked as cabin crew for more than 10 years for a UK bases airline and told MailOnline Travel: ‘The cabin crew community is far and wide.\n‘Both the blog and my social media are a place for cabin crew to come, have a laugh, share their pictures and stories. I also share lots of old pictures of the \"jet-set\" era with our #BringingBackTheGlamour pictures,’ said Dan.\nAir stewards also upload pictures of them enjoying their professions in the sky with tag #crewlife\nDisgruntled flyers took to social media to post a photo of a person clipping their fingernails on a flight\nOutlining why the life of a flight attendant fascinates many, Poole explained: ‘It's not just a job, it's a lifestyle, which is why it's hard finding a partner who can handle not just me, but my job - my life. It's a strange, but wonderful, nomadic life.\n‘Even though we're surrounded by hundreds of passengers, it can be a lonely lifestyle.’\nWhich is why social media is connecting and exposing the profession even more than ever.\n‘Flight attendants are big time social media users. It makes it easier to keep up with our family and friends when we're all over the place, on totally different time zones. Or when we're just too tired to talk because we're all talked out after a four day trip,' added Poole.\nHead over feet: Feet placed anywhere but the ground dominated Passenger Shaming on Instagram\nHappy holidays: Cabin crew were left a colourful surprise by a presumably young traveller\n#Passengershaming and #crewlife are popular hashtags dominating the cabin crew internet used to tag gorgeous locations, views from the flight deck and more often than not to share the bizarre requests, nudity and postures adopted on board by passengers.\nThe New York-based former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen, who set up the Rants of a Sassy Stew blog seven years ago and who invented the Passenger Shaming Instagram and Facebook feed, has well over a quarter of a million people subscribed to her feeds.\nMs Kathleen says that she receives hundreds of pictures of scantily clad, messy and inconsiderate travellers each week with the majority coming from other passengers.\nLimbs infringing on other people's space is a common Instagram complaint\nExposed feet are one of the most common complaints on Passenger Shaming's Twitter account\n'The people we discuss are a small number of people in the travelling public. Luckily you meet some great people on the job and feel that you can make a connection with passengers sometimes,' explained Kathleen to Mail Online Travel.\nDiscussing the oddity of some travellers, Kathleen recalls a time a passenger put their query light on at 35,000ft to ask her if the plane was moving.\nFeet frequently make an appearance where they shouldn't in photos on Passenger Shaming\nNothing seems to be off limits in the air, report flight attendants\nDan said: ‘A lady asked me as we were cruising at 39,000 feet how the emergency slides reached the ground. She believed that the slides could be inflated from up there and reach the ground.’\n‘One time a passenger asked me if he could borrow my dental floss. That kind of freaked me out. I mean where else in the world would you feel comfortable enough to ask a complete stranger for something from their toiletry bag?' asked Poole.\nBehind the pristine uniforms and dazzling smiles, there is a darker side to the profession which Poole blames on anonymity freeing passengers to act anti-socially on flights.\n‘On a flight nobody knows who they are. They're not in their regular circle. If someone cuts them off at drop off at school, they're not going to freak out and flip the other parent the bird. Because they'll see them again. People will talk. But on a plane...\n‘Also social media has made people internalise things more. Instead of talking to people, each other, working thing out, passengers would rather take to air their grievances. They get angrier and angrier as they type,’ said Poole.\nOn Twitter members of the profession share humorous memes and GIFs\nSense of pride: Despite highlighting their gripes online, most air stewards revel in their role\nDan also expresses concern over the growing number of incidents and cabin crew abuse caused by intoxicated passengers.\n'Now we all enjoy a drink when we're going on holiday or catching a flight. But the states some people get into is appalling and the abuse we often get is unacceptable.'\nThe online aviation community’s sharing is mostly light-hearted with many of them acknowledging a love and sense of privilege at their sky high profession.\nPoole noted: ‘It’s a gift and an education. It makes you realise you're not the only person in this world, your way isn't the only way. It opens the mind, and in turn the heart.‘\nRead more: Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama, and Crazy Passengers at 35, 000 Feet: Amazon.co.uk: Heather Poole: 9780061986468: Books Confessions Of A Trolley Dolly « Take a peek behind the galley curtain for all your cabin crew and aviation news, gossip and hilarious tales of life as a trolley dolly as we attempt to bring the glamour back to 39,000 feet!
