A rising star in the hospitality management world, Portuguese-born Duarte honed his skills in some of the world’s leading luxury boutique hotels in the UK and Vietnam before leveraging his talents to become the youngest hotel general manager in Mauritius, and most recently, a consultant in Zanzibar. Impressed with his unwavering devotion to building strong service cultures, youthful spirit and proven track record of success, PER AQUUM has designated Duarte as the brand’s newest daring-to-be-different leader. \nAfter taking over the management contract in December 2014, Minor Hotel Group (MHG) announced that Essque Zalu Zanzibar would be transformed into the newest member of PER AQUUM’s portfolio following the completion of the first phase of the upgrade programme targeting accommodation and selected public areas. The resort’s 49 suites and villas nestle over the Indian Ocean on the northern coast of Zanzibar. Duarte will manage the resort’s operations with signature PER AQUUM passion and imagination during the transition period whilst simultaneously driving its evolution into a PER AQUUM-branded property to be re-launched in early 2016. Upon accepting the new position, Duarte commented, \"Joining Minor Hotel Group and spearheading the transformation of Essque Zalu Zanzibar into a PER AQUUM resort marks a natural progression of my desire to continue operating unique resorts in exclusive destinations. What sets Essque Zalu Zanzibar apart is its distinctive sense of style, its appreciation for individuality and an uncompromising service – qualities already shared with PER AQUUM resorts.” Vice President of PER AQUUM, Nick Downing said, “Duarte is a bold leader, a pioneering thinker and true dynamo when it comes to lifting service to the highest levels with an audacious, memorable approach. We are excited to have his talents on board as we venture to another stretch of the Indian Ocean.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:32:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
