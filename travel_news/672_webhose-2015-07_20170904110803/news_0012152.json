It said that the Cabin OK initiative was not a maximum size limit and that such limits would continue to be set by the airlines. \nCabin OK \"does not require passengers to buy new baggage,\" IATA said. But IATA also explained that if every passenger used a Cabin OK bag, all of those on a flight of 120 seats or more would be able to get their bags on board, even on full flights. \n\"For passengers traveling with bags that don't have the Cabin OK logo, there's no need to worry,\" IATA said. \"If it was accepted for travel before, it will be acceptable for travel now — but with the same uncertainty that if the flight is full it may eventually have to travel in the hold.\" \nSaying that in the first place might have saved the initiative. But it was apparently too late. Such antagonism had built against the program — from the USA Today editorial page to the Global Business Travel Association to the Airlines for America trade group — that, less than a week later, IATA admitted defeat. \nOn June 17, IATA said it was \"pausing\" rollout of the Cabin OK initiative and \"beginning a comprehensive reassessment in light of concerns expressed, primarily in North America.\" \nI reached out to IATA to ask if there was surprise about the depth of the reaction. And more important, would it be reintroducing the initiative? IATA wouldn't say. A spokesman for the organization declined to answer any questions about Cabin OK. \nThe guess here, however, is that we've seen the last of it for a while. For one, what works in other parts of the world doesn't always work so well in America. We like things big, and we prize individualism. Completely reinventing the carry-on experience on the fly is inevitably going to generate blowback. \nPlus, as I've written before, American airlines are investing in expanded overhead bins to accommodate bags of varying shape and size. With consumers already feeling relatively hostile to the flying experience, airlines probably see little reason to add another target for their customers' ire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:05:20.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
