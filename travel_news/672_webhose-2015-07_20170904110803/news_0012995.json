And perhaps their best display of the year.\nA superb first half did not translate into a lead, but they overcame a penalty kick call against them, took advantage of one awarded to them and closed down a vaunted German attack for their fifth consecutive shutout.\n“We’ve been building into the tournament, and obviously this is our best performance by far in a lot of different ways,” midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. “We stuck to our game plan and stuck to what our coaches were telling us. We always stayed true to what we were doing and felt it was going to come together, and it felt like it did tonight.”\nUntil O’Hara’s goal, assisted by Lloyd, it appeared the match would be decided by a pair of second-half penalty kicks.\nThe U.S. defense did not yield any clear opportunities until Julie Johnston, in her only misstep of the tournament, misplayed a ball into the box and yanked down Alexandra Popp by the shoulder in the 59th minute.\n“I wish,” Johnston said, “I could’ve had that moment back.”\nUp stepped Celia Sasic, the World Cup’s leading scorer with six goals. Hope Solo was going to make her think about it, conversing with referee Teodura Albon and fidgeting beyond the goal line. By the time Albon placed the ball on the spot, Sasic did not look like a confident shooter.\nSolo dived one way. The shot went the other way . . . and wide of the left post.\nU.S. midfielder Tobin Heath, left, and goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris celebrate winning the semi-final football match against Germany during the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, on June 30, 2015.\nFranck Fife/AFP\nAbout eight minutes later, Albon awarded a penalty to the U.S. team, but this one was not as clear cut as the previous infraction. Alex Morgan surged toward the penalty area. Annike Krahn blocked her path. Morgan rode up Krahn’s back and tumbled.\nA foul? Maybe. But the contact had occurred before Morgan penetrated the box.\n“It was clearly outside the area,” German Coach Silvia Neid said. It wasn’t Neid’s only complaint: She believed Johnston should have received a red card for denying what she thought was a clear goal-scoring opportunity on the earlier penalty call.\nUnlike Sasic, Lloyd made no mistakes, striking the ball with authority into the upper right side as Nadine Angerer sprawled in the other direction for her third goal in three knockout-round matches.\nTo that point, Angerer was stellar. In the first 15 minutes, she made left-footed kick saves on Johnston’s header and Morgan’s breakaway.\nThe U.S. had done everything right in the first half, except finish their chances.\nThe match had taken a frightening turn when, on a German free kick, Popp drove her head into Morgan Brian’s, leaving both players in need of medical care. Popp bled profusely, while Brian was dazed for several minutes. Both returned.\nThe match swung back and forth on the penalty kick decisions, and the U.S. persevered.\nGermany’s forward Celia Sasic reacts after missing a goal attempt during the semi-final football match between USA and Germany during their 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, on June 30, 2015.\nFranck Fife/AFP\nAfter taking the lead, the U.S. defense repelled every German foray. Solo did not have to make a difficult save.\nO’Hara sealed the outcome — and the Americans’ fourth trip to a World Cup final in seven tries — with her first international goal.\nLloyd took the ball deep into the box before crossing to O’Hara for a leaping one-timer from close range.\n“Kelley was full-steam comin’, ” Lloyd said.\n“The second goal made it that much more rewarding because it’s not like we skipped by on the PK everyone can argue about,” defender Ali Krieger said. “No, we won, 2-0. We deserved it.”\nDespite their history of success, the U.S. entered the match as a decided underdog. They had muddled through the group stage, struggled to put away Colombia, then made marked improvement in beating China in the quarterfinals.\n“We knew we had this in us,” Ellis said. “This team had a lot of confidence. We had every belief we could win this game, and that is part of the spirit of the American player.”\n© 2015 , The Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrBYVOlwGAk?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/QWtFe_CXe8I?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-07-01T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:21:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
