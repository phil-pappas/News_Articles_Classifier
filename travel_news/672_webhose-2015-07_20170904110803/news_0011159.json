A review of the first major documentary about LEGO, by filmmakers Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson. Rating: 3 stars out of 4. By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic \nIt is, notes “A LEGO Brickumentary,” a language “more global than English or Windows.” Generations of us have grown up snapping LEGO bricks together: The same Danish company has been manufacturing them since 1949. The little bricks have inspired a feature film (“The LEGO Movie,” natch, and don’t blame the bricks for the ear-wormy “Everything Is Awesome”) — but, until now, they have never been the subject of a major documentary. \nNow that situation has been rectified, with this cheery, family-friendly film from documentarians Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson. Though they can’t quite prevent the experience from feeling a bit like a long and delightful commercial for LEGO, “A LEGO Brickumentary” is great fun, for AFOLs (Adult Fan of LEGO) or otherwise. \nPerkily narrated by a helmet-haired LEGO minifigure (known, among AFOLs, as minifigs), the film introduces us to some well-known people who love LEGO (Ed Sheeran, Trey Parker and NBA star Dwight Howard are interviewed); takes us to LEGO conventions, notably BrickCon in Seattle ; and introduces us to “brick films” (movies made with LEGO) and the charming practice of “LEGO bombing” (in which LEGO bricks are snapped into crumbling infrastructures, or made into small sculptures to be integrated into a landscape or city scene). Movie Review ★★★   \n‘A LEGO Brickumentary,’ a documentary directed by Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson. 92 minutes. Rated G. Varsity. \nBut it’s most compelling when showing us what can be done with a tub (well, many tubs) of bricks and an imagination. Seattle builder Alice Finch shows us her ethereal Rivendell — a vast, elaborate re-creation of Tolkien’s world made with multicolored bricks. In New York, LEGO artist Nathan Sawaya re-creates works of art in LEGO — a Degas ballerina, a Mona Lisa, an Etruscan vase. And throughout the film, we watch as the world’s largest LEGO sculpture gets created (an X-Wing Starfighter, made with more than 5 million bricks), to the delight of fans of all ages. “Anything is possible,” an AFOL reminds us, “when the right tools are in front of you.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T01:10:35.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
