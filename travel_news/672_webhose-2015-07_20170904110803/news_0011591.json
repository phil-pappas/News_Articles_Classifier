Even if they were black, they’d be miles from my blended experience. (AP) By Lonnae O'Neal Columnist July 2 at 3:00 AM Follow @lonnaeoneal In the past few months, I’ve fielded lots of questions about my recent engagement. At a graduation party and a pair of memorial services, extended family and friends seized opportunities to quiz my fiance and me about all our pertinents.\nThe takeaway point for those who didn’t know: He has three children, I have three children. Yep, I braced for incoming.\nWow, just like the “The Brady Bunch.”\nThat sounds like “The Brady Bunch.”\nYou guys are a black “Brady Bunch!”\n“HA! Never heard that one before,” I found myself saying.\nLet me just say this: We are not the Brady Bunch. Not only because we have two boys and four girls between us, instead of the three and three, or because we are black, and really, I do think that makes a difference.\nBut mostly because of this: As a cultural touchstone, “The Brady Bunch” in its milquetoasty way expanded our definition of family. More precisely, it moved cultural representations of family a shade closer to the alternate configurations many of us grew up with or saw all the time. Still, with everyone under the same roof, a stay-at-home mom and no exes in sight, “The Brady Bunch” retained all the broad structural contours we sanctioned. (Although I am very hip to the notion that off-camera, Brady exes could have been floating in a pool of shrunken heads. Hashtag: Suburban Gothic.)\nSince the show’s last mid-’70s episode, family has come to mean whatever people say it means. (Have you seen that new Tylenol commercial?) All kinds of love is winning.\nBut my fiance and I are skirting the cultural edges in a different way.\nWith two sets of three kids, each with their own separate activities on opposite sides of the Beltway — not to mention equally shared custody with ex-spouses who live five minutes away from our respective homes — ours is no expanded definition of family. It’s a new way to perform family. And there’s no Brady Bunch for that.\nWe’re both single parents one week, and see each other on the other. I can’t plan a dinner, a party, a movie or a getaway without an accounting of my schedule, my fiance’s schedule, what we’ve planned for the kids, what they’ve planned for themselves and the vast unknown territory called Ex-land. Basketball, ballet, choir, piano, his deadlines, my deadlines, ex No. 1’s travel plans, ex No. 2’s travel plans, drop-offs, pickups — all to be calculated. All while living an hour’s drive away (if there’s no traffic). Sometimes we fall asleep talking to each other on the phone.\nAfter two decades of a fairly conventional two-parent household, my new modern family feels like a cross between “Days of our Lives” and “Sharknado.”\nFour years ago, I turned to Deesha Philyaw, a Pittsburgh freelance writer and co-author (along with ex-husband Michael Thomas) of “ Co-parenting 101: Helping Your Kids Thrive in Two Households after Divorce .”\nWhen Philyaw and her husband separated in 2005, he moved around the corner. “We were like the magical unicorns of divorce and co-parenting,” Philyaw says.\nPeople couldn’t believe they could live that close or still be cooperative. Philyaw drew inspiration from the mid-aughts television sitcom “All of Us,” based on the co-parenting of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and Will’s first wife, Sheree Fletcher. The show featured a married couple with an ex who came in and out, but, says Philyaw, “the reality is far more complicated.”\nShe and her ex-husband are both remarried. They live on the same street. They split custody of their two daughters, 16 and 11. There’s Tuesdays and Wednesdays with Philyaw, Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays with their dad. One girl for one weekend with Philyaw, the other for two weekends with Philyaw (she also gets them if there’s a fifth weekend in the month). Tuesdays, each girl goes a separate way for dinner.\nPhilyaw’s new husband also has two girls, one of which he has full custody of. He lives in Prince George’s County. At the beginning of each month, they look at the calendar, factor in soccer and swimming, and say, “Okay, when are we going to see each other?”\nIf it all sounds complicated, that is because it surely is. You simply decide it’s worth it, and rejoice that you have choices.\n“Women in our mothers’ and grandmothers’ generation stayed in long and unhappy marriages in part because they feared, quite understandably, the very real financial and social peril that they and their children would face if they divorced,” Philyaw says.\nNotions about marriage, divorce and forever are less rigid now, but divorce is still hard,she says. “You don’t want to hurt your kids, but there’s no way of getting around that. However, when exes can be flexible and creative and co-parent in such a way that honors, through parenting time, the fact that both parents are important in their kids’ lives, kids are more likely to thrive despite divorce.”\nIn fact, so are the whole bunch (Bradys notwithstanding).\nSometimes there is a sheer physical impossibility to blending our families, and those times are hard. Then I throw a barbecue. The boys play ball, my teen daughter helps his tween girls bake a cake, my fiance and I drink MangoRitas and burn the chicken wings, and our new family feels exactly right. And the chaos feels like a fair price.\nFor more by O’Neal, visit wapo.st/lonnae .", "external_links": ["http://wapo.st/lonnae", "https://twitter.com/@lonnaeoneal", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1608824632"], "published": "2015-07-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T10:29:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
