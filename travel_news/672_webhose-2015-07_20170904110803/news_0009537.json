Barbara Podlucky Berens, who was federal judge David Doty's former law clerk, filed the paperwork. Doty is the judge the NFLPA wants this case in front of because of his history of rulings friendly to the union.\nNFLPA lawyers are asking for certain filings to be under seal because of a confidentiality agreement it has with the NFL. The confidentiality agreement was entered into last month, similar to that used during the Ray Rice ordeal.\nIn the filing, the NFLPA alleges Goodell's ruling yesterday \"does little more than rehash the Wells Report while ignoring arguments presented by the NFLPA.\"\nNow the Minnesota court will have to determine whether to allow this information to be filed under seal.\nMeanwhile, the NFLPA has until Aug. 13 to respond to the suit filed by the NFL in New York federal court yesterday.\nOne thing is almost certain: Only one court will hear this. There can't be two different Deflategate decisions in two courts. The NFLPA can argue that Judge Doty has experience with these types of disputes, thus should be able to hear this case. But the NFL will likely argue that its filing came first and that the arbitration took place in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:09:10.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
