Also, this year, shopping through Upromise could mean even more money in your pocket: From Aug. 3 through Aug. 16, Upromise will award $1,000 to a member each day and one lucky member will receive a grand prize of $10,000 in a Upromise account. The \"Upromise Save-enger Hunt\" Sweepstakes features a different method of entry each day. Entry methods range from signing up for Upromise, logging into a current account, or registering a credit or debit card to an existing account. To find out each day's entry method, check the Upromise homepage or sign up to receive emails. \"For children, back to school means going from toes in the sand to heads in the books, and for parents it means earning more money for college,\" said Charlie Rocha, executive vice president, Sallie Mae. \"This year we've upped the ante with even more rewards and opportunities to save for college while shopping for school. Families who shop online through Upromise.com with the Upromise MasterCard can double their college savings. Of course, winning $1,000 or $10,000 would be great, too!\" Upromise is free to join and its members have earned more than $900 million in cash back for college. Cash earned may be invested in an eligible 529 college savings plan, used to help pay down an eligible student loan, transferred into an FDIC-insured Sallie Mae High-Yield Savings Account, or withdrawn by check. With more than 850 online partners such as Macys.com, BestBuy.com, 10,000+ local and national restaurants, and partnerships with top travel and hotel sites, Upromise is the place to save for college with everyday purchases. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T18:03:58.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
