By Keroack Photography. \nRoyal Viking’s seven-day Rhine Getaway itinerary provides travelers with the chance to set foot in four countries—Switzerland, Germany, France and Holland—and sail past the castle-capped hills of the scenic Middle Rhine. \nIntroduced in 2014, the 190-passenger Viking Longship Hlin (pronounced Lean) measures 443 feet in length, a size that is optimized for passage through the locks along the Rhine and is nearly identical to the lines’ other European longboats cruising this river. \nThis turned out to be convenient on a cruise the week prior to ours, when, in a rare occurrence, unusually high water levels precluded the ships from crossing past a certain point. It was no problem for Royal Viking passengers: They simply packed up, swapped boats with cruisers headed in the opposite direction, took a bus around the troublesome point, and continued on their journeys. Even their cabin numbers remained the same. Accommodations on Viking Longship Hlin \nWe loved reclining on the comfy bed of our Veranda Stateroom and looking through the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors or relaxing on our balcony as we watched the passing scenery. \nOur 205 square foot stateroom had ample storage space, with a double closet with shelves on one side and hanging space on the other, plus two small dressers. The bathroom had a glass-doored shower with a rainspout and handheld spray and off-the-sink shelf space for cosmetics. A nice surprise were the complimentary L'Occitane amenities and having both 220V and 110V outlets. \nThe in-room 40-inch TV offered a wide choice of English-language stations and movies, and Internet is free throughout the ship, although generally too slow for large downloads.There’s also a safe and mini-fridge, and constantly replenished complimentary bottles of fresh water. Most amazing, it seemed every time we left our room, we returned to find it tidied up. \nIn addition to our Veranda Stateroom, the ship offers two levels of suites. Two 445 square foot Explorer Suites at the back of the boat have private wraparound verandas; two room 275 square foot Veranda Suites have a veranda off the living room and a French balcony in the bedroom. There are also smaller (135 square foot) French balcony cabins as well as “standard” 150 square foot cabins on the main/water-level deck with half-height windows. Dining Aboard Viking Longship Hlin \nViking River Cruises’ ships offer two dining venues for each meal and meals are served at set times. Dining room tables seat groups of six and eight, but the Aquavit Terrace also has tables for two. \nEach morning, the main dining room laid out an extensive breakfast buffet with yogurts, fruits, smoked fish, cheeses, wonderful breads and made-to-order omelets as well as table service for a changing array of specialty items like eggs benedict . \nAttentive waiter service in the dining room made the three-course lunches and dinners seem luxurious. Seating was at tables for six or ten, making meals a social time. A less formal option for every meal was on the Aquavit Terrace, where diners could select from a smaller buffet selection, dine al fresco and enjoy drink service from the bar. The Terrace has retractable glass doors, offering protection on cooler days. \nMenus tend to cater to American tastes, with a few local specialties like wiener schnitzel featured along the way. Vegan and special diet cruisers we spoke with were pleased with the chef’s willingness to cater to them. Standard wine and beers were included with meals; special vintages and cocktail hour drinks could be charged to our cabin. \nSeveral times we were greeted back to the ship after our excursions with a surprise amuse bouche such as salmon tartare or a small pastry. There was also a self-serve push-button coffee station with surprisingly good cappuccino , latte , macchiato and other choices available 24/7, often with scrumptious fresh cookies or morning muffins. Activities Onboard Viking Longship Hlin \nThe focus is on destinations, so shipboard activity is limited and evenings are low-key. Among the highlights were a classical concert by a pianist-cellist duo; a talk about German-French culture, stereotypes and relations; and a “chanson” singer who sang U.S. favorites along with French and German songs. \nOn a lark, we went to a “name that tune” contest where teaming with another couple made for great fun. On several evenings there was dancing to the ship’s versatile pianist/singer, and our cruise director gave daily talks about upcoming excursions as well as an insightful orientation to her hometown, Amsterdam. \nEspecially popular was the tour of the bridge, where we got a taste of the modern technology that allows captains to communicate with other ships and raise and lower the bridge to pass under low overpasses. \nThe top sun deck offers shuffleboard and mini-golf. A walking track drew a handful of joggers and walkers. Most people were content to relax on comfy wind-sheltered loungers, sit around the outdoor tables or stroll the deck, snapping photos and talking to fellow passengers. \nOne floor down, the sheltered Aquavit Terrace was especially popular on days when the top deck was too windy or chilly. There was also a small library with great travel books about the region and complimentary-to-use PCs. Rhine Getaway Cruise Itinerary and Excursions \nThe Rhine Getaway itinerary cruises between the friendly cities of Basel and Amsterdam . We cruised downstream, from Basel, stopping at the cities of Strasbourg, Heidelberg, Cologne and Koblenz as well as small towns including Breisach and Rudesheim am Rhein. \nAmong the highlights was a half-day narrated passage through the Middle Rhine, gliding past hilltop castles, pastures and farmlands, and the Loreley Rock , legendary home of an abandoned lover-turned-siren who lured fishermen to their death. \nThe ship tends to sail in the evenings and generally spends the day docked either in town or at a port close enough to walk in. Shuttles were provided when the walk was more than five or ten minutes. \nMost mornings begin with a complimentary early (8:45 or so) tour. Passengers can chose between a standard tour, which usually involves a fair amount of walking, and a less active one that covers less distance. The ship’s system of breaking passengers into smaller groups that departed at set times worked well to make getting on and off the vessel efficient. Thanks to rechargeable Quietvox listening devices, it was easy to hear guides without crowding around so we could truly focus on wherever we were. \nIn most ports, an optional, added-charge afternoon, and in some cases, evening tour such as a typical brauhaus (beer house) dinner, was offered. Generally we opted to spend time exploring the towns on our own. However two of the optional excursions—a trip to the Colmar World War II Museum and a tour of Bruhl UNESCO Palaces and their baroque gardens outside Cologne—were among our favorites. Ports of Call in Focus: Basel, Strasbourg and Amsterdam \nMost of the ports on this four-country cruise are in Germany. However, the route also takes in three very different non-German cities. \nWe started out in Switzerland’s oldest university city, Basel , where we planned our arrival early enough to enjoy lunch, unpack, join the Viking Hlin’s guided walking tour through Old Town (given at 1 and 3 p.m.) and still have some free time to visit stunning buildings like the 16th century Gothic Rathaus (town hall), with its brightly painted allegorical façade and interior frescoes and the Kunstmuseum Basel, the nation’s oldest and largest art museum. \nBus shuttles were offered between the ship and town center, but we enjoyed the 15 minute walk, stopping to admire the city beaches dotting the banks of the Rhine and the small, current-powered ferries crossing the river to connect the two sides of the city. \nWith its half-timbered houses reflected in its waterways, beautiful churches tucked into lovely corners of the city and German/French cultural mélange, Strasbourg is one of Europe’s prettiest and most distinctive cities. Here, brasseries serve wonderful Alsatian cuisine—onion pie, sauerkraut and sausage—and the towering Gothic Notre-Dame Cathedral is awe-inspiring with its flying buttresses, fearsome gargoyles, spired tower and lacy façade. Inside, mass is accompanied by resounding organ music and its famous Astronomical Clock struts its stuff every day at 12:30 p.m. \nIn Amsterdam our final stop, we docked a 20-minute drive out of town. Shuttles (for those whose flights or post-cruise stays were booked through Viking) or taxies were arranged to the airport and town. \nWe went on our own, purchasing a two-day I Amsterdam city card that provided free public transportation and entry into museums including the Van Gogh museum, Rembrandt House Museum and the Hermitage Amsterdam, a branch of the St. Petersburg Hermitage. (Since Anne Frank House and the Rijksmuseum are not included, we visited those on the day our I Amsterdam pass expired). \nAlso included was a don’t-miss canal cruise where we learned how the city was reclaimed from the sea, the distinctive layout of its concentric rings of canals, the etiquette of the Red Light zone and other fascinating tidbits of information about this charming, open-minded Dutch city. Ports of Call in Focus: Heidelberg, Cologne and Koblenz \nHeidelberg, home to Germany’s oldest university and watched over by the ruins of its ancient red sandstone castle, has inspired works by poets and composers, including Sigmond Romberg’s operatta “The Student Prince.” In its historic Altstadt, or Old Town, pubs, boutiques and eateries fill the pretty baroque buildings, catering to both tourists and students. \nCologne, another university town and Germany’s largest city on the Rhine, also brims with joie de vivre, boasting the most pubs per capita, and we were happy the itinerary allowed a full day and evening to explore. An intellectual and commercial center since Roman times, Cologne was heavily bombed during World War II but its lacey-spired Gothic Cathedral survived intact. \nIn Koblenz, our cabin looked out at a statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I, situated at Deutsches Eck (German Corner), the point where the Rhine and Moselle meet. The pubs and cafes of its compact pedestrian Altstadt are lively day and night, while serious shoppers can hit the adjacent glass-enclosed mall. Ports of Call in Focus: Breisach, Rudesheim and the Kinderdijk Windmills \nThe Rhine Getaway itinerary also stopped at charming small towns. Breisach was the departure point for an excursion into the Black Forest, including a stop at Hofgut Sternen, a tourist center where we could watch a demonstration of how cuckoo clocks are made, sample local schnapps and of course, Black Forest cake , and depart on well-marked scenic trails through meadows and into the mountains. Breisach itself was a tiny gem of cobblestoned streets lined by pastel-painted homes and shops and a hilltop cathedral—St. Stephen’s, as notable for its views of the surrounding vineyards as its Romanesque and Gothic architecture. \nLined with tourist shops, cafes and brew-houses with oomp-pah bands, Rudesheim felt like a quaint German version of a New Jersey shore town. The town is also known for its brand i ed Rudesheim coffee, garnished with whipped cream and chocolate and for its wines. Just behind the main streets of the towns, trails lead through the steep mountainside vineyards for panoramic views. \nOne of the most interesting stops was at Kinderdijk, in The Netherlands. Touring this tiny settlement of still-operating 18 th century windmill-homes, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is hard not to be fascinated by the technology that has been holding back the sea for centuries. In fact, without dikes, windmills and other pumping devices, much of Holland would now be under water. Could the Rhine Getaway Cruise Be Improved? \nTraveling with Viking River Cruises is one of the most relaxing way to travel, and this itinerary packs a lot into a week. Plus, the staff are exceptionally eager to please, making for happy fellow passengers. We had no complaints, not did we hear many from fellow travelers, but there’s always room for improvement. \nMore regional cuisine. The chef definitely catered to a variety of American tastes and special diets but our favorite meals were those featuring local dishes. We wondered why these were special events instead of a more integral part of the dining experience. \nCultural offerings. There were two outstanding cultural talks and our tour guides were all excellent, but most of the daily briefings were brief and logistical. We would have enjoyed additional on-board talks or even films providing deeper historical and cultural context. \nNoise. Our cabin was quiet but passengers on the bottom deck complained of noise; some ended up sleeping with ear plugs, which the ship provided on request. \nBikes. Unlike some lines, Viking doesn’t travel with bikes for its passengers. Yet that suited the baby boomers and older travelers on this cruise just fine. Is a Viking River Cruises Rhine Getaway Right for You? \nThe Rhine itinerary and excursions cater to history and food-oriented travelers. And on a ship this small, it’s easy to make friends. It’s also easy to find a quiet corner on deck or on your balcony to simply relax and watch the river flow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:37:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
