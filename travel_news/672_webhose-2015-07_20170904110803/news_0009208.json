Korea 12 Jul 2015 at 12:43 637 viewed 0 comments WRITER: AFP - + SEOUL - Domestic flights were cancelled in South Korea Sunday as Typhoon Chan-hom brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to southwestern provinces. \nTravelers look at an electronic board showing the cancellation of flights following Typhoon Chan-hom at Jeju airport in the southern resort island of Jeju on July 12, 2015. \nThe storm grounded 60 domestic flights linking Seoul with the southwestern coastal city of Yeosu and the southern resort island of Jeju, airport authorities said. International flights were not affected. \nA strong wind alert has been issued along South Korea's southern and western coastal areas, which received up to 197 millimetres of rain as of 11am (9am Thailand time). \nWeather authorities said the typhoon would be downgraded to a tropical storm when it reaches North Korea's Hwanghae province on Monday morning. \nTyphoon Chan-hom swiped eastern China on Saturday, paralysing transport links and devastating farmland as authorities evacuated more than a million people, the Chinese government and state media said. \nFive people in the Philippines were killed earlier in the week and more than 20 people injured in Japan on Friday. \nTaiwan was also affected by the storm, closing its stock market and shutting schools and offices Friday as heavy rainfall and fierce winds battered the north. \nA number of flights in and out of Japan's Okinawa island chain and northern Taiwan were cancelled. \nThe US government's Joint Typhoon Warning Center forecast that after hitting China, Chan-hom would head towards the Korean peninsula, bringing \"gale-force\" winds to the west coast of South Korea. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
