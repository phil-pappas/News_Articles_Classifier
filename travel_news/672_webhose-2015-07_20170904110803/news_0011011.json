The five-day event gets started on Wednesday and runs through Sunday. The festival includes a parade, a carnival, a performance by Don McLean and, of course, lobster. Thursday is also the day of the festival's 68th Maine Sea Goddess Coronation, which begins at 8 p.m. The festival takes place in Rockland's Harbor Park. It first took place in 1947. It's happening amid a boom in lobster catch in the state. Maine lobstermen are catching more than 120 million pounds of lobster every year for the past three years. Catches between 60 million and 80 million pounds were more common a decade ago. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:36:05.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
