Evening departures are LCY 17:55 and ORK 16:00, making a full day practical in either direction. \nThe airline will also offer one return flight on Saturdays and two on Sundays. \nPat Byrne, Executive Chairman, said: “We are very excited about this expansion of our route network. We believe the London City to Cork route has significant potential and indications are, as we launch a major marketing and promotional drive, that there are many travelers, both business and leisure, that want to enjoy the fast access and hassle-free experience that London City Airport offers. Our experience in operating into and out of London City Airport is that any passengers who try it remain on the route.” \nCityJet operates seven daily flights from Dublin to LCY in competition with British Airways. Figures for May 2015 reveal the carrier flew almost 23,000 passengers, a 50% year-on-year increase and higher than any month in the airline’s 22-year history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:38:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
