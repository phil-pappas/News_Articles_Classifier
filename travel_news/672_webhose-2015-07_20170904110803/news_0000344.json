The World’s Best Awards winners were selected by Travel + Leisure readers who participated in a survey rating cruise ships on the quality of cabins, food, itineraries and excursions — in addition to value. \n“This recognition is a tribute to the immersive storytelling and creative entertainment we provide to our guests of all ages, on all of our ships, wherever we sail,” said Karl Holz , president of Disney Cruise Line. “To be named the best of the best by Travel + Leisure readers is an honor and speaks directly to the quality of the vacation experience delivered by our dedicated crew members.” \nThis is the seventh consecutive year that Travel + Leisure readers voted Disney Cruise Line as the No. 1 Mega-Ship Ocean Cruise Line for Families and the second consecutive year they rated Disney Cruise Line as the Top Mega-Ship Ocean Cruise Line overall. \nSince first setting sail in 1998, Disney Cruise Line has established itself as a leader in the cruise industry and continues to provide a setting where families can reconnect, adults can recharge and kids can immerse themselves in worlds of fantasy only Disney can create. Castaway Cay is Disney’s private island paradise in the tropical waters of the Bahamas, reserved exclusively for Disney Cruise Line guests. In a setting of crystal-clear turquoise waters, powdery white-sand beaches and lush landscapes, the 1,000-acre island offers one-of-a-kind areas and activities for every member of the family. \nDisney Cruise Line has received more than 100 distinguished awards from the travel industry.
