Your weirdest world travel stories Share your stories, photos and videos. \nThe four tourists have now been released from prison and allowed to go home, where they'll probably forevermore regret the fact that googling their names brings up stories of misjudged clothing removal on an Asian mountain. That's not something that's easy to erase. They'll also regret that they're now poster children for misbehaving travellers the world over. \nOf course there are also plenty of other travellers who are front-runners for that position. Like the couple that was arrested in Florence recently after allegedly having sex on a park bench. Or the travellers who were filmed streaking through Machu Picchu ​ last year. Or the thousands upon thousands of backpackers who drink and yell their way around Asia and Europe every year. \nREAD MORE: Top 10 badly behaved tourists \nTravellers misbehave. They always have and they probably always will. This misbehaviour ranges from the innocent and the minor – like pointing the soles of your feet at someone in Asia – to the willful and the destructive, like those great pioneering travellers, the British explorers, who would arrive at their destination and steal all of the marbles (sorry, Greece). Compared to that, a quick flash on a mountaintop doesn't seem so bad after all. \nI feel the pain of all of these misbehaving travellers, however, because any traveller should know that it's very difficult to be perfect. Especially when you're overseas. Especially when you're young. \nFor starters, you might set out wanting to respect and obey local customs and rules, but sometimes those local customs and rules seem pretty stupid. (It was a little harder, for instance, to take Malaysia seriously once people started blaming the naked travellers for a subsequent earthquake in the region.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T10:19:23.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
