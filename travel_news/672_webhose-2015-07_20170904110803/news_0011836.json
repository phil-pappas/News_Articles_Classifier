The final day of WTM looks at winter sports tourism, cruising and gastronomy. \nWTM senior director Simon Press said: “The World Responsible Tourism Programme is one of the most popular and best attended. It will be no different at WTM 2015 with a variety of topics to engage thought-provoking opinion and debate on critical subjects for the travel industry.” \nSpeakers for the programme will be announced at a later date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T13:06:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
