In the run up to Christmas, Headingley Carnegie Stadium, home to Leeds Rhinos Rugby Club and Yorkshire County Cricket Club, is giving partygoers some true, 007 glamour with two James Bond-themed events. \nOn 11 and 12 December, guests at the two special parties will be served a glass of sparkling wine on arrival, followed by a three course meal created by chefs from the Headingley Experience, which manages conferences and events at the stadium. A starter of warm, vine roasted tomato tart with ricotta cream, will be followed by chicken ballotine, with turkey and apricot mousseline or baked cod loin with sun-dried tomato chestnut salsa and a dessert of passion fruit mousse with Christmas berries. They will then be able to spin the roulette wheel at a Casino Royale and have their picture taken in the photo booth, with their friends or colleagues, for a lasting memento of the evening. In addition, on selected dates throughout December, the Headingley Experience will be hosting Boogie Nights, which includes a three course meal and the chance to dance the night away to classic tracks from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Alternatively, those wishing to organise their own party can choose from a number of function rooms – including the only suite in the country to offer views of two international grounds - and work with the stadium’s chefs to build a bespoke menu suited to their own requirements. Jacqui Page, sales manager at the Headingley Experience, said: “This really is a Christmas schedule For Your Eyes Only and, with an on-site hotel, Headingley’s guests don’t even need to go home – they can party all night long.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:37:29.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
