The Forest of Bere, Hampshire Distance: 1-3 miles Who could resist a romp around Winnie the Pooh’s playground in Ashdown Forest, known locally as the 100 Acre Woods? This is a great family walk of between one and three miles, depending on which of the signposted trails you take. For children, there’s the attraction of two adventure playgrounds that have wigwams, tree houses and a shingle stream. West Walk car park is a good place to start, because it is the closest to all the facilities, which include a refreshment stand, toilets and playgrounds. Visitors can also hire barbeques from the Forestry Commission in summer. The nearby village of Wickham is also great to visit, and has a number of places to eat and drink. 2. Sherborne Estate, Gloucestershire Distance: 1.5 miles This is fairly flat and easy walk that’s ideal for young families. The woodland stroll wends through the estate’s parkland and water meadows. There is a sculpture trail, and children have the opportunity to collect letters en route to solve a mystery two-part word. It’s a great walk for nature spotters: if you’re lucky, you might see deer, otters and buzzards. The trail is particularly spectacular in autumn, when the estate’s beech tree avenue turns copper and gold. The circular route starts and ends at Ewe Pen Barn car park, opposite Lodge Park, a 17th-century country “grandstand”, now owned by the National Trust. 3. Farne Islands, Northumberland Distance: 0.5 mile You need to get a boat from Seahouses harbour (car parking available) out to the Farne Islands for this coastal walk, which takes in lighthouses, cliff tops, and, at certain times of year, thousands of nesting seabirds. The island – Inner Farne – has a rich medieval history, giving sanctuary to St Cuthbert in the 7th century, but is now better known as a haven for wildlife. Those visiting in the early months of the summer can see seals, puffins, terns and guillemots. There’s also a castle and the Churn blowhole, which can spout water up to 90ft (27m) in the air. The boardwalk route is suitable for those with buggies. Boat trips run daily from April to September. 4. Durdle Door and White Nothe, Dorset Distance: around 7 miles This is a more adventurous walk, with some steep inclines, so it’s not suitable for those with very young children. But it does take in some spectacular views across the Jurassic Coast – and the possibility of an equally spectacular ice cream on the beach. Along the way you’ll see the famous rock arch of Durdle Door - some 140 million years old. The Jurassic coast is also famous for its fossils, so families can combine a shorter version of the walk (from Durdle Door to Lulworth) with a visit to the Heritage Centre and Fossil Forest of Lulworth Cove. Car parking is available in Lulworth and Durdle Door, although it will get busy in summer months. 5. Lyme Park loop, Macclesfield Distance: 5 miles This walk takes you across canal towpaths into woods and along the grounds of stately homes. It’s one of OS’s most walked routes and the easy terrain means it’s particularly popular with families. The route takes walkers past the deer park of Lyme Hall. This building, now owned by the National Trust, is best known as the stately home used in the BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice , featuring Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Car parking is available near the canal at Higher Poynton. • To find out more about the Ordnance Survey’s OS Maps service, visit os.co.uk/osmaps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T19:46:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
