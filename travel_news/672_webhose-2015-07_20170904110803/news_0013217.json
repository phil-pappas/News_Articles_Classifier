These names may seem unfamiliar to you, but they are among a throng of “challenger” banks battling it out to attract savers’ deposits. Rates are at historic lows and falling. The average easy-access cash Isa rate was just 1.01pc in May, according to Bank of England data. Big, established savings providers – notably the big banking brands – seem less likely to compete than ever. Three of the top five easy-access savings accounts on the market for instance, are all offered by smaller brands. Kent Reliance pays 1.45pc, while Virgin Money, a bank owned by the Virgin Group and founded by Sir Richard Branson in 1995, pays 1.41pc. Tesco Bank, a retail bank formed in 1997, and which has been wholly owned by Tesco since 2008, pays 1.35pc, while Saga, the over-50s lifestyle group, pays the fifth best rate, at 1.35pc. Birmingham Midshires, which specialises in savings, pays the top rate at 1.5pc. It is owned by Lloyds Banking Group, but frequently offers better rates than its parent. • Digital-only challenger bank Atom wins licence • 'Challenger bank' launches best-buy savings account By comparison, Lloyds’ best easy-access account pays 0.75pc, while HSBC’s best account pays a measly 0.25pc. The cash Isa best-buy tables are similarly sprinkled with less familiar names, such as State Bank of India, an Indian bank with headquarters in Mumbai, and Dudley Building Society, a regional mutual. Nationwide, however, as Britain’s biggest building society, seems to be the exception here, regularly featuring in the savings best-buy tables. It currently pays the best rate for a one-year fixed-rate Isa, at 1.65pc, and is the market leader in the easy-access Isa category, paying 1.6pc to customers who also hold or open a “Flex” current account. Savings with all of the smaller deposit-takers mentioned here are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, up to £85,000 per person or £170,000 for joint accounts. This scheme will protect your savings, up to the limit, should the institution go bust. • Challenger bank matches best 12-month fixed rate deal • Another challenger bank releases a best buy savings bond Digital-only Atom Bank, the latest challenger bank on the market, last week received its full licence from the Bank of England and expects to start serving customers this year. Star fund manager Neil Woodford is among the bank’s biggest backers, but it still needs to finish raising the £75m required to meet the regulatory capital rules. The bank’s chairman, Anthony Thomson, previously co-founded Metro Bank, another challenger which opened in 2010. Metro, Tesco Bank, M&S Bank, and TSB, which split from Lloyds at the end of 2013, are some of the better‑known challenger banks on the high street. Sue Hannums, director at Savings Champion, said that the number of best buys being launched by challenger banks in recent weeks “had been significant and will hopefully continue to benefit savers”. Even in the notice-account sector, which is less popular with savers than cash Isas, easy-access accounts and fixed-rate bonds, challengers continue to outshine the bigger players in the market. “Challengers currently account for all five positions in the notice account best buy tables,” Ms Hannums said, “which just goes to show how competitive these banks are in this area of the savings market, as well as elsewhere.” • For alerts on the latest best-buy savings accounts, sign up to our weekly Money newsletter Follow @telegraph High Interest Paying Current Accounts Bank Account Name Offer More details Nationwide FlexDirect 5% on balances up to £2,500 Apply Santander 123 Account 3% on balances from £3000 Apply Clydesdale Bank Current Account Direct 2% in credit interest Apply", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:14:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
