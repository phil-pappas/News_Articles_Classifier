Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nTo show on the Paris schedule requires being approved by the French fashion gods at the Federation Francaise de la Couture, who govern whether the term “haute couture” can be used (much like the word Champagne) and decide if a designer can join the official line up. One off pieces are shown at couture, which are made to measure upon a client request. A number of follow up appointments or fittings between the piece being ordered and delivered are expected.\nPOACHING WARS: THE STARS NETWORKS CAN’T AFFORD TO LOSE\nABBEY LEE IS TURNING HEADS ON THE BIG SCREEN\nANNETTE SHARP: BILL COSBY’S FALL FROM GRACE\nThese appointments are at the house in Paris (so you will need to visit 3-4 times in a few months to be fit). Ordering haute couture is a serious commitment. These clients don’t want to turn up at a party and see someone in their outfit and when you purchase haute couture that is extremely unlikely.\nThere are Australian haute couture clients and their numbers are growing.\nA model walks the runway for the presentation of Viktor & Rolf Fall-Winter in Paris.

Many of the houses use haute couture largely as a marketing exercise. Viktor & Rolf are a good case in point because this week they showed an extraordinary collection of wearable art.\nThe models walked out draped and wrapped in framed paintings, some of which were removed on stage by the designers to reveal a simple denim smock underneath.\nBut it did serve as the precursor to that evening’s party to celebrate 10 years since the launch of the Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb fragrance at which Tori Amos performed and a tonne of celebrities attended.\nIt’s one of the most successful fragrance launches in modern history, so there was plenty for the designers and their partners the L’Oreal group to celebrate.\nViktor Horsting, Tori Amos and Rolf Snoeren attend the Viktor & Rolf FlowerBomb fragrance 10th anniversary party in Paris.

Picture: AP Source: AP\nThe L’Oreal bosses were also celebrating 80 years of Lancome and the night before had hosted a lavish party. I chatted briefly with Naomi Watts at Armani Prive. Chanel had Kirsten Stewart playing baccarat next to Julianne Moore. It was a challenge to focus on the couture rather than their sparkly jewels. Now I’m writing this from Portofino where Dolce & Gabbana are showing their Alta Moda (their couture) show. You won’t see it on Vogue’s social media because we have been asked not to post anything to protect the clients’ privacy. It’s a four day festival and the finale is a gold party, or “let there be ORO!” (Italian for gold) as the invitation reads.\nI almost had a heart attack when I read that on the plane but I arrived in my room to find a Dolce & Gabbana gold dress which fits like a glove and gold shoes to match.\nI think I have found my real life fairy godparents.\nOriginally published as Inside the world of haute couture", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/966714-bb7d5e4c-2777-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/where-100000-dresses-are-the-norm-inside-the-world-of-haute-couture/story-fn9076o9-1227437966850", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/966796-bcb3017e-277a-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/964881-63763d18-2777-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/966770-7ef24a02-277a-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/catwalk-model-turned-actor-abbey-lee-is-turning-heads-on-the-big-screen/story-fni0cvc9-1227437768421", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/966742-5cc99980-277a-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/966824-be03cd2e-277a-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/11/1227437/964963-596b6cd2-277a-11e5-b424-466486ab9bda.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/bill-cosbys-fall-from-grace-the-father-figure-who-must-live-whats-left-of-his-life-with-great-stigma/story-fnpn118l-1227437441522", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/television/there-are-certain-stars-tv-networks-cant-afford-to-lose-but-that-doesnt-stop-their-rivals-trying/story-fni0cc2c-1227437439148"], "published": "2015-07-12T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
