Its full-year operating margin is expected to be just 7.4 per cent. \n“The recent government announcement regarding the ‘living wage’ adds considerable uncertainty to future financial projections in the pub industry,” said Tim Martin, chairman. \nThe company admitted that pre-tax profit this year was “unlikely to be higher than last year”. \nIn the budget, chancellor George Osborne said that he would increase the minimum wage for over-25s to £7.20 from £6.70 in April, and to £9 by 2020. \nThe pressure of rising wages compounded the threat posed by cheap supermarket alcohol sales, which have been cannibalising the earnings of pubs for several years, Mr Martin said. \n“The average price of a pint in a supermarket is less than £1 and we estimate staff costs to be around 10 per cent or 10p. In contrast, a pint in a pub costs around £3 and staff costs are about 25 per cent or 75p. Increased labour costs therefore affect pubs with far greater force than supermarkets.” \nHe added that this disadvantage was “compounded by a huge VAT and business rates disparity between pubs and supermarkets”. \n8.4% \nFall in JD Wetherspoon share price, to 706p, on Wednesday \nShares in Wetherspoon have fallen 20 per cent since 2011. They closed down 65p to 706p on Wednesday. \nSome analysts were still optimistic, though, about the group’s prospects. \n“The ‘living wage’ will increase costs but it will also put more money in the pockets of would-be JD Wetherspoon customers,” said Mark Brumby, analyst at Langton Capital. \n“The group is likely to be outperforming its competitors — and particularly those without access to the funds to invest — and longer term, it should draw clear from the pack,” he added.
