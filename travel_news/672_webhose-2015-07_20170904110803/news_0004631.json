Cebu in general has a good reputation as a destination for MICE or tour groups,” said Montenegro. \nHe added that the Quest Hotel brand is “very successful” even in Indonesia and that in the Philippines, the 427-room Quest Hotel in Mactan has a comfortable and equal mix of domestic and foreign clients. \nHe however underscored the need to improve Philippine airports if the country wants to become a major MICE player in the region. \nQuest Hotel has “a tremendous opportunity for growth in the Philippines but we need to get our airports geared up to support its growth”, he remarked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T11:12:03.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
