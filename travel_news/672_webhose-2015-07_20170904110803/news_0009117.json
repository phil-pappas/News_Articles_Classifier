The property is situated close to the Beirut International Airport and is only a few hours’ drive from cultural and historical sites. Set in exquisitely landscaped grounds, the hotel is comprised of luxury accommodation, 11 multi-purpose meeting rooms and outdoor venues, five restaurants and bars, the Essential Spa & Health Club, a private beach, marina, four pools and an on-site shopping arcade. \nGreen Globe congratulates Movenpick Hotel Beirut on its recent re-certification for the fourth year running and its commitment to sustainable operations and management. \nPasquale Baiguera, General Manager at Movenpick Hotel Beirut said, “Movenpick Hotel Beirut is fully committed to promoting sustainability. This commitment is reflected in the hotel’s management principles and its daily practices which aim to advance a sustainable future for the generations to come. Our aim is to undertake and publicize the best sustainability practices, to reduce the environmental impact of all our activities and to encourage all our stakeholders to do the same.” \nMovenpick Hotel Beirut uses the Hotel Optimizer management system designed by Green Globe’s preferred Middle East Partner FARNEK to record and monitor all energy and water consumption, as well as benchmark waste quantities. Sandrine Le Biavant, Director Consultancy at FARNEK, confirmed that in 2014, (taking into account consumption variables), the hotel showed improved performance with a 6.21% reduction on the previous year for energy and 5.32% reduction for water. And this trend, particularly for water, has been maintained for the first two quarters in 2015. \nThe hotel has a comprehensive Sustainability Management Plan that outlines key actions to be taken in each area. Currently, one third of the hotel has LED lighting installed with plans to increase this energy saving lighting throughout the property. Also, dimmers have been installed in lobby areas and outdoor lighting is controlled by photocells further reducing energy usage. \nTo maximize the use of natural resources, water is sourced from seawater through a reverse osmosis desalination system. And the irrigation of hotel grounds is only done at night to conserve water resources. \nIn line with its waste management initiatives the hotel has deployed recycling bins throughout back of house areas. Movenpick Hotel Beirut also follows a packaging minimization policy whereby locally sourced fish, meat and cheese are supplied in re-useable plastic containers rather than cardboard or Styrofoam. To further reduce its impact on the environment, biodegradable amenities, environmentally friendly carpet and biodegradable trash bags are utilized at the property. \nMovenpick Hotel Beirut’s management and staff are actively involved in numerous community projects including participation in the Beirut marathon and sponsoring the Lebanese swimming competition. The property also contributes to local charities and donates linen and soft goods to Family Cares. Furthermore, recycled bottle caps are collected for the organization, Arc-en-ciel, which sells them to a recycling factory in order to purchase wheelchairs. \nAs part of its social and corporate responsibilities, the hotel conducts training programs for community members and has signed an agreement with People with Disabilities - Economic and Social Inclusion Project led by the Lebanese Physical Handicapped Union. Training is expected to begin during 2015. In addition, the hotel provides internships for students who attend a local hospitality school. In 2014, twenty-two internships took place. \nAbout Movenpick Hotels & Resorts \nMovenpick Hotels & Resorts, an international upscale hotel management company with over 16’000 staff members, is represented in 25 countries with 82 hotels, resorts and Nile cruisers currently in operation.
