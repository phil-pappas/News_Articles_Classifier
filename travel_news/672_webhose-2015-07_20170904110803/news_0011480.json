The former Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 that sustained damage while flying through a hailstorm over China is flying to an Arizona desert airport where Delta Airlines Inc. stores retired jets. The damaged plane, a 26-year-old Boeing 747-400 registered as tail No. N664US, hasn't flown since landing in Seoul June 16. Passengers on Flight 159 from Detroit recounted a terrifying, stormy flight that left the plane with a smashed nose cone and what appeared to be damage to its wings and engines. The plane was over the Pacific Ocean Friday morning after filing a flight plan to Pinal Airpark in Marana, Ariz. It was scheduled to land at 9:35 a.m. local time but will likely land in the early afternoon.
