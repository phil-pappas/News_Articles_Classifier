As a rapidly growing economy and a place of great natural beauty, Kazakhstan has a lot to offer to both tourists and business travellers, and we are delighted to welcome them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:45:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
