Despite the fact that mezcal has been around for nearly 200 years, its star is just now on the rise. While it doesn’t have the name recognition as such go-to cocktail liquors as vodka, whiskey or tequila, a sudden surge in popularity has led to an increase in exports to the United States and Japan. Mezcal is derived from the piña , or heart, of the maguey plant which is a type of agave. While these agave plants can be found nearly everywhere in Mexico, mezcal is primarily produced in Oaxaca. Mythically, mezcal was said to be discovered after an agave plant was struck by lightening and it’s juice was released. It typically takes between seven and fifteen years for the agave plant to mature before its juice can be extracted and turned into mezcal. The liquor is most commonly produced in fábricas or palenques, small-scale production houses. Handcrafted by around 9,000 individual producers around Mexico, mezcal is given its distinct smoky flavor as the agave piñas are roasted in underground pit ovens before being crushed and left to ferment. Mezcal, like tequila, is distilled twice. After its first round of fermentation, the resulting liquor is about 75 proof or 37.5 percent alcohol by volume. After being distilled a second time, it can reach up to 55 percent alcohol by volume. Though mezcal is often drank straight up, its complex smoky flavor can also compliment sweeter cocktails. For those looking to drink it unmixed and with an authentic garnish, you’ll want to have some “sal de gusano” handy. Literally translating to worm salt, I quickly found out (after already eating it, that is) that unlike duck sauce, the worm salt rimming my glass was actually made of grubs. To be precise, it’s made of gusano larva, a type of caterpillar that feed on maguey and agave plants. While you won’t find a worm in every brand or bottle of mezcal, don’t be surprised if you do, for some say it’s an essential part of the flavor. Mezcal cocktails can now be found on drink menus around the US, but if you’re struggling to find a place to try it out, consider mixing your own margarita or shandy at home with the aid of the recipes listed below.
