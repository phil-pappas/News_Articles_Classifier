With obstacles that range from schools to freeway access to ever-increasing drainage issues. \nFlorida is one of the dream spots in America! The land of milk and honey that every individual dreams of to spend their vacations or raise a family. Florida is extremely famous for its beaches Sunshine and Nightlife the city contains all the places and events that any individual can desire. Home is a place of safety and security where you can rest after a hard day's work it is a place where you can unwind and re-energize yourself. The biggest investment that any individual makes in their lifetime is in their home therefore when deciding to buy a home it is important to consider factors such as neighborhood Location and access to facilities in the area. Florida is a city of condos where thousands of tourists from all over the world come to spend their vacations and rent these condos to have a fun and relaxing place for themselves. But despite all these perks it has been becoming increasingly harder for people to find homes in Florida there are several reasons for it that are explored below. \nDue to the failing economy a number of property owners and real estate dealers are avoiding to sell their house in expectation of improving the economy and better conditions in the future. But despite huge efforts by the local authorities and the federal government the country is unable to recover completely from the depression. This continued slack in the prices have motivated the house owners to sit on their properties rather than letting them go. Due to the decrease in prices and a decrease in the available properties the real-estate market is operating very slowly in the region. \nMany families around America and throughout Europe prefer to spend their vacations at the sunny beaches of Florida which are famous for their unique food and culture. This high influx of tourists every year enables the property owners to rent out their properties as holiday lettings and continue to enjoy revenues at regular intervals from their properties. This phenomenon and tourism industry has also caused the property owners to abstain from selling their property to any potential buyer. \nDue to huge losses in the real-estate market that created a worldwide economic depression the state and legal authorities have been imposing harsher litigations over the real-estate market to avoid any such incidents in the future. So a combination of all these factors have created a slack in the property market in Florida which has made it increasingly difficult for individuals to acquire homes in the region. \nMedia Contact \nCompany Name: Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate \nContact Person: Michael Landino \nEmail: mlandino@me.com \nPhone: 239-992-0059 \nAddress: 24031 S.
