But it hasn’t been able to showcase the fruits of its labors: that is, to present local audiences with the many well-known names on its roster after they made good.\nSo Friday night’s concert performance “Aida” was a wonderful step — in several regards. Not only was it another opera at the Filene Center, Wolf Trap’s main stage (and the more of those in a summer, the better), it was also a tangible reminder of how well the program selects and prepares its singers: Its cast, made up exclusively of Wolf Trap alumni, was one you might well hear and enjoy at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.\nAt a time when opera-lovers tend to wring their hands about the state of Verdi singing, it was refreshing to hear a uniformly strong cast, from Michelle DeYoung, the company’s artist in residence this summer, who sang as Amneris, through to Anthony Ciaramitaro, one of this year’s young studio artists, who made the most of the few lines sung by the Messenger.\nThe score of “Aida” does a lot of dramatic heavy lifting: If a singer is able to hit the notes accurately, it’s almost impossible not to make an effect. That’s a big “if” and perhaps a subjective measure.\nI changed seats at intermission, curious about whether I would have a different experience sitting closer to the stage and out of direct range of one of the banks of speakers that are necessary in an outdoor setting.
