But first, one last dispatch from Peru.\nLoving it: My heart started pounding as the dune buggy slowly crept toward the ledge. The sun was setting over a skyline of perfectly sculpted sand dunes. The engine roared as the buggy leapt over the edge. The initial screams transformed to laughter as we climbed the next dune to continue our sand roller coaster.\nThe desert oasis of Huacachina is nestled between the dunes below. The tiny town in southwestern Peru is nothing more than a few short streets and a stunning palm tree-lined lagoon. The dunes attract travelers like myself who want to try something adventurous — sand boarding.\nI wax my board with a candle, strap my feet down and haphazardly glide down the side of the dune. I fall multiple times but climb back up to the top to repeat the process, laughing the entire way.\nLiving it: After a few days back in Lima, exploring the city's swanky museums and delectable culinary scene, I jumped on a flight to my next stop: America. The decision to go back was simple — my electronics were in major need of repair and could only be fixed in the U.S.\nAfter almost eight years of almost constant travel, I have mastered the art of travel hacking. I hoard frequent flier miles. I only paid for one flight the entire seven months I traveled in Latin America. In May, I traded in 45,000 miles for six flights (two international and four domestic in Peru). I paid $128.31 in fees and taxes for more than $2,100 worth of flights.\nAdvertisement What's my secret? I collected miles through travel reward credit cards, hotel loyalty programs and years of job-related travel. Airline alliances allow me to earn and redeem miles on member airlines across the globe. The best deals for mileage purchases are usually on international flights, U.S. domestic flights over $300 and for off-season travel. Otherwise, I buy the cheapest fare.\nI consider frequent flyer miles to be an investment like an IRA or 401(k). They are a safety net if my travel funds or plans go astray. If I don't like where I am, then I have the ability to change locations. (For the record, I also have a traditional IRA.)\nDreaming it: Each time I return to the U.S. from an extended trip abroad, I spend a few weeks exploring new places.\nMy goal is to visit all 50 states, and I'm currently at 37. I flew into San Francisco to visit friends, meet with a magazine and most importantly, fix my gear. The day after I arrived, I left on a short road trip north to Humboldt Redwoods State Park, home of the world's tallest trees, in northern California, where I wandered on forest trails with 1,500-year-old trees towering above.\nThe drive down the 32-mile scenic Avenue of Giants highway took hours because I kept stopping to take photographs and explore hiking trails. My neck ached at night from constantly staring towards the sky.\nI head north for my next stop to check Seattle and Vancouver off my bucket list!\nAnna Mazurek has been traveling the world and working (as an English teacher, photographer, bartender — whatever keeps her moving) as she goes since 2008.
