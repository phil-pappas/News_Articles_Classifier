That time you quit after only one backcountry lap. The weekend to Silverton you skipped. Those dawn patrols you slept through.\nCome July, those mindless moments of indifference become punishable offenses.\nBut you can find redemption down south, where the high alpine in Argentina and Chile just got hammered with a huge storm that kicked off what promises to be a deep season in the Andes. Almost six feet of cold blower certainly bodes well for the South American ski season, and Chile's 66-year-old Portillo is trumpeting its fresh coat with a promise of August face shots.\nThere are several ski areas in the Andes, but the venerable Portillo is like the Aspen of the lot. Unreal views, exposed steeps and a historic luxury hotel push the Portillo experience to a higher level.\nAs South America's oldest resort, Portillo echoes with history. The walls of Hotel Portillo's halls are framed with hundreds of black-and-white pictures, many dating back to those first leather-booted turns in the early 1950s. A stroll around the hotel is a history lesson in South American skiing. There are wool-clad skiers plying the steeps on unwieldy boards alongside captivating images from the Southern Hemisphere's only World Alpine Ski Championships in 1966, back when pioneering athletes like Jimmie Heuga, Jean-Claude Killy and Suzy Chaffee battled for podiums.\nAdvertisement Portillo, only a few hours from the Santiago airport (and 29 exposed, stomach-churning switchbacks that local colectivo drivers maneuver like Blue Angel pilots), is a decades-old favorite training ground for nearly all the world's ski teams. Thick-thighed racers from all over rally at the Hotel Portillo every year, getting their ski legs back after a brief summer break. They streak down the slopes, practicing their tucks and pre-jumps on lonely runs that don't even need to be closed to accommodate their speedy descents. The resort has daily slalom races for guests, a nod to its ski-racing heritage.\nWhile the Hotel Portillo is a gem, the alpine terrain is the main attraction at this quiet outpost near a heavily trafficked pass that connects Chile with Argentina. The ski area's 1,200 acres feature plenty of steeps and dicey traverses accessing powder-filled bowls that draw hordes of ski-jonesing gringos every summer. The area's 14 chairlifts include slingshot platters that zip as many as five skiers at a time up the steepest terrain. The ridiculously rowdy ride itself is thrilling. Exiting the dangling platters on near-vertical ice is an exercise in adrenaline management.\nA sparkling pool at the Portillo resort in Chile. ( Jesse Hoffman, Special to The Denver Post ) Portillo's hike-to terrain — including the iconic Super C Couloir, a must-hit on every big-mountain skier's dream list — is limitless, with scary sidestepping paths leading to the most daunting yet picturesque lines in South America.\nAt higher elevations, hiking skiers are rewarded with a close-up view of Aconcagua, the majestic 22,837-foot peak that ranks as the highest mountain outside Asia. While the views are striking, it's fun to scan the ground as you hike. The mountaintops are littered with fossilized sea shells, dating back to when those sky-scraping peaks were a beach.\nIt's not uncommon to bump into skiers you see in magazines and movies while hiking around Portillo. Peek into a rocky overhang to find a plaque memorializing the late Shane McConkey, a legend whose skiing prowess (and Portillo antics) still reverberate through the high Andes. A moment with the plaque will push skiers into deeper challenges, following McConkey's soul-swelling creed to squeeze \"maximum enjoyment\" from life.\nWhile each week's stay includes four meals a day, many guests gather at Tío Bob's for lunches that too easily turn into a three-bottle-or-more afternoon. Overlooking the Lake of the Incas — easily one of the best vistas in skiing — Tío Bob's is a must-taste tradition for Portillo visitors.\nThe hotel is a respite from the bustling, ubiquitous ski villages way north, because there is no village. Portillo really is a cruise ship, moored at 9,450 feet in the world's longest mountain range. There's nowhere to wander and if you ski Portillo the right way, your legs won't be eager to amble much farther than the bar or the wood-paneled great room. Afternoon tea — really a cocktail hour — fosters a United Nations-type mingling among Portillo's diverse guests. Ladies from Texas chat with Ukrainian bankers and Hong Kong doctors take selfies with their favorite Portillo servers. Austrian ski racers sign autographs and ski school instructors — many of them pro-level skiers — are embraced like long-lost kin. Really, each week at Portillo is a homecoming of sorts, as the same guests seem to return at the same time, creating a family-reunion feel.\nThe absence of televisions in the hotel rooms encourages that communal vibe. The hotel lobby is a vibrant great room with people playing games, reading books and hanging out at all hours. Rooms seem reserved solely for sleeping.\nDinners are served community style, with large tables further encouraging a blending of guests dressed in their Sunday best, lending a formal air to the evening supper. Movies in the theater and a basement gymnasium keep the kids entertained while grown-ups labor to tint their teeth Malbec red at the hotel's bar and discotheque.\nOh, if the walls could talk in those speakeasies. Live bands in the piano bar rattle the hotel lobby after dinner while hotel guests pre-game for the late-night shenanigans in the basement disco. Ladies dancing on tables is a nightly occurrence in the piano bar, a primer for the all-night boogie down in the disco. It's what creates comedy later, during the Saturday shift change at Portillo — thigh-ravaged, bleary-eyed, goggle-tanned guests are replaced with fresh-faced newcomers eager to sport that same grinning wobble a week later.\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasonblevins\nSki Portillo\nPortillo is holding its 2014 prices through 2015, with packages that include seven nights lodging, four meals a day, child care for kids 4-7 and lift tickets, starting at $2,100.
