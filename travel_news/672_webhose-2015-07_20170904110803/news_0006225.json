The most common product is ZMA, a widely available supplement sold on the shelves of most stores and pharmacies. These natural products include Tribulus Terrestris and Eurycoma Longifolia extract, amongst others. However, one class of hormone booster that is gaining massive popularity locally and abroad are hGH boosters. Until very recently growth hormone was only available in injectable form, but advances in science and technology have given rise to a number of hGH precursor products that now come in a variety of advanced delivery systems. The most popular means of taking growth hormone boosters today include sub-lingual sprays, which are sprayed into the mouth, homeopathic pills and capsules containing hGH precursors and secretagogues. Just like testosterone boosters, hGH boosters and precursors are used to stimulate the natural secretion of hGH from the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. This is generally done through the combination of a number of amino acids, the most important being L-glutamine, L-arginine, L-ornithine and L-lysine, along with growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRPs). According to Mark Sowter, a local manufacturer of a growth hormone release programme called R3-Life, “certain amino acids have a synergistic effect on each other when combined in certain ratios, as opposed to using them individually,” he explains. “This basically means that the sum of its parts is greater than the whole, or more simply put, 1+1=3. As an example, arginine AAKG, which is far better than the HCL version due to its high bio-availability, increases the release of hGH in its own right. However, when you combine ornithine and lysine with it, it boosts the effect of the arginine by about four times. Glutamine is also an important amino acid as it both enhances muscular protein synthesis and increases circulating growth hormone levels, so it is an essential ingredient to have in any HGH booster amino acid stack.” The combination of “ \nTestosterone boosters have been around, in some form or another, for many years, as there are many substances, both natural and synthetic, that claim to boost circulating levels of testosterone.

The pituitary response system is up-regulated by hGH boosters as they increase the release of powerful substances called secretagogues, which prompt the endocrine system to secrete hormones, in this case growth hormone. The secretagogues that stimulate hGH production are also said to suppress somatostatin production, which is a hormone produced by a number of organs in the body that inhibits the secretion of growth hormone. \nHaving established the internal process it is important to understand that hGH boosters do not contain actual growth hormones, as this is an illegal substance when used outside of clinical settings for therapeutic purposes. They merely help the body to increase the secretion of growth hormones, so if a manufacturer claims to have abnormal levels of actual hGH, it is either disinformation designed to mislead consumers or the manufacturer is breaking the law. \nTo read more about my journey, please visit one of my friend's website. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T08:57:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
