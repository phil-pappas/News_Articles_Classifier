This has focused on European markets such as Spain, Germany and France – plus long haul destinations including the East Coast of the United States and Asia (primarily India and Japan).\nWelcome to More highlights the transformation the city is experiencing, with over £1 billion in investment now coming to fruition. It encompasses everything the city region will have to offer – from the £600 million redevelopment of New Street station, to major cultural events including the Birmingham Weekender and The Big Hoot.\nThe microsite will become a central information point, providing further details about the milestones taking place across the local area. Marketing Birmingham has developed a range of other tools for Welcome to More, including a downloadable festivals planner, digital advertising campaign and door drop leaflets targeting national audiences who can take a direct train journey into Birmingham city centre. A social media campaign will be using the hashtag #morebirmingham.\nThe microsite also complements the content already available for stakeholders on the Birmingham Toolkit. Local organisations can download tools such as factsheets, a press pack, digital banners and an events calendar to help them sell Birmingham as a global destination to visit, invest and meet.\nInvolving a range of local partners, Welcome to More has already helped to raise awareness of the area with UK and international audiences. Rough Guides has listed Birmingham as one of the world’s top ten destinations to visit in 2015, while the city attracted a record 48 foreign direct investment projects in 2014/15.\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:15:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
