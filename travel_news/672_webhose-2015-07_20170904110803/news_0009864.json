Manchester also had a strong performance a record 22.3 million people passing through the airport. \nChief executive Charlie Cornish, said: “Our airports have a vital role to play in the next 10-15 years as London expands eastwards, the Northern Powerhouse becomes a reality and runway capacity in the south-east becomes even scarcer. \n“Following the Airports Commission’s submission of its final report, it is imperative that the focus of government and other stakeholders is on the practical steps needed to maximise the potential of existing airport capacity in the period before any new runway is completed. \n“We continue to request that government and Network Rail apply greater efforts to improve the rail links into Stansted and Manchester, which together can accommodate an extra 50-60 million passengers a year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T15:12:24.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
