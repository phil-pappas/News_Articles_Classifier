It doesn't get much better than the glamorous Goring. \nFrightfully posh, but never pretentious, this London institution impresses with old-world charm. \nTHE PLACE The Goring, London \nTHE LOCATION Want to feel like royalty? It doesn't get much better than the glamorous Goring. It was a firm favourite of the Queen Mother and is still the only hotel with a royal warrant from the queen. \nThe hotel was booked by the Middleton family in the lead-up to Kate and William's wedding in 2011. You can see why. It's just a few minutes from Buckingham Palace, moments from Victoria Station, and discreetly located down a quiet, leafy street, away from prying eyes. \nThe Duchess of Cambridge recently returned to the hotel, eight months pregnant, for the unveiling of an extensive renovation. \nTHE SPACE Immaculately dressed attendants welcome you to an exclusive world of very British luxury. The revamped lobby has a lavish new mural, featuring hidden caricatures of owner Jeremy Goring and his awarded staff. \nThe Gorings have run the place since its opening in 1910 and it's London's last remaining family-owned luxury hotel, known as a \"Baby Grand\", with just 69 heritage suites and rooms over five floors. \nTHE KIT An oversized brass key opens the door to one of four opulent one-bedroom Belgravia suites, fitted out by renowned designer Russell Sage. Ad Feedback \nThe compact reception area leads to an elegant sitting room with full fireplace, silk-swathed walls, sumptuous couches and tall, curtained windows peering over Beeston Place. \nA glittering marble bathroom has all the trimmings including a walk-in shower, flat-screen TV and a raft of Molton Brown products. Heaven. \nThe bedroom is tastefully decked out with glossy wood furniture, and features a quirky set of lighting modes: bright, calm, cosy or the suggestive \"oooh!\". \nAn imposing king-sized bed is smothered in Egyptian cotton, with a signature Goring \"Baaa-bara Sheep\" stuffed toy perched on the pillow; there's one in every room. \nA Belgravia suite at The Goring. \nCOMFORT FACTOR On arrival, I'm whisked to the lounge to fill out my details over what might be the world's finest cup of English breakfast tea. From here on, the service is faultless, if overly formal. Every staff member remembers my name; nothing is too much trouble; and I have a dedicated footman who mixes a stiff Cosmopolitan in the suite at 5pm. \nA footman at The Goring \nFOOD Pull out the stops and enjoy a grand dinner from new chef Shay Cooper in the softly hued, extravagantly chandeliered dining room (designed by the queen's nephew, Viscount Linley). \nA fleet of tux-and-tails waiters are almost comically accommodating as they serve up sublime beef Wellington, sliced at the table, foie gras pate, triple-cooked chips, house-baked onion bread, luxe puddings and delicious French burgundy. \nThe hotel also offers a full English breakfast, a set lunch menu, classic afternoon tea (this is ground zero for cucumber sandwiches), and a full bar with plentiful snacks. It's all beautifully done. \nAfternoon tea on the terrace. \nSTEPPING OUT Being in the heart of \"sloane-y\" Belgravia means you're right in the thick of the capital's finest attractions, but this is where the well-heeled come to be spoiled. Nurse a G & T on the verandah overlooking the velvety Goring Gardens, and you'll hardly want to leave. \nTHE VERDICT A night at The Goring is a seriously special occasion, like stepping into a scene from Downton Abbey: The Royal Wedding Spectacular. It's frightfully posh, vividly historic, yet somehow maintains a down-to-earth sense of humour about proceedings. It's the definition of a classic five-star hotel. \nESSENTIALS Rates for a Belgravia Suite start from Â£1340 (NZ$3150) per night, excluding breakfast. 15 Beeston Place, London, SW1, see thegoring.com \nThe writer was a guest of The Goring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T03:43:11.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
