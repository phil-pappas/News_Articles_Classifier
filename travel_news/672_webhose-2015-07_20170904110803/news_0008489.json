As Australian football gets closer to suffocating on the debate about “the look of the game”, the former St Kilda mentor wants to hold his collegiate brothers to account for where the AFL is tracking.\nActually, the man most missed from Channel 9’s Footy Classified each Monday, wants the media to put the AFL coaches in the dock – during the “Fifth Quarter” in the post game.\nHe even sent the questions, demanding current-day AFL coaches be grilled on why they have turned elite Australian football into a stoppage game.\n“Un-Australian,” Thomas says with a tag that always draws attention.\nThere were 76 stoppages at Adelaide Oval on Saturday – 35 in the centre square to start terms and restart after goals.\nOf the 41 in field play, Crows midfielder Patrick Dangerfield’s attack on a field bounce and instant kick for a goal in the third term proved there can be beauty in set plays.\nInto the firing line at the end of the game came Gold Coast coach Rodney Eade.\nHe is now the AFL’s most-experienced coach – the only mentor from the 1990s. He also is one of the greatest tacticians of the VFL’s expansion era since 1987.\nAnd he does not dismiss Thomas’ charge that coaches are changing the look of Australian football – and embracing the stoppage game.\n“No doubt,” Eade says. “The coach’s reference point is defence; you don’t want to be scored against. That’s why we send numbers back to stoppages (creating congestion). It is not so much to open the front end (of the field). It’s about making sure the opposition don’t score.”\nEade does not walk away from Thomas’ charge that coaches engineer more and more stoppages to gain a tactical edge.\nAnd it is worth reviewing Eade’s prediction on what happens to AFL games if, as expected, interchange rotations are reduced from today’s 120 cap to 60 next season.\n“Players will be fatigued – and they can’t come off for a rest and they won’t rest in a forward pocket,” Eade said.\n“There will be more stoppages. We will want to slow down the game – we will not want it to become quick.\n“People expect more ball-ups. No, there will be more boundary throw-ins. That’s what will increase. When you have one stoppage, it is easy to create a second and a third.\n“If there is a cap at 60 rotations, teams will go flat-out for 10 minutes, rope-a-dope for 10 minutes, then go quick for five and slow it down again. There will be more numbers behind the ball.\n“Coaches won’t let it be six forwards against six backs with 60 interchanges. They will not let players become fatigued – and stoppages are not as taxing.”\nEade made the interesting observation that “rusted-on” fans are “critical of the look of the game but still come along”.\n“It is the 12-to-30-year-olds who need instant gratification, more entertainment than ever before who we need to attract and keep more interested than ever before,” says Eade.\nThomas has his answers now.\nWHAT WE LEARNED\nHAWTHORN is on track to become the greatest team of all time with a dynasty of four AFL premierships in eight seasons. So much for that AFL system of equalisation that was supposed to stop super teams…\nRant with Rucci (Frame content direct link: http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1400367 .)", "external_links": ["http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1400367"], "published": "2015-07-27T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T15:27:42.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
