Take a visit to these destinations and make good and ever lasting memories. \nFor a traveller nothing beats the lust to explore. Very few brave the rains as the water puddles, the mud and the constant rains sometimes soothing and sometimes harsh are not ideal conditions for holidays for everyone. After research and chats with travellers I have created a list of holiday destinations to visit in India during Monsoon. Holiday packages in India are the cheapest in this season and with so few tourist crowds the journey is hassle free and perfect for soul searching. \nHere is my list of Top 10: \n1. Leh-Ladakh: The cold desert rarely receives rains. The high altitudes, the adventure to survive and the breathtaking views ensure its place on the top of my list. Monsoon is the best time at it is the only time you can travel to the unexplored difficult terrain. \n2. Goa: The beaches are inaccessible but the allure is no less. Churches, Spice plantations, wildlife sanctuaries, the Dudhsagar Falls, the adventure sports and not to forget the season of discounts puts Goa second on my list. \n3. Cherrapunjee, Meghalaya: Rains are best enjoyed where it rains the most in India and that puts Cherrapunjee, Meghalaya on my list. Lush greenery, streams, misty clouds and living root bridges, do I need to say some more? \n4. Kerala: Seeing a picture of rain-wash Kerala in my childhood had made its place in my heart. So much lush greenery, network of backwaters, hill station, beaches and everything in one place truly called Godâ€™s Own Country. With information collected, monsoon is perfect for Ayurveda and the exciting snake boat races. \n5. Pondicherry: Monsoon in the former French colony along the sea where stay, food, travelling is pocket friendly puts Pondy on my list. A free stay in Aurobindo Ashram and the cheap food and drinks will make holiday magical. \n6. \n9. Western Ghats, Maharashtra: The Western Ghats in the state of Maharashtra is the most beautiful destination for monsoon holidays. There are various hill stations, forts, waterfalls, peaks and various scenic pleasures for nature lovers   \n\nHi, I am Parul Upadhyay. I am a traveler and blogger.
