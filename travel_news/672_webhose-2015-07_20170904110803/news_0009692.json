But that is impossible because I'm not breathing. \nMy world has shrunk to a few square metres. I am locked in a rusty iron cage with a one-tonne beast. To be precise, I am straddled upon its wide shoulders. As I rise and fall with each powerful rasping breath beneath me, I begin to question the impulse to fulfil my fantasy of living the cowboy life. The warmth of the animal's skin permeates my jeans and I feel the prickle of its hide along with the prickle of my rising fear. \nNeil Ratley hangs on for the ride of his life. \nI wrap the rope around my gloved hand and manage to briefly lift my eyes for a glimpse around the chute. Outback cowboys, wearing weathered hats and even more weathered faces, are perched on the railings shouting last minute advice. The only sound I hear is the pounding of my heart. Then the chute flies open and my chance for eight seconds of glory comes rushing at me. \nIt's the dry season in the Australian Outback and also rodeo season. Across the endless horizons of this sunburnt country, cities, towns and isolated communities double in size as the rodeo comes to town. From the largest rodeo event in the southern hemisphere in Mount Isa - known as the Rodeo Capital of Australia - to remote outposts that don't even merit a mark on a road map. Places with names like Dajarra, Sedan Dip and Quamby. Where the rodeo is the highlight of the year for those working and living on the harsh and often unforgiving land. \nThrough the dry and dusty winter months the spurs of cowboys and cowgirls from near and far can be heard jangling as they follow the Outback rodeo circuit. NEIL RATEY/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Outback mining town of Mount Isa, in northwest Queensland, is considered the rodeo capital of Australia. \nThe biggest draw card for cowboys and fans is the Mount Isa Rodeo. Held annually during the second weekend of August, the multi-day event is the richest rodeo south of the equator. It lures the country's best professional rodeo riders along with international competitors from the US, Canada, Brazil and New Zealand. Also in the mix for the lucrative prize money are the amateur Outback cowboys who normally make a living mustering stock instead of riding it. \nMount Isa is a mining town in northwest Queensland. It is a 900km drive inland from the port city of Townsville along an old pioneering route known as the Overlander's Way. Approaching Mount Isa, the road winds its way through the spectacular Selwyn Ranges where rugged red hills contrast with huge white gum trees. My first glimpse of Australia's Rodeo Capital is two tall stacks puffing plumes of smoke into the expansive blue sky. \nDigging up zinc ore from the earth's crust is the lifeblood of Mount Isa but during the \"Isa Rodeo\" miners' hard hats are swapped for cowboy hats. The dust from the rodeo arena replaces the dust normally stirred up from the vast open cut Black Star mine on the edge of the city. Spectators cheer on the action wearing a second skin the colour of rust and wash the taste of grit out of their mouths with a cold can of XXXX beer. NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nThe smoke stacks from the Black Star open-cut mine stand like sentinels in Mount Isa. \nOn a cloudless winter day, the sun rides higher in sky. Belt buckles glisten and cowboy hats - newly bought for the occasion or well worn by years of faithful service - keep the glare at bay. Ad Feedback \nBehind the chutes the bull riders jangle and jostle in a nervous dance as they each wait their turn for what some commentators have labelled the most dangerous eight seconds in sport. It is a confined atmosphere of tension, excitement and bravado fragranced by a smell of leather and sweat as Suicidal Blonde, Evil Eyes, Wild Thing and Arachnophobia are introduced to the crowd. \nThe fate and adulation of a bull rider is tied to his bull by more than just a rope wrapped around his wrist. While eight ticks of the second hand is the ultimate focus for a rider, the ferocity of the ride is also used for scoring and ultimately determines the champion. NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nBullfighters wait to leap into action if needed to protect man from beast. \nThe action is fast and furious and riders and bulls share the honours. The bravest people in the arena – the rodeo clowns or, as they prefer to be called, bullfighters – leap to the aid of fallen riders and place themselves between the bull's horns and the prostrate cowboy. The ground barely stops shaking before the bulls are back in their holding pens and it is the bronco riders that thrill the crowd. Leaning back, horizontal in the saddle or on the bare back of their mounts, the riders are a blur with one hand roped to the bronco and the other outstretched, reaching for the outback sun as it sinks into the west. \nProfessional Australian cowboy Toby Collins, who is trying to crack the big time in the lucrative circuit in the US, rides broncos and bulls. As a rider is bucked from his bronco and flies through the air landing with a thud in front of me, I recall Collins' wry grin when he contemplates which ride is less likely to end badly. \"I can't decide which is more dangerous. You have the feeling a bull may want to hurt you more, especially when it gets you on the ground. But it's a long way to fall from a bronco.\" \nThe Mount Isa Rodeo may be the most famous in Queensland's interior but the other rodeos across the parched and ruddy Outback are just as important for the isolated communities. NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nAirborne action in the bronco riding at the Dajarra Rodeo. \nMany of the small towns - and places that don't have enough houses or residents to even be called a small town - host their own rodeos. These events are often the highlight of the year and draw cowboys from outlying stations and nearby towns (where nearby is often a few days drive). What they lack in size and facilities, they certainly make up for in pioneer spirit. \nDajarra is 156km south of Mount Isa and the population struggles to match the number of kilometres separating the two. The tarred road is dotted with roadkill, a testament to the unflinching and unyielding nature of the famous triple-trailer roadtrains that truck cattle in these parts. However, the rocky ochre outcrops, smooth boulders, cities of termite mounds and endless ocean of land easily draw the eyes away to less grisly sights. \nWith the sun setting in the west, my posse and I are glad to pull off the road. Kangaroos, the predominant form of roadkill, are more active on the roads at dusk and pose a real threat to a driver in a vehicle with less than 18 wheels. NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nTermite mounds rise like city skyscrapers in the Outback. \nLike many such establishments in the Outback, the Dajarra Hotel is the heart and soul of the community, and the night before the local rodeo, the hotel's patrons are spilling out into the street. The beer is flowing and feats of rodeo fame are being feted before a bull or bronco has been bested. \nDajarra was once reputedly the largest trucking depot in the world. Those who remember say the area trucked more cattle than Texas. Tonight, with stock trucks and utes lining the street outside the pub, it is not hard to imagine such a time. \nThe town also has a rich indigenous heritage and is home to aboriginal tribes from around the Diamantina River, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Northern Territory. Young, rangy cowboys slouch around the jukebox and shoot pool. Easy smiles shine beneath Akubras and Stetsons and a respectful jeer goes up when an aboriginal elder asks for a song. Someone puts his coin in the jukebox and the hip-hop is broken for four-and-a-half minutes by U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For . NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nRoad trains are an integral part of the Australian Outback, just like kangaroos, red dust and endless horizons. \nDajarra's few streets are deserted when we emerge from our swags (a bedroll) to the laughter of a kookaburra in an old gum tree. Every man, woman, child and dog are drawn to the small copper-coloured earthen ring beneath a copse of gum trees enclosed by a fence to keep the crowd separated from the bulls and broncos. \nI sign the waiver as I nominate myself to be flung from the haunches of an angry cow. The decision to voluntary surrender my rights to blame anyone but myself for my temporary insanity hits me when I watch a bronco rider catapult from his steed and crash into the fence. Eventually he is helped to his feet, dusts himself off and receives the adulation of the crowd. And the rodeo bucks on. \nThe rodeo caller crackles over the ancient sound system. It's time for me to take the ride of my life. I climb into the mounting yard. NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nA young Aboriginal cowboy prepares to compete in the junior events of the Mount Isa Rodeo in Outback Australia. \nA collection of smiles flash from the corral of cowboys behind the chutes. Some are missing a few teeth but all appear thick with enthusiasm (to see an idiot trampled), support (to see an idiot trampled) and a little contempt (to see an idiot wanting to get trampled). \nBen, a cowboy and stockman from a station between Dajarra and Mount Isa, kindly offers to be my flank man. He will fit the bull rope around my beast and make sure I at least make it out the chute. Ben also lends me his Kevlar vest and glove. Apparently it's wiser for a novice bull rider to wear more than a hat, a pair of jeans and a brightly coloured shirt. \nThere is a fast rhythmic thumping against the vest. If it wasn't made of material to stop a bullet I'm sure my heart would launch out from my chest. I scramble up the railings of the chute and down onto the bull. I feel it shudder beneath me and realise the enormity of my situation and the animal I am perched upon. The shouts of encouragement raining down on me from above blend into an incomprehensible downpour. Ben slaps my back and I jolt back from the special place my mind had tried to escape to. \"Sit forward, chest out and hang on.\" NEIL RATLEY/ FAIRFAX NZ \nA future rodeo star leaves the Dajarra arena. \nA final thought goes through my mind. \"How do I get off if I last eight seconds?\" The answer is the same way you get off when you last 2.12 seconds. \nAfter surviving a sway and a twist, it is not glory that rushes at me at the first sign of a buck from my bull. It is the red dirt. I don't feel the impact but I feel the breeze of the bulky bovine blow over the top of me. The bullfighters draw its attention away so I can scramble to my feet and over the railings to safety. \nBehind the sanctuary of the fence I check that my limbs are still attached to my body and start to dust myself off before I pause for a while. The fine layer of crimson earth I now wear from head to foot is in a way symbolic of my time in the vast expanses of the Outback, amidst its rugged beauty and among the people who call this sunburnt country home. At the makeshift bar, cans of beer sit in old bathtubs filled with ice. I let the frosty tin soothe a hoof print on my leg before allowing the amber fluid to wash the grit from my dry mouth. After the first sip, I realise I am breathing again. \nNeil Ratley's shot at rodeo glory ends in the dust and dirt. \nGETTING THERE \nMount Isa is located in northwest Queensland, 900km inland from Townsville along the Overlander's Way and is easily accessed by direct flights from Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Darwin, Townsville and Cairns, as well as by road and bus. \nQantas and Virgin fly from Brisbane to Mount Isa. \nThe dry season of May to October (Australian Winter) is the best time to visit the Outback. \nWHEN TO GO \nBoulia Camel Races – July 17 - July 19 \nQuamby Rodeo – July 25 \nCloncurry - Curry Merry Muster Festival – July 31- August 2 \nMount Isa Rodeo – August 7-9 \nSedan Dip Campdraft & Rodeo – August 21-23 \nBirdsville Races – September 4-5 \nDajarra Rodeo – September 18 -20 - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:42:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
