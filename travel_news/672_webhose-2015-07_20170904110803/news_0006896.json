Bleh. Lufthansa's inflight menu may include Butterfly Dream (gnocchetti pasta salad with shrimp) or Potato Sunset (wedges with tomato sauce). Last year, the airline served more than 30,000 kids' meals that were \"free of excess fat and high calories,\" says LATAM's executive chef Hugo Pantano.\n\"We want children to receive a meal that is both attractive to them, while still being healthy,\" he says.\nMeanwhile, for Lufthansa it's all about colors.\nTheir latest kids' meal creations are by German star chef Sybille Schoenberger, an enthusiastic amateur painter who loves color -- both on canvas and on the inflight meal tray.\nForget chicken or fish: today's inflight menu may include Butterfly Dream (gnocchetti pasta salad with shrimp), Potato Sunset (wedges with tomato sauce) or Flying Dumplings (white bread and cheese dumplings on mushroom ragout).\n\"Each of our star chefs must have previous experience with cooking for kids,\" says Martin Riecken, director of corporate communications for Lufthansa in Europe.\n\"After the menus have been designed by the star chef, a jury of children from different countries decides which children's menus will be served on board Lufthansa flights.\"\nPlayful packaging and organic snacks\nKids flying Air France can play with their food thanks to Catalan designer Eugeni Quitllet, who created a spoon, fork and knife that can be transformed into a small aircraft.\nOn flights longer than 150 minutes, the airline offers organic baby food in jars, while kids' meals on flights from Paris include three items that are organic -- usually orange juice, compote and a chocolate bar.\nNot flying from Paris?\nThe airline will still offer at least one organic snack for children.\nKids aged 2-8 will automatically be ordered a kids' meal during the flight booking process, but as with any special meal request, it's always good to confirm with the airline before departure.\nOrganic snacks for children are even offered on low cost airline EasyJet.\nThe airline recently redesigned its kids' inflight snack box.\nBy removing chips and chocolate bars, the airline achieved a 4% reduction in fat, 40% reduction in saturated fat and an increase of 20% in fiber.\nThe range of Organix Goodies (which promises to use all natural products) now used in the snack box satisfied the airline's procurement team, who wanted to ensure tasty, healthy and nutritious products for their young fliers.\nAll snacks are packaged individually, so they can be eaten during the flight or later.\n\"But, Mom, I don't like caviar!\"\nThough they'll likely enjoy the extra room for their toys, chances are most kids sitting in first or business class won't appreciate dishes such as lobster thermidor or caviar service.\nOn Singapore Airlines, first-class kids too good for caviar can order mac and cheese instead. That's why Singapore Airlines introduced its \"Yummy\" inflight meal service: a meal pre-order program available for children flying suites/first and business class.\nParents can select an inflight meal that will appeal to their child, with more than 15 kid-friendly options including mac and cheese, pancakes and sausages, and healthy options like poached eggs, grilled fish or roasted chicken.\nEach month, up to 300 parents pre-order these meals for their children, but that monthly figure more than doubles to 800-plus during the peak school vacation period, says the airline.\nSome hold the healthy food\nKLM took a different approach to inflight kids' meals by running a series of nine special test flights where parents and kids were surveyed to determine exactly what food and toys should be offered.\nThe airline serves more than 60,000 hungry young travelers each year, so it was important to get it right.\n\"We found that children do not like healthy food inflight,\" explains Madeleine Braun, product manager for KLM Long Haul.\n\"Therefore, parents would rather have them eating anything at all (even unhealthy) instead of pushing them to eat something healthy they don't like.\"\nArmed with that information, the airline set out to please young fliers with options such as hamburgers with fries and a typically Dutch breakfast of \"poffertjes\" baby pancakes.\nKLM also found that kids love to copy adults, so they created a range of eye masks and baggage labels to include in kids' inflight kits.\nHope your kid likes the color pink\nLast, but certainly not least, is the happiest flight of them all: EVA Air's Hello Kitty Jets.\nThe Kitty flight experience has more than 100 branded inflight Hello Kitty items, including headrest covers, blankets, pillows and inflight meals, of course.\nHello Kitty jet inflight cuisine is colorful, with kids' meals served in Chef Hello Kitty boxes with bowtie-shaped bowls.\nThese items are available on select flights to/from Los Angeles, Houston, Paris, Singapore, Seoul, Fukuoka, Sapporo, Guam or Tokyo to Seoul (and vice versa).", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121538-airport-kids-food--lufthansa-kids-business-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150724121542-airport-kids-food--mac-and-cheese-full-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T05:39:55.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
