This extensive work would normally take about four and a half months to complete during routine train operation.\n“The Maintenance Jamboree is a great testament to the dedication of our employees, who pull together to complete the work of many months in just a few short days to reduce the impact on our customers and communities,” said Oscar Munoz, president and chief operating officer. “During the Jamboree, and all year long, CSX is committed to investing in our network to provide safe and efficient rail transportation today and serve freight demand in the future.”\nThe 2015 Maintenance Jamboree, which ran from June 29 to July 6, involved fourteen production teams, as well as engineering, signal and bridge teams. Track work concentrated on two key southeastern corridors: between Shelby, Ky., and Spartanburg, S.C., and between Bostic, N.C., and Monroe, N.C.\nCSX has celebrated this annual safety and maintenance blitz since 1999, when a CSX machine operator coined the term “Jamboree” to describe the mass gathering of maintenance-of-way crews and equipment in one area. The Maintenance Jamboree is one example of CSX’s commitment to investing in its infrastructure. In 2015, CSX will invest more than $2.5 billion in capital throughout its network.\nRelated Posts Expanded Train Services From Decmber 2013 – Scot Rail Energy recovery for metro trains and suburban trains is gathering speed Dangerous behaviour at level crossings caught on dash cam Siemens to realign regional organization and strengthen corporate units Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T11:28:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
