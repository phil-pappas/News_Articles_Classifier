It won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and the all-star cast, including Paul Newman, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, also impressed. Subsequent real-life events, however, and those vivid pictures of fireballs engulfing the Twin Towers, make this fictional plot more chilling than thrilling. Fury (2014) Sky Movies Premiere, 8.00pm Writer-director David Ayer’s study of the habits and habitats of the American killer male is an astonishing, stirring drama. It’s Germany 1945, and Sgt Don “Wardaddy” Collie (Brad Pitt) and his team are grinding towards Berlin in a battered M4 Sherman tank. There is no rescue mission, just an agonising rumble from one brush with death to the next. The set-piece battles are gripping, and the raw terror of war is blasted home. Rock Around the Clock (1956, b/w) BBC Four, 10.00pm Detecting a declining interest in big band music, band manager Steve Hollis (Johnny Johnston) hopes that a new band he’s discovered will be the next big thing in the States. Featuring real-life rock ’n’ roll band Bill Haley & His Comets, this is a heavily embellished telling of the genre’s origin. As expected, the musical interludes provide a lot of the film’s pleasure, but this is ultimately too cheesy to be taken seriously. Flatliners (1990) BBC One, 11.55pm Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon show flashes of their talent in this supernatural thriller about a group of medical students who start using a drug to “flatline” for a few moments before being revived, all in the name of research. But their plan backfires when their bad memories take human form and haunt them. It’s both creepy and stylish but, funnily enough, a bit flat. Wimbledon (2004) ITV3, 12.10am Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst turn out to be the perfect match in this sporting romance. For ageing British tennis player Peter Colt (Bettany) the only love he’s getting is in his matches, until he meets American star player Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst). This is a romcom by numbers, à la Richard Curtis’s Notting Hill, but the tennis scenes are realistic enough, and by the end of the film you’re rooting for Bettany to win on all fronts.

Still, the mixture of cute and weird sometimes pays off, and Robert Helpmann’s Child Catcher is truly the stuff of nightmares. The Longest Day (1962, b/w) More4, 4.25pm This fact–based Second World War drama has a simple aim: to tell the story of the Normandy landings in the round. Epic in scale and scope, with three directors and no less than five writers, it depicts both the Allied and the Nazi points of view. It also stars a who’s who of Sixties leading men, including John Wayne, Richard Burton and even a cameo from Sean Connery. A classic of its kind, if very long. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) ITV, 7.00pm Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back and makes his presence felt in this adaptation of JK Rowling’s penultimate book of the series. His creepy followers have rejoined him but, as the big battle looms, the teenagers in Hogwarts first have to fight their hormones. This Potter film stands head and shoulders above the previous five and is terrific entertainment. Plus, the special-effects are wonderful. Grand Prix (1966) BBC Two, 11.45pm There have been several high-profile attempts at motor racing movies, but none has matched this drama for visual impact. If the footage seems less impressive today, it’s because a domestic TV cannot do justice to the film’s super-widescreen Cinerama format, which director John Frankenheimer exploited to the full with split-screen techniques and in-car footage. It stars James Garner and Eva Marie Saint.

The setting this time is the chaotic mudbath of a farm where a mother (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is struggling to cope with three of her own children and two prissy, spoilt-brat cousins evacuated from wartime London. Charming family fun. John Carter (2012) BBC Two, 6.00pm Taylor Kitsch plays a Civil War captain accidentally transported to Mars in this affectionate adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s sci-fi yarn, the live-action directing debut of Finding Nemo’s Andrew Stanton. Critics hated it but watch with an open mind, and you’ll be rewarded with thrilling setpieces as our hero hooks up with a smart Princess (Lynn Collins) and helps the Tharks fight against the Zodangans. Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) BBC Four, 10.00pm Julie Christie is luminous as Bathsheba in this adaptation of Hardy’s novel, in which director John Schlesinger grounds the personalities of the central love quadrangle firmly in mud. Wessex, meanwhile, is superbly captured in Nicolas Roeg’s colour photography. This might be considered a classic but Thomas Vinterberg’s recent remake is just as powerful. The Grey (2011) Channel 4, 10.00pm Liam Neeson plays a worker on an Alaskan oilrig, who, while desperately missing his mysteriously absent wife, is suddenly pitched into the raw business of pure survival. The film hovers somewhere between thriller and horror, and despite possessing the starkest of pitches (a bunch of frightened men are hunted down by wolves) manages to sustain apprehension and a sinking sense of inevitability in the viewer.

These include priest Robert Beatty and the excellent Simone Signoret in her first English–language film role. There’s some pertinent use of documentary footage and a few nail–biting moments, though the fragmented plot zigzags too distractedly. Hanover Street (1979) Film4, 4.40pm Harrison Ford stars as David Halloran, an American bomber pilot based in the UK, in this wartime romance. A chance meeting with Margaret (Lesley–Anne Down),a beautiful British nurse, soon turns into a love affair. Unfortunately Margaret is already married, and her husband turns out to be Halloran’s partner for an upcoming assignment. Watch out fora very young Patsy Kensit. The Riot Club (2014) Sky Movies Premiere, 8.00pm Laura Wade’s 2010 play, Posh, dealt with a still-reported habit of trashing dining establishments at the Oxford University’s notorious Bullingdon Club. It reaches the screen as The Riot Club, starring a braying gang of silverspoon-reared Brits. The pungency of the play has been diluted, along with its political bite, but Holliday Grainger, Max Irons and Sam Claflin are perfectly cast in the main roles. Jaws 2 (1978) ITV4, 11.00pm Featuring one of the best taglines in cinema history (“Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water”), this inferior sequel to Steven Spielberg’s 1975 classic still has enough redeeming qualities to make it a decent watch (and it’s much better than the other sequels). Set four years after the original, the film finds Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) realising he has another killer shark on his hands when divers go missing. Also available on free-to-air channels: Channel 5 15.15 The Trail to Hope Rose (David S Cass Snr, 2004) Film4 11.00 3:10 to Yuma (Delmer Daves, 1957) 12.50 Guadalcanal Diary (Lewis Seiler, 1943) 14.40 Destry Rides Again (George Marshall, 1939) 18.50 Step Up (Anne Fletcher, 2006) 21.00 GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra (Stephen Sommers, 2009) 23.15 Animal Kingdom (David Michod, 2010) 1.30 Everything Put Together (Marc Forster, 1999) 5USA 12.35 Attack on the Iron Coast (Paul Wendkos, 1968) 14.30 Seminole Uprising (Earl Bellamy, 1955) Movie Mix 9.00 Touching Wild Horses (Eleanor Lindo, 2002) 11.00 The Cup (Simon Wincer, 2011) 13.00 Jakob the Liar (Peter Kassovitz, 1999) 15.20 White Lion: Home Is a Journey (Michael Swan, 2010) 17.15 Our Wild Hearts (Ricky Schroder, 2013) 19.05 Little Nikita (Richard Benjamin, 1988) 21.00 The Liability (Craig Viveiros, 2012) 22.50 White Men Can't Jump (Ron Shelton, 1992) 1.15 The Hot Potato (Tim Lewiston, 2011) 3.30 The John Sullivan Story (David Stevens, 1979) Movies4Men 15.05 Five Golden Dragons (Jeremy Summers, 1967) 17.05 Return of the Bad Men (Ray Enright, 1948) 18.50 Buck and the Preacher (Sidney Poitier, 1972) 21.00 Dead Birds (Alex Turner, 2004) 22.50 One Damned Day at Dawn (Demofilo Fidani, 1970) 0.30 Joy Division (Reg Traviss, 2006) 2.35 You Pay Your Money (Maclean Rogers, 1957) Horror Channel 11.10 Child of Darkness, Child of Light (Marina Sargenti, 1991) 15.50 Stephen King's The Langoliers (Tom Holland, 1995) 21.00 Mischief Night (Richard Schenkman, 2013) 22.45 Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde (Roy Ward Baker, 1971) 0.40 Haunted (Scooter Downey, 2012) 2.15 Paperhouse (Bernard Rose, 1988) Tuesday 7 July Liberal Arts (2012) Sky Movies Premiere, 6.15pm This film – the second by writer-director-star Josh Radnor, leading man of How I Met Your Mother – is sunny on the surface, but has an undertow of restlessness and doubt. Radnor stars as Jesse, a book-mad 35-year-old graduate who returns to his alma mater and strikes up a rapport with Elizabeth Olsen’s Zibby, a 19-year-old student. It’s an enjoyable meditation on literature and learning. The Key (1958) TCM, 6.25pm William Holden, a young Sophia Loren and Trevor Howard star in this exciting Second World War drama. Canadian tug boat captain David Ross (Holden) meets Stella (Loren), a young woman with a penchant for falling in love with men just like him, only for them to die while on missions to salvage damaged ships. When the key to her flat comes into his possession – once held by all her doomed former lovers – he worries it’s an omen. Arbitrage (2012) Film4, 9.00pm A sleek thriller set in the glittering world of high finance, dripping with flavour and topped with a mesmerising performance from Richard Gere as a silvery hedge fund magnate at the heart of a storm. Gere slides through the film as smoothly as butter on hot copper, and with the same supreme confidence that made American Gigolo so sleazily compelling. Christine (1983) Sky Movies Greats, 12.25am Adapted from a Stephen King novel of the same name, this John Carpenter film, which was scripted, filmed and released within a year of the novel’s publication, tells the twisted love story of a nerdy teenager and his obsessively jealous bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury car. It’s a ridiculous premise but contains just enough shivers to keep thrill-seekers satisfied. Sisters (1973) Horror Channel, 12.40am As well as setting him aside as a true auteur, Brian De Palma’s first thriller stands as a homage to Hitchcock, drawing directly on three of the director’s movies (Psycho, Rear Window and Rope). The plot focuses on a model (Margot Kidder) whose Siamese twin is suspected of a brutal murder. The effective use of the split-screen creates a splintered sense of reality and piles on the tension.

Shot in documentary style, it follows Celia Crowson (Patricia Roc) who finds herself working in an aircraft factory. The overly cheerful tone jars with modern notions of war, but it makes for an interesting social document. Highlights include a climactic dance hall scene, filmed using real serving soldiers. The Negotiator (2005) Channel 5, 3.15pm Kevin Spacey and Samuel L Jackson are impressive in this humdrum thriller. The film follows police negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson), who takes fellow officers hostage while trying to prove his innocence of accusations of corruption and murder. When a negotiator (Spacey) from another precinct arrives to talk sense into him, the two become involved in an intriguing game of one-upmanship. Kidnapped (1971) Film4, 4.30pm Michael Caine, Trevor Howard and Donald Pleasence star in one of the many film versions of Robert Louis Stevenson’s tale of adventure and intrigue set in 18th-century Scotland. Not that you’d know it though – the screenplay jumps around all over the place and the action never gets out of second gear. Caine does his best as Highland adventurer Alan Breck, who befriends an orphan when he is betrayed by his evil uncle. Spider-Man 3 (2007) 5*, 9.00pm After the cracking Spider-Man 2, this third film in Sam Raimi’s trilogy was a little limp (at least in terms of quality; commercially, it was a winner, breaking the record for worldwide first-day takings). This time, our hero (Tobey Maguire) battles Sandman and Venom (Topher Grace) – and, in a way, himself, because a mysterious organism infects him, making him nastier. Visually great but messy plot-wise. Somewhere (2010) Channel 4, 1.15am An indulgent portrait of a rich and famous yet neglectful father (Stephen Dorff) who finds happiness when he gets to know his daughter (Elle Fanning). It is hard to see this as anything other than wish fulfilment from the film’s director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the rich and famous Francis Ford. A disappointing follow-up effort after the brilliance of her luminous first outing, Lost in Translation.

They begin to suspect they have a traitor in their ranks who is revealing their escape plans to the enemy. William Holden picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of wise-guy Sefton and his acceptance speech was the shortest on record at the time – “Thank you. Thank you.” In a Lonely Place (1950, b/w) Film4, 2.55pm Humphrey Bogart is a volatile scriptwriter who gets talking to a girl in a club. The next morning, she’s found murdered and becomes the prime suspect. A neighbour (Gloria Grahame) supplies him with an alibi, then starts an affair with him – but the more she sees of his violent temper, the more she wonders if he’s the killer. Nicholas Ray’s film is now considered a classic film noir and continues to be grimly gripping. The Bourne Legacy (2012) Film4, 9.00pm Jeremy Renner takes over from Matt Damon in the fourth Bourne film, which amounts to little more than an exciting chase. New agent-on-the-run Aaron Cross (Renner) has inconvenient ambitions to survive when a ruthless Colonel (Ed Norton) decides to terminate the clandestine Operation Outcome. And Cross is happy to help the beautiful doctor (Rachel Weisz) involved in the programme to do the same. Moulin Rouge! (2001) Movie Mix, 9.00pm Baz Luhrmann’s intoxicating and stylish spectacle was the first musical to be nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 10 years. Set in 1899, Montmartre, it follows a young British poet Christian (Ewan McGregor) who becomes love-struck with the city’s famous courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). The exuberant mix of period setting and contemporary pop ensure a vivid assault on the senses. The War of the Roses (1989) Sony Movie Channel, 11.35pm An engaging black comedy starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as a happily married couple whose relationship deteriorates – first into squabbling and eventually into farcical near-warfare. The film is held together by the leads, who maintain the acerbic chemistry that they first displayed in 1984 action-adventure romcom Romancing the Stone.

The powerful sexual tension among Anglican nuns in an isolated valley community in the Himalayas prompts all manner of carnal emotions in Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) and Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron). Magic in the Moonlight (2014) Sky Movies Premiere, 10.00pm Woody Allen heads to the south of France for his 49th film, which is full of charm and looks a million dollars. Set in the Twenties, it follows fraudster magician Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) who is set on taking down a supposed spiritualist (Emma Stone). The writing isn’t sharp enough to make this cat-and-mouse game truly sparkle, but Stone lifts the film above the ordinary Gone Too Far! (2013) Film4, 11.10pm Destiny Ekaragha’s Peckham-set comedy, an adaptation of Bola Agbaje’s Olivier award-winning 2007 play, is only the fourth British film directed by a black woman to be released in cinemas in the UK. Frequently funny and insightful, it’s a sharply observed take on tensions between young Britons of Jamaican and Nigerian descent, but unfortunately plunges deep into cliché. London River (2009) BBC Two, 12.35am Brenda Blethyn and Sotigui Kouyaté, a veteran actor from Burkina Faso, both shine in this moving film about two parents searching for their children who they fear have been killed in the London Tube bombings of 2005. They seem an unlikely pair – but then, as their shared loss begins to bring them closer together, the film’s (rather obvious) message is they’re not so different.
