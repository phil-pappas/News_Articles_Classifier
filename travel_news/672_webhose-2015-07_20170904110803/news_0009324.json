And it just got even better. \nIn January, the mobile app debuted a feature that let you instantly translate printed text by simply aiming your smartphone camera at the words. The original version supported seven languages, and now the feature is adding support for 20 more . \nLet's say you're traveling abroad in a country where you don't read or speak the native tongue. If you come across a road sign, just hold your smartphone up so that the image of the sign appears on the display, and let the Google Translate app show you what the words mean in the language of your choice. \nThe feature is now offering support for Bulgarian, Chinese and Ukrainian, among others, and will be available on Android and iOS devices over the next few days. \nThe function doesn't need WiFi or data to work. It'll translate stuff offline via your smartphone camera if you download Google's 2-megabyte language pack for each language you want to use. \nThere's also an option that lets you snap a photo of text and translate it from 37 languages.
