This is separate to packages, and created if all the components are organised separately and invoiced and paid for separately. \nMason said: “In the case of the seriously injured claimant who says I bought a package, and the travel company says: ‘no you didn’t, it was a LTA so you don’t get any compensation’, the judge will be under pressure to say it is a package.” \nNor is this the only confusion being created by the new legislation, Mason said, adding that other areas remained open to interpretation in its current form. \nIn a bid to ensure as many different companies are brought under the legislation as possible, the definition of a package has been widened with clause V of article 3 looking to target OTAs, click-throughs and single-component sellers which covers product “purchased from separate traders through linked online booking processes”. \nGatenby said: “If someone is going to make a claim against you or all three or four of you, you will need to have in your mind who the organiser is.“You’re going to have to think carefully about the arrangements with the suppliers you work with.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T19:22:28.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
