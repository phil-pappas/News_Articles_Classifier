Be inspired by the range of adventurous activity holidays available! You won't regret it and, in fact, once bitten by white water rafting, whale watching or glacier skiing bug (to name just a few of the amazing things you can get to do), holidays will never be the same again. \nIn the World’s Top Ten \nSome of the most beautiful, wild and unspoilt landscapes are to be found in Canada. Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, is justly ranked among the top ten islands of the world. This beautiful island is located on the west coast of Canada and is the largest Pacific island east of New Zealand, boasting a unique and diverse ecosystem. Activity holidays here can be set amidst exhilarating rivers, ancient forests, crystalline waterfalls and pristine beaches. \nThis region is one of the best places in the world to see the magnificent and iconic Orca and Killer Whales. These majestic creatures can be spotted here from July to mid-October. Other whales such as Grey, Minkes and Humpback all migrate here, as well, and this area forms part of their summer feeding grounds. \nThrills and Relaxation \nOne thrilling sport you can take part in here that you will never forget is white water rafting. With professional, experienced guides you will explore part of the most incredible landscape you could ever have the privilege of seeing. Activity holidays in this part of the world offer both spills and serenity in equal measures! As you paddle down the rivers, you will be able to unwind and relax in this exceptionally tranquil setting – but then get set for the ride when you reach the rapids! Your white water rafting experience will give you the true scope of the power of nature, and the sense of achievement when you conquer the rapids will afford a sense of well-being and euphoria that is hard to beat. \nSnow and Spas \nPerhaps what makes Vancouver Island so special is that not only does it offer water sports, and the chance to spot whales and other incredible wildlife, there is also all year round snow on Blackcomb Mountain. This means you'll also be able to enjoy a host of active winter sports surrounded by magnificent mountain scenery. For a gentler pastime, take in a day at a spa, with spectacular views – after all, who says activity holidays have to be all about strenuous exercise? \nCanada is one of the places everyone should see at least once in a lifetime and will leave you feeling both energised and relaxed.   \nRichard Edwards is the Managing Director of Summit & Blue, an adventure holiday company offering independently crafted activity holidays to exciting destinations around the world, including France, Italy, Portugal, the USA and Canada. With unique itineraries and exciting activities like biking, hiking, white water rafting and canoeing, we create holidays for those looking for an experience a little more off the beaten track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:28:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
