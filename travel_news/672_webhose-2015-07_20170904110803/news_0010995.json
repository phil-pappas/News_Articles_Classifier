They will be amazed with how different Terminal 1 is today,” he said.\nPassenger movement areas in Terminal 1 now has new and color-coordinated carpets, repainted ceilings and LED lights, making the airport appear cleaner and brighter. Meanwhile, the often mocked restrooms now don new fixtures and are regularly cleaned.\n“All of the air handling units and chillers at Terminal 1 have been replaced with new ones, such that passengers now complain of freezing,” Basanta said.\nTerminal 1 also now uses new flight display monitors. There were also additional check-in, immigration and customs counters set up in order to lessen passenger queuing time.\n“The improvement is very significant because passenger queuing is not long as it used to be,” Basanta added.\nThe contractor for the P1.3-billion rehabilitation project, D.M. Consunji Inc. (DMCI), has also installed buckling restraint braces to augment Terminal 1’s protection against seismic movements.\nDMCI is supposed to finish the rehabilitation works last January, in time for the country’s hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. However, completion was delayed due to additional repair works and the terminal management’s delay in turning over the site.\n“Terminal 1 has been operating while the rehabilitation works are ongoing. It is really a challenge to complete the rehabilitation in time because there are areas of the terminal that could not be turned over to the contractor right away,” Basanta explained.\nThe airport official said DMCI is supposed to finish the structural retrofitting of Terminal 1 by July 3 but as of press time, the contractor is requesting for an 82-day extension to fix the basement, ramp and other non-passenger movement areas. Basanta said DMCI’s request is still being evaluated by the Department of Transportation and Communications and the Manila International Airport Authority.\nFollowing the relocation of five international carriers from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3, Basanta said they have maintained NAIA Terminal 1’s rated capacity of 6.5 million passengers. This annual passenger volume translates to an average of 7,300 arriving passengers and 8,000 departing passengers daily.\n“We used to have 8 million annual passenger volume and we used to accommodate 11,000 to 12,000 passengers daily,” Basanta said, illustrating government’s decongestion efforts.\nAs of press time, Terminal 1 houses the operation of 25 foreign air carriers. Basanta said Terminal 1 will welcome its 26th airline—Ethiopian Airlines—by July 9.\nSince its construction in 1979 and consequent operation in 1981, NAIA Terminal 1 only had a makeover in 1995, because of the Philippines’ hosting of the APEC summit in 1996. Designed by the late national artist Leandro Locsin, the NAIA Terminal 1 is originally designed to accommodate only 4 million passengers annually.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-07-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T23:10:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
