This makes the sophisticated technology accessible and affordable to even the smallest short line that needs inspection services. Chicago, Illinois (PRWEB) July 10, 2015\nSasser Family Holdings subsidiary NxGen Rail Services is pleased to announce that Amtrak has certified NxGen's state of the art track inspection car for operation on the back of their trains. Amtrak trains can now be used to provide easy access to the company’s NxTrack high-speed rail inspection cars for clients nationwide. NxTrack is a revolutionary rail inspection system technology that travels at line speed to carry out a comprehensive real time health check of the track. NxTrack can also identify most Federal Railroad Authority defined defect types, including geometry, rail and joint bar breaks, missing fasteners, missing bolts, anchors, damaged ties, damaged switches and degraded subgrade.\n“NxTrack provides safer rail lines for everyone by quickly and accurately pinpointing areas of disrepair along miles of track,” said Robert Grant, Managing Director of NxGen. “Thanks to Amtrak, we can now easily transport the car to customers at a fixed low cost in a known timeframe. This makes the sophisticated technology accessible and affordable to even the smallest short line that needs inspection services.”\nNxTrack was launched last year as the first system of its kind, integrating multiple inspection technologies which were once employed singularly. The NxTrack car collects real-time data and gives customers a 360-degree view of the full rail infrastructure, integrity and track geometry by combining full geometry, optical, and ground penetrating radar (GPR) sensors. The on-board, proprietary analysis and management software interprets the track condition using Federal Railroad Authority-based rules. Integrated machine intelligence analyzes the probable root cause of problems so engineers can make better maintenance decisions.\nNxTrack has already secured the safety of countless miles of track across North America and is delivered as a full-service operation or under long or short-term lease to the customers.\nAbout NxGen and Sasser Family Holdings, Inc.: NxGen Rail Services is an integrated rail technology solutions engineering and development company operating in North America.
