It had about 50 properties on its books. \nA message on its website originally read: “It is with great sadness due to unforeseen circumstances, the company has now ceased to trade and the directors have instructed Sharma & Co to assist with a view to placing the company into creditors’ voluntary liquidation.” \nHowever, it has now been updated and reads: “International Villas has ceased trading and is working on a rescue package. A further update will be provided before close of business on Thursday 30th July.” \n“If you have any queries regarding the company, please contact Hilary Gumbs at Sharma & Co on 0044 121 454 2700 or Hilary@sharmaandco.com.” \nWhile the liquidators work on a rescue package for the company, concerns are arising that British holidaymakers are being impacted by the problems. \nThe Daily Mail has reported that already three families from the UK arrived at the island on Saturday with nowhere to stay. \nRoberto San Esteban, president of Ibiza-based holiday lets’ association Avat, told the newspaper: “The problems started to occur at the weekend and we’re predicting many more to come. \n“My understanding is five rentals groups including three which were British contacted members to try to find a solution after finding they had nowhere to stay when they arrived on Saturday for what they thought was going to be a dream holiday. \n“It’s the height of the tourist season and solutions as far as I know were only found in two of the cases. \n“Members have also taken calls from groups that are due to arrive next weekend and are looking for a last-minute alternative. \n“Some of the homeowners that co-operate with us say they’ve only received 30% of their full payment or a week instead of two and they’re not prepared to let holidaymakers in unless they receive what they’re owed. \n“We’re helping out where we can. But in cases where International Villas were managing a property on an exclusive basis it’s impossible sometimes to track down the homeowner so we can attempt to reach a solution.” \n“Speaking personally and not as president of Avat, I have to say I find it curious that the firm has gone into voluntary liquidation at one of the busiest holiday times of the year when customers have paid a fortune and many homeowners are yet to receive their full money.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:03:30.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
