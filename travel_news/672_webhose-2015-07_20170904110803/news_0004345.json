Food and drink have become a critical focus for most travellers,” shared WFTA Executive Director Erik Wolf. “There is a lot that businesses and destinations everywhere can be doing to leverage food and drink as tools for economic development. Food and drink should be the foundation of all tourism development.”\nWTM London, Senior Exhibition Director, Simon Press agreed, commenting: “WTM has focused on food tourism in the past, but never to this degree. Interest in food tourism keeps increasing every year making it an ever-important topic for the travel industry.”\nAt the event, Erik Wolf will deliver two sessions. Session one will be Food & Drink Travel: The Hidden Harvest, an entertaining and engaging classic that introduces the food tourism industry and its benefits, as well as the demographics and psychographics of food travellers. Hint: food travellers are not necessarily who you think they are!\nIn Session two, delegates will hear about New Trends in Food & Drink Travel. The formal food tourism industry was founded in 2003, and a lot has changed since then. Consumer interest in food and drink is at an all-time high. Attendees will learn how to leverage those trends for a business or destination. Wolf will share these insights and more.\nSource:- Reed Exhibitions\nRelated Posts Egypt’s tour guides’ new business: Producing opium Ryanair, TUI and Flybe Bosses to Debate The Future of Flying Chelsea Football Club Hosts Leaders Sport Summit 2013, the world’s most Prestigious Sport Business Summit TripAdvisor touches mark of 100 million downloads for free app for iPhone and Android ‘Earn While you Learn’ Programme – India", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:03:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
