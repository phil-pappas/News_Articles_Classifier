To that end, the airline will work with Air Logistics Group (ALG) as its General Sales and Service Agent for Brussels Airlines Cargo. The collaboration marks a new era in which Brussels Airlines wishes to get even closer to the customer, also now in its freight activity.\nBrussels Airlines Cargo has in recent years become an increasingly important activity within the airline. From its home base Brussels Airport, Brussels Airlines transported over 41,000 tons of cargo in 2014 between Europe and Africa, between Europe and the United States and within Europe. Thanks to a close cooperation with other partner airlines the entire world is connected to the Brussels Airlines destinations.\nFreight volumes have been increasing year over year: in the last 5 years Brussels Airlines Cargo has seen double digit growth as it has added additional capacity. In 2014, cargo traffic increased by 34 percent on North Atlantic routes and a revenue growth of 8 percent was achieved on African routes. Brussels Airlines Cargo’s strengths include a unique African offering, with high flight frequencies, reliability and unique products including the ‘Fresh-to-shelf’ formula for perishable goods from Africa.\n“Brussels Airlines Cargo is more than ever a strategic revenue contributor of our business and we foresee a further growth of our tonnage by 6 percent in 2016”, says Brussels Airlines VP Sales Africa & Cargo Philippe Saeys-Desmedt.\nTo enable this growth, Brussels Airlines Cargo has taken the strategic decision to partner with Air Logistics Group (ALG), who will represent Brussels Airlines Cargo worldwide with effect from September 1st. The freight capacity out of Africa will continue to be commercialized by Brussels Airlines.\nSource:-Brussels Airlines\nRelated Posts Antalya Gazipasa Airport opens new terminal building Austrian Airlines Financial Results as at 30 September 2013: Positive result gives optimism for break-even in 2013 BOC Aviation Marks 20th Year With Record Net Profit in 2013 Lufthansa Group increases result in core business Virgin airline named top u.s. airline in conde nast traveler’s 2013 readers’ choice awards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:03:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
