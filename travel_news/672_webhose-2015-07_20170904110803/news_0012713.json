Witnesses near Lewisfield Plantation reported hearing what sounded like an explosion before the Cessna went down and crashed into a watery rice field while the jet veered eastward. Photos taken by onlookers of the F-16 Fighting Falcon wreckage showed “55” and a pair of dice painted on the metal. The 55th Fighter Squadron is part of the 20th Fighter Wing, which operates at Shaw Air Force Base near Sumter. A spokesman for the base would not immediately confirm that a jet from there had been involved in the collision. The S.C. Air National Guard reported that none of its planes are believed to be involved in the accident. The Cessna was reported to be down near Lewisfield Plantation near Moncks Corner, where there are reports of parts on a roadway. The plantation is on the upper Cooper River and near Lake Moultrie and U.S. Highway 52. Another possible crash site is the nearby Mulberry Plantation. Wayne Ware, who lives on McCrae Drive just south of Lewisfield Plantation, was going for a walk when he heard the collision. “I didn’t see it; I heard it,” Ware said. “I turned around, and I saw the jet. Pieces started falling out of the sky. His engine is lying right there at the campground.” First-responders reported seeing a “debris field” from the F-16 near Medway Plantation, which is south of the other locations. Emergency personnel were told not to touch any of the parts, whether in the woods or the water, according to radio communications. Responders also were told to stay upwind of the F-16 crash site because of the potential for exposure to hydrazine, a toxic fuel used by the aircraft. Michael Mule, spokesman for Berkeley County, said emergency responders had set up an incident command post at the Big Lots shopping plaza at 1013 Old Highway 52.
