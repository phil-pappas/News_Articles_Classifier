Those staying in Kensington will be within walking distance of one of the world's biggest and most impressive libraries – the British Museum. With volumes dating back to the 16th century, its collection is so vast it's mind boggling. \nIf, while you're staying in Kensington, you want to avail yourself of the resources of this incredible library (or any other in central London), you may want to understand a little more about the system. \nFrequently asked questions \nIf I am staying in Kensington in one of the hotels, will I be able to borrow a book from a library? \nMost of London's public libraries will require you to join before allowing you to remove books under loan. There may be the possibility of temporary membership but even that may be an issue if your place of normal residence and your forms of identity all relate to addresses outside the UK. So, on balance, it may be difficult for you to borrow from a public library. \nThe same might apply when trying to borrow books from the academic disciplines of the British Museum or other libraries. Some may not lend books at all, while others may only allow them to be removed by students and staff. \nDepending upon your area of interest, you may find that some private library collections may allow visitors to remove books under certain specific and demanding conditions, such as the payment of a substantial deposit. \nDo I need anything special to use the reference libraries? \nIn the case of public libraries, usually not. Most reference library sections can be used by the public. In the case of many academic libraries and almost certainly all private libraries, you may need to make a prior appointment. Remember that some libraries within both of these categories may not admit you at all unless you meet certain criteria. \nAre any fees involved in using reference libraries? \nNo, not if they are public institutions. Many academic libraries will also probably be free even if an appointment is required. The practices adopted by private libraries may vary tremendously, but many will require the payment of a fee. \nCan I take photocopies of materials I have found in reference libraries? \nThis is a tricky one as it depends a lot upon whether or not the material concerned is considered to be under copyright. It is advisable to be extremely cautious about taking copies or photographing materials unless you have sought the librarian’s prior permission. \nWill my hotel be able to source a book in a library for me? \nIf you're staying in Kensington in one of the better hotels, you may find that they have membership to a local library or the British Museum and might be able to source a book for you on request. \nRegardless of whether or not you'll be permitted to borrow a book from the libraries at the British Museum, it is well worth setting aside some time on your itinerary to spend simply soaking up the ambience of this incredible cultural centre.
