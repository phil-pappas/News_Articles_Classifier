For the very keenest bookworms, money is no object. But would you, if you could, buy the most expensive first edition in the world? Peter Harrington owner Pom Harrington (Brian Smith) If the answer is yes, then this might just be your golden opportunity. Peter Harrington , the bookseller specialising in rare books, with shops on London’s Dover Street, in Mayfair, and Fulham Road, has launched a new 50-strong catalogue of ultra-rare books. Not only are they as rare as my favourite steak at Hawksmoor, but they are also just a little bit over your usual budget. The price of some of these books would get you a sizeable family home. For some book-buyers, collectors and otherwise literary dreams, these copies will hit the spot. They must be the greatest books in the world, you might cry, seeing the price tags, but actually, they are. The catalogue includes a first edition of Rumour at Nightfall by Graham Greene, which retails at £45,000. It has been described by Peter Harrington owner Pom Harrington as “one of the great rarities in the Greene canon”, making it a must-have for early 20th-century literary fans. The 20th century author Graham Greene (Corbis) A glorious 30s classic comes in the form of Winner Take Nothing, by Ernest Hemingway, with an affectionate inscription inside to his second wife. This Hemingway first edition is on the market for an eye-watering £42,500 but is the perfect addition to a Hemingway fan’s collection. Another rare first edition is the first volume of Karl Marx’s Das Kapital, of which only 1,000 copies were ever printed; now, its going rate is £77,500.

James Joyce, Ulysses: £250,000 This is one of just 100 copies on Dutch handmade paper, and signed by the author. It is owned by novelist and editor Annie Winifred Ellerman, known as Bryher, who gave financial support to writers including James Joyce and Edith Sitwell, and counted Gertrude Stein and Hemingway among her circle of friends. Bryher was a companion to the poet Hilda Doolittle, known as HD. She befriended Joyce in Paris in 1921 and helped finance the publication of Ulysses. James Joyce, the author of Ulysses (Rex) Thomas More, Utopia: £350,000 A first edition of More’s Utopia, which tells the best order of society on the island of Utopia. Asking if the ideal society is attainable, it sees protagonist, the Portugese traveller Raphael Hythlodaye venture on journeys to the New World. First published in Latin around about the end of 1516, the book introduced the idea of “utopia” to literature, inspiring works as diverse as Gulliver’s Travels and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. A glimpse into Utopia (Peter Harrington) William Shakespeare, Comedies, Histories and Tragedies: £325,000 A delicious third folio edition of Shakespeare’s play, this is generally regarded as the rarest of the 17th century folio editions. An unknown number of copies are thought to have been destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666, making this one a real treasure. The American financier and collector John Pierpoint Morgan was once the owner of this copy, and it was bought by him from London booksellers Henry Sotheran & Co in the summer of 1896.
