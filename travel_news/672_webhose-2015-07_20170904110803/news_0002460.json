Television commercials were aired on CNN, CNN Headline News, and CNN Airport, as well as CNN.com, with the aim of persuading more American tourists to visit this African country. \nDuring a past tour to the US, Mr. Kikwete picked the famous American businessman and photographer, Mr. Douglas Pitts, as Tanzania’s Goodwill Tourism Ambassador to America. Taking advantage of the eighth Sullivan Summit held in Tanzania's northern city of Arusha in 2008, Mr. Kikwete campaigned to woo Americans of African origin, urging them to come to Africa to visit their ancestral lands on the continent. \nIn his keynote address to over 4,000 delegates of the summit, he spoke perfectly as a senior tourist campaigner for his country, telling the African Diaspora in the United States to come back and visit their lands of origin. \n\"Please come and visit Africa and invest in this vast, rich, and tourist attractive continent. Tanzania assures you of a good return of your capital and protection,\" he told the delegates, most of them from North America. \nHe said Africa needs foreign investments in tourism and the African Diaspora in the US were in the best position to take advantage of their ancestral continent in order to invest. Turning into an authoritative tourist campaigner, President Kikwete said Africa has little shares in global tourist gains despite the continent's rich attractions made up of wildlife, attractive geological features, and history. \nAmong key, global tourism events of which he participated and addressed including the 33rd Africa Travel Association (ATA) Congress held Tanzania’s northern tourist city of Arusha in May, 2008 and which Mr. Kikwete was the chief guest. \nSpeaking to some 300 ATA Congress delegates, Mr. Kikwete said Africa was lacking behind in global tourism shares because of poor resources shared among each country. He said Africa’s share in global tourist business is small despite that the continent has been blessed with abundant natural tourist attractions. \nAfrica expects to receive about 77 million tourists in 2020, but the number is too small compared to its abundant and unbeatable attractions, the president told the 33 ATA Congress delegates. \nComparatively, Africa lacks behind compared to the global share of 1 billion and 1.6 billion tourists during the same period, he added. \nAfrica had as well, remained behind in tourism development because of poor resources and underdeveloped infrastructure, which for decades, and hampered traveling within and outside the continent. \nHe said Africa badly needed developed infrastructure and accessibility to global travel markets, mostly the American and European market outlets. \nAir connection in Africa has been a permanent setback in tourism development among the countries. “Traveling from one African nation to another is difficult that one may have to go to Europe in order to get air connection to another country located within the boundaries of the continent,” Mr. Kikwete noted to the 33rd ATA Congress delegates. \nThe outgoing Tanzanian president as well, opened and addressed 250-plus delegates of the 5th International African Diaspora Heritage Trail Conference (ADHT) held in Tanzanian capital city of Dar es Salaam late in 2010. \nSpeaking to ADHT delegates, Mr. Kikwete encouraged Americans of African origin to visit this continent to see the rich cultures Africa has been endowed with, also wildlife resources. \nOther, remarkable tourist functions which he had addressed and worked out tourism development plans including conferences and field trips to mark 50 years of the discovery of the skull of oldest man at Olduvai Gorge in Ngorongoro, northern Tanzania way back in 2009. \nMr. Kikwete participated at the global event which celebrated the 50 years of the milestone discovery of the skull of the oldest man in the world that was made by Africa’s famous archaeologists, Dr. Louis Leakey and his wife Mary, in the excavation area of Olduvai inside Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA). \nThe president ordered authorities to construct an international class museum to preserve the oldest human footprints plus exhibition rooms for archaeological finding as to attract more tourists to Tanzania and Africa. \nOfficiating the opening of the first edition of Swahili International Tourism Expo (S!TE) late last year, Mr. Kikwete waived away the fear sweeping among foreign tourists over the spread of Ebola pandemic in Africa, saying the continent was safe, while governments were full united to fight the outbreak. \nHe decried over negative publicity of the African continent, saying this continent is worth a visit. \nDespite ups and downs in Tanzanian politics, Mr. Kikwete remains the friendliest leader of Tanzania, and the man who has led 45 million people without grudges or suppression to any person. \nA section of residents in Tanzania’s capital of Dar es Salaam and who monitored the outgoing President’s speech through local television stations told eTN that the outgoing head of state had led this African nation with a human face. \n“He is more humanitarian than a politician. He never oppressed anyone, even his political opponents. He treated his political foes equally to others and loved even those who opposed his leadership straightly”, a city resident told eTN. \nMr. Kikwete said he was happy to leave his top post and the people at peace and Tanzania as a united country, which is now heading to general elections for new president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T18:01:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
