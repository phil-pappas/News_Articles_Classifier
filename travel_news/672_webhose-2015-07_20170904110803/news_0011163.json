(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) By KEN SWEET The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks were mixed in early trading Friday, as investors reacted to some disappointing quarterly earnings. Declines were led by energy companies after two big oil companies reported a slump in earnings. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,735 as of 10:24 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose two points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,111 and the Nasdaq composite was up 14 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,143. \nBIG OIL HUMBLED: Shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest publicly energy companies, fell almost 5 percent each in early trading. Both companies reported their results Friday, posting major declines in profits largely due to the big drop in the price of oil over the past year. Exxon said its earnings fell 52 percent, missing estimates. Chevron reported a profit of 30 cents a share, well below the $1.13 analysts expected. \nBOTTLED UP: Coca-Cola Enterprises, an independent bottling company of Coca-Cola products, jumped $4.87, or 11 percent, to $50.36 after The Wall Street Journal reported that Coca-Cola Enterprises is in merger talks with its European counterparts.
