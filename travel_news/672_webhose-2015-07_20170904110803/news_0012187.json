It’s just a guy with a backpack, right? Well, there’s actually more to this than first meets the eye.\nBecause this could in fact end one of the biggest travel frustrations — the endless battle of having so many places to see, but so few clean clothes left.\nYep, this isn’t just your ordinary backpack, it’s actually a washing machine. Really.\nThe Scrubba Wash Pack claims to be able to clean your clothes wherever you are — using no electricity and minimal water, and relying on hundreds of nodules inside that form an “internal washboard”.\nYou can wear it as a backpack, and fold it up to fit you pocket when you’re finished.\nThere are hundreds of nodules inside. Source: Supplied\nAussie inventor and frequent traveller Ash Newland recently showed it off on Shark Tank Australia , and is aiming to make it available for purchase in September if all goes well with his crowd funding bid on Indiegogo .\nNewland first launched a portable washing machine in 2012 — the Scrubba Wash Bag — but quickly realised it had limitations.\n“The best travel product is one that is multifunctional,” said Newland, who has a PhD in Medical Research and Biotechnology from Adelaide University. “People love our Scrubba Wash Bag but we realised that unless it is also used as a dry bag or laundry bag it often just sits in a backpack or suitcase between washes.\n“So we invented the Scrubba Wash Pack — the world’s most functional day pack.”\nIt’s very portable. Source: Supplied\n“Most travellers pack a day pack already, why not pack a lightweight one that is versatile, weatherproof and can wash your clothes.”\nThe idea of a portable washing “machine” first struck him while he was climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and needing to minimise space in his backpack. That coupled with the often exorbitant prices of laundromats, made him sure there was a better way.\nThe invention. Source: Supplied\nSo how does it actually work?\n1. Put your dirty clothes in.\n2. Add water up to the marker on the outside of the bag (around three litres) and a small amount (a few drops) of washing liquid (or even body wash if you’re travelling).\n3. Roll and seal the bag’s opening.\nYep, the clothes go in. Then they come out clean, apparently. Source: Supplied\n4. Let any additional air out through the little valve.\n5. Lay the bag on a flat surface and rub the top of it with your hand for anywhere between 30 seconds and three minutes — depending on how dirty your clothes are.\n6. Undo the top of the bag and pour the dirty water out.\n7. Put in 3L of freshwater and rub bag again to rinse.\n8. Pour out water, hang your clothes to dry and turn the bag inside out so it can dry.\nThat’s it, apparently!\nWashing machine bag\nHow effective is it? We hope to find out soon!
