Technology companies have offered so-called bug bounties, but they are unusual in the transportation industry. \nUnited spokesman Luke Punzenberger said that two people have received the maximum award of 1 million miles each and others got smaller awards. A million miles is enough for several first-class trips from the US to Asia or up to 20 round-trips in the US. \nPunzenberger declined to say what kinds of flaws the hackers found but said their information had been turned over to company researchers. \"We're confident that our systems are secure,\" he said. \nUnited has suffered several major problems with technology systems since 2012, when it switched passenger-reservations and other systems over to those that had been used at its smaller merger partner, Continental Airlines. \nLast week, all United flights were briefly grounded and more than 1000 delayed after one such breakdown, which the airline blamed on a faulty computer router. A smaller outage occurred in June. \nAirlines \"take all necessary precautions\" to keep customer data secure, and most if not all have internal programs that continuously check systems for intrusions, said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for the industry trade group Airlines for America. She said, however, that the group isn't aware of any other airline offering a bug bounty. \nBounties are common in the tech world. Companies use them to enlist so-called white-hat hackers with enough specialised skill to spot security gaps before cybercriminals use them to steal customer information or crash websites. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and others publish bounty rules on their sites. \nFacebook, for example, asks hackers for \"reasonable time\" before going public with their findings. It promises not to sue or call law enforcement on tipsters if they do their best to avoid privacy violations and service interruptions during their research.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T04:19:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
