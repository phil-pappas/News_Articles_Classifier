This event marks the 30 th country where the company's high-touch, one-on-one services for patients and families are available to aid companies conducting clinical trials increase trial enrollment and improve patient retention, thus helping to ensure that costly studies complete on time and on budget. \"Since its inception two years ago, Clincierge has supported multiple studies internationally for pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations with great success and overwhelming positive feedback from patients, research site personnel and sponsors,\" said Scott Gray , Clincierge chief executive officer. \"By offering patients and their families personalized services in their own language from their own in-country coordinator, and providing patients ease-of-access to research sites, studies using Clincierge have seen increased enrollment and have maintained drop-out rates of less than 5%. Moreover, the cost of incorporating Clincierge services has averaged less than 1% to overall clinical trial costs.\"\nOffering personalized support to trial participants and their families alleviates anxieties about trial-related travel, expenses and other issues that can get in the way of patients enrolling and staying in a clinical study. \"The ultimate goal of Clincierge is to aid drug developers in reducing overall clinical testing time and cost by making clinical trials more patient-centric, thus helping ensure that new treatments get to the market and to patients who need them as swiftly as possible,\" Mr. Gray concluded.\nThe Clincierge Model \nClincierge represents an innovative new model for moving clinical trials toward patient-centricity. The company's services -- including individualized travel and housing logistics, rapid user-friendly payment/reimbursement systems, and ongoing personalized, in-country patient and caregiver support -- reduce the anxiety and out-of-pocket expenses faced by trial participants and their families. From the time a patient enrolls in a Clincierge-supported study until study completion, the company's multi-lingual, in-country Clincierges provide seamless support by coordinating, managing and communicating with patients and their families and caregivers each step of the way. Clincierge addresses special patient needs and complex trial designs by building custom solutions to specific study-related problems. The company currently supports trials in 30 countries and 23 languages, adding new service areas and capabilities as its clients need them. \nClincierge also helps trial sponsors, CROs and research institutions manage cost and time through a proprietary business management platform. Not only designed to increase patient participation and retention in clinical studies, the Clincierge platform allows for transparent, customizable financial reporting and analysis. Trial site and sponsor staff are similarly benefitted by Clincierge's services, which relieve Clinical Research Associates, Investigators, Study Managers and other site personnel from time-consuming patient logistics -- thus, enabling them to focus on patient care, study administration and data management.\nClincierge leverages more than 20 years of travel and hospitality experience of its parent company, Gray Consulting International, a specialist in pharmaceutical and life sciences meetings, events and people logistics. Gray's global resources and expertise enable Clincierge clients to take advantage of a more than $500 million travel spend for transportation and accommodations on behalf of its customers and a seamless process of getting patients to and from clinical trial sites.\nFor more information on Clincierge and how our services help patients better access and remain in clinical trials, while potentially lowering the time and cost of those studies, please visit our website at http://www.clincierge.com or contact us at +1-215-413-7880.\nAbout Gray Consulting International\nGray Consulting International (Gray) is a provider of corporate project management and logistical services with four business divisions:  Clincierge, International Meetings & Incentives, Gray Travel Services and GForce Promotional Products.
