All dishes are prepared at the live-cooking station and create a warm and welcoming atmosphere in which to enjoy these home cooked delights. Igino Bruni has a precise vision for L’UNICO at Kameha Grand Zurich: “My guests should feel like they are holidaying in Italy. The aroma of the home-cooked pasta and its fresh preparation at the live-cooking station create an atmosphere reminiscent of sitting at the kitchen table of an Italian mamma,” says Bruni. Igino Bruni, who hails from San Leone in Italy, loves the cuisine of his native country. “I put my heart and soul into my cooking,” he says.

Bruni brings to Kameha and L’UNICO 18 years of gastronomic experience including Chef de Partie in the Seven Group in Ascona, La Brezza in Ascona, the Carlton in St. Moritz and the Kulm Hotel in Arosa. However, Bruni considers the highlight of his career to be his time as Sous Chef in the Seehof-Stübli in Davos, which led to his 17 Gault Millau points and Michelin star. L’UNICO also offers an outstanding Brunch, which will take place on Sundays from 11am-3pm and is priced at CHF 69/£48 per person.
