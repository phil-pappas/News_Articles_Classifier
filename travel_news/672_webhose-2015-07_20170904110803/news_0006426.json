Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 09, 2015 Emirates Boeing B777-200LR Adv: \nEmirates has just launched another flight from Dubai to Seattle, adding a second frequency on the route, operated by, what else, a Seattle built Boeing B777-200LR. \nAs the primary service continues to be operated by a larger Boeing B777-300ER, both flights are nonstop, will the capacity increase be some 75 percent, until demand allows for the deployment of the larger version of the B777. Emirates does operate the largest fleet of this aircraft type in the world. \nPassengers from the airline’s Eastern Africa destinations of Entebbe, Nairobi and Dar es Salaam will now be able to choose from two flights if they are heading to US West Coast. \nMeanwhile, come October, Entebbe will see the current Airbus A330-200 be phased out and the larger and arguably more comfortable Boeing B777-200LR be used on the route, also constituting a notable increase in passenger and cargo capacity out of Uganda’s main aviation hub. \nDar es Salaam is served double daily with Boeing B777 aircraft too. Nairobi, also served twice a day out of Dubai, has also seen a change from the previously used Airbus A340 to the larger Boeing B777.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T21:21:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
