A subsequent report by Marsh shows only 18pc of UK businesses understand cyber risks. These five tips may help you to be more secure... Educate your team “The easiest way to communicate security awareness is to make it relevant to your team's own lives,” says Vikas Bhatia, CEO of SME security specialists Kalki Consulting. “You need to educate yourself, your family and your entire staff with security dos and don'ts. We try to educate clients by showing them it is not just a technical problem but a company-wide issue that can be open to exploitation at any level of the organisation. Individuals often grossly underestimate their contribution to the cyber security problem and how their information can be exploited for financially-motivated crimes.” Always back up “Keeping back-ups is one of the most important things,” says Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of security firm High-Tech Bridge. “It means you can quickly restore data in case of a loss due to cyber attack. But don't forget to secure your back-ups. Many companies become victims to data theft because they forget to protect their back-ups.” Monitor USB sticks Stephen Wares, cyber risk practice leader (Europe, Middle East and Africa) for Marsh, believes all removable media has the potential to cause a breakdown in security and should e be monitored closely. “USB devices are capable of holding significant amounts of data,” he says. “By providing employees with the ability to plug this type of device in, the organisation must also recognise the potential for critical data leakage, as well as the potential for malicious code to be introduced to the network.” Work together You may have the best security systems and pay dearly for it, but you also have to consider the actions of your clients, professionals you hire and outside agencies. Communication between yourself, those in your sector and even police or government departments is essential for the larger security picture. “Hackers target human weakness as much as technology weaknesses,” says Wares. “Providing convenience over security is often a rich source of vulnerability that highly successful hackers use.” It doesn't have to cost a fortune Vikas Bhatia suggests that small businesses give themselves a cyber health check once a month, using sites such as the government's cyberstreetwise.com to keep ahead of the game. “Remember that most technologies you can use have an auto-update service to keep you safe,” he says. “But do be aware that security is always a work in progress. Signing up to an alert service is always advisable. These are usually free and will keep you abreast of any major problems out there.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office • Five of the best bookkeeping apps for SMEs • Top tips for SMEs on keeping overheads low • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T19:39:14.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
