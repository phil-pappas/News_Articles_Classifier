The thoughtfully designed restaurant, which will feature a 2,500 square foot interior with seating for 50, will open in the heart of Toronto's Dundas Square (10 Dundas Street), near Tim Hortons. \nBlaze Pizza is a modern day \"pizza joint\" that has been inspiring excitement and cultivating fanatics for its custom-built artisanal pizzas, freshly made salads, blood orange lemonade and s'more pies since it opened its first location in Irvine, California in 2012. Each restaurant features an interactive open-kitchen format that allows guests to customize one of the menu's signature pizzas or create their own, choosing from a wide selection of carefully sourced ingredients -- all for a very affordable price. The generously-sized personal pizzas are then sent to a blazing hot open-flame oven -- the centerpiece of the restaurant -- where dedicated pizzasmiths ensure that the thin-crust pies are fast-fire'd and ready to eat in just 180 seconds. The Dundas Square restaurant will use Canadian flour to make its own dough from scratch with a recipe developed by critically-acclaimed Executive Chef Bradford Kent (the \"Pizza Whisperer\"), which requires a 24-hour fermentation period to produce his signature light-as-air, crisp crust. For pizza fans with specific dietary needs, the restaurant will offer gluten-free dough and vegan cheese. The restaurant will also feature a selection of wine and craft beer. \nTo create the perfect vibe inside the restaurant, award-winning design architect Ana Henton has added several localized elements, including an oversized wall graphic featuring the Toronto skyline, which will be custom-built to suit the space. Additionally, in support of the company's commitment to \"Intelligent Choices for Our Pizzas, People & Planet,\" the restaurant will use both recycled and sustainable materials and energy-efficient LED lighting, and will feature eco-friendly and compostable packaging. \n\"We're thrilled to be bringing Blaze Pizza to Canada, and couldn't ask for a better place to begin than the food-forward city of Toronto\" said Jim Mizes, president & COO of Blaze Pizza. \"At Blaze, we're all about carefully sourcing ingredients, cooking by fire, and letting guests enjoy high-quality artisanal pizza at crazy fast speed. We think that the authenticity of our food, plus our service culture that genuinely focuses on the happiness of our guests and crew, will be key to our success in Canada.\" \nBlaze Pizza is looking forward to building strong roots within the community, offering a spot where guests can connect, create and enjoy. To that end, the restaurant will promote a turn-key fundraiser program that returns 20% of event proceeds back to local organizations, helping schools, sports clubs and other local groups \"cause a scene for a good cause.\" \nAbout Blaze Pizza The first Blaze Pizza ® restaurant opened on Aug. 6, 2012, in Irvine, Calif., and quickly gained attention for its chef-driven recipes, thoughtful interior design, and a service culture that celebrates individuality.
