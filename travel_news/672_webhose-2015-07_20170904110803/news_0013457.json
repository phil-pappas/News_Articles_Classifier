The little-known history of the landmark dates back to 1930 when Alessio Carraro came to Arizona and completed his project of developing a resort and housing subdivision just east of Phoenix. The cake-like structure that is seen now was part of Carraro's hotel. It became the home of Edward Ambrose Tovrea and his wife Della, whom Carraro sold the property to only two years after finishing the project. The castle is open for tours Friday through Sunday in the mornings, and prices range from $10 to $15. Visit tovreacastletours.com .\nView a slideshow of a recent First Friday in downtown Phoenix.

Soleri and his students began building Cosanti using experimental architecture and designs that reflect a philosophy of living resourcefully, frugally, and anti-materialistically. The buildings, which serve as studios, were built using imaginative architecture that integrates the structures with the earth. Walking through Cosanti puts the visitors in a completely different kind of society that Soleri and his staff envisioned and realized with Cosanti.
