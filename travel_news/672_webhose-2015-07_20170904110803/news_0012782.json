This is my interpretation of a dish documented by William Pokhlebkin, one of my favourite food writers - the Alan Davidson of Soviet food writing. Even though his books adhere to a dry technical style dictated by the state at the time, his love and admiration for the vast mvariety of Soviet cuisines manages to shine through and infect with gastronomic wunderlust. SERVES 2 INGREDIENTS ¼ tsp fenugreek seeds 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 tsp fennel seeds 3 tbsp sunflower oil 1 small onion, sliced 1 x 400g can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed 1 tsp sherry vinegar ½ tsp brown sugar ½ bunch fresh coriander, chopped 2 sprigs parsley, chopped 2 sprigs dill, chopped METHOD Heat a small, dry frying pan and toast the fenugreek, coriander and fennel seeds until fragrant, then crush with a pinch of sea salt using a pestle and mortar. Heat 2 tbsp of the sunflower oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and cook over a medium heat, stirring from time to time, for 10 to 15 minutes until they are amber and sweet-smelling. Add the beans and warm them through. Mix together the remaining oil, vinegar, sugar, crushed spices, herbs and some seasoning in a bowl. Stir this through the warm beans and serve. This is equally beautiful served warm or cold.
