Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Jul 13, 2015 Adv: \nWhile Tanzania’s famous northern circuit national parks, Mt. Kilimanjaro, the Selous Game Reserve, and of course Zanzibar, comprising of the islands of Unguja and Pemba, are well known abroad and need little explanation, this more distant location has always been a specialty destination for tourists. \nThose who ever made their way, by air or by boat, to Mafia Island, have tall tales to tell. Excellent diving grounds along the reefs surrounding the island, rewarding snorkeling trips, endless empty beaches with no beach boy pests bothering the visitors, good fishing, and an intact nature rarely found today, make up some of the attractions tourists enjoy and come back for. Ruins of ancient settlements dating back to the 11th century give an insight into the history of Mafia, which, while at one time part of the Kilwa Sultanate, changed hands multiple times among major seafaring powers that ruled the world at one time or another. \nLocated about a hundred miles south of Dar es Salaam and only a few miles off the mainland, almost opposite the Rufiji River delta, the small archipelago of Mafia is one of Tanzania’s best-kept secrets. Some 50 kilometers long and at the widest point just 15 kilometers across, the island is almost entirely surrounded by a massive barrier reef teeming with marine life, and half of the island’s shoreline extends into a marine national park. While an airstrip allows for daily flights to the mainland and telecommunications allow to stay in touch with the rest of the world, a trip to Mafia is also a trip back into time, and as such, a marvel waiting to be explored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:18:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
