Australian and international scientists, researchers, government officials, defence force personnel, academics and business leaders in industries as diverse as aeromedical, chronic disease, medical education and training, defence, mining, local government, telecommunications, building and construction will convene in the tropical harbour city to conduct conferences, seminars and business meetings. \nAs the closest Australian convention centre to South East Asia with approximately 4 hours flight time to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Ho Chi Minh City, there are a growing number of Australian and Australasian associations choosing Darwin as their preferred conference destination, to attract both Australian and South-East Asian delegates. In the forthcoming months, the Darwin Convention Centre will be the host venue for the Aeromedical Society of Australasia and Flight Nurses Association for their 27th Conference. This is the leading Australasian event for the aeromedical association attracting delegates from throughout Australia and Asia. This will be followed by the 7th Annual NT Resources Week from 25 – 27 August, which sees the South East Asia Australia Offshore and Onshore Conference run along the Mining the Territory and Building the Territory Conference. This dedicated week brings together leading personal in petroleum, mining, exploration, engineering, construction and gas to meet and discuss the latest development within Northern Australian and South East Asia. The first class facilities, warm and friendly service, tropical weather and stunning backdrop of the Darwin Convention Centre are also very compelling reasons for organisations to choose Darwin. These attributes help foster a special environment that promotes innovative thinking, business leadership, social engagement and authentic connections. Darwin Convention Centre will also be the venue for Fenestration Australia 2015 Conference from 16 – 18 September, which is hosted by Australian Window Association, Australian Institute of Surface Finishes and Skylight Industry Association.

For the 2015-16 conference season, Darwin has formally extended its warm hospitality by introducing the ‘Darwin Welcomes Delegates’ program. This exciting program aims to showcase local businesses as knowledgeable and friendly hosts to visiting delegates ensuring a memorable visit to Darwin. It is a joint initiative of the Darwin Convention Centre, Northern Territory Convention Bureau and Tourism Top End. On arrival in Darwin, delegates will receive a special ‘Darwin Welcomes Delegates’ card enabling them to enjoy a range of privileges and special offers available at a range of shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions, where the ‘Darwin Welcomes Delegates’ symbol is displayed.
