We opened five hotels in the first half of the year and we expect to open a further 45 over the next 24 months. \n“We have already exchanged contracts for more new rooms in the first half of 2015 than we did in the whole of 2014. \n“Boosted by our strong trading performance and the attractions of the value segment, major developers and financial institutions are showing their confidence in the future of new Travelodge.” \n“Britain continues to be a nation of value seekers and the value hotel market continues to be the fastest growing part of the UK hotel industry. \n“New Travelodge is well positioned and we expect our strong trading momentum to continue into the second half of the year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T05:37:52.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
