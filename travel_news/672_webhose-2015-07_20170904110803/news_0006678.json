The answer, so far, seems to have involved some of the UK's leading politicians chasing rodents around the room in the middle of official meetings. Is there a better way? Can Larry be trained to hunt mice with more dedication and enthusiasm? Cats are either born hunters or lazy layabouts There are many theories but little proof that anything works to change a cat's hunting ability. I've heard it said that cats can be transformed from sofa-sleepyheads to bloodthirsty feline felons by feeding them raw meat , but I've yet to see any evidence for this. Perhaps training might help, with a life-like mouse toy to encourage him, but I'm sceptical. Cats are either born hunters or not. A research team in Texas recently analysed cat hunting behaviour : they found that 44 per cent of cats hunted, catching an average of two prey items per week, with more in the summer, and less in the winter. â€¢ Cats may have nine lives but mice don't, owners told I have three cats, and just one, Spin, is a hunter. When he's allowed out at night, it's often like a battlefield on our kitchen floor the following morning. Bloodied mouse carcases are lined up side by side with the severed heads of small garden birds. There's nothing pleasant about it: it's a challenge to get the evidence cleaned up before my wife and daughters come down for breakfast. They adore Spin and I don't want that to change. Anti-pounce collars - ungainly but effective I've tried to stop Spin from his bloodthirsty endeavours. I once kitted him out with a CatBib , proven to reduce cat hunting behaviour. This is a soft neoprene bib that attaches to the cat's collar and hangs loosely over the cat's chest. It works by interfering with the precise timing and coordination that a cat needs for successful prey catching. An independent scientific study showed that it stopped 81 per cent of cats from catching birds and 45 per cent of cats from catching mammals. CatBibs may look awkward and ungainly , but studies have shown that most cats (86 per cent) adjusted almost immediately to wearing a CatBib, 10 per cent took a day or so and only 4 per cent took longer. 44 per cent of cats hunted, catching an average of two prey items per week, with more in the summer Pete Wedderburn The CatBib successfully stopped Spin's mouse and bird killing, but just for a few days. Within a week, I found him contentedly grooming himself at the cat flap, a dead mouse at his feet, and no CatBib in sight. I fitted a new one, but this time, it was gone within a day. Either Spin worked out how to remove it himself, or a cat-friendly neighbour took pity on him. Cat collar bells - the traditional answer - are now thought to make cats even better hunters, training them to move even slower and more silently in their efforts to avoid making the bell tinkle. A modern alternative , with a motion-sensitive flashing light and electric beeper, works well sometimes, but has mixed reviews. Old age and poor health: the ultimate cure for a hunting cat Spin recently stopped hunting, and at the same time, I noticed him breathing heavily. I brought him to our resident cat vet , who found that he had developed cardiomyopathy . He's now on three tablets twice daily to keep him healthy. There's only one unfortunate side effect from his treatment: his hunting has resumed, with more early morning kitchen floor bloodiness to clean up. Spin's days are now numbered: there is no long term cure for cardiomyopathy. The mice and birds of our garden won't thank me, but I've decided just to let him enjoy the time that's left to him: no more CatBibs or beeping collars for our Spin.
