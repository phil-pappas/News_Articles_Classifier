I land in the Periyar Bus stand by 5am, sometimes later at 6am. That's fine as I just pull on my back pack and hang my hand bag around my neck and strap my food bag across my chest. My look funny but I don't really care as I needed it all for the days I was in the campus. Autorickshaw drivers come up to the door and block my path going down. I cant handle it the harassment of these guys as they are a very uncomfortable ride and plus their demands for the fare is ridiculous. You are at their mercy which I never like to be so I get down and push my way past them and walk towards the Periyar bus stand. The bus stand is packed with lots of buses, all going everywhere possible across the city. And the stand is getting crowded. Lots of women had begun to set up stray shops selling fruit and fragrant jasmine. The tamil women wear thick braids of the flower in their hair every single day. I resist the urge to buy a strand as I am already weighed down with luggage. I walk around asking people bus to the University? And they calm me saying it is coming, don't worry! I decide enough of asking everyone around and just go up to a conductor or two who point to the bus. You see the buses are numbered and named in Tamil a script I don't read at all. Even the numbers are different from Hindi which I am familiar with. Finally with a sigh of relief I climb into the bus and take a whole seat with my bags. It was good to put them down and flex my shoulders and rest my legs. I keep a change purse in my bag from which I take out a Rs 10 note. I know from prior experience I will have to pay Rs 9 for the ticket to the University and I have to hold it carefully -- the ticket. I now know where the University stop is. But everyone from the driver to the conductor and other travelers say University on the tops of their voices and eager hands help me with the bags. The tamils are a gentle and helpful race I have found on all my trips. Women are very safe, and many one can see cycling all over hitching up their pavadas ( long skirts) or sarees. The University campus main gate arrives and I get off. I take a minute or two to adjust my bags and scan the road to be able to cross it. A vast expanse of road so I have to be very careful. It's good to walk through the gates into the sleeping 500 acre campus but I am happy to reach the Faculty guest house after a 2km walk. I can already picture putting on my little travelling kettle for that welcome cup of tea. I feel safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T21:41:11.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
