With resorts this large, it takes many months to create the magical settings travelers and locals alike look forward to as part of their holiday traditions.”\n“Despite the simmering heat outside, we’ve ordered more than 8 million pounds of ice blocks to create ICE!—our popular frozen attraction that is kept at nine degrees Fahrenheit,” Stengel said. “Master ice artisans from Harbin, China are already preparing to carve the colorful ice sculptures and multi-story ice slides at each resort.”\nICE Carver at Gaylord HotelAt The Frostbite Factory inside ICE!, visitors will be able to see the craftsmanship of the ice carvers in action. Select locations will also include On the Blocks—an exclusive ice bar for guests ages 21 and older.\nICE! at Gaylord HotelsICE! is presented by Pepsi and themes for 2015 include Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town at Gaylord National; Christmas Around The World at Gaylord Texan; The Nutcracker at Gaylord Opryland; and ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas at Gaylord Palms.\nVisitors to the resorts will also enjoy The Elf on the Shelf® Scavenger Hunt, an interactive journey throughout the hotels. By finding all of the scout elves hiding in the resort and solving the puzzles in the scavenger hunt booklet, families will help Santa’s scout elves fulfill their special Christmas mission.\nThe array of holiday entertainment at Gaylord Hotels includes something for every member of the family, ranging from enchanting live shows and thrills like snow tubing and ice skating to visits with Santa, holiday kids’ trains, character breakfasts and even a Gingerbread Decorating Corner sponsored by PEEPS® .\nDetailed information on each location’s holiday packages and events may be found at:\n- Gaylord National Resort (National Harbor, Maryland)\n- Gaylord Opryland Resort (Nashville, Tennessee)\n- Gaylord Palms Resort (Kissimmee, Florida)\n- Gaylord Texan Resort (Grapevine, Texas)\nRelated Posts Artisans Sculpt 8 Million Pounds of Colorful Ice at Gaylord Hotels Marriott: Christmas Comes Early as Gaylord Hotels’ Holiday Packages Go on Sale Perfect Florida summer vacation with suntastic deals at 30 JW Marriott®, Renaissance®, Marriott® Hotels and Resorts, and Gaylord® Hotels.
