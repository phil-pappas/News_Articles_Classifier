Candles in the wind The riverside community of Ladchado, Ayutthaya Province, will be celebrating the annual Candle Festival along the river on July 30, as its residents prepare for the arrival of the Buddhist Lent. Like many things in Ladchado, the candle festival is celebrated on the water with hundreds of small sampans decorated with flowers and colourful parasols bobbing in the water as they emerge from the far side of canal. Tucked away in Phak Hai district, Ladchado is about 40 kilometres west of downtown Ayutthaya. How does your garden grow? Pullman Khao Lak Katiliya Resort and Villas is going even greener with its newly launched vegetable garden, which will ensure guests only eat the healthiest ingredients when dining at this 5-star resort. The resort has dedicated an impressive 500 square metres of its grounds to the herb and vegetable garden, which produces more than 14 different species of plants for its kitchen. The addition of the garden also reduces the hotel's carbon footprint by decreasing the demand for motorised deliveries from Phuket International Airport to the resort. A great place for a holiday Bangkok tops the list of Asian cities most searched for as a global summer holiday destination by Indians, according to global travel site Skyscanner. Although London was the top searched destination overall, Bangkok came in at number two globally, ahead of other favourite destinations New York, Dubai, Paris and Toronto. According to the Skyscanner report, tourists from India to Bangkok are growing at 119 per cent per year. Thailand as a whole is well-known among Indian travellers for its ancient sites, value-for-money shopping, tasty Thai food, lively nightlife, and beautiful beaches. Double the flights, double the fun Thai AirAsia X is to increase its flights between Bangkok Don Mueang (DMK) and Seoul Incheon (ICN) from one to two a day from October 25. The airline launched its first Bangkok-Seoul flight in June last year, and enjoys an average load factor of 83 per cent. \"There is great potential for this route to continually grow and in order to meet this demand, we are now launching a second daily flight so passengers will have more options and flexibility to choose their travel time,\" noted Nadda Buranasiri, the airline's chief executive. Seoul and Bangkok are popular destinations for both Thai and Korean travellers. More than 200,000 Thais visited South Korea from January to May, while about 550,000 Koreans made it to Thailand in the same period. 311 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T03:12:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
