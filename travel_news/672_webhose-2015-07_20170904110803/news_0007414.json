The report, titled, \" Global Luxury Goods Market - Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast, 2014 - 2020 , \" pegs the market to report a modest 3.4% CAGR through its six-year forecast period. While the market was valued at US$296.1 billion in 2013, it is forecast to stand at US$ 374.85 billion by the end of 2020. The market is segmented into the following regions for the purpose of the study: North America , Europe , Asia Pacific and Rest of the World. In 2013, Europe was the largest luxury goods market, trailed by North America . The former's leading position can be credited to its massive travel retail network and profusion of duty-free shops. While the penetration of luxury brands is high in the developed countries within incidence, the same cannot be said of emerging nations in regions such as Asia Pacific or the Rest of the World (RoW).

In Europe , consumers are seen to be largely spending on premium as well as affordable luxury goods. The scenario in emerging countries is unique in that consumers here have both the awareness and the means to purchase luxury goods, but face a dearth of outlets and channels through which they can realize this want. Browse the Press Release of this report, here: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/luxury-goods-market.htm The report notes that the global luxury goods market's growth will be restricted by the following: Uncertain economic scenarios, currency devaluation, and a shortage of highly-trained and knowledgeable frontline store executives. With the cultural leanings of consumers in various emerging countries being different from those in the developed countries, luxury brands are also faced with the challenge of tailoring their market offerings to suit the needs the newly-affluent consumers. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T16:52:12.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
