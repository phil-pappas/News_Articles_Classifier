The bar, enormously comfortable beds and continually burning log fires also help. From £160 per person for dinner, bed and breakfast. There are just three rooms at The Spoons , a chic B&B built by its owners, Ian and Marie Lewis, near Skeabost Bridge. Each has soothingly chic décor, luxe fabrics and is equipped with top-end tech (hello, Nespresso machine). From £145 for two people. • More Skye hotels Stay and cook at the Kinoch Lodge Eat If you want to visit the famous Three Chimneys in Dunvegan, be sure to book ahead. Word has got out about this remote gem, and rightly so: not only does this restaurant have rooms and a Michelin star, its new chef Scott Davies sources from local farmers, crofters and fishermen. Book the cookery workshop at Kinloch Lodge with head chef Marcello Tully and you’ll get a taste of what it takes to run and work in an award-winning restaurant – and a fascinatingly hi-tech one at that. Lunch (which you’ll have helped make) in the grand dining room is included. From £99 • More destinations on Skye for foodies Fine dine at The Three Chimneys Drink Stop for some local ale at the Old Inn & Waterfront Bunkhouse , a low-key pub with a glorious terrace on glassy Loch Harport. Plan your trip around a visit to the Edinbane Inn on a Wednesday evening or Sunday afternoon to hear traditional music performed by locals (including the owners). Do Hike the Cuillin, the island’s mountain range. An easy – but hugely rewarding – route takes you up Coire Làgan to a mountaintop loch. Find the start at Glenbrittle campsite.

From £54 (weather permitting) Sleep tight at the Spoons Buy Whisky fans will be in heaven at the Talisker Distillery in Carbost, where you can take a tour and pick up a single malt. Take home a Hebridean, Icelandic or Norse sheepskin from Skyeskyns tannery in Waternish – or order online if you don’t have room in your luggage.
