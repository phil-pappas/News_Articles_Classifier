This is an exciting development and as we roll out by source market there will be a lot of learnings. But we see it very, very positively, building a global brand is absolutely the right thing for us to do and we’re very committed to it.” \nLong confirmed that the Thomson name would eventually go but that the fate of First Choice had yet to be sealed. \n“We haven’t made a decision yet in terms of First Choice but we did in respect of Thomson,” he said. \nThomson (then owned by Tui) and First Choice came together in a merger in 2007. \nIn 2011, Tui Travel, as it was then known, announced it would be rebranding all its stores as “Thomson featuring First Choice”. \nLong had served as chief executive of First Choice prior to the merger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:00:35.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
