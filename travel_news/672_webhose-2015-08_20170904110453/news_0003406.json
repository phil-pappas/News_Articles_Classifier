He said black ice or falling icicles can also force the dome’s closure in winter. \nThe Reichstag building attracts 2.5 million visitors a year. Admission is free, but visitors must register in advance. — Reuters More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:26:17.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
