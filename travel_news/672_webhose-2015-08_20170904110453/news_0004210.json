When the plane entered air that, instead of simply sitting there, was flowing slightly upward or slightly downward, the plane’s path was altered slightly upward or slightly downward.\nAir pockets do not technically exist, yet it’s an expression that has caught on and is still misused today. Really, what you’re experiencing is turbulence.\nSo what happens when you experience a bumpy ride that rattles glasses and turns some knuckles white? The first thing you need to understand is a basic rule of flying: the Earth has different surface temperatures that impacts flight as the aircraft passes through.\nFor example, the surface of a lake is cooler than the surrounding earth, or ploughed fields have a different surface temperature than those that are unploughed. Warm air is lighter than cool air. Warmed air rises. Cooled air descends. When a plane encounters varying airflow, we can feel what we call an “air pocket” today.\nThe idea of an “air pocket” might seem reassuring from a pilot’s point of view, for a pocket is something you slip your hand into. When you do, your hand can only go so far. But, over the years, the phrase has come to be thought of as an area where there is no air.\nWith no air, what is going to hold the plane up?\nThe plane won’t simply go out of control. Source: Getty Images\nThe term, if misunderstood, can lead to fear that an “air pocket” — a place devoid of air — could be big enough to cause a plane to plunge to the ground or go out of control. But it doesn’t exist.\nIt may be helpful to try to imagine a “water pocket,” an area in a lake where there is no water. You can’t, right? Since you can see water, it is hard to conceive of such a thing as a water pocket.\nOne analogy that is helpful to some people is picturing the sky as one large bowl of jelly. Imagine that large bowl of chilled jelly with a small, plastic aeroplane in the middle. Now, pick up the bowl and shake it. The aeroplane certainly moves and jiggles, but it is impossible for the small plastic toy to fall out of the bowl (the sky).\nFlying through an “air pocket” isn’t much different from driving your car over a pothole or steering a boat over waves. It may be bumpy, but you’re rarely in danger — that is unless you’re not wearing a seat belt.\nCaptain Tom Bunn, retired airline pilot and licensed therapist, is the founder of SOAR , a program designed to help those with fear of flying and flight-related anxieties.
