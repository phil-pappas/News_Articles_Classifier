On Saturday, one KLM plane made a particularly wobbly landing in high winds - but the pilot kept their cool to land it safely. The plane is clearly being rocked by the wind and is buffeted from side to side as it approaches the runway. The plane withstands some pretty serious weather on the way down But the pilot brings the wheels down and manages to land smoothly on the tarmac at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. It looks hair-raising from the ground, so imagine how terrifying it must have been for the passengers on the plane. The plane banks to an alarming angle before it touches down The Netherlands has been hit by storms which have killed one person. Fortunately this pilot's skill meant that none of his passengers became victims of the bad weather.
