(NYSE: DAL) has banned the shipment of big-game trophies worldwide on its flights. “Effective immediately, Delta will officially ban shipment of all lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies worldwide as freight,” Delta said. “ Prior to this ban, Delta’s strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species. Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments.” Wayne Pacelle , president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States released a statement to applaud Delta. “Lions, elephants and the other species that make up the Africa Big Five belong on the savanna, not on the walls and in home museums of wealthy people who spend a fortune to kill the grandest, most majestic animals in the world. Delta has set a great example, and no airline should provide a get-away vehicle for the theft of Africa’s wildlife by these killers.” Lufthansa and Emirates Airline have similar polices banning the shipment of big-game trophies, the organization noted. \nWant Atlanta Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:01:29.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
