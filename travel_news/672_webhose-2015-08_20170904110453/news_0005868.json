Soon after his arrival, the place became a major settling point of the Portuguese. They built a large fort in 16th century to stop the invading Mughal armies, who had their sway over the lands before the arrival of Portuguese. Even today, the fort stands with most part of it preserved in the original form. Thus, making it one of the best preserved monuments in India. The fort today houses chief government offices and is a must-visit for every traveller who is in the city. \n\nAmongst the most popular sightseeing spots here include: Jampore Beach, Church of Bom Jesus, Pargola Garden, Paryatan Bhavan, Mirasol Water Park, Devka Beach, Kadaiya Lake Garden, Moti Daman, Somnath Mahadev Temple, House of Bockage, Jetty Garden, Collector Office, Chapel of Our Lady of Rosary, Daman Ganga Tourist Complex, St. Paul's Church, Nani Daman, and the small villages around the city. \nSource: Free Articles from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nDimpy Roy, a travel blogger, writes about best luxury hotels in Daman for frequent travelers.
