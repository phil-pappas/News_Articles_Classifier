It’s always been a region with a slightly wilder character than the rest of the country. It’s where Australia is often at its most Australian, from the timeless tropics of the Top End to the desert expanse of the Red Centre. A trip here serves up vast ochre landscapes, croc-filled billabongs and millennia-old rock art. It’s a land of raw nature, big dreams and rugged views. Don’t think of it, however, as lacking in home comforts. Far from it. As well as serving up an extraordinary spread of national parks, outback road trips and laid-back towns and cities, this is also a fantastic place to relax, eat and drink. Just look at palm-fringed capital city Darwin, somewhere far smaller than the big East Coast metropolises yet brimming with great cafés, restaurants and markets. It’s been blessed with a hugely multicultural population, something especially evident at the city’s famous twice-weekly Mindil Beach Market. Here, among the music and craft stalls, you’ll find everything from Indonesian and Thai to Greek and Italian dishes, all best accompanied by a glass of something ice-cold and a melting beach sunset. In the recently restyled Waterfront District, gleaming new Mod-Oz restaurants, mezze lounges and oyster bars share the billing with craft-beer pubs, artisan ice-cream parlours and barramundi- and-chips stalls. Fresh kangaroo skewers and bush-spiced duck confit never tasted so good If you’d rather take in the view from the water, harbour dinner cruises are offered too: expect local prawns, barbecued steaks and excellent wines. The Northern Territory is big on personality, both in terms of the characters you’ll meet and the spectacular settings, which are always a big part of the overall magic. Take as examples high-end wilderness retreats such as Cicada Lodge and Bamurru Plains, set near Katherine Gorge and Kakadu National Park respectively. Fresh kangaroo skewers and bush-spiced duck confit never tasted so good. Further south, in the fabled outback town of Alice Springs, dining is no less special. Opt for à la carte spots such as Tali and Red Ochre Grill (famous for using native ingredients like pepper berries, wattleseed and lemon myrtle) or delve into Alice’s quirky café and bar culture with a meal at Page 27 or the retro-themed Monte’s Lounge. Or, to make the most of the great outdoors, chef Bob Taylor can take you out to nearby Simpsons Gap for stargazing and a traditional camp-oven dinner. No summary of the Northern Territory’s unique food and drink experience would be complete without focusing on the majestic natural wonders at the country’s heart. Kata Tjuta, Kings Canyon and the formidably beautiful Uluru provide awe-inspiring mealtime backdrops, whether you’re enjoying fine dining under a million outback stars at Tali Wiru or indulging in beautifully prepared local produce and superb wines at Longitude 131. The Northern Territory’s culinary scene is unforgettable, inimitable and unmistakably Australian. Go and taste it for yourself.
