None of the prison's more than 1,200 employees have been sickened.\n\"The staff at San Quentin showed exemplary preparedness to this incident and we continue to be flexible in our responses as we control this situation,\" Correctional Lt. Samuel Robinson said in an email.\nThe disease is considered a severe type of pneumonia, bringing high fever, chills and a cough.\n\"As we have people come down with symptoms we're going to test them,\" said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the federal court-appointed receiver who controls inmate medical care.\nA recent outbreak that sickened 128 people and killed 12 in New York City was traced by the city's health commissioner to a rooftop air conditioning unit at a Bronx hotel.\nLegionella bacteria grow in water and spread through water molecules, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacteria can cause a mild infection known as Pontiac fever or the more serious infection known as Legionnaires' disease.\nThe disease occurs when contaminated water is inhaled into the lungs in the form of steam, mist or moisture. It is considered particularly dangerous for older people and those with underlying health issues.\nOnce officials identify the source, they generally use higher-than-normal levels of chlorine to kill the bacteria. Water at the prison usually comes from a tank that can hold about 3 million gallons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T11:16:38.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
