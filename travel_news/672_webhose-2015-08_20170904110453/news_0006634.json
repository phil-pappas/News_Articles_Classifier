A passenger was shocked by what he found on a Ryanair plan Source: Flickr \nA PASSENGER has told of his disgusting mile-high experience with budget airline Ryanair, where he was forced to sit next to a bag of vomit. \nNoel O’Hare had boarded a flight from Gatwick to Dublin on Monday when he noticed a mess near his seat — and an overwhelming smell. \nA pool of vomit had not been cleaned up from a previous flight. \nSo, as every discerning traveller would do, the 24-year-old took to Twitter to share his horror along with a photo of a bag of vomit and tissues. @Ryanair boarded flight FR113, looking forward to next 1.5hrs looking at vomit, was told will NOT be cleaned #filth pic.twitter.com/W4FItJlVPs — Noel (@noelohare) August 16, 2015 \nWhen alerted to the “unsightly mess”, staff informed Mr O’Hare than it couldn’t be cleaned until they landed. \n“Yesterday I was on a flight home from Gatwick to Dublin and there was vomit in the row next to me, it had happened on a previous flight,” Mr O’Hare told the Irish Mirror . \n“Cabin crew made no attempt to clean it and told me it would not be cleaned until Dublin. \n“I had to sit next to vomit for an hour-and-a-half, the plane was warm, the sick smelled and it made me heave.” \nHe said the experience was simply “disgusting”. \nRyanair replied to Mr O’Hare, saying: “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will forward this onto our in-flight team to investigate this further and hopefully limit this going forward. Apologies for any inconvenience caused.” \nIn a later statement, the airline said: “We sincerely regret this incident which was caused by a shortage of cleaners at Gatwick Airport, which would have delayed the return flight by more than one hour.” \nIt’s not the first time passenger have been left disappointed at planes not being cleaned properly. @noelohare @Ryanair not as bad as your experience but it's seems quite a common thing for planes not to be cleaned. pic.twitter.com/CH0I8ALoqV \nAnd if you think that’s gross, last month a passenger was shamed after allegedly letting her son urinate in an airsickness bag in his seat , with urine “splashing everywhere”.
