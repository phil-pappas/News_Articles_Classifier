Industry sectors expected to benefit from the planned infrastructure developments include oil and gas (O&G), mining, agriculture, and retail. \nNew analysis from Frost & Sullivan, African Infrastructure Tracker: Kenya, reveals that Kenya is set to become a hub for intra-regional trade in Africa. An estimated $55.6 billion in investment into infrastructure development for Kenya is planned (as of 2015), the majority of which will focus on telecommunications and power generation infrastructure. \n\"Transport infrastructure has undergone major upgrades over the past 5 years in order to support the high trade demand in the East African region,\" said Frost & Sullivan Senior Economic Consultant Craig Parker. \"The Nairobi Southern bypass, for example, was commissioned in 2012 and is already 40% complete.\" \nMajor road projects that are currently underway were established to alleviate the severe bottlenecks and traffic congestion. An estimated $5.14 billion has been dedicated to road project investment in Kenya. \nHowever, disputes and illegal occupation of land in areas where infrastructure projects are underway, or are about to take place, have resulted in high relocation costs. This will culminate in delays along with escalating project completion costs. \nFurthermore, legislative changes to the tendering process in Kenya have placed limitations on the type of projects international firms can get involved in. In order to address these challenges, and be accepted for infrastructure project tenders, global firms will be required to form local partnerships or joint ventures with domestic firms. \n\"Although private participation in infrastructure development is growing and tender processes are becoming more transparent, forging local partnerships will remain crucial for entering the Kenyan market successfully,\" reiterated Parker. \"This explains the emergence of high priority public-private partnership programmes, which boost the prospects of local construction companies and financial institutions that can offer finance to companies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:42:07.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
