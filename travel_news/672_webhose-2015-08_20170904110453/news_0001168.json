Just like Colonel Sanders, who traveled over 200,000 miles a year to visit every KFC® restaurant across America, these loyal KFC fans took an epic journey of their own. And, to honor them, KFC treated the two families to a first-class, behind-the-scenes visit at their headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky where the Original Recipe® magic continues today. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

After hearing the news of their courageous pilgrimage, KFC invited them back for a behind-the-scenes tour of the brand's headquarters in Louisville, to actually prepare their beloved fried chicken alongside KFC's head chef and see how the Original Recipe® Kentucky Fried Chicken is made. Lutfy and Janna, along with their families, were treated to a day at the KFC headquarters, where they experienced the capital of fried chicken firsthand. They took \"statue selfies\" with the famous Colonel Sanders statue in KFC headquarters' lobby; visited the Colonel Sanders museum and sat at the very desk where the Colonel himself sat in his prime; met head KFC Chef Bob Das, who invited them to dine with him at the Chef's Table and enjoy freshly-prepared Original Recipe® Chicken. They even tasted new products and got a VIP look at the vault that housed Colonel Sanders' world-famous, top-secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:30:27.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
