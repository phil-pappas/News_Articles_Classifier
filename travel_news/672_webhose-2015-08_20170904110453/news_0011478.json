Recognized as one of the foremost global experts in the field of airline revenue management and optimization, Dr. Belobaba is Principal Research Scientist at MIT's International Center for Air Transportation and Director of the University's Global Airline Program. Dr. Belobaba will advise on matters of network composition and management, serving in this capacity alongside MIT Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart and fellow MIT Global Airline Research Engineer William Swelbar. He will also support OneJet's Director of Engineering, Dr. Barry Smith, former Chief Scientist of Sabre, the world's largest airline technology company. \nCommenting on his colleague's appointment, Mr. Swelbar stated: \"OneJet is engaging the tremendous challenges, and therein opportunities, created by the unprecedented structural changes currently taking place within the U.S. air transportation system. Peter's appointment not only reflects the scale of the opportunity at hand but also a razor focus to engage our industry's very best in order to maximize the reach and effectiveness of the OneJet network in improving service options within the lower volume air markets which collectively constitute roughly half of our nation's air transportation traffic.\" \nDr. Belobaba stated: \"The OneJet program represents the opportunity to combine mass scale distribution and on demand based optimization science to create highly efficient, scalable networks which can sustainably provide easily accessible and relatively low cost nonstop travel solutions for businesses and consumers. I'm thrilled to join my MIT colleagues, as well as the rest of OneJet team, as we deploy these networks over the coming several years to serve U.S. travelers. This innovative platform represents a huge opportunity for the U.S. regional transportation industry and the constituents it serves.\" \nRecently, OneJet announced a multi-phase expansion schedule, following the successful piloting of the program between April and July of this year. The Company will add up to twelve destination and/or focus cities through 2016 in parallel with a structured fleet expansion. Today's announcement follows last week's appointment of former U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Ray Lahood, to the OneJet team. Both gentlemen complement an existing base of transportation leadership, including former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation, John Porcari, Virgin America founding CEO and former Delta President, Fred Reid, and former Kayak Chairman, Terry Jones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:22:37.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
