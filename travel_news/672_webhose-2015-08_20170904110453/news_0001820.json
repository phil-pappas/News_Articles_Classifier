Around 78% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings so far and while profits have generally beat estimates, revenue has fallen short of forecasts. \n\"The bar has been set pretty low and part of that is obviously because of the strong dollar and because of weak oil,\" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in a call. \"We continue to see that problem and it's likely going to impact the third quarter as well.\" \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nPriceline jumped more than 5% after soaring past quarterly estimates. The online travel agency earned $12.45 a share, 47 cents above estimates. Revenue fell short, however, with sales of $1.28 billion down 40% from a year earlier and coming in $990 million shy of expectations. \nFirst Solar added more than 18% and pulled fellow solar stocks SunPower ( SPWR ) and SunEdison ( SUNE ) higher after beating quarterly estimates. The company also exceeded full-year guidance forecasts. \nDisney was a drag on the Dow, falling more than 7% after missing sales estimates in its third quarter. Revenue of $13.1 billion missed expectations by $130 million. Profits were better than expected, though, climbing 11% and exceeding forecasts for the 11th consecutive quarter. \nLumber Liquidators ( LL - Get Report ) plummeted after reporting a 10% decline in comparable-store sales in the second quarter. The company has suffered since controversial reports on the safety of its products earlier this year. Quarterly net losses of 75 cents a share missed expectations by 81 cents and total sales fell 6% to $247.9 million. \nZillow ( Z - Get Report ) jumped 5% after reporting a far narrower net loss and triple-digit sales growth in its second quarter. The online property company reported a 37% increase in real estate revenue and a 44% jump in mortgage revenue. \nDreamworks ( DWA ) shares fell 10% even after the animation studio reported a net loss of 13 cents a share, half the loss analysts expected. Revenue jumped 40% to $170.78 million and beat estimates by just over $4 million. \nTime Warner ( TWX ) earned $1.25 a share in its recent quarter, 22 cents above estimates. Quarterly sales of $7.34 billion increased 8% from a year earlier and beat expectations by $440 million. The entertainment conglomerate saw its strongest growth at Warner Bros., tied to the strong video game releases of Batman: Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X . \nDISH Network ( DISH ) was higher after reporting a better-than-expected quarter despite a drop in pay-TV subscribers. The cable operator earned 70 cents a share, 25 cents above forecasts, on revenue 4% higher to $3.83 billion. The number of pay-TV subscribers fell 81,000, nearly double the loss of a year earlier. \nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil was flat after a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude oil inventories. Crude inventories declined by 4.4 million barrels over the week, more than double an estimated drop of 1.5 million. \nThe U.S. trade deficit increased 7.1% to $43.84 billion in June, tied to a higher volume of auto imports from Europe, according to the Commerce Department on Wednesday. Economists had expected the deficit to climb to $42.8 billion from a revised $40.9 billion in May. \nNon-manufacturing activity in July grew at a faster-than-expected pace, according to the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index. A reading of 60.3 in July climbed from 56 in June and exceeded estimates of 56.2. \nThe private sector added 185,000 jobs in July, according to the ADP Private Jobs report. The reading was well below an expected 210,000 increase over the month. June's report was revised down to 229,000 from 8,000. \nThough its track record has been spotty, the ADP report is used as a litmus test for the labor market ahead of the official monthly jobs report. The July employment situation report from the Labor Department is out this Friday and economists expect nonfarm payrolls to increase 212,000 after a 223,000 jump in June. \nInvestors have been on high alert for signs of weakness in economic data ahead of the next Federal Reserve meeting in September. Economists widely expect the Fed to raise rates at that meeting, which would be the Fed's first money-tightening policy action in nine years. \nWall Street ripped from deep to shallow losses on Tuesday as volatility returned to markets ahead of Friday's jobs report. The session marked the third day in the red, though benchmark indexes' losses were mild.
