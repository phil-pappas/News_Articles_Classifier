Check if this is affecting your journey \nAir traffic controllers were also advised of the incident to ensure flights at Liverpool and Manchester airports avoided any smoke. \nThe tanker caught fire on the hard shoulder of the M56 at junction 14, a few miles from Ellesmere Port. \nThe Manchester to Chester railway line has reopened but the line between Helsby and Hooton remains closed. \nEarlier, stretches of the M56 became gridlocked, with traffic backing up as far as Liverpool, with a knock-on effect into north Wales. \nPhotos posted on Twitter showed motorists leaving their vehicles to sunbathe or play football on the opposite side of the carriageway, which was empty of traffic. Five fire engines have been tackling the fire Cheshire Police tweeted this photo of the burnt-out lorry from their helicopter The tanker caught fire just before 15:00 BST Both sides of the M56 were shut between junctions 12 and 15 \nAre you affected by the fire on the M56?
