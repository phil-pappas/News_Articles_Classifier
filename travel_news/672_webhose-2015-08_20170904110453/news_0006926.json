PowerPost commercial electric vehicle charging stations (EVSEs) are designed and manufactured by Telefonix Inc, a technology design and manufacturing company that creates product solutions for highly regulated industries. \n\"This installation makes a huge statement,\" says Bill Williams, Business Development Manager for Telefonix, EVSE Division. \"The electric vehicle movement is gaining steam and will continue to do so. Facilities like PDX are acknowledging this growing community and sending a signal that they support those who are embracing electric vehicles by installing stations for both airport employees and travelers.\" \nPortland International Airport chose PowerPost level 1 electric vehicle charging stations for their integrated, retractable cord reel, which keeps cables off the ground, reducing maintenance and tripping hazards. They were also selected because they are level 1 units, which have low current requirements and allow for an efficient use of energy. Level 1 charging is well suited for long-dwell parking that is typical at airports and workplaces. The low-current requirements of level 1 also allowed the airport to install more charging stations, compared to more powerful chargers that often require costly upgrades to the electrical supply. Level 1 charging enables EV drivers to recover about 5 miles of range for every hour they are plugged in. The range lost in a typical commute of twenty miles is recovered in about 4 hours at a cost to the facility of less than 75 cents. \n\"We are excited to support our travelers and employees with these new EV charging stations,\" says Vince Granato, Port of Portland chief operations officer. \"Voted America's Best Airport in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in Travel + Leisure's Reader Survey, we take pride in delivering a memorable and positive experience to those who use our facilities. \nThe installation of EV charging stations is one of our many environmental initiatives, which are central to how we do business and serve as good community stewards.\" \n\"Airports are really taking an aggressive approach to delivering on the need for electric vehicle charging infrastructure,\" says Williams. \"Given that customers parking for 4 hours or more represent over 85% of all occupied spaces at an airport and the fact that airports often have sustainability initiatives in place, it's a perfect fit.\" \nThe PowerPost EV charging stations will be free to use for employees and visitors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:31:59.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
