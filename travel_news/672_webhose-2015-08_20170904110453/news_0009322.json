(AP) â€” The first woman in the U.S. to become a railroad engineer is set to be inducted into the North Dakota Railroad Hall of Fame.\nRamona Dockter became the first female engineer in the United States in 1976 when she was 19 years old, according to the North Dakota Railroad Museum .\nIn a ceremony Sunday at the museum, Dockter will be inducted into the state's Hall of Fame, The Bismarck Tribune reported ( http://bit.ly/1J7nYMS ).\nDockter started working as a brakeman when she was 18 years old alongside experienced engineers who encouraged her to advance her career. After six months of on-the-job training and three weeks of classroom instruction, she became an engineer.\n\"Being the first female engineer in the U.S., you definitely had to prove yourself,\" Dockter said. \"I want to say the hardest part was ignoring the naysayers, people who didn't believe in me, or people who didn't want me to do it.\"\nDockter's railroad work was not without its challenges, she said. Without an extensive background, the mechanics of engines and boilers were difficult to understand and the strange hours were hard to adjust to.\nBut she said she remembers her time as an engineer fondly.\n\"I loved the times when you're on the train and it's a beautiful morning or a beautiful evening,\" Dockter said. \"You can just see the rolling countryside and wonderful landscape outside the windows.\"\nIn 1984, she retired because her erratic schedule made it difficult to care for her children.\nShe'll be inducted during a ceremony at 2 p.m. on Sunday at the railroad museum in Mandan.\n\"I think it's an honor to be inducted,\" Dockter said. \"But I think there's a lot of people who helped me along the way, and I wish they could get this award, too.\"\n___\nInformation from: Bismarck Tribune, http://www.bismarcktribune.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1J7nYMS", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T07:27:11.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
