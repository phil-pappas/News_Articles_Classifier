For guests wishing to dine-in, there is also a take-away delivery service available. In the evening, gluten-free cocktails are served on the restaurants magnificent covered terrace. Following the success of Celicioso Madrid, pioneer and owner of Celicioso Restaurants, Santiago Godfrid, decided to expand and introduce gluten-free to Marbella. The inspiration for Celicioso was born out of a desire to create tempting gluten-free food after Godfrid himself was diagnosed with coeliac disease aged 23. The owner is delighted he has been able to break down the barriers preventing sufferers from enjoying their favourite foods. In the spirit of creating gluten-free options for everything, Celicioso’s original baked goods menu will expand to encompass a savoury menu and drinks, including juices and cocktails. Santiago Godfrid commented, “We wanted to increase our offer to satisfy all the requests from our clients and to continue growing and working hard. Our new concept will be called Celicioso – Gluten Free – Bakery, Food & Drinks Marbella”. The opening of Puente Romano Beach Resort & Spa’s ninth restaurant, Celicioso, adds to the wide selection of dining options available as well as ensuring that the resort caters to every preference. The resort has already established itself as a culinary hotspot boasting two restaurants from Michelin starred chef, Dani Garcia and the hotel’s popular global cuisine restaurant, Sea Grill.
