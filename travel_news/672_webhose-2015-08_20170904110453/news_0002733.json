The AP obtained a draft report of a study that the agency has been keeping secret for about four years, perhaps so passengers wouldn't be worrying about stats like these: About 20% of controllers committed serious errors on the job in the year prior to the study, such as bringing planes too close to one another, and about half blamed fatigue About 33% of controllers deemed fatigue a \"high\" or \"extreme\" risk More than 60% say they dozed off or zoned out while driving to or from late-night shifts, those that typically run from 10pm to 6am While controllers averaged 5.8 hours of sleep per night in a work week, the figure dropped to 3.25 before some of the more grueling shifts \"Chronic fatigue may be considered to pose a significant risk to controller alertness, and hence to the safety of the ATC (air traffic control) system,\" says the study. Researchers looked especially closely at those who worked a schedule called the \"rattler\" in which they cram five eight-hour shifts into four 24-hour periods. Others work six days a week for a stretch of several weeks. Controllers tell the AP that such shifts are still in use years after the study was completed. (Not scared of flying yet? Read on .)
