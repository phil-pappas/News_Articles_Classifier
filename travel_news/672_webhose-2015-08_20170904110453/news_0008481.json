Discrimination is systemic in the workplace, and with few decent job opportunities, many turn to prostitution, as reported by news.com.au recently .\n“It’s all about sex,” says high-class escort Josie* in tonight’s Four Corners on ABC. “Sex to survive.”\nLike many transgender women, Josie has excellent qualifications that mean little for her career prospects. The former engineering and business management student from the Philippines recently landed a job at a call centre, one she was more than capable of fulfilling, but it was quickly withdrawn when they realised that she was transgender.\n“Transgender rights are where gay and lesbian rights were 30 years ago,” Four Corners reporter Caro Meldrum-Hanna told news.com.au . “It’s the last taboo. We need to catch the wave, the momentum coming out of the US.”\nAfter Josie’s rejection from the mainstream job market, becoming an escort looked like her best option. The services of trans women are in high demand from heterosexual men, who are willing to pay top rates for girls with a difference. Women with “the extra” can earn between $350 and $600 an hour, or $2000 a night.\nStylist Daniella wants love and a good job, instead she has sex with different men every night.

He’s a man and the pressure of kicking is just really so hard.\n“That’s the life of ladyboys. You need to keep on fighting. We will never surrender.”\nHer friend Divina, who escaped a life of terrible poverty and abuse in the Philippines, suffered in a different way after her clients turned her on to methamphetamine. “Trans women are exposed to a lot of drugs,” said Caro. “Clients offer more money if they take drugs with them. Ice is very big — it’s a sex drive drug and it lowers the pain threshold.”\nDivina was introduced to the high-class escort world by a friend after she was unable to get a job, even as a cleaner. She began using ice at the request of clients, and soon spiralled into a drug-induced psychosis. She is now in court-appointed rehab and has been clean since her arrest in April.\nNora’s father shot her when he found a photo of her dressed as a woman.

I eat the make-up sponge, to make me beautiful inside and out. I eat the ants, I eat the grass. Then I start hallucinating ... I went crazy. I felt that a spirit came to my body.”\nBut a different career still isn’t an option. Divina is the breadwinner for her family back in the Philippines. “Without me they cannot live. They cannot afford an apartment ... how are they going to buy food?”\nDivina was beaten by her father as a child when she started displaying signs she wanted to be a girl, turning her shorts into a skirt and making dolls out of paper. She was abandoned by her mother, separated from her siblings and put into foster care. But like many other transgender women, she has shown remarkable resilience and a fierce determination to be herself.\nNora, who transitioned at 47 and now works the streets at 51, was also neglected and beaten as a child growing up in Greece. When her father found a photo of her dressed as a woman, when she was still living as a man in a heterosexual marriage, he shot her.\nDealing with mental and physical illness and abject poverty, she turned to sex work and drugs as a lifeline. “I am what I am,” she told the program. “Take drugs, and prostitution. All my clients and all my partners, they’re not normal people, they don’t have a day job ... but I am good. I’m a good person. I am trying.”\nBeautiful, talented — and outcasts. Source: ABC\nWorldwide, hate-motivated violence against transgender people is on the rise. Abuse and even murder occurs at a much higher rate than for the general population, yet these women are forced to meet strange men in apartments and hotels.\n“You don’t know who’s going to walk through that door,” one woman told Four Corners . And for the next hour, you are completely under their control.\nJournalist Caro said she was particularly struck by how much humour these women were able to bring to their daily lives and when telling their painful stories. “They have challenges in life beyond what most of us will endure,” she said. “And they still have smiles on their faces.\n“They’ve paid a very big price for wanting to be who they are. They deserve more. Why aren’t things better yet?”\nCaro believes we need to harness the energy in the trans movement right now and start a conversation about equality for trans people, particularly in the workplace.\nDaniella, a talented stylist who couldn’t find work in the fashion industry, says she’s tired of seeing her transgender friends working as escorts or in “basic” jobs, cut off from reaching their potential and marginalised by Australian society.\n“I want to feel love,” she said. “But it’s not love that I’m getting because, having to have sex with men every single day, it’s killing my soul.”\nNow is our chance to change that story.\nCaro Meldrum-Hanna’s report on transgender escorts airs on Four Corners tonight at 8.30pm on ABC.
