While trains have always been a beloved part of California's history, nothing brings people together like a common, undead enemy.\nThe reimagined 40-minute train ride takes its passengers through a post-apocalyptic world desolated by infection and overrun by zombies. The Zombie Train will be evacuating passengers on a quest for safety; however, safety may be hard to find with zombie encounters on and off the train.\n\"We are excited to debut Zombie Train: Evacuation on all three of our trains this year,\" said Chris Hart , president of the tourism division of Sierra Railroad. \"We've developed the Zombie Train franchise over the past few years, and this year, we've overhauled the experience to offer families of Northern California a chance to experience train travel in an exciting and unexpected way.\"\nZombie Train: Evacuation offers a mix of special effects, live-action adventure, and the main attraction-zombies! At $35 for adults and $25 for children ages 2-12, this experience is family friendly-we trust your discretion as to whether your child is prepared for slightly spooky zombie encounters. Plus, there is a limited number of tickets available to become part of the action with your very own zombie makeover.\nOn which side will you be when the evacuation comes? For more information, ticketing, and event dates, please go to www.ZombieTrain.com and select your departure location.\nFor media professionals interested in covering the train, a limited quantity of media passes is available.\nSacramento RiverTrain : Providing a unique venue for family entertainment and excursions, the Sacramento RiverTrain offers year-round experiences sure to animate the kid in all of us. http://sacramentorivertrain.com/\nSierra DinnerTrain : Operating the 3rd oldest rail line in North America , the Sierra DinnerTrain meanders through the countryside, seemingly unspoiled by time.
