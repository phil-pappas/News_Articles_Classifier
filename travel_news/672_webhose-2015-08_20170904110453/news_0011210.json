Now, visitors to Siem Reap can not only try this popular snack but also cook it with the new Fear Factor Challenge from Backstreet Academy , a Southeast Asia travel company offering unusual ways to learn about a destination. The activity is hosted by Ratana, the owner of a street stall in the city who sells the specialty, and on the excursion, he teaches guests how to fry them and talks about various garnishes like basil leaves, fried garlic and spices. The challenge kicks in when it’s time for travelers to eat what they have prepared. The cost is $19 a person. AT ROCHESTER MUSEUM, A TRIBUTE TO TOYS The Strong , a museum in Rochester, N.Y., which has more than 400,000 objects on display related to play, is opening a $4 million permanent exhibition on Sept. 18 called Toy Halls of Fame. The 5,000-square-foot exhibition features a collection of 300 classic toys such as the oldest known jigsaw puzzle from 1766, one of the oldest Monopoly games manufactured from 1934 and a three-foot-tall Crayola crayon made out of Legos. Guests can use touch-screen kiosks to learn about the history of different toys and play virtual games such as building a 20-foot-tall bubble tower. The exhibit isn’t just for kids, says Christopher Bensch, the museum’s vice president of collections. “These toys are beloved by all generations, and even adults will have fun seeing them,” he said. Admission is $13.50. CELEBRATING SEAFOOD AT NEW ZEALAND FESTIVALS Fall might be approaching in the United States, but New Zealand is heading into spring — the peak season for seafood. Travelers can savor local crustaceans at two coming food festivals. The Whitianga Scallop Festival , one of the country’s most popular attractions, will be held on Sept. 19 on the picturesque Coromandel Peninsula on the North Island. Attendees can enjoy the namesake shellfish in a variety of ways including as shots, simply sautéed and as kebabs. There is also an area where local chefs will prepare scallop recipes. Admission is 45 New Zealand dollars ($30). Kaikoura Seafest is scheduled for Oct. 3 in the town of Kaikoura on the South Island. It features several dozen stalls serving a variety of seafood such as crayfish, green-lipped mussels and tiny whitebait fish. Wine from the nearby Kaikoura, Marlborough and Canterbury regions also will be featured. Admission is 40 New Zealand dollars ($27).
