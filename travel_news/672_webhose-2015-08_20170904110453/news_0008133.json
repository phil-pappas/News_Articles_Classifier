Following Birmingham International Airport’s launch of direct flights to and from Beijing, Hogarths Hotel & Restaurant, based in Four Ashes Road in Dorridge, joined Solihull Tourism Forum in taking part in the GREAT China Welcome programme. \nHogarths’ operations manager Adam Bessant and Brasserie manager Ellie Beattie have been involved in the China Welcome training session in an effort to understand Chinese culture so they can accommodate their new guests in the best possible manner. Programme participants learnt about Chinese traditions and etiquette including good luck charms for guests’ rooms as well as the types of food that are favoured by Asian visitors. The duo have also learnt how to say hello and other basic phrases in Mandarin, and will be putting their new skills to the test when they and a group of other local businesses greet a direct flight of 230 passengers at Birmingham International Airport on Monday, August 24. The passengers will have flown direct from Beijing and are expected to touch down at 6.35am. Adam Bessant, of Hogarths’ Hotel & Restaurant, said: “Birmingham International is now the first and only airport outside of London to offer direct flights to and from the Chinese capital. “What’s more, reports have shown these flights could be worth up to £19 million to the local economy, demonstrating that the services have great tourism potential which will in turn raise the region’s profile. “The West Midlands has a vibrant culture and historical heritage with many experiences and attractions on offer, so Hogarths saw this as a fantastic opportunity to showcase our services to tourists who may not have visited otherwise. “Hogarths prides itself on attracting a diverse range of guests and we wanted to make sure we were equipped to ensure our Chinese guests’ experiences are memorable. “Entering the programme has been an exciting and broadening experience which has helped the team to ensure it is armed with the cultural expertise to welcome the new wave of tourists and make their visit thoroughly enjoyable.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T17:25:06.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
