(NASDAQ: SORL) (\"SORL\" or the \"Company\"), a leading manufacturer and distributor of automotive brake systems as well as other key safety-related auto parts in China , today announced its unaudited financial results for the second quarter of 2015 and the first six months ended June 30, 2015 .\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights\nSales were $59.3 million compared with $65.7 million in the second quarter last year; Gross margin was 27.9% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 28.2% in the same period of 2014; Net Income attributable to stockholders was $2.3 million , or $0.12 per diluted share compared with $4.1 million , or $0.21 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2014. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $70.3 million with a current ratio of 3.31 to 1 at June 30, 2015 ; Net cash flow from operating activities was approximately $16.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 ; Annual guidance was revised for sales of $240.0 million and net income of $14.0 million . Mr. Xiaoping Zhang , SORL's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, stated, \"We experienced a solid quarter in a challenging second quarter due to an industrywide decline in commercial vehicle sales in China as well as in international markets. We outperformed key markets as the heavy-duty truck market declined more than 25% in the second quarter.\n\"We continue to invest in new products to position us in markets that will benefit from the Chinese government's policies and spending. We are targeting the bus and railway brake markets where our technology can be used to improve the performance and safety of public transportation vehicles. We look for additional growth opportunities in additional market segments as well.\"\n\"We are encouraged by the actions of the Chinese government to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates and increased investments in public housing and new railroad lines. These measures should increase demand for commercial vehicles and our braking systems.\"\nMs. Jinrui Yu , SORL's Chief Operating Officer, commented, \"We have enhanced our research and development to provide a broad product portfolio of advanced products to enhance our market position. New products provide more opportunities in the OEM, aftermarket and international markets. We have controlled our costs and reduced our inventory levels for the current environment. To strengthen our cost structure, we have invested in advanced production equipment to improve our per unit cost and make our products more competitive in a price sensitive environment.\"\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Performance\nFor the second quarter of 2015, net sales decreased by 9.7% to $59.3 million from $65.7 million for the second quarter of 2014. Revenues from the Company's domestic OEM customers decreased by 11.0% to $28.4 million from $31.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Sales from China's domestic aftermarket decreased 9.1% to $14.0 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $15.4 million in the same quarter of 2014. Revenues from international markets decreased 8.2% to $16.9 million , compared to $18.4 million in the second quarter of 2014 .\nThe gross profit for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 10.7% to $16.5 million from $18.5 million for the second quarter of 2014. Gross margin for the second quarter of 2015 was 27.9%, compared with a gross margin of 28.2% in the same quarter of 2014. The decline in gross margin was due to temporary price promotions to capture market share and higher labor expenses.\nOperating expenses increased to $14.4 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $13.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in operating expenses in the second quarter of 2015 primarily reflected higher general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 24.2% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with 20.4% in the second quarter of 2014.\nSelling and distribution expenses were $5.1 million , or 8.6% of quarterly revenues, compared with $6.5 million , or 9.8% in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease was mainly due to lower freight expense. General and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses in the second quarter of 2015 were $7.4 million , or 12.5% of revenue, compared with $4.7 million , or 7.2% in the second quarter of 2014. The increase in expenses was mainly due to an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of 2015. While accounts receivable has increased due to slower payments, many of SORL's customers are state-owned OEMs and it is expected that these doubtful accounts will be collected in the future. Research and development (\"R&D\") expenses were $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared with $2.2 million in the same quarter of 2014. As a percentage of revenue, R&D was 3.1% in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with 3.3% of revenue in the second quarter of 2014. The R&D program continues to mainly focus on the development of new, higher-margin, electronically controlled mechatronic products and to upgrade the Company's traditional brake products. Financial expenses were $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2015, similar to the second quarter of 2014.\nIncome before provision for income taxes was $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $5.2 million for the second quarter of 2014. The lower income reflected lower sales and gross profit with higher G&A expenses compared with the same quarter of 2014. The pretax income margin was 5.5% in the second quarter of 2015, compared with 8.0% in the second quarter of 2014.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.8 million , or a 24.3% tax rate, in the second quarter of 2015, which is compared with $0.7 million , or a 12.4% tax rate, in the second quarter in 2014. The increase in tax rate was mainly due to the continuing reassessment of SORL being a High-Tech Enterprise in 2015. Once the assessment is complete and the Company receives this designation, it is expected that the tax rate will be re-calculated to 15.0%.\nNet income attributable to stockholders for the second quarter of 2015 was $2.3 million , or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, compared with $4.1 million , or $0.21 on per basic and diluted share, in the second quarter of 2014.\nFirst Six Months 2015 Financial Performance\nNet sales for the first six months of 2015 decreased 3.6% to $111.5 million from $115.7 million for the first six months of 2014. Sales from the Company's China OEM customers decreased 10.2% to $54.3 million from $60.5 million in the same period in 2014. Revenues from China's domestic aftermarket increased 1.9% to $26.4 million from $25.9 million in the first six months of 2014. Revenues from international markets increased 5.1% to $30.8 million from $29.3 million in the first six months of 2014.\nGross profit for the first six months of 2015 decreased 10.7% to $30.3 million from $33.9 million in the same period in 2014. Gross margin for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , decreased to 27.1% from 29.3% for the first six months of 2014.\nOperating income for the first six months of 2015 decreased to $7.2 million from $9.9 million in the same period in 2014. Operating margin was 6.4% versus 8.6% in first six months of 2014.\nNet income attributable to stockholders for the first six months of 2015 was $5.3 million , or $0.28 per basic and diluted share, compared with $6.9 million , or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, in the same period in 2014.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $70.3 million . Total equity increased to $226.0 million at June 30, 2015 compared with $220.2 million at December 31, 2014 . On June 30, 2015 , working capital was $169.6 million with a current ratio of 3.31 to 1. Net cash flow from operating activities was approximately $16.1 million for the six months ended June 30 , 2015.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the fiscal year 2015, management has revised its expectation for sales to be approximately $240.0 million and net income to be approximately $14.0 million . These targets are based on the Company's current views on the operating and market conditions, which are subject to change.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Friday, August 14, 2015 at 8:00 a.m. EDT / 8:00 p.m. Beijing Time to discuss its 2015 second quarter and six month financial results.
