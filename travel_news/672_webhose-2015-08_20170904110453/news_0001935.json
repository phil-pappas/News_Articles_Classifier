The report is the only air transport report which includes all types of civil aviation passenger flights: network, low cost, charter and others.\nFrom January to end June this year, passenger traffic at Europe’s airport grew by +4.5%. Freight traffic across the European airport network grew by +0.5%. Aircraft movements were up +2.0%, reflecting additional airline capacity in the market.\nOlivier Jankovec, Director General of ACI EUROPE said “The first half of this year has seen solid passenger traffic growth for the European airport industry. However, where as recently as 18 months ago Non-EU airports were propping up weaker passenger traffic growth at EU airports, we are now through the looking glass. The situation has flipped and EU airports now lead the growth – reporting +5.1% during the first half of the year, compared with +2.3% at Non-EU airports.”\nHe added “This reversed trend in passenger traffic growth is likely to stay for the rest of the year, mainly due to continued weakness in the Russian economy as well as the impact of lower oil prices on the Norwegian economy. Meanwhile, EU economies keep improving, in particular with the former bailed out economies of Ireland, Spain and Portugal surging ahead.\nGeopolitical instability and renewed terrorist threats in North Africa are also redirecting some leisure traffic to EU destinations. As for freight, the situation in Russia as well as slower growth in emerging markets is likely to keep constraining traffic performance.”\nFor the first half of 2015, airports welcoming more than 25 million passengers per year (Group 1), airports welcoming between 10 and 25 million passengers (Group 2), airports welcoming between 5 and 10 million passengers (Group 3) and airports welcoming less than 5 million passengers per year (Group 4) reported an average adjustment +3.0%,\n+5.5%, +6.3% and +5.5%.\nDuring H1 2015, the airports which reported the highest increases in passenger traffic are as follows:\nGROUP 1: Madrid (+11.4%) Istanbul IST (+6.4%), London LGW (+5.4%), Amsterdam (+5.0%) and Barcelona (+4.8%)\nGROUP 2: Athens (+23.3%), London STN (+16.9%),Istanbul SAW (+16.6%), Dublin (+15.1%) and Lisbon (+13.0%)\nGROUP 3: Milan BGY (+32.1%), Porto (+16.8%), Glasgow (+13.8%), Bucharest OTP (+12.6%) and Budapest (+11.8%)\nGROUP 4: Santorini (+33.2%), Sibiu (+32.3%), Cluj (+30.5%), Astrakhan (+29.5%) and Ponta Delgada (+29.1%)\nJUNE FIGURES\nDuring the month of June, passenger traffic was up 3.2%, while freight was up 3.0% and movements reported +2.4%.\nAirports welcoming more than 25 million passengers per year (Group 1),\nairports welcoming between 10 and 25 million passengers (Group 2),\nairports welcoming between 5 and 10 million passengers (Group 3) and\nairports welcoming less than 5 million passengers per year (Group 4)\nreported an average adjustment +2.1%, +4.0%, +4.2% and +3.3%.\nFor June, the airports which reported the highest increases in passenger\ntraffic are as follows:\nGROUP 1: Madrid (+11.3%), Istanbul IST (+6.5%), Amsterdam (+5.8%), London LGW (+5.2%), Frankfurt & Munich (+2.8%)\nGROUP 2: Athens (+21.9%), Dublin (+18.0%), Lisbon (+12.7%), Istanbul SAW (+12.3%) and London STN (+11.0%)\nGROUP 3: Porto OPO (+18.5%), Milan BGY (+14.5%), Glasgow (+14.1%), Berlin SXF (+11.9%) and Budapest (+11.8%)\nGROUP 4: Chambery (+316.7%), Chisinau (+38.8%), Ohrid (+31.6%), Ponta Delgada (+31.1%) and Astrakhan (+30.0%)\nThe ‘ACI EUROPE Airport Traffic Report – June, Q2 & H1’ includes 211 airports in total representing more than 88% of European air passenger traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T18:56:29.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
