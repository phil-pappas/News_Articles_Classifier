The FAA told Philadelphia's WCAU-TV that the pilot of the Piper PA28 spotted the drone when he was about 1,000 feet over Washington Township, Gloucester County, on Sunday. \nThe pilot said he was forced to make an evasive turn to avoid hitting the drone. \nFAA rules don't permit unmanned objects above 400 feet. \nU.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the FAA to implement so-called geofencing. He said it would enable drone-makers to program the devices to be unable to fly within 2 miles of any airport, above 500 feet and near any sensitive positions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T08:33:20.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
