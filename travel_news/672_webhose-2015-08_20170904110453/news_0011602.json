Before the last run-up to $130, we can also see a lot of volume around the $80 area. Looking closely, we can also see a bump in volume around $100. Apple has been attracted to this volume recently. \nThe second Apple chart above shows the daily volume along the bottom. Notice the volume spikes when Apple turnover surged to 150 million shares, as we saw on Monday. There was a 150- million-share day back in late January as Apple rallied from the $105 area to more than $130. \nThe third Apple chart shows a close-only chart vs. a 12- day price momentum study (M=v-vx -- or momentum is today's price minus the price x days ago or, here, 12-days ago). Notice the first decline starting in mid-July to early August with Apple traveling from more than $130 to around $115. \nMomentum readings go sharply lower on the chart. The decline in August goes from around $117 to around $104 and momentum indicator does not go as deep as it did in early August -- a higher low is made on the momentum chart while the price chart made a lower low (first low at $115 and the second low around $104). \nSo instead of following the money, we should follow the volume and look for Apple to re-base around $100 in the days and weeks ahead. \nShares of Apple continued to rally today, up more than 5% to around $109 after touching a 52-week low yesterday of $92, as the market sold off and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 1,000 points in early trading. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates APPLE INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate APPLE INC (AAPL) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income, robust revenue growth and notable return on equity. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Looking at where the stock is today compared to one year ago, we find that it is not only higher, but it has also clearly outperformed the rise in the S&P 500 over the same period. Although other factors naturally played a role, the company's strong earnings growth was key. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. APPLE INC has improved earnings per share by 44.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, APPLE INC increased its bottom line by earning $6.43 versus $5.66 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.13 versus $6.43). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has greatly exceeded that of the S&P 500, but is less than that of the Computers & Peripherals industry average. The net income increased by 37.8% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $7,748.00 million to $10,677.00 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 36.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 32.5%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. Current return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. When compared to other companies in the Computers & Peripherals industry and the overall market, APPLE INC's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500.
