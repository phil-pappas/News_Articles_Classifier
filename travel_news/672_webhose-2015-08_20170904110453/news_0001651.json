This is part of a nationwide scheme spanning 22 cities, funded by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMA). \nThe free internet service CityConnectWiFi can be accessed from any wireless enabled device and has been designed to provide a fast and secure user experience. Although we have had free WiFi for some time, this is quicker and simpler than ever. Cllr James Alexander, leader of City of York Council said: \"Having access to free WiFi is essential for a thriving business community in today's marketplace. The network will also prove an invaluable resource in supporting the council's work to further understand and monitor how the city centre is used in order for the city to prosper and grow\".
