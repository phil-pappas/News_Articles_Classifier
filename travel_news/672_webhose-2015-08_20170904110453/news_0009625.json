But it's the solar panels on the roof that make it a contender for going long distances without an electric top up because the car can store power while it's charging from the sun while in motion. The combined battery and solar range of the Immortus is expected to be around 550 km at an average of 85 km per hour.[caption id=\"attachment_8387\" align=\"\" width=\"1060\"] The Immortus which will be shown in Las Vegas at the trade show SEMA in November 2015[/caption]According to the spec sheets on the yet to be revealed car, the Immortus is a quarter ton 40 kilowatt composite roadster for two. Measuring in at 16 feet and five inches (five meters) by 6 feet, 7 inches (two meters) the car is engineered to go from 0 to 62 mph (100 km) in under seven seconds.It has a combined battery and solar range of over 341.7 miles (550km) at an average speed of 52.9 mph (85 kmh).It's not a Tesla, but you've got to start somewhere.", "external_links": ["http://www.semashow.com/", "http://www.evxventures.com/news/aussie-solar-car-startup-to-showcase-at-sema-2015", "http://www.evxventures.com/the-immortus.html"], "published": "2015-08-31T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T19:53:29.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
