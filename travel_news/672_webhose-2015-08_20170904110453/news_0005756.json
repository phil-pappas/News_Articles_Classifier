That was a feeling that I had that had been growing for a long time and I feel that Labour has lost touch with lots of people out there and it was back then that I decided that I wanted to lead the party and I am fighting for the soul of the party right now.\" What do you think would be the single best and worst aspects of being party leader? \"People do ask 'why are you applying for what is probably the worst job in politics?' It is the ability to change things, to put forward a vision that is your vision and if you can bring people in behind that it would be a great thing. That is why we are in politics, to change things, to change the world, believe it or not. So that would be the best thing. The worst thing would be time away from the family. Modern politics takes a massive toll on people in terms of the demands it makes and the intrusions into private time. But the family are behind me and we are all doing this together.\" Which non-politician would you most like to have in your shadow cabinet? \"That's a good question. I want people who are passionate and driven about things and the big issue for me is care, care of older people, and the person who has always stood out to me in terms of speaking with a real sense of commitment is Fiona Phillips. I think that she is someone the public relate to and is also somebody who believes what she says. She is my kind of person.\" Who is your favourite Conservative MP? \"John Bercow, but I'm not sure he still counts does he? I have always got on very well with Simon Burns. We've always had quite a good, friendly relationship. We were on the health select committee years ago and then when he was a health minister and I was challenging him, we managed to keep it friendly and we have always had a good laugh together.\" Have you kept your MPs' pay rise? \"No, I am giving it away. I am giving it to a local charity in Leigh which supports families in crisis and runs food banks as well. I personally do not see how, in the current climate when public sector workers are in the middle of a decade of pay cuts, that this award can be given. It will further erode trust in politics and I was pretty clear from the start: when it was first suggested I said then that I wouldn't take it and I haven't.\" John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons Photo: PA What would you cook to impress the judges on The Great British Bake Off? \"Oh my goodness. It is a programme we watch a lot. My daughter cried at it the other day when the bottom of someone's cake fell out, so it does arouse quite a few emotions in our house. Cakes are not my strong point. I would probably do something very simple like, I don't know ... a Victoria sponge or something. Don't go for the big one.\" Where are you going or have you been on holiday this year? \"I have had a number of short breaks, not long, not out of the country necessarily. I went to Majorca briefly. I have had a bit of time back at home but my focus is this leadership election.\" What one thing would you promise today's 13 year olds to persuade them to vote labour in 2020? \"It has to be a big change to university fees, I think. The idea that these young people can start life with a millstone of debt hung around their necks, I just don't think it's on. Particularly then when you look at the housing ladder. \"Young people are beginning to get a sense that the odds are just stacked against them and so if I were them, I would be saying 'well, who is looking at the issues that matter to young people and who is making it easier for us to make our way in the world'. \"I think they are looking for big changes in the way education is paid for and I am suggesting we come away from the system of tuition fees and move towards a graduate tax that people pay over their lives. It is not possible to make universities completely free again but I think this is a much fairer way that young people might say 'OK, that would matter to me' - as well as getting rid of the youth rate national minimum wage and extending the national living wage to all ages. We cannot have this two-tier workforce dividing young from old. It is time to help them on their way a little bit and even up the odds.\" What would you do if you weren't a politician? \"I think I long since abandoned hopes of turning out at Goodison. I was a decent cricketer in my day, probably better than footballer actually, and I would love to have done anything there. \"But probably most likely a teacher. Both of my brothers are teachers and I guess that's where I would want to be, where I feel I'd make a difference.\" Would you share a stage with David Cameron for the Yes campaign in the EU referendum? \"No, I wouldn't be planning to. I have been very clear that Labour needs to run a separate Yes campaign to make its own case on Europe. We have got to learn the lessons of the Scottish referendum where it looked like the political establishment was all cosying up together, I don't think it works. \"I think people need to hear the distinctive positions of the different parties and I am pretty clear that Labour will make its separate case to remain in the EU.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:57:18.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
