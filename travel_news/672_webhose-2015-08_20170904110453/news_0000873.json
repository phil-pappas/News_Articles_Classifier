Hoplamazian, president and chief executive officer of Hyatt Hotels Corporation. “We made good progress in the second quarter against our long-term strategy of generating systemwide growth, with a focus on quality throughout our locations and returning capital to shareholders.”\nSecond quarter 2015 financial results are as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA was $210 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $231 million in the second quarter of 2014, a decrease of 9.1%. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2015 was negatively impacted by $25 million due to net dispositions and $8 million due to net unfavorable currency impacts, compared to the second quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted for special items, net income attributable to Hyatt was $41 million, or $0.28 per share, during the second quarter of 2015 compared to net income attributable to Hyatt of $72 million, or $0.47 per share, during the second quarter of 2014.\nNet income attributable to Hyatt was $40 million, or $0.27 per share, during the second quarter of 2015 compared to net income attributable to Hyatt of $74 million, or $0.48 per share, in the second quarter of 2014.\nComparable owned and leased hotels RevPAR increased 1.5% (4.8% excluding the effect of currency) in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014.\nComparable owned and leased hotels operating margins increased 120 basis points in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. Owned and leased hotels operating margins increased 20 basis points in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014.\nComparable systemwide RevPAR increased 2.2% (5.6% excluding the effect of currency) in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014.\nComparable U.S. full service hotel RevPAR increased 7.5% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014. Comparable U.S. select service hotel RevPAR increased 7.2% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the second quarter of 2014.\nNineteen hotels were opened during the second quarter of 2015 – the most organic growth in any single quarter since Hyatt’s IPO in 2009. The new hotels were opened across six brands, including the first two Hyatt Centric-branded hotels, and represent entry into eight new markets.\nThe Company repurchased 2,686,374 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $58.42 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $157 million.\nOn July 30, 2015, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $400 million of common stock. The authorization applies to the repurchase of Class A and/or Class B shares.\nMr. Hoplamazian continued, “One of our key competitive strengths is our distinct business model – which includes the ownership, management and franchising of hotels. This model performed well during the second quarter. Our comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin expansion further demonstrates the operating leverage inherent in that portfolio. The management and franchising of our hotels led to total fee growth of 13% during the first half of 2015.\n“As to operating performance, we continue to see the benefits of a strong lodging cycle and our differentiated offering. Additionally, our base of executed contracts remains healthy and we expect it to drive fee growth over time. We are on track to open approximately 50 hotels in 2015. We remain focused on opening new hotels across multiple geographies to expand our presence in markets where our guests are traveling and where we believe our unique brands can deliver a distinct guest experience while driving value.\n“Consistent with our practice of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased $157 million of shares during the second quarter and $25 million of shares during the month of July.\n“Moving forward, we continue to have a positive outlook as we remain on track to deliver on our long-term strategy. We expect operating performance at our hotels in the United States to remain strong from continued economic growth and strong group trends, as well as relatively low levels of new supply growth in most markets. Internationally, despite varied economic conditions, we believe that our brands will continue to resonate with owners and guests over the long-term.”\nOwned and Leased Hotels Segment\nTotal segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10.8% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nOwned and leased hotels Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8.3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is a non-GAAP measure. We define consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures Adjusted EBITDA based on our ownership percentage of each venture, adjusted to exclude the following items:\nequity earnings (losses) from unconsolidated hospitality ventures;\nasset impairments;\ngains on sales of real estate;\nother income (loss), net;\nnet income attributable to noncontrolling interests;\ndepreciation and amortization;\ninterest expense; and\nprovision for income taxes.\nWe calculate consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by adding the Adjusted EBITDA of each of our reportable segments to corporate and other Adjusted EBITDA.\nOur board of directors and executive management team focus on Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Adjusted EBITDA assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis. Our president and chief executive officer, who is our chief operating decision maker, also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, by assessing the Adjusted EBITDA of each segment. In addition, the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, segment Adjusted EBITDA or some combination of both.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that we use internally for purposes of assessing our operating performance and making selected compensation decisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a substitute for net income attributable to Hyatt Hotels Corporation, net income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure prescribed by GAAP. There are limitations to using non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations, other companies in our industry may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use Adjusted EBITDA or similarly named non-GAAP measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Our management compensates for these limitations by reference to our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally.\nAdjusted Selling, General, and Administrative Expense\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses exclude the impact of expenses related to benefit programs funded through rabbi trusts.\nComparable Owned and Leased Hotels Operating Margin\nWe define Comparable Owned and Leased Hotels Operating Margin as the difference between comparable owned and leased hotels revenues and comparable owned and leased hotels expenses. Comparable owned and leased hotels revenues is calculated by removing non-comparable hotels revenues from owned and leased hotels revenues as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income. Comparable owned and leased hotels expenses is calculated by removing both non-comparable owned and leased hotels expenses and the impact of expenses funded through rabbi trusts from owned and leased hotels expenses as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nComparable Hotels\nComparable systemwide hotels represents all properties we manage or franchise (including owned and leased properties) and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. We may use variations of comparable systemwide hotels to specifically refer to comparable systemwide Americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the Americas management and franchising segment, comparable systemwide ASPAC full service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the ASPAC management and franchising segment, or comparable systemwide EAME/SW Asia full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage within the EAME/SW Asia management segment. Comparable operated hotels is defined the same as Comparable systemwide hotels with the exception that it is limited to only those hotels we manage or operate and excludes hotels we franchise. “Comparable owned and leased hotels” represents all properties we own or lease and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage, business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available. Comparable systemwide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in the industry. Non-comparable systemwide hotels or Non-comparable owned and leased hotels represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of comparable as defined above.\nRevenue per Available Room (RevPAR)\nRevPAR is the product of the average daily rate and the average daily occupancy percentage. RevPAR does not include non-room revenues, which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property, such as food and beverage, parking, telephone and other guest service revenues. Our management uses RevPAR to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis. RevPAR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry.\nRevPAR changes that are driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes that are driven predominantly by changes in average room rates. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs), and could also result in increased ancillary revenues (including food and beverage). In contrast, changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as there is no substantial effect on variable costs.\nAverage Daily Rate (ADR)\nADR represents hotel room revenues, divided by total number of rooms sold in a given period. ADR measures average room price attained by a hotel and ADR trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. ADR is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use ADR to assess the pricing levels that we are able to generate by customer group, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy represents the total number of rooms sold divided by the total number of rooms available at a hotel or group of hotels. Occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels’ available capacity. Management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. Occupancy levels also help us determine achievable ADR levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nForward-Looking Statements in this press release, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
