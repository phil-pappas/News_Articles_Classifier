Does that singular piece of paper signal that you are ready to go out and conquer the world? Far from it. According to Harvard Business Review, only 11 per cent of business leaders believe that graduates possess the expertise needed to enter the workforce. So what does this mean for digital marketers ? 1. You’re in good stead Having the right skills on your CV will give you an incredible edge in an increasingly saturated employment base. The lack of digital talent has led to a skills gap that indicates that by 2020 in the UK alone, 150,000 digital jobs will need to be filled, but the resources just will not be there. 2. Traditional marketing is dead Traditional marketing methods are akin to shouting, very loudly, in the street at random people in the hope that some of them pay attention and then some of those actually like what you are shouting about. Digital marketing allows you to tailor a message to an individual and create content that appeals to them, via a huge variety of platforms and devices. It is more of a science, where great design, copywriting and user experience are married together with hard data. Small companies and brands can now compete with the big boys and you do not need a massive budget to be in the mix. All you need is the right skills, the right aptitude and a great understanding of your customer’s needs. In the final analysis, it is all about your customer, and digital marketing allows you to get closer to them than ever before. 3. Industry leaders are telling you what you need to know Forty-four per cent of students think they have been digitally well prepared by their college or university but only 18 per cent of their bosses agree , according to data collected by internships.com and General Assembly. The world's leading digital brands and agencies are aware of the skills gap and they want you to be part of the answer. Facebook, Google, Twitter and PayPal, among others, have worked closely with the Digital Marketing Institute to validate the syllabus for a number of online digital marketing courses that are available through the Learning People. These include: • Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing – for those just starting out in their career • Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Marketing – for those with a good range of experience • Masters in Digital Marketing – for seasoned marketers who want to become experts Solidifying your skills with the de facto standard of digital marketing knowledge has never been easier. 4. Why wouldn’t you want to work in digital marketing? Digital marketing is a career that is constantly evolving, innovating and demanding. No two days are the same. You can be attending a video shoot on Monday, in the edit suite on Tuesday and posting your work to Facebook on Wednesday. Being able to react at the drop of the hat – as Oreo famously did during the 2013 Super Bowl power cut – is the sign of a skilled marketer. The Oreo ad received more than 14,000 retweets and 20,000 likes, with 515 million earned media impressions – five times the number of people who watched the game on TV. Not bad for a marketing campaign that was not planned. 5. Skilled workers earn a great salary Digital marketing professionals can earn £23,000 when starting out, £40,000 for managerial roles and more than £100,000 for digital marketing directors. Professionals with a certification earn, on average, 20 per cent more than people who have no qualified training. 6. Classroom training is old hat Just as traditional marketing is dead, so is old-school learning. Online learning platforms that have been designed with the user fully in mind can provide a richer experience with proven outcomes that stick with you. The need for rigid learning in classrooms the other side of town and at an inappropriate time is also no longer an issue. Fit your learning into your own schedule and study at your own pace, where you want and when you want. Be it at home, on your way to work, on holiday or even in the bath on your iPad. 7. Take the opportunity while it’s there The digital skills gap is an opportunity but, as the luckless Wile E. Coyote knew when it came to his nemesis, Road Runner, it is an opportunity that has to be seized on, or it will be gone before you know it. Every day is a school day and lifelong learning should be your focus. You need to be the best marketer you can be. You need to stand out. How to get started Step up and fill the digital skills gap with a digital marketing qualification from The Learning People, one of Europe’s fastest growing eLearning providers.
