The drive from Columbus should take about six hours. \nThe city is home to Virginia Tech, which the Buckeyes will play Sept. 7. \nFor information about visiting Blacksburg, call 540-443-2008 or visit stepintoblacksburg.org \nFor more information, call the Virginia Tech Visitor Center at 540-231-3548 or visit www.visit.vt.edu Travel \nPowered by Local Corporation By Steve Stephens Dispatch • Sunday August 9, 2015 5:00 AM \nBLACKSBURG, Va. — Payback is a poor excuse for a road trip — unless you’re the hero of an action movie. \nOr an Ohio State football fan. \nThe only blemish on last year’s otherwise perfect Buckeye season came at the hands of the Virginia Tech Hokies in Ohio Stadium. \nThis year, Ohio State will pay the Hokies a visit on Sept. 7. \nPigskin retribution isn’t the only reason to follow the team to Virginia, though. \nFortunately, the lovely Virginia Tech campus is in the lovely little town of Blacksburg, set among the even lovelier Blue Ridge Mountains, less than a six-hour drive from Columbus. \nEven if you’re not a football fan (Woody save us!), a trip to Blacksburg offers a fun getaway featuring good food and drink, beautiful scenery and loads of history. Throw in an on-field beat-down by the Bucks and you’ve got yourself a pretty darn good time. \nOhio State and Virginia Tech are similar in many respects. Both land-grant institutions, the universities were founded within two years of each other in the 1870s. Each is the largest university in its state. (But one has the national championship football team and the other doesn’t .) \nThe Drill Field, a central open area at the center of campus, reminded me of the Oval at Ohio State. But I’d give an edge in architecture to the Hokies. \nMost of the buildings on the verdant Virginia Tech campus are dressed with Hokie stone, an attractive gray dolomite limestone obtained from a university-owned quarry near Blacksburg. Football players traditionally touch a block of Hokie stone before entering the field at Lane Stadium. \nTravelers coming for the game should plan on having a lot of fun, of course. \nBut I’d suggest that any visitor to Virginia Tech take at least a moment to stop at the edge of the Drill Field in front of the main administrative building, Burruss Hall, where Hokie stones are arranged in a low semicircle around a small garden and reviewing stand. \nThe site is the university’s April 16 Memorial, a monument to the faculty members and students killed in a shooting on campus in 2007. Each of the 32 Hokie stones is etched with the name of one victim. \nThe memorial is not just a place for prayers or meditation or remembering those who were lost, but it also serves as a reminder of the things that are really important in this world, putting a bit of perspective on what is, after all, merely a game. \nAnd now, a word about the word Hokie from the admittedly biased perspective of a Buckeye. \nHokie was originally a nonsense word coined for a campus cheer. In the early days of Virginia Tech football, the mascot was a Gobbler, or turkey. \nLater, the gobbler evolved into a less turkeylike HokieBird. But today’s Hokie looks a lot like a turkey. Just check out the giant bronze Hokie in the lobby of the Cassell Coliseum basketball arena. ’Nuff said. \nAt the edge of campus is a wonderful historic site, Smithfield Plantation, built circa 1774, where visitors can learn much about the history of Virginia’s Blue Ridge region, from the Revolutionary War through the Civil War and beyond. \nNow a living-history museum, Smithfield was built by Col. William Preston, a Revolutionary War patriot and land speculator. The plantation was at the fringe of the frontier in an area known for attacks from hostile Native Americans. \nBut Preston, who wanted to encourage others to buy land and locate nearby, built his manor house in the tidewater plantation style, and he and his wife raised 12 children there. He did, however, have the foresight to build a small stockade around his home. \nThe house has been restored to look as it did during the 18th century, with original family and period furniture. The glazed windows, Chippendale railings and fancy mantelpieces evince as much elegance as could be wrested from life at the edge of civilization at the turn of the 19th century. \nNatural beauty abounds in the region around Blacksburg. One especially stunning sight is Cascade Falls, about 20 miles north of town. \nThe falls are at the middle of a 4-mile loop trail. The hike is moderately difficult with many stone steps, but the trail is well-maintained and should be doable for visitors in moderately good health. \nEven those who decide to turn back before reaching the falls will be charmed by the rugged gorge and Little Stony Creek along the way. And the payoff is spectacular for those who persist to the end of the amphitheaterlike gorge: The 69-foot falls descends over naturally tiered stones into a beautiful pool (which is also a popular swimming hole). \nBack in town, visitors will find that the Virginia Tech campus gates open directly out onto Main Street and a variety of restaurants and sports bars in downtown Blacksburg. Just follow the crowds to locate big screens, cheering fans and cold beer. \nFor fine dining, I’d recommend Poor Billy’s or Social House, both popular local eateries. \nBreakfast lovers should also check out the venerable Joe’s Diner, an old-timey place owned by Travis Crawford, the third “Joe” in a line of proprietors that goes back many years. He’s an amiable host, eager to talk about Ohio State’s upcoming visit. \nA big influx of Buckeye fans is expected, and the whole town is eagerly anticipating the rematch, reported Crawford, who is, alas, a University of Michigan fan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:55:07.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
