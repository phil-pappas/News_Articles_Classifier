While parts of Spain and Portugal remain in a long-term drought that has impacted agriculture for several years, Italy and the Balkans have experienced several flooding events. \nAs a result, the rainfall will be largely beneficial for southern France and Spain, helping to elevate soil moisture for crops. Meanwhile, there will be an enhanced risk for flooding problems from Italy into Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Greece and Bulgaria. \nRoys added, \"The highest risk for flooding will be across the Dinaric Alps, Apennines and even parts of the southern slopes of the Alps.\" \nIn this picture taken Saturday, Aug. 1, 2015, people make their way on a flooded street in Florence, Italy. A thunderstorm, hail and fierce winds Saturday evening pummeled \nWhile the storm systems will quickly move through Spain and France, some of the storms will slow down and spin over Italy and southern Balkans for several days, which will also lead to a higher flooding threat throughout the fall season, but especially during October. \nSeasonable Start to be Followed by Storms in British Isles, Northwestern Europe \nThe British Isles escaped the heat for much of the summer as rounds of intense heat traveled from Spain into France then eastward into central and eastern Europe. \nHeat will remain to the east across central and eastern Europe during the early fall, keeping near- to slightly below-normal temperatures across Ireland and the United Kingdom with a cooling northwest flow from the Atlantic being the dominate pattern. \nMeanwhile, areas from Paris to Amsterdam can expect a typical fall season with brief pulses of warmth that will be erased by a cooler northwest flow after only a day or two. \nDuring November, the large ridge over central and eastern Europe will weaken and open the door for storm systems to enter northern Europe. \nStrengthening storms from the Atlantic Ocean will bring the threat for damaging winds to Ireland, the United Kingdom, northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands during late October into November. This pattern is expected to continue into early winter when several powerful wind storms will cross northwestern Europe. \nAgriculture Impacts: Belarus, Ukraine and Russia Drought; Beneficial Rains for Spain \nThe dominant weather patterns of the fall season will have significant impacts on agriculture across Europe. \nThe hot, dry weather that occurred during much of the summer from Belarus and Ukraine into western Russia will persist for most of the fall, resulting in short-term drought that will impact crops across the region. \nAccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Jason Nicholls stated, \"Even though the dry conditions will be beneficial for harvesting, the prolonged drought may result in poor yields for existing crops and also low soil moisture for winter crops that are being planted.\" \nCorn, soybeans and winter wheat could all be adversely impacted by this prolonged drought reducing yields and increasing prices for consumers across Europe into next year. \nIn Spain, crops have suffered in recent years due to a prolonged drought, and there was very little change over the summer as extreme heat and largely dry weather prevailed across the Iberian Peninsula. \nOlive oil prices rose 10 percent from December to July, according to The Guardian. \nThe return of normal rainfall to the olive-growing regions of Spain will be the first step in producing a better crop next year which could ultimately help lower prices to consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:07:55.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
