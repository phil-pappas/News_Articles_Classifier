Aug 26, 2015, 7:15am EDT Industries & Tags Cindy Barth Editor Orlando Business Journal Home of the Day THINKSTOCK For the fifth year in a row, the honesty rate in America has exceeded 90 percent,… more For the fifth year in a row, the honesty rate in America has exceeded 90 percent, according to the results of the 2015 National Honesty Index, a coast-to-coast social experiment conducted by Honest Tea. The index tests the honesty of Americans by setting up unmanned racks of Honest Tea beverages offered for $1 on the honor system. From July 17- Aug. 10, Honest Tea monitored thousands of interactions at 27 different locations across the country to see how honest people are when no one appears to be looking. The results found 94 percent of Americans were honest, down slightly from 95 percent in 2014. Overall, Atlanta was the most honest city in the United States at 100 percent, followed by Indianapolis at 99 percent honest. Providence, Tampa and Boston were found to be the least honest cities during this year’s experiment. As for Orlando, we came in with a 94 percent honesty rating. Here's some other interesting data from Honest Tea: Providence, R.I., remained at the bottom of the list for a second year in a row. One person in Providence paid for his beverage with a fake $1 million bill. For the first time in the history of the experiment, in the nation’s capital someone stole money from the collection box. In Orlando, a little girl purchased a beverage for a police officer, and then took a picture with him in front of the honesty store. Women proved to be more honest than men edging them out 95 percent to 93 percent honest. Brown hair came out as the most honest hair color with 96 percent. Last year’s most honest, blondes, were a close second at 95 percent. Bald individuals were the least honest at 91 percent.

Car-share program ending Sept. 12 as new vendor is sought The car-share program in Orlando is evolving, as a new vendor is being selected in September as the current vendor transitions out of the program. In October 2013, the Florida Department of Transportation’s District 5 Commuter Assistance Program and the city of Orlando partnered with Hertz 24/7 to bring car-share to downtown Orlando. The first phase of the program included 12 vehicles that were available for hourly rentals, as opposed to the 24-hour rental periods available through traditional car rental services. In July, Hertz said it would end its car-sharing service effective Sept. 12. FDOT has advertised an RFP to select a vendor for Phase 2, and project managers expect that selection to take place by Sept. 14, with car-share services re-introduced later this fall. ... Speaking of cars and traffic The 2015 Urban Mobility Scorecard released today offers some interesting insights and data on traffic congestion and commute times. In fact, traffic across the nation is getting worse, the report shows. According to the scorecard, travel delays due to traffic congestion caused drivers across the U.S. to waste more than 3 billion gallons of fuel and kept travelers stuck in their cars for nearly 7 billion extra hours — 42 hours per rush-hour commuter. The total nationwide price tag: $160 billion, or $960 per commuter. In 2014, the average commuter in Orlando spent 46 hours stuck in traffic, costing them each $1,044 in lost time and fuel, according to the report.
