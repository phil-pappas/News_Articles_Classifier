John Hunt Morgan passed by several miles to the south in 1863. \nThis weekend, however, the North and the South will trade fire along the mighty Muskingum River in downtown Zanesville. And visitors who book passage on the Lorena sternwheeler can watch the skirmish from a floating perspective. \nThe riverboat will offer a Friday night cruise and four cruises on Saturday between its dock at Zane’s Landing and Riverside Park, 11/2 miles upstream. Civil War re-enactors on board the boat will exchange cannon and small arms “fire” with re-enactors along the riverbanks. \n“The rides each day are a little different,” said Kelly Ashby, vice president of the Zanesville-Muskingum County Chamber of Commerce. \n“On Friday, you’ll have that nighttime atmosphere; you won’t see the re-enactors (on shore) clearly, but you’ll see the flash of the cannon and firing of the rifles.” \nVisitors on Saturday, however, will get some extra entertainment. Abe and Mary Lincoln are scheduled to cruise that day and talk with passengers. Also scheduled are a Civil War encampment, music and storytelling at Riverside Park and period music performed at Zane’s Landing. \n“The re-enactors are absolutely fabulous to talk with, and they tell great stories,” Ashby said. \n“They’ll tell about their uniforms and weapons — and it’s just fun to watch their interactions” in camp with other re-enactors and visitors, she said. \nVisitors who don’t have boat tickets are welcome to visit the activities at the park and landing, Ashby said. \nThis is the third year that the Lorena will offer the re-enactment cruise, which has become quite popular, Ashby said. \nThe Lorena has a Civil War-era tie. Built in 1949 as the tug Bryce M, the paddle-wheeler came to Zanesville in 1976 and was repurposed to give tours. It was renamed for a riverboat that had offered passage between Zanesville and Pittsburgh in the late 19th century. That original Lorena had been named for a ballad written in 1856 by Zanesville native Henry Webster that became quite popular during the war. \nThe Lorena offers cruises during the warmer months. \n“But this is definitely the only time you’ll see cannon fire,” Ashby said. \nRides will be offered at 9:30 p.m. Friday and 10 a.m., noon, and 2 and 4 p.m. Saturday. The Friday ride will be one hour; the Saturday rides, 90 minutes. \nTickets cost $15 a person; reservations are required. Space is limited to 50 passengers for each cruise. The trips sold out last year. \nCall 1-800-743-2303 or visit www.visitzanesville.com \nSteve Stephens is the Dispatch travel writer.
