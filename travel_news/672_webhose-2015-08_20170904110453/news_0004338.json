Since 2004, through its many established initiatives, the company has helped more than 24,000 people, delivering life-changing medical care, educational supplies, and livestock. RRI is pleased to offer several ongoing programs to people interested in making a difference. \nFor more than 10 years, Relief Riders International has been spearheading de-worming initiatives through its pediatric medical programs . With the highest amount of soil-transmitted helminths in the world, 241 million Indian children are at risk of being infected by parasitic worms. Through RRI’s programs, some 17,000 children have been successfully de-wormed, ensuring their ongoing good health so they can pursue the education they so desperately need. While the Indian government recently re-launched its de-worming plan, RRI is proud to have been involved in this initiative for more than a decade. \nAnother important project RRI has been running since its inceptions is RRI’s Sanitation Program . Approximately 28 million children in rural India do not have adequate toilet facilities in their schools. Those schools that do have bathrooms are often unfinished, unhygienic and are not equipped with water for cleaning. Relief Riders’ interactive health and hygiene education program has helped to reduce diarrheal disease by over 40% and respiratory infections by 30%. Furthermore, the company is also working on building wells and sewage systems to promote cleaner, healthier school facilities. \nNearly half of Indian children under the age of 5 suffering from some form of malnutrition, a direct result of the extreme poverty many of the rural communities are experiencing. Families simply don’t have enough nutritious food to remain healthy. RRI’s “Give a Goat” program addresses this simple need in a practical, sustainable way. In addition to providing nourishment, goat milk or cheese can also be sold to generate income. To date, nearly 400 families’ lives have been changed through this program, which continues to be one of the most powerful and memorable relief ride experiences. \n“Much has been said recently about the poverty-level in rural India. Some say the bar is set too low, while others are vastly underestimating the glaring need that these people have for some of the most fundamental necessities most of us take for granted, like clean water and medical care,” comments RRI Founder Alexander Souri. “Our programs, which have been in place for more than 10 years now, are addressing the true need and making a real difference in changing peoples’ lives for the better. It’s something we’re passionate about and will continue to drive forward for many years to come.” \nFor more information about these and other programs, or to reserve a spot on a future trip, please visit reliefridersinternational.com or contact: Relief Riders International, PO Box 615, Great Barrington, Massachusetts 01230 United States, Phone: (413) 329-5876, email", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T03:20:05.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
