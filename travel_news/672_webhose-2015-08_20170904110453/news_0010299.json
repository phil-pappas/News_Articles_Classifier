The Patriots say they didn’t.\nShortly after news broke the league was investigating the Patriots in the scandal, Mortensen published a report citing “league sources” as saying 11 of the Patriots’ 12 game balls used in the AFC Championship game were 2 PSI under the allowable minimum air pressure. This was later found to be erroneous, and despite criticism from Patriots fans and some peers in the media, Mortensen has so far not taken responsibility for the inaccurate report.\nIn a radio interview earlier this week, Mortensen went so far as to claim Jonathan and Robert Kraft personally apologized to him “for just the way this thing has gone down.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Jonathan Kraft touched on the early coverage of Deflategate in a chat with CBS Boston Sports before the Patriots preseason game against the Panthers Friday, and without naming names, seemed to refute Mortensen’s story:\n“We’ve still never gotten an explanation from the league why the erroneous reports weren’t corrected,” Kraft said. “And I think the sources for the misinformation are the only ones who should be apologizing to the reporters. We haven’t, and we really have no need to.”", "external_links": ["http://itiswhatitis.weei.com/sports/newengland/football/patriots/2015/08/27/espns-chris-mortensen-doubles-down-on-deflategate-story-with-arizona-radio-station/", "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/08/28/jonathan-kraft-we-havent-apologized-to-chris-mortensen-and-we-dont-need-to/"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T18:35:07.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
