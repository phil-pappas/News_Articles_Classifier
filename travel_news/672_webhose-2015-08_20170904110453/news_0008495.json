One resort sends them to guests who ask. In the hotel industry, customer relationship management has evolved to keeping notes on a regular guest’s favorite foods or room preference. But now some of the country’s most celebrated properties are reviving an old service for an even more personalized connection: the house call.\nLuigi Taglialegna, a makeup artist and beauty specialist for the Guerlain Spa in the Towers of the Waldorf Astoria New York, often makes house calls to brides, celebrities and executives, many of them regular guests at the hotel, before weddings and other important events. Often his consultation turns into a lesson in skin care. A makeup application costs $300 plus transportation and gratuity.\nGet Today’s Headlines by E-Mail Each Morning From The New York Times\n“My clients become more open in their own surroundings, and I can better connect with them in order to customize the service to their needs,” Mr. Taglialegna said.\nThe Peninsula Beverly Hills in California often caters at-home dinners for frequent guests during the holidays. It also sends its spa therapists to guests’ homes for treatments like the property’s signature massage: a combination of Swedish, deep tissue and sport massages. The therapists will travel within a five-mile radius of the hotel for a starting cost of $420, including tax, gratuity and travel.\nFor guests of Nantucket Island Resorts , shipments of Nantucket Bay scallops can be arranged. Each of the resort’s properties works closely with local vendors throughout the harvesting season (November to March) to provide fresh scallops shipped the same day, for an average cost of $25 per pound plus shipping fees.\nAt Rosewood’s CordeValle property in San Martin, Calif., Benjy Robins, the tennis director, routinely develops drills for guests to practice once they return home. And now he is taking an extra step. Recently he began making house calls to loyal hotel guests who live within a three-hour drive of the resort. His visits are $110 an hour, the price of a private lesson at the resort. He also runs clinics at guests’ local tennis clubs.\n“ These house calls have become a great way for us to further build lasting relationships with our guests,” Mr. Robins said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://beverlyhills.peninsula.com/en/default", "http://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/cordevalle-northern-california", "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/todaysheadlines", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmca7M%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmffzm.img&description=Loved+the+scallops+in+Nantucket%3f+One+resort+sends+them+to+guests+who+ask.+-+The+New+York+Times", "http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/spa/", "http://www.nytimes.com/?partner=msft_msn", "https://www.nantucketislandresorts.com/"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T07:33:12.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
