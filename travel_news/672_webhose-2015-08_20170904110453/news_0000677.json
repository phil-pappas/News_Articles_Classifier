Royal connections to Scotland are incredibly strong, and so there is no better place to be than our wonderful capital city, launching one of our most exciting new attractions – The Borders Railway.\n“The new Borders Railway, which delves deep into Sir Walter Scott country, presents a huge opportunity for Scottish tourism. The scenery from Edinburgh through Midlothian down to the Scottish Borders and back again is remarkable and I have no doubt that visitors will make the journey just for the experience as well as to visit the many attractions along the way. The romanticism captured by the steam trains that will be traveling on the line during the first six weeks after opening will give the route added value, following in the tracks of the Jacobite steam train journey from Fort William to Mallaig which welcomes thousands of visitors every year.\n“We are excited that we are moving ever closer to the launch of this magnificent new line and we are working with partners to ensure the tourism potential of our Borders Railway is fully realised both nationally and internationally, encouraging visitors to explore yet more of Scotland’s beautiful urban and rural landscapes. We look forward to what will be a truly wonderful official opening event.”\nSource:-Visit scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:21:15.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
