That product, an RFID-blocking travel wallet that can be worn around the neck, is now available for purchase at Amazon.com. \n\nThe product features RFID-blocking  material that can help to prevent identity theft by blocking scanners and RFID readers that are trying to access personal and sensitive information on items like passports and credit cards. It also helps to prevent pickpocketing by being worn around the neck, rather than in a back pocket out of sight.\n\nTravel Navigator Accessories has designed this wallet to meet the most common needs of travelers by including 6 different pockets for storing and organizing. The main pocket is sized for holding unfolded paper bills, and two other large pockets are large enough for passports, boarding passes, and other items. Many smart phones will also fit in these pockets. A small zippered pocket is designed to hold coins, and an internal mesh pocket is sized for a driver's license and credit cards.\n\nIn announcement of the launch on Amazon, Travel Navigator Accessories' John Doe said \"We're thrilled to be able to partner with the world's most successful e-commerce site to make our product easier to purchase and more convenient for customers. Buyers trust Amazon and there are a lot of perks, like free shipping offers, that will benefit our customers. We look forward to serving more customers through this partnership and to adding more products that can be purchased at Amazon.com in the coming months and years.\"\n\nThe company plans to expand its product line to offer other styles of travel wallets and organizers, as well as other convenience and safety-focused travel accessories.\n\nAbout Travel Navigator\n\nTravel Navigator is a newly formed company that is developing a Security travel wallet for travelers. The company is focused on providing safety and convenience-oriented travel accessories for both men and women.
