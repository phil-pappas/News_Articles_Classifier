Ask any parent and they’ll tell you one of the best perks of having children is the opportunity to rediscover the joys of childhood again. From digging out long-forgotten toys to renewing that 20-year-lapsed Beano subscription, it can sometimes seem the case that children are the excuse that parents need to re-indulge in some good old-fashioned fun. And what could be more fun than a soft play centre? There's a reason your kids go mad for the slides, tunnels and ball pits at these places – because they're a brilliant laugh... no matter what your age. The good news? Many soft play centres across the country have caught wind of the wistful looks given by parents watching their little ones play – and are holding special “adult-only” sessions, so you can let loose and revisit your childhood (without having to pretend you’re only in there to help little Timmy). Here are six reasons why you need to slip off your shoes and dive into the ball pit yourself… 1. It's more sophisticated than the usual The events for grown-ups at soft play centres are a little more sophisticated than the usual clambering and sliding stuff that the kids get up to: many will include music, smoke machines, laser lights – as well as organised races, adventure tasks and time trials. 2. It's great fun Once you get past the initial embarrassment, you’ll find it’s great fun. Think of it as a cross between It’s a Knockout , I’m A Celebrity , and a good old-fashioned pillow fight – as well as an opportunity to throw yourself about without fear of injury. 3. It's the perfect activity for groups of people The events are popular with stag and hen dos – but by no means are they limited to the more boisterous parties. As well as team-building and workplace-bonding sessions, they also make for a hilarious (and different) activity to do with your mates. 4. It's good for you It’s not just about fun – there are positive health benefits too. All that running and clambering and bouncing and sliding and diving is going to give you a pretty comprehensive cardiovascular workout, and let you exercise some muscles you may not have used in a while. 5. It's ideal for couples Actually, let’s not kid ourselves – it is mostly about fun – but if you want to use the whole “exercise” excuse as a way of justifying it to your other half, then go for it. Or better still, get them involved too. 6. It's a great party venue Although most adult soft play sessions are alcohol-free (for fairly obvious reasons) some will offer special parties where alcohol is allowed. If you do go to one of these, remember to factor in a certain extra boisterousness… ADVERTISEMENT The joy of movement Whether you’re pushing your body to its limits or just enjoying the great outdoors, trying new activities can sometimes lead to aches and pains.
