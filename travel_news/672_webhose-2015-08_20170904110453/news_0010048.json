This initiative shall replace the old sales commission of US$10 out of US$600 per permit. \nThe complimentary permits will be declared at the end of each quarter, based on the sales performance of the previous quarter. \nThe three year MOU which takes effect on September 1, 2015, is aimed at supporting and strengthening the capacity of Uganda tour operators to market the tourism potential of the country more effectively in the international markets. \nThe two entities believe the MOU will enhance cooperation, increase the sale of gorilla permits, and promote gorilla tourism regionally and internationally. \nSaid AUTO Chairperson Barbara Adoso Van Helleputte, “The sales from the extra permits shall support development programs of the association in the areas of training and marketing.” \nThis comes at a time when industry is in the process of preparing a strategic plan strengthen its trade associations though a United Nations Development Program/Uganda Tourism Board (UNDP/UTB)-funded consultative process. \nCurrently, individual tour operators have to fork out on average of US$4,000 to US$5,000 each in travel, visa, accommodation, exhibitor and travel insurance expenses per exhibition towards international exhibitions in Europe and Japan like WTM London, ITB Berlin, BIT Milan, FITUR Spain, and JATA Japan with no guarantees for a visa. \nAt the signing, UWA Exectutive Director Dr. Andrew Seguya stated that “the number of available permits currently stands at 104 per day, up from 18 in 2006 with 13 gorilla groups fully habituated for tourism in the Bwindi-Mgahinga Conservation Area.” He also called for better and more effective approaches to marketing. \nWith average sales of 90 permits per day, AUTO estimates projections shall hit the US$650,000 mark, greatly offsetting their budget while at the same time mutually benefiting UWA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:06:38.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
