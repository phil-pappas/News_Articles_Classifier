By Brenda Benoit \nWhen I found out about Tacos and Tattoos, I thought that you could order a taco and then get a tattoo in the back room. It turned out not to be that way. This tiny hole-in-the-wall is actually a powerful taco-producing machine that makes the most unusual, creative, exotic and delicious tacos that I have ever tasted outside of Mexico. \nThe chips and salsa are great and plentiful. The tacos are always prepared made-to-order on corn, flour or crispy shells. Our favorite is the churrasco. All are delicious, the crispy version being the most fun to eat. \nThe Pineapple X-Press is a lettuce wrap. Spicy and delicious and made with pork and little chunks of pineapple. \nTacos and Tattoos is very small (I counted 7 tables). The service is super-friendly. You’ll see families; young and old couples alike enjoying a great time and good food. They also serve craft beers in their inviting and tiny ultra-modern bar. \nThe decoration is cozy, with lots of art and odd bits of nostalgia. \nOn Taco Tuesdays you get chicken and pork tacos for $2.00 each \nTacos and Tattoos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:24:45.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
