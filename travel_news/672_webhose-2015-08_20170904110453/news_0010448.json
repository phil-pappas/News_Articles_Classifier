He specifically urged that the eurozone's banking union be completed and warned of the risks from continued doubts about the euro's future.\n\"We must be clear, however: the euro area is an irreversible project, not simply a fixed exchange rate system,\" he said. \"The exit of a member country would inevitably lead economic actors to wonder who would be next, with all the potential destabilizing effects that such speculation could entail.\"\nJust last month, Greece nearly became the first country to exit the currency bloc, as negotiations between the embattled country and its creditors almost failed to reach a deal on a new bailout agreement.\n\"We need to use the confidence in the single currency to build institutions that will reinforce the cohesion of our economic and political union,\" he said.\nMr. Coeuré also said that the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, could \"become the foundation of a 'euro area Treasury'.\"\nWhile the words of the Mr. Coeuré and the ECB on the future of the ESM certainly carry weight, a decision on the ESM lies with governments and not with the central bank.\nWrite to Todd Buell at todd.buell@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T15:56:14.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
