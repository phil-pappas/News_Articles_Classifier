Alaskans have informally called the mountain Denali for years, but the federal government recognizes its name invoking the 25th president, William McKinley, who was born in Ohio and assassinated early in his second term.\n\"With our own sense of reverence for this place, we are officially renaming the mountain Denali in recognition of the traditions of Alaska Natives and the strong support of the people of Alaska,\" said Interior Secretary Sally Jewell.\nOhio politicians reacted angrily, although it wasn't immediately clear if or how they could stop it. Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, said McKinley deserved to be honoured, and invited his colleagues to join him to try to block what he called Obama's \"constitutional overreach.\"\n\"This political stunt is insulting to all Ohioans, and I will be working with the House Committee on Natural Resources to determine what can be done to prevent this action,\" Gibbs said.\nThe announcement came as Obama prepared to open a three-day visit to Alaska aimed at infusing fresh urgency into his call to action on climate change. To the dismay of some Alaska Republicans, the White House has choreographed the trip to showcase melting glaciers and other cherished natural wonders in Alaska that Obama says are threatened by warmer temperatures.\nBut Obama's visit is also geared toward displaying solidarity with Alaska Natives, who face immense economic challenges and have warned of insufficient help from the federal government. As his first stop after arriving in Anchorage on Monday, Obama planned to hold a listening session with Alaska Natives. The president was also expected to announce new steps to help Alaska Native communities on Wednesday when he becomes the first sitting president to visit the Alaska Arctic.\nAt 20,320 feet, the mountain stands as the continent's tallest, and is still growing at a rate of about one millimeter per year, according to the National Park Service. Known for its majestic views, the mountain is dotted with glaciers and covered at the top with snow year-round, with powerful winds that make it difficult for the adventurous few who seek to climb it.\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, who had pushed legislation for years to change the name, said Alaskans were \"honoured\" to recognize the mountain as Denali â€” a change in tone for the Alaska Republican, who had spoken out against Obama's energy policies in anticipation of his visit to her state.\n\"I'd like to thank the president for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honour, respect, and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska,\" Murkowski said in a video message recorded atop the mountain's Ruth Glacier, with cloudy snow-capped peaks behind her.\nBut Ohio Sen, Rob Portman and House Speaker John Boehner joined Gibbs in panning the move, although both stopped short of any threat to try to stop it. Said Boehner, R-Ohio: \"I'm deeply disappointed in this decision.\"\nThe White House pointed out that McKinley had never visited Alaska.\nThe state of Alaska has had a standing request to change the name dating back to 1975, when the legislature passed a resolution and then-Gov. Jay Hammond appealed to the federal government.\nBut those efforts and legislation in Congress have been stymied by members of Ohio's congressional delegation. Even when Mount McKinley National Park was renamed Denali National Park in 1980, the federal government retained Mount McKinley as the name of the actual peak.\nThe White House cited Jewell's authority to change the name, and Jewell issued a secretarial order officially changing it to Denali. The Interior Department said the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had been deferring to Congress since 1977, and cited a 1947 law that allows the Interior Department to change names unilaterally when the board fails to act \"within a reasonable time.\" The board shares responsibility with the Interior Department for naming such landmarks.\nThe peak got its officially recognized name in 1896, when a prospector was exploring mountains in central Alaska, the White House said. Upon hearing the news that McKinley, a Republican, had received his party's nomination to be president, the prospector named it after him and the name was formally recognized.\nObama won't personally visit the mountain during his tour of Alaska. He'll spend much of the trip in Anchorage, south of the peak, where Obama will speak at a climate change summit on Monday. While in Alaska, Obama also planned to meet with fishermen in Dillingham, hike a glacier in Seward and cross the Arctic Circle to visit the rural town of Kotzebue.\nIn an attempt to show Obama wasn't coming to Alaska empty-handed, the White House on Sunday also announced plans to create a \"young engagement program\" to help rural and Alaska Native youth in the Arctic, along with new funding for local fish commissions and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service advisers.\n___\nThiessen reported from Anchorage, Alaska.\n___\nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Mark Thiessen at https://twitter.com/mthiessen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:44:38.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
