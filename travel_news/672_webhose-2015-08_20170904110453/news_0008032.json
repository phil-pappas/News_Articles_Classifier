Now this is an adventure. Picture: Ludovic Hirilmann Source: Flickr \nIT WAS the realisation of a dream from a childhood obsessed with trains: taking one of the world’s longest train rides, on the Trans Mongolian Express and Trans Siberian Railway. \nThe trip went from Beijing, China, via Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and across Russia to Moscow and St Petersburg with whistle stops in between. It spanned two continents, seven time zones, many cultures and more than 7900 kilometres. \nThe logistics are hard to organise on your own, so I travelled with G Adventures. Arriving several days early in Beijing to sample the city, I munched on deep-fried scorpion in a market, climbed ancient drum and bell towers, explored the sprawling Forbidden City and saw the preserved body of Mao Zedong in a mausoleum more resembling the shrine of a deity. Then our tour group — six in all — met for our three-week adventure, led by guide Aleksandr Paramanov. \nA week was spent in close quarters aboard trains. Each car had a hot water boiler, but you had to bring your own food, water and tea and get into the right mindset: Relax, chat with new friends or just gaze at the ever-changing landscape. Or befriend the carriage attendant, buy a few things from her and get on her good side. \nThe Trans Siberian is not a special train with specific runs. It’s a regularly scheduled train; you book sections and get on and off as you wish. Cosy on board the Trans Mongolian Express as it crosses Mongolia's Gobi Desert.

After Chinese officials searched the train and stamped passports in the late evening, the train was taken apart. Carriages were moved into sheds, giant jacks raised them about two metres and wheel bogeys were replaced to handle Mongolia’s gauge rail system. \nWe awoke to see the sandy-brown, scrub-dotted wastes Gobi Desert. Ulaanbaatar, the world’s most remote capital city, comes into view as the train rounds a bend. Yurt tents dot the hills around the city of 1.1 million where more than 100,000 nomads still live under canvas. Welcome to Ulaanbaatar.

Beware of pickpockets not only in the market but throughout the city. I lost my credit cards in a brief bump with someone. \nWe stood amid Buddhist ceremonies with monks chanting and sampled horse cooked on flat metal grills. Later, we slept in a yurt on the steppes (Mongolian plains). A stove for heating needed stoking in the middle of the night. Cows meandered through the camp, the twilight on the distant hills making it seem like a scene from Middle Earth. \nBoarding the train again, we readied ourselves for Russian border officials. Passports were taken, bags searched and sniffer dogs led through the train. The changing face of Ulaanbaatar.

Bathers sweat it out in a sauna, then jump in a cold pool. Back inside, we were thrashed with birch leaves before jumping in the pool again. Then another scrub with coarse sponges, a warm rinse and surprise cold dousing — brutally refreshing. Lake Baikal is beautiful.

A chapel marks the execution spot. All on board! Picture: Nicolas Mirguet Source: Flickr \nOn May 9, we chanced to see the parade marking the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Tanks and missiles rolled through the streets as fighter jets roared overhead. \nBack aboard bound for Moscow, we were split between compartments, attempting communication with friendly but frustrated Russians. \nIn the Russian capital we explored Red Square, the Kremlin as well as Soviet monuments and art galleries. \nThen, more than two weeks after departing Beijing, we boarded a night train for St. Petersburg. \nLeaving that final train was hard. We’d all lived a dream. \nIF YOU GO \nTrans Siberian Railway: Can be taken east to west or vice versa . \nVisas: Requirements vary by country. Consult the Chinese, Mongolian and Russian consular sites. Letters of invitation may be needed for visas. Tour companies can assist. \nTips: Beware of pickpockets. Money belts are a must. Don’t carry all your credit and debit cards together. Pack efficiently — you carry everything you bring. Bring an e-reader for long stretches on the train. \nFood: Some trains have dining cars but don’t count on it. Pack tea or instant coffee to share with fellow travellers. Buy fruit, instant noodles, vegetables, dried meats and bread for days you’ll be on the train.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T04:23:05.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
