Virgin America and Airbnb are offering those who live in the start-up capital of the world a chance to win the ultimate “Work Hard, Hawai’i Hard” escape* with accommodations at an Airbnb estate on Oahu with Virgin Group Founder Sir Richard Branson. The winner will help co-host the airline’s inaugural launch celebration and learn how to “play hard” with professional kiteboarder and ZOZI guru, Susi Mai. Virgin America launches the contest sweepstakes today with an irreverent Magnum P.I. inspired video of Sir Richard Branson making his own mental shift from work to play at his home office and a LinkedIn Influencer post from Branson himself explaining why it’s important to refresh and recharge to do your best work.\n“As the number one destination requested by our Elevate members, we really wanted to take our Hawai’i launch to the next level and give our fans and flyers a chance to be rewarded with the ultimate work escape and getaway– and Airbnb instantly came to mind,” said Luanne Calvert, Chief Marketing Officer at Virgin America. “Both of our brands are about capturing the transformative aspects of travel – and we thought what better way to experience Hawai’i than to do it at an Airbnb property with our Chief of Play Hard, Sir Richard. Together we’ve created a pretty awesome experience for our hard-working winners – and we can’t wait to welcome them onboard our inaugural flight and festivities in November.”\n“Virgin America is one of the best travel brands in the U.S. and now, with the launch of their San Francisco to Hawaii route, the opportunity for us to partner together is fantastic,” said Jonathan Mildenhall, Chief Marketing Officer at Airbnb. “We both offer unique travel experiences generally, but together, we can now offer travelers in Northern California the ultimate bespoke travel experience to Hawaii. The island vacation getaway just got even more magical.”\nTo enter the #Hawaiiscape sweeps, participants must submit their Elevate number and tell us why they need a #Hawaiiscape. For additional chances to win they can share their entry via LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter for a chance to celebrate in paradise with Sir Richard and score a #Hawaiiscape prize package. The grand prize experience will include a festive inaugural flight from San Francisco to Honolulu (return flight included), three-night stay at a luxurious beachfront Airbnb estate with Sir Richard as the Airbnb host on the first night, invitation to all launch celebration activities, and an exclusive lesson from professional kiteboarder and ZOZI Guru Susi Mai, courtesy of tour and activity marketplace, ZOZI.\nThe award-winning airline and Airbnb are also offering a second place winner the chance to experience the inaugural celebration activities, roundtrip flights from San Francisco to Honolulu, a three-night stay at an Airbnb home, among other offerings. The third place winner will receive a $3,000 Airbnb credit and roundtrip flights to Maui. As part of the #Hawaiiscape prize package, all sweeps winners will receive new GoPro HERO4 Session cameras, Avis Car Rental vouchers during their trip, and travel-ready Oru Kayaks. In addition, all winners receive a year of LinkedIn Premium to get the ultimate professional edge when they get back to reality. The first 5,000 fans and flyers who enter the “Work Hard, Hawai’i Hard” sweeps will receive 250 Elevate® points**.\nThe #Hawaiiscape digital promotion was developed in partnership with digital agency One Trick Pony with the Magnum P.I. inspired video filmed by Virgin Group’s entertainment arm – Virgin Produced. Virgin America is also launching a “Work Hard, Hawaii Hard” creative campaign, developed with San Francisco-based agency, Eleven. Targeted towards hard working, entrepreneurial-minded business travelers, the campaign aims to capture the work hard, play hard attitude by leveraging the “Work Hard, Hawai’i Hard” headline while visually encouraging travelers to vacation to the fullest by bringing to life the fantastical elements of experiencing Hawaii. The campaign includes out-of-home and digital ads – specifically targeted to those working late at night.\nAs the only California-based airline, Virgin America will offer Bay Area travelers a fresh and upscale new travel option to the Aloha state, the ‘most wanted’ destination by members of its Elevate® loyalty program. Elevate members can redeem reward flights to Hawai’i – with no black-out dates – starting from 15,100 Points each way. Members can earn more points by signing up for the Virgin America Visa Signature Credit Card.\nHawai’i continues to be the number one visitor destination from the West Coast, with over 3.2 million visitors in 20141. Virgin America’s service is uniquely tailored to the modern traveler and to the longer-haul Hawai’i flight experience. With new aircraft that offer three custom-designed classes of service, touch-screen personal entertainment and an award-winning on-demand food and cocktail menu on every flight, travelers departing from the stylish and convenient new Terminal Two at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) can kick off their Hawai’i vacation as soon as they step onboard. Virgin America has been named the “Best Domestic Airline” Travel + Leisure’s World’s Best Awards for the past eight consecutive years.\nWith a full service First Class menu and a unique on-demand menu in the Main Cabin, Virgin America was named Travel + Leisure’s “Best Domestic Airline for Food” in 2014.
