Each two-day program provides a highly interactive curriculum that develops participants’ leadership skills through group participation.\nIn addition, IAEE selects a “Legend of the Industry” whose contributions, innovation and leadership have been truly unique and remarkable. An informal setting then allows each participant face-to-face interaction with this industry leader. This year’s “Legend” is Lawson Hockman, CEM, Vice President Industry Relations, IMN Solutions. After 45 years in the exhibitions and events industry, Hockman’s experience spans the non- and for-profit arenas in all areas of management and development with a strong emphasis on association operations and financial management, convention/trade show management, membership development, marketing, sales and publications management.\n“Lawson is a greatly accomplished member of the industry and indelible source of knowledge,” noted 2015 IAEE Chairperson Megan Tanel, CEM. “The wisdom he imparted regarding creating a network with your peers and building relationships with your suppliers will serve as a valuable asset to this year’s institute graduates as they continue to hone their leadership skills.”\nIn his role at IMN Solutions, Hockman consults with clients on association management, trade show and meeting management, sales and marketing, vendor selection and vendor contract negotiation, and advance and on-site management. Prior to joining IMN Solutions in 2000, he was Chief Operating Officer for the Anxiety Disorders Association of America (ADAA), where he managed the day-to-day operations. Prior to ADAA, Hockman was Chief Operating Officer for the Environmental Industry Associations (EIA), where he was responsible for overall operations including financial management and oversight, personnel administration, meetings, exhibitions, educational programs, membership, marketing and publications. Prior to joining EIA in 1989, he was with the National Electrical Association (NECA) for more than 19 years, holding positions as Membership Director, Convention/Exposition Director and Assistant Director for Labor Relations.
