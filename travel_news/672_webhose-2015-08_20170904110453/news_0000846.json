We are hoping a Kickstarter campaign will provide the means to do this.”\nContributors to the My Swim Cap Kickstarter Campaign are able to pre-order My Swim Cap 2.0 in time for next summer. “My Swim Cap 2.0 improves on our already much-loved, patent-pending design, making it even more effective at keeping chlorinated water and salt water away from the swimmer’s hair,” explains Dodd.\nDodd says the demand for a better swimming cap is real: “Women are looking for a better swimming cap. Among the most common Internet searches relating to swimming caps are ' a swimming cap that keeps hair dry' and 'a swimming cap that keeps water out.' My Swim Cap has solved this problem for many of its users, and we know this to be true because we receive email after email thanking us for our product.”\nOne such message came in the form of a video testimonial from Lesa Felton of Pheonix, AZ who declared “I swam, I dove underwater, did my exercises and my hair is still dry. Best swim cap in life…in life!’”\nAnother My Swim Cap user, Tanya Patche from Houston, TX wrote “I was told that it is impossible to find a swim cap that keeps hair dry. Thanks so much for creating this swim cap just for me. I'm your biggest fan!’”\nMore such testimonials are highlighted on My Swim Cap’s website.\n“While we have an extremely high customer satisfaction rate, I want to make it even higher, and My Swim Cap 2.0 can do that,” states Dodd. “Now it is time to put My Swim Cap in retail stores. It is my sincere hope that crowd funding via our Kick Starter campaign will make this possible by summer 2016. A lot of women like swimming, fashion and fabulous hair, I just hope enough of them like our product and give some contribution.”\nMy Swim Cap's Kickstarter Campaign runs from August 1, 2015 until September 13, 2015. Rewards are available for contributions starting as low as $2. Contributors can pre-order My Swim Cap 2.0 including the Limited Edition version featuring a design voted on by eligible contributors.\nMy Swim Cap is currently sold online at http://www.myswimcap.com and comes in a variety of colors and sizes including the Diva (for long hair), Unisex Plus, Unisex and Junior.\nQuestions?
