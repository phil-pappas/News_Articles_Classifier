What makes it even more spectacular, is when you watch the sunset from a Grand Canyon helicopter. If you want to get the best sunset air tours, there are some things you'll need to know. Here are some tips you can use to get the best deal on a fantastic flight on the day of your choosing. Sunset Tours Of The South Rim If you will be starting in Arizona rather than Vegas, then touring the South Rim is your best choice, and the added benefit is that it's less crowded in that part of the Grand Canyon. The South Rim flights include a flyover of the pristine wilderness lands located at the North Rim. The standard tour takes about thirty minutes to complete. However, the best option is to take the longer, fifty minute tour because you'll see a lot more. It flies over the same area as the standard tour, but also includes a trip to the eastern edge of the Grand Canyon National Park. Grand Canyon helicopters can't land at the South Rim, but you can still add on a ground tour in a 4x4 off-road vehicle. This tour is about two hours long and lets you see some amazing landmarks up close and personal. Vegas Sunset Tours The Vegas-based tours are very popular because of the sheer number of visitors to the Las Vegas area. One of the big benefits of touring the West Rim is your helicopter is allowed to land in that part of the canyon. You can set down at the top, where you can step out onto the world renowned Skywalk. It's an exhilarating feeling to stand over the Grand Canyon on a bridge with a glass floor. Another popular landing tour comes with a helicopter descent down into the canyon where the chopper then lands on the canyon floor. Here, you'll step out right next to the Colorado River, and enjoy a champagne picnic. You can even buy tickets for a riverboat tour. This is a beautiful tour to take at sunset because you'll get to see the rocks change colors in the setting sun and watch shadows dance along the canyon walls. More Options When you book your flights, you'll be able to choose from either basic or deluxe tours. The tours are the same as far as the sights you see, but they are very different when it comes to the type of aircraft you ride in. Basic tours use older helicopters like the Bell Ranger, whereas deluxe tours use newer EcoStar Grand Canyon helicopters. The seats in the deluxe helicopter cabins are arranged in such a way there are no bad views, plus the views are amazing through the huge wraparound windows, and you'll have extra personal space and a better flying experience. If you can afford the extra for deluxe tickets, then I highly recommend that you choose this option. Finding Deals The lowest prices for Grand Canyon helicopter tours are found online. By booking on the tour operator's website directly, you get to cut out tour operator commissions and booking fees. One important thing to remember is to book your tour early. Booking two weeks in advance is necessary, and if you could make it even earlier, then it would help to ensure that you get the sunset seats on your preferred day. The sunset tours are very popular, so they fill up fast, and you don't want to delay getting your spot locked in. Conclusion The Grand Canyon is one of the most amazing places on earth. The massive canyon is filled with unique rock formations, vibrant colors, and such a variety of beautiful sights you'll never grow tired of looking at it. Sunset air tours show the Grand Canyon at its most majestic. Remember that you'll need to book early, and book online. Whether you go to the West Rim or the South Rim, you'll see nature at it's most beautiful and have the chance for adventure in one of America's most loved national landmarks. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon recommends these top-quality helicopter tours She also recommends you check out these coupons so you can get these flights at a cheaper price: http://grandcanyonhelicopter.org/grand-canyon-helicopter-tour-coupons.html This article was published on 04 Aug 2015 and has been viewed 57 times EasyPublish â„¢ - re-publish this article for free", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:04:09.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
