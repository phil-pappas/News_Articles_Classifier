Claudio Ranieri was an unlikely replacement for Nigel Pearson but the Midlanders have not lost a single ounce of the passion that hauled them to top-flight safety last May. Leicester took just 25 coruscating minutes to put the afternoon beyondsalvation for the hapless Wearsiders, a three-goal burst ripping apartany early-season optimism engendered by manager Dick Advocaat. Ranieri, fondly - and sometimes perhaps not so fondly - known as the tinkerman, has clearly not been tampering with the organisation and determination instilled by Pearson, who lost his job at the King Power earlier in the summer. Ten of yesterday's starting line-up were involved in the final matchof last season. They picked up straight from where they left off, when they won seven of their last nine matches to ensure survival. Ranieri, whose team found themselves top of the nascent Premier League table after their efforts, said: \"It was very important to start well. I asked the players, you finished very well last season. I want to see you restart at the same level, and the performance was very, very good. \"The first half was outstanding, the second half normal, but that's Okay. Today we played like a team and that's what I want. Everybody worked so hard.\" Leicester took just 11 minutes to tear through Sunderland's flimsy rearguard. Marc Albrighton's free-kick received a glancing touch from Jamie Vardy, sufficient to direct it just inside Costel Pantilimon's far post. Seven minutes later Sunderland fell victim to a similar ploy, this time Albrighton's cross was flicked home by Riyad Mahrez. The Algerian heaped further indignities on Sunderland just seven minutes later, cutting into the visitors' penalty area and inducing a clumsy challenge from Lee Cattermole. Referee Lee Mason signalled to the spot and Mahrez coolly sent Pantilimon the wrong way with his penalty. \"They were sharper and a lot better,\" admitted Advocaat. \"My players were not in the right shape. It scared me a little bit the way we played, especially in the first half. We are still learning what we have to do. We know we have to change things. Hopefully we will learn from this.\" And it could have been more. Seconds before Mahrez's first goal, Andy King had unaccountably contrived to miss from barely three yards. With still less than half an hour gone, Vardy's rasping 25-yarder brought the best from Pantilimon. The lanky goalkeeper was all that stood between Sunderland and oblivion after the interval, denying Mahrez and Vardy with spectacular saves. Yet the next goal came completely against the run of play, just beyond the hour mark, at the other end. Adam Johnson slipped the ball forward to that arch-poacher, Jermain Defoe, who slotted past Kasper Schmeichel. That brought a roar of hope from the travelling support but Leicester had nothing to fear. Five minutes later, after another bout of timid Sunderland defending, Albrighton turned from provider to scorer with a low drive from the edge of the penalty area. Substitute Steven Fletcher rose to head Sunderland's second 19 minutes from the end but this was rampant Leicester, and Ranieri's, glorious day.
