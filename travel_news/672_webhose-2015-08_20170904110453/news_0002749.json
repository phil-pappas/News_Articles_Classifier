There are a handful of golf courses in town, and, if the others are comparable to the one I played July 31, Prairie Green, any golfer will be satisfied. The course was in fine condition, weaving through impressive, colossal homes, as well as prairie grasses and marsh wetlands, and rates for all the courses I researched--including Prairie Green-- were affordable. I also enjoyed how each tee box had a stone with a famous golf quote. I should’ve played from a more forward set of tees, as I made this into likely the longest course I’ve attempted, but the three men I played with played from the second-longest set of tees, and my pride wouldn’t allow me to play from easier tees than them. The sheer length, combined with the fact that it was hot and sunny, and the fact I had to walk faster than I’d have liked to keep up with my partners, who were utilizing carts, left me broken, beaten, battered, and bruised by the end of 18. After I surveyed the natives at the course for dining and entertainment options, my esteemed colleague, Nick Cicale, and I journeyed to Bracco on their advice, which happened to be only a few miles from our hotel. Their suggestion was sound, as I got tender Hawaiian Mahi Mahi served atop a pyramid of rice and surrounded by a moat of delicious broth. Later, Nick and I ventured to McNally’s Irish Pub, another crowd-sourced selection, which was disappointing due to a meager crowd and dull atmosphere, although Nick and I did find humor in attempting to understand the rules of the Canadian Football League game playing on the bar TV in front of us--”Why are they punting on third down?!” From there, we felt compelled to explore downtown Sioux Falls, and we alighted upon a rooftop bar. Who doesn’t enjoy a rooftop bar during the summer? In we went, only to discover it wasn’t exactly our kind of place. (Our first clue that we may have stepped into an unusual spot was the bouncer asking us if we wanted to watch the drag show. To be sure, though, the joint was hopping, and, on my way out, I happened to see one of the drag show participants, and she or he--not sure of the correct gender pronoun here--actually looked quite pretty, I must say. The next person down the runway was just a man without a shirt, however, so I realized it was most definitely time to go. At least Nick and I got to feel very cosmopolitan, if only briefly.) We then closed one of downtown’s other fine establishments, where, watching everyone scurry around near closing time, with loyalties shifting by the minute, was like witnessing a game of musical chairs crossed with the evacuation of Saigon. Page 2 of 3 - Hotels in Sioux Falls are abundant, although slightly more expensive than I would've expected, but I have no qualms with our lodging, a Hilton Garden Inn--tough to knock a place with supremely comfortable beds and plush pillows. While Sioux Falls technically has casinos, they are about the size of the hot box Lt. Colonel Nicholson (played by Alec Guinness) got tossed into in “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” and probably as uncomfortable and cheerless, too. No, if you want gaming in the area, best head just across state lines to Iowa to Grand Falls Resort and Casino, approximately 20 minutes from Sioux Falls. My Saturday at this casino got off to an inauspicious start. I called that morning to ask if they had a racebook, as I wanted to play the ponies, and I was told they did. So, imagine my surprise and fury when I arrived and discovered there was no racebook! Either this employee was grossly incompetent, or employees are directed to tell people anything they want to hear just to get them into the casino. Neither is acceptable. They did, fortunately, have craps, which I adore, so, after seething for a few minutes, I elected to make the best of a bad situation and bide my time at the craps table--after all, I was at the casino now, anyway, I may as well take advantage. It was a felicitous choice, as I somehow managed to play for seven hours on the same $100 I started with, which may be a record for me. Sure, in the end I lost it all, but to play that long--and have that much fun--well, I’d consider $100 a bargain. Craps is the most enjoyment you can have on a casino floor, and this table was the most loose, open, and festive atmosphere I’ve ever experienced. In craps, a spirit of camaraderie always congeals among players, but the casino employees at this table genuinely seemed to be rooting for us, as well. Dealers were shouting encouragement, and some of them were even telling novice players how to bet, which I’ve never seen done. The player I stood next to was a genial, gentle giant--he was nearly seven-feet-tall--and he and I quickly developed a rapport, laughing liberally and shouting exhortations at other players and the dice, all accelerated by rounds of cocktails that kept multiplying like the brooms in “Fantasia.” (I think I may have spent more on Johnny Walker Black than at craps. After the first five, I noticed nothing, but, after about seven, I realized I could no longer name all 50 state capitals--a sure sign I’m in trouble--and I was using the end of the craps table to support my lurched posture.) We also made friends, at different points, with a guy we called “Shark” for his Greg Norman shirt, “Nebraska” for his “Nebraska” shirt, and a man named Mel--Mel clearly was big-game hunting, since he started with $500 in chips. Page 3 of 3 - The giant and I both fancied one of the dealers, “Amber,” (name changed to protect the naughty), who looked like Michelle Pfeiffer in “Batman: Returns,” and had a mischievous side just short of Pfeiffer’s “Catwoman” in that film. We both kept up a rat-tat-tat flirty dialogue with her, although he, married, was doing it more to charm a comped buffet out of her. During one of my rolls, I asked for some positive reinforcement from the table, and she began to oblige me with increasingly overt double entendres, all done in a breathy, Kathleen Turner-esque voice. At one point, I exclaimed, “I don’t know whether to roll the dice or light a cigarette!” Eventually, her shift ended, and she was departing. My vertically-fortunate friend told me I should chase her down, and ask her to dinner or drinks, and I wish I could tell you this has a romantic happy ending and we’re getting married next week, but, alas, I still had chips on the table, and I had a feeling the dice were due to get hot. She could’ve been future ex-Mrs. Ryan Anderson material, but we’ll never know. Life is all about timing, and, once again, my timing was poor. Eventually, my cloud-scraping buddy procured his buffet, went to have dinner, and was stunned to come back 90 minutes later and see I was still in the same spot! I think I may have set some sort of endurance record. Maybe there’s a plaque there in my honor?
