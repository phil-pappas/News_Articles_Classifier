This is exactly what Lake Erie North Shore and Pelee Island is about. But you need to know where to go.\nArrive late morning at Iron Kettle B&B and drop your overnight bags. This restored Victorian home from 1876 offers five private rooms with ensuites and an in-house chef with a Michelin-starred track record eager to a cook five-course dinner to suit your tastes. The risotto is excellent. The dinner, overnight stay, and breakfast is $225 for you and a guest—not much more than dinner with wine at the The Keg in Toronto.\nAfter freshening up, head south for lunch at Oxley Estate Winery. Order the fresh water yellow perch, a local specialty. The delicate fish is breaded, fried and served with homemade tartar sauce, hand-cut fries and coleslaw. Perfect with a glass of 2014 Wowza White, which is racy, dry and rips citric zip.\nAfter lunch, sample a few other wines at the tasting bar. The electric 2103 Riesling and cherry-beetroot-scented 2013 Pinot Noir are both generously fruited, seamless and resonant. Buy a few bottles to take with you; local treasures make such great gifts.\nNext, visit Muscedere Vineyards — pronounced moo-SHED-er-ray. Taste the dark and lovely 2012 Pinot Noir — all cranberry, chocolate, violet and herbs — which is almost certainly one of best wines being produced in the region today. Also sample the crushed velvet 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon, which is saturated and savory, as well as the 2011 Meritage, a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc with a mesmerizing effect. Buy a bottle; you’ll want to uncork one with dinner that night.\nHead back to Iron Kettle B&B. Have a dip in the outdoor pool and hot tub. Then, let Chef Ben Leblanc cook for you; you may recognize him from his appearance on the Food Network’s Chopped Canada . Five courses, paired with a bottle from Muscedere Vineyards. Perfection.\nAfter breakfast, pack up and drive to Pelee Island Winery, which feels both polished and welcoming. The charm of this winery: It has the largest selection of delicious and consistent sub-$15 bottles in Ontario. And happily, many of its labels are widely available at the LCBO. Discover some new go-to bottles. Don’t miss the 2013 Pelee Island Unoaked Chardonnay VQA with its lashings of citrus and stone fruit shot through with refreshing acidity. The expressive 2013 Lighthouse Cabernet Franc VQA and elegant 2012 Pelee Island Pinot Noir VQA is a winner.\nThe Pelee Island Winery’s one-hour tour ($5) includes a stroll through the barrel cellar and tank room, a look at the bottling line, and a structured tasting, and is worth your time. Consider taking that tour before driving back to Muscedere Vineyards for one of their riveting reds and a wood-fired pizza on their patio before heading home.\nThe cost of visits to wineries, restaurants and lodgings were covered by Wine Country Ontario.\nCarolyn Evans Hammond is a Toronto-based wine writer, a London-trained sommelier and author.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T07:18:08.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
