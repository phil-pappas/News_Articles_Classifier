Professor Tuomisto, 36, has a background in material physics and researching the structure of materials at their atomic level. As a professor, one of his key areas of research is examination and prediction of the resistance to radiation of the energy materials. He is also the head of the Positron Physics research group. EspooAmbassador programme produces visible results Seven years ago, in 2009, City of Espoo together with Visit Espoo launched the EspooAmbassador programme in order to win more international conferences to Espoo. The goal is to encourage all scientists in Espoo to invite and host conferences from their own field of research expertise. The Espoo City Mayor Jukka Mäkelä is delighted to see the results, saying “Espoo has constantly increased the number of conferences held in the city and we have maintained our position as the second most popular destination for conferences in Finland after capital Helsinki. Conferences make innovations visible and is one of the best ways to show our expertise and vast knowledge here in Espoo Innovation Garden to the world.” Visit Espoo together with the City of Espoo annually chooses and awards the Ambassador of the year. The award is announced in annual EspooAmbassador event, hosted by the Mayor of Espoo and Aalto University. Wide range of representatives from scientific institutions are invited in this event.
