We refer, of course, to the European Union itself. The central administration of the EU continues to spend the money of its hard-pressed taxpayers with gay abandon, some of it in order to foster a belief among the credulous and the young that it is careful with our money. As we disclosed on Monday , the Publications Office of the European Union has produced a series of cartoon strips, games and colouring books for children to counter the impression that the 28-member bloc is wasteful. Senior British sources disclosed that the UK has told the French that the commemoration services “should not be about EU politics” Photo: Alamy EU Flag (Alamy) Now comes research from the eurosceptic organisation Business for Britain (BfB) showing how the EU spends some £500 million a year on promoting itself through its various publicity and communication outlets. That is just the direct spending: most EU budgets also have provision for spending to be made on “project-enhancing awareness of Union policies” and “corporate communication of the political priorities of the Union”. This pushes the total spending to more than £3 billion , a sum £1 billion higher than in a 2008 study made using the same methodology. Since then, financial markets have collapsed and countries including Greece, Spain and Ireland have been forced to slash public spending. In the view of BfB, much of this exercise is propaganda seeking to “improve public perceptions of the Union”. Such spending is an insult to Europe’s millions of unemployed young people. Moreover, an organisation that feels the need to bang its own drum so loudly simply wants to drown out criticism. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:01:40.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
