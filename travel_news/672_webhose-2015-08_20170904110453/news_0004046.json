Its $6.6 billion brand value makes it both the region’s most valuable brand and the world’s most valuable airline. Its extensive sports sponsorship and global route network make it recognised the world over. However, it is Emirates’ exceptional service and reliability that truly underpin the brand,” Brand Finance CEO David Haigh had said earlier this year. \nEmirates airline has grown from its early days in 1985, when it launched with just two aircraft, to its current status as one of the world’s fastest growing airlines with 2108 wide-body aircraft including the world’s largest fleet of Boeing 777s and A380s (as of end-2014). \nIn 2012, the airline launched a new global brand platform and direction, themed 'Hello Tomorrow,' which positioned the global airline as the enabler of global connectivity and meaningful experiences. \nThe airline’s hiring of a Hollywood star’s services comes close on the heels of its UAE peer Etihad hiring Nicole Kidman in March this year. Kidman is both star and narrator of the captivating feature, which runs on global TV stations and social media in both 60 and 30-second formats, with still versions of the campaign appearing in print, digital and on outdoor channels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:24.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
