Published on : Friday, August 14, 2015\nEdinburgh Airport continues to grow after another recording breaking month. More than 1.2 million passengers have travelled through its terminal in July 2015, breaking previous records set last summer.\nAfter a busy month, a total of 1,214,633 have passed through the airport in July. This is a phenomenal achievement but it hasn’t come easily. Gordon Dewar, Chief Executive of Edinburgh Airport said: “Our teams have worked hard to help passengers on their journey and we’re continuing to work hard to give our passengers the service they expect.\n“It was only two years ago, we broke our first million passenger month and now in our peak we’ve grown by 20%. This is really pleasing, but it’s clear we’re going to have to invest further for next year as we anticipate more growth.”\nThe July passenger figure is a 10.3% increase on July 2014. International passengers rose by 10.2% and domestic passengers by 10.6% on the same period last year. Last month also saw the airport manage the players and increased passengers attending The British Open.\nThe increase in domestic travel was driven by Ryanair’s new Stansted service now flying up to three times per day; Flybe’s new service to London City now flying up to six times per day; BA Cityflyer’s increased services to London City; and strong easyJet Bristol and Belfast performances.\nInternational traffic was up due to higher than anticipated load factors across the network, particularly Ryanair and easyJet. Also more passengers were flying on Ryanair to Dublin, Brussels Charlois and Gdansk. easyJet have an additional A320 serving key European routes during the summer peak and Norwegian’s Malaga service has also performed well. Longhaul passenger numbers were up, with higher than anticipated load factors on Etihad and United services.\nGordon Dewar continued: “June and July have seen over a million passengers each month. We’re predicting August will be good for us too, it’s is always an exciting month in Edinburgh with more people visiting Edinburgh for the big festivals.”\n2015 2014 Change Domestic 488,390 441,649 +10.6% International 726,243 659,312 +10.2% Total 1,214,633 1,100,961 +10.3%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:03:49.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
