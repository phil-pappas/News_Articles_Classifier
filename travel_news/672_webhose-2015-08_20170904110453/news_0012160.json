Considering these benefits, Tourism New Zealand has created four sketches of iconic New Zealand locations from the new 100% Pure brand campaign.\nWith colouring-in fast becoming a popular pastime for adults to relieve stress and increase mindfulness, the colour sketches allow adults to unleash their creativity whilst planning their next adventure to New Zealand.\nTourism New Zealand collaborated with New Zealand artist, Gabby Malpas to re-create four evocative destinations sketches using line art. The North and South Island images reflect those featured in the latest brand campaign and include a couple exploring Waiheke Island, Hobbiton™ Movie Set, Milford Sound and Cathedral Cove.\nGabby Malpas was born and raised in Auckland and is now based Sydney where she infuses New Zealand and Pacifica culture into her work. Gabby said she is honoured to be taking destination storytelling to a new level for a place that’s close to her heart.\nTourism New Zealand collaborated with New Zealand artist, Gabby Malpas to re-create four evocative destinations sketches using line art.“I feel privileged to recreate stunning New Zealand landscapes and really encourage people to bring these to life through their own creativity. The trend of adult colouring-in is taking the world by storm and I love that it encourages people to get back in touch with their artistic side whilst finding calmness along the way.”\n“New Zealand will always be my home and I drew deeply upon its uniqueness when sketching the line drawings. As people colour in the lines, I hope they will be inspired by the North and South Island’s beauty,” Ms Malpas said.\nTourism New Zealand General Manager, Australia, Tony Saunders says it’s a holiday for the mind.”\n“It’s exciting to offer people a new way to experience New Zealand – especially as we’re the first National Tourism Board in the world to showcase our landscapes through colouring-in. New Zealand has such a rich story; we chose the four locations as they each present a different adventure and are all easily accessible from Australia. Whether it is sipping wine at a vineyard on Waiheke Island or jumping in a kayak to explore the wonders of Milford Sound, New Zealand has something for everyone.”\nArtist Gabby Malpas makes a start colouring-in one of her sketches. Pictured is a scene from Cathedral Cove on the Coromandel Peninsula.“Colour Your Journey is a great way to hero our new brand campaign, which marks a fresh chapter for 100% Pure New Zealand,” Mr Saunders said. Colouring-in books for adults have shot to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list with five of the top 20 best-selling books being colouring-in titles.\nTourism New Zealand’s latest brand TVC which inspired the line art illustrations can be found here. People are encouraged to use #colouryourjourney #NZMustDo and @purenewzealand to share their colouring-in creations on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:16:42.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
