IJL taking place over three days from 6 to 8 September marks its Diamond Jubilee this year and 60 years as the leading dedicated UK jewellery trade event. Olympia London celebrates 130 years as the UK’s most pre-eminent venue since foundations were laid by the Earl of Zetland in 1885. \nThe 60th anniversary event will be celebrated with some sparkling 60th anniversary prizes, which visitors can enter to win by registering online at www.jewellerylondon.com/register. A special commemorative video depicting the show over the years will also be unveiled to mark the occasion. This year’s event is also set to be one of the most dazzling yet, with 100 new designers and companies exhibiting. Olympia Grand was the very first of Olympia London’s seven spaces to be built and this year represents the 130th year since planning began. The date is enshrined on a foundation stone marked 21 July 1885 in Olympia Grand’s foyer. The creation of new venues and spaces has continued right through the 21st century, with the most recent space Olympia West opening in 2013. Jazmin Beale Head of Marketing and Communications said: “We’re delighted to be sharing a birthday with International Jewellery London, which has shone for 60 years as the pre-eminent event for the jewellery industry. IJL will be celebrating this in a unique setting, Olympia London, which formally began build 130 years ago. We’ll be toasting to another 130 years of events!” Sam Willoughby, Event Director commented: “The dazzling and elegant glass roof at Olympia will create the perfect atmosphere for our Diamond Jubilee celebrations. We are looking forward to welcoming all the major jewellery brands and companies from across the world for a spectacular sixtieth year show.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T13:35:15.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
