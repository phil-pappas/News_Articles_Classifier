We selected the schools based on their close vicinity and access to golf courses. It is great to see so many schools interested to be part of the program and we are confident their students will enjoy the My Golf Program bring brought to their schools.”, said Natalie Ritter, General Manager for the Fiji International.\nThe Fiji International School program includes 4 visits to each school inclusive of three thirty-minute sessions with different age groups of primary school students. The Fiji International School program is aiming to reach over 2,000 primary school students in Fiji and leave behind a legacy in golf as well as a platform which is self sustainable for future development.\nAdditional activities to further enhance the golf experience at these schools has been developed including a “Design the Fiji International Junior Golf Mascot” competition.

As the golf industry in Fiji grows, so will employment in the industry so it would be good to have more interest in the market place around the sport. This program would not be made possible without the Royal and Ancient (St. Andrews) in partnership with Fiji Professional Golf Association and the National Golf Association of Fiji who have worked collaboratively to develop and execute a nationwide golf development program in Fiji. We look forward to continuing the joint efforts for the long term sustainability and growth of golf in Fiji. ” Added Ms. Ritter.\nThe Fiji International School Golf program will run from August to November this year and there is room for three more schools to join the program.
