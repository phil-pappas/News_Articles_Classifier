'You can't have dead whales being the only thing seen by people who spend money on whale-watching.'\nAn American tourist and his group spotted an Icelandic hunting vessel dragging dead whales to port during what should've been an enjoyable whale-watching outing\nTimothy, though disturbed, made a quick-thinking decision to take photos of the grim spectacle - and inform various animal rights organisations of the incident.\nAs a result, the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) are now all calling on Iceland's Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture to immediately rescind all whaling quotas.\n Inside the former Soviet ship used to spy on the UK and US... Bloomin' lovely! Photographer captures playful polar bears... Now THIS is a tight squeeze: The tiny green island ruled by... Is nothing sacred? Hotels reveal that light-fingered Brits... As it stands, Iceland's quotas on the number of whales killed are self-allocated and not approved by the International Whaling Commission.\nTo date, 28 minkes and 91 endangered fin whales have been killed during the 2015 season.\nVarious animal rights and conservation organisations are now calling on Iceland's Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture to rescind whaling quotas, which are currently self-allocated\nA premiere nature tourism destination, Iceland's whale-watching industry has been steadily growing since its inception in 1991.\nToday, it's believed that as many as a quarter of all tourists visiting the country head out on a whale-watching expedition while visiting.\nIn 2014 alone, more than 118,000 people took a whale-watch tour out of Reykjavik, generating more than £4.5million.\nHowever, representatives of Iceland's minke and fin whale industries downplay any potential negative impact on tourism, though a recent poll indicates that almost 90 per cent of UK and German tourists would be unlikely to take a whale-watching trip in Iceland if there was a possibility of seeing whales being killed or transported back to shore.\nA premiere nature tourism destination, many tourists come to Iceland in hopes of spotting a minke whale off the coast of Reykjavik\n'Iceland is an amazing country, with unique vistas and incredible wildlife', said Susan Millward, executive director of AWI. 'It is a shame that its image is being tarnished by cruel commercial hunts for minke and endangered fin whales and by exports of whale products'.\nClare Perry, team leader of EIA's Oceans Campaign, said: 'It's absurd that the whaling activities of just one man and his company – conducted with utter disregard for world opinion and financial reality – are profoundly tainting Iceland's reputation as a tourist destination. People want to see these majestic creatures in their natural element, not dead in the water'.\n'How can a cruel and unnecessary activity such as whaling be allowed to sabotage Iceland's thriving whale-watching businesses when the latter industry contributes over US$7 million to the Icelandic economy, while the latest figures show that whaling makes a US$7.5 million loss?', said Chris Butler-Stroud, chief executive officer of WDC.\nMailOnline Travel has contacted Iceland's Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture for comment.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MIeEpP"], "published": "2015-08-21T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:31:52.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
