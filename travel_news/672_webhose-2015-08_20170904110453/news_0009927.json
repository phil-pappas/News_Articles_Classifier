The Disney Dream that is. Five days aboard a floating fantasy land off the coast of Florida in the company of a host of famous shipmates led by that inevitable mouse.\nAnd it proved to be the perfect Little Maiden voyage for this nautical novice.\nFor any diehard Magic Kingdom fan, there’s no better way to dip your toe in the ocean of cruise holidays out there – because you’ll never be bored aboard the Disney Dream.\nOur Ahoy Story began on arrival at Orlando airport where Disney’s Magical Express coaches were waiting to whisk us to the Disney Yacht Club – a stunning nautical New England themed hotel – hotel for a relaxing pre-cruise stay.\nThen we boarded the ship at Port Canaveral where every family was personally greeted by Disney staff dressed as sailors. The ship’s foghorn even played the opening notes of When You Wish Upon a Star.\nFor the first few hours you get to tour the entire Disney Dream before parts of it go off limits as there are designated adult and child-only areas. And we soon realised the liner – big enough for 4,000 guests, was going to be a kids haven with group activity clubs from toddlers to 18-21s.\nAs a newbie, I found the cabins a little smaller than your average hotel room, but there’s so much to do you hardly spent any time in them.\nAs you might expect, the evening entertainment on board has a Disney theme and first up for my group was The Golden Mickeys – a brilliant show which played tribute to all of the classic musical numbers from the movies.\nEach evening we rotated between the restaurants on board - one is Cinderella/Sleeping Beauty themed, one focused on Disney’s animations and the other is an enchanted garden. The staff were of course dressed appropriately and we had the same waiter each night dishing up what proved to be great food.\nCharacter building: The Pirate-themed show\nThere are also two excellent a la carte restaurants – French-themed Remy, with a nod to the film Ratatouille and Palo, an Italian. The extra cost of around £55 and £20 respectively to dine in them is admittedly not cheap, but it was worth it to escape the crowds and sample some seriously high end cuisine.\nDay two saw us docked at Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas. Once ashore, we wandered around and took in the sights, including an interesting old colonial fort.\nThe Dream offers tours of the island of New Providence, as well as other activities such as swimming with dolphins. We opted to visit the island’s pristine white beaches and watched a band play traditional Bahamian music before heading back on board. Day three proved that, even with all its magic, Disney cannot control the weather.\nWe were due to visit Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island in the Atlantic coral archipelago. But a strong wind blew up and decided to take the Mickey. The captain made repeated efforts to get the ship anchored safely, but the gusts were too strong so we simply ended up floating by this beautiful island.\nAnd we made the most of being ‘trapped’ on a luxury cruise ship in the subtropical winter sunshine by lounging next to the pool and visiting the spa for beauty treatments and a relaxing sauna.\nWe could have watched a movie or joined in animation workshops and cocktail classes or listened to a talk on nutrition. And there’s a gym with a vast array of fitness machines to burn off those calories.\nThrills: On the AquaDuck flume\nThe penultimate evening was designated Pirate Night and we were treated to an incredible outdoor Pirates of the Caribbean themed show with an impressive fireworks display (Disney is one of the few cruise lines allowed to have fireworks at sea).\nAll the main restaurants join in the pirate theme, serving ‘avast’ range of delicious Caribbean dishes.\nThe last full day on board was spent riding the exhilarating 765ft long AquaDuck flume (it’s see-through and sticks out over the side of the ship, so it’s not for the faint hearted) and soaking ourselves in the hot tubs (they are also suspended over the side and have a glass floor). And so, next day, my nautical newbie voyage was over.\nAfter docking back at Port Canaveral there was time for a few hours at the Magic Kingdom in Orlando before heading home with the feeling that the Disney Dream had certainly given me a taste for cruising.\nGet there Walt Disney Travel Co has a 4nt Bahamas cruise on Disney Dream sailing from Port Canaveral, Florida, on May 2 to Nassau and Disney’s Castaway Cay in the Bahamas from £1,064pp, based on four sharing with Virgin Atlantic flights from Gatwick and a 1nt hotel stay.
