Similar laws exist in Australia, which has designated parts of Iraq and Syria as no-travel zones. \nWhen asked about the ramifications of his proposed anti-terror measure, Harper struck a defiant tone. \nHe acknowledged – grudgingly – that humanitarian workers, journalists and diplomats might “theoretically” have legitimate reasons for travelling to such a country. \n“There will be exceptions in the law for those legitimate reasons, and I don’t think that people who have legitimate reasons will have difficulty showing those, but we know what other people are doing there,” Harper said. \n“That is something that we have to nip in the bud before trained terrorists return to this country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:25.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
