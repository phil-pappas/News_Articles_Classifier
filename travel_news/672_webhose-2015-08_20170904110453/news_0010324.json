In Australia’s ruggedly beautiful Northern Territory there are two core components to a memorable meal: a spectacular setting and great food and drink. Whether you’re tucking into oysters over a waterfront sunset in Darwin or sipping champagne under the desert stars of Uluru, the region lays on an enormous range of dramatic dining experiences. This is a land where national parks such as Kakadu stretch out to red horizons, crossing plains, forests, cliffs and wetlands. It’s a land thick with Aboriginal heritage and big on adventure. Expect age-old rock escarpments rather than busy beach resorts. They do things differently here. Darwin’s proximity to Asia has given the capital a hugely multicultural population, and at its palm-lined beach markets you’ll find everything from Sri Lankan curries and Indonesian satay sticks to Vietnamese noodles and Greek souvlaki. Harbourside dining spots such as Cullen Bay Marina and the gleaming new Waterfront District combine elegant mod-Oz restaurants with craft beer pubs and Aussie wine bars. The seafood found off the coast are famed for their freshness and flavour, and specialities such as barramundi, mud crabs and prawns are a must Local produce plays a big role. The seafood found in the waters off the coast are famed for their freshness and flavour, making specialities such as barramundi, mud crabs and prawns a must. Meat-eaters are similarly well catered for, not only because of the excellent beef steaks but also thanks to exotic cuts such as kangaroo, camel and crocodile. When you factor in the tropical fruit and the high-quality wines readily available from across the country, the Northern Territory makes a superb food destination. The backdrops you’ll encounter are every bit as special as the produce. Imagine a beef ’n’ barra barbecue at a remote outback retreat such as Daly Waters Historic Pub. Or wagyu tenderloin and a vintage shiraz at the alfresco Under The Desert Moon experience at Kings Canyon. Or a sunrise breakfast of freshly baked wild berry and wattleseed muffins at deluxe wilderness bolthole Bamurru Plains. Alongside the unforgettable meals and awe-inspiring settings, the region’s characters themselves leave a lasting impression. Whether it’s indigenous chef Bob Taylor, who transfers guests from Alice Springs to scenic Simpsons Gap for stargazing at a traditional camp-oven dinner, or Seona Moss, the Aussie chef who takes inspiration from the desert to create fine dining at Uluru’s luxury Longitude 131 retreat, in this part of the country culinary passions run high. Given the Northern Territory’s timeless beauty it’s little surprise that people feel so strongly about the place. Why not take a trip and discover it for yourself?
