One. Size : 23 x 36 x 56 cm Weight : 10 kg. In Upper Class (business/first cabin), passengers may take two bags, weighing up to 16kg. Can I book a hold bag on a single leg, and travel hand-luggage only on the other? No. Virgin Atlantic says that hold baggage is included in your ticket, so if passengers book a return, they are entitled to baggage in both directions. If you don’t have anything to check in on one leg, then you don’t pay any less. Am I allowed any items in addition to my one cabin bag ? In addition to the cabin baggage allowances as above, Virgin Atlantic passengers may bring a handbag or pocket bag \"as you would normally use it\". The airline says this means that it should not be used to carry items that would otherwise go in the cabin bag. Passengers may also bring an overcoat, an umbrella or walking stick, a small camera and/or pair of binoculars, a \"reasonable amount\" of reading matter for the flight, a \"small amount\" of duty free goods, and headphones for using the in-flight entertainment system.

Passengers cannot carry a garment bag as cabin baggage unless it falls within the dimension restrictions.
