These initial tenants will be located on approximately eight acres of land in Titletown. Future development on the remaining 16 acres calls for additional commercial and retail elements, as well as a residential component.\n\"We're very excited to share our vision for the Titletown District,\" Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said. \"The public plaza, with its size and location near Lambeau Field, will be a draw that is unique in our area and a wonderful public space for our community.\n\"Kohler Co., Bellin Health and Hinterland are three great Wisconsin organizations providing exceptional service in their respective areas. We're thrilled they will be a part of Titletown. They each will bring more visitors to the area, serve our current residents and add to the draw for our community as a whole.\"\nTargeted completion is set for Fall 2017 for all initial components. Groundbreaking is anticipated for this fall with infrastructure and utilities serving as the first work on the area, land that stretches west along Lombardi Avenue from Ridge Road to Marlee Lane.\nIn addition to further planning and design by each of the three tenants for their facilities, the Packers will hold focus groups in the coming weeks with community stakeholders to determine the desired programming and activities for the public plaza.\nThe Packers will invest approximately $65 million in Titletown, with a cumulative initial investment by all parties to be between $120-130 million .\nKohler Co. will construct and operate LODGE KOHLER , a proposed Four-Diamond hotel within Titletown on Ridge Road.
