Madden told Louisville Business First this week that he originally wanted to open the Aloft before the 2016 Kentucky Derby in order to take advantage of the crowd that will descend upon Louisville. The more realistic date, he said, likely would be sometime in June, but he is not giving up on those Derby aspirations just yet. \"Maybe we can catch up,\" he said. \"Maybe we’ll have a whole bunch of great weather.\" Madden, who transformed his family's Hamburg Place farm in Lexington into the sprawling Hamburg Pavilion mixed-use shopping and residential development and developed the Kohl's department store on Bardstown Road in Louisville, said a decision on an opening date will have to be made about six months in advance in order to allow time for reservations. A building permit for the five-story hotel started was issued earlier this month and it was reported by WDRB-TV in June that initial construction had started. D.W. Wilburn Inc. is the general contractor on the project, and EOP Architects is the architectural firm. Both companies are based in Lexington. Once completed, 70,350-square-foot Aloft, which is estimated at $20 million, will have a number of amenities, including an indoor bar and restaurant area, wireless Internet and other technology capabilities, an outdoor park and bar area and conference room space. Guests also will have have access to nearby walking trails, Madden said. Bobby Morris, project manager for EOP Architects, said the 126 guest rooms will include four suites with king-sized beds, 46 standard rooms with two queen-sized beds and 76 standard rooms with king-sized beds. The hotel, Morris added, will have 65 full- and part-time employees. Aloft, which has more than 75 hotels in 14 countries, is a flag of Stamford, Conn.-based Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (NYSE: HOT). Another Aloft hotel is under construction at the corner of First and Main streets in downtown Louisville. \nGet Louisville  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T22:29:03.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
