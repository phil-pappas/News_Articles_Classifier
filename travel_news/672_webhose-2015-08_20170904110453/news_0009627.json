The fault runs just at the bottom of the hillside beyond the water. \nSituated between I-5 and US Hwy 101, the Carrizo Plain is one of California's least-visited sights, with many state residents unaware of its existence. Yet nearly everyone has seen the classic image of the San Andreas Fault taken from the air that's shown as the first page of this gallery - and it was taken directly above the Carrizo Plain. \nGeologists swoon over this bit of California geology. Besides the dramatic fault itself, a bird's-eye view reveals streams beds offset by the fault's movement, hills torn apart in the middle and sagging bits of the earth's surface, but they're more subtle and harder to see on the ground. Nevertheless, the area is extraordinarily beautiful, especially during a good wildflower year and much is accessible by family sedan. The free self-guided geologic tour brochure available at the Visitor Center will help you get the most out of your visit. Written for laymen, it includes a hike to a point atop the fault. You can also download self-guided podcasts and tour brochures . \nThe Carrizo Plain is halfway between US Hwy 101 and I-5, accessible from either side. It's closer to Los Angeles than to San Francisco, but you can visit in a long day trip from either city. \nThe Carrizo Plain website warns not to rely on GPS systems or online mapping sites for directions because they'll get you lost, but it's easy to get there: Exit I-5 at CA Hwy 58 west near Buttonwillow, continue west through McKittrick and turn left onto Soda Lake Road or exit US Hwy 101 at CA Hwy 58 east near Santa Margarita, travel east and turn right onto Soda Lake Road. Soda Lake Road is paved from the north end to the visitor's center. It's also possible to get there from the south via CA Hwy 166 and Soda Lake Road north, but you'll drive on an unpaved, dirt road for 20 miles to reach the visitor center. \nCarrizo Plain is very isolated, with no place to get food, water or gasoline for many miles in any direction. It's very hot and inhospitable in summer and the visitor center is only open from the beginning of December to the end of May. And to top it all off - there's no cellphone reception in the area, either. It's up to you to be prepared. \nThis area is also popular with birders and photographers. Following a rainy winter, wildflower displays are some of the state's best and docents lead special tours to see them. The nearest lodging is along the major highways, but they do have a campground.
