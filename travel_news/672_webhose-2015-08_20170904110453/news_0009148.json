It also runs restaurants and tourist attractions, and owns virtually all tourist-related enterprises in Catalina’s resort town of Two Harbor.\nThere are other tourism operators on the island, but SCICo is the largest.\nThe company was founded by William, Joseph and Hancock Banning, the sons of Phineas Banning — widely known as the father of the Port of Los Angeles — in 1891. William Wrigley Jr., who is best known for chewing gum brands that include Juicy Fruit and Doublemint, and for owning the Chicago Cubs from 1921 until his death 11 years later, bought a controlling interest in SCICo in 1919.\nWrigley spent millions of dollars renovating the island, adding public utilities, a hotel, extensive landscaping and the iconic Catalina Casino.\nToday’s modern iteration of the company that Wrigley created is once again building up the island. It has already spent $55 million on projects, and it plans to spend at least $55 million more on other ones, including more island activities such as an aerial adventure park, according to SCICo chief executive Randy Herrel.\nSpa\nOne of the most recent, and biggest, changes to the island was the addition of Island Spa Catalina, which opened in November.\n“It’s the first and only resort-style spa on the island. We offer an experience. You can’t get one like this anywhere else,” said spa manager Ashley Seward.\nThe spa’s nine treatment rooms — including four massage rooms, a couple’s room and two waxing and skin-care rooms — are named after spots on the island such as El Encanto.\nBeach Club\nDave Stevenson, SCICo’s vice president of sales and marketing, said the new Descanso Beach Club will attract additional visitors and corporate retreats to the island, which “stretches the season out” beyond the normal Memorial Day-to-Labor Day time period.\nThe club, which opened in January, has a ballroom that can be divided into two sections and fits 150 to 200 people. It also has a terrace overlooking the ocean and an outdoor gazebo.\nRestaurants\nFood and restaurants have been a big part of SCICo’s effort to attract more visitors.\nMatthew Alleshouse, who started in July as the executive chef of all the company’s restaurants, is focusing on fresh products and favorite island items such as seafood, burgers, wings, ahi tuna salads and fish sandwiches.\n“The food is driven from a local standpoint. We do a lot of sustainable products. We work with a lot of farmers,” he said.\nAlleshouse is also helming “Catalina’s only made-from-scratch ice cream parlor,” Descanso Fresh. But not all of the ice cream flavors are the ones you remember from growing up.\n“We’ve developed quite a few 21 and up ice creams,” he said. Some even have 30 percent alcohol content.\nA scoop of ice cream will run you $3.75 and a 16-ounce milkshake will cost $6.50.\nOne signature flavor is Buffalo Milk, named after the island’s famous Buffalo Milk cocktail.\nThe drink, a coffee banana milkshake with a kick, can be enjoyed on the beach; Catalina has one of the only public beaches in California where you can drink legally, Stevenson said.\nHotels\nSCICo has three hotels in the city of Avalon: the Pavilion Hotel, The Inn on Mt Ada and Hotel Atwater.\nMt Ada is “uber luxe,” Pavilion is a beach boutique hotel, and Atwater is a value hotel, Stevenson said.\nThe Pavilion, which is in the center of town, has rooms that vary from $155 in the off-season to as much as $950 at peak times, said Roberto Perico, general manager of hotels for the company.\nIn the summer, occupancy is at 95 percent, and during the winter it is 75 percent to 80 percent full.\nRenovations are underway at the roughly 100-room Atwater. The company also sees room for improvement to Catalina’s historic Inn on Mt Ada, which was originally the Wrigley family’s home.\nThe six-bedroom hotel is so popular that it gets completely booked an entire year in advance.\nStevenson said a second building on the property, which was once staff quarters, will be turned into four to six additional bedrooms.\nDrought\nWater is an issue on the island. Herrel said the company is using half the water it used in 2012 and 2013, despite a 30 percent increase in business, saving roughly 4.5 million gallons a year.\nRestaurants cook with jugs of water. Hotels send laundry to the mainland, ask guests to reuse sheets and towels, and have installed water-efficient showerheads and faucets.\nDishwashers are one of the biggest water guzzlers on the island, but SCICo has plans to use jugs of water for washing dishes, too.\nIt uses smart water and drip irrigation systems for landscaping, and irrigates the golf course with nonpotable water.\nThe future\nSCICo has more plans. One goal is to add year-round activities that don’t involve the beach.\nHerrel wants to energize the casino building to include movies and a film on the island’s history, and to add an aerial adventure park where people can climb on ropes between trees and across the canyon.\nThere is also a winery on the island that the company wants to open to the public.\nHannah Madans,\nOrange County Register", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:13:25.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
