This is how it's done and it's actually a very problem child in the beginning.'\nNow that Monti has been moved to his new enclosure he will embark upon an independent life, which will involve him eating carrots and cucumber by himself and living alongside other wallabies.\nMonti was moved to his new enclosure in Berlin and will embark upon an independent life alongside the other wallabies\nTierpark Berlin was founded in 1955 and is one of two zoos located in the German capital.\nIt hosts more than 7,000 exotic animals, in 160 hectares (400 acres) in the former grounds of the Friedrichsfelde Palace.\nAs well as wallabies, the zoo is also home to a large number of lions, elephants and rhinos.\nTierpark Berlin is on the former grounds of the Friedrichsfelde Palace and is one of two zoos located in the German capital", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1IkwtHa"], "published": "2015-08-05T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T22:28:08.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
