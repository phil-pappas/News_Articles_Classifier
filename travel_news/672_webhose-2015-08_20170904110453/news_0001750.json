Insolvency firm Sharma & Co then placed the company into creditors’ voluntary liquidation. \nThe message was updated last week to say a rescue package was being worked on with an update due last Thursday. It then said the update would be given on Monday, but at the time of going to press, no new statement had been made. \nStaff at Sharma & Co refused to speak to TTG regarding the issue. \nThe Daily Mail reported that some families arrived in resort last month only to find they could not stay in accommodation booked and paid for. \nDocuments at Companies House list Sebastian Orr as director of International Villas Ltd, but this firm was dissolved last September after a failure to file accounts. Orr is also director of IVL Ltd, which was set up in 2007 and is still trading. It filed its accounts on September 19, 2014. The company has no Atol licence. \nAlan Bowen, legal adviser to the Association of Atol Companies, said the problems showed how the industry was being failed by regulators. “It is very strange for a business to fail at the peak of the summer season as that is when cashflow is at its highest,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:19:50.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
