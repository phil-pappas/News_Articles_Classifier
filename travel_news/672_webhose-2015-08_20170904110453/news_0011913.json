I wander down from my hotel above Bonne Bay and make my way to the squat, red and white Woody Point Lighthouse. \nThe sun is peeking through broken, heavy, gun-metal grey clouds, sending waves of light skimming over the dark water. I stand on an outcropping of rock that looks like the Canadian Shield and inhale the sea air and watch a bald eagle soar out toward the Gulf of St. Lawrence. I gaze up to the east at massive, deep headlands cleaved by one of the arms of Bonne Bay, a natural fjord. \nFarther south, behind the lighthouse, I can see Newfoundland and Labrador’s famous tablelands, a massive pile of orange-red rock whose tops are obscured by thick grey clouds. \nI feel almost breathless, partly because I can’t believe the sudden heat and partly because it’s so powerfully beautiful. I gaze out at the water and at the small homes dotting the deep green hills and think back to my first night in the park, when I took in a concert in nearby Rocky Harbour by a hugely popular local band called Anchors Aweigh. \nOne of the songs they played at the show was called “Beautiful Bonne Bay,” with lyrics that talked about the mighty eagles and mystic mountains and glistening waters in the cool moonlight. The music was mostly upbeat, with not only traditional tunes but also a wacky bit where they wedded local lyrics about fishing trawlers to the tune of “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin. \nThey also had their long-time accordion player, the rubber-faced and utterly frantic Reg Lewis, dress up in women’s clothing for a few tunes. \nBand leader Wayne Parsons at one point called Lewis “the best cross-dressing accordion player in the province.” Nobody argued the point. He also suggested audience members get up and stretch their posterior muscles “so your arse don’t get dunched (sore).” Nobody argued that, either. \nThe next night I take in local singer Dave Shears, who mixes in songs about the simple life of “saltwater joys” and also sings a tune partly written by a friend who went off to Ontario to find work and fell dead of a heart attack. Luckily, Shears lightens the mood with “Sloop John B” from the Beach Boys and “Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver. \nBoth the Anchors Aweigh show and Shears’ performance took place at the Ocean View Hotel in the seaside town of Rocky Harbour, an hour or so north of the Deer Lake Airport. It’s a cute town that rises and falls with the coast, a stretch of small craft shops and restaurants lining a winding, two-lane road. \nJust past the town I wander into the parking lot at Lobster Cove Head, where there’s a beautiful lighthouse and a fun museum that spins colourful stories about local fishermen and their families and the last light keeper, George Young, who was forced out of his job after 29 years when the lighthouse was automated and never again set foot in the building. \nThe exhibits are great, but it’s the views that rock me. I wander down some stairs to a beach carved by storms and ceasing waves and wind and ice and admire enormous bits of driftwood and rocks that are worn in such a way that they appear to have a Russian-looking alphabet on them. I walk back up, past tiny green plants clinging with all their might to loose bits of deep brown and black shale, and traipse briefly through a thicket of trees dappled by summer sunlight. I reach another lookout point and admire brilliant blue and green dragon flies darting past gnarly, weather-beaten trees overlooking the Gulf of St. Lawrence. \nThat afternoon I take in a marvellous boat tour on Western Brook Pond, a long, narrow and deep fresh water lake that would be labelled a fjord if it weren’t blocked off from the ocean by a three kilometre stretch of land at one end. It’s one of the most stunning vistas in Canada, with majestic, green-clad mountains rising overhead and spiky white clouds that dance in a powder-blue summer sky. \nThe mountains here have been scoured and scrubbed and scraped some 40 times by glaciers over various ice ages, our tour guides tell us in French and English. My fellow passengers and I stand slack-jawed and silent as we pass craggy, wind-whipped peaks hundreds of metres high and gaze at deep cracks in the rock that plunge to the water. We also spot a half-dozen or more waterfalls, four of them high overhead at the far end. It’s a dreamy setting, but Newfoundlanders like to keep things real. Just as I’m waxing poetic about one of the falls our guide announces that the cataract we’re all admiring is called “Pissing Mare Falls.” \nI also spent a few hours out on Bonne Bay in a seaworthy kayak, courtesy of Gros Morne Adventures. We cut across the bay to the quiet waters under a massive wall of rock, watching a very brave tern dive-bomb a bald eagle and casting our eye down at diaphanous pink jellyfish scooting along in the clear, blue water. One of our guides for the day spots the plume from a Minke whale that’s comes to frolic in the bay. \nParks Canada guide Cedric Davignon is from Quebec but met his future wife here 13 years ago and works at the Gros Morne Visitors Centre in Woody Point. \n“People still love close to the land here. They harvest wood and they pick at the side of the road. It’s a big, open landscape and it’s so pure.” \nThe beauty of Western Brook Pond and Bonne Bay are one of the reasons Gros Morne is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But on a walk on a drizzly day, Davignon tells me one of the main reasons it has earned special status are the tablelands near Woody Point. \n“I tell people that every day of their lives they walk on the earth’s crust. But not today.” \nThe reason is that the tablelands are actually rocks thrust up from the Earth’s oceans some half a billion years ago. It’s a vastly different geography from the surrounding area, with rocks full of iron and other minerals. The iron gets exposed to the elements, which helps create the rusty, orange moonscape. It’s a harsh environment with small jagged rocks that reminds me of Mordor in The Lord of the Rings. I don’t see Gollum or Frodo, but I admire small streamlets of trickling, fresh water and tiny junipers and potentilla plants that look like they came out of a Japanese bonsai garden. \nMargaret Atwood and Bruce Cockburn are in Woody Point for the annual Writers’ Festival, but my last night is set aside for a concert that’s part of the Gros Morne Summer Music series. I take in a show by local singer Mena Lodge, a charming story teller with a clear, lovely voice. She and her band are playing at an event space in Woody Point called St. Pat’s, a former church. \nIt’s a beautiful summer night with an orange and cotton candy pink sunset, but I stay inside as much as possible to listen to a fantastic fiddler (from near Ottawa) and a talented, local accordion player. \nA man dances with his young son at the front of the hall during a particularly joyful number, while women of a certain age hold each other and whirl around the hall during one of the waltzes. As the sun sets outside in shades of orange and cotton candy pink, the band launches into a traditional Newfoundland and Labrador song about the joys of life on The Rock. \n“In a land full of factories and mills, I long for the happiness and the freedom, of my little island house on the hill.” \nIF YOU GO \nSTAY: The Ocean View Hotel Shallow Bay Motel is a waterfront spot with a pool, dinner theatre and an on-site restaurant in Cow Head. The Bonne Bay Inn is a wonderful, boutique property on a hill in Woody Point, with bright colours and Keurig coffee makers in the rooms and big windows in the dining area so you can gaze out at the bay. EAT: Bonne Bay makes tasty crab cakes with a spicy kick and a surprisingly tasty coconut curry soup with sweet potatoes. Justin Thyme in Norris Point serves tasty mussels in a cream sauce with a balsamic glaze. Java Jack’s in Rocky Harbour is a lovely coffee house with good sandwiches and a lovely, community feel. HIKE: In addition to hikes around Western Brook Pond and on the Tablelands, there are great coastal walks north of Lobster Cove Head and near the town of Trout River, south of Woody Point. There’s a great walk to be had at Cow Head, with a pretty meadow studded with rounded rocks kids will love to play on and a cool beach studded with odd-shaped slabs of stone. Check out the brightly painted outhouses in the parking lot, too!
