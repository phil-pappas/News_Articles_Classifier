Picture: TREVOR SAMSON In this article Companies and organisations: African National Congress People: Mmusi Maimane | Ebrahim Patel THE ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could not be blamed for the global storms wreaking havoc with commodity markets and the mining sector, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said in the South African National Assembly on Tuesday.\nMr Patel was responding, during a debate on the growing economic crisis, to an attack by Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane on government’s economic policies.\nMr Maimane said that President Jacob Zuma was to blame for the economic crisis and high levels of unemployment. \"Instead of taking responsibility, the president blames global economic conditions,\" he said.\nMr Maimane rejected the argument that global economic conditions were to blame, saying that the International Monetary Fund, in its World Economic Outlook, projected economic growth of 4.45% over the next two years in emerging and developing markets and 4.75% for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\"In contrast, SA is expected to grow by a meagre 2%, far below the level required to put a dent in the unemployment rate,\" he said. \"The fact of the matter is that the economic crisis we are facing is a direct result of the failure of the ANC government.\"\nMr Patel said other mineral-producing countries, such as Australia, Canada and the US, were experiencing similar declines in production and job losses due to the fall-off in demand by China. About 20,000 mining jobs in Australia were on the line this year, and Canada had lost 19,700 jobs in the resources sector. Some countries were growing faster than SA, but others, such as Germany, France, Argentina, Brazil and Russia, were growing at levels below that of SA, he said.\nWhile growth was not high enough in SA, there had been \"robust\" job creation over the past year: 563,000 new jobs were created with construction and agriculture leading the pack, he said. Government’s infrastructure drive and the country’s exports to Africa were positive for its future growth trajectory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:59:03.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
