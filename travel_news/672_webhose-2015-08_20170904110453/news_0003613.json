The event, which attracted close to 1,500 travel agency members and preferred suppliers, was one of many occasions at the 27th annual Virtuoso Travel Week conference, taking place this week at Bellagio Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.\nHosted by Virtuoso Chairman and CEO Matthew D. Upchurch, and Albert Herrera, Virtuoso’s senior vice president of Global Product Partnerships, the Destination Showcase honored partners that provide exceptional experiences to Virtuoso clients around the world, while simultaneously offering superior expertise to Virtuoso travel advisors.\n“One of the many qualities that truly sets Virtuoso agencies and suppliers apart from the rest is the close connections they forge courtesy of this network,” said Herrera. “These incredible relationships allow our advisors and partners to create inspired experiences tailored specifically for their shared clients. The Destination Showcase Awards are Virtuoso’s opportunity to recognize these outstanding partners for their continued innovation in luxury travel.”\nEach Virtuoso partner category has an elected committee of Virtuoso advisors that selects the nominees for the awards. The network’s travel advisors vote to decide the winners. This year’s Destination Showcase Award contenders received more than 4,500 votes in total.\nThe winners are part of the network’s land experiences program, Virtuoso Destinations & Experiences. It consists of more than 70 tour operators and 150 On-Site in-country specialists in over 140 countries. The fast-growing portfolio features 20,000 tours from 200 land operators.\nSource:-Virtuoso", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:27:11.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
