Kennedy International Airport from Kingston, Jamaica. Law enforcement were called and met the aircraft.”\nThe New York Post says the whole untoward incident began when 61-year-old passenger Jean Ballentine of Brooklyn allegedly tried to get from her window seat to the aisle by climbing over 52-year-old Mary Cannady of Linden.\nTo this, Cannady reacted by pushing Ballentine away who in turn punched Cannady in the face, reports The New York Daily News as per an account of the incident from Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo.\nA good Samaritan tried to intervene when Ballentine lashed out with an eyebrow razor, cutting the man’s elbow.\nAt that point, Cannady got a small can of pepper spray from her pocketbook and squirted the eye-and-skin irritant onto Ballentine, Newsday of Long Island writes quoting Pentangelo. Several passengers were treated for breathing difficulties, Pentangelo tells the Daily News.\nThe flight was coming from Kingston, Jamaica, and had landed at JFK at around 8:45 a.m. ET arriving to the gate when the ruckus broke out.\nThe Post adds “it was unclear how the two women were able to board the plane in Kingston with the bladed instrument and the spray.”\nJetBlue notes to the newspaper that security screenings in Kingston, where the flight originated, are conducted by the Jamaican Civil Aviation Authority.\nAccording to The Associated Press, the women were arrested and now face a variety of charges. Ballentine’s charges include assault and weapons charges while Cannady was arrested for possessing pepper spray, authorities tell AP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:53:06.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
