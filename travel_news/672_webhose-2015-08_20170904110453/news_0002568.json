Norwegian Cruise Line’s (Nasdaq: NCLH) largest ship — Norwegian Epic — will start sailing from Central Florida’s coast in November 2016. Norwegian Epic, which is the fifth-largest cruise ship in the world, will offer seven-day Eastern and Western Caribbean itineraries, as well as three- and four-day cruises to the Bahamas beginning in 2017. “As a regular port of call for Norwegian Cruise Line ships, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to homeport Norwegian Epic and welcome Norwegian Cruise Line guests into our community,” said Port Canaveral CEO John E. Walsh in a prepared statement. “Our focus is to continue to provide the best customer service and facilities for our business partners and their passengers. Our efforts are being rewarded with the largest ships afloat and more itineraries from Port Canaveral.” The Eastern Caribbean itinerary includes visits to Tortola, British Virgin Islands; St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; and Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas. The Western itinerary includes Cozumel, Mexico; George Town, Grand Cayman; Ocho Rios, Jamaica; and Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas. The three- and four-day Bahamas itineraries include Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay in January and March 2017.
