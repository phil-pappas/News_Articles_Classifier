Here, a primer on the UW offense:\nQUARTERBACKS\nJeff Lindquist , jr., 6-3, 245\nK.J. Carta-Samuels , rs-fr., 6-2, 220\nJake Browning , fr., 6-2, 206\nTony Rodriguez , jr., 6-3, 185\nAnthony Berg , jr., 6-2, 214*\nOutlook: It’s a three-man competition for the starting quarterback job, left vacant after 2014 starter Cyler Miles retired from the sport this summer, citing a chronic hip injury. Lindquist, the Mercer Island graduate, has an advantage in that he’s the only QB on the roster with experience, having started the season opener last year at Hawaii. But Petersen said last week at Pac-12 media days it’s a wide-open race. “It always seems like the media kind of thinks we play our cards close to the vest and we kind of know who the (starter) might be, but we really don’t know,” Petersen said. “We don’t. I wish we did.” Carta-Samuels is a dual-threat wild card — and a legitimate threat to win the job. Browning probably has the most upside, and his sensational high school career has generated a lot of hope and hype. Petersen said he would prefer for Rodriguez, a JUCO transfer, to redshirt this season.\n*denotes walk-on\nHusky football opponents preview: Oct. 17 vs. Oregon Ducks Oct. 8 @ USC Trojans Sept. 26 vs. Cal Bears Sept. 19 vs. Utah State Sept. 12 vs. Sacramento State Sept. 4 @ Boise State …\nRUNNING BACKS\nDwayne Washington , jr., 6-2, 226\nLavon Coleman , so., 5-11, 222\nDeontae Cooper , jr., 5-11, 200\nJomon Dotson , r-fr., 5-10, 174\nMyles Gaskin , fr., 5-9, 192\nRalph Kinne , so., 5-10, 214*\nGavin McDaniel , r-fr., 5-8, 188*\nOutlook: I’ve said before that Dwayne Washington might be the most underrated player in the Pac-12. In UW’s updated roster, he’s now listed at 226 pounds — an impressive size for a running back, particularly for one who has clocked a hand-time 4.42-second 40-yard dash. With the uncertainty at QB, it seems likely that the Huskies would again try to rely heavily on the running game (they ran the ball more frequently than anyone in the Pac-12 last season, with mixed results), and it’s fair to expect a big season from Washington. Cooper and Coleman are certainly capable backups, and they should also continue to get quality carries to keep Washington fresh. Dotson was one of the breakout players in the spring and it’ll be interesting to see how he might fit into the offense as a “splash” type player this season.\n…\nDante Pettis celebrates as he returns a punt for a touchdown at Colorado last season.

Mickens is a solid possession receiver and a good team leader; Pettis emerged last fall as a true freshman and should be a top target this season; and Lenius should have a chance to show more of his big-play potential. After that, questions abound. With the lack of depth, Petersen said that at least three of the newcomers — Baccellia, McClatcher, Pounds, Renfro and/or Little — will probably have to play this season. McClatcher seems like a good bet to back up Mickens, and JUCO transfer Little offers intriguing size. One of the walk-ons (Richmond, perhaps) could also emerged in a quality backup role this season, too.\nx-injured; out for the season\n…\nTIGHT ENDS\nJoshua Perkins , sr., 6-4, 226\nDarrell Daniels , jr., 6-4, 241\nDavid Ajamu , so., 6-5, 250\nDrew Sample , r-fr., 6-4, 245\nMike Neal , fr., 6-4, 229\nConnor Griffin , so., 6-4, 235\nOutlook: The Huskies should feel good about what they have here. Perkins and Daniels are essentially co-starters and both figure to be more involved in the passing game this season. We’ve yet to see either of them reach his full potential. The next wave, Ajamu and Sample, are capable contributors; consistency is the key for both entering this season. Neal will almost certainly redshirt, and Griffin — a former walk-on basketball player at Gonzaga — offers intriguing upside.\n…\nSiosifa Tufunga (front) made five starts at guard for UW last fall.

I expect that to change, and perhaps a lot. I’m curious to see what happens with Coleman Shelton , in particular. He’s expected back for the start of fall camp after missing all of spring ball following shoulder surgery, though Petersen said Shelton might be eased slowly back in for the first week or so. O-line coach Chris Strausser hinted in the spring that he was considering Shelton at center (with Tufunga perhaps moving back to guard?), so it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out. Despite losing three regular starters, Petersen said isn’t concerned with the offensive line. “I think we’re going to be fine. We have a lot of guys who played last year for a long time,” he told me last week. The young talent is promising. “In another year,” Petersen said, “we’re going to be really good. … There’s some young talent there. Those guys are going to be good. Now, they’ve got to stay healthy, but it’s what you want to start with.” Petersen has never played a true freshman offensive lineman, and it would seem less than ideal for someone like Adams or Henry to be thrown in this early in their career. Former UW lineman Ben Riva said it’s better for young linemen to sit and learn . “It’s very rare for a kid out of high school to be physically ready to play,” Riva said, “and it’s even more rare for a kid to be mentally ready to play, especially as a lineman, out of high school. … I don’t wish what we had to go through on any other high school kid.”\nAdam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
