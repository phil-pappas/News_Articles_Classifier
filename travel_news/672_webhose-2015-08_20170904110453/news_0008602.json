Just ask the thousands of surfers that call this state home. Surfing: A Short History Surfing didn't become popular in the United States until the 1950s, when the very light fiberglass-covered foam boards were commercially produced. Before that, surfboards were extremely heavy wooden things that required a Charles Atlas-type physique to carry them to the water. Surfing exploded into pop culture with the production of several silver screen movies that spread the “cool” factor of the surfing lifestyle to all corners of the nation, including Florida. Surf shops popped up and the surfing culture was born on the islands and beaches of Florida. Teenagers who previously could not be dragged out of bed before 10 a.m. on weekends were up at dawn to check the surf. Still, surfing was viewed as a sub-culture of youth who refused to conform and it wasn't readily legitimized in mainstream American culture. By the 1970s, when I got involved, surfing had begun to gain popularity as a competitive sport with champions who were promoted and immortalized by surfing magazines and traveling surf movies. Competitors attracted sponsors, which led to product endorsements and commercialization of surfing. If you'd really like to get a fascinating look at the development of surfing in Florida, a stop at the Cocoa Beach Surf Museum is a must. Florida Surf Shops Ron Jon , the most famous surf shop in Florida, has helped make surfing more visible to everyone who comes to this state. With over 50,000 square feet of surfing equipment, beach gear and clothing, all open 24/7, you can't miss it as you drive down A1A through Cocoa Beach . If you aren't near Ron Jon, no problem. Most beach towns have local shops, which are the best source of gear and information on local surf spots. Florida's World-Class Surfers The Eastern Surfing Association is very active in promoting Florida surfing contests that bring surfers together from all over to compete, share ideas and promote surfing-related products. You might think that Florida's relatively small waves would not produce world-class surfers, but you'd be wrong. Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, winner of multiple world championships, and Cory and Shea Lopez of Indian Rocks Beach on the Gulf coast, both winners of many international surfing championships, all honed their wave-ripping skills in the Florida surf. Not to be outdone by the guys, surfing ladies Frieda Zamba of Flagler Beach , and Lisa Andersen of Ormond Beach both hold multiple contest titles and are world surfing champions. And that's just to name a few. Waves in Florida In Florida, weather systems can produce swells that reach our coastline and provide excellent surf. Cold fronts and other wind-causing high or low-pressure weather systems also create surf. Understanding weather patterns is a must for serious surfers. The vastness of the Atlantic Ocean results in more consistent surf and longer swells than is generally found on the relatively calm Gulf beaches. But don't underestimate the possibilities for finding good surf on the Gulf beaches, particularly in northwest and west central Florida. Top Florida Surf Spots You can find surf on most Florida beaches, but certain geographical features, both natural and man-made, create better-than-average waves for surfing. Piers and jetties are by far the most favored locations for surfing. The surf near these structures is usually larger and breaks in a manner more conducive to longer rides. The top spots are best left to the experienced surfers. New and inexperienced surfers will not be accustomed to the powerful waves. Packs of wave-hungry surfers at the top spots sometimes have little patience with beginners, and that can be intimidating. Don’t worry if you are just starting out; there are plenty of spots and plenty of waves for everyone. A few of the top spots around the state are: Northwest Florida", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T05:59:35.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
