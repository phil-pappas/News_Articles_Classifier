This year, we decided to develop a focused theme that would encourage the Malaysian MICE players to collaborate in designing the future course of the industry. Collectively we can prepare a roadmap to build a sustainable industry that is resilient to an ever changing and at times unpredictable global environment. \n“In addition, through the provision of education, networking, exchange of ideas and debate of issues in the three-day event, we hope that the Malaysian business events industry will be better equipped to take ownership of its future.” \nA new feature of MBEW is a by-invite forum for government and industry leaders, which will explore how the public and private sectors can work closely to enhance Malaysia’s status as a preferred MICE destination in Asia. \nMBEW attendees can expect to tap the brains of 20 renowned speakers through plenary sessions, break-out sessions on leadership, sales and marketing and operations, and cluster sessions categorised by the various MICE segments, namely convention, exhibition and incentive. \nKey sessions include Designing a sustainable future by MCI Global’s Guy Bigwood and Roger Simmons; Unlocking The Future Through Creativity by L&R Contract Business Services’ Ruth Lillian; and What the Future Holds – Towards 2020 by Performance Management and Delivery Unit Malaysia’s Idris Jala. \nZulkefli remarked: “The topics are carefully crafted to ensure all MICE segments are covered and are applicable for all levels of the business events (profession), from junior right up to the senior team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T12:38:51.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
