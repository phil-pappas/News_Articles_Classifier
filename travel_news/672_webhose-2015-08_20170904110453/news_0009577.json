Once the deputy fell to the ground, the suspect fired more shots.\nPolice described the suspect as a dark-complexioned male who is believed to be between 20 and 25 years old, and stands about 5-foot-10 to 6-feet tall. He was wearing a white T-shirt and red shorts and driving a red or maroon pickup-style truck with an extended cab. Police said an intensive search for the suspect was ongoing Saturday morning.\nNo motive was determined for the shooting. Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman said Goforth, who was a 10-year veteran of the force, had a wife and two children.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time “In my 45 years in law enforcement, I can’t recall another incident so cold-blooded and cowardly,” Hickman said.\nSheriff’s office spokesman Deputy Thomas Gilliland said Goforth had traveled to the Chevron station where the shooting happened, after earlier responding to a routine car accident.\n“He was pumping gas into his vehicle and the male suspect came up behind him and shot the deputy multiple times,” Gilliland told the Houston Chronicle. “The deputy fell to ground. The suspect came over and shot the deputy again multiple times as he lay on the ground.”\nHe said Goforth died at the scene. Detectives were checking security camera video for possible clues.\n“We are actively searching for suspect right now,” Gilliland said. “I can tell you with diligence and justice the suspect will be caught. And he will be brought to justice … This is a very callous individual.”\nHarris County Sheriff’s deputies and homicide investigators joined officers from other agencies, including the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Houston Police Department, in searching for the suspect.\n“This is a very tough moment right now for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office,” Gilliland said. “Keep us in your prayers and in your thoughts.”\nBob Goerlitz, president of the Harris County Deputies Organization, said the incident was “shocking.”\n“We’ve been warned of things like this, because of public sentiment nationally and events over the last few years … It’s just horrific. That’s the only way to describe it.”\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:37:26.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
