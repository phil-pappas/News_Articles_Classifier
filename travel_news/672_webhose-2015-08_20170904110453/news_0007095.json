We place great importance on creating communications campaigns and projects that expand our young guests’ minds about travel and to enrich their travel experiences. \"Our ‘World’s Most Wonderful Gift’ campaign was inspired from our tradition of naming our new aircraft after the newborn daughters of the Pegasus team members, our Pegasus Family; which was then opened as a competition to Pegasus guests in 2011 and then developed into our new campaign last year when we launched our drawing competition themed ‘Your Dream Holiday’. \"Nine year old Ada Eminağaoğlu from Izmir was chosen as the winner from 7,400 entries by a jury made up of the Pegasus competition winning girls from previous years whose names we had given to our new aircraft. The idea behind our campaign that saw Ada’s ‘Dream Holiday’ themed drawing wrapped around our newest aircraft and be displayed across airports for millions of passengers to see every day, is inspired by the boundless imaginations of our young guests. We are extremely proud to see the response it received by winning at the Stevie International Business Awards, regarded as the Oscars of the PR industry.” The Stevie Awards have been honouring the best in marketing and communications campaigns for 12 years from over 60 countries. The awards jury consists of 200 of the world’s leading businesspeople and academics. The 2015 Awards Ceremony will take place in Toronto, Canada on 23 October.
