The addition of Samasati to the Oveedia database marks yet another major property listing exclusively on Pure's dual database software.\n\"The timing of this new relationship perfectly coincides with the beta testing of our platform, providing greater viability to Oveedia's dual hospitality database,\" stated Melvin Pereira , President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. \"Not only is the Samasati Retreat unlike many hotels throughout Costa Rica , it is actually located on the Caribbean side of the country. This means that in a very short period of time, Oveedia has already established a presence within the country that spans from the Pacific Coast to the Caribbean Coast.\"\nPure Hospitality adds Samasati Resort to Oveedia database , after Samasati's management contacted Pure about increasing traffic and online bookings. The Samasati, a destination resort built for travelers who 'live life off the beaten path', prides itself on being a true LOHAS resort (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability). A $290 Billion U.S. market – and growing – LOHAS, which are located throughout Central America and the Caribbean , in most cases have little to no online visibility. However, global visibility and increased bookings is what Oveedia offers to all LOHAS operating within a virtually untapped region of the Americas, giving the Company a 'first movers' advantage to become the Airbnb and Priceline of Central America and the Caribbean .\n\"We are very pleased to be working with Oveedia and truly commend Mr. Pereira for the platform that he is building,\" stated Anthony Finno , Owner of the Samasati Retreat and Rainforest Sanctuary . \"The Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica is a place you discover and either want to rave to the world about, or keep as your best secret. A confluence of Costa Rican and Caribbean lifestyles offer an experience you can only find here. There is a vibe akin to indigenous Central America meets Miami meets bright-colored calypso Rastafarian. We are surrounded by unique boutique properties and a plethora of amazing 'mom and pop' restaurants, making a visit to Samasati a truly amazing experience.\"\nPereira concluded, \"While Pure Hospitality adds Samasati Resort to Oveedia database , we are very proud to expand our reach to the Caribbean side of the country. As properties continue to sign up directly with Oveedia, we anticipate a sudden and rapid acceptance of our platform upon the release of Oveedia beta version 1.0.\"\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
