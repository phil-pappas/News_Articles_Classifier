Most people assume that these elite “10 percenters” enjoy success because of their superior angling skills, but that’s really only half the story.\nWhile knowing how to fish is certainly vital, it’s equally important to know where to fish in a given body of water. You can be a brilliant caster and be a master of the retrieve, but none of this makes a difference if the fish simply aren’t there.\nAnd to find the fish, you have to be able to read the water, which means being able to determine the most likely places you’ll find holding or cruising fish.\nThere are a few basic rules that apply whether you’re fishing a lake, a river or the ocean.\nFirst, be a stealthy observer. As you approach the water, stop well back from the edge until you can be sure that you won’t scare any fish before you get a chance to cast. Seeing the fish — whether it’s a bass on a bed, a rising trout or a school of stripers crashing bait — lets you know exactly where to start fishing and saves time.\nNext, look for the three things that fish crave: cover, food and margins. Cover — such as weed beds, fallen trees, overhanging vegetation or rocks — offers a safe haven for prey species and a place to hide for ambush predators.\nAs for margins, fish simply love them. Margins are the edges between deep water and shallow water, between fast water and slow water or between cover and open water.\nWherever there is a current, fish will look for places where they can hold in slower water while allowing faster currents to deliver food to them.\nLakes and Ponds\nWhen you’re fishing in still water from the bank, you don’t have the luxury of cruising from spot to spot to find fish the way you can in a boat. So choose your spot wisely.\nAvoid featureless areas with little cover and uniform depth; instead, look for weeds and rocks and places where depth changes quickly.\nIf there’s any wind, fish the downwind side of the lake. Wind and waves concentrate food against the shoreline and attract predators such as bass, walleye and trout.\nYour first order of business is to identify the best cover — weed beds, a fallen tree or rocks. Bass, especially, will hold tight to cover.\nNext, look for places where shallow water meets deeper water — a sharp drop-off, a submerged point or a deep channel. The best places to fish are those that offer both cover and a change in depth.\nRivers\nRivers present a different dimension due to the current, but the principles are similar to those applied to lakes and ponds.\nBecause fish in moving water must expend energy to fight the current, they don’t usually live in the fast water. Instead, you’ll find them where they’re able to hold in slower water and still have access to the food conveyor belt that the faster water represents.\nAny area that offers cover and also breaks the current — rocks, woody debris, a bend in the river — offers a potential fish lie.\nConcentrate your attention on the “seams” between the faster water and slower water, which you can often identify by looking for the line of bubbles on the surface.\nSince the current near the surface is faster than the one on the bottom, deep slots and pools are also good places to fish.\nSalt Water\nFind more tips and advice to make your next outdoor adventure a great one in USA TODAY's Hunt & Fish magazine, on newsstands through Sept. 26. (Photo: STUDIO Gannett)\nAgain, focus on places where you find cover, depth change and tidal currents — a rocky jetty at the mouth of a bay, for instance.\nBecause species such as striped bass, false albacore and bonitos often chase schools of baitfish, scan the surface for “nervous water,” a sign of bait schooling just below.\nAnd watch for birds flocking over a specific spot; wherever you find diving birds, you’ll find fish below.\nRead //usat.ly/1Nh7WDW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/843c40840f3c87c16d817ef80672855886ddbcf8/c=33-0-542-383&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745458181258694-HF-FishingWater-1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a945f56d0ef5b97fd8b2320cd1b97d93b1a40ad/c=3-0-358-473&r=183&c=0-0-180-238/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745465065938958-09-HF-2015-COVER.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745465065938958-09-HF-2015-COVER.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1Nh7WDW", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Nh7WDW&text=Fishing%20trip%20advice%3A%20How%20to%20read%20the%20water%20before%20you%20cast%20your%20line&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Nh7WDW&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745458181258694-HF-FishingWater-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-08T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T22:37:12.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
