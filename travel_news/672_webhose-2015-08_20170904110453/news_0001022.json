A further 73,000 people are indirectly employed bringing the total number of people employed as a result of tourism to around 170,000 (or 8.3 per cent of all New Zealand’s employment)*.\n“We are also starting to see more visitors arriving outside of the traditional summer period and a wider regional distribution of visitor spending – all positive signs for the long-term growth of the industry and New Zealand’s regions.\nData released today by the Statistics New Zealand show that for the year-ending July 2015, over three million visitors came to the country, an increase of 7.3 per cent on the previous 12 months.\nLeading the way was the Australians at 1.29 million maintaining steady growth of 4.1 per cent.\nNew Zealand’s second largest source of visitor arrivals are the Chinese at 315,248, growing at 29.5 per cent year on year.\nThe UK, USA, Germany and Japan round out New Zealand’s top six source markets.\nKevin says potential visitors to New Zealand continue to associate the country with landscapes and scenery, wildlife, and adventure.\nSource:-Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:44:06.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
