Peloponnese In the Peloponnese Arcadia region, the Mainalo Trail winds through almost 50 miles of magnificent mountain scenery taking in the Lousios River gorge, the Mylaontas River valley and the south-eastern mountains of the Gortyna area. Following paths that date from antiquity the trail passes through a dozen traditional villages and many cultural and historic centres. Mount Pelion, a land steeped in myth and legend, offers the hiker a wide range of excursions It also qualifies for the highest status awarded by the European Ramblers’ Association, that of Leading Quality Trails, Best Of Europe. This award takes in overall safety as well scenic beauty and adventure. Along the trail are numerous traditional guesthouses and hotels as well as centres for mountain biking, canoeing and kayaking. Mount Pelion The idyllic countryside around Mount Pelion, a land steeped in myth and legend, offers the hiker a wide range of excursions from a gentle wander to a strenuous expedition, all taking in breathtaking scenery. The village of Tsagkarada is the starting point for an “easy” one hour stroll that starts by the 1,000-year-old plane tree in the main square, meanders along cobbled streets and out to the pristine Aegean beach of Damouchari. A little more demanding is the six-mile hike that starts in Kala Nera, a stunning village filled with gushing fountains. A trail to Milies follows an old railway line through countryside filled with wild flowers and birdsong. At Milies board the legendary Moutzouris, the country’s oldest railway, for a trip around the slopes of Mt Pelion. Traversing the spectacular Vikos Gorge takes time, stamina and planning... A strenuous but hugely rewarding five-hour trek from Veneto arrives at the Monastery of Flamouri via thick forests of chestnut and oak, running water and wild ravines. Epirus Traversing the spectacular Vikos Gorge takes time, stamina and planning but the rewards are incomparable. Starting a little way beyond the Monodendri village it stretches some 18 miles and reaches depths of more than 3,280ft. At its widest it is 7,218ft. Routes are signed and the gorge teems with rare fauna and unique flora. Mount Olympus As well as being the abode of the gods, Mt Olympus is also home to 1,700 species of flowers, 100 of birds and 30 of mammals.

At the easier end of the spectrum are the walks from the town of Litohoro, easily accessible by train and car. Follow signs for the church of Aghios Yoannis and follow a well marked trail that takes in spectacular views of peaks in the Enipeas gorge. The region around the world-famous Mt Athos is a magnet for those fascinated by history The walk takes around four gentle hours and climbs to 3,150ft.

A highpoint along the way is the ancient Monastery of St Dionysus and the spectacular gorge waterfalls.
