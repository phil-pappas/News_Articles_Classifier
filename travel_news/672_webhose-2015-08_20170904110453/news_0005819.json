Saying that it is just too difficult not to charge the VAT included price is nonsense - their systems are clever enough to reclaim the VAT so treating customers fairly should be simple. \n“This is tantamount to racketeering and if rip-off merchants wont play fair by the travelling public then the Government need to act. \n“They should make it illegal to charge VAT if it is not due or consider abolishing the VAT exemption and recycling the extra revenue to lower Air Passenger Duty.” Readers' comments (2) Alan Bowen | Wed, 12 Aug 2015 1:42 pm \nThis is certainly a scandal. Shops act as tax collectors for VAT, much as airlines do for APD but if the shops are not paying the government the tax they collect, they shouldn't be collecting it in the first place. Unsuitable or offensive? Report this comment race welch | Wed, 12 Aug 2015 2:14 pm \nAnother form of corruption is uncovered in this country , yet again the captive audience as passengers continue to be abused and fleeced . The airport shops already mark up goods by a whopping 100% to supposedly cover BAA costs and then claim the VAT back. You cannot bring bottled water or drinks through security but you can buy them at rip-off prices in the airside shops.
