Many restaurants have long and colorful histories, signature dishes and an atmosphere that can't be replicated. But there are also relative newcomers with much to offer the adventurous diner, such as a clothing-optional restaurant in Key West. The following unique dining options are guaranteed to keep you talking about the experience for years. North Florida Most nights at Picolo's - The Red Bar in Grayton Beach, you can sink into a comfy couch to hear the bar's jazz band. This funky restaurant, housed in an old general store, features funky d é cor including busts on the piano. The menus are simple: salads, sandwiches, a Belgian waffle and mimosas are lunch items. Choose from just six dinners -- including a fish dish and a shrimp and crawfish dish -- most of which come with a salad billed as the best on the Emerald Coast. Feed fish right from your table at Santa Maria Restaurant in St. Augustine. The eatery, which specializes in seafood and steaks, is on the water, situated on a landing in Matanzas Bay that was once used as a commercial fishing dock. Thousands of fish teem around the landing waiting and expecting to be fed by diners. Mullet, catfish, pan fish, trout and needle fish can usually be seen from March through September. Visit www.santamariarestaurant.com or phone 904-829-6578.
