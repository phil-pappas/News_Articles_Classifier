There are a number of studies that highlight the drop-off point after eight seconds, so don’t waste everyone’s time with an excessively long intro,” he adds. Find your people Look for keywords around your product or industry on YouTube to find out what the conversation already looks like. Begin trying to reach the people who already like your product by commenting on their videos or “friending” them. Much like Twitter, you need to participate in the YouTube community to really get the best from it. Many channels have built up their following by working with other influencers in their field, helping to share each others’ channels, holding videos together or discussing topics with each other. “This crossover can drastically increase channel subscribers,” says Mr Bourlet. Join it all up Andrew Firth, owner of digital agency Ascensor Ltd, says: “Brand your channel with company’s colours, logos and icons so users will be able to identify it instantly.” He adds: “And keep content for customers separate from corporate content so users view the correct videos.” Make sure you integrate your channel across other content you provide; embed your YouTube content on your website and share links on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. “By reusing this content, the reach and the impact of your content investments increases,” says Professor Steven Van Belleghem, digital marketing expert and author of When Digital Becomes Human. Be consistent but don’t be boring Loyal subscribers will expect a video on a consistent basis, whether this is every Friday or once a day. “Don’t upload a number of videos at once, then go a month without posting, as this can be frustrating for the subscriber. It’s a balance between quantity and quality,” says Mr Bourlet. Use the freedom of the channel to try something a little different from your usual campaigns too. Be smart with your subject matter Think about what people might be searching for or might need to know about your service. You might even pick up your competitors’ fans too. Follow the news and search for stories that can be linked to your business, says Prof Van Belleghem. He says: “Release content about the things that are happening in the world. The goal of this real-time content marketing is to increase the reach on your different digital channels.” To this end, he says: “Hijack other people's stories to get the attention to your brand, but choose your battles in this field. Don't try to be present in every news story. Choose news stories that match the DNA of your brand.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • How SMEs can make the most of sports sponsorship • Top seedfunding tips for SMEs • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:25:22.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
