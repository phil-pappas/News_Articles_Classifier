They have to buy ringgit and the demand is created. So the situation is not all that bad as it seems and there is a silver lining even though the country is witnessing an economic deluge, he added.\nTourism is a key contributor to Malaysia’s economy and one of the largest sources of foreign exchange income for the nation. For tourists on the streets, the weak ringgit is boosting their spending power he opined.\nNow ringgit is 4.5 for one euro, it was beneath 4 a couple of months ago, tourists are enjoying the slump and are spending more. They are beginning to enjoy their stay in Malaysia.\nTravel agents of Malaysia, Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (MATTA) are at one with the minister’s opinion. The industry is in fact benefitting from the declining currency. However the agents also felt that there could be a risk on the country’s local tourism industry as they cannot afford to travel abroad.\nThe President of MATTA, Hamzah Rahmat, said tourism is a two way traffic and if there is no outbound there will be no inbound as the aviation industry is dependent on both sided traffic. He is also skeptical and feels that if the situation is not handled with caution then the declining ringgit could also drive away tourists. He also blamed excessive political speculation as being a reason for the declining ringgit. He however dismissed allegations of money laundering which is being held as one of the major reason for the drop in currency value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:52:01.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
