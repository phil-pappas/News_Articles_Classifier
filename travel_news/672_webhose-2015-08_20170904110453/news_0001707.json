It’s one of the reasons that so many people decide to give up the day job and start their own ventures – to be their own boss, choose their own hours, and shake off the shackles of corporate life. But frequently, the very people who start new businesses become part of the problem, building inflexible work environments. This is often because they worry about the possible challenges of throwing out the old rule book – if all your staff are working midday to 5pm or midnight to 3am, who will answer that urgent client email that lands at 10am? But there are a few brave souls who have not only embraced the new, flexible lifestyle for themselves, they have extended the benefits to their people too. The start-up has ditched all the age-old people management techniques Take Potato, which builds web applications for companies such as Google, 10 Downing Street and the White House. Founded in 2010 by chief executive Jason Cartwright and his friend Luke Guttridge, the start-up has ditched all the age-old people management techniques – there are no rules over allocated holidays, no working hours and no compulsory time in the office. It’s a bold move, and one that will probably strike fear into the hearts of many business owners. I asked Jason to talk about the model to find out if it’s really possible to abdicate all draconian powers over one’s staff – does it result in chaos? Here's the skinny on how to do business the Potato way: Rebecca: Without allocated holidays, do staff take more time off? Jason: On average, we see staff taking less time off in total than they might have with allocated annual leave. We don’t count paid leave, so this assessment is based on impression alone. Instead, our uncapped policy empowers people to take time out as and when they need to, rather than feeling the need to fulfil a quota. R: How do you ensure that lots of people aren’t off work at the same time? J: Vacations are timed around workloads, and we find people tend to enjoy being part of a successful project delivery before grabbing a well-earned break. R: Why do people need to work different hours? What’s wrong with the old model? J: Each person has a slightly different approach to the work they do. By opening up the working day, we can cater to people’s workplace idiosyncrasies to let them do what feels right rather than what their manager says is right. Not everyone is a morning person, for instance, but likely works well late into the night. Conversely there may be early birds who run out of steam in the afternoon. These people all do great work, but in a nine-to-five model we’d never get the best from all of them. R: Why is this flexible model so popular now? J: With the technology available to us all now, it’s no longer the case that everything must be done at the office, and along with that goes the notion that office hours are the only productive time of day. We use “the cloud” extensively to do our work – emails, files and all our internal tools can be accessed from anywhere without fiddling with virtual private networks, or having to use a specific computer. This keeps us flexible, and able to capitalise on our team members’ personal working preferences. R: So why do you have offices in London, Bristol, San Francisco and Sydney if they are so old hat? J: We still appreciate a valuable role for the office in all this – you can’t beat a face-to-face meeting to quickly get through complicated problems and produce new ideas. R: Are there gaps in your service? Times when no one is working in the day? J: Quite the opposite. Allowing people to choose to work when they want to also means they are amenable to working when they need to. So, for every month-long holiday someone takes, or an unannounced sunny afternoon off because their project is not very busy, we’ll have someone happily replying to an email at 11pm in the evening. The flexibility cuts both ways to everyone’s benefit. R: Does this only work for small companies, where everyone can keep tabs on everyone else? J: Our team stands at just over 90 people, currently expanding at around 30pc per year. R: Does anyone take the p*ss? J: So far we haven’t had any cases of people taking advantage of this system. If you’re employing the right people, you won’t need to worry about exploitation of freedom, as individuals are setting their own standards that build on those expected by the wider organisation. Of course, you’ll occasionally get an employee who does struggle in a permissive and relaxed environment, and we’ve implemented a quick and simple feedback system to ensure everyone is growing alongside the company’s continued expansion, and that conversations around performance are open, honest, straightforward and most of all, actionable and productive. Striking a healthy balance between freedom and guidance will result in people take greater personal responsibility for the success of a project (and in turn the wider company). R: Could any company do this? Or just whizzy tech start-ups? J: This isn’t a way of working that all businesses can necessarily just pick up, but I think that there are certainly ideas that all businesses could adopt from companies that take a more open approach to work. Our hours and holiday policy are part of the workings of the company, and are also an attractive recruitment tool. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Confessions of a crowdfunder • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses • Building the right team for your SME • Making flexible working work • Negative feedback: why it pays to listen to your customers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:48:29.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
