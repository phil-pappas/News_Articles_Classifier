Laura Begley Bloom Executive Editor August 18, 2015 \nPolice investigators work near the statue of Phra Phrom at the Erawan Shrine the morning after an explosion in Bangkok.

The only country that has advised its citizens to avoid non-essential trips to Thailand is Hong Kong, which has raised its travel alert for Bangkok to red. \nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand said security in Bangkok has been increased “in all the popular tourist areas of the city as a preventative measure to ensure the safety of both tourists and residents” and has warned travelers to remain vigilant. Otherwise, shops, attractions, hotels, public transportation, and airports are open and running as usual. \n“Despite the recent tragic events, Bangkok is still a very safe destination for tourists,” the Tourism Authority said in a statement. \nHowever, the incidents have left travelers from around the world wondering: is it safe to travel to Bangkok now? \nOne of many messages of condolence left for victims of the bomb blast at Rajprasong intersection near the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok on Tuesday, Aug. 18.

But there was no avoiding this. It looks like they were targeting tourists. It looks like they wanted casualties, where in the past it was more about scare tactics,” she said. “So it’s a little bit scarier. You can’t avoid certain areas of the city. There’s fear in the general population more than in the past.” \nRelated: How to Travel in the Age of Terrorism \nBangkok and Thailand are no stranger to bombings. In February, two pipe bombs exploded outside Bangkok’s Sian Paragon shopping mall, injuring two people, while in 2012 a series of explosions in the city injured five. Other areas of Thailand that have been attacked include Koh Samui (an underground parking area at a shopping mall was bombed earlier this year), the southern Thai city of Hat Yai (in 2014 three bombs wounded eight people), and Chiang Mai, which had two bombings in its night markets in 2012. \nAs for the American government’s position, there is concern about “a continued risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia, including in Thailand,” warns the U.S. State Department . “While traveling in Thailand you should exercise caution, especially in locations where expatriates congregate, such as clubs, discos, bars, restaurants, hotels, places of worship, schools, outdoor recreation venues, tourist areas, beach resorts, and other places frequented by foreigners.” \nBritain’s Foreign Office says there is a “high threat of terrorism” and that “bomb and grenade attacks have been indiscriminate, including in places visited by expatriates and foreign travellers.\" \nA man prays near the Erawan Shrine the morning after the explosion.

Jonathan Stephenson , artistic director of Bourne West Productions and Producer at Sugarlump Productions, didn’t cancel his Thailand honeymoon. “We’re off to Thailand for our honeymoon,” he wrote on Instagram . “Thank you everyone for your well wishes and love. We have a lot of drinks to buy for people when we’re back. See you on the flipside.” \nAnd Brandy Fisher , founder and CEO of Youth Across America and Miss California 2014 , wrote on Twitter that she “randomly booked a solo trip to Thailand last night for 10 days in November #Phuket.” But she told Yahoo Travel that she will “continue to monitor the activity over there in the coming months.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:07:29.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
