And while Memorial Day often means battling the huge crowds taking advantage of the start of summer, and July 4th can mean fighting sizzling mid-summer temperatures, Labor Day weekend combines the best of both worlds – smaller crowds and moderating late-summer temperatures. \nMost Searched Labor Day Destinations \nFor the 2015 Labor Day weekend, warm-weather locales dominate the list of Travelocity's most searched destinations. Along with perennial favorites like Las Vegas and Orlando, beach towns within driving distance of major metro areas also hit the top ten with travelers making the long holiday weekend a perfect time for a quick road trip. According to a recent survey by Travelocity, 65 percent of Americans are more likely to take a road trip this year than last. \n1. Las Vegas 7. Fort Walton Beach – Destin, FL 8. Miami 10. San Diego, CA \nUnder-the-Radar Labor Day Experiences \nWhile any of the top ten most searched destinations would make for an ideal Labor Day weekend, Travelocity's travel experts have come up with two places that may not be top-of-mind for a summer getaway, but offer uniquely local Labor Day experiences. \nDetroit – Music fans can get their fill of jazz music over the Labor Day weekend, when downtown Detroit plays host to the Detroit Jazz Festival. Now in its 36th year, this four-day event features an eclectic lineup of jazz artists playing on four stages at what is billed as the world's largest free jazz festival. \nAnd when festival-goers have had their fill of music, nearby Novi is home to the Michigan State Fair, also held annually over the Labor Day weekend. An equestrian pavilion, hot dog and corn on the cob eating contests, a farmers market, and even a life-size cow made of butter are some of the traditional attractions at the Michigan State Fair. \nPark City, UT – Known primarily for the Sundance Film Festival and its world-famous ski resorts, Park City celebrates its history as a mining town each Labor Day with its Miner's Day festivities. Along with 5K and 10K races, a \"mucking and drilling\" competition that simulates the work once done in area silver mines, the \"Running of the Balls\" is considered by many to be the highlight of the day. \nUsing balls rather than bulls for the \"running\", and taking advantage of gravity on Park City's steep inclines, hundreds of balls are sold to the public and released down Main Street, with prizes for the first balls to cross the finish line and proceeds going to charity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T05:31:08.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
