The two-day event is designed for attendees to engage key decision-makers in Latin American travel, and pre-scheduled 15-minute meetings assist buyers and sellers in developing strong, business-producing relationships. \n“We are not a trade show where vendors stand in a booth and delegates walk around a pavilion hoping to meet potential clients. Our emphasis is on business being personal,” says Managing Director Rick Still. “We understand the strong role relationships play in the business of travel, and recognized that there was a major void in what the existing conferences and expos were offering, especially in relation to Latin America. In order to fill that gap in the market, we created a different kind of trade show to fit that niche, where cultivating personal relationships with suppliers and buyers is the priority.” \nLa Cita targets travel industry professionals who realize the tremendous value of conducting business in the Latin American and Caribbean markets, including suppliers, buyers, visitors to the US, travel media, large retail travel agencies that handle leisure, meetings, incentives and corporate travel, and marketing service organizations. \n“Strong relationships and partnerships are especially important to successfully doing business in Latin America. The culture in these countries is very personal and familiar and business is conducted as such,” says Director of Operations Matt Still. “A huge emphasis is placed on trust, long-standing relationships, and a mutual understanding of the opportunities and pressures related to their industry, and they can find all of this at La Cita.” \nLa Cita de las America’s will take place at the Boca Raton Resort and Club September 2-4, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:31:45.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
