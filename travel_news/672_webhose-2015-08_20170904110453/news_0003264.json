Residential broadband leads the way, with good opportunities for sustained growth in revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and margins. With almost 1,000 aircraft in service spanning commercial, government and general aviation markets, in-flight connectivity is a significant contributor.\nJetBlue and United are setting the commercial aeronautical Wi-Fi pace, and we’re excited about our recently announced partnership with Virgin America. Our government business grew revenues 24% and Adjusted EBITDA 35% – also driven by satellite broadband as well as tactical data links. We continue to invest in delivering higher broadband speeds, more bandwidth, more coverage and better service across our markets, and see significant opportunities for continued growth.”\nFinancial Results\n(In millions, except per share data)\nQ1 FY16\nQ1 FY15\nYear-Over-\nYear\nChange\nRevenues\n$\n344.4\n$\n319.5\n7.8%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n77.5\n$\n60.2\n28.9%\nNet income (loss) 1\n$\n2.6\n$\n(5.9)\n143.9%\nDiluted per share net income (loss) 1\n$\n0.05\n$\n(0.13)\n138.5%\nNon-GAAP net income 1\n$\n12.1\n$\n2.4\n401.5%\nNon-GAAP diluted per share net income 1\n$\n0.25\n$\n0.05\n400.0%\nFully diluted weighted average shares 2\n48.8\n46.5\n5.0%\nNew contract awards\n$\n305.5\n$\n310.1\n(1.5)%\nSales backlog 3\n$\n872.5\n$\n892.3\n(2.2)%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:47:04.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
