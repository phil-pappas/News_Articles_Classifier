A low six-digit amount would be adequate compensation, Elmar Giemulla, a lawyer representing some of the victims, said last month. \n“We are preparing a lawsuit in the United States and see good chances for a place of jurisdiction there,” Bild am Sonntag quoted Giemulla as saying. Damage claims have not been set yet but plaintiffs will follow American law, Giemulla said. \nGermanwings yesterday declined to comment on the report but said compensation would be “at least €100,000” per passenger and, depending on families’ circumstances, reach a high six-digit amount that could rise up to a million euro. \n“It’s our concern that the relatives will as quickly as possible receive the compensation payments they are entitled to,” the carrier said. \nThe planned legal action will aim to find out why co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who had previously suffered from depression, was allowed to fly, Giemulla said. \nGiemulla did not return calls seeking comment. \nEvidence shows Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit of Germanwings flight 4U9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf and deliberately steered the plane into a remote mountainside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:33:37.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
