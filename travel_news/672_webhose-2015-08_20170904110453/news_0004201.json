The volcano greeted locals and tourists with two explosions in the morning that sent ash plumes into the air. Climbers on the mountain heard the explosions, and many awoke to find ash all over their vehicles and yards. \nScientists will attempt to fly over the summit to gather information. So far it is believed that the ash is from old lava being pushed out by steam. This is all following a series of small quakes that have been occurring over the past few days. It is not known if this is an isolated incident or if there is the possibility that magma is brewing below the surface. \nCotopaxi National Park has been closed due to the volcanic activity, but no evacuations have been ordered. The last time Cotopaxi erupted was in the early 1940s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T12:28:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
