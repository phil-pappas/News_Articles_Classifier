Like QE and QE2, virtually zero interest rates were an emergency measure to combat the Panic of 2008 and the Great Recession. As Barry Ritholtz wrote , “Today, the panic is a receding memory. Interest at zero is an emergency setting. Why do we still have a Fed policy designed for an economy that needed life-support?”\nThey want to head off any inflationary pressures. Also, they want to have some monetary water pressure if needed to combat a future recessionary fire. Ideally, Janet Yellen and her colleagues want to engineer the familiar “soft landing” of the Greenspan years.\nBut the risks are numerous. Fed watcher and University of Oregon Professor Tim Duy argues that the central bank already pulled off a soft landing by tapering off its QE bond-buying program. Inflation expectations are low. And the dangers of credit tightening are more serious than the central bankers think. (Indeed, according to a leak earlier this summer, the staff’s forecasts are gloomier than the public pronouncements of the Fed governors).\nMost Read Stories Chelan blazes: With no end in sight, thousands evacuate Percy Harvin doubles down on comments about his Seahawks tenure Reactions mixed to NYT story about Amazon’s work conditions Jeff Bezos says Amazon won’t tolerate ‘callous’ management practices Inside Amazon: wrestling big ideas in a bruising workplace Falling oil prices are a sign of deflation that is already besetting some markets. Want more proof — the swoon is hitting almost all commodities (and in all currencies), not just crude. China’s economic slowdown is very real. The eurozone is weak even outside of Greece. Emerging markets are set for trouble; the only question is which one goes first. Turkey? Brazil? Indonesia ?\nToday’s “normal” is not the relatively strong growth, abundant jobs and low inflation — the “virtuous cycle” — of the 1980s and 1990s. Growth is slow all over. Six years into the recovery, such measures of labor-market health as long-term unemployment, labor-force participation, the “quits rate” and the wider U-6 unemployment rate are still not where they stood before the recession.\nGrowth of gross domestic product is the slowest of the post-World War II era, unless you count the short recession of 1980 and its weak recovery before Paul Volcker lowered the boom in 1981. Government spending and investment is abysmal thanks to austerity.\nSo as the Fed raises rates, it will be a close-run thing, definitely new territory, and plenty of Americans are still hurting. This last element is very different from previous recoveries.\nFinally, a note for savers: Don’t expect much. The interest-rate rise will not give you the returns of old. On the other hand, you don’t risk losing money in an insured CD. Borrowers will pay more.\nToday’s Econ Haiku:\nBezos a monster?\nMany moguls have been charged\nAnd unions tamed them", "external_links": ["https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2015/august/fomc-monetary-policy-normalization/", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-staff-forecasts-that-the-fed-accidentally-leaked-2015-07-24", "http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-13/the-fed-is-on-thinner-ice-than-it-realizes-and-it-may-be-setting-us-up-for-recession", "http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-08-10/fed-policy-on-verge-of-returning-to-normal"], "published": "2015-08-18T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:41:04.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
