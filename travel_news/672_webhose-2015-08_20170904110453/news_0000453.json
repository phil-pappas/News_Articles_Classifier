Alan Mason, the MD of Mason's Travel, Guillaume Albert, the MD of Creole Travel and Daniella Payet-Alis, the Owner of Seychelles Reservations who was also representing her group of small 'home grown' hotels on Mahe, Praslin, La Digue and Cerf Islands. Also present was Arie Goldstein, the Seychelles Honorary Consul based in Israel. \nThe 49 page full colour Travel Manual brings to life what the Seychelles offers to its visitors with picture perfect photographs of the scenery and natural beauty of these mid-ocean islands. Seychelles is one tourism destination dependent on its tourism industry which has become the pillar of its economy. This is why these islands continue to be not only innovative in the work they do to keep themselves visible and relevant in the world of tourism, but they also levee no stones unturned in diversifying their tourism source markets. \nIsrael is just the latest country to see Seychelles move in to claim their fair share of the Israeli holiday makers. It was confirmed during this working visit by Minister Alain St.Ange that between now and December this year two Israeli Tour Operators would be operating some six dedicated non-stop charters to Seychelles from Tel Aviv. \nThe Spirit World of Yativ Tali who has been operating an El AL 777 plane for her direct non-stop charters to the islands has confirmed that they will continue their Seychelles Operations even as they are now joined by Arkia & Carmel Tourism Services with their own charters to the islands. Seychelles is also pushing forward their cooperation that is existing with Ethiopian Airlines who are now operating four weekly flights to Seychelles form Addis Ababa that connect well with their daily flights to Tel Aviv. The Seychelles Tourism Industry said in Tel Aviv that they have recognised the strong presence of Turkish Airlines in Israel and see this as a further opportunity as this Airline continues to grow their presence in the area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:01:50.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
