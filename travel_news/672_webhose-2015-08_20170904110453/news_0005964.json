In June, the festival committee canceled this year’s event, citing a lack of financial support. \nThat is when Stan Braxton sprang into action. The pastor of the Upper Room Assembly and Worship Center in Coshocton organized a group of seven volunteers from his church and announced that they would revive the community tradition. \n“We decided that, even if we had to pay for everything ourselves, we would put on Canal Days,” Braxton said. “To not have it would be like a page of our history book torn out. It would be a gaping hole.” \nWith financial support from the community, the determined group has arranged a slate of activities that includes live music (country performer Adam Calvert is the headliner at 7 p.m. Saturday), vendors, a car show (Sunday) and a “Kiddieland” with bounce houses and face painting. \nThe traditional parade will step off at 5 p.m. Saturday. The only part missing from Canal Days will be the crowning of the Canal Queen, which has been moved to October in conjunction with the Apple Butter Stirrin’ Festival at Roscoe Village. \nRoscoe Village, a restored canal town, is the city’s most popular attraction. \nJan Myers, director of the Coshocton Visitors Bureau, recommended two other nearby attractions for families looking to flesh out the day: \n• Clary Gardens , founded in 2001, is an “emerging botanical garden” featuring 20 acres of hills, fields, ponds and a ravine to explore. Best of all, it’s free. (740-622-6254, www.clarygardens.org \n• Coshocton Lake Park includes nature trails, a canal boat ride, and a pool complex with waterslides. (740-622-7528, www.coshoctonlakepark.com \nHikes for Tykes ADENA MANSION, 847 ADENA RD., CHILLICOTHE \nTime: 2 p.m. Sunday \nContact: 740-772-1500, www.adenamansion.com \nThe Ohio History Connection helps oversee the early 19th-century home of Thomas Worthington, an Ohio governor and U.S. senator. Tours of the mansion are popular, but the staff also conducts regular children’s programming during the summer for youngsters who may not consider an old house all that exciting. \nThe Hikes for Tykes is a first-time event. A naturalist from Tar Hollow State Park will lead children on a tour of the mansion’s 300-acre grounds, highlighted by a stop at a pond. Children will be given nets to see what they can scoop up. \n“We’re excited to see what the turnout will be,” said Beth Beatty, the education, volunteer and events coordinator at Adena. \nThe hike, which should take 60 to 90 minutes, is free. If visitors want to come early or stay late and tour the mansion, normal admission applies — $5 to $10, or free for members and children 5 and younger. \nGene Betts of the Ross County-Chillicothe Convention & Visitors Bureau recommended several other nearby destinations that families might want to explore: \n• The Chillicothe Railway Museum is in Yoctangee Park, at Water and Paint streets. It consists of two red cabooses packed with train memorabilia. It’s free; on the day of the hike, it is open from noon to 3 p.m. (740-702-7675) \n• At 7 p.m. Sunday , a special performance will take place at the Sugarloaf Mountain Amphitheatre, where the nightly Tecumseh! drama plays out each summer. The performance, Shadows of Destiny , is a one-time show about Tecumseh meeting Thomas Worthington. Tickets cost $15.
