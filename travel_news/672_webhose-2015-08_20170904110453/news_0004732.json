I have a trip planned for a short duration of 4 days (unfortunately on a time crunched tour). I have gone through a number of helpul posts in Indiamike on Meghalaya - specially @karikor' and @iamsomath's We are a group of 8 - 9 friends travelling on 20th Aug (2015. I have made a high level trip plan and would love to have your inputs: Day1( Thursday ): Reach Guwahati Airport at 9:30am Cab to Cherrapunji (or through Guwahati Polton Bazaar)  Check in at BTW (By the Way) if available (6 Hrs). Local sightseeing on foot Day2 ( Friday ) : Start at 6am. Double decker root bridge trek (Nongriat village homestay or same day back to Sohra by 6pm) . If not going for Homestay, reach Mawphlang and sighseeing Day3 ( Saturday ) : Start at 6:30am. Transfer to Shillong (tentatively will reach by 8:30am max)  check in at white orchid  Local sightseeing (MTDC if available or else cab) Day4 ( Sunday ): First half at Shillong  Elephant Falls(Top & bottom) and Umium Lake  Leave for Guwahati at 2pm max if not visiting Umium Reach Guwahati at 6pm Now I need some suggestions on the tour logistics itself: 1. Any spots that can be covered during Day 1 journey?  nohkalikai falls, mawsmai cave, Dain thlen falls / Kynrem Falls or any other points. If not, we can just hang out in late afternoon/early evening in Sohra ( For all of us, this is the first trip to Meghalaya). Please suggest 2. The trek to Umshiang double decker root bridge  Is the trail doable in rains? I guess the natural pools will not be accessible due too much water in river. Are there places to explore near the Double Decker bridge? I heard there are sacred groves near this place too. Will it be better to head over to Mawphlung and explore there 3. For Day 3, I have kept it to be a Shillong/outskirts sightseeing tour day trip . However, all of us are love adventure lovers/nature trail lovers rather than city hangout folks. What options do we have for single day trip? Mawlynlong or Mawlyngba(latter seems to be quite far off from Sohra as far I read) 4. On this day, we need to get back to Guwahati by evening (as next day , we have early morning flight). Any better suggestions for spots to cover ? I know the trip duration is too (insanely) short to tour Meghalaya. We would prefer to have more of an adventure trip rather than cosy/lazy touring.
