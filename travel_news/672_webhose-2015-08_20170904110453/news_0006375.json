The trip highlights included \"excursions to see whales by boat in Juneau,\" Schoenherr says, \"fjords by seaplane in Juneau and a fantastic helicopter trip to the top of a glacier in Skagway.\" \nTravel tips: \"Many people are fearful of taking a helicopter ride, but the pilots are so experienced and skillful that the ride was smooth and enjoyable. Landing on the glacier, walking around and drinking ice-cold glacier water was a unique experience. You've got to give it a try!\" Courtesy of James P. Reber GREECE: This group of Silicon Valley friends, which includes Rebecca Salner, left, Claudia Cameron, Anita Schaack and Debbie Webster, first started exploring the world together in 1995. This spring, those adventures took them to Fira (pictured) on the island of Santorini (aka Thira) in Greece. \nTravel tips: \"Wear some comfortable shoes because you will do a lot of hiking to see historical sights,\" Reber says. \"You'll also hike around the more relaxing areas, such as Santorini. Most Greeks speak English very well and are very friendly. The food is great, so bring an appetite.\" Courtesy of Nancy Casey Advertisement COSTA RICA: Morgan Hill resident Nancy Casey went zip lining while attending a yoga retreat on the Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica. \"The area is beautiful,\" she says. \"Macaws fly through during the day, howler monkeys 'entertain' during the night and the jungle flora is lush green with colorful flowers. Our resort had delicious food, predominately vegetarian.\" \nTravel tips: \"Costa Rica is trying very hard to be environmentally aware. Be prepared for places with no air-conditioning in a very humid, hot climate, and get used to putting used toilet paper in a trash can rather than flushing it.\" Share your travels with us!
