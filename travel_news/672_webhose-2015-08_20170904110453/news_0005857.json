If you would like to withdraw your question please press the pound key. I will now hand today's call over to Mr. Jason Liberty. Please go ahead, sir. Jason Liberty (SVP, CFO): Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Laura Hodges, our Vice President of Investor Relations. During this call, we will be referring to a few slides which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website. Richard will begin by providing an overview of the business. I will follow with the recap of our second quarter results, provide an update on the business environment, and then provide an update on our full year and third quarter guidance for 2015. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard? Richard Fain (Chairman, CEO): Thank you, Jason, and thanks to all of you in the investment community for joining us this morning. There's a lot of good stuff to talk about. Overall the year continues to turn out as of expected. Revenues are a little better, costs are up slightly and our earnings are back to within a nickel of our January guidance. To put this in perspective, foreign exchange and fuel have bounced around during the year and today have cost us a net of a negative $0.21 versus our original guidance. It was on this call a year ago that we first publicly announced our Double-Double program. And that anniversary seems like a great time to update you on our progress. The program is solidly on track to meet our twin goals of doubling our 2014 profit and reaching double-digit ROIC by 2017. The three pillars of the program were main, modest capacity growth, strong cost controls and rising revenue yields. These three pillars have not changed and they remain at the core of everything that we do. Today I would like to focus on the last two of these pillars as moderate capacity growth is firmly enhanced. Beginning on the cost side, we remain steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a cost-conscious culture. While our cost guidance is up slightly from April, it's still lower than our initial guidance of up 1% or better. This is due to the diligence of our teams and finding efficiencies and building synergies throughout our business. Most recently, we merged our single branded marine department into one world-class marine organization. The intent of this consolidation was to facilitate the sharing of best practices and to drive further efficiencies throughout our fleet. I look forward to updating you as this develops. We do believe that our cost culture as well in place and remains on course. But we really are not expecting this to be the main driver of our earnings trajectory. Rather, we expect our focus here will be to continue the hold costs to a realistic level. But the final and the most important pillar in the Double-Double is growing revenue. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:44:40.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
