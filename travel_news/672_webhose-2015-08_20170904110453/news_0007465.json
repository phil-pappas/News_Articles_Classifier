Yelp has announced an agreement with the federal government to allow the TSA and other federal agencies to claim Yelp pages and respond to reviews.\nIt's not a drastic change. Travelers have been posting comments -- well, mostly complaints -- about the Transportation Security Administration on an assortment of Yelp pages for years. But this would gather them in one official place, monitored by TSA staffers who would incorporate feedback into service improvements.\nThe idea is to make government more accountable to its citizens . In practice, it mostly gives its angriest citizens a place to vent.\nThe TSA now has official pages on Yelp, where travelers can leave reviews. The vast majority of customer reviews on Yelp's unofficial TSA pages are of the one- or two-star variety, filled with such choice phrases as \"a joke,\" \"total bozos\" and \"a crappy knockoff of the Gestapo.\" While a few travelers post positive feedback, others gripe about unfriendly TSA agents and invasive pat-downs.\nGOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina even took advantage of the announcement this week to post a one-star review of the TSA , calling it an example of an inept federal bureaucracy that she will fix if elected.\nGiven that most Americans' exposure to the TSA is in the airport security line -- a stressful place for many travelers -- the agency may not be eager for Yelp feedback. Asked Thursday about the new Yelp deal, a TSA spokesman sounded less than enthusiastic.\n\"We're still learning more about it,\" David Castelveter said, adding that the TSA already fields comments on Twitter , where it has almost 60,000 followers between its 12 accounts.\n\"We believe that there are more benefits to a real-time, two-way exchange between the TSA and travelers on Twitter,\" he said.\n15 photos: A cornucopia of TSA-seized items 15 photos: A cornucopia of TSA-seized items The U.S. Transportation Security Administration seized a record 2,212 firearms from carry-on luggage in 2014.

Hide Caption 15 of 15 The TSA is monitoring comments on Yelp but has yet to reach out to reviewers, he said.\nIn the meantime, some observers find the idea of \"reviewing\" a government agency sort of pointless. Unlike restaurant customers, most travelers can't really take their business elsewhere if they don't like a particular TSA checkpoint.\n\"What other option would you have to fly from Atlanta -- drive to Birmingham (Alabama)???\" asked one traveler . \"Gotta deal with them anyway.\"", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150123112411-01-tsa-security-0123-small-169.jpg",
