Sign In Here Jim Downton did not expect to make a career out of the hospitality industry when he started as a front-desk clerk at the now-defunct Drawbridge Inn in Fort Mitchell in order to pay his way through Northern Kentucky University. That experience, though, gave him a chance to learn from some influential leaders in the business. “Jerry Deters, owner and developer of the Drawbridge, was a big influence on me at a very early age,” Downton said. Among the most valuable advice he has gleaned from his mentors: “You hire and fill your organization with the smartest and most skilled professionals and that you eliminate the words ‘no, we can’t do that’ from your vocabulary.” During the course of his career, Downton has discovered he likes to be a part of turnaround stories. He became executive director at Sharonville’s convention center in 2012 after working as sales and marketing director for the newly expanded Duke Energy Convention Center . “It was a very exciting time to be working downtown,” he said of his time at the region’s largest convention center. “This was the very early stages of Cincinnati’s turnaround and revitalization, and there definitely was a feeling we were all a part of something special.” The Sharonville job enticed him because the city of Sharonville and Hamilton County had just invested over $25 million in expansion and renovation. The center now ranks No. 6 on the Courier’s list of the largest meeting and banquet facilities. “Sharonville was in a place similar to where downtown Cincinnati had been, on the cusp of a major turnaround,” Downton said. In 2012, you talked with the Business Courier about an expansion of the Sharonville Convention Center . How has that worked out? How do you convince people they’d rather be in Sharonville than downtown, Northern Kentucky or at another site? The Sharonville Convention Center has experienced tremendous growth in the three years since our expansion. Our events and revenues are up 70 percent, and our customer satisfaction scores are at their highest levels. We do not regularly compete against downtown or Northern Kentucky for events. Rather, we complement each other and allow our region to maximize our ability to host more events. ...We each are unique enough, both geographically and in size, that we are each able to sustain and grow our business. What’s the biggest challenge in the meeting and banquet industry right now? The industry is changing. With a few exceptions, the trend of the massive national conventions and trade shows is shrinking, and the smaller or midsize regional events are growing. Organizations are more often looking for regional locations that offer greater value. Nationally, the number of smaller convention and conference centers is growing. We have two new such projects already taking place within the I-275 belt loop – Centre Park in West Chester and the Wyndam Dolce Conference Center project near Medpace headquarters. What motivates you every day? My wife and children. What’s your favorite thing about your job? The teamwork. What was your first job? Bus boy at Josh’s Restaurant at the Drawbridge Inn and Convention Center. Are you a night owl or an early bird? Both. I recently got a Fitbit for Father’s Day and have recognized I might not be getting enough sleep. How would you want your employees to describe you? As a leader who listens and is open to new ideas and who sometimes sees value in our mistakes. What’s the longest period of time you’ve gone without checking your email? Maybe eight hours, when I am asleep.
