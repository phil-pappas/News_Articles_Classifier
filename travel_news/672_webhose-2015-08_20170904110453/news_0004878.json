Hipmunk bills itself as “the first travel website to show vacation rentals alongside hotel results.” The study included data from Airbnb, Homeaway and VacayHero, including both apartments and private rooms, alongside hotel room rates to determine the most economical vacation accommodations. In Boston, an average nightly rental rate is $186, compared to an average nightly hotel rate of $301 — an average savings of $115 per night, the Hipmunk study shows. In Nantucket, vacation rentals cost an average of $354 compared to an average hotel rate of $368 — a savings of just $14. And on Nantucket, savings are a meager $9 for a vacation rental, with an average rate of $222 per night compared to $231, the study shows. \nWant Boston Travel news in your inbox?
