Here are some questions I bet won’t be asked — and that’s too bad.\n1. Mr. Trump, you have never held elective office and have no foreign-policy experience. Many of your business ventures have landed in bankruptcy court. What qualifies you to be here?\n2. (to all) Presidents George W. Bush and Obama faced the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression. What did they do right and not so well in addressing it? How would you address such a crisis?\n3. President Obama’s Justice Department did not bring criminal charges against the CEOs of the institutions most responsible for the financial collapse. Do you agree with this or would you have sought criminal prosecutions?\nMost Read Stories ESPN video: Percy Harvin opens up about what went wrong in Seattle Amazon angst: from traffic to housing, we’re all worked up It’s election time.

American companies that enjoy the full protection and benefits of operating in the United States are stashing $2.1 trillion in profits overseas to avoid taxes. Considering President Bush’s “tax holiday” was a failure, how would you address this tax dodging?\n9. The United States suffers from the greatest income inequality since at least the eve of the Great Depression. It is worse than virtually any other advanced country. Studies show it holds back growth. What is government’s role in addressing this and what policies would you pursue?\n10. Do you believe climate change is largely the result of human activity, as do 97 percent of the scientists who actually study climate. If not, why not? If so, what policies would you pursue to keep carbon out of the atmosphere?\nHappy viewing.\nToday’s Econ Haiku:\nWill Trump steal the show?\nAs long as the wind don’t blow\nCombover crisis\nI invite you to follow me on Twitter @jontalton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T01:55:18.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
