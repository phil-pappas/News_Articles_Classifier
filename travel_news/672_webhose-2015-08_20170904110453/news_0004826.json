The abandoned Six Flags in New Orleans. Picture: Erik Zeterberg Source: Flickr \nTHEME parks should be filled with groups of friends and families, fuelled by candy floss and jostling for front row seats on supersonic vomit-inducing roller coasters. \nInstead, these places are eerily empty, a creepy silence hanging in the air, with no sign of life apart from the odd graffiti tag. \nOnce the gates closed on these tourist attractions the rides and gardens were abandoned and allowed to fall into complete disrepair - some of them never even made it this far and were never open to the public. \nTake a tour of these rotting remains and get a spooky glimpse into how holidaymakers of years gone by got their thrills. \n1. Spreepark, Berlin, Germany The creepty Spreepark. Picture: Jan Bommes Source: Flickr \nIn 1969, Kulturpark Plänterwald opened with the mission to delight families from Berlin and the rest of Germany. In 2002, the family that owned the park (now known as Spreepark) moved six of the park’s attractions to Lima, Peru, where they tried to run another attraction. Open wide! Picture: Stachelbeer Source: Flickr \nYou were once able to take guided tours of the area, but that’s not been the case since the city of Berlin bought the park last year. Many attractions did stick around, including the Ferris wheel and a few roller coasters, which were put into retirement when the park closed. Path to nowhere. Picture: Rool Paap Source: Flickr \n2. Six Flags New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana \nHurricane Katrina had her hand in closing this young theme park - it was only open from 2000-2005. It was absolutely devastated. Picture: Eric Zeterberg Source: Flickr The storm devastated the area, flooding many sections. There was talk that Nickelodeon would revive it with a new park, but sadly, that deal never came to fruition. It’s now owned by the city of New Orleans and nobody is quite sure what the attraction (originally known as Jazzland) will become. A creepy clown. Picture: Keoni Cabral Source: Flickr \n3. Pod City, San Zhi, Taiwan \nThese retro-futuristic buildings were conceptualised and constructed in Taiwan in 1978. The goal for the resort was to attract US military stationed in East Asia after their official postings. \nThis dream never became a reality, as construction-related deaths and a lack of investment forced the owners to abandon it in 1980, never having hosted a single tourist. \nWe’d like to say the oversized M&M looking pods still exist, but unfortunately they were all demolished in 2010. There are plans in place to use the same area for a resort and we can only hope that the new resort will have more commercial success than the last! The Pod City.

This theme park, based on Jonathan Swift’s classic novel, is possibly the creepiest. \nIn it heyday, the park had all you could want in a Lilliputian theme park, except for one thing – visitors. It’s odd to think that people wouldn’t want to get a look at a 45 metre version of Lemuel Gulliver tied to the ground at the foot of Mount Fuji. \nPerhaps it has something more to do with its neighbours; Aokigahara, also known as the Suicide Forest, backs on to this abandoned attraction.

Wobbies World, Melbourne Wobbies! \nThe iconic amusement park operated from the 1970s to late 1990s in Nunawading, and was packed with slowly moving attractions aimed at children, such as a helicopter monorail circuit. It also had a mini-golf course, trampolines and a ball pit. Good old Wobbies World.
