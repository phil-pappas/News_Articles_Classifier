In partnership with the recently announced real estate subsidiary of sbe, Dakota Development, these newly conceptualized properties will offer exceptional guest experiences reopening in 2016.\nAs the most powerful nightlife operator in the market, sbe has been at the forefront of evolving conceptual venues that set cultural trends in the hospitality market with a focus on exceptional, forward-thinking design partnered with acclaimed service. The Dakota team, the award-winning development arm, will oversee the design and development of the properties in collaboration with Rockwell Group.\n\"Our approach at sbe has always been to place a high importance on delivering curated and quality experiences with an immense focus on collaborating with partners that match our creativity and eagerness to deliver world-class venues,\" said Sam Nazarian , sbe Founder, Chairman and CEO. \"We have built our reputation as a world-class leader, operating the most successful hospitality brands, and this re-concepting allows us to further evolve West Hollywood nightlife and restaurant culture.\"\nOperations will be led by Costas Charalambous, President sbe Nightlife Group, who adds \"We believe this next stage in reimagining these locations will offer the Los Angeles community dynamic and smartly conceptualized experiences.\"\nRockwell Group's redesign will begin with Mercato di Vetro, a two-story environment based on the European-influenced concept of an assemblage of rooms around a central courtyard, defined by a louver wall. The new design will allow for a dine and play atmosphere that will be reflected in the culinary vision for the property. The sequence of ground floor spaces, which includes lounges, a terrace, and a central bar, provides guests with different experiences. Guests can linger over small plates and wine in the terrace, sip cocktails at the bar or in one of three lounges, and experience the more lively lounge areas on the second floor. The space is set to be unveiled early spring 2016.\nThe second project will debut early winter 2016, as sbe's popular and beloved nightlife venue, Greystone Manor , is reimagined as an avant-garde cortile. The legendary nightlife venue that has been a top performer for sbe will offer new environments where guests can enjoy dinners and lounge, while still offering a central nightclub for that coveted entertainment and dance experience. From entry to dance floor, the nightclub will be a glamorous environment layered with a rich language of materials. With illuminated LED animation, graphic coverings inspired by exotic foliage and magical surrealism, soft banquettes in plush fabrics, and elements of marble and champagne metal, the nightclub will transport patrons into an electric and dynamic escape that offers transformative experiences room-to-room.\n\"We are excited to be leading this transformation of sbe's iconic venues that further drive the evolution of the nightlife landscape,\" said Dakota Development President Joe Faust . \"Rockwell Group is an exceptional partner with a forward thinking outlook on crafting experiences through design. We are thrilled to be working with them for our design collaboration.\"\n\"Our goal for Mercato di Vetro and Greystone Manor was to create multiple areas within each space to allow guests to choose his or her own experience,\" said David Rockwell , founder and President of Rockwell Group. \"Layers of sumptuous, highly textured, and beautifully crafted materials are revealed as guests move deeper into the spaces.\"\nFor more information on sbe and Dakota Development, please visit www.sbe.com and www.dakotadev.com .\nABOUT SBE:\nsbe is a creative hospitality company that develops, manages and operates award-winning hotels, restaurants and night clubs.
