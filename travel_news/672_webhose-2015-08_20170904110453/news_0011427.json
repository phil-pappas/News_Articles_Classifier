Sign In Here Commercial space travel in Central Florida is the next big frontier. Space Florida , the state agency charged with growing the state’s space industry, is close to a deal with Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and his company, Blue Origin, to build, assemble and launch rockets in Central Florida — a deal worth a reported $200 million in new investment and hundreds of jobs. Here, Dale Ketcham , chief of strategic alliances at Space Florida, shares more about new space business in Central Florida: What’s the progress on growing the local space industry? It’s not all going to launch from Florida, but we will see to it that we are the big dog and the primary gateway to the universe for launching into space from this planet. That includes NASA astronauts, military and commercial payloads, tourists and asteroid miners. Our goal is to keep Florida the unquestionable leader in space. How do you plan to draw space tourists? Our “We Are Go” campaign aims to attract more people to watch launches. We aren’t putting people into space as tourists yet or won’t be for at least five years, so it made sense to help another definition of space tourism and get people to come to Florida for a space-related reason. Will you be able to sustain launch tourism? Sure. Next year shows us launching every 10 days — the most robust since the 1950s. When will we have U.S. human space flights again? Probably about 2018. We are eager for Congress to fully fund the commercial crew program to get American astronauts to the International Space Station on American vehicles. We know it galls most Americans that we have to rely on Russian rockets to get Americans into space, but, trust us, it galls the hell out of us even more here on the Space Coast. We already are launching a scientific and commercial payloads, but it makes more of a point of where we are when you can have people in the pointy end of the rocket. How have you been fostering space partnerships with other countries? We have partnered with the international military science division of the Israeli government for joint aerospace research and development projects. We each put up $1 million to give to partnered research projects involving Florida- and Israeli-based companies. The U.S. money goes to U.S. companies and vice versa. This is the third year of it, and now we have more proposals than we have money. The proposals are coming from big U.S. companies like Lockheed Martin, Sanford Burnham and more looking to team up for some spiffy research. What’s Space Florida’s next challenge? Figuring out how to carve out a more commercially friendly environment in an area that traditionally has been controlled by NASA and the Air Force. Commercial companies want a place where they can best meet their customer demands quickly and with as much opportunity for innovation as possible. News ticker Universal Orlando revs up Fast & Furious attraction Universal Orlando Resort will get a new attraction based on the Fast & Furious film franchise in 2017. Details have yet to be released, but the attraction appears to encompass taking guests into the fast-paced, car-racing world surrounded by loads of action. To make room for the new experience, Universal will close Disaster: A Major Motion Picture Starring You! and the Beetlejuice Graveyard Revue by the end of this year. Orlando airport chooses south terminal architect Denver-based Fentress Architects will design the Orlando International Airport’s new south terminal. The project, which will cost $1.8 billion to build, now will enter the brainstorming phase to determine what natural Orlando-area features will be used in the final design. Fentress Architects is known for designing the Denver International Airport, which resembles the mountain ranges that comprise much of that region; and the Los Angeles International Airport, with a wavy design inspired by the large cascading waves iconic to L.A. and California. \nGet Orlando Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:27:40.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
