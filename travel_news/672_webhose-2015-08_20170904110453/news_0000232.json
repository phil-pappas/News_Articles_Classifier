Contributed The Perseids meteor shower, named because meteors appear to fall from a point in the constellation Perseus, is set to take place the night of Aug. 12.\nIn Miami Beach, Sense Beach House is offering guests its rooftop oasis to watch the falling stars from midnight and 2 a.m. on Aug. 12. The boutique hotel will enhance the show by serving Champagne to star watchers.\nBecause the hotel is on Ocean Drive far enough away from all the city lights in downtown Miami, it should be a good spot to view the show.\nSense Beach House is offering guests their rooftop oasis to watch the meteor shower on Aug. 12. The South Beach boutique hotel will be serving Champagne to make the night extra special.

The refuge is just off U.S. Highway 1 at mile marker 30.5 on Big Pine Key.\nAt Long Key State Park at mile marker 67.5, mangrove swamp, mudflat, rockland hammock, beach and coastal berm habitats are ripe for exploration.
