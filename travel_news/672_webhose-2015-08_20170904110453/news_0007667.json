You’ll discover world-class wines with complexity, concentration and length; refined comfort food (yes, toasted marshmallow ice cream really is sublime); and digs that make designs on houzz.com look drab. Think exposed beams, hardwood floors, deluxe linens, up-to-your-chin soaker tubs, rain showerheads and state-of-the-art coffee makers. Beware, the trip might actually make you forget to check your email.\nThe best part is that the prices are reasonable.\nDay 1\nIf you arrive mid-day, you can start with a visit to The Grange of Prince Edward Vineyards and Estate. Taste several sterling wines in the barn ($5/four samples), including the dangerously delicious 2011 Gamay Noir ($20.95/bottle) and lime-sorbet-scented 2012 Estate Riesling ($15.95/bottle). Then, enjoy a farm-packed picnic and saunter toward the vineyards, glass in hand.\nCarry on to Closson Chase for some terroir-driven expressions of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir in the garden ($10 for three samples).\nNext, head to The Old Third to toast the afternoon with the 2011 Pinot Noir Sparkling À la Volée ($3/sample, $59/bottle). It tastes like fine French vintage Champagne and is one of Canada’s finest wines. If you’re peckish, stay for a crepe.\nTwenty minutes east, you’ll find Angeline’s. A Victorian mansion of suites, a retro-chic motor inn, and three cottages dot the property. Book early for The Babylon, a refurbished log cabin from the 1860s ($119 to $349/night).\nFor dinner, head to at the Drake Devonshire and dine on the deck of this lakeside, rural-hip interpretation of farmhouse. Dinner for two with wine is about $200.\nDay 2\nBegin your day at the Tall Poppy Café for a better-than-Starbucks coffee and legendary egg-cheddar-peameal-tomato sandwich called The Bob.\nThen, it’s off to Huff Estates where winemaker Frédéric Picard makes stellar juice—tasting room opens at 10 a.m. Don’t miss the 2013 Rosé Cabernet Franc ($19/bottle) and 2012 South Bay Vineyard Unfiltered Merlot ($40/bottle). You’ll think you died and went to France. Amble through the on-site art gallery and sculpture garden.\nNext stop: Norman Hardie Winery. Norman’s wines are flat-out fabulous so head straight to the tasting bar and begin with the 2014 Calcaire, a thrilling white ($23/bottle) and go from there. Afterward, stay for a wood-fired pizza on the patio.\nNip over to Karlo Estates winery to try new wines made with Hockey Hall of Famer Doug Gilmour. Then, work on your 10,000 steps, walking to North America’s largest dry stone bridge at the far end of the vineyard.\nBefore heading home, refresh with an ice cream treat from Slickers — the toasted marshmallow is nostalgically delicious. Or saddle up to the bar at Pomodoro for killer meatballs ($2 each) and a refreshing glass of Sandbanks 2014 Pinot Noir Rosé ($7).\nBest part about this trip to the county? It might actually make you forget to check your email.\nFast Facts\nTasting fees are usually waived with a bottle purchase\nOnly wines labeled VQA PEC are made from fruit grown in the County; VQA Ontario means the fruit can come from anywhere in the province.\nCarolyn Evans Hammond is a Toronto-based wine writer.
