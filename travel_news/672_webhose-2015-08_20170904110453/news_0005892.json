U&I Holidays also saw great interest in new products and areas. \nSondhi said that Indonesia expected 20 million tourists by 2020, up from the 9.4 million in 2014. \nThe issue of direct flights between India and Indonesia is still hanging fire, although there is hope of progress now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:00:57.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
