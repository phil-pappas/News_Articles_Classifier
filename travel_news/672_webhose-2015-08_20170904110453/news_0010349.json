He pointed to the large pueblo settlement near Pojoaque Pueblo that dates between 850 and 1150. \"It is one of the early pueblos where Native Americans began to live together in architecturally sophisticated buildings,\" he said.\nPojoaque Pueblo residents are direct descendants of those who lived at K'uuyemugeh more than 1,000 years ago. The settlement was made up of a collection of buildings of staked poles covered in adobe, buildings made of sandstone slabs and stone structures mortared with adobe.\nThe settlement was also home to one of the region's earliest kivas, where puebloan ancestors would gather for religious and ceremonial purposes. Archaeology at the site has revealed unusual ceremonial animal burials, indicating the site's importance as a religious centre.\nThe Los Alamos post office is not much different from when it was built in 1946 as part of a multimillion-dollar civic complex funded by the Atomic Energy Commission to replace wartime housing used by people working on the top-secret bomb-making project.\nThe architect, W.C. Kruger, also designed the state capitol building in Santa Fe.\nOther New Mexico sites added to the national register this month include the campus of St. John's College, the oldest bridge designed for motor vehicle traffic in Santa Fe, a flight station in Grants that provided radio communications and weather data for transcontinental flights and the Gutierrez-Hubbell House in Albuquerque, which was once an important stop along El Camino Real.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:44:35.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
