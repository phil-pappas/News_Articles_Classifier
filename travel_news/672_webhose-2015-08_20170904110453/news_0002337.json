This three-year-old vessel, with all oversized staterooms and private balconies, will more than double the capacity on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The line’s brand new riverboat America will replace the \"Queen of the Mississippi\" on the Mississippi River in early 2016. \nThe repositioning of this riverboat to the Pacific Northwest and the introduction of the new 185-passenger paddlewheeler \"America\" to the Mississippi River will enable American Cruise Lines to meet the high demands for cruising on the Columbia and Snake Rivers and provide more capacity on the Mississippi River system. This new Columbia River paddlewheeler features the largest, most well-appointed staterooms on the river with large sliding glass doors opening to private balconies. The glass-enclosed dining room comfortably accommodates all guests in one seating and seven spacious lounges throughout the ship offer areas for entertainment, relaxation and conversation. While on board the guests learn about the Pacific Northwest history and culture, while enjoying the finest in personalized service. \nThe new paddlewheeler \"America\" is scheduled to be launched this week in Salisbury, MD, and will be moved to its East Outfitting Basin for completion of the upper decks and final outfitting. A new \"Queen of the Mississippi\" is also under construction at Chesapeake Shipbuilding. These new riverboats for American Cruise Lines will be the finest Mississippi paddlewheelers ever built, introducing features never before seen on a riverboat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:39:38.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
