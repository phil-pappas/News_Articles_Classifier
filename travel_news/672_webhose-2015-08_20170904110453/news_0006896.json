Man Misses Flight After Female Security Refuse To Frisk Him CBC Updated: 4 hours ago reddit ADVERTISEMENT \nA retired social worker from B.C. was prevented from boarding his flight when his artificial hip set off the metal detector at airport security and the all-female security crew refused to frisk him. \nRobert Hart was blocked from boarding his Air Canada flight on July 26 while he was on his way to a family wedding in Ontario. \nIt's not the first time he has flown and he knew his artificial hip would set off the metal detector, but it is the first time he wasn't allowed to fly. Hart and his wife checked in at the Northwest Regional Airport near their home in Terrace, B.C. \n\"I smiled at the ... lady who was holding her [security] wand,\" he said, adding that he told the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) employees he had an artificial metal hip. \n\"And the words that came out of her mouth were, 'You're not going to be able to board this flight. You can't take this flight. You have to be patted down by male CATSA staff and one is not available.'\" \nHart asked security staff to contact their supervisor and he says he also offered to be patted down by a female CATSA screener, a male Air Canada agent or an RCMP officer. \n\"I said, 'What can we do here?' And [the CATSA screener] said, 'I'm sorry you're just going to have to book another flight. We're not prepared to negotiate at all on that.'\" \nHart says he was told the small airport's CATSA crew had only two male screeners, one of whom was on holiday and the other was off duty. He was asked to come back when a male CATSA agent would be on duty, and as a result, his trip was delayed by nine hours. \n\"It was just so stunning,\" he said. \"I couldn't believe this was happening.\" \nCATSA apologizes \nThe Canadian Air Transport Security Authority website states that \"a physical search is always done by a screening officer of the same gender as the passenger.\" \nBut CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque says there are exceptions and says Hart should have been allowed to board his flight. \n\"I can't disclose these procedures specifically, but there are procedures to have passengers screened when there are no same sex officers,\" he told CBC News. \n\"We will apologize because it was our mistake. [Hart] should have been screened, he should have been able to get on that plane.\" \nLarocque says the agency is now ensuring CATSA staff in Terrace and across the country are aware of these exceptions \"so a similar situation does not occur again.\" \nHart has accepted CATSA's apology, but he says he's still worried about overly zealous security keeping Canadians grounded. Most Annoying Airport Security Checkpoints (PHOTOS) of   See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsLAX is plagued by a number of issues that can slow security, from celebrities who feel they can flaunt the rules to a huge volume of international travelers (roughly 25 percent). But one of the most alarming trends is the smuggling of contraband items past security: everything from a guy with live snakes down his pants to 40,000 tabs of counterfeit Viagra.Photo: Anthony Dunn / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsOne of the smallest major airports, LaGuardia was not designed to accommodate a sprawling 21st-century security apparatus. But here's a bit of encouraging news: X-ray body scanners at LGA (and JFK) are being replaced by millimeter wave scanners that work faster and should speed up the security process. Still, an ongoing beef is security personnel who are too \"hands on.\" Urban planner Nancy Campbell is among those allegedly groped. \"If I had been physically attacked,\" she told the local press after her 2011 close encounter of the TSA kind, \"this would have been a very, very similar experience.\"Photo: Mario Tama / Getty Images See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsIn early 2012, eight TSA screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport were fired for sleeping on the job and other work-related violations. And in October, improper screening of baggage spurred the TSA to announce plans to fire 25 employees and suspend another 19. The airport has also been plagued by security lapses -- allowing unscreened or uncleared passengers onto the airside -- that have led to terminal closures and severe flight delays.Photo: Martin Shields / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsThey may not be sleeping on the job, but a TSA agent at Philadelphia's airport found another way to alleviate workplace boredom -- and tarnish the staff's reputation. In 2010, as a college student passed through security, a security agent confronted her, claiming he'd found a baggie filled with a white substance inside her carry-on. When she panicked, the screener (who was later fired) admitted he was \"just kidding.\"Photo: Jenny / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsIt takes longer to get through the security and check-in processes when traveling abroad, so get to the airport early -- especially at JFK. With more than 23 million international travelers each year, the airport is the biggest international gateway in North America. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel (or rather queue). Terminal 6, long vilified for the worst security lines, was demolished in 2011 to make way for a modern airport expansion. And plans were approved in summer 2012 for an expansion of JetBlue's Terminal 5 to accommodate more international flights.Photo: dbimages / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsO'Hare is plagued by complaints that the new PreCheck security clearance (started in March 2012) isn't working as well as intended. Passengers vetted and cleared for the program complained they haven't been allowed to join the express line even after their boarding passes were scanned. This appears to be largely an airline rather than TSA problem. Computer glitches and inconsistencies in passenger information (like using a middle initial instead of a full middle name) are among reasons given for the snags.Photo: Tim Boyle / Getty Images See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsIf you think taking candy from a baby is going to cause a ruckus, wait until a TSA agent at Orlando International snatches the snow globe your kid just got at Disney World or Universal Studios. Snow globes contain liquid, and sometimes more than three ounces. Confiscations have happened at security checkpoints enough times to be one of MCO's main passenger complaints. Tremendous holiday period traffic and a terminal designed so that everyone is funneled through just two security checkpoints only aggravate the process.Photo: Jeff Greenberg / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsAs LAX has its celebrities, so Washington Dulles has politicians and diplomats, some with a sense of entitlement that can inconvenience other fliers. The most publicized incident came in 2009 when David Vitter, the Republican senator from Louisiana, was allegedly rude to airline staff and set off a security alarm when he tried to open a security door in his rush to catch a United Airlines flight.Photo: Jeff Greenberg / Alamy See More of the Most Annoying Airport Security CheckpointsA new \"behavior detection\" program at Logan Airport went wrong in August 2012 when eight TSA officers were accused of racially profiling -- claims backed up by fellow security agents in interviews with The New York Times. Instead of uncovering would-be terrorists, the officers allegedly targeted blacks, Asians and Hispanics for extra screening -- often based on what they were wearing rather than how they were acting -- in the belief that stopping and searching such passengers would detect more illegal drugs, outstanding warrants and illegal immigrants.

With around 150 flights departing each day, Alaska Airlines is far and away the airport's No. 1 carrier. During the morning hubbing rush hour, the security checkpoints for Concourses A, C and N (where most of the Alaska Airlines flights arrive and depart) can bottleneck quickly.
