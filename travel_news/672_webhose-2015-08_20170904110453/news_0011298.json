To dispel suspicions that the image had been Photoshopped, she posted two videos to YouTube. The videos went viral, making her the darling of meme-loving macro-makers everywhere. \nIn step with Grumpy Cat’s digital celebrity, her figure will be an animatronic with five different movements. The animatronic will be unveiled at Madame Tussauds’ San Francisco location later this year in typically aloof fashion by Grumpy Cat herself. After a short stay at Madame Tussauds San Francisco, the animatronic will tour the remaining five Madame Tussauds attractions across the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:07:40.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
