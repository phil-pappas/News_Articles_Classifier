It also provides guidance for operators when identifying CRS for use on board an aircraft, recommended content of relevant policies, procedures, and training programmes, as well as guidelines for managing change through their safety management systems (SMS) to allow the use of CRS on board their aircraft.\n“Proper use of occupant restraints is one of the most basic and important factors in surviving an accident. It is not possible for a parent to physically restrain an infant or child, especially during sudden accelerations and/or decelerations, unanticipated or severe turbulence or during impact,” stressed ICAO Council President, Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu. “The use of CRS provides an equivalent level of safety to infants and children as that afforded to adult passengers wearing seat belts.”\nDoc 10049 will facilitate the widespread use of CRS globally, providing guidance related to requirements for seats and restraints found in Annex 6 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation.\nThe new recommendations were developed by the ICAO Cabin Safety Group, featuring inputs from experts from civil aviation authorities, airlines, aircraft manufacturers, training organizations and international organizations. The provisions were then submitted for an extensive peer review to collect and take into account comments from further experts in the field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:11:18.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
