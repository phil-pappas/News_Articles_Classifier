You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Luis Ascenso/Flickr \n…Isle of Skye! If Scotland is on your bucket list, this location is must-see. It's one of the most beautiful spots in an immensely beautiful country. To get the most out of your trip, rent a car or hire a driver to explore all this gorgeous island has to offer. Be sure to hike the Cuillin Ridge, find a Broch (iron structures found only in Scotland that date back 2000 years), camp in the wild, go horseback riding, witness an epic sunrise over the Quiraing, visit the seals sun bathing on the rocks in Loch Dunvegan, go whale watching, shoot some paintballs, or go cliff jumping. If you visit in winter, you might even be able to see t he Aurora Borealis! The list of things to do on this incredible island is pretty much endless. Kind of like the rolling green land pictured above. Tumblr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:45:30.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
