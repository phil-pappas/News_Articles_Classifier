They had set off from the UK in their small motorhome, intending to explore France for about three weeks. That was a year before – and they still hadn’t gone home. Their example may be the most extreme but they certainly weren’t the first people I had met on my travels who had succumbed to the lure of the open road. As a child, my family had a static caravan next to a canal where I fished and kayaked. A friend’s parents had a touring caravan in which I spent the occasional weekend, playing cricket and throwing frisbees on various campgrounds around the UK. The bug has never left me, especially now I know several couples with motorhomes or campervans who take off at short notice for a weekend, a week, a month or more. Several times on my travels I’ve found myself glancing enviously at campers sitting in the sunshine outside their motorhomes As my friend Gwen, who has a rather smart motorhome, told me: “If the weather is not looking great in England, we drive down to the ferry port, hop over to France and keep going south until we find the sunshine.” Armed with a few essentials, maps and a book listing European campsites, they usually have no set plan. Another couple I know use their motorhome and spacious awning to take their grandchildren away for two weeks in the school summer holidays to a site equipped with swimming pools and playgrounds – “doing their duty”, as they put it. The rest of time is theirs. They often head to Scotland in the summer and Portugal in the autumn, letting their mood dictate the pace and the places. I don’t blame them. Several times on my travels I’ve found myself glancing enviously at campers sitting in the sunshine outside their motorhomes, enjoying the fresh air, just a hop and a step from the beach. I’ve long realised that the beauty of owning a caravan, campervan or motorhome is that it gives you to freedom to roam for as long as you like and, within reason, almost where you like. Many who have retired early, or are taking an extended break from work, are following their dream; to set off with the rest of their book of life consisting of blank pages, waiting to be filled however they like. And very soon, it will be my turn. Life's a beach: many people take an extended break from work to follow their dream I’m looking at buying a compact campervan that can negotiate the smallest roads – those that will take me off the beaten tourist path. I’ll start off with a few long weekends away in the UK – Devon and Pembrokeshire are top of my list – then venture further afield to Europe. Personally, I like the idea of having a purpose to an extended tour. I fancy heading down to Burgundy for a slow sojourn among the vineyards, finishing up on the sunny French Riviera. Another trip I’m planning will involve hopping between the fairytale castles of Germany. With many campsites having Wi-Fi, I’ll be able to plan each journey as I go along and can change my mind as often as I like. It’s that last factor that appeals most to me. If I find myself camping in a meadow beside a river, I’ll stay for a week. If I lose my bearings and end up opposite an industrial estate, I’ll simply move on the next morning. The big trip, though, is one I’ve wanted to do ever since I can remember. I intend to drive all the way round the coast of Spain and Portugal, meandering through the Pyrenees to link the Mediterranean and Atlantic. I’ll travel anti-clockwise, always taking the road closest to the coast (driving on the right will mean easy turn-offs to the beaches). I will pass through the popular resorts, seeking out those secret places that are usually overlooked by the package crowds. Having said that, extended stopovers at Lisbon, Barcelona and Santander will be very much part of the plan. No doubt I’ll pick up lots of tips and advice from fellow travellers – I’ve always found campers and caravanners to be a friendly lot and happy to share their experiences. I envisage the trip will take at least four months, but I could make it last a year. That’s my dream, what’s yours? • Visit freedomtogo.co.uk to find the perfect vehicle in which to live your dreams.
