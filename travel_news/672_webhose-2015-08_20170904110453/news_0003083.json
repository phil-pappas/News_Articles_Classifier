So if you happen to be within two hours, it’s worth considering. Also, the trails are polluted with horse and mule feces. I found myself on the canyon edge dangerously jumping and shifting around to avoid it.\" \n\"Seeing the canyon in person is about as good as seeing pictures of the canyon. It’s possible the pictures might be better since the photographer only releases the most interesting views of the park.” \n“I have been lucky enough to remember the spectacular beauty from 30 years ago when it was not spoiled by tourist centers, souvenir shops and other spots of ...civilisation.” Picture: AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:23:21.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
