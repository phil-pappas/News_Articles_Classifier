The product, called \"Edmunds Express,\" was designed with direct input from dealers to help them build trust with customers and close deals faster, all while fitting seamlessly into the sales process.\nEdmunds Express gives dealers access to Edmunds' True Market Value® (TMV®) reports directly from a salesperson's desktop. With one click, dealers can access a specific piece of inventory in stock and share its specs and information, including the TMV® price of the vehicle and current available customer cash incentives. The TMV® report can be easily shared electronically or in person with skeptical shoppers to confirm that a dealer's offer is, in fact, a fair deal.\n\"Our dealer partners told us that they love using the data on our site because their customers trust our information, but when they're working with buyers on the phone or in person, they quickly need that information without navigating through our website each time,\" said Edmunds.com President Seth Berkowitz . \"Edmunds Express solves this problem. It's a straightforward sales tool that features Edmunds' most relevant pricing and data so that both dealers and shoppers can proceed with an easy, productive transaction.\"\nIn addition to TMV® reports, Edmunds Express gives dealers easier access to Edmunds' trade-in appraisal and vehicle comparison tools. The appraisal tool provides Edmunds' dealer trade-in value and can be a useful start toward validating a dealer's trade-in offer to the customer. Meanwhile, the vehicle comparison tool lets dealers more easily showcase the specific benefits of the vehicles on their lot using Edmunds' trusted, third-party data.\nEdmunds Express is a web-based tool with customized URLs assigned to individual dealerships. Dealership employees are encouraged to bookmark the page and access vehicle information simply by typing a VIN or stock number.\n\"We've found that many of our highest quality shoppers trust Edmunds and they are often armed with Edmunds information even before they step foot in our showroom,\" said Dustan Turner , marketing director at Prime Motor Group in New England.\nEdmunds Express is a complimentary value-add for each of Edmunds' network of over 10,000 trusted dealer partners.
