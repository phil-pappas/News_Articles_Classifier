One, free of charge. Size : 55cm x 40cm x 20cm. Trunki’s rolling suitcases are acceptable for children. Weight : 6kg Can I book a hold bag on a single leg, and travel hand-luggage only on the other? It's complicated. The Thomas Cook \"FlexibleTrips\" tickets allow passengers the option of booking hold luggage on specific legs of a trip, whereas Thomas Cook \"Style Collection\" offerings have hold luggage included and no discount will be given for not travelling with hold luggage on one leg of a trip. Am I allowed any items in addition to my one cabin bag? In addition to the one 6kg bag, passengers may carry one of the following items in the cabin with them: one laptop, one overcoat or one blanket, one small ladies handbag or one small wrist-bag or one small bag with shoulder strap; one umbrella, one small camera and/or one pair of binoculars, assisted devices for those with disabilities, a \"reasonable amount\" of reading material for the flight, duty free items purchased at the airport beyond security checks, or as a pre-order from the operating carrier; infants' food for consumption during the flight.
