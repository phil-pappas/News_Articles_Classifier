Today, with Jet Airways, we have 21 per cent of the market, and combined, we are the dominant carriers out of India.\n“Jet Airways is now our number one equity partner for revenue and passenger contribution on Etihad Airways. India is now Abu Dhabi’s number one source market for international visitors.”\nLast year, Etihad said it aimed to make Jet Airways profitable in three years. The turnaround plan included a range of “critical measures” such as long-term network, fleet and product developments to “optimise the airline’s domestic and international operations”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-17T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T12:32:04.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
