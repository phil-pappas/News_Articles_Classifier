His country abolished capital punishment in 1979.\nOrtega asked U.S. President Barack Obama to intercede and stop the death penalty for humanitarian reasons, calling execution for a crime committed as a minor a “cruel and unusual punishment” in a letter to Obama.\nBut the U.S. president has few powers to stay a state’s execution.\n“I never lost my faith, and my hope that my God should be the only one to take a life,” Tercero’s mother, Lídia, said in tears in her home in Posoltega, Nicaragua, alongside the spared man’s only child.\nTercero was to have been executed for the murder of high school English teacher Robert Berger in front of Berger’s three-year-old daughter, while robbing a Houston dry cleaning business.\nBerger was arrested in Nicaragua and returned to the United States in 1999 before his 2000 death sentence.\nTexas authorities say Tercero committed a brutal murder and he is subject to the laws of the state.\n“When anyone commits a crime in Texas, they are subject to Texas law,” said Texas governor press secretary John Wittman.", "external_links": ["http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/091.asp"], "published": "2015-08-26T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:46:05.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
