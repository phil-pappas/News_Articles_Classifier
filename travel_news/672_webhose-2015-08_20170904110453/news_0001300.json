Yoga has never been an activity that made its way to the top of my to-do list. As for yoga done in a steaming-hot studio? That wasn’t even on the first page. So when I agreed to give it a go, it was with some level of reluctance. I had heard hot yoga, also known as Bikram yoga, described as difficult and ugly – and you can see from the pictures of my experience that the description was fitting. Yes, it was tough and it certainly wasn’t pretty - but it might just be the making of me. My muscles, and joints, and everything come to that, have never wanted to move very far The theory makes complete sense. Sauna-like temperatures – it was about 37C in my class – warm the muscles and make them easier to move and stretch. It’s just that my muscles, and joints, and everything come to that, have never wanted to move or stretch very far. I’ve been able to touch my toes for only about five years – and those were my first five years. For the last 45 I’ve not been able to get beyond about halfway down my shins. My back is stiff, my hamstrings short and tight, my hip flexors don’t flex much. All of which is not helped by years of sitting, often slouching, in front of a computer. Reluctant: our Bikram newbie hasn't been able to touch his toes since he was a child (Photo: Philip Haynes 2015) “Like a lot of men, you’ve had a lifetime of restricted or limited movement patterns,” says Jemma Smith, owner of Present , a hot yoga studio in Tunbridge Wells. “Men are also much less likely to spend time stretching, even if they are active. Many activities and sports that men don can cause muscles to become even tighter, restricting range of movement even further. I believe this is why we are starting to see more men in their fifties taking up yoga.” Jemma reckons 15 per cent of her customers are men, many coming to her popular 8-9pm classes after work. And she has 26 men in their fifties on her books. Making progress: David rearranges his resilient limbs (Photo: Philip Haynes 2015) Before my class I speak to Phil, a builder who like me recently turned 50. He’s been going to hot yoga for nearly a year. “I loved it straight away,” says Phil, a keen runner. “It’s not just your body. I mean, I’m doing some stretches I couldn’t do before, but it does really help you in yourself as well. Oh, and take a towel, or two. It’s like the runway in Dubai at midday.” Phil was right. Although I’d have to say that the yoga was harder than the heat. I did a Vinyasa Flow class, which Present’s website does say is “dynamic in style, giving a more cardiovascular workout”. It did that all right. There were a few positions I struggled to get into – the big stride forward from the downward dog, for example, was never going to happen – and the heat and the workout did begin to get to me after about 40 minutes, when I had to stop briefly for a drip and a breather. Warming to it: David takes a much-needed breather but he's not deterred! (Photo: Philip Haynes 2015) But the thought that, with some perseverance, I could one day bend it like my eight female classmates (who were amazing in what they could do) was hugely encouraging. “It normally takes about three classes to really start feeling the benefits,” says Jemma. Walking out from the heat to the relative cool of a summer day was one immediate benefit. It was lovely. The longer-term advantages of flexibility and wellbeing would be nice, too. So toes, be warned. I’m coming after you.
