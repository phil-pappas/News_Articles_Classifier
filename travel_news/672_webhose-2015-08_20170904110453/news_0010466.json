He'd been walking across a street in Rome, a travel bag slung casually over his shoulder, two men on a scooter came past him, the pillion passenger deftly removed the travel bag from his shoulder, and they disappeared into the Never Never with it. \nThe travel bag, of course, contained my colleague's credit cards, passport, and all other essentials, and his time in Rome was not spent in the city's famous art galleries and churches, but in banks and embassies as he scrambled for new documents and funds. \nIt was the classic holiday accident, and it goes to show that travel is full of heart-stopping moments, not all of which are about ogling scenic wonders. Sometimes it's about coping with near disaster in an unfamiliar place, and an unfamiliar language, and I share here the story of my own Italian heart-stopping moment. Not the one about seeing an Apennine brown bear in the wild in Majella National Park (at a safe distance - it was amazing), but the one that concerns my Holy Trinity of Travel, namely my passport, credit card and cellphone. Without them, you're kind of sunk. \nI guard the Holy Trinity (no irreverence intended) assiduously, each one has a permanent position in my travel bag, which is worn safely cross-body rather slung-over-shoulder. So how was it a few weeks ago that I left one of the Holy Trinity, my cellphone, on a seat at the Blue Line ferry terminal in the Italian port of Ancona? \nIt still give me the heebies. My friend and fellow traveller Venetia Sherson and I were sitting on some bright blue wooden seats outside the Blue Line terminal in Ancona, waiting to catch an overnight ferry to Split, in Croatia. In an idle moment, I checked my phone, and I must have put it down on the seat rather than back in its assigned place in my bag. I didn't discover its loss until an hour or so later, when I was unpacking in a ferry cabin, and checked on the Holy Trinity. \nOh my God, I said to Venetia, I can't find my phone. I spilled the contents of my bag on to the bunk, frantically went through all of the side-pockets. Again, and again. No go, no phone, it must be on Blue Line's blue seats, now vividly imprinted on my mind, or maybe it had been picked up and pocketed by the next person who sat on the blue seats. \nMy life is in my phone, it has my photos, and all my contacts with the people, places and information of utmost importance. Venetia stayed calm, suggested that we may have time to get back to the terminal to find the phone before the ferry left port. We still had an hour or so to go. \nI went up to the ship's reception, explained the loss, and asked how I could contact the terminal. Reception was initially unhelpful, but eventually I got to speak to the Chief Purser, a born problem-solver, and a deeply understanding man. He observed my desperation, and said he would call Mr Claudio, the ferry terminal manager. (I didn't think to ask how Mr Claudio actually spelled his name, so this is the best I can do). \nThe Chief Purser, whose name was Joseph, was probably Croatian, Mr Claudio was probably Italian, and they spoke for some time on the Chief Purser's mobile in what was probably a mixture of Italian and Croatian. Then the Chief Purser handed his mobile to me. He said Mr Claudio would speak to me in English, so I told the story again about leaving my phone on the blue seats. Mr Claudio said he'd have a look for it. There was a long silence, then he came back on the line and spoke the best four words I'd heard all day: \"Is it a Samsung?\" He had found my phone. \nI described it fully, he was clearly satisfied that it was mine. I asked Mr Claudio if he thought I had time to get from the ship to the terminal (maybe 1km or more away) to retrieve the phone before sailing. If not, I figured I'd have to go to Croatia without it, and pick it up on the way back. Ad Feedback \nNeither of these things was necessary, because the helpfulness of the Chief Purser and Mr Claudio continued. They spoke to each other again, and the Chief Purser reported that Mr Claudio would send my phone to the ship at 8.15pm with the official Italian embarkation documents. It would be no problem. I thanked Mr Claudio and the Chief Purser many times over, told them they were wonderful men, and then Venetia and I went to the bar to have a couple of stiff drinks while we waited for 8.15 to roll around. \nI was back at reception just in time to see a large brown envelope being delivered by a man in a uniform. The Chief Purser opened it, and there among the embarkation documents was a little package containing my silver Samsung. \nIt was a happy ending to a potentially bad new travel story. The missing part of the Holy Trinity was restored to its designated place, my handbag, and the Chief Purser seemed satisfied with the outcome. Although I think he was quite pleased that there was a solid reception counter between him and me when I said I'd like to hug him. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T00:02:09.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
