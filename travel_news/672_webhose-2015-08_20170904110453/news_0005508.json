Households get cash subsidy in their bank accounts to make good the difference between old subsidised rate and market price.\n“We brought DBTL and took advantage of bank accounts opened under Jan Dhan Scheme and Aadhaar numbers to give subsidy straight to consumers,” Modi said.\nDBTL has stopped diversions of “about Rs 15,000 crore of LPG every year,” he said.\nOut of 15.65 crore active domestic LPG consumers, 13.8 crore have joined the DBTL and are getting subsidy in their bank accounts.\nThe scheme was launched in 54 districts on November 15, 2014, and extended to all over the country from January 1, 2015 with a view to cut diversion and subsidised fuel being consumed by unintended segments like restaurants and other commercial establishments.\nLPG subsidy payout from Union Budget in 2014-15 was Rs 40,591 crore as against a dole of Rs 52,231 crore in 2013-14, a saving of Rs 11,640 crore.\nModi said he had requested the well-off people who can afford to pay market price, to voluntarily give up their subsidy to help extend its reach to the most needy.\n“20 lakh people have given up LPG subsidy voluntarily,” he said. Middle class families and teachers are among the people who have left subsidy.\nAssuming that each of these consume an average of 8 cylinders per annum and at the average subsidy rate of Rs 200 per bottle, the saving amounts to about Rs 320 crore.\nPresently, a household is entitled to receive subsidy to buy up to 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg each every year. Cash advance is transfered into the beneficiary account on first enrollment and another installment is given the moment it is used to buy a LPG refill.\n 15, 2015 9:38 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:18:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
