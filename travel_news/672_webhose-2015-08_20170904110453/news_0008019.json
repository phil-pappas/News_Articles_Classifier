They will be sold by Cuba Travel Services.\nAmericans still must meet certain requirements for travel to Cuba, such as visiting family. Trips that are strictly for tourism are not yet legal.\nAmerican has operated charters to Cuba since 1991 and now flies there about 20 times a week from Miami and Tampa, Florida. Senior Vice-President Art Torno said the airline is ready to offer scheduled flights as soon as that is allowed.\nInterest in travel to Cuba seems to have increased as the Obama administration has moved to restore diplomatic relations. In July, JetBlue Airways began weekly charters between New York and Havana.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:58:37.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
