Behaving like a Neanderthal may not be ideal in meetings - but according to the team behind Wildfitness holidays on the Isle of Wight, it’s essential if you want to recover optimum health and happiness. The three-day courses are held at NorthCourt, an old manor house in the midst of the island’s Downs and close to the unspoilt beaches. Unlike fitness bootcamps , here the focus is on getting back in touch with your natural abilities to move, run, carry and jump. All the things that came naturally as a child can be left behind as we slump from desk to car to TV, and Wildfitness is all about getting that feeling of energy and optimism back. The course features food as much as fitness, and involves workshops on how our bodies have evolved and seasonal cooking. But should you be concerned it all sounds a bit Ab Fab , there’s no drumming circles or sweat lodges here. Day one of the “Energiser” course is an early-morning run over the Downs, followed later by circuits in the meadow, a lunch of fish and wild greens, an intense boxing workout in the woods and then candlelit dinner at the manor. The whole experience is designed to remind you what your body is capable of and what helps it to perform better The second day focuses on joints and loosening up; there’s optional massage, and lifting and carrying-focused exercises. Then day three has everyone down at the beach, crawling, running and jumping. The whole experience is designed to remind you what your body is capable of and what helps it to perform better - fresh, natural food, movement, short bursts of intensive training and plenty of discussion to assess your personal needs and issues when it comes to fitness. The holiday is designed around “wild living”, the idea that our ancestors listened to the rhythms of their bodies, knew when to eat, how to nourish themselves, and how to move without injury. Recapturing that means you can give your body what it needs, rather than fighting its natural inclinations. The setting is idyllic, too, and the course maximises outdoor activity, with time spent in the woods, on the beach and on the Downs. Meals are communal and include a barbecue and a class with the chef on “wild eating”, showing you how to cook grains, fruit and vegetables, meat and seafood for maximum taste and nutrition. With the emphasis on transformation, it’s entirely likely you’ll return feeling 10 years younger. It’s the ideal re-introduction to the fitness you feel you’ve lost with an eye on your mental health, too. Besides, any fitness weekend whose philosophy begins “chilling out is the most important thing you can do to improve your health” has to be worth a try.
