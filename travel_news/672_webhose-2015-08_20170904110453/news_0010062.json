It has served a strategic body of water for the Roman and Ottoman Empires alike, and remains a major shipping and trade port. The Bosphorus cruise starts out by passing under the famous Galata Bridge, where you’ll get great views of the city including the Galata Tower, historic Topkapi Palace and countless mosques. Along the cruise our local guide helped point out many other landmarks as well, like the modern art museum and beautiful Dolmabahce Palace . As we headed towards the Bosphorus Bridge, you can take in all the sites and sounds of the seaside neighborhoods like Besiktas, Bebek and Ortakoy… And on the return, we floated along the Asian side where you’ll see traditional Ottoman homes, and the iconic Maiden Tower.
