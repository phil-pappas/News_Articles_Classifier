Transport linkages are crucial for regional development and these new air linkages will help boost business and tourism traffic into regions like Taranaki, Hawke’s Bay, Nelson and Manawatu/Whanganui,\" Mr Joyce says. \n\"I know it’s been a very competitive process between the different regions for the opportunity to host the new carrier. I'm confident that this expansion of regional routes will be successful and lead to more competition on regional routes in the future. Competitive air travel into regional New Zealand will help share the benefits of economic development and tourism around the country.\" \n“Today’s announcement is great news for consumers,” says Mr Bridges. “As we have seen in recent years, competition between Air New Zealand and Jetstar has ensured passengers travelling on main-trunk routes have had access to lower fares and more choice. So this announcement means new services will bring these same benefits to regional communities throughout New Zealand.” \n“Today’s announcement from Jetstar is just one of a number of new international and regional air services announced in recent months. These new services are a real vote of confidence in our aviation sector and the future prospects of regional New Zealand.” Mr Bridges says. \nJetstar will begin offering the services from December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T01:57:02.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
