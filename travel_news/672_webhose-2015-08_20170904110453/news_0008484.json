His opening goal on the run from outside 50 was electric and he celebrated with another dance to lift the SCG crowd to their feet. He finished the day with 22 disposals seven marks.\nSydney Swans player Lewis Jetta performed a dance after booting the first goal of the game. Source: AAP\nThe Swans midfielders had a field day as they hit back to totally dominated possession (461-333).\nDan Hannebery led the way with another eyecatching display, finishing with a game-high 40 disposals and three goals.\nThe Swans had nine different goalscorers and six players with 30-plus disposals: Jarrad McVeigh (37), Luke Parker (30), Josh Kennedy (32), Dane Rampe (32) and Tom Mitchell (35).\nKieren Jack was also outstanding and had a hand in no less than nine scoring assists - the second-highest in AFL history behind Geelong champion Steve Johnson (11).\nKurt Tippett and Lance Franklin made an instant impact in their return from injury with three goals each.\nSydney Swans' Kurt Tippett booted three goals in the first game against his old side Adelaide. Source: AAP\nTippett played one of his best games for the Swans, going toe-to-toe with one of the best ruckmen in the league in Sam Jacobs then going forward to provide a target. He produced the form which could have a big impact for Sydney in the finals.\nThe Swans reclaimed their spot in the top four, which they temporarily lost to Richmond after their upset win over Hawthorn.\nCrows indigenous players Eddie Betts and Charlie Cameron both had a message taped on their arms saying “I support Adam”. Betts contacted Goodes by phone before the match to let him know he wanted him to return to the game and play again.\nTwo of the highlights of a memorable night came before the first bounce.\nThe first was the Swans’ banner which simply read “RESPECT” in acknowledgment of Goodes’ struggles. The second was a standing ovation from virtually the whole crowd when a video of Goodes’ highlights was shown in the lead-up to the first bounce.\nJosh Kennedy booted 32 disposals.
