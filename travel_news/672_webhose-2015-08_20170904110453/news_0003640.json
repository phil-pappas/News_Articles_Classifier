Photo: Michele Gandolfo Michele, Katie, Gregory and Rick Gandolfo of San Francisco at Lions... \nThe Latest: Calif. wildfire grows after jumping containment Page 1 of 1 \nWhy I went: We wanted to explore some of the ancient sites of Greece and to visit a Greek island. \nDon’t miss: Visiting the ancient sites with a guide and exploring the alley streets of the Plaka in Athens. The island of Hydra is quaint and doesn’t have any cars; you walk or ride a donkey in Hydra Town and take a water taxi to the beaches. \nDon’t bother: With fancy restaurants. The neighborhood cafes serve delicious Greek dishes, and the wines are inexpensive. We found everyone to be friendly and welcoming. \nCoolest souvenir: A bottle of Mastiha, a spirit unique to Greece and introduced to us at a rooftop bar in Athens with a view of the Acropolis. \nWorth a splurge: Renting a car to explore Delphi and the ancient city sites of Corinth and Mycenae on the Peloponnese. The freedom to map your own itinerary is worth the expense of not purchasing a group bus tour. \nWish I’d packed: More time; we enjoyed Greece immensely. \nOther comments: Everyone speaks some English, so we didn’t have any difficulties communicating with locals. Be sure to try the wonderful Greek wines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:00:52.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
