Located just minutes from Los Angeles International Airport at 199 North Continental Blvd, El Segundo marks the fourth Cambria to break ground in 2015. Just last month, Choice Hotels and Fillmore Capital broke ground on another Cambria hotel & suites property in Southlake, TX.\nSet to officially open for guests the latter portion of 2016, the new 152-room upscale hotel will feature modern design that takes its cues from the fashion forward city that surrounds it, while offering a tranquil space in the midst of the fast-paced L.A. environment.\n“Breaking ground in Los Angeles marks yet another milestone for the rapidly growing Cambria brand,” said Michael Murphy, senior vice president, Upscale Brands, Choice Hotels International. “Cambria El Segundo LAX enhances our west coast presence by providing an affordable, yet upscale modern hotel experience for a broad range of travelers in one of the most important travel markets in the world.”\nThe hotel will feature amenities including a contemporary bistro, Social Circle™, serving local craft beers and freshly prepared cuisine; a state of the art fitness center, Custom Fit™; and a Back Porch outdoor area.\n“Situated in a major urban market, this property is certain to become a popular destination for upscale travelers looking to take advantage of the Los Angeles area,” said Tom Goodwin, Senior Vice President of Fillmore Hospitality. “The announcement of this property reinforces our partnership with the Cambria hotels & suites brand and is the first step in yet another successful hotel opening.”\nChoice Hotels, Fillmore Capital Partners and Fillmore Hospitality are also partnering on a Cambria hotel & suites in New Orleans and one in Nashville, both of which will break ground later this year. The four Cambria hotels & suites projects being developed by the joint venture total roughly $160 million dollars and will be managed by Fillmore Hospitality.\nSource: Choice Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:48:41.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
