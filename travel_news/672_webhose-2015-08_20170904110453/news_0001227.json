Among the key findings: Two in 10 made significant on-the-job errors (like planes flying too close together) the previous year, most of which controllers blamed on fatigue.\nMoreover, roughly a third of controllers characterized fatigue as a \"high\" or \"extreme\" safety risk.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration commissioned the report but it \"did not accept\" it, according to a July 2014 memo . The agency did, however, \"leverage ... some of the NASA findings to develop fatigue mitigations\" like altering schedules, offering education and changing FAA policies.\nIn comments released Monday along with the report, the FAA said chronic fatigue is less of a problem now than in 2012, when the report was done. Steps taken since the report include making sure controllers have at least nine hours off between shifts, restricting back-to-back \"midnight shifts\" and changes to allow for breaks.\n\"Although fatigue is an issue in any 24/7 operation, the FAA has taken many positive steps to minimize fatigue,\" the FAA said. \"The fatigue modeling we've done shows that there is greater alertness using these updating scheduling practices.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/media/NASA_Controller_Fatigue_Assessment_Report.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-11T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T10:27:09.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
