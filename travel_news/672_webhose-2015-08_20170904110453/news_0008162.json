You could smell the tidal wrack of a seaside town. \nIt was a Sunday in early May, the duck shooting season was just getting under way, and the duck shooters were in town with army-style camouflage, ammo belts and blackened faces, arguing the effective range of steel shot. \nIt was illegal to discharge a shotgun within the town limits and the ducks knew that. They flew high until they reached the town limits, and then we could see them coming in to land close to the estuary bridge. The hunters in the town and the maimais out in the estuary bristled with indignation. The museum was compiling a geology collection, and Nick was the main adviser. He was known here, and a short queue formed to take advantage of the visiting expertise. — I found this stone on top of Putauhina Island, said the first rock hound. The muttonbird island. The soil's like potting mix up there, and you don't find stones, but right up on top of the island I found one. — Right. A gastrolith, said Nick. A seal took it up there, probably. — Yes, but it's heavy. It's almost like a meteorite. Want to have a look at it? I'll nip home and come back. Word went around, and either they were themselves geologists or they simply enjoyed the magical incantations, for they held out their rocks and Nick didn't simplify his responses, and they retired, pleased. He took each rock, examined it with the hand lens, and identified them all one by one. — This looks like good pristine hornblende on this surface here. You're close to the contact alright. Or again. — Chilled gabbro. On balance, without being totally sure, I'd say it was on the plutonic side of the contact rather than themetamorphic side. Or again. — This one, I'd call a diorite porphyry. — Right, said the diorite's owner. I thought I'd carve it. It's got such a nice tight texture. Carole Power, the museum manager, turned from Nick and greeted me. — Last time I saw you was at the pub Dusty and I owned at Colac Bay. You turned up, muddy and dishevelled. . . — And bleeding, as I remember it. Route testing for Te Araroa in 2003, I'd come 12 kilometres along the flank of the Longwood Range on the service track beside Port's Race. Amos Chapple \nTe Araroa trail founder Geoff Chapple spent a year walking New Zealand's distinctive landforms. \nThe track had been overgrown and strewn with windfall, but underneath it held to a gentle descent, no more than four metres in every kilometre. \nA hundred years before, the Chinese had dug the adjoining Port's Race beautifully, tunnelling through many of the spurs, boxing it to cross the gullies, and supporting the crossing on wooden trestles. \nThe race men in their isolated service huts corked their letters into bottles and sent them floating down the race for later delivery. On calm nights, hut to hut, they floated off lighted candles through the dank forest. Gently delivered also by such small lighted rafts, or so the story went, was the opium. Since that walk, the track had been cleaned up by the Department of Conservation, and Te Araroa Southland Trust had built a high-standard access track to join it, and to traverse parts of the old goldfield. Te Araroa was well known here, and I was scheduled to give a talk that night on the track. I set up amidst the museum's display cases. Rank on rank of Maori adzes were on show, many of them shaped from the distinctive grey Southland argillite quarried from Tihaka and Colyers Island in Bluff Harbour. I had a digital projector, a laser pointer, and on-screen 3D maps that showed the trail winding through the landscape as a thin gold line. It was a talk I always ad-libbed but, equally, I'd given it many times before, and I found myself surprised at how it had begun to change. Geoff Chapple \nGNS science geologist Nick Mortimer explains the intricacies of ancient Mesozoic geology during a walk around New Zealand's southern coastline near Riverton. \n— The trail begins here, at Cape Reinga. We start the journey on old ocean floor. Basalt. It's part of what's called the Northland Allochthon. It came in from elsewhere, right Nick? \nI threw it to Nick. He was out there somewhere. \n— That's right, Geoff, came the Voice of Geology out of the dark. The allochthon is basically a thrust event, a low-angle thrust at the base of it and you've got compression there, which is what a thrust fault is. My year of geology. The laser's red spot on screen had becomeless doggedly linear, more discursive, darting sideways to seek out the unseen trench that drove so many changes within the landscape. Through Northland, across the volcanoes of Auckland, the volcanic plateau, and out of the darkness, the Voice of Geology sometimes rose, amplifying the finer points. The Whanganui River, and Wellington, so to the South Island and the sunken block of the Sounds. The laser's red spot greased up and down the 3D landscape to show the line of the Alpine Fault and on through the Longwoods to Riverton, Oreti Beach, Invercargill to Bluff. I brought up the pictures of Te Araroa walkers in the joy of completion, swinging off the AA signpost there, of Te Araroa hikers' shoes dangling from the direction sign that pointed back to Cape Reinga, and I ended with a favourite quote from the writer Frederic Gros — \"Evening will come, and the legs will have ended by engulfing, in small bites, the impossible distance.\" \nGeoff Chapple's new book. Ad Feedback \n—Watch your eyes. We'd been walking along the track that brings Te Araroa to its terminus at Stirling Point, when Nick left the track to scramble down to the base of a cliff. Fifteen metres above us, a rough mixture of cobbles was pasted onto the cliff, flock wallpaper upon one of the last ramparts of mainland New Zealand. Nick climbed towards it, and swung his heavy petrology hammer. The chips flew, the sample broke away. Nick tested it with hydrochloric acid, and looked up. — It's called the Foveaux Formation, part of the Oligocene shoreline. It's an unconformity, a geologically significant contact and boundary in its own right. It's literally clinging to the cliff. Another few hundred years of coastal erosion and it'll be totally gone. I've gone for a piece where there's lots of matrix. I haven't seen this lithology before. It's possible there could be something useful for extraction, like a microfossil, a radiolarian maybe, or aforam. Things that you can't really see. An unconformity. The black gabbro of Bluff Hill was part of the Median Batholith, 245 million years old. The Foveaux Formation was somewhere between 25 and 30 million years old, part of the famous Oligocene drowning story. One overlaid the other, but if you touched the margin where Nick had sledged off the sample from its underlying rock, you put your finger on 200 million years of missing geology. Not too many clues here then, though I'd met with enough geologists by now to know that, however truncated, they'd get something out of it. The rocks always talked. Dependent on what you wanted to know, the clues were everywhere. The Mesozoic geologists, I thought, were writing a great detective story. Like most detective stories it was written backwards, starting with the dumb fact of a couple of beautiful South Pacific islands which just happened to have a continental geology, alps and volcanoes, at deeper levels a greywacke spine, a volcanic arc that came to visit and stayed on, a red slice of ocean floor shunned by trees. Amidst the discomforts and also the fun of their field trips, the Mesozoic sleuths had gathered the lines of evidence, wound the story back, put their theories to the test and argued amongst themselves. They were sometimes wrong but always curious, and they always, since the days of Alexander McKay and Harold Wellman, moved the story on. \nNick probably saw it that way, for as we walked along the Foveaux track with Bluff at our backs, he said \n— Even this single hill, Geoff. You're building on generations of geological work that enables you to localise it, and date it as Permian, and put it into the context of adjacent terranes. \nNick was known for his collegial generosity. A recognition of the thousand small bites that in science might progress towards some new insight. \nI recalled a conversation back in the Longwoods when we'd been driving along bumpy forest roads, in the rain, and, as can happen within the slingshot pleasures of travel, the words had seemed charged with magic. \n\"It's a big-picture scale,\" he'd said. \"It's seeing the woods for the trees. Seeing the terranes and the batholiths. Nice big simple concepts that go across New Zealand, and you're not setting aside but summarising all the detail that by itself is almost indigestible. And it's huge.\" \nBecause of Nick's expertise in petrology, he'd written some of the programmes for the offshore dredging of Zealandia. \nHe'd been aboard those ships, and as the truck bounced along, on its Longwoods trajectory, he'd kept on with his recollection. \n\"When you're working offshore, because the samples you get are so few and far between, and because they're so expensive and there's been such effort to get you there, they take on a significance or relevance far beyond the size of the scruffy wet rock that you're holding in your hand.\" \nThe scruffy wet rock. Geologists gained their evidences by whatever means. \nThey wrote the story backwards into deep time, and I read it forwards. \nThey helped light up the slow movements of the earth, and I'd had moments during the year when I'd seen the big mute forms of it — let's say — stamping on the spot. \nNo actual movement — leave that to the wind and the trees — but whole horizons, dark and lumpy here and smooth and grey there, that seemed to quiver with ponderous momentum. \nWe walked on around Bluff Hill. Stewart Island stood on the horizon as a low shadow and we walked finally back into the everyday world of cars at the terminus of State Highway 1 and the yellow AA signpost that signalled the end of Te Araroa. \nThe trail ended here. \n— Yep, it's kind of nice to see the road sign, said Nick. The southern end of the country. \n— But the geology doesn't stop, Nick, I said. \n— You're right. The Median Batholith goes on from here, Stewart Island is part of it, and then it goes on undersea and, we think, surfaces again at the Bounty Islands. \n— Okay. \nThere went the Voice of Geology. It didn't stop with anything as obvious as land's end. \nIt'd held in its hand one scruffy wet rock, and by that weight felt the geological enterprise expand through all the arcane skills and all the generations of its practitioners, their persistent tapping against the cryptic planet. \nI'd spent a year amidst the vastness of it. \nTo get anywhere near the occluded process of the planet at its work, you had to open your mind right up, transcend common sense, expand your reach towards the wonder and the madness of the gods. \nTime to go. We shrank back to the size of men, got into the Nissan truck and began the drive back up State Highway 1 to Dunedin. Writer goes west \nTe Araroa walking trail founder Geoff Chapple's new book, Terrain: Travels through a deep landscape , explores underlying geology along the trail route. On 12 September, Chapple joins Chris Maclean and Shaun Barnett, authors of Tramping: A New Zealand history , at Auckland's Going West Festival for a session titled A Walk on the Wild Side . In a later session, Chapple discusses the biography Maurice Gee: Life and Work, with the author, Rachel Barrowman.
