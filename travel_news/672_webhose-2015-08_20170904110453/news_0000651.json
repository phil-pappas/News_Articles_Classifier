Times' theme park newsletter. I'm Funland theme park blogger Brady MacDonald , and this week we check in on SeaWorld’s continuing troubles, drop in on a secret Disneyland wedding and join first-timers on a visit to Kennywood. Subscribe to the newsletter On the road \nThe Walt Disney Hometown Museum in Marceline, Mo., is hoping to revive the vintage Disneyland attraction known as Midget Autopia , the first park ride ever moved to a non-Disney property. The museum plans a $500,000 Kickstarter campaign to bring back the 10-car ride that ran in Anaheim from 1957 until It’s a Small World displaced it in 1966. (Walt Disney Hometown Museum) Blue World \nThe California Coastal Commission delays a vote on SeaWorld San Diego’s proposed killer whale habitat expansion after receiving 75,000 letters and emails on the treatment of orcas in captivity. The larger tank, known as Blue World, would nearly double the size of the killer whale environment. (Don Bartletti / Los Angeles Times) Growing empire \nDisneyland buys two large parcels of land near the park for $48 million. Screamscape has a nice aerial map that shows how the acquisition could play into Disneyland’s larger long-term expansion plans . (Christina House / For The Times) Coney Island \nI would have to say Coney Island is at the top of my amusement park bucket list. I find it completely absurd that I’ve covered amusement parks for nearly a decade and never made it to the granddaddy of them all. USA Today’s 10 can’t-miss Coney Island attractions pretty much makes me want to pack my suitcase right now, hop on a flight to JFK and take the D train directly to Brooklyn. Secret Disneyland wedding \nSan Francisco magazine recounts how an Oakland couple quietly sneaked 25 guests into the Enchanted Tiki Room for a stealth four-minute wedding ceremony without Disneyland officials finding out. The short-but-sweet vows saved the couple the five-figure price tag of a typical Disneyland wedding, and everybody in the wedding party got a Dole Whip. Dancing cars \nDisney finally reveals the name for the ride replacing the short-lived levitating tires attraction in Cars Land at Disney California Adventure: Luigi’s Rollickin’ Roadsters . The backstory for the ride sounds both confusing and intriguing: Riders in anthropomorphic cars will “dance” at a large family gathering in a small Italian village. Good work if you can get it \nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette sends five summer interns to Kennywood to find out what first-timers think about one of the best amusement parks in the United States (in my humble opinion). Check out the comprehensive report and the great video for their reactions to Phantom’s Revenge, Jack Rabbit, Musik Express and Ghostwood Estate. And finally \nSix hotels that will give you a free ticket to Disneyland. (Wyndham Hotel) Subscribe to the newsletter \nStill need more theme park news?
