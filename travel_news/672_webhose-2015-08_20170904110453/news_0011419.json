Erica Nansen, spokeswoman with the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, confirmed Thursday that one man was in stable condition and the other was discharged. Las Vegas Sands Corp. spokesman Ron Reese said the resort-casino's security guards had kicked the pair off the property before and they had been known to loiter in front of The Venetian on a regular basis. He says the two were spotted on video surveillance by security Monday morning jumping a fence to get into the canal outside along Las Vegas Boulevard, but struggled to swim and were unconscious but breathing when the guards pulled them out. No criminal charges have been filed. The Clark County Fire Department said crews were called about 7:45 a.m. Monday for a reported drowning or diving incident at the property's canal, known for hosting gondola rides that go inside and outside the hotel-casino.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T22:04:03.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
