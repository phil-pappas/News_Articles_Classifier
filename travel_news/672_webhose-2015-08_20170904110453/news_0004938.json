Starting in the vibrant city of Vancouver, known for its cosmopolitan vibe set in the backdrops of the North Shore Mountains, guests drive along the renowned \"Sea to Sky\" highway as they set out for the chic alpine playground of Whistler. Staying at the Four Seasons Resort Whistler , a Signature Hotel , guests will be pampered by its fabulous accommodations located in Whistler's Upper Village where the evening's Signature Highlight Dinner will take place, promising a gastronomic experience made with only the best local ingredients. From there, travellers head east towards unspoiled nature, staying in three of Canada's most iconic hotels. In Lake Louise, guests stay at The Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise - repeatedly named on the prestigious Conde Nast Traveler \"Gold List\" for hospitality excellence. In Banff, guests will be pampered at The Fairmont Banff Springs for two nights - Canada's \"Castle in the Rockies\" providing legendary hospitality for more than 125 years. In Jasper, guests will stay at The Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge that serves as the luxury base before motoring along the unforgettable Icefields Parkway and witnessing amazing scenes such as the Crowfoot Glacier and Columbia Icefield, North America's largest sub-polar ice pack. Then, travellers will experience one of the most renowned trains in the world, VIA Rail Canada's \"The Canadian\". Along 4,466 kilometres of breathtaking scenery, guests travel from western Canada to Toronto that offers spectacular views of the lakes in Northern Ontario, the lush boreal forest, the western Prairies, and the magnificent Rocky Mountains. Aboard this unique train, guests will settle into their private compartment with en-suite facilities, enjoying delicious meals freshly prepared by skilled chefs on board that include regional specialties and a selection of Canadian wines, and VIA Rail's impeccable service. As travellers discover the unique pleasures of rail travel by day, at night, the gentle rocking of the train will lull them to sleep. Majesty of the Rockies & Alaskan Cruise The 14 or 21 day \"Luxury Gold\" itinerary is a wondrous journey through the supreme majesty of western Canada and Alaska by road, rail and sea. Guests commence by travelling through historic towns, verdant national parks and sophisticated resorts. From exploring picturesque Victoria, with a private breakfast held in the 55 fragrant acres of Butchart Gardens, to having a \"Relaxed Start\" in the peaceful setting of Emerald Lake, guests will have the option to sit spellbound aboard Rocky Mountaineer's \"GoldLeaf\" viewing car for one of the world's most romantic train rides. In Vancouver, guests have their Celebration Dinner at La Terrazza , an award-winning restaurant at the edge of historic Yaletown known as the city's quintessential Italian fine-dining experience. For guests booked on the 21-day version of this itinerary, they board Holland America Line's ms Nieuw Amsterdam for an unforgettable Alaska Glacier Bay Inside Passage Cruise. Designed for Alaskan cruising with its air lounges, teak decks and room verandahs, the ms Nieuw Amsterdam allows for comfortable observation of the ever-changing panorama and vast wilderness of America's \"last frontier\". Guests will experience impeccable service and gourmet dining, with every stateroom offering a gracious retreat and luxurious living: from the soft caress of a personal bathrobe to fine chocolates on their pillow at night. As the ship slowly glides past a maze of bays, glacier-carved fjords and waterways that are protected from the open sea by islands and other landmasses, guests can enjoy onboard activities that include gourmet cooking lessons and a salon & spa. Guests make a stop at Juneau where they can let their imaginations run wild while exploring the state capitol. In the watery wilderness of Glacier Bay National Park, guests behold a landscape at its literal moment of creation. In this isolated land, the shrill noises of modern life are replaced with the deep, thunderous boom of building-sized icebergs calving into the sea from a vast river of ice. Southern Grace This 9-day jukebox journey takes guests from the home of country music, blues and rock 'n' roll to the multicultural melting pot of New Orleans - peppered throughout with the flavours of America's deep south. In Nashville, the home of country music, guests enjoy a \"Relaxed Start\" to their day before visiting country music royalty at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, housing memorabilia from stars such as Hank Williams, Loretta Lynn and Garth Brooks. After touring the historic Studio B, once the recording home of Elvis Presley, Chet Atkins, Eddy Arnold, and the Everly Brothers, guests embark on a Signature Experience by working with a professional sound engineer in a 30-minute, choir style recording session. Each guest will receive his or her own copy of the recording as a unique souvenir - how many people can claim they've recorded a song in the same studio where \"King Elvis\" created so many of his hits? Then off to Memphis, the birthplace of the blues, where guests visit the Rock 'n' Roll Museum before making a pilgrimage to Graceland - a museum dedicated to King Elvis. At Natchez Mississippi, guests will check into the Monmouth Historic Inn - an early 19th-century antebellum mansion set in 26 acres of manicured gardens. Built in 1818, the Monmouth Historic Inn is a National Historic Landmark and tells a tale of the Old South and of the New South, of transition and transformation. Guests will stay in one of the inn's elegantly appointed rooms. In the evening, guests head to the inn's beautifully appointed dining room at Restaurant 1818 , where they will enjoy an elegant, five-course Southern dinner offering one of the only true remaining Antebellum dining experiences. From there, guests head to the \"big easy\", New Orleans, where they will join a Local Expert in the atmospheric French Quarter and explore the twisted path of one of the \"Cities of the Dead\" - the above ground final resting place of pirates, politicians and voodoo queens. After journeying through beautiful marshlands and swamps in search of Louisiana's famous reptilian citizens, guests recharge at New Orleans premier The Roosevelt New Orleans, a Waldorf Astoria Hotel where they will be pampered by luxurious Southern hospitality. \"Luxury Gold\" travellers will bask in the glow and elegant centuries-old history of the huge chandeliers in the hotel's grand lobby, while they relax in one of the 504 beautifully upscale rooms that embody the rich heritage of Southern hospitality.
