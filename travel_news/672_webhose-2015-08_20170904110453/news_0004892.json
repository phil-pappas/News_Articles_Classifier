We’ve been nominated for a number of years, so we’re all extremely proud to have finally won. Our property partners attending on the night came over to congratulate us which we really appreciated. Being recognised by the BTAs gives prospective clients confidence in Silverdoor and an assurance of a quality service. \nThe judges were impressed by your large global footprint - what is your global strategy for the next 12 months? Our strategy is a collaborative effort with our clients. By talking with our clients we identify locations that are in demand and actively seek new partners in these areas. We’ll continue to increase our international spread by sending our supply management team around the world, finding the best serviced apartments for our clients. \nHas winning the award had any positive benefits for your company – both internally and externally? If so what have those benefits been? It’s been a real boost for our staff. We’re proudly displaying the trophy in our reception and it’s been great to talk about an independent ‘seal of approval’ with our prospective clients. \nSince the win what has Silverdoor been up to? It’s been a busy year at SilvedDoor. Shortly after the BTAs we celebrated our 15 th birthday with a fantastic event attended by more than 300 people from the serviced apartment sector. We’ve also put a new internal structure into place which will further improve the efficiency of the service we provide and we continue to grow our international offering. \nWhat's in the pipeline for Silverdoor for 2015? Our new structure is now in place and is a reflection of the next stage of our development as a company. In the coming months we’ll be making some senior appointments geared towards ensuring our continued growth. \nWhat did you enjoy most – apart from wining - about the awards evening It has to be the state of euphoria when we won. We were sitting next to one of our valued clients, who also picked up an award, and they were so happy to see one of their preferred suppliers also winning an award. \nWhat the judges said: The panel were impressed by the Silverdoor’s innovative technology, the 98 per cent client retention rate, excellent staff development programme and better-than-expected growth. \nHOW TO ENTER THE 2016 BUSINESS TRAVEL AWARDS \nEntries for the 2016 Business Travel Awards are now open.
