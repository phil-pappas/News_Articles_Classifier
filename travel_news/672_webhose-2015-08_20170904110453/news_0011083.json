Photo courtesy of Delta Air Lines I worked at Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines between 2004 and 2006. My office was across the street from the Delta Flight Museum , which covers the carrier’s history from its beginning. Delta can trace its history back to the earliest days of aviation. The global carrier began as The Huff Daland Dusters crop-dusting operation, founded in Macon, Ga., in 1924.\nIn 1928, C. E. Woolman, founder of Delta Air Lines, bought Huff Daland Dusters and renamed it Delta Air Service.\nA year later, Delta begins operating its first passenger flights on route stretching from Dallas, to Jackson, Miss., via Shreveport and Monroe, La., using five-seat Travel Air S-6000B airplanes, one of which is on display in the Delta Flight Museum.\nDuring the 1940s, the airline began to grow rapidly. The carrier introduced Douglas DC-2 and DC-3 aircraft, began using stewardesses as part of their flight crews, moved its headquarters from Monroe to Atlanta and changed its corporate name to Delta Air Lines, Inc.\nIn the 1950s, Delta began its international expansion -- with flights to the Caribbean and Caracas, Venezuela -- after merging with Chicago and Southern Air Lines. In 1955, Delta began using the hub-and-spoke system, where flights bring travelers to a hub like Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport , then connects them to other cities in its network. It closed the decade by becoming the first carrier to launch Douglas DC-8 jet service. It was also when the airline unveiled its iconic red, white, and blue triangle \"widget\" logo.\nThe 1960s began with Delta becoming the first airline to launch Convair 880 jet service. A year later it began nonstop service from Atlanta to Los Angeles. In 1965, Delta became the first airline to launch Douglas DC-9 service.\nBy 1970, Delta had an all-jet passenger fleet, and it began flying Boeing 747s . In 1972, the carrier merged with Northeast Airlines, making it a major carrier in New York and Boston, with direct routes to Florida. It also began operating the Boeing 727 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar.\nAfter passage of the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, Delta begins trans-Atlantic service from Atlanta to London. A year later, Delta celebrated its 50th anniversary and began flights to Frankfurt, West Germany.\nIn 1981, Delta launched the frequent flyer program that eventually became SkyMiles , in 1995. After Delta suffers financial losses, employees raise $30 million in payroll deductions to purchase the carrier’s first Boeing 767, named \"The Spirit of Delta.\" That aircraft is now housed in the Delta Flight Museum.\nWestern Airlines merged with Delta in 1987, which made the Atlanta-based carrier the fourth-largest U.S. carrier and fifth-largest carrier in the world. The airline began its first trans-Pacific service, from Atlanta to Portland, Oregon, to Tokyo, and the carrier opened operations in Asia in 1988.\nThe 1990s were busy for Delta, which became the first airline to offer McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jet service in the U.S. It bought Pan Am's trans-Atlantic routes and the Pan Am Shuttle, which was, at the time, the largest acquisition of flights in airline history.\nIn 1996, Delta customers gained access to the carrier’s website, SkyLinks, where they could make reservations and buy tickets. It also launched Delta Express, a low-fare carrier, with service out of Orlando, Florida. In 1997, added the Boeing 777 to its fleet.\nIn 2000, Delta was one of the four founding members -- along with AeroMexico , Air France and Korean Air -- of the SkyTeam global alliance. By 2002, the airline had unveiled check-in kiosks, expanded gate information systems and the ability to check-in on at delta.com .\nThree years later, Delta unveiled what it called a new model for passenger check-in: a lobby redesign, expanded kiosk use, the introduction of Delta Direct phone banks, lobby assist agents and new signs and processes to improve traffic flow. It also joined with Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines to create the largest domestic codeshare alliance. A year later, Northwest and Continental join Delta as full members of SkyTeam alliance.\nOn Sept. 14, 2005, Delta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A month later, it started one of the largest one-month expansions in its history, adding service on seven new Latin American and Caribbean routes. It also began making cuts to its long-time hub in Cincinnati, which had almost 700 flights at its peak.\nIn 2006, Delta announced a major plan to make New York’s JFK Airport into an international hub and launched flights between Atlanta and Johannesburg via Dakar, Senegal. The airline thwarted a hostile takeover attempt by US Airways in 2007 and emerged from bankruptcy on April 30. The carrier unveiled a trans-Atlantic joint venture with Air France.\nIn 2008, Delta acquired Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines. It became the first U.S. airline to announce adding onboard Wi-Fi for domestic mainline fleet. A year later, the airline celebrated 80 years of passenger service.\nDelta expanded its trans-Atlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and became the only U.S. airline to serve six continents, with introduction of nonstop flights between Los Angeles and Sydney, Australia. It rebranded more than 240 domestic airports with Delta logos. In 2010, Delta announced plans to spend more than $2 billion through 2013 to improve the customer experience.\nDelta announced plans in December 2012 to buy a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic, paying $360 million to Singapore Airlines. This allowed the carriers to operate 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and JFK and Newark airports.\nIn 2013, the carrier announced it was dehubbing former Northwest hub Memphis International Airport, while cuts in Cincinnati also continued. A year later, Delta announced it was investing more than $770 million through 2016 to refresh the interiors on select Boeing and Airbus aircraft to provide power at every seat, add new slim-line seats with adjustable headrests, updated lavatories and add more efficient galleys to improve passenger comfort.\nThe first phase of Delta's $1.4 billion expansion at JFK’s Terminal 4 -- with nine new international gates, more baggage space and a central security checkpoint opened in May 2013. In January 2015, the next phase of the terminal opened with 11 more gates.\nIn 2014, Delta renamed its classes of service: Delta One on long-haul international routes and flights between New York-JFK and Los Angeles or San Francisco; First Class, on short-haul international and domestic routes; and Delta Comfort+, an upgraded experience on all two cabin aircraft around the world, along with Main Cabin and Basic Economy service.", "external_links": ["http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/5/P/Delta-777-jpg.jpg", "http://atlanta-atl.worldairportguides.com/", "https://www.deltamuseum.org/", "http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/skymiles.html", "http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/delta-history/aircraft-by-type/jet/boeing-767", "http://www.deltamuseum.org/exhibits/exhibits/aircraft/travel-air-6b-sedan", "https://aeromexico.com/", "http://www.delta.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/airlines/fl/A-History-of-Delta-Air-Lines.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/5/P/Delta-777-jpg.jpg&description=We"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:25:49.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
