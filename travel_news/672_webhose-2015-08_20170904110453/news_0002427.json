Despite this, the DoT still expects to meet tourism revenue goals of more than US$6 billion by 2016. \n\nCredit: 123rf \n\nThe change in strategy comes as tourism receipt numbers are at an all-time high of US$2.1 billion based on January-May figures, with tourists spending more at $1,200 on average. They are also staying longer, averaging around 10 to 11 days. \n\nCalling it a “paradigm shift”, Domingo Ramon Enerio III, COO of DoT’s marketing arm, Tourism Promotions Board (TPB), said the emphasis is “on foreign exchange earnings, not just on the physical numbers; more on the income side and how we can get more tourists to spend more”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T11:37:43.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
