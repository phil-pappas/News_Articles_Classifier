Airports may use these fees to fund FAA-approved projects such as noise reduction, enhancing safety, security, and the like. PFCs can only be collected for an FAA-approved program for an established amount and time period.\nThe FAA-approved plan provided funding for six Inglewood schools. This first work plan requests an installment of $10 million for sound insulation at Payne Elementary School, Woodworth Elementary School, and the Child Development Center at Woodworth Elementary School. Other campuses that will be involved in the noise mitigation program include Oak Elementary School, Monroe Middle School, and Morningside High School.\nSound-insulation construction will include replacing standard doors with thicker, solid doors; installing interior acoustic ceiling tiles and other insulation as needed; framing and insulating top floors; replacing standard windows with sound-rated windows; replacing/installing heating and air conditioning systems; miscellaneous electrical upgrades where needed; and other work necessary to achieve a targeted interior noise level of 45 decibels or less.\nSource:- LAX", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:32:57.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
