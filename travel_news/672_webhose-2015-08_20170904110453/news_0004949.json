Sane wanderers avoid summer in Florence (and the thundering herds) like the plague. \nBest Bets: Yes, go ahead and see David. The disproportionate body leaves me cold, but I wasn't looking at sweet Davide from defeated Goliath's perspective--where the exaggeration would make sense to me. That's why I'm a curmudgeon, but a practical one: I like the covered market. Still, the Uffizi houses the premier collection of Italian Renaissance art, the Ponte Vecchio is the most photographed bridge (with...shopping!), and the Duomo hosts Brunelleschi's dome and Giotto's bell tower (go downstairs in the Duomo for ancient history, climb the dome for views of the city). \nThe downside: Food. Florence hosts millions of tourists, many of whom will fall victim of food made poorly for maximum profit. Here's a start on finding where the locals eat: Piero's Florence: Where to Eat and Drink like a local in Florence . Rome, Italy \nWho Should Go: Lovers of conspicuous consumption - You've got plenty of ATMs and three streets to savage--Via Condotti, Via Borgognona and Via Frattina. Good hunting. History and archaeology buffs - anyone who's lent an ear. Lovers of the irrationally rational Youthful music-clubbers \nWhen you Should Go: Rome is a carnival all year long. Italians avoid Rome in August because it's hot and muggy and everybody who's anybody is away at the beach, so August isn't even high season. You'll find lodging bargains in late July and August, but demand air conditioning and thick windows. You'll thank me later. \nBest Bets: Rome, like Venice is a walking city. Lots of things you've always wanted to see are free or cheap , so don't sweat the entertainment budget if you're reasonably mobile (don't throw it away, either--you'll spend it on lodging). \nUp and Coming: An area in the south of the Eternal City called Testaccio is becoming a booming center of the Rome music scene in clubs dug out of a hill made up of old, busted up Roman amphoras. \nThe downside: Rome is expensive, buy like all huge cities, there are lots of free things to do . You can spend days just walking around and viewing the Roman ruins that sprout like weeds in the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:07:57.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
