Many of the furnishings are made from recycled or salvaged materials, art work is made from reclaimed wood from a local barn and the drinking glasses are made from recycled wine bottles. \nSummerWood Inn (summerwoodwine.com) guests (especially those who reserve the suite with outdoor terrace) are among the privileged few who experience a daily farm fresh cooked-to-order breakfast by Chef Kelly and her team, sip afternoon wine from the SummerWood winery, and can (with reservations), have Chef Kelly personally design luncheon and dinner menus that will meet (and exceed) every wish (from lactose and gluten free to calorie counters). \nAt a recent luncheon hosted at SummerWood and designed by Chef Kelly guests dined on: \n• Salad Lyonnais (perfect poached egg, bacon, pomme frites, haricot vert with Dijon Vinaigrette) \n• Spice Roasted Chicken with English peas \n• Black bean and zucchini cake, Avocado cream and Windrose greens \n• Orange – panna cotta with candied fennel, olive oil and salt cookies, berries and agave \n- Wine selection \n- 2013 Summerwood Vin Blanc (65 percent Marsanne; 21 percent Roussanne; 14 percent Grenache Blanc) \nA Sip Away \nA few steps away from the SummerWood Inn, guests enjoy the tasting room.
