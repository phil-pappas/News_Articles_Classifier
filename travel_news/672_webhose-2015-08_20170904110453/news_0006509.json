(Photo: Devan Sipher) \nWriters can write anywhere. But there is something about being on the road that truly inspires writers to create and to push the boundaries of their own inspiration. \n“I can still remember the hopeful anticipation I felt gazing at the shimmering beach and breathtaking cliffs as I made my way as a single guy to a destination wedding in Carmel,” Sipher, who is also a writer for The New York Times , explained about crafting the opening scene of The Scenic Route . \nThat’s another trip I am about to make — the one to Carmel. It feels like Sipher and I may be on similar wavelengths when it comes to both travel and writing. \nDriving along the Big Sur coastline to Carmel. (Photo: Thinkstock) \nThese two things are so intertwined that Yahoo Travel is talking to writers about how they travel, why they travel, and where their inspiration for writing and wanderlust really comes from. \nYahoo Travel: Tell me about your idea of the perfect trip. \nDevan Sipher: What I love most about traveling is that I become my best self. I’m my most adventurous and my most fully present. When I say “adventurous,” I don’t necessarily mean hang-gliding from an alp. I mean taking advantage of any opportunity that comes my way, whether it be joining an impromptu polka lesson in a Vancouver park or squeezing alongside five strangers in a shared taxi to Marrakesh. \nJamaa el Fna, Marrakesh, Morocco. (Photo: Thinkstock) \nI don’t just stop to smell the roses. I stop to smell and taste the fresh-baked bread and Belgian waffles and borekas. When I travel, there is no such thing as a bad time for gelato, including in the middle of a morning run in Genoa. I once hiked two hours and crossed the Bosphorus for a recommended almond pudding in Istanbul. And I would happily do it again. \nIn my first novel, one of the characters is a travel writer, and she explains that “travel” comes from the word “travail.” And “travail” comes from the Latin word “tripalium,” which is the name of a three-pronged instrument of torture. Travel is something we do for pleasure, and yet it requires effort. I have found the greater the effort, the greater the reward. \nRelated: Brains Meet Bikinis—Island Hopping for Book Nerds \nYT: What is the best experience you’ve had on a recent trip? \nDS: Last fall, I found myself biking at dusk along a one-lane road through barren marshland in the Venetian Lagoon. I hadn’t planned on going to a remote rural island while visiting Venice for the first time, but someone suggested it as an antidote to the hordes of tourists along the Grand Canal. So with the assistance of two ferries and a rented bike, I found my way to an extraordinary meal at an agriturismo that served tantalizing just-picked produce and fresh-caught fish. The meal was supposed to be lunch, but several wrong turns along nameless byways resulted in hours of additional pedaling (often in circles) and a very late arrival — and an even later departure. \nRelated: Never Leave Your Room With These Hotels for Book Lovers \nBiking at dusk on a bike without a headlight, with no cellphone service (and hence no map) and miles from anyone who spoke my language was a good way for me to learn things about myself. I learned what scares me (being run over in a country where no one can identify me) and what excites me (racing along an ancient lagoon by the light of a full moon). Yet despite my fear every time I spied oncoming headlights, I remember feeling exhilarated by the evening breeze and grateful I had pushed myself past my comfort zone. \nRelated: 5 Amazing Itineraries for the Book Nerd in You \nYT: What are the essentials you need to bring with you on a trip? \nDS: For me, the one essential for any trip is a music playlist that matches the mood of the place. I like Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring while hiking in New England and Gustav Holst’s The Planets while driving through the moonscape-like badlands in the Southwest. When running in Italy, Vivaldi and Verdi feel just right, but for some reason they don’t work for me in Los Angeles, where I prefer Macklemore and Zedd. I also like to research native musicians, and became a fan of Ketama while visiting Spain. \nDevan Sipher is a writer of The New York Times ’s “Vows” wedding column and the author of two novels, The Wedding Beat and The Scenic Route . \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
