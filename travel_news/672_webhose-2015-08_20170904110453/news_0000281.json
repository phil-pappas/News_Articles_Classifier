Those who wanted to visit Kashmir this year would have thought 'Why should we put our lives at risk?',\" Ahmad told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nWith pictures of last year's floods still fresh in their minds, \"the weather events and their repeated reportage in the media directly influenced tourist arrivals this year, causing a 60 percent decline,\" he added.\nMore than 300 people died in the floods in September 2014 and thousands were marooned for more than two weeks.\nWith two months of the current tourism season left, travel agencies operating in Srinagar said they had received a stream of cancellations.\n\"More than 70 percent of our bookings stand cancelled, as customers ... were quite apprehensive about the weather. We couldn't say much by way of persuasion as it was a matter of weather - something beyond our control,\" said Nasir Khan, marketing head for Shiraz Travels in Srinagar.\n\"How Kashmir's tourism is doing this year is reflected in the air fares for Srinagar,\" he added.\nIn the past four years, the fare for Srinagar from different Indian cities rose as high as 25,000 rupees ($392) due to visitor demand, but this year it has dropped as low as 3,000 rupees, he noted.\nAbdul Rehman, president of Tourist Taxi Stand Srinagar, said his drivers had cut fares by half in a drastic bid to woo passengers.\n\"There is hardly a car owner in our taxi stand who has not got his car against a bank loan. They have to do something to manage the monthly loan instalments,\" Rehman said.\n(Reporting by Athar Parvaiz; editing by Tim Pearce and Megan Rowling.
