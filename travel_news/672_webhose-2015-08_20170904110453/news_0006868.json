The new domestic campaign, informed by consumer insights research conducted by South African Tourism, encourages South Africans to take a leisure break away from home and start travelling their own country. The campaign premise is about the joy of discovering new experiences for the first time, thus highlighting that South Africa has a myriad tourist experiences to be discovered, whether one is a new or a seasoned traveller.\nTourism Month celebrations rotate among the provinces each year, with a different province given an opportunity to host the celebrations. During this month all provinces are encouraged to showcase their leisure experiences on offer so as to inspire domestic travelers. Tourism Month coincides with Heritage Month in South Africa, fitting for this year’s choice of Limpopo as the host province. Limpopo is a culturally rich and diverse province that boasts attractions such as the Modjadji cycad forest, the Mapungubwe Heritage Site and the Ribolla Cultural Route to mention but a few.\n“Limpopo is a wonderful region of the country to explore. It’s warm, friendly culture makes one feel truly at home. It is a must-visit destination for any South African who wants to learn more about South Africa’s cultural heritage.” added Hanekom.Minister Hanekom explained that domestic tourism is critical to the long term growth and sustainability of South Africa’s tourism industry.\nSource:-South Africa Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:55:06.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
