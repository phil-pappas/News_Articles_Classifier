From Barry Sheene in the Seventies to “Fast” Freddie Spencer in the Eighties, “Revvin’” Kevin Schwantz in the Nineties and, more recently, Valentino Rossi, arguably the greatest rider in the sport’s history, motorcycling world champions have been carried to victory on Michelin tyres. The 2016 season will bring an exciting development for the sport and the manufacturer as Michelin becomes the supplier of control tyres for MotoGP. That means tyres with the same specification for all, regardless of their status or the financial clout of their teams, will be used across a grid that at present features 25 riders from 11 different countries competing in 18 races across four continents. Lean machine: Barry Sheene in 1977 Success in MotoGP is about the package and the synergy achieved in making the sum of the parts greater than the whole. The key elements are undoubtedly man, machine and, in recent years, the electronic rider aids. But there are one (or rather two) important elements missing from that list: the tyres. That small credit card-sized patch of contact between the tyre and the track and how the tyre feeds back information to the rider can be the difference between victory and defeat. The 2016 season promises to be the most exciting in MotoGP for some time For years Michelin and Rossi, nicknamed “the Doctor”, enjoyed a special relationship, the Italian providing unrivalled feedback to help ensure that Michelin remained the tyre of choice for those at the front of the grid. And in a series that is the pinnacle of motorcycling, in which the top speeds are fast approaching 220mph, and the fastest corners can be taken at maximum lean angle at close to 200mph, the development of the 2016 tyres is a task Michelin is taking very seriously. The company has employed the services of Colin Edwards, the “Texan Tornado” and a former team-mate of Rossi. However, the responsibility is not Edwards’s alone. With five manufacturers – Aprilia, Ducati, Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha – supplying bikes, different riders prefer different characteristics, and no two machines work the same. Already Randy De Puniet and Michael Laverty, respectively the Suzuki and Aprilia test riders, have provided encouraging feedback after a trial at Le Mans this year that the tyre development is going in the right direction. Speed demon: “Fast” Freddie Spencer racing in 1983 The 2016 season promises to be the most exciting in MotoGP for some time with every manufacturer, team and rider learning how to extract the best performance from the new Michelin tyres. Some will undoubtedly adapt better than others, but there could be a few surprises in store.
