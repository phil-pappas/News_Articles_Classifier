The incident killed at least two Chinese visitors, leaving 18 others dead and injuring 125 people as reported on Tuesday morning. \n\"My heart felt condolences to the victims, their families and those effected by the incident,\" said Tourism and Sports Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul. \"In this difficult time, the staff of the Ministry of Tourism and Sports and I will work to ensure the safety of our country and citizens.\" \nThe ministry recently revealed that 4.6 million visitors from mainland China visited the Kingdom last year, accounting for 18.6% of the 24.8 million international arrivals in 2014. From January to July this year, Chinese visitors have risen to 4.7 million accounting for 32% of 15 million international arrivals. \nThe increasing number of Chinese tourists has prompted the ministry to raise its full-year forecast for Chinese arrivals from 5.4 million announced in the beginning of this year to seven million visitors. \nAlthough the Chinese government devalued the yuan, the minister believed that this would not impact Thailand. However, Kasikorn Research Centre stated that as China has been an important market for Thailand, the impact of the devaluation on Thailand may be felt in exports and tourism. If the Chinese currency does not fall further, those two sectors should not be more severely threatened. \nThroughout this year, the centre expects Chinese tourist arrivals to reach 7.24 million, increasing 56.1% from last year. However, this projection was announced before Monday's bomb blast. There is no revised number from the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. \nAccording to Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) executive director of East Asia Srisuda Wanapinyosak, TAT believes that Chinese movies shot in Thailand will still attract Chinese tourists to the Kingdom, especially after Detective Chin Tang , or Lost In Thailand Part II , which will be in cinemas later this year. \nThe megahit Lost In Thailand is a 2012 Chinese comedy filmed in Chiang Mai, making the northern city one of the top destinations for Chinese travellers. The sequel was shot in Bangkok and Lao Tak Lak, or Pak Khlong Lat Phli Floating Market, in Ratchaburi.
