Based in Lincoln Park, Michigan , Pierino Frozen Foods purchases 'Grade A' eggs in bulk to make pasta noodles, and incoming ingredient quality remains paramount to success. But there is no controlling commodity pricing. Since December, more than 48 million birds have been lost in avian flu control efforts - all of which has pushed egg prices skywards. Guglielmetti first began exploring a new way to individually quick freeze (IQF) in 2014 after learning about a new rolling-wave IQF freezer from Linde LLC, the CRYOLINE ® CW (CRYOWAVE ® ) IQF freezer, which had proven successful for individually quick freezing diced poultry, meatballs, mushrooms, and other foods. The special advantage the CRYOWAVE freezer now gives Pierino Frozen Foods though is not just quality and productivity, but competitiveness, he says. \"Commodity prices on eggs have just gone through the roof, so it's nice to have some efficiencies in the facility to combat that.\" Gianni Guglielmetti , president, Pierino Frozen Foods, Inc.The patented CRYOWAVE IQF Freezer uses a proprietary rolling-wave action to keep items on the belt separate as they freeze. This is no small feat when processing thousands of pounds per hour of wet, moist pasta. IQF flighted freezers can easily break fragile products and are prone to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) snow build up, requiring frequent clean outs for maintenance. Even with traditional in-line tunnel freezers, IQF items tend to stick to the belt and clump together when blasted with cryogen at temperatures well in excess of 50 degrees F below zero. Sticking, tearing, clumping - all contribute to product losses and take a bite out of the bottom line. Cryogenic Competitiveness \"The stuffed pasta market is very competitive. We've been working with Linde since we first entered cryogenic freezing more than 15 years ago, and they've always stepped up to the plate in trying to make us more efficient. So they've helped us grow, and they've increased our capacity for further growth -- and sometimes that's more important,\" says Gianni who assumed the helm as president after his father, Pierino, retired last year. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:50:06.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
