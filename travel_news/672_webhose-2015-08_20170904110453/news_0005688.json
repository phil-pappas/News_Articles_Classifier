One of the major reason for the rise, is the Parsi New year which falls immediately on Tuesday.\nAmit Taneja, chief revenue officer, Cleartrip said, “Indians have smartened up at taking extended weekend breaks by intelligent and advance holiday planning. With Independence Day on a Saturday and Parsi New Year on a Tuesday, most advance planners have taken the Monday off, to partake a four day long weekend getaway. On Cleartrip for travel between August 15-18, 2015, we have seen an over 10 per cent growth in overall bookings. Interestingly, when compared to bookings made only on Cleartrip Mobile, far more Indians booked their I-Day weekend in advance, through their smartphones. This year, the Cleartrip mobile share saw a phenomenal 77 per cent growth in bookings for the I-Day weekend, when compared to the same period last year. Advance planners stole the chunk of the pie. Over 43 per cent travellers had booked their holiday for this long weekend, almost 27-days in advance.
