So, what’s the chance you’d see a bear barrel rolling down a hill?\nA fun-loving grizzly playing up to the camera was captured on video enjoying himself in Denali National Park.\nIn the background, tourists can be heard laughing amid the clicks of digital cameras.\nThe video begins with a close up of the bear as he stumbles then realises that rolling down the hill was way more fun.\nThe group of stunned eyewitnesses can be heard laughing, with one saying: “I think he’s drunk.”\n“This is hilarious,” another adds.\nAfter the bear realises he has an audience, he sits up slightly dizzy and starts rolling once more. At one point the camera shot widens to see the tourists at a safe distance from the frolicking bear.\nBear rolls on down\nThe playful footage has become an internet hit and has been seen online more 800,000 times since it was uploaded on YouTube on Sunday.\nThere are around 300 to 350 grizzly bears in Denali.
