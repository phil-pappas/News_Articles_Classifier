Our hotels are also promoting 50 percent discounts and the hotel operators may also extend the promotion period if the demand is positive.\n“Therefore, I invite all Malaysians to visit Nepal as everywhere is safe and opened to be visited,” he added.\nNepal was hit by a massive earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale on April 25, killing 9,012 people including foreign tourists.\nMeanwhile, MATTA deputy president Rohizam Md Yusof said it would help to educate the local travel agents and operators to explore more tourism markets in Nepal. He said it was important for travel agents to understand the tourism products so as to suit Malaysians’ preferences.\nRohizam said there were many tourism products that could be explored by the Malaysian industry players to be promoted to their clients, such as suitable places for families, couples to go for honeymoon, religious products, natural places and extreme sports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:06:25.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
