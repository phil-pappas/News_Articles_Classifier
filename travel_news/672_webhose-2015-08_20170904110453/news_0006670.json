(Courtesy Help Find Alysson Mercier via Facebook) \nRelatives of a 20-year-old Canadian girl fear she has gone missing in Costa Rica after the family unexpectedly lost contact with her nearly three weeks ago. \nAlysson Mercier from Gatineau, Quebec reportedly arrived in Costa Rica on July 16 in the latest leg of a trip throughout Latin America that started in January. Mercer stopped updating her social media accounts and communicating with her family on July 19, according to Mercier’s aunt, Nancy Allard, in an interview with Quebec’s FM 1047 on Friday. According to Allard, Mercier was in San José the last time the family had contact with her. \nMercier had been checking in with her family everyday during her trip, Allard said. When three days passed without word, the family contacted the police. \nA Facebook page set up by the family on Thursday asking for information about Mercier’s whereabouts included a post from a user named Edgar Mata who claimed to have seen Mercier in La Fortuna, San Carlos , near Arenal Volcano, on Monday, July 20 when the two of them were on the same tour. \nAllard said the family was frustrated by the perceived lack of action from the Canadian Embassy in Costa Rica, including its decision to not issue a missing persons report. The Judicial Investigation Police (OIJ), which handles missing persons cases in Costa Rica, said in an email that it had not received a missing person report for Mercier as of Friday morning. \nCanadian Embassy spokeswoman Andrea Vásquez told The Tico Times that the embassy had received a missing person alert but did not comment further, citing Canadian privacy laws. \nMercier has traveled alone before, the family said in the radio interview, and had visited Cancún, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua before she arrived in Costa Rica. \nVisit the Help Find Alysson Mercier Facebook page to share any information about this case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:06:37.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
