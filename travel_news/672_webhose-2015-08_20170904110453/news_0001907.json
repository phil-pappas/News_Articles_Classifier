Artichoke is great for the liver and tomatoes are an antioxidant. SERVES Makes 2 large pizzas, serves 4 INGREDIENTS For the topping ½ onion, cut into large chunks 1 garlic clove, peeled 1 tsp avocado oil 4 large tomatoes, peeled, deseeded and roughly chopped ½ tsp dried oregano Pinch of Himalayan or Celtic salt (available from health food shops) 4 artichoke hearts in oil, drained, sliced 8 spring onions, sliced lengthways 2 tsp roughly chopped rosemary leaves 50g goat’s cheese (optional), crumbled or grated For the dough 250g wholegrain spelt flour, plus more to dust Pinch of Himalayan or Celtic salt 2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp coconut oil, melted METHOD Begin by making the sauce for the topping. Place the onion and garlic in the bowl of a food processor and blitz until finely puréed. Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the onion and garlic mix. Fry gently for five minutes, until cooked through and slightly golden. Meanwhile, blitz the tomatoes in a food processor until puréed. Add the tomatoes to the cooked onion mix, with the oregano and salt. Continue to cook the mixture until thickened; this should take about five minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 240C/fan 220C/475F/Gas 9. To make the dough, sift the flour into a mixing bowl and stir in the salt and baking powder. Make a well in the centre and pour in the oil and up to 150ml of warm filtered water to make a firm dough. Bring together with your hands, adding a little extra filtered water if necessary, and knead briefly. Halve the dough and roll out on two lightly floured, non-stick baking sheets into large rectangles. Spoon over the sauce and spread it over the base, then scatter the remaining toppings over the two pizzas. Bake in the oven for eight to 10 minutes, until the base is burnished and the toppings are golden. Serve immediately.
