The profusion of local coffee bars and mini-chains, as well as the presence of top names from around the country, means there is an abundance of cool or cozy spots for coffee connoisseurs looking to get a cup to go or to stay and while away an afternoon. The sheer number of options can be overhwhelming, though, so we've handpipcked our absolute favorites across the borough. Here are seven coffee shops where you'll find great ambiance and outstanding pours. Blue Bottle Coffee \nWhere: Boerum Hill and Williamsburg \nSelf-described coffee aficionados line up for the espresso and pour-overs at Blue Bottle , which originated in Oakland but feels very much at home in Williamsburg. The former factory building has light streaming in through large windows so the La Marzocco espresso machine seems to shine, and a Kyoto-style iced-coffee dripper, which looks like it belongs in a science lab, is displayed opposite the coffee counter. There's not much seating, so it's best to get your coffee and snack (mmmm, s'mores) to go. Beans are roasted in a vintage Probat roaster in back. Brooklyn Roasting Company \nWhere: DUMBO \nArtfully disheveled staffers brew coffee from fair-trade and rainforest alliance-certified beans, while local gallerists and start-up techies flirt over perfectly poured cortados and other beverages at this café adjacent to the East River. The loft-style, industrial space is filled with antique roasting equipment and ample seating. There are pastries and sandwiches as well. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s DUMBO Guide Devoción \nWhere: Williamsburg \nAt this coffee shop with roots in Bogotá, the beauty of the space is matched by the quality of the coffee, which comes exclusively from small farms in Colombia. Fresh beans are brought directly to Brooklyn, where they're roasted on site within a few days of arrival. Take a seat on one of the leather sofas under the skylight or at a table in front of the living wall and enjoy a cappuccino with one of the homemade medialunas or croissants. The stylish space has books, magazines, and even dominoes—perfect for a relaxing Sunday afternoon. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Williamsburg Guide Gorilla Coffee \nWhere: Park Slope \nThis popular Brooklyn-based brand has fueled Park Slope since 2002 with its specially blended roasts and beans from fair-trade cooperatives. Muffins and baked goods come from nearby Blue Sky Bakery . Business is brisk and the atmosphere is serious—those who stay plant themselves in the schoolroom-like rows of tablesand chairs and work until their MacBook batteries run out. The window seats and red benches outside are prime spots to watch the steady stream of foot traffic. There is another location at 472 Bergen Street (just off Flatbush Avenue), but this is the original. Little Skips \nWhere: Bushwick \nArtwork by local artists, some of them customers, hang on the wall at this popular hangout space that lures a large contingent of freelancers typing away on their laptops. The sandwiches are excellent, and gluten-free substitutes are available for an additional charge. Service can be slow, but there's plenty of people watching while you wait. Steeplechase \nWhere: Windsor Terrace \nServing coffee made from Brooklyn Roasting Company beans and pastries and bagels from the best Brooklyn bakeries, this is the perfect place to start the day or to perk up in the afternoon. Locals love to hang out with their laptops, but ample seating and a computer-free area mean you can almost always find space. Toby’s Estate \nWhere: Williamsburg \nWith four cafés in New York City, Toby's Estate is expanding quickly into a mini coffee empire that started in Brooklyn. The spacious location on North 6th Street is perennially packed, so you might have to wait for a seat to open up—but it's worth it, especially for a prime spot on the long, comfy couch. Light streaming in through large windows gives the place a bright, airy feel. The coffee drinks are outstanding, as are the made-to-order sandwiches (think egg on a roll with espresso-lacquered bacon) and salads. \nPhoto Credits (top to bottom): See Inside ; Kristina D.C.
