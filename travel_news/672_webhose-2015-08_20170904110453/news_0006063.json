So what are travellers' biggest pet peeves when it comes to hotels? \nFrequent Business Traveler magazine has released the results of its 2015 Hotel Pet Peeves Survey . \nComing out on top, as the biggest pet peeve, is expensive and/or slow Internet. \nSlow or expensive Internet is truly hated, as it has taken the number one spot for four years. It's especially annoying when you have work to do or would like to share your adventures online. \nComing in second place is hard-to-reach and/or insufficient electrical outlets. I know I often find myself searching every corner of the room for more outlets. \nIn third place is poor room cleanliness - which would personally be my first pet peeve. \nHere are the full top ten hotel pet peeves: \n1. Expensive and/or slow Internet 2. Hard-to-reach and/or insufficient electrical outlets 3. Poor room cleanliness 5. Climate control not easily adjustable 6. Noise of any kind 7. Insufficient water pressure or temperature 8. Unexpected fees (including resort fees) 9. Uncomfortable pillows 10. Insufficient or poor lighting \nWhat is your top hotel pet peeve?
