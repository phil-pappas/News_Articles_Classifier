What level of care will I receive? \nThe airline must provide food and drink appropriate to the time of day (this is often in the form of a voucher) and a means of communicating your delay or a refund of the cost of essential calls. \nFor overnight delays, the airline must provide hotel accommodation and transport to reach it - or to return home. When there’s a major disruption, airline staff may not be able to assist in booking hotels. In such cases, you can make your own arrangements and claim the cost back. But don’t expect a full refund for an expensive hotel unless there’s no alternative. Supporting receipts are essential. \n• The worst countries for flight delays What compensation am I entitled to? \nFor delays of three hours or more you are entitled to a cash payment of €250 (£180) for short flights and €400 (£280) for a flight distance of 1,500-3,500km. For flights of over 3,500km you will receive €300 (£210) for a delay of 3-4 hours; €600 (£420) for more than four hours. \nFor delays of three hours or more you are entitled to a cash payment of between £180 and £280 Photo: GETTY Are there exceptions? \nYes.The compensation is not payable in the case of an “extraordinary circumstance”. For example, when the delay is due to war or civil unrest, security issues, natural disasters (including bird strikes), weather conditions (including an airport’s failure to de-ice the aircraft on time), air traffic control restrictions, strikes by airport staff, a medical emergency on board, and some crew issues. So what is covered? \nMost things that are within the airline’s control including “unexpected flight safety shortcomings”. In June 2014 the Court of Appeal finally ruled on Jet2 vs Huzar and said compensation should be paid for delays caused by ordinary technical problems such as component failure and general wear and tear. \nThis ruling only applies in England and Wales but the rest of the UK is expected to abide by it. Court cases in Europe are achieving similar outcomes. I know my flight had a technical fault because the pilot said so. So why has my claim been refused due to a ‘hidden manufacturing defect’? \nThis is the new defence airlines are using to avoid paying out, but it is not washing with the courts. Judgements this year have made it quite clear that a hidden manufacturing defect is comparable to a product recall; it has to be initiated by the manufacturer. \n• 14 ways you're being ripped off at the airport Can I claim if my flight delay happened four years ago? \nYou can claim for qualifying delayed flights over the past six years. Wizz Air is refusing to accept claims over two years old but this is being challenged by the Hungarian authorities. Ryanair has just lost a similar case at Manchester County Court. \nYou can claim for delayed flights over the past six years Photo: GETTY Can I claim if I travelled on a codeshare flight? \nIt is the nationality of the airline operating the flight that applies. For example, if you are delayed on a flight from New York to London booked through British Airways but the operating carrier is American Airlines, you are not covered by the Regulation even if your e-ticket shows a BA flight number. Can I claim if a shorter delay means I miss a connecting flight? \nYes, if all the flights are made under the same booking reference and the connection is made at an EU airport. For example, if you are due to fly from London via Madrid to Buenos Aires and you miss your connection in Madrid because the flight from London arrives an hour late, you can claim for long-haul compensation as long as the delay in arriving at your final destination, in this case Buenos Aires, is more than three hours. Can I claim for a delayed flight outside the EU on a non-EU airline if my journey began in the UK? \nIt depends. If, for example, you were flying London-Dubai-Singapore and your London-Dubai flight arrived more than three hours late you can make a claim. However, if the delay was on the Dubai-Singapore sector you would not be eligible for compensation. There is also no compensation for delays on any sector of your return flight to the UK. The airline has offered me vouchers as compensation, what should I do? \nIt is your choice whether to accept them or not. The Regulation says that the airline should pay compensation in cash. \nThere is currently a big backlog of cases Photo: GETTY I have submitted a compensation claim to the airline but it says the delay was due to ‘extraordinary circumstances’. What do I do next? \nDouble-check that you have a case by reading through the CAA’s ‘Delays and Cancellations’ information at caa.co.uk/passengers . If your delayed flight departed from a UK airport you can ask the CAA’s travel advice team (020 7453 6888; caa.co.uk ) to review your case and it will contact the airline on your behalf if you have a valid claim. There is currently a big backlog of cases so you may have to wait two months for a response. \nIf your flight departed from another EU country you need to contact the National Enforcement Body (NEB) in the country where the airline has its home base. The NEB will eventually - usually months later - provide a written ruling on your claim. This is not legally binding but most airlines pay out at this point.
