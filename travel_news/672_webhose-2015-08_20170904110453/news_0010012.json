The powerful and majestic Colorado River begins from snow-fed streams and rivers that flow from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. The Colorado Rivers flows over 1,400 miles through many types of natural terrain. For Southern California campers, Russ and Lori suggest looking into the Lower Colorado River campgrounds. These destinations are an easy partial day drive from anywhere in Southern California. The Lower Colorado begins at the river exit of The Grand Canyon and flows hundreds of miles that border the states of California, Arizona, and Nevada. Virtually any type of camping can be experienced along the Colorado River. The river’s journey contains a variety of calm waters, raging rapid areas, to beautiful lakes and reservoirs. Depending on your taste of relaxation or adventures, recreational camping can be found to suit your desires. For full hook-up RV parks where you also have swimming pools and park recreation activities, choose from many RV parks that have TV, Wi-Fi, exercise areas, games rooms, and community activities. There are parks right on the river. Russ and Lori suggest the Parker and Lake Havasu area campgrounds where you have it all. Next, are the public campgrounds that are on public lands along miles and miles of the Colorado River. Usually, these camp spots are for tents or self-contained RV use. Many sites have picnic tables and fire rings. A few sites have electric and water hook-up available. If you really want to get back to nature, try some \"Dispersed Camping.\" This type of camping is a trip. The Bureau of Land Management allows for camping on its lands unless otherwise posted. Be sure to choose a spot that is free on vegetation and is hard packed. Using previous fire rings prevents land scorching that take years to erase. You can stay up to 14 days in one location. If more time is needed, you must move to a new location at least 25 miles away. You can find this type of camping along the shores of Lake Havasu, and lands between Cibola National Wildlife Refuge and Ehrenberg. Desert camping along the Colorado River is awesome during warm winter days. The temperatures can be in the 60’s or 70’s. The river lazily flows along the Mojave Desert in this area. Permits are not needed for camping in this back country, but campsites must be at least 100 feet from the water. In any season along the Colorado River, be prepared and do your homework about weather conditions. Especially during the summer season, many areas of the Colorado River can experience air temperatures approaching 120 degrees. Evenings may not even dip below 90 degrees, many times staying around 100 degrees at night. Ensure that you have plenty of fluids, wear sunscreen, use hats, and use lightweight quick-drying clothing. You can take frequent dips in the river with synthetic material clothes, as you can wring them out and they stay slightly damp. If you wear cotton type clothing you will just be grumpy and mess up the karma of the trip. Russ and Lori recommend the pleasant winter days at the river. With evening temperatures in the high 40’s or low 50’s, it is the perfect combination of comfortable days and sitting by a cozy fire at night. Boating adventures are available from personal watercraft, small boats, or guided tours. Personal watercraft can be a little pricey to rent. Russ and Lori are advocates of boating safety. Please know the rules and laws of operating a personal watercraft or boat before renting. For a laid-back adventure with an experienced captain at the helm, we suggest the jet boat tour out of Laughlin, Nevada. The jet boats hold about 20 people, with an exhilarating ride up to London Bridge and back. The tour takes about 3-5 hours. A stop is included where you can do a little shopping or enjoy lunch. The Colorado River is beautiful, so Let’s Get Rollin’!
