Mix it with sustained intensity and Richmond found the formula to control Hawthorn.\nThe committed Tigers stunned the seemingly invincible AFL premier with confronting pressure from the opening bounce at the MCG.\nIt delivered an 18 points triumph that will be picked apart by every top eight contender over the weekend.\nThe Tigers sensed the Hawks’ vulnerability from the start and harassed them for every possession and refused to give it up when they had the ball.\nHawthorn didn’t score a goal at the city end for the entire night as the disjointed forward set-up was contained by Richmond’s defence so ably led by Alex Rance.\nBachar Houli celebrates his goal during the third quarter.

Source: News Corp Australia\nAny doubts that this Richmond unit are the real deal were dispelled with the almost fanatical commitment to coach Damien Hardwick’s bold run-and-spread plan.\nSo often, the Hawks merely booted the ball high in hope into the forward 50 where only Jack Gunston and occasionally the opportunist Cyril Rioli posed a threat.\nTo compound the massive wake-up call, Hawk key defenders Brian Lake and returning James Frawley were reported for unusual rough conduct offences.\nBrian Lake reported for Irish whip on Tyrone Vickery 0:48 Play video\nAFL: Hawthorn Hawk's Brian Lake was put on report after this push on Richmond forward Tyrone Vickery.\nFox Sports 31 Jul 2015 Sport/AFL/News This was so uncharacteristic Hawthorn - fumbles by normally clean ball handlers like Rioli and Bradley Hill, miskicks from the ever-reliable Grant Birchall out of defence and Shaun Burgoyne seemingly unaware he was about to be run down from behind.\nIt was another howler from Josh Gibson from deep in defence that was intercepted by the Tigers and allowed Kane Lambert to stroll into an open goal to stretch the lead to 18 points heading into the final term.\nJack Riewoldt flew high but he couldn’t pull down this mark. Picture: Wayne Ludbey. Source: News Corp Australia\nLake was booked by the non-controlling field umpire when he pushed Ty Vickery into the fence after a contest close to the boundary line in the third quarter.\nIt proved a telling free kick as Vickery ran around to curl a crucial goal that kick-started Richmond’s momentum early in the second half.\nFrawley endured a horror return after a month out with the dislocated shoulder to be in a world of hurt again.\nHe coughed up the first goal of the game after being caught in a Brett Deledio tackle and then was put on report for what seemed a legitimate tackle on Jack Riewoldt early in the second quarter.\nAnd he was on the bench at the half-time siren for the mandatory concussion test when felled by an accidental knee to the back of the head in a marking contest late in the term.\nFrawley and his fellow defenders had to work overtime in the first half in the face of Richmond’s high-tempo game plan based on intense pressure and spread to use the MCG’s wide flanks.\nThe Tigers caught the normally composed Hawks by surprise by denying the premier the ball in a stunning and sustained performance.\nBrett Deledio kicked the opening three goals of the game and finished with four. Pic: Michael Klein Source: News Corp Australia\nWhen Riewoldt missed with a set shot after five minutes for the opening score, Richmond led the disposal count by a staggering 43-10. Another indicator of the Hawks’ jitters was captain Luke Hodge’s clearing kick being spoiled to set up the second of Deledio’s three goals in the first quarter.\nHawthorn was goalless at quarter-time for the first time this season. And the rare humiliation was always going to sting such a proud group.\nEven when Riewoldt goalled to stretch the Tigers’ lead to 25 points early in the second quarter, the Hawks showed signs of getting better organised, particularly in the midfield and down back.\nIt took Hawthorn seven minutes into the second quarter to post the first goal from a hurried shot from Ryan Schoenmakers that bounced across the line.\nTwo more from Jack Gunston set shots and contributions from Paul Puopolo and Rioli gave the revived Hawks four of the last five goals before the long break to set up an intriguing second half contest. Whether Richmond could sustain their tempo against the inevitable challenge was answered in emphatic style.\nAlex Rance gets his handball away under pressure from Jack Gunston. Picture: Wayne Ludbey.
