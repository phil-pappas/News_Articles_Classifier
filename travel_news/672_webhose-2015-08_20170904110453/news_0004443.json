We have all adopted this strategy that we need to put people at the center of our development, but when we put them in the center of our tourism development, we are putting culture in the center of our development,” he said. \nMinister St.Ange added that there can be no culture without its people. \nHe said the four countries will nominate an event of their respective countries which will now be staged in collaboration with the East3Route program. \n“It will help Seychelles to get its culture groups and artists to be in Kwazulu-Natal, Swaziland, and Mozambique to perform alongside the best ones, and the same will apply for all the three countries,” he said. \nHe added that now the Vanilla Islands organisation will be affiliated with the East3Route through its member, which is Seychelles. \n“We are growing the family, but it is for one purpose of us working together. The friendly ties are consolidated when the people know each other,” he said. \n“We must action to make these dreams a reality. To make it a reality, we need action, action, and action, as echoed during the East3Route investment seminar which took place at the Savoy Resort and Spa the previous day.” \nMinister St.Ange added that it has been a dream to have the East3Route investment seminar in Seychelles. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
