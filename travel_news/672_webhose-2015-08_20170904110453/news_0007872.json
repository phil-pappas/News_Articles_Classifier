Spain - Eating in Spanish Restaurants \nIn the summer, Spanish eating habits can be daunting for the tourist, especially one just arriving from overseas. Lunch and dinner are served later here than in the rest of Europe, restaurants often opening as late as 3pm for lunch and 8 or 9pm for dinner. Many restaurants in metropolitan areas have started to cater to the overseas crowd and offer continuous opening hours. The traditional remedy for the lateness of meals was to eat small plates called tapas at bars that were open all day, either as a way to keep hunger away until the restaurants opened or to make a whole meal out of appetizers--not a bad way to go. Bellying up to a Tapas bar is a great way to meet people. \nMany travelers report not finding enough vegetables in restaurants to keep them happy. This is not the case when you eat meals in people's homes--it's a quirk of the restaurant system. See Eating in Spain for more. Tipping in Spanish Restaurants \nMeals include a service charge, but tipping is common. 10% is a substantial tip. Accommodations in Spain \nSpain has a wide range of accommodations.
