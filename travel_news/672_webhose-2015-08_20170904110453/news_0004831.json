We want to provide comfortable accommodation and enhance the quality of travel experience for our guests. \nCharacteristics of Guest Rooms \nWe offer three types of accommodation to meet various tourists’ needs: Bunk Bed, Compact Room, and Standard Room. Bunk Bed type pursues comfortable accommodation at a reasonable price (from 3,900 yen/person). Compact Room type provides private rooms for guests who value their privacy (from 5,800 yen/person). Standard Room type offers single and double private rooms equipped a bath or shower (from 8,000 yen/person). In the Bunk Bed and Compact Room types, women-only floors are available. \nCharacteristics of Common Spaces \nAt our dining space on the first floor, we offer food, drinks, and services that allow our guests to feel the connection to the community and identity of the area. \nClick here for details.（ http://www.on-the-marks.jp ） \nAbout HotelOpening date: September 16, 2015Number of guest rooms: 226 \nUDS Ltd. plans, designs, and operates various real estates and architectures in Japan and abroad, including hotels, offices, commercial facilities, restaurants, and residential buildings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:12:11.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
