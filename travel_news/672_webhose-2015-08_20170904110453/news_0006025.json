This partnership will encourage more Kiwis to hop across the ditch to Sydney and also to explore greater NSW with our alliance partner Virgin Australia.”\nIn the year to March 2015, visitors from New Zealand stayed a total of 4.5 million nights in NSW and spent $473 million during their stay. The average length of stay for visitors from New Zealand to NSW was 11 nights.\nAir New Zealand and alliance partner Virgin Australia operate direct flights to Sydney from the major cities of Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch and Queenstown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:15:24.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
