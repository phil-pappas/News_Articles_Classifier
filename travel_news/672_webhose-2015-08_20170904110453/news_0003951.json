Aggressive production goals for sugar cane and other crops spoiled rivers and natural landscapes and unleashed extensive soil erosion. \nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 cut off critical assistance to Cuba, including fuel, chemicals and machinery. With little choice, Cuba began a green transformation, turning from big tractors to oxen and horses. \nIn 1992, at a United Nations summit in Rio de Janeiro, Castro delivered an impassioned speech about the planet's plummeting health. \n\"The forests are disappearing. The deserts are expanding. Billions of tons of fertile soil are washed every year into the sea. Numerous species are becoming extinct,\" Castro said. \nA few years later, Cuba established a ministry for environmental protection, which led to an overarching law that spawned a host of specific protections that are \"every bit as far reaching as those in the U.S.,\" Whittle said. \nCuba's environmental agencies came to be staffed, not surprisingly in a nation of free education, by qualified employees. \nOne of them, Sonia Orue, said at the environmental conference that her agency ensures that environmental education starts at an early age in Cuban schools. \nOrue studied in Holland and Brazil and has advanced degrees in chemical engineering, waste management and risk management. \nAlso at the conference was Sebastian Africano, who lives in Colorado and is international director for Trees, Water & People, a group working to improve sustainability of communities. He focuses on household energy and reforestation in Central America. \n\"I'm blown away,\" Africano said, during a conference break, of Cuba's environmental laws and expertise. \"They are very sophisticated.\" \nWhittle, who has made more than 60 trips to Cuba in the past 15 years, said there is vigorous debate among leaders over whether to fully embrace tourism as the economic driver or strike a more careful balance between tourism development and conservation. \nHe predicts some of that will be resolved next April during what will be only the seventh congress of Cuba's communist party. \n\"The U.S. won't determine Cuba's future,\" Whittle said. \"The Cuban people will do that. The Cuban government will do that. And nobody has a crystal ball to say what they will do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:16:58.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
