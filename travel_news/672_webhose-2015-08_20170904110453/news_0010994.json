VR, also known as computer-simulated life, was first popularised by science fiction novels in the 1950s and has been used in several fields, such as pilot training, since the 1990s. Yet the sector has grown in popularity since Facebook purchased VR hardware developer Oculus for $2 billion (£1.2 billion) in March last year. ... Chinese manufacturers have been supplying the domestic demand for VR gaming products The Oculus Rift, which is scheduled for release in early 2016, has been dubbed one of the first consumer-targeted VR headsets. However, as such equipment is not yet in mass production, Chinese manufacturers have been supplying the domestic demand for VR gaming products. Baofeng Technology, based in Beijing, was one of about 20 companies that displayed VR products this year at ChinaJoy, an annual digital entertainment expo that ran from July 30 to Aug 2. The cost reduction in Chinese VR products is one of the reasons behind the growing popularity A representative for Baofeng said it had already sold more than 300,000 units of its first-generation VR headset, the Magic Mirror, since its debut in September. “The cost reduction in Chinese VR products is clearly one of the reasons behind the growing popularity,” said Weng Dongdong, an associate professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. He explained that prices of some headsets had fallen from more than 100,000 yuan (£10,130) to just 2,000 yuan. “The development of VR headgear is also likely to act as a trigger for the commercialisation of the entire hardware chain.” Wang Qifan contributed to this story, which was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:24:46.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
