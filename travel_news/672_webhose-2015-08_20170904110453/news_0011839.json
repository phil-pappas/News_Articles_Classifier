It illustrates the unique and special relationship that our two countries share, based on our shared values and aspirations. It is a relationship which is strategic, historical, multi-faceted, and longstanding. The vibrant Indian community in Seychelles, which is part and parcel of the long history of our country and which shapes our common destiny, is a catalyst in bolstering this strategic partnership and our convergent bilateral interests.” \nMr. Michel expressed Seychelles’ appreciation for the financial support of India, which he said will make a significant contribution to the socio-economic development of Seychelles. \n“I have expressed my gratitude for India’s commitment to further expand its partnership in the development of human resources and capacity building. This will help us to reinforce our resilience as a nation and to meet our vision of people-centered development. I have also expressed my gratitude for the donation of another Dornier aircraft.

I am also delighted to reciprocate President Michel’s exceptional hospitality in March this year. He has led his country with great vision. He is a strong global voice of concern on climate change, especially for small island countries. Excellency, just as we appreciate your country’s beauty, we admire your nation’s progress. Let me repeat what I said in Seychelles: Your country shows that size is no barrier to the scale of achievements. President Michel has also been instrumental for the progress in our relationship. We value this greatly, because Seychelles is a key strategic partner for India.” \nMr. Modi announced that India will gift one more Interceptor Coastguard boat to Seychelles, in addition to the Dornier aircraft that was announced in March. \nFurthermore Prime Minister Modi added: “Our bilateral agreement for cooperation on the Blue Economy is a huge step forward in our relationship and in promoting sustainable ocean economy in the region. We look forward to cooperating in space, including in the areas of managing land and marine resources, fisheries advisory, weather forecasting, and disaster management. We have begun preparations for infrastructure development on the Assumption Island in Seychelles. … I am confident that this milestone year for our relationship will be the springboard for taking our strategic partnership to a new level.” \nThe working lunch was also attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Transport, Mr. Joel Morgan; the Minister for Finance, Trade & the Blue Economy, Mr. Jean-Paul Adam; the President’s Diplomatic Adviser, Ambassador Callixte d’Offay; the Chief Military Adviser to the President, Colonel Clifford Roseline; the Seychelles High Commissioner to India, Mr. Waven William; the Chief Press Secretary in the Office of the President, Ms. Srdjana Janosevic; the Presidential Envoy for Climate Change and the Environment, Dr. Nirmal Jivan Shah; the CEO of the Seychelles Investment Board, Mr. Rupert Simeon; and the CEO of the Islands Development Company, Mr. Glenny Savy. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
