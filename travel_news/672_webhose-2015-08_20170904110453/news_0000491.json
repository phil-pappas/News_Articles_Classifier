Unite members voted by 52% to 48% to accept the improved offer. \nThe Unite union warned bosses that the revised deal should serve as a “wake-up call”. \nUnite regional officer Kevin Hall said: “While we are pleased that the dispute is settled and there will be no disruption for those jetting away on their summer holidays, this dispute is a wake-up call to the management. \n“The company needs to start smelling the coffee about the pay and conditions of its staff that emerged during this dispute when it comes to future pay claims. This highly profitable company got away with a settlement by the skin of its teeth.” \nUnite cabin crew operate from 11 UK bases: Belfast, Bristol, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Liverpool, Luton, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Southend andStansted. \nIn a statement easyJet added: “EasyJet values the contribution its cabin crew make and is pleased to have reached a positive conclusion so that its crew can continue to provide the excellent, friendly service our passengers expect and they can have complete reassurance that their travel plans will not be disrupted this summer.” Readers' comments (1) race welch | Tue, 4 Aug 2015 12:05 pm \nThis is indeed great news for the cabin crew and their customers, however, you can see the bully boy tactics are still securely in place by the likes of Unite who have the loony left as their voice of threats and confrontation continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:52:32.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
