Hong Kong , Tokyo and Bangkok had an increase in hotel demand climbing two, five and 12 spots, respectively in the latest Hotels.com™ Hotel Price Index™ (HPI™).\n\"Historically Asian countries have offered great value for accommodation, making them popular among travellers looking to explore a unique, new culture,\" says Taylor L. Cole , APR, travel expert for Hotels.com. \"With Canada's strong Asian economic ties, naturally business travel remains strong too, especially with the Canadian government's support of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) business travel card.\"\nOutside of Asia , the Italian city of Rome experienced the largest growth climbing four spots in 2015, followed by Amsterdam which was a new addition to the top 20 list.\nMost Popular International Cities for Canadian Travellers\nCity\nCountry\n2015 vs. 2014 Rank\n1.
