Even though climbing a mountain should never be taken lightly, the reality is that almost anyone can embark on a memorable journey towards an imposing mountain peak. The secret to hiking lies in simple things, such as passion for nature, will for adventure, and responsibility (staying safe up there is the most important of all).\nFor first-time mountain climbers, Eastern Europe is a great option.

Rysy lies at the border between Poland and Slovakia and can be accessed via Zakopane, a town located not far from Krakow, or via the town of Strbske Pleso (in Slovakia). “The great thing about the beautiful Rysy peaks is that they are reachable through Poland as well as via Slovakia.” The mountain has three famous peaks and each of them can be the target of a great hike. The north-western peak is the tallest in Poland, at an altitude of 2,499 meters (8,199 ft). The other two peaks belong to the Slovak region of Presov.\nThe great thing about the beautiful Rysy peaks is that they are reachable through Poland as well as via Slovakia.

Hiking Moldoveanu requires no special skills and no technical climbing, yet reaching it via the small town of Victoria (a bus ride away from Brasov) can take about two days. “Hiking Moldoveanu requires no special skills and no technical climbing…” Hiking Moldoveanu is also possible by taking a car ride during the summer all the way to Balea Lake (on the famous Transfagarasan Road).
