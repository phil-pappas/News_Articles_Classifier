(Photo: WONG MAYE-E, AP)\n8 CONNECT 42 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Airlines are fighting a request from a consumer group that asked the Transportation Department to cap change fees on international tickets at $100.\nThe group FlyersRights.org filed the petition in February because change fees are growing and totaled nearly $3 billion in 2014. Paul Hudson, the group’s president, argued that international change fees reach as high as $750 and have no relation to the cost of actually changing a ticket.\nBut two major trade groups, Airlines for America and the International Air Transport Association, which represent 250 carriers, recently urged the department to reject the request\nThe airlines argued that setting a cap would disrupt highly competitive pricing and intrude on international agreements.\nAirlines “believe that DOT both can and should reject the petition’s invitation to engage in a piecemeal, unilateral intervention into international fares and fare rules,” according to the 15-page reply dated July 21 and posted Aug. 19.\nThe department has no schedule for reaching a decision, but has been reluctant to tamper with airline finances since Congress deregulated the industry in 1978.\nThe department rejected similar petitions in 2012 and 2003, finding that travelers can choose between non-refundable and more expensive refundable options.\nIf the department rejects the petition, FlyersRights could potentially appeal in federal court.\nFlyersRights argues that federal law allows the department to regulate international aviation to “establish reasonable rates and rules” and “to take action directly against unfiled passenger fees and rules.”\nKey phrasing in federal law says the department “may conduct a hearing to decide whether a price for foreign air transportation … is unlawful” and “may suspend a tariff.”\nBut industry officials have said the fees are both a way to cover costs of changing flights and also discouraging last-minute changes so that airlines can be confident of flying with the fullest planes possible.\nAirlines contend in their filing that so-called Open Skies agreements for unhindered flying with 109 foreign countries prevent capping change fees. “Use-it-or-lose-it” fares enable airlines to better predict how full their planes will be.\n“It could become attractive for scheduled airlines, like charter operations, to foreclose any changes to low fare tickets if DOT were to impose an arbitrary change fee cap,” the airlines wrote in a filing from Jeffrey Shane, IATA's general counsel, David Berg, A4A's general counsel, and lawyers Bert Rein and Bruce McDonald.\n8 CONNECT 42 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1F2RSRx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1F2RSRx&text=Airlines%20fight%20consumer%20request%20to%20DOT%20to%20cap%20change%20fees%20on%20international%20tickets&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1F2RSRx&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763567097294469-AP-SINGAPORE-AIRLINES-9303683.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b5a8bc887bc6ab6d08912bf0c6086e5e622d2eaa/c=70-0-953-664&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763567097294469-AP-SINGAPORE-AIRLINES-9303683.JPG", "http://usat.ly/1F2RSRx"], "published": "2015-08-28T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:18:47.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
