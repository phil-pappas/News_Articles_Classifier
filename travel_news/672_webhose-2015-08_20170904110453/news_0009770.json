Some 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain fell on the mountainous island.\n“The extent of the devastation is monumental. It is far worse than expected,” he said, adding that hundreds of homes, bridges and roads have been destroyed. “We have, in essence, to rebuild Dominica.”\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time At least 31 people have been reported missing, according to officials with the Barbados-based Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency.\nThe island’s airports remained closed, and some communities remained isolated by flooding and landslides.\nSkerrit asked people to share their resources with each other as foreign aid trickles in.\n“This is a period of national tragedy,” he said. “Floods swamped villages, destroyed homes and wiped out roads. Some communities are no longer recognizable.”\nErika still carried enough force to knock out power to more than 200,000 people in Puerto Rico and cause more than $16 million in damage to crops there, including plantains, bananas and coffee.\nWhile the storm was stumbling over the Dominican Republic and Haiti, John Cagialosi, a hurricane specialist at the center, warned that people in Florida should still brace for heavy rain, said “This is a potentially heavy rain event for a large part of the state,” he said.\nFlorida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for the entire state and officials urged residents to fill gas tanks and stockpile food and water.\nErika is a particularly wet storm, and its moving across a region that has been struggling with drought.\nGiven how weak the storm now is and how dry Puerto Rico and parts of Florida have been, “it could be a net benefit, this thing,” said MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel.\nThe center of Erika was located about 75 miles (125 kilometers) south of Guantanamo, Cuba, and was moving west-northwest at about 20 mph (31 kph), the Hurricane Center said early Saturday. The storm’s maximum sustained winds dropped slightly to 40 mph (65 kph).\nThe Hurricane Center said the center of Erika will move over portions of eastern Cuba on Saturday and move across central Cuba Saturday night.\nMeanwhile in the Pacific, Jimena turned into a powerful Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 125 mph (205 kph), and the Hurricane Center said it was likely to be near Category 5 status soon, though it did not pose an immediate threat to land.\n___\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
