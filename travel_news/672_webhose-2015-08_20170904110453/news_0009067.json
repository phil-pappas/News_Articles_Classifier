It said it would return cash to shareholders. \nThe Australian carrier has also placed an order for eight Boeing Dreamliners. \nQantas’ return to profitability has been aided by low fuel prices as well as tough cost-cutting measures. The airline has also been aggressively reducing jobs, cutting capacity and altering its frequent flyer programme, the BBC said. \nChief executive Alan Joyce said the acquisition of eight next-generation Boeing Dreamliners marked the scale of Qantas’ turnaround and signalled a new phase of renewal and growth. \n“We are delivering one of the biggest turnarounds in Australia’s corporate history,” he said. \n“This is the best first half [financial] result in four years and the best second half result in the company’s history.” \nQantas had previously postponed plans to refresh its fleet of 11 Boeing 747s on long-haul flights, and it now has another 12 options for the Dreamliner from 2017, alongwith a further 30 purchase rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:42:10.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
