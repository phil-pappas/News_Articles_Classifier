The habits of Caraxes jasius details. The caterpillar feeds exclusively on the leaves of Arbutus; therefore, its geographical distribution is almost identical to that of the shrub. The caterpillars of Caraxes jasius are solitary, if two individuals meet, they push against the head chief; then everyone goes their own way. Adult males are very pugnacious; when choosing a territory defend doggedly chasing other males and even birds (hoopoe); happened to have given a shot of \"wings even in the face of an intruder ... human.
