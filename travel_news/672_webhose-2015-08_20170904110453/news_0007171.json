Six cases of typhoid were confirmed by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which gained access to residents from the Yarmouk camp for the first time since June in nearby Yalda , where it carried out more than 200 medical consultations. Typhoid is contracted by drinking or eating contaminated matter and symptoms include nausea, fever, and abdominal pain. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications in the gut and head which can kill up to one in five patients. \"Our concern is that these typhoid cases only represent the tip of the iceberg, because the erosion of health services and appalling public health standards create a massive, massive risk of diseases breaking out,\" said Chris Gunness, UNWRA spokesman. \"The situation is desperate, and suffering may be far more widespread and intense inside the camp,\" Mr Gunness told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Jerusalem. The camp, set up close to Damascus in 1957 to house Palestinian refugees, has become a symbol of the desperate plight of people in rebel-held territory since the Syrian government laid siege to it in 2013. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters attacked the camp in April but withdrew soon afterwards having largely defeated their rival, Aknaf al Maqdis, leaving the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra as the biggest force in the camp.

More than 95 per cent of Palestinian refugees in the camp rely on the UN agency to provide them with daily supplies of food, water and health care, according to Mr Gunness.
