The opening will take Regus’ number of UK centres to over 320, as demand for flexible working continues to increase. Livingston is known for its vibrant business environment particularly popular with companies in the design and technology sectors. \nThe centre is situated in the middle of a popular business park enabling easy access. It is also convenient for guests of the nearby Premier Inn hotel. The site offers a range of flexible working options for businesses and professionals including meeting rooms bookable by the hour, co-working spaces, office space, day offices and virtual office services. Demand for flexible workspace is growing steadily, as businesses aim to save money on lengthy leases and give employees’ greater freedom in where and when they work. Research from Regus shows that 40% of UK workers spend at least 2.5 days per week working outside of their main office. Similarly, a third of UK employers are offering their staff more flexible working options. Technology makes it possible to ‘work anywhere’, yet most people prefer an office-style environment to remain productive, motivated and disciplined. Richard Morris, UK CEO, Regus, comments: “The opening of another Scottish centre testifies to the need for bespoke and dedicated business spaces that match today’s flexible workforce. We know that more and more people are working flexibly, instead of the traditional 9-5 in the office, and we are seeing month-on-month growth in interest in flexible working options which provide a more cost effective alternative to fixed offices.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:19:49.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
