No new start date was set but Underground officials are hoping for an agreement this fall. \nUnion members walked off the job twice this summer amid a dispute about how to implement a new 24-hour service on weekends. Unions have been demanding concessions to address work-life balance issues. Transport officials say they've offered a salary increase and bonuses to compensate for the shift changes. \nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson has said he \"wasn't fussed\" about an exact launch date.
