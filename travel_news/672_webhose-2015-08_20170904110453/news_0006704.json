The next pub was hundreds of miles away, and besides, I’d only ordered a coffee.\nWe’d just arrived from Melbourne, more than 600 miles and 11 hours to the south by road. Our designated driver was pilot Dave from Lilydale Air Services, who had just landed our sturdy little six-seater Beechcraft on a dirt strip across the road. Dave was on soft drinks until the end of the day.\nThe point was to get a panoramic view of the outback in all its vast variety. Our three-day crawl would take us to a dozen pubs.\nWe’d left a lush landscape hatched with vines to fly at low level over a territory of arid beauty, stippled with the green of feathery gum trees, scored by the writhing lines of watercourses waiting for rare rainfall. The terrain offered only the occasional wink of a waterhole.\nWe were headed for still more remote places, where any request for a latte would be thought lah-di-dah.\nThe thinly populated Red Centre of Australia has a rough and ready culture all its own. Much of that is found in remote pubs that are sometimes battered bungalows with corrugated roofs, and sometimes dignified century-old buildings in solid limestone, whose staff might be a hamlet’s only population.\nSome pubs are popular with riotous backpacker bus tours that take the few paved routes crossing the emptiness. Others sit at the center of cattle stations the size of small European countries, whose stockmen travel as much as 60 miles to what it seems inappropriate to call their “local.”\nThe century-old pub at our next stop, Tilpa, was deserted, and the neighboring cemetery emptier still, with not a single gravestone. But the pub’s battered interior was covered — walls, ceiling and furniture — with the signatures of passers-by who had earned permission to scribble by paying a contribution to the Royal Flying Doctor Service.\nOther surprises included one of Muhammad Ali’s boxing gloves in a glass case, and the ability to fish directly from the rear veranda into the gelatinous Darling River.\nWe only paused at Bourke to refuel, and to consider that north of here we’d be officially remote even by Australian standards. “Back of Bourke” is Australian for “back of beyond.”\nOutback pubs typically have their names painted on their roof, along with any radio frequency they may monitor. Use of that, or simply diving down to buzz the pub, will bring the owner out to collect thirsty customers. At Ford’s Bridge, we were driven a few minutes to the 145-year-old Warrego Hotel, the last surviving mud-brick pub in Australia.\nIts walls were hung with sheep shears and horseshoes, and black-and-white photographs of the historic Ghan railway and the camel trains that used to collect freight at remote stations and haul it off to places more remote still.\nThe light was fading so we drank hastily, but we still reached Toompine in Queensland only just before dark, setting off to walk down a dusty track before weaving headlights indicated the imminent arrival of a ride. The driver was a pub customer unable to tell us how to open the gate at the rear of a vehicle obviously used for transporting animals.\n“I only stole it a couple of minutes ago,” he explained.\nGreat things were expected of Toompine, and by 1891 it had several houses, a pub, blacksmith, stables, butcher and watchmaker — and a police station where it was most needed, opposite the pub. All that remains today is the pub from 1893 — “The Local with No Locals,” according to a framed newspaper clipping — where a lively crowd of overnight visitors was watching Aussie rules football on television while tucking into vast orders of steak and pies.\nAnother customer drove us out to the airstrip in the morning. “Land here at night and you’d mince about fifty ’roos, I reckon,” he said. Even in daylight many pubs do a “’roo run” to drive wildlife off the runway.\nHe detoured slightly to show us his work with a road-grading machine, although this didn’t make sense until we were airborne.\nCattle stations and remote homesteads have their own strips, and sometimes from the air, the pinkish-ochre land looks like skin patched up with multiple band-aids. From the air we saw a giant smiley face carved into the soft pink soil to indicate that this was the strip for a warm welcome.\nAt Noccundra, we taxied from the airstrip right up to the front door of the smart little limestone pub, which was lost in the middle of a cattle station of more than 2 million acres.\n“How’s that for timing,” said pilot Dave. “It’s just opening time.”\nToompine had had instant coffee only, but here, new lessees up from Melbourne had brought relative sophistication to the menu, along with an espresso machine and a wide choice of wines, although reportedly some of the clientele were struggling to keep up. The tenth time someone asked what a baguette was they’d taken it off the menu again.\nThe next stop was at one of Australia’s more sober historic sites, the Dig Tree. The first transcontinental overland crossing by European settlers was heroically chaotic.\nIts leaders, Burke and Wills, eventually died on their return journey, nor far from a tree where provisions for them had been buried, with the still-visible message “Dig” carved into its trunk.\nIt seemed inappropriate to dine well on smoked salmon, avocado and goat cheese salad only a few minutes away at Innamincka, amid images of Burke and Wills, who had died in 1861 partly of hunger and thirst.\nStill more bizarre, at Broken Hill, a metropolis by outback standards, the Palace Hotel’s lobby and stairwell had a copy of Botticelli’s Birth of Venus on the ceiling. Every other square inch was painted with kangaroo-filled landscapes, all made famous in the cult movie The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert .\nIn the outback there may be few people, but there are many surprises. If you want to get off the beaten track, then forsake tracks altogether and take to the air.\nWhen you go Lilydale Air Services’ air safaris or pub crawls start from Lilydale Airport in the wine-producing Yarra Valley just outside Melbourne. There are occasional scheduled trips, but owner Jonathan Merridew can plan a route suited to your preference for beer, outback culture and history, creature comforts or a combination of all three.\nWe made 12 stops in three states over three days, but the length of trip and number of stops is flexible, and there are aircraft to suit various group sizes. Outback accommodations range from budget and very basic to luxury lodges, and meals from filling roadside eating to fine dining that urban Australians fly in to experience.
