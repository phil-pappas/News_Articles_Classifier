It attracts a lot of tourists. \n“We’re looking at growing the market more aggressively and I think there’s a huge potential as well from the UK taking into account the relationship we have.” \nAl Hajry added plans were also afoot to widen the range of accommodation in order to attract more than the luxury market to Oman. \nShe said: “We do have five star and four-star (accommodation) but … the government has to expand that. We do have a number of projects in the pipeline to increase the potential.” \nAl Hajry added Oman is also using its growing reputation as a competitive sailing nation to also drive tourist numbers. \nShe said tour operators were invited to join employees from both the Oman Ministry of Tourism, Oman Air and Oman Sail at Cowes Week to experience the sultanate’s MOD70 Musandam sailing yacht. \nRepresentatives from Neilsons, Audley Travel and Turquoise Holidays all partook, as well as a schools operator Travelbound.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T03:49:01.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
