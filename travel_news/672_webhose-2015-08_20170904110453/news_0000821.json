He also founded The SafePoint Trust, a charity that promotes the safe medical use of syringes around the world. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex. My first proper job was making models of murder scenes to help explain them to juries. It was brilliant because it gave me confidence that I could combine my hands and my brain to create something physical. Since childhood I’d known I wanted to solve a really big problem. In 1984 I found one. It was the early years of HIV/Aids and I read that reusing hypodermic syringes would soon become a major transmission route for the disease. That hit me in the face – that something so deadly could be passed on through something so preventable – and I became determined to invent a syringe that could never be reused. If you want to be an inventor you need to start with the problem, not the solution. It’s no good dreaming up a great invention if it’s too expensive to make or no one will buy it – I’ve seen too many patents for those. That’s why I started by spending three years researching: studying patents, touring factories and immunisation clinics, talking to health ministries, even visiting projects for drug users. My “eureka moment” was about simplicity. I realised that all the moulds used for manufacturing syringes were essentially similar, and that with a cheap and simple modification they could produce my design – where the plunger snaps off if you try to reuse the syringe. That’s vital because syringes are incredibly cheap and low-margin so manufacturers won’t invest a lot in new production lines. The benefits of not reusing syringes are immense. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that unsafe injection practices account for almost one in 100 deaths worldwide – not just from HIV but hepatitis, liver cancer and other diseases. It’s not only about saving lives. Every pound spent on single-use syringes saves a country £14.50 in extra medical costs, lost earnings etc. And if someone doesn’t have to spend an extra week in hospital because of an infection they picked up, they may earn enough extra to send their daughter to school that year. Our single-use, LifeSaver syringes have already helped to save an estimated 10 million lives. We’ve delivered five billion syringes so far. We account for almost a quarter of all syringes used in India and thanks to the support of WHO and UNICEF we’re the world’s biggest supplier for immunisation. There’s still a long way to go – currently our design accounts for about 5 per cent of all syringes sold – but that should increase dramatically when our patent expires in 2017. You need two things to succeed in “disruptive innovation”. One is good, scientific observation, the ability to see the objective truth and not believe your own hype. The second thing is persistence. You hit so many road blocks that you need an inner strength to keep going. But I’ve always felt that if I don’t do this it’s unlikely that anyone else will. So I keep going.
