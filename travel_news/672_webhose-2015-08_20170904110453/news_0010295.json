(AP) â€” An upstate New York museum known for its collection of work by Rembrandt, van Gogh and Picasso says it has received its largest donation of modern artwork in years.\nThe Hyde Collection in Glens Falls announced Friday that 55 works by some of the world's leading modern artists are a gift from Werner Feibes (FYE'-behs) and the late James Schmitt .\nThe donated artwork includes pieces by Ellsworth Kelly , Robert Motherwell , Bridget Riley and 43 other artists. It's the largest donation of modern artwork made to the museum since it received 82 works during a four-year period in the 1990s.\nFeibes and Schmitt were life and work partners who met in college and later worked at the same architectural firm in Schenectady. Schmitt died in 2013. Feibes donated the collection in both of their names.\n__\nThis story has been changed to correct the spelling of van Gogh.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T03:45:06.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
