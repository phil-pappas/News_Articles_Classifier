Carnival Vista is set to debut in Europe May 1, 2016.\nAllen and Gonzalez discuss the process – and the challenges – that go into creating the new floating brewery which will be housed within the Key West meets British West Indies-themed watering hole. One challenge was transporting delicate 4,000-pound glass brew kettles which were painstakingly loaded onto the 133,500-ton vessel at the Fincantieri shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. After the kettles and other machinery are loaded onto the vessel, the brewery must be constructed within the existing space on Promenade Deck 5, positioned around the L-shaped bar and distinctive décor. Gonzalez and Allen also travel to Stoneage Antiques along the Miami River to get a preview of some of the many colorful nautical artifacts that will be an important component of the pub’s interiors.\nCarnival Vista is scheduled to enter service from Europe May 1, 2016, then reposition to New York for a series of voyages in November 2016 followed by the launch of year-round Caribbean service from Miami later that month.\nSource:- Carnival Cruises", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:04:14.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
