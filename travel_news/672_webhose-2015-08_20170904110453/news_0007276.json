Both Jamie Oliver and Marco Pierre White have shipborne restaurants. \nBarrhead Travel chief executive Sharon Munro said: “We want potential holidaymakers to come along to find out more about the cruise packages we offer and get involved in all the fun.” \nThe news comes as the agency reports a 25% year-on-year increase in passengers booking river cruises since the start of the year. \nTop destinations for 2015 include the Rhine, the Danube, the Elbe and the Douro, and bookings for trips along the Yangtze in Asia and the Irrawaddy in Burma are on the up. \nIn addition, customers are booking more experiential trips like travelling via steamboat on the Mississippi, while couples are increasingly booking romantic cruises. \nMunro added: “People are looking for unforgettable, authentic, once-in-a-lifetime experiences and holidaymakers are now much more willing to travel further afield. \n“River cruising is a great way to get to the heart of these exotic locations. \n“With the increase in interest around rivers like the Yangtze and the Irrawaddy, we’re sure that this is a trend that will continue to grow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:08:13.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
