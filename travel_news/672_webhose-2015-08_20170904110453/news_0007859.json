While there is natural speculation about what other projects the engineers could be working on (after all, the job description does say “exciting new mobile products”, plural), it’s worth remembering just how pivotal Apple Music on Android could be to the continued success of Apple in the new cloud-based future of mobile.\nApple advertises for Android engineers (image: Apple.com)\nUnlike Microsoft’s current zeal for ensuring its apps are available on every mobile platform to drive consumers to use its cloud services, Apple rarely works on applications for other platforms.
