Or a charge to let you be the first to exit your plane?\nHow about a charge to put a radio frequency identification tag on your luggage so you can track its location in real time from your smartphone?\nThese were among the extras that at least 60% of travelers said they were willing to pay for, according to a survey of 2,339 business and leisure travelers by Flightview, a Boston-based flight information firm. An even higher rate of millennials, 75%, said they were willing to pay such fees.\nAmong other fees travelers would be willing to pay, according to the survey, are flight status alerts that are sent to family, employers, hotels and others; a smartphone app to let you pre-order food and drinks at airport eateries; in-seat charging stations for mobile devices; and a rental car service to pick you up at the terminal curb.\nâ€” Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/320315241/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-08-07T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T15:37:41.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
