Spirit Airlines' (NASDAQ: SAVE) team members, local families and patients gathered today at the Fort Lauderdale Airport in Broward County to join the fight to find a cure for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. This disease progressively paralyzes its victims, attacking nerve cells and pathways in the brain or spinal cord. ALS has no known cause or cure, but the Spirit Airlines team is rallying others in the community to change that. \"We are honored to help launch this event in South Florida. ALS is an amazing cause,\" said Ben Baldanza, President and CEO of Spirit Airlines, \"I challenge everyone to join the cause and take the challenge at your business or home!\" During the Ice Bucket Challenge Launch, ALS honored Spirit Airlines with its Corporate Hero Award for its support and compassion for the cause. Kim Hanna, President and CEO for The ALS Association Florida Chapter presented the award to Spirit's CEO Ben Baldanza. \"Spirit Airlines' support to ALS has been fundamental. Last year's generous donations from the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and the Walk to Defeat ALS helped the Florida Chapter to increase care services grants from $600 to $1,000 per patient a year,\" said Kim Hanna. \"We are proud to have them on our team.\" Baldanza, who lost his mother to ALS almost 30 years ago, is committed to raising awareness to both find a cure and for better patient care. He took the challenge along with the Spirit Airlines Team, the Airport Director Kent George and friends. People afflicted with ALS, their family members and caregivers gathered at Spirit's runway to watch the inaugural challenge. \"The Broward County Aviation Department is honored to be part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and the awareness it brings to the community. The airport works together as a team; and in this case, we can have a little fun while supporting a worthy cause,\" said Kent George, Director of Aviation. The dunk was followed by water cannon salute, the same way an inaugural flight is celebrated in the airline industry. A video of the event is available at https://vimeo.com/136656800 .
