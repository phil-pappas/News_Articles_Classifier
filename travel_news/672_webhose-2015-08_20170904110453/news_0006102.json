I remember waking up on Results Day; I checked the Ucas app on my phone and it said that I had been unsuccessful for both my universities. I think it was about 7am when I told my mum “I didn’t get in”. She thought I was joking. I went on the Ucas website, but it was so busy that it crashed. I stressed out. I went into my school, got my results, and then it hit me. I looked at my grades and I realised that I was only a couple of marks off getting into the universities. It really felt like my whole future was up in the air and I’d got one day to sort it out. I had a few options. I could have gone through a re-mark, but that meant that I had to wait. I rapidly ruled that out, purely because it was the year before the rise in tuition fees. Fees were still at £3,300, whereas they were climbing to £9,000 the following year. I would have loved to have taken a year out , but I simply couldn’t afford to. I didn’t want to pay £9,000 a year to do my studies. It was very stressful. I was applying for a Bsc in psychology. My first choice at the time was the University of Birmingham , and my second choice was the University of Leicester . I called up Leicester, but eventually they just said that they couldn’t take me because they were too busy. So that’s when I went into the Clearing process. I had heard about Clearing but I hadn’t thought that it was going to happen to me, so I didn’t consider it beforehand. Before Results Day, I was thinking about what accommodation I was going to book at university. In my head, choosing the course was the most important part of the Clearing process. I only wanted to study psychology. I think it's important to focus on the course rather than the university, because it’s what you’re passionate about that counts the most. So my next step was to make sure that if I was going to go to a university, the course had to be accredited by the British Psychological Society . It took about 50 phone calls to get through to Bournemouth University. They offered me a position, and so I went to visit their campus. However, I wasn’t too impressed by it, it seemed more like a college to me. After a few more phone calls, I got through to Nottingham who also offered me a position. But at the last minute they backed out, saying they had just given up their last place. I think it was about 200 phone calls later that I eventually talked to De Montfort University (DMU), in Leicester. Their offer was different because they took the time to explain why they would want me, what I would be able to do at their university, and so on. No other university had done that, and I found it really refreshing and reassuring. I knew the Leicester area but had never been to DMU. I believe that the way the staff spoke to me de-stressed me, probably because they were more optimistic. That’s why I chose DMU. It’s been brilliant studying there, and I got involved in many student societies. I loved the city of Leicester, it’s very diverse. Today I’m still at DMU, doing a Master’s in psychology and well-being. Paul Marvin, Josh's father, gives his perspective on Clearing Clearing has been around since I went to university so I was familiar with it. As soon as Josh just missed out on his insurance offer I encouraged him to get into the Clearing system. I was expecting him to get the results he needed for his second choice of Leicester so I hadn't expected him to need to go through Clearing. It wasn't necessarily stressful for me as he had to make all the phone calls, he just needed encouragement to stick with it and not accept the first thing on offer. Other than the lines being very busy the process was quite smooth. He was offered the place at DMU the same day and then took about a week I think to get paperwork and confirmation sorted. We talked through the offers and which one would be best to accept, but Josh handled it all himself. The only downside of going through Clearing is it makes it a bit last minute to secure your first year's accommodation. You have to be prepared to compromise a bit. As it turned out, the flat in university accommodation Josh got was OK and just happened to be next to Leicester City football ground. Very convenient for a football fan. But I'm sure Josh may have preferred a flat next to Anfield in Liverpool though... My advice is to persevere and get the process going as soon as possible. Don't get down about missing the grades. There's plenty of opportunities through Clearing and the end results can be very positive - much better than you think at the time. It's definitely not the end of the world even if you feel like it is. You have to put the effort in for a day or so. And you can still be picky - don't always go for the first choice on offer. Play the game and keep a few choices in hand before confirming. DMU actually turned out better for Josh than I think Leicester University would have done. He enjoyed being closer to the city centre and liked it enough to stay on and do his Master's there. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T12:43:47.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
