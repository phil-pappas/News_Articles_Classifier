On-site refuelling is routine, and the company isn't sure which tanks sparked the fire, he said.\n\nFirefighters spray water Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015, after a pair of propane tanks exploded on the ground outside of Vegas Balloon Rides on the Las Vegas strip Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015, leaving a 35-year-old man hospitalized with burns to his arm and leg. A spokesman for Vegas Balloon Rides said that a pilot was refueling balloon tanks when the blast occurred. Jeff Chatterton says on-site refueling is routine and the company isn't sure which tanks sparked the fire. (L.E. Baskow/Las Vegas Sun via AP) \nThe pilot is in good condition and \"good spirits,\" Chatterton said.\nThe cause of the fire is still being investigated, the Clark County Fire Department said. Two vans towing trailers and two larger propane tanks holding 500 to 1,000 gallons of fuel were venting fire that led smaller propane tanks to explode, Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Buchanan said. No other injuries were reported.\nWilliam Reynolds, 26, said he was on his couch on the 37th floor of a high-rise building nearby when he felt a tremble. He went out to the balcony to see \"an intense fire.\" As he started recording the thick black smoke filling the sky, he witnessed the second explosion.\n\"Flames were shooting out of the area in a very consistent stream,\" he said in an email.\nClark County Fire crews responded to the blasts shortly after 9 a.m. and had it under control before 11 a.m., preventing the fire from spreading to nearby structures, larger propane tanks and possible ammunition believed to be in a parked vehicle.\nThe company said its balloon rides launch off-site every day at dawn. Chatterton said he didn't know if the tanks being refuelled were used in that morning's flight.\nRiders typically don't visit its business south of the Rio casino-hotel, across Interstate 15 from the Las Vegas Strip.\nHe expects the company won't be offering rides for at least a couple of days, Chatterton said. He added that he wasn't sure if the empty baskets that hold passengers were also engulfed in the fire, but he assumed a few may have been destroyed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T04:28:17.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
