The way people interact is changing – we’ve seen rapid evolution in recent years and technology and generational behavior will continue to revolutionise business events.”\n“Having just stepped off the site tour, I can honestly say, this is a building that will be responding very effectively to those challenges. My appetite has been whet. I can’t wait to see it open next year.”\nWith just over 12 months until the much-anticipated ICC Sydney will be ready to open its doors to major international business events, BESydney CEO Lyn Lewis-Smith said the special preview provided the bureau’s guests with exclusive insights into what will be Australia’s premier meeting precinct.\n“Sydney is building for the future. Next year, the city will be home to new world-class convention and exhibition facilities. Already, we’ve secured more than 20 events for ICC Sydney and interest remains strong. Together with the multi-billion dollar program of reinvention and transformation across the city, including at Barangaroo and the Bays Precinct, Sydney will be where the world wants to meet.\nICC Sydney CEO Geoff Donaghy said he was delighted to show the distinguished group of key industry leaders and influencers how the venue was taking shape and how its integrated design would deliver a paradigm shift in the way that business events were delivered in the global city of Sydney.\n“ICC Sydney delivers increased convention and exhibition capability and flexibility fitting of an international city like Sydney, however it’s the integrated design that is an absolute game-changer for delivering business events on the world stage in this city.\n“Our ability to hold a number of consecutive events, including three concurrent large conventions, and an arrival of a contemporary 8,000-seat theatre that would double as an entertainment venue, adds to the dynamism and interactivity of the entire precinct. The way its design blends with the local environment further enhances its vitality by allowing visitors to experience Sydney like never before. Large glass facades, balconies and open air facilities provide fantastic views over the precinct, city skyline and harbour. It also allows Sydney to look back at ICC Sydney and be proud of the important events that will take place within,” Mr Donaghy said.\nThe tour of ICC Sydney capped off a memorable start to the week, which began with a tour of the city’s major renewal projects and city landmarks followed by a welcome lunch with Jonathan O’Dea, NSW Parliamentary Secretary for Major Events and Tourism.\nSource:-Sydney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:40:15.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
