Fat pigs, big sewage pipes, bamboo poles, carton boxes or the entire family including the grandmother and the dog.\n‘With the upcoming economy, owning a scooter is a symbol of freedom and wealth, like it is for people in many other countries to have a car.’\n‘Normal city cars are too expensive and not very handy in the narrow streets of the crowded city where parking a car is impossible.\n‘Your motorbike, however, can be parked anywhere on the site-walk.’\nThis rider appears to be in an uncomfortable position while transporting giant sacks filled with goods\nThese scenes play out on a daily basis in Vietnam, but they’re an eye-opener for Western tourists\nTon Koene’s photos show the riders carrying almost everything imaginable on the backs of their small motorbikes\nThe riders are often dwarfed by their cargo as they cruise through the streets of Hanoi and other cities\nIt's not just local delivery drivers who use motorbikes to get around; drivers for large companies such as Coca-Cola also use them\nWith so many motorbikes and scooters, pedestrian safety and the availability of parking spaces are issues, in addition to air pollution, especially in larger cities such as Hanoi.\nWhen tourists climb onto a motorbike it can be an overwhelming and dangerous experience.\nTon said: ‘Tourists love the motorbikes but are often inexperienced driving on unpaved road in rural areas or in extremely chaotic and congested traffic in the cities.\n‘Every day one can see youngsters from Europe, America and Australia walking in the streets with serious wounds and injuries as a result of scooter accidents.’\nHe added: ‘After a day walking in the city, one can get mad by the never ending loud engine and honking noise of the always surrounding scooters.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eCSHt1"], "published": "2015-07-30T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:18:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
