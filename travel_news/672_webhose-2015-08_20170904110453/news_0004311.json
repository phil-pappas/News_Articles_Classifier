But nothing has prepared them for this. For more than 90 days Tom Rainey, 24, and Lawrence Walters, 23, have suffered jellyfish stings, seen their fibreglass rowing boat encircled by sharks, and endured raging storms. But after rowing almost 4,000 miles across the North Atlantic, the two young adventurers from south west England are now within reach of the Devon coast. When they arrive, sometime on Tuesday, they will become the youngest people ever to make the journey under their own steam. Fuelling their crossing has been their close friendship and their determination to pay tribute to Mr Rainey’s father Luke, who died suddenly of a brain tumour at the age of 57. Along the way they have grappled with the 40-knot winds and 80ft high waves of an Atlantic hurricane and been thrown around their tiny cabin like rag dolls when their boat capsized twice. That was not the worst of it however. That came on a day when the sun was shining and a gentle breeze was blowing. Suddenly the barometer dropped and the sky got dark. The wind swung round 90 degrees, picking up speed so suddenly it was too late to launch the sea anchor — an underwater parachute that slows and steadies the craft. Instead, Mr Rainey and Mr Walters had no option but to row through the night, into the eye of the storm, and out the other side. Understandably they are now looking forward to setting foot on dry land once again and enjoying a “big boozy Sunday lunch” with their families. Speaking via satellite phone to the Telegraph after 13 weeks at sea, Mr Rainey says the exhaustion and pain is getting to them and the hardest thing is not knowing when they’ll be home. “We’re at the complete mercy of the weather,” he added. Mr Rainey, who was born in Kent and grew up in Devon, hit on the idea of rowing across the Atlantic while working off the coast of Angola as an oceanographer positioning oil rigs, in the months that followed his father’s death shortly before Christmas 2012. The plan was to row from New York to Salcombe, in south Devon, to pay tribute to a man who meant so much to him and who was passionate about the ocean by raising money for the Brain Tumour Trust, the charity which had helped Mr Rainey Snr, a film colourist, towards the end of his life. Sailing had been Tom Rainey’s passion from childhood and he competed for the British youth sailing team in the Laser class, also studying oceanography at Plymouth University. After a friend pulled out of the project following a back injury, just three weeks before they were due to launch Yves, their specially designed, 24-feet-long boat, from Manhattan, Mr Rainey recruited his friend Lawrence (Loz) Walters who had also competed for Britain in the Laser class. First month at sea on tracker Mr Walters said: “Tom was in turmoil. He was already in New York and didn’t even know if the row was going ahead. He was talking about going alone. He’d already asked if I could be on standby but I’d just started a new engineering job six months before. I’d had my probation review in March and now I was asking my manager for unpaid leave to row across the Atlantic. A week later it was approved.” For the entirety of the journey, Mr Rainey and Mr Walters, who was born in Lymington, Dorset, and specialised in boat design engineering at University of Southampton, would update their shore-based crew via a satellite phone for posting on their blog. The first message came five hours after launch on Sunday, May 3rd. They were “sore and tired as to be expected” but the sun was out and Paul Simon was blaring from the speakers. By the next day they had begun to adapt to a never-ending pattern: one man rowing, the other snatching 90-minutes’ sleep, swap, repeat. The sleep deprivation has been brutal. They have pushed their bodies to the limits; seen patches of skin peel off and wounds stubbornly refuse to heal. Mr Rainey developed a fungal infection weeks ago on his groin and buttocks which meant simply sitting in his seat causes excruciating pain. With all the anti-fungal cream gone, the only way to treat it has been to keep it dry — an impossible feat in a rowing boat in the middle of the ocean. For the first month they saw half a dozen sharks each day; other times so many jellyfish beneath them they couldn’t see the water. They’ve spotted metre-wide turtles, 12-feet stingrays; whales; hundreds of dolphin. 15 amazing adventures for 2015 Servicemen defy disability to row across the Atlantic In the early weeks of the trip it was hard to watch as the satellite tracking their progress showed Yves making giant loops around what’s known as the Kelvin Seamount — an underwater mountain range which can cause fierce eddies on the surface as the Gulf Stream swirls around the 'peaks’ underneath. In order for them to break free of the eddy they were forced to row back towards New York. “Once we broke out of it I could feel the whole boat change,” Mr Rainey said. “But three hours later I felt it suck us back in.” Instead of fighting it, the pair launched the sea anchor and just watched their boat go around in circles. “We didn’t do any rowing that night. We just ate and drank whiskey,” he said. Lawrence, left, and Tom training in Salcombe (Ocean Valour) Three days later they emerged from the eddy eastwards into the Gulf Stream. Incredibly, after such a setback, between May 30th and 31st they covered 112.52 nautical miles, setting a new Guinness world record for the fastest distance covered in an ocean rowing boat in a 24-hour period. “Hardest week of my life,” Mr Rainey said in his audio blog posted on his website, adding: “Finding it hard to keep morale and hope up.” The thought of seeing his girlfriend, Abbie Gill, is keeping him going – that and a “big boozy Sunday lunch with his family … because at the moment my body is just eating itself.” As for the storms they faced, neither Mr Walters nor Mr Rainey appear to be terribly fazed. “It’s just a case of hunkering down in the cabin” Mr Walters said. But 'hunkering down’ is actually the key to survival in Yves: the door is water tight, and the boat can only right itself if it’s shut. If water gets in, Yves will sink. At one point during the hurricane Mr Rainey went out on deck to strap the life raft down. “I looked upwind for the first time and it was pretty terrifying — just a mountain of waves and black sky.” On another occasion, Rainey’s shore team received a distress signal from Yves’s emergency beacon. It seemed to have either been switched off manually or broken and so the team’s operations director Alex Janzen, a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Marines, decided to wait. If he raised the alarm, a search and rescue operation would spell the end of the record attempt. Walters and Rainey were due to call in again in 15 minutes – the most painful Rainey’s mother Anne and Walters’s mother Vanessa had ever spent. But they dialled in on time – Rainey had apparently knocked the emergency beacon from its cradle with his feet and hadn’t realised. Ocean Valour training in the Hudson river, New York Mr Rainey’s sister, Sasha Perry, says when he told his family he was going to row across the Atlantic they knew they were never going to stop him. “When Luke died Tom didn’t break down and cry like the rest of us, so for him this was part of his grieving process, whether we liked it or not. All we could do was support him. Never for a moment did we try to talk him out of it.” Anne Rainey said: “When they left New York we were incredibly proud.” Mr Rainey, who wants to join the Marines, turned 24 on June 30th. Walters made him a birthday cake from chocolate flavoured protein powder he’d formed into a wedge with a little water. For a gift he gave him the last two squirts of deodorant and the last drop of shampoo. Mr Walters says he’ll miss the nights where there’s been a gentle breeze and a clear sky. “You can see the whole Milky Way, shooting stars, satellites.” The Atlantic crossing has helped Mr Rainey deal with the loss of his father. He said: “It was really hard at the beginning. I’d ball my eyes out at night. I have loads of regrets I didn’t spend enough time with him when he was alive. But I love the fact I’m doing this for him. I’m making everyone remember him which is enough for me really. It makes me really happy.” Mr Walters added: “I’m uncertain what happens next, but I really hope this gives Tom closure. He absolutely deserves it. We’ve both said that at night it feels like there are more than just two of us on Yves. We’re sure there’s an essence of Luke watching over us.” Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T02:34:30.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
