Johnny Ward is making a nice income while travelling. Source: Supplied \nJOHNNY Ward didn’t grow up rich. In fact, he describes his financial situation as a youngster as “super poor”. \nBut the 31-year-old didn’t let that stop him from achieving his dream of travelling the world. Determined not to get trapped in “the real world” of working full time and rarely having a holiday, he set off on a globetrotting adventure once finishing university. \nBut his bank account kept drying up and he needed to boost his finances, so by 2012 he had started his own company. \nSince that day he has earnt $1.5 million and now works just a few hours a week, from his laptop, anywhere in the world. All while exploring 152 countries — so far. \nNow that’s the life. \nThe inspiring traveller tells news.com.au how he does it. \n• When did you start travelling and how do you finance it? \n“I grew up in Northern Ireland with my mum and sister in a small, quiet town called Kilkeel. We didn’t have much money at all and coming from a small place, I guess that’s what started the burning desire to escape, see the world and create a life without so many financial restrictions. \n“I graduated from university in England in 2006, where I studied International Economics. I did a few summer camps with disadvantaged kids and special needs kids in the US during my university holidays, then I moved to Thailand with a one-way ticket to teach English, after graduating. Teaching in Thailand. Source: Supplied \n“I knew there was more to life than a 40+ hour week. \n“I wanted to travel but I couldn’t afford it, so the next best thing was to live and work in an exotic location so Chiang Mai, Thailand became my home for a year. From that point, there was no going back to the real world I think. \n“My new life was exciting everyday, meeting amazing people, having adventures all the time, from then there was no way I could get a ‘real job’.” This is the life. Source: Facebook \n• Are you still travelling? If so, where are you now? \n“Always. I’m in South Africa collecting visas for Central Africa, just got my visa for Chad and Central African Republic. I’m off to Namibia tomorrow.” With hyenas in Ethiopia. Source: Supplied \n• How do you generate the income you do, while on the road? \n“In 2010 I started a blog called onestep4ward.com , after 12 months of lost hours spent working in an office in Australia while I saved up enough to keep travelling. Then I created a digital media company in 2012 which does corporate blogging for companies, manages their social media, deals with their SEO etc. \n“I always prioritised my lifestyle though, so I’ve never worked full time in that sense of the word. \n“When building it, I probably worked 20 hours a week, now its more like 10-15. I have limited technical abilities though, and outsource everything, managing my staff from my laptop. Not a bad place to work! Source: Facebook \n“My income since 2012 has ranged from $13,000 to $81,000 per month, averaging out at over $1400 per day. \n“I’ve also got property investments that have been working well and recently earned me an extra $100,000+. Ultimately, I’ve earnt about $1.5 million since that day.” On Mt Kinabalu, Malaysia. Source: Supplied \n• What are some of the highs and lows of your travels? \n“The visa stresses are a low — some countries are so tough to enter. I’m not travelling aimlessly, I’m trying to visit every country in the world so I can’t skip them — no matter how difficult or dangerous they are, that can be tricky! \n“Also, not having a regular pay check is stressful too. The highs are undoubtedly associated with the freedom, no one telling me what to do, no requesting holiday time, just the open road.” \n• How many places have you visited and is your passion still as strong for travel? \n“I haven’t visited them all yet. but I’m getting there — currently on 152 out of 193. I should finish next year, hopefully around late summer. I still have that burning desire to see everywhere, different cultures, religions, cuisines, landscapes — it’s amazing. \n“Also, I think I’m going cycle from New York City to San Francisco when I finish, that’d be pretty cool.” His love for travel is still strong. Source: Supplied \n• Have you been to Australia and what did you think of it? \n“I used to live there! When I ran out of money in ‘09 I moved to Sydney for a year and worked for a conference company in the sales department, met some friends for life there and the company were really good to me. \n“I loved my time in Australia, it was one of the best years of my life, despite the office job. Alice Springs/Uluru was so gorgeous, Cairns with the Barrier Reef, drinking too many beers and going to the MCG to watch the AFL — so many brilliant memories.” Living it up in Australia. Source: Supplied \n• Do you have any advice for people longing to follow in your footsteps? \n“For me three things changed my life — moving to Asia to teach English, that took me out of the rat race early on. Also, starting a blog and working out how online marketing, SEO, writing, and building an audience worked. And then creating my media company. In Kuwait. Source: Facebook \n“The first two, anyone can do right now, the third one is possible too, but learn the ropes with the blog first. I’m planning to design a course next year showing people how to do all three, I hope that will help people to follow their dreams as I followed mine.” Yeah, his life must be hard ...
