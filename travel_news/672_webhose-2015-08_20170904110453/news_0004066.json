You have agreed to dedicate your time and attention to someone for a couple of hours. Why not relish some well-earned time off spent abroad? Is Facebook that important that you cannot leave your phone unattended for 120 minutes? Using your phone during dinner is even worse when you are eating with only one other person; it destroys the mood by creating a barrier and is a breaker in the conversation, causing the other party to wonder why they are not worth your undivided attention. Furthermore, the obsession with food photography is most off-putting. You have been presented with a good-looking dish; is there honestly a need to take a picture (with your flash on) and head straight to Instagram in order to share it with your friends? I don’t think so. If my grandfather was alive to witness the lack of etiquette at dinner these days, offenders would be back on the “kids table” before they could say “I must tweet about the menu”. Please, do everyone a favour, quit double-tapping and writing witty captions, just enjoy the moment and be present.

(@girleatworld) on May 22, 2015 at 8:06pm PDT Strangers in the night I was holidaying last summer in the south of Spain at a lovely seaside hotel. One evening at dinner, I spent some time observing the strange behaviour of the couple sat across from my table. Oblivious to his dinner, the man was texting away on his phone while his partner took photos of her food from every possible angle. Neither ate more than a few bites and both plates returned to the kitchen barely touched. Insanity! Phones and the dinner table should not mix. Chris Young Smiley face! Keep a firm grip on your mobile phone and keep it under the table, at least until the first course arrives. By then, it’s perfectly acceptable to photograph the food, ask the waiter to take your photo, pull out a selfie stick and take an image of you with a blurred plate of whatever to post on Instagram. We’re all eager to know what you’re eating and how it tastes… cold. Remember your friends too, so keep Snapchatting. What about all your followers on Periscope? You’ve a live video to produce. See all those hearts and smiley faces, they love you, love you, love you. Your dining companions can wait. They already know what’s been happening in your life and all the super-cool stuff you do. You are, after all, connected, and by bonds stronger than your ancestors ever had. You have a phone. Meraid Griffin It’s research time No there should not be a ban on mobile phones in hotel dining rooms. We travel spontaneously and often use meal times in hotels (breakfast especially) to research and book the next leg of our journey. Of course we’re not there yapping away loudly on our phones but quietly tapping at a screen utilising the (hopefully) free Wi-Fi. Emma Heap Hoteliers can say no Owners of guesthouses and hotels should decide, as we have, to have a policy of asking clients not to take these items into public parts of their establishments. If clients don’t like the policy they can choose not to patronise the establishment. John England, Crubenbeg House, Scotland Two dining rooms? While there would be lots of pros in restricting phone use, in today’s world, people are addicted to their mobiles (and selfies) and any hotels that imposed an outright ban could find themselves losing guests. Maybe hotels could provide two dining rooms – one in which phones are permitted; the other digital free? H Edun Wider seats needed Further to your news item (“ Should heavy fliers pay more ?”, August 1), I too once had to sit next to an obese person on a four-hour flight. Because she encroached into my seating area, I was forced to lean towards my daughter’s seat. My back hurt for weeks after that flight. I will never again sit next to someone like that and will demand they move, I move or that one of us gets on a different flight. If they can’t fit into the seat properly – buy another one. Economy seats on most planes are too small even for average-size passengers. Airlines should create rows that instead of containing three seats would be converted to having just two (wider) ones. They should then charge people who need to sit in them 1.5 times the normal seat price. Anyone who could not fit through a girth-set door frame at the gate would be required to purchase one of these wider ones. Comments posted online Airlines are already trying to tackle the increasing problem of passenger obesity, which is becoming a major issue especially in the United States.

The following towns all boast beautiful natural settings; historic buildings and architecture; and between them, a plethora of art galleries, antiques emporia and independent shops, along with great places to eat or sit and watch the more actively inclined rush by: ● Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire: a multi-hued Georgian delight. Work off lunch in the Cawdor Arms with a stroll around the grounds of nearby Dinefwr House (NT), affording spectacular views over the Towy Valley. ● Crickhowell, Powys: wander through picturesque cobbled streets and then enjoy a picnic on the banks of the River Usk under the gaze of the Black Mountains. ● Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan: browse the honey-stoned shops of this prosperous medieval walled town. ● Monmouth, Monmouthshire: have a coffee in Agincourt Square and see the statues of the town’s most famous sons, Henry V and Charles Rolls. ● Narberth, Pembrokeshire: a major “foodie” destination. Ultracomida delicatessen is a must-sample. ● St Asaph, Denbighshire: even the laziest pilgrim will not tire looking around the UK’s smallest cathedral. ● Chirk, Wrexham: after exploring its castle, take a leisurely ride along the Telford-built aqueduct spanning the Ceiriog valley, in this border town.
