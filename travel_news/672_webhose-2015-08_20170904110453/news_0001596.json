The series and indeed the extra features on these DVD and Blu-ray collections have Scotland at their heart, and I’m sure even more viewers will be inspired to become visitors as a result.”\nBased on the bestselling novels by Diana Gabaldon, Outlander follows the story of Claire Randall (played by Caitriona Balfe), a married English combat nurse from 1945 who, while on her second honeymoon in Inverness, is mysteriously swept back in time to the 18th-century Scottish Highlands. There she meets Jamie (played by Scottish actor Sam Heughan), a chivalrous young warrior, with whom she becomes romantically entwined.\nSource:-Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:11:45.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
