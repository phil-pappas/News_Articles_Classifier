Foreigners accounted for 19% of the more than 40 million people who visited the gambling destination last year, according to the agency's visitor surveys. The number has risen 3 percentage points in three years ago. \nRossi Ralenkotter, the authority's president and CEO, has said it's a goal to increase international travel, including a possible program directed specifically at boosting Chinese travel. There are no direct flights to Las Vegas from China as well as Japan. \nAsked by Kim Sinatra with Wynn Resorts Ltd. why airports such as Boston's Logan International Airport could land direct flights to Asia and Las Vegas couldn't, Vassiliadis said Boston offered financial incentives for the flights. \n\"It will be interesting to see if the flights stay when the subsidy goes away,\" she said, adding it's a \"very, very risky business to get into.\" \nDesign and construction on the extra gates is expected to cost $51 million and the project is expected to be finished by late 2016 or early 2017.
