They wish to benchmark best practice and identify trends and this report is the first to pull it all together. Uniquely, it covers the whole topic of autonomous vehicles on-road, off-road, on water, underwater and in the air, whether carrying passengers or not. Indeed, those that are only occasionally autonomous during use and those that are only weakly autonomous are identified and discussed, not least because most of them are headed to be fully autonomous in due course. Autonomous cars are dealt with soberly in the context of greater successes.\nOnly this report is up to date and global in reach, being based on interviews, events and data analysis almost entirely in 2015 and 2014. It is not an academic treatise nor is it simply a consolidation of what is on the web. A high proportion of the tables and figures are original. There are slides from recent conferences across the world. It is analysis, so the negatives are also presented.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n2. INTRODUCTION\n3.
