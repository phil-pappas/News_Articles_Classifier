But by the end of the fiscal year, it was reduced to about $250,000 through fundraising, higher-than-expected ticket sales and recent cost-cutting measures.\n“It will take us a couple of years to right the ship,” said Herrmann. “But given our endowment, our budgeting and a line of credit we have, I’m confident we can do it.” He noted that the theater’s main priorities now are maintaining its high standard of artistic production, and beefing up fundraising and marketing efforts.\nHerrmann declined to speculate on the causes for the deficit, except to note that at least one expensive, long-term project has paid off over the long run, in last season’s box office and critical success of the LBJ bio-dramas, “ All the Way ” and “ The Great Society .”\nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:33:17.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
