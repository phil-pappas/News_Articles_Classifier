During the summer months the travel pattern amongst frequent travelers changes toward more leisure oriented destinations. In response to this, SAS opened 47 seasonal routes. Demand responded particularly well to/from Denmark and Sweden and grew by 3.5% combined with higher load factors. SAS total scheduled number of passengers also grew by 0.8%.\nScheduled capacity was decreased 0.5% but traffic during July was unchanged, which resulted in a 0.4 p.u. higher load factor of 86.9%. SAS intercontinental capacity was increased by 0.6% but the traffic was down 0.9%. While SAS decreased its capacity on European/ Intrascandinavian routes by 1.7%, traffic increased 0.3% in response to the seasonal route adjustments particularly on European routes. Domestic traffic was up 1% and capacity was up 3.1% primarily reflecting increased capacity on Swedish domestic routes.\nSource:- SAS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:44:26.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
