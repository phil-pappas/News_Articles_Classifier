(NASDAQ: HAS) will debut its second season on September 12 . This season, host Billy Gardell (\"Mike & Molly\") and local game co-host Todd Newton (\"Family Game Night\") return to Las Vegas to help make more and more millionaires. The \"MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB\" TV game show is filmed on a new, custom-built soundstage that is the largest in Nevada and atop the largest LED floor ever used on a TV series. The stage is located adjacent to Bally's Las Vegas on the Strip. Gardell and Newton will greet contestants and take them through a series of games inspired by the iconic MONOPOLY game for their chance to win a million dollars.\n\"We're headed back to Vegas with hundreds of lucky contestants ready for their shot at winning life-changing money,\" said Gardell. \"We made two millionaires last season, and I want to see if we can break that record this time around.\"\nIn its first season, the \"MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB\" TV game show awarded record-setting amounts of money. During its 12-episode premiere run, \"MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB\" gave away more than $5 million in cash and prizes to contestants and audience members, and awarded two $1 million grand prizes to individuals from the Georgia Lottery and Rhode Island Lottery, which sets a record for the most cash any television game show in history has given away in its first season.\n\"The enthusiasm that our stations and audience showed for the first season of 'MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB' was overwhelming,\" said Steve Saferin , President of Properties Group and Chief Creative Officer for Scientific Games. \"We are building on that success to bring more energy, more fun and massive cash prizes to the second season of this groundbreaking show.\"\nThis season the show will move to a half-hour format. Every show, three contestants will play one of eight signature games for the chance to win up to $100K . Then, one contestant will risk their winnings to advance to \"GO! For A Million,\" the exciting final round that offers the chance to win $1 million in cash and other prizes.\nThe one-of-a-kind game show can be seen on stations owned by Tribune, Sinclair, Hearst, CBS, Gannett, Media General, Graham Holdings , and other leading station groups covering more than 90 percent of U.S. TV households.

The series was created by Scientific Games under license from Hasbro and is based on the MONOPOLY brand, which is one of the most well-known brands in the world. Lottery tickets are available at retailers in participating states.\nThe \"MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB\" studio audience consists of hundreds of lottery players, and their guests, who were awarded a five-day, four-night trip for two to Las Vegas , with a stay at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino , and a seat in the audience to watch the taping of the show. Contestants are randomly selected from the live studio audience to compete in an array of MONOPOLY themed games to win cash and prizes valued at $2.3 million per episode. On \"MONOPOLY MILLIONAIRES' CLUB\", the studio audience is deeply invested in the outcome as each contestant splits his or her cash winnings with one section of the studio audience in each of the signature games. In the final round, if the contestant passes GO, he or she will collect $200K to split with his or her audience section. If the contestant lands on GO, he or she wins $1 million and his or her audience section will split a cash prize worth up to another $1 million .\nFor logos and artwork, please click here .\nThe MONOPOLY name and logo, the distinctive design of the game board, the four corner squares, the MR.
