Photograph by: Terry Kole , The Associated Press \nForget crowded Cape Cod and that other island, Martha’s Vineyard , frequented every summer by America’s tourist-in-chief, President Barack Obama. If you’re looking for unspoiled ocean vistas and beaches with breathing room, hop a ferry to Nantucket , wander the cobblestone streets and drink in the views and microbrews. \nNantucket tends to get overlooked in the shadow of the Vineyard, Obama’s go-to destination for a couple of weeks most Augusts. Here on Nantucket, there are no road closures or impromptu swarms of Secret Service agents – just a little more space and a lot more charm. \nNantucket means “faraway land” in the language of its native tribe, the Wampanoags, but it’s just 50 kilometres offshore – an hour’s journey via high-speed ferry from Cape Cod. \nWhaling lifted Nantucket to economic superpower status two centuries ago, and no visit is complete without a stop at the downtown Nantucket Whaling Museum . Storytellers will regale you with the tale of the Essex, the whaling ship that sank in the Pacific in 1820 and inspired Herman Melville’s Moby Dick . \nLike any island, Nantucket can be pricey, so brace yourself for sticker shock. Stylish inns such as the historic Jared Coffin House will cater to all your creature comforts for upwards of $300 a night, but more affordable bed and breakfast alternatives abound. \nAlso, cobblestones are murder on the feet, so wear comfortable shoes, not heels. And bring a windbreaker. Even when it’s sweltering on the mainland, the unrelenting sea breeze can make you wish you had one while dining outside at dusk. \nIce cream and beer make a hideous combination, but you won’t want to leave the island without separately sampling the best of both. \nOn Nantucket, that means lining up outside The Juice Bar on Broad Street. Don’t let the name throw you: if the queue of salivating tourists and locals doesn’t clue you in, the wafting aroma of homemade waffle cones will. \nThirsty? Take the free shuttle to Nantucket’s Cisco Brewery and sample their latest beers. Cisco is best-known for its Whale’s Tale Pale Ale, but you never know what kind of stunning seasonal brews you’ll find on tap. Wine lovers can sip the latest vintages from the sister", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:53:44.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
