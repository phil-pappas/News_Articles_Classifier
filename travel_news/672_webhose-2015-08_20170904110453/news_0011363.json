The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers will be performing those shows at the Royal Court Theater aboard Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 ocean liner .\n“I’ve never done this before. I’ve never been on a ship the size of the Queen Mary,” Mr. Nash said by phone. “I’m looking forward to this immensely.”\nMr. Nash said the trio will be “rehearsing some new tunes” and enjoying their staterooms during the trans-Atlantic crossing that starts Sept. 4 in New York and arrives seven days later in Southampton, England, but they won’t be out of sight while not performing. The group will be interacting with Cunard guests during Q. and A. and autograph sessions.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
