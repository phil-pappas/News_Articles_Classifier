(And we all know she loves to eat.) Here are some of Oprah's favorite Chicago restaurants, \"favorite\" being defined as a restaurant Oprah has given a \"shout out\" to either on her show or in the press. Table Fifty-Two Saying Table Fifty-Two is an Oprah fave is a no-brainer -- chef and co-owner Art Smith was previously Oprah's personal chef, so obviously she's a big fan of his cooking. That cachet, along with Smith's deft handling of Southern cuisine and the mere 60-odd seats, means you'll have to scratch and claw for a reservation here. Cuisine: American Southern Address: 52 W. Elm St., Chicago Phone: 312-573-4000 Hours: Tuesday - Saturday, lunch 11:30 a.m. - 2:00 p.m., dinner 5:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.; Sunday, brunch 10:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m., dinner 4:00 - 8:30 p.m.; closed Mondays RL In an interview with the local NBC affiliate, Oprah said that Ralph Lauren's venture into the dining business \"is one of my favorite restaurants. It looks just like Ralph Lauren's house inside â€” it's gorgeous. You know, I don't get out much, but I've even braved cold Chicago winter nights to get there.\" Of course most of us proletariats have not been inside Ralph Lauren's house, so we'll just have to take her word for it.
