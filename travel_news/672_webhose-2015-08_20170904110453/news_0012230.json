It now gets around 2.5million hits a month from all over the world. Her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella, was the fastest selling debut recipe collection of all time. She studied history of art at the University of St Andrews . I wanted to get out of my comfort zone at university . I’d been living in London and was a real homebody – so I chose somewhere that’s right at the other end of the UK. None of my friends from school were going there either, which was a good thing. If I’d gone with loads of people I knew I’d just have stuck with them and not explored. Freshers’ Week was scary to start with . I remember getting to my room and not knowing what to do with myself. I just went around knocking on doors. It’s intimidating, suddenly being in this new town all by yourself. But the nice thing about St Andrews is that it’s a small place. If you meet someone once, you know you’ll bump into them again. I really liked that. I love exercise , but I didn’t join a single sports club as a student – I have no hand-eye co-ordination. Things like yoga are amazing, but anything with a ball just isn’t for me. I lived off cereal, peanut butter from the jar and pick ’n’ mix for the first two years. I was the sort of person who’d have happily eaten pasta at every meal, and I was living in catered halls, which didn’t make it easy to eat healthily. Sharing a kitchen is tough, too – there’s never enough space, and everyone leaves it in such a state. Just after I finished my second year, I became really ill [with postural tachycardia syndrome, a very rare condition that affects the nervous system]. It was a real struggle to keep up with all my work. But the university was so understanding – even though my grades weren’t great and deadlines were tough. I started Deliciously Ella at the end of my third year . I was fed up of being on so much medication that wasn’t working, and I’d read about people with chronic conditions who’d had some success after changing their diet and lifestyle. So I thought I’d give it a go. The problem was, I couldn’t cook . So I decided to start a blog as a way of forcing myself to try new recipes. And after three years of solid study, I was definitely ready for something a bit different. One of the first things I did was teach myself to use a camera so I could take proper shots of the food I was making for the blog. I loved having that chance to learn a new skill, and I still do all my own photos. Starting a blog while you’re a student could change your life . You don’t have the pressure to find a full-time job and support yourself like you will when you leave, which gives you time to properly experiment. For me, it was such an amazing experience. I was able to really get to grips with social media and find out what my audience liked and didn’t like. By the time I graduated, I had enough of a head start that I was able to make a career out of it. The first recipe I made was a disaster . I’d been chopping and pressing dates to create a raw brownie, and I thought it would work even better if I blended them in a food processor. So I went and bought one specially. When my boyfriend at the time came over to try the results, he took one bite and spat it out – I’d left the plastic on the blades. Things improved! \"I lived off cereal, peanut butter from the jar and pick ’n’ mix for the first two years. I was the sort of person who’d have happily eaten pasta at every meal.\" I didn’t know if I wanted anyone to read the blog to begin with . It felt so personal. But eventually I started sharing it with people. In my first six months I only had about 100,000 hits, but in the second six months I had 900,000. I thought to myself, “Interesting – there’s obviously something here”. Students are so much more interested in eating well now . I get people who’ve just got to university writing to me saying, “I want to start being a bit healthier but I don’t really know where to begin”. If you only buy one kitchen gadget at uni, make it a NutriBullet .They’re relatively small and inexpensive, and they make it so incredibly easy to get all of your portions of fruit and vegetables every day. You can make a really nourishing breakfast smoothie with bananas, berries and oats that will give you a proper boost for the rest of the day, or simply whizz up some avocado, cucumber and celery for a hangover-curing green juice. You can even make hummus in them, which is so much cheaper and nicer than the shop-bought stuff, I think. If I could go back in time to Freshers’ Week I’d tell myself to make the most of university. Enjoy the fact you have all this time to do things you love. People always say that to you when you’re about to start, but you never listen, do you?
