Over a thousand Colombians “who did not have any type of identification” had been deported since Friday, according to the governor of the Venezuelan state of Táchira, José Gregorio Vielma. Luis Acosta/AFP \nCÚCUTA, Colombia — Hundreds of Colombians fled Venezuela Tuesday, opting to leave the country with their belongings rather than be deported empty-handed like more than 1,000 people sent home in an escalating border crisis. \nSome carted refrigerators or mattresses on their backs as they made the trek from the Venezuelan state of Táchira back to their home country, wading through the waist-deep water of the river that forms the border. \n“We left at 3:00 am in the clothes we were wearing. We wanted to come back before they deported us,” said Rosana Morena, a 25-year-old Colombian who left with her two children. \nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro ordered the border between Táchira and the Colombian department of Norte de Santander closed last week in response to an attack by unidentified assailants on a military patrol, which wounded a civilian and three soldiers on an anti-smuggling operation. \nColombians deported from Venezuela who returned for some of their belongings and crossed them through the bordering Tachira river, stand on the banks of the river in Cúcuta, on the Colombian side, on Aug. 25, 2015. Luis Acosta/AFP \nHe initially ordered the closure for 72 hours, but later extended it indefinitely, accusing the neighboring country of waging “an attack on Venezuela’s economy.” \nThat was a reference to the rampant smuggling of heavily subsidized food and other goods out of Venezuela. \nVenezuela has long used its oil wealth to fund price controls that keep goods like rice and toilet paper up to 10 times cheaper than in Colombia. \nBut it is also in the grips of crippling shortages, now exacerbated by tumbling oil prices. \nAfter closing the border, the Venezuelan government launched mass deportations, unleashing what Colombian Interior Minister Juan Fernando Cristo decried as “a humanitarian tragedy.” \nMost of the deportees were sent home for alleged documentation problems, without families or their belongings. \nSome 600 of them are being housed in shelters, while 400 are staying with relatives, officials said. \nColombian police said another 400 to 700 people had streamed across the border to avoid deportation. \nA Colombian who was deported from Venezuela waits in front of his now former house, marked with a “D” for demolition, in San Antonio de Tachira, Venezuela, where he returned for his belongings to carry them across the bordering Tachira River, on Aug. 25, 2015. Luis Acosta/AFP \nDozens of those fleeing accused Venezuelan soldiers of robbing their belongings and ordering them to leave their homes within a matter of hours — marking houses with a D for “deported” or an R for “relocated.” \nAuthorities in the Colombian border town of Cúcuta have set up a center to deal with the influx. \nThe two nations’ foreign ministers are scheduled to meet Wednesday in the Colombian resort city of Cartagena to discuss the crisis. \nColombian police help Colombian citizens carry their belongings as they cross the Táchira border river from Brisas de Barinitas, Táchira state, Venezuela to Colombia on Aug. 25, 2015. Colombia complained Monday that Venezuela’s mass deportation of its citizens during a crackdown on smuggling has created a “humanitarian tragedy” on part of their border.
