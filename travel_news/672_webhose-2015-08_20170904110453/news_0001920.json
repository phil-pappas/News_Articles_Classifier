A 25-year-old security video is raising new questions in the mystery of who pulled off the biggest art heist in American history.\nOn Thursday (Aug. 6), the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a fuzzy clip of a hatchback pulling up to a side door at the Isabella Steward Gardner Museum in Boston. In the video, a man gets out of the car and is let in a museum side door by the security guard on duty, Richard Abath.\nThe sequence is intriguing because of what happened almost exactly 24 hours later: Abath again buzzed in people who shouldn’t have been there, this time two men dressed as police officers. The fake officers bound Abath and another guard with duct tape and made off with 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts and a Vermeer. The lost works are valued at $500 million.

Trace takes a look at the science of drawing faces, and why we draw humans that look like Neanderthals. “It was the single largest property crime in U.S. history,” said Robert Whittman, a retired special agent who founded the FBI’s national Art Crime Team in 2005. Whittman, author of “Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World’s Stolen Treasures” (Broadway Books, 2011), worked undercover on the Gardner case between 2006 and 2008.\nTwisted mystery\nThe Gardner heist went off in the early morning hours of March 18, 1990. Since then, there have been tantalizing clues as to the art’s whereabouts, including a ransom note sent to the museum in 1994, an alleged viewing of one of the stolen paintings by a Boston Herald reporter in 1997, and an offer made to an undercover Whittman to sell a Rembrandt and a Vermeer in 2006. Authorities investigating other art thefts blew Whittman’s cover before he could secure the deal. [ 9 Famous Art Forgeries ]\nAbath has always denied any involvement in the art heist . The newly revealed video is a significant step in the investigation because it seems to contradict Abath’s denials of wrongdoing, said Stephen Kurkjian, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist who was the principal reporter on the Gardner case for The Boston Globe.\n“The car that was used the night of the theft is described as a hatchback, and the car that pulls up as seen in the new video appears to be a hatchback,” said Kurkjian, who recently released a book about the case, “Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World’s Greatest Art Heist” (PublicAffairs, 2015). “So that’s very troubling that he would have allowed someone who was unapproved to be inside the museum during that night watch. That’s a breach of protocol, so now we know he breached protocol twice, the night of the theft and the same time the previous night.”\nThe new release also raises questions about whether the FBI had previously tracked down the lead presented in the tape, Kurkjian told Live Science.\nDigital Fingerprints for Art Could Thwart Heists\nWhittman speculated that the FBI might be releasing the tape in order to confirm information on the person’s identity given by Abath. The tape is not new to the FBI, he said, but there have likely been around four generations of agents working on the case, and older investigations of the tape might not have been documented for the agents working the case now. Whittman was not aware of the tape when he was in the FBI, he told Live Science. As an undercover agent, he said, he was not looking at the case files or evidence.\nRecovering the Gardner art\nAlthough valued at $500 million, the stolen artwork is likely worth nothing to the thieves. Some of the paintings were cut from their wooden stretchers, an act that would severely damage, if not destroy them, Whittman said. And in any case, such famous works would incriminate anyone who bought them, making them worthless on the black market.
