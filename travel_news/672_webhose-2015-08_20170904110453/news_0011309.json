Fire crews battle smoky conditions, flames in Washington Page 1 of 1 \nSometimes the best vacations don’t involve plane tickets, baggage fees and airport security lines. Often they are planned at the last minute — and require nothing more than your weekender bag, half a tank of gas and a sense of adventure. They’re called staycations, and part of their allure is the relative ease with which you’re able to escape everyday life. \nThe get-out-of-town plan: Go in to work early on a Friday, skip lunch and duck out around 3 p.m. As you breeze past the airport, your navigation system tells you that you’re 22 minutes from your destination. Yes, that’s right: You’re going to be lying next to the pool before you would have made it through security on your way to anywhere else. \nYou’re headed to Menlo Park — the little Mayberry that’s the cherry on top of Silicon Valley, where tree-lined streets and top-rated public schools lure families to live there. But you have been drawn by the promise of sunshine and a luxury resort. The next 48 hours are going to make you forget about the fog, the parking, the refrigerator that needed to be filled and the laundry that demanded to be done. \nFriday \nCheck in \nPull into the Rosewood Sand Hill Resort, where the friendliest bellmen in Silicon Valley greet guests and usher them to the front desk. Owned by Stanford University — which is just a mile west of the hotel — and operated by Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, the property sits on 16 breathtaking acres overlooking the Santa Cruz Mountains. During the week, the hotel hosts the movers and shakers of the tech, private equity and venture capital worlds. But on weekends, the vibe completely shifts, and those who came for power lunches are replaced by those who are here to enjoy power naps in rooms that marry European elegance with the relaxed vibe of the West Coast (and state-of-the-art technology that’s expected in this neck of the woods). 2825 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park; (650) 561-1500. www.rosewoodhotels.com/sandhill . Rooms from $625. \nRelax poolside \nIt’s 5:15 p.m. — happy hour — and the lounge chairs call your name. So does the pool. If you forgot your sunscreen, the sunscreen bar awaits with organic varieties by Coola. Take a moment to remind yourself: Your co-workers are just leaving the building, and you and your significant other are already sprawled in the afternoon sun. Your waiter appears, and you order a margarita. \nDinner alfresco \nPop by your room and freshen up for dinner — a short walk away at the resort’s own Madera. This isn’t your typical hotel restaurant. This is a Michelin-starred gem that feels casual, warm and relaxed, especially if you can snag a table on the expansive terrace overlooking the pool and beyond it, the Santa Cruz Mountains. Order the tuna crudo and the oak-grilled dry-aged rib-eye. You won’t be sorry. \nSaturday \nFuel up \nIt’s 9 a.m. You’ve made a Nespresso in your room and read the paper on your spacious balcony, and now it’s time to explore. Head to the Town & Country Village shopping center, a stone’s throw from Stanford. Here, locals line up for breakfast at Mayfield Bakery & Cafe. At the bakery, you can eat outside after ordering your carbs and caffeine at the counter — where specialties include brown sugar biscuits; ham, egg and Gruyere croissants; and morning buns. Or you can sit down at the cafe for a French omelet with blistered tomatoes, goat’s milk Gouda and fresh basil. Town & Country Village, 855 El Camino Real, Palo Alto. \nCampus tour \nStanford is a short walk away, so consider a stroll through this beautiful campus. Walk Palm Drive toward the Rodin Sculpture Garden and Cantor Arts Center, which has a diverse and impressive art collection that spans 5,000 years of art history. Other must-sees on campus: Hoover Tower, Memorial Church and the impressive Anderson Collection. 328 Lomita Drive at Museum Way, Stanford. www.museum.stanford.edu. \nPastrami perfection \nAll that walking, and you’ve earned yourself the right to lunch at the Refuge, known for its house-made pastrami and consequently celebrated for its Reuben. Regulars also praise the Philly cheesesteak sandwich — appropriately served on Amoroso rolls. 1143 Crane St., Menlo Park; (650) 319-8197. www.refugesc.com. \nGarden stroll \nHead over to the Allied Arts Guild, a unique garden oasis that’s so picturesque you must see it to understand it. A serene spot in Menlo Park, with various garden rooms to explore (don’t miss the Rose Allee), the Allied Arts Guild supports nearly 20 artists and artisans who use their spaces here for creating and selling their art. Owned and operated by the Allied Arts Guild Auxiliary, the nonprofit raises money for the Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford. 75 Arbor Road at Cambridge Ave., Menlo Park; (650) 325-2450. www.alliedartsguild.org. \nSpa time \nSense Spa at Rosewood is a serene space, tucked behind one of the property’s beautiful courtyard gardens. Known for its customized aromatherapy massages, the spa uses essential oils in combination with gentle dry brushing to exfoliate the skin. Relax on the spa patio with pomegranate tea. Take a steam and sauna. Then settle into a lounge chair and forget what time it is. \nDinner decisions \nPop up to the terrace for a glass of bubbly while you contemplate your dinner options and watch the sunset. Close by is local favorite Iberia — where fans often sit at the bar for sangria and tapas — or grab a seat on the patio for family-style meals like the house specialties: zarzuela de mariscos or paella. Flea Street Cafe delivers sustainable, seasonal food in a beautifully simple, delicious way. Don’t fill up on the house-made buttermilk biscuits, because good things are still to come — like the farmers’ lettuces and greens salad and the ricotta and chive gnocchi, or the Marin Sun Farms short ribs with crispy artichokes. Iberia, 1026 Alma St., Menlo Park; (650) 325-8981. Lunch, dinner nightly. Flea Street Cafe, 3607 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo Park; (650) 854-1226. Dinner Tuessay-Sunday. \nStar gazing \nBack at the hotel, find your way to the vista lawn for a last look up at the stars, which are never so bright in the city as they are here. \nSunday \nPower brunch \nWhether you slept in or worked out this morning, it’s time to celebrate your last staycation day with a decadent brunch at Madera. The choices range from stone fruit tartines with lemon thyme and walnuts to a lump crabmeat frittata with spinach, mushrooms and ricotta. But a mimosa will likely make your decision easier. So order one, and if you’re feeling extra special, order some deviled eggs to tide you over till breakfast arrives. \nHit the trail \nTime to say goodbye to Rosewood Sand Hill. Don’t worry, the hotel’s not going anywhere. But you need to work off that breakfast. A hiking mecca, this part of the Peninsula boasts a plethora of amazing hikes at various levels — beginner, intermediate and advanced. Five miles away, Portola Valley’s Windy Hill Open Space Preserve features 12 miles of gorgeous trails that wind through a variety of habitats. Hamms Gulch, Eagle, Razorback Ridge and Lost Trails are all favorites of hikers here. www.openspace.org . \nStress-free shopping \nSoak up your last few hours in Menlo Park. Whether you choose to hit up Kepler’s Books for an afternoon of perusing, roam the upstairs housewares shop at Draeger’s or venture to Stanford Shopping Center for the kind of stress-free shopping excursion you dream about when you’re in Union Square, it’s time to relax with a little retail therapy. Kepler’s Books, 1010 El Camino Real, Menlo Park; Draeger’s, 1010 University Drive, Menlo Park; Stanford Shopping Center, 660 Stanford Shopping Center, Palo Alto. \nOpa! at Evvia \nEnd your staycation on a high note. Have an early dinner at Evvia. Always packed, always applauded, this Greek restaurant delivers unforgettable lamb dishes. Don’t miss the traditional grilled octopus, the lamb riblets and the whole grilled fish. End with the homemade yogurt topped with toasted walnuts and dates, or baklava. Your sabbatical may be coming to an end, but the good news is, you don’t need a plane ticket or vacation days to come back and do it all again. \n420 Emerson St., Palo Alto; (650) 326-0983. Dinner nightly, lunch Monday-Friday. www.evvia.net. \nPaige Porter Fischer is a freelance writer.
