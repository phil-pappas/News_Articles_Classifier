CHAKRABORTY explores the spectacular modern architecture of London and wonders why we cannot replicate it in Indian cities. In 1991, while returning from the USA, when I first visited London, the city looked quite old and jaded. In fact, cities in Germany and France looked far more advanced with modern buildings and other city infrastructures. The UK was not doing too well economically and there was not much sense of optimism and growth. While, with its traditional attractions, the city was still attracting large number of tourists, things were taking steadily declining trends, to almost a crisis level which led the Evening Standard to publish the headline in August 1991 “Is London dying?” Fortunately during my more recent visits, I noticed that that period is definitely over. For some years now, London has been a city enjoying an excellent state of health. Once again the city is very much in demand, both to live there and to spend a vacation. A local journalist friend told me that “the days of swinging London seem to have returned, like back in the sixties when the city was a must for the young and not so young.” Indeed, the whole trend of modernizing pioneering building actually stated with Lloyd’s Insurance building with its exposed piping for plumbing in end eighties. It was followed, in 1999 by the London Eye, world’s largest observation wheel. It is also known also as Millennium Wheel since it was opened at the end of the year 1999 to celebrate new millennium. Lately, many new iconic buildings of both commercial and public institutions are helping London to exude this new found confidence. Some of these buildings have also become new tourist attractions. For a resounding proof, we only need to look at the unexpected success of the new Tate Modern in a building originally designed as a power station, and since 2000 dedicated to contemporary art. This led to the idea of making an 11-story extension nearby. Completed just in time for the Olympic Games in 2012, it is the new awe inspiring structure of the city. The design in the form of a striking pyramid is by Herzog and de Meuron who also created the previous museum. The exhibits inside are also exciting and aptly represent the city’s cultural dynamism. This led me to revisit another most revered cultural destination of the city, the British Museum. Even though the extension, completed in 2003 following the roofing of the large internal courtyard is less creative, it is by no means less attractive. It was designed by Lord Norman Foster, also responsible for some of the most conspicuous buildings of the new London. One of the earliest of such modern buildings is the City Hall(opened in 2002). The headquarters of Greater London Authority and the Mayor of London, it was designed by Norman Foster and is located on the south bank of the River Thames. Its unusual bulbous shape intended to reduce the building’s surface area and thus improve energy efficiency. Architect supposedly saw the building as a giant sphere hanging over the Thames River, but in the public it has been compared to a misshapen egg or motorcycle helmet. Foster followed that success with another striking piece of architecture, the Swiss Re Skyscraper, completed in 2004, and which everybody calls The Gherkin. With its 41 floors, it is one of the tallest buildings in the city, though it is now overtaken by the 70-floors and 306-metres of the London Bridge Tower, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. Located in Southwark, a previously rundown area, it will be the symbol of the urban renewal. Informally referred as The Shard, it is currently the tallest skyscraper in European Union. At the top, it offers 360 degree open-air observation deck and 40 KM views across the London skyline and beyond. London is a constantly changing city, so that people who come back after being away for a few years are always impressed by the changes, often significant, that have taken place in the skyline. I must say that these changes have become increasingly frequent since the year 2000. The time has long past since the city was afraid to change and many projects were challenged and blocked out of fear of changing the city’s image. Today, no opportunity is lost to plan buildings with special character and style. Fortunately London has always had a highly efficient underground network. Some recently built stations are architecturally attractive and are worth a visit, especially the ones connecting the City with the renovated docklands where immense areas formally occupied by warehouses have been converted into office and residential complexes. Canary Wharf Station by Norman Foster is especially fine. Those who do not want to trek from one building to another while still appreciating London can visit the many pubs and restaurants outfitted by top local designers. For example, one’s first stop could be the Konstam at the Prince Albert, a restaurant designed by Thomas Heatherwick, considered by many critics to be one of the most talented young British designers. Heatherwick also designed the new bridge over the Thames called Mills Bridge and the amazing Rolling Bridge along Paddington Basin, which every Friday at noon rolls up into a ball, leaving the boats free to pass thorough. “During the event,” says a renowned travel journalist,” there are no huge crowds of people. However, the show is much more fun and interesting than the more crowded changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.” Share this Post:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T06:51:55.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
