The requirement for creating engaging environments that appeal to the senses and enhances the clients visit are paramount to the service provider’s arsenal. Providing ‘the’ experience which compliments the offering is becoming ever more essential to aiding client retention.\nIntegrating these technologies proves challenging as typically clubs, bars and restaurants conform to the same ethos as in hi-end residential projects where ‘Interior Design’ is fundamental to the finished product.\nThis is where ad notam as the leading global manufacturer of discrete custom glass and mirror TVs comes into its own. World renowned companies such as Claridges, The Shangri-La, Savoy, Eccleston Square and Lanesborough have all invested in ad notam and with great effect.\nad notam customisability is widely understood and typically sets the bench mark when it comes to configuring bespoke solutions that these environments really need. What is key to these types of projects however are the commercial qualities and robust nature of the ad notam system that will serve your clients’ best interests. ad notam screens are designed for 24/7 use, have higher heat resistance and are compatible with the leading hospitality TV/Service providers in this field.\nad notam’s range of coloured glass, printed glass and mirrors means there is a finish to suit any desired theme. Glass does not just mean a classy look but protects the screen in higher footfall locations and is by nature much easier to keep clean; a very important feature for areas conforming to strict hygiene legislation.\nAs ad notam also has the largest available screen to work as a dedicated In-Wall behind glass TV system at 84” inch (starting at 13.3” in the range) the desired level of impact is sure to be achieved. Pro-AV control through RS232 as standard and flexible IR features ensures seamless integration. Further supported with a wide variety of fitting solutions and accessibility options ad notam screens make it easier on you for installation and ongoing maintenance of your clients investment.\nWhatever the need, simply as background entertainment or as a subtle yet effective way to communicate remotely with the clientele an ad notam screen will provide you with the ability to satisfy any exacting specifications.\nNOVASONAR\nInvisible audio has always been seen as a little awkward to integrate. Novasonar, one of the European mainland’s leading flat panel speaker manufacturers, has tackled this issue head on.\nNovasonar flat panel speakers are by far the easiest to install. Simply, these speakers need ‘no’ back boxes to be set in. In addition to this the transducer technology can be, specified with a choice of building materials (including: plaster board, melamine, acrylics formica, glass, thin stone etc.\nAs standard, the Dynamic Series speakers come with a 12mm gypsum board facing for quick, seamless and hassle free integration. This typically covers the majority of installations specified. The flexible and logical approach Novasonar has taken means installers are working with materials they are used to working with and creates less stress on-site.\nTo back this up, and with the support of Novasonar, Unicam, the UK distributor, is providing an acoustic engineering service to advise on the best placement and system configuration using Novasonar panels. Drawings of each installation can be submitted and the acoustic arrangement will be configured and returned for the custom integrator and client to review.\nCompared to regular loudspeakers, Novasonar flat panels radiate sound waves for all frequencies equally (180 degrees), this being much more efficient than with regular loudspeakers. Regular speakers start bundling the sound waves when the tone becomes higher, this then creates a sweet spot for the listener. Flat panels don’t do this, they fill the room homogeneously, spreading sound waves which allow you to sit almost anywhere in the room and still perceive high quality spatially correct sound. There is no one square meter sweet spot, it is like as you experience in the theatre (seats from wall to wall) and typically there are less speakers needed to cover the same area.\nThe Novasonar speaker’s membrane comes from high-tech, precision aircraft manufacturing, the transducers used (loudspeaker motors) are of the highest quality to be robust and hard wearing. In addition Novasonar speakers have an electronic fuse for protection, built in as standard, to safeguard against driving amplifiers into clipping. This circuit simply resets if tripped for continual safe use of the embedded speaker panels.\nNovasonar is built to the latest possible technical standards, offering invisible yet high quality sound. In this light they have created a subwoofer, which can be built in the wall as well. The sub is a 2-channel sub, only showing a small vent slot (1cm x 50cm), preferably mounted relatively close to the floor. The sub is 6cm deep making it easy to integrate and kept out of sight. This product is unique in that it is designed to be resonance free so that it does not vibrate the wall it is built in. Together with the flat panels this solution provides a very good way to combine the best possible interior decoration without any visual disruption. So much so Novasonar have reported the growth in sales of the subwoofer alone as it is currently been specified in systems using regular speaker configurations simply as it is easy to hide and produces high quality low end information.\nHotel Feature\nHotels are the pinnacle of hospitality based AV integration. These environments lead the way when it comes to both interior design influenced applications, in the guest rooms, and commercialised systems in the hotels public areas; such as café, restaurant, spa, salon, pool, lifts, lounges and night club.\nSpecifically, having such a wide variety of placement opportunity for video screens the challenge is how the integrator installs the panels. The screens need to be effective yet unobtrusive as to not detract from the theme that these hotels invest heavily considered sums of money into.\nad notam is the world’s leading manufacture in this field and boasts a client list that includes such names as Shangri-La, Café Royal, Lanesborough, Claridges and Rosewood London. These global organisations have realised the benefits that ad notam systems bring across their portfolio and the value they offer in any location within the hotel environment.\nDiscrete installation in the bedrooms, fully waterproof applications in bathrooms, spas and pool areas plus niche custom solutions in lifts, behind bars and in washrooms; ad notam can apply itself conveniently and seamlessly in all instances.\nad notam’s ability to provide this level of flexibility comes from their comprehensive choice of glass finishes which includes coloured glass, printed effects and mirrors. This is further enhanced by having an extensive choice of screen sizes ranging from 13.3” up to the largest available in this screen category at 84”. And to top it off, totally unique concepts can be configured utilising a range of additional options, only available through ad notam, which include heating foils, through glass LED clocks, soft touch through glass control and etched LED through glass lighting.\nFeatures don’t stop there. For the integrator there is pro AV control with RS232 as standard and flexible IR facilities. ad notam also benefits from accreditation with all the major hospitality TV service providers. For reliability, all ad notam screens are designed on a commercial platform for use 24/7 and have higher heat resistance to that of consumer based technologies used by entry level overlay systems.\nWhatever the need, simply as background entertainment or as a subtle yet effective way to communicate remotely with the clientele an ad notam screen will provide you with the ability to satisfy any exacting specifications.\nNuLine AV Furniture\nIt is widely accepted that in order to mount a TV on to a wall, you would need to drill to mount cumbersome brackets and chisel through plaster and brickwork to bury unsightly cables; all of which would then mean redecorating! Alternatively, you could install surface mounted space age aluminium tubing, hiding the numerous cables linking the TV to the entertainment equipment; but still very much looking like an afterthought!\nBorn from these expensive, time consuming and crude solutions comes the concept of the “wall in front of a wall”. This method creates a free channel to facilitate any number of optical, HDMI, power and speaker cables and is the primary rationale behind the NuLine AV Furniture system from Unicam.\nUnicam has created a simple, easy to hang, decorative wall panel system that both end user and professional installer can intuitively master. The panels are mounted on slim line brackets, creating a false wall and requires NO remedial works to existing decoration.\nThe flexible modular design of NuLine can be specified to produce a variety of configurations and sizes which could even prevent the need to plaster and decorate in some instances. Alternatively, the NuLine system can be produced as manageable wall panels to simply mount the TV in 3 simple steps…. measure, drill, hang.\nAn extensive choice of finishes is available from standard colours and wood grains to concrete and leather, not to mention speciality themed printed solutions. You can even specify an unfinished surface, ready for wallpaper, allowing the unit to match in with an existing theme.\nThe NuLine AV furniture range is a lightweight modular system, which means that at any time in the future the unit can be easily expanded, modified or moved to an alternative location.\nThis system is made up of individual panels, which can simply slide to the side, allowing access to install additional cables or carry out any servicing/maintenance that may be required.\nThis unique system is future proof, as no matter what new connectivity is developed, there will always be sufficient cable management and access.\nLighting can be added to the system by means of LED down lights in the display option, or by creating a halo wash effect on the rear of the panels.\nSource:- Hotel Vision", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:34:14.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
