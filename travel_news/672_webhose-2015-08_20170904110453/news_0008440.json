Credit: sxc.hu \nThere are many reasons a flight can get cancelled- but this is the first time we've heard of a cancellation due to a plane hitting a kangaroo. \nThis is what happened to a Melbourne-bound passenger plane in Victoria. \nRex Airlines flight ZL3653 was cancelled after the plane's right propeller hit a kangaroo during takeoff, damaging the propeller, the Herald Sun reported. \nThe incident occurred at the Mildura Airport at 6.30am on Thursday. \nThis is the first time a plane has hit a kangaroo in six years at the airport, the Sunraysia Daily reported. \nWhether or not the animal survived is unclear.
