The event featured guest speaker Ruben Acosta, the Nebraska State Historical Society Register Coordinator, who said his office had to use a different approach to get the cabin added to the registry. \nThe Beatrice Daily Sun ( http://bit.ly/1NqBNfx ) reports that the structure didn't fit the criteria for a historical cabin because it was moved from its original location, so it was added under the criteria for a mid-century museum. \nThe cabin was built near Blue Springs in 1855 and moved to Blue Springs Park in 1949. \nInformation from: Beatrice Sun, http://www.beatricedailysun.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:41:30.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
