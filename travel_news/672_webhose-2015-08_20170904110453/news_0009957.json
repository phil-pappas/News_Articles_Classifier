The first we heard of it was when one of Gerard’s friends texted his girlfriend to say he had broken his neck and she contacted us. \n“Then they texted to say he had just winded himself but Gerard said he knew himself something wasn’t right. It turned out he had broken his back in two places.” \nMr McCabe and his wife, Edith, booked flights to Ibiza as soon as they heard the news and arrived last Thursday. \n“It was very hard to see Gerard in the hospital bed, it was very emotional,” said Mr McCabe. \n“We just wanted to get out to him. The doctor has told us Gerard was minutes away from being paralyzed because the swelling was so bad around his spine. \n“He is very upset and is intensive care, he is crying on and off because of the pain. \n“The hospital has been great but there is only so much morphine they can give him. \n“Everything is so expensive out here, apartments we have looked at cost 200 Euros a night so we’re hoping someone will rent us somewhere for the next four or five weeks while Gerard goes through his operation and starts his recovery.” \nMr McCabe’s accident comes weeks after the father of a man who died suddenly in Ibiza issued a warning to young people travelling to the party island. \nAlan Drennan from Newtownabbey was found dead in his hotel room on July 19. He had only arrived on the Spanish island for a holiday the day before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:35:39.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
