The ship will be towed down the Ems River before beginning Sea Trials on Sept. 16. \nThe Escape is the line's first ship since 2013's Getaway. The line will have 14 ships with Escape's sister ship Norwegian Bliss due in 2017 and two more Breakaway Plus class ships on order for 2018 and 2019. \nEscape becomes the largest Norwegian Cruise Line ship to sail out of Miami and also claiming the line's biggest ship crown from Norwegian Epic. Its Caribbean voyages will make ports of call in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; Tortola, British Virgin Islands and Nassau, Bahamas. \nEscape has a lot of Miami and South Florida influences, from the hull artwork from marine wildlife artist Guy Harvey to the first Margaritaville at Sea. Also on board will be a version of Miami's famed Tobacco Road blues bar, a craft beer hall partnering with Wynwood Brewing Company and a dining partnership with restaurateurs Jose Mendin, Andreas Schreiner and Sergio Navarro of The Pubbelly Restaurant Group, which has opened six dining concepts in South Florida in the past three years. \nOther notable features of the ship include the largest water park at sea, largest ropes course at sea, a spa with a snow room and Tony Award-winning musical productions \"Million Dollar Quartet\" and \"After Midnight\" as well as an ode the 80s films of director John Hughes like \"The Breakfast Club.\" \nrtribou@tribpub.com, 407-420-5134", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:29:58.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
