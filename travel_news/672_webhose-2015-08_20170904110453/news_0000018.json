Volcano drama ... Despite expecting to resume service into Denpasar, Jetstar and Virgin Australia has been forced to cancel more flights Source: News Corp Australia \nFLIGHTS to and from Bali have been cancelled after a volcanic ash cloud from Indonesia’s Mount Raung made conditions unsuitable for flying. \nAll but four of Virgin Australia’s Monday services have been cancelled and those still scheduled to go ahead in the afternoon are under review. \n“We have been advised that Mt Raung continues to erupt and winds are blowing in an unfavourable direction,” Virgin Australia said in a statement. \nJetstar has scheduled seven flights to Denpasar Airport, and five flights from the Indonesian island to Australia on Monday. Five flights have been cancelled. Mount Raung volcano emits steam and ash in Banyuwangi.
