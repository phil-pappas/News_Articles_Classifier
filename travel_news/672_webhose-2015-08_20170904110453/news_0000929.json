A panel of travel experts will share updates on travel to Cuba including legal considerations and interactive “people-to-people” programs designed to immerse visitors in the country’s everyday life by facilitating memorable contact between Americans and Cubans.\nJohn McAuliff, Fund for Reconciliation and Development executive director, will moderate the session, Selling Cuba, which will feature Tessie Aral, owner and operator, ABC Charters; Andrea Holbrook, president & CEO, Holbrook Travel; William Hauf, president, Island Travel & Tours, Ltd.; Nicholas Filippidis, director of product development, North America, Celestyal Cruises; and Ben Barron, foreign affairs officer, U.S. Department of State’s Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation.\n“Shrouded in mystery for decades, Cuba will be ripe for selling as part of travel packages,” said Marilyn McHugh, Questex Travel Group vice president of global events. “Our experts will provide the latest insights on how to sell this culturally rich Caribbean gem.”\nTravel Industry Exchange will bring travel professionals and lifestyle specialists together with international suppliers, including destinations, hoteliers, cruise lines, tour operators, transportation providers, technology companies, spas and resorts.
