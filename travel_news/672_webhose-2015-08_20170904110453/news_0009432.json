The WHA expects to reduce its fleet from 44 to 38 vehicles and save an average of more than $25,000 per year in operating expenses.\nIn Wilmington , Enterprise Fleet Management will provide 38 cargo vans, pickup trucks and mid-sized sedans for use by WHA maintenance and management teams. Enterprise analyzed WHA's fleet needs to help identify ways to manage the fleet more efficiently. As a result, the new strategy includes downsizing the fleet and introducing several different vehicle models. The new vehicles have better fuel economy and lower emissions; they also require less maintenance.\n\"WHA is home to nearly ten percent of Wilmington's population, so this is really an investment in our residents and the City of Wilmington ,\" said Frederick S. Purnell, Sr. , Executive Director of the WHA. \"With this fleet refresh, Enterprise will help us more reliably service the buildings we manage, while at the same time significantly reduce our fleet costs and carbon footprint â€“ it's a win-win for everyone.\"\nDirect funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development enables the WHA to develop and manage affordable housing for low-income families throughout the City of Wilmington .\nThe WHA had been operating an aging fleet of vehicles that were more than 10 years old and required frequent maintenance. So far, Enterprise Fleet Management has delivered nine vans to the WHA. The remaining vehicles are scheduled to be phased into the fleet over the next four years.\nWith a network of more than 50 fully-staffed offices, Enterprise manages nearly 400,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada , providing local service to businesses, government agencies and organizations that don't have a dedicated fleet manager for their medium-sized fleets. Enterprise Fleet Management also is an affiliate of Enterprise Holdings , the largest car rental company in the world.\nEnterprise will provide regular maintenance, vehicle registration, use reporting and a fuel card program that automatically monitors fuel purchases and miles for each vehicle. Enterprise will use local businesses to provide routine service and delivery of the vehicles. Once the vehicles have reached the optimum point in their lifecycle, Enterprise will use its remarketing expertise to auction and resell some of the vehicles for the WHA. In addition, the WHA will provide an opportunity for its residents to purchase some of them as well.\n\"Replacing more than three dozen vehicles in a short period can take a big toll on an organization's financial resources,\" noted Becci Miller , Delaware area sales manager for Enterprise Fleet Management. \"We can help manage those costs with a formal strategy that enables the WHA to acquire new vehicles sooner, so they can start to realize savings faster.\"\nFor more information about Enterprise Fleet Management, visit http://www.efleets.com or call toll free 1-877-23-FLEET.\nAbout Wilmington Housing Authority\nSince its establishment in 1938, the mission of the Wilmington Housing Authority (WHA) has been to develop and maintain safe, decent, and affordable housing for low-income families in the city of Wilmington, Del.
