The grand sandstone house was built by convicts assigned to the Macarthurs while the family lived at the nearby Belgenny Farm. However, Macarthur died before the construction was completed in 1935 and his sons James and William Macarthur instead took up occupancy in the new house.\nVerge’s striking Palladian design has stood the test of time, as the house remains today largely as it was built. The surrounding farmland still operates as a working dairy farm, producing two million litres of milk each year, and is one of the last remaining in the area.\nThe mansion will be open from 12pm – 4pm on Saturday, September 19 and 10am – 4pm on Sunday September 20, 2014. In addition to guided house and garden tours, Devonshire teas, refreshments, plants and gift stores and vintage car displays will be on offer, as well as Macarthur history talks and an Australian Armoured Vehicle Association display.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:07:40.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
