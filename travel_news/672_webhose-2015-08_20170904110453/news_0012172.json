It was the first time the 22-year-old Tibetan had heard the world clearly since illness severely impaired her hearing when she was three. The problem had been caused by pressure from the cervical vertebrae, which support the head, explained Deng Tiancai, one of the two traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who treated her. “She still needs further checks and treatment,” he added. Emato is one of the 9,175 people who have benefited from a health project set up after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which killed more than 80,000 people. The project, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies and overseen by the Chinese government, has covered the Tibetan autonomous region as well as areas with large populations of ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai provinces. Most patients have been low-income herders and farmers, while about 20 per cent were Buddhist monks and nuns. Deng was among 800 doctors who volunteered for the latest mission, a seven-day tour providing free treatment in Sichuan’s mountainous Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture, which is home to about 900,000 nomads and farmers, 54 per cent of whom are ethnic Tibetan. ... herdsmen and farmers still have endemic conditions such as bone and skin disorders Air China provided 10 planes to transport the physicians and medical supplies, and upon arrival the main team was divided into six units to cover 35 towns. Medical workers screened locals for congenital heart disease,ophthalmologists removed cataracts from more than 50 people, and surgeons operated on five children. Small teams were also sent deep into the grasslands to visit isolated farmers. Despite government efforts to improve living standards in isolated regions, herdsmen and farmers still have endemic conditions such as bone and skin disorders. Many of the complaints are associated with poor hygiene and a nomadic lifestyle, while high blood pressure, diabetes and heart and lung diseases are common among monks and nuns. “We conducted research into the diseases in Aba and then organised this team of volunteers to better serve the needs of local people,” said Fu Wei, a general surgeon at Peking University No 3 Hospital. Buchang Pharma, a drug company based in Beijing, donated medicine worth 9 million yuan (£900,000) to the latest mission. All the drugs were prescribed within a week. The visiting medics also set up a public health school “to make good use of the modern technology and resources in big cities to help underdeveloped areas”, according to headmaster Wang Longde, who is an expert in epidemiology. I can already see some positive changes through the evolution of the nomadic civilisation... Ding Yonghong, a physiotherapist from Beijing, said she discovered brand-new equipment for treating bone and skin complaints in “unopened, dust-covered boxes” at one clinic because the doctors there did not know how to use it. She and her assistant spent half a day training them. One of the first patients to benefit was Gomyn, a 92-yearold monk, who reported a marked reduction in the pain in his leg after just 15 minutes of radiotherapy. “I’ll come for the therapy again,” he said, giving the doctor a thumbs-up. Jamuco, a Tibetan government official in his 30s, said things are changing for the better as young people are paying more attention to health and lifestyle. “It takes time, but I can already see some positive changes have already occurred through the evolution of the nomadic civilisation and the development of Tibetan society,” he added. Looking at life from a different perspective News coverage of philanthropic work, such as free health treatments in western Sichuan province, has often portrayed those who receive aid as poor victims and those who give it as well-off saviours. Many of the people I met in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang autonomous prefecture were neither poor nor unhealthy. In Chali, where the population is about 7,000, residents make a living from selling ingredients for Chinese traditional medicine found on the grasslands, herding yaks and interacting with tourists. The average annual income in some parts is comparable with the doctors who flew in from Beijing and Shanghai to provide the free treatments. The average lifespan here is about 80 years, far higher than the national average. Nature bends our bodies, but religion makes our spirits tall and straight However, many of the endemic diseases that affect nomads have been aggravated by their lifestyle, which is closely connected to the grasslands. In one small clinic, hundreds of elderly patients with chronic diseases waited in neat lines that snaked out of the registration room. Many carried handmade walking sticks and a prayer wheel or Buddhist prayer beads, and they joked with each other and occasionally broke into laughter. The young people were all absent, having taken the yaks to the summer pastures. Unlike noisy urban hospitals filled with anxious faces, the Chali clinic resembled a happy gathering of tribal elders. They regarded their crooked legs and hunched backs as part of life. If you want to feel happy, maybe the Tibetan people can provide free treatment for you “Nature bends our bodies, but religion makes our spirits tall and straight,” said one monk in his 90s. Jamuco, a civil servant in his 30s, said Tibetan people are happy because “we do not have so much to pursue”. Turning to a group of volunteer doctors, he added: “If you want to feel happy, maybe the Tibetan people can provide free treatment for you.” The treatment provided in Aba was mutually beneficial, as the visiting urban doctors were able to learn about the land and the local religious outlook. During a speech, Beijing neurologist Li Guangwei, who headed the medical team, suggested the physicians should adopt the spirit of their patients. Having been there, I know what he means.
