Some titles are officially recognized, while others are unmeasured claims. Either way, they are lots of fun.\nIf you know of others, email kkazek@al.com .\nWorld's Smallest City Block, Dothan\nA tiny concrete triangle on East Troy Street in downtown Dothan is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Smallest City Block.

What makes it the smallest? It has one participant, a person chosen to be grand marshal and the entire parade. The parade is also fairly short, from the Coffee County Courthouse to the famed Boll Weevil Monument, but it draws a large crowd of onlookers.

The Mallet Assembly is sort of like a fraternity for \"unconventional thinkers,\" according to its website. It is a residence for honors students named for its original home, Mallet Hall. Each year since about 1980, members of the Mallet Assembly have set aside Fat Tuesday for what they bill the \"World's Smallest Mardi Gras Parade,\" according to alumnus Chris Luehmann. It features a person chosen as that year's king or queen riding in the back of a truck with a member of the university's Million Dollar Band on either side. The parade moves along a short route on sorority row.\nWorld's Smallest Airport Runway, various locations\nGreg Koontz of Ashville is not only a stunt-plane pilot, he is also a comedian. So he combines his talents and offers comic airshows. One of his most popular acts is landing his small plane on what he bills as the \"World's Smallest Airport Runway:\" the bed of a pickup truck. Yep. At each show, Koontz wows the crowd by landing on a specially rigged truck bed.

He had osteogenesis imperfecta . Moore, who was 18 inches tall and weighed 32 pounds, was highly intelligent, according to the website phreeque.com , but was not allowed to attend school for much of his life. He married and had two children, one normal sized and one with the same disorder. Moore died of heart failure in 1984.

Really, the miniature tower is part of a much larger \"small\" thing, the Ave Maria Grotto, billed as \"Jerusalem in Miniature.\" The grotto at St. Bernard's Abbey features tiny replicas of world-famous structures, made from concrete and found objects by a hunchback monk named Brother Joseph Zoettl. In his lifetime, Zoettl built 125 mini structures at the Abbey. It is now open as a tourist attraction.\nThe grotto includes a miniature Hanging Gardens of Babylon, St. Peter's Basilica, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Egyptian pyramids, and much more. I chose to list the replica of the Mysterious Tower of Newport, R.T., because it is so unusual. While there is likely a smaller replica of the pyramids, it is unlikely you'll find a smaller Mysterious Tower of Newport . So what is it?\nIt is the stone base of an aging windmill in Newport's Touro Park. The mystery involves its age. Historians have dated it as a mid-17 th century structure built by Gov. Benedict Arnold. However, some speculated it was built several centuries earlier, which would prove explorers came to America before Columbus. The tower has been carbon-dated but speculation about its origins continues.

If you're Tommy Flowers of University Place Middle School in Tuscaloosa, you create the World's Smallest Museum dedicated to Poe and his works â€“ in a closet.\nFlowers initially created the tiny museum called Edgar's Closet in 2008 but the school was destroyed by a tornado on April 27, 2011, and many of the collectibles were damaged. Flowers salvaged what he could and, when the school was rebuilt, he reopened Edgar's Closet in his classroom with about 1,000 objects. Flowers said students have become much more interested in the classics. The museum has been recognized as the World's Smallest Museum by the World's Record Association. Recognition from Guinness World Records is pending, he said.\nJoin al.com reporter Kelly Kazek on her weekly journey through Alabama to record the region's quirky history, strange roadside attractions and tales of colorful characters.
