There are shrines which are built beautifully to create that spiritual essence among devotees. However some of these are known for their not so conventional rituals which are mind-boggling. From alcohol offerings made to God, to a bike that is worshiped for safety, we bring to you the ten most weird and fascinating temples of India. Stambheshwar Mahadev, Gujarat Popularly known as the disappearing temple, it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The unique part of this temple is that being located on the coast it gets submerged during high tide and can only be seen during low tide.

The temple is dedicated to Lord Kal Bhairav Nath. Devotees offer wine or other alcoholic drinks to this deity and in return they get the same as “ Prasad ”. You will also find stalls that sell alcohol outside the temple for better convenience.

There are 9 small fires around the temple which have been burning for decades.

Strangely the bike kept disappearing from the police station where it was kept for further investigation, only to be found at the crash site. So it was finally turned into a spot for visitors to come and pray for a safe journey.
