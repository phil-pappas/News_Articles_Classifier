Together with the USD 0.25 dividend paid in May, this brings the total dividend paid this year to USD 0.87 in line with the Company's dividend policy to distribute 80% of net earnings for each fiscal year excluding exceptional items such as gains or losses on the disposal of vessels. The interim dividend of USD 0.62 will be payable as from 22 September 2015 . The shares will trade ex-dividend as from 9 September 2015 (record date 10 September 2015 ). The interim dividend to holders of Euronext shares will be paid in EUR at the USD/EUR exchange rate of the record date. In view of this interim dividend payment, investors are reminded that shareholders cannot reposition their shares between the Belgian share register and the U.S. share register from Wednesday 9 September 2015 until Friday 11 September 2015 at 9 am CET .\nEuronav has applied the accounting standards IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 as of 1 January 2014 . If the Company would have continued to apply the proportionate consolidation method for its joint ventures for the first half of 2015, the adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) would have been USD 316.1 million (first half 2014: USD 108.5 million ) and the result after taxation would have remained the same.\nHighlights and activity report for the first half year of 2015\nJanuary\nOn 15 January 2015 Euronav delivered the VLCC Antarctica (2009 - 315,981 dwt) to its new owners for conversion into an FPSO. Delivery was earlier than expected, resulting in an increased sale price and a corresponding gain on disposal of assets of USD 2.1 million which was recorded in the first quarter of 2015.\nOn 20 January 2015 Euronav announced the commencement of its underwritten initial public offering in the United States of 13,550,000 ordinary shares.\nOn 23 January 2015 Euronav announced the upsizing (from the initially announced 13,550,000 shares to 16,260,000 shares) of its initial public offering in the United States as well as pricing of the offering at an issue price per share of USD 12.25 . As of this date, Euronav's shares offered in the United States commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") under the ticker symbol \"EURN\". On the same date Euronav launched its U.S. Exchange Offer which enabled shareholders to reposition their shares that were listed and tradeable on Euronext Brussels into shares listed and tradeable on the NYSE.\nOn 28 January 2015 Euronav announced the closing of its initial public offering of 18,699,000 shares at a public offering price of USD 12.25 per share for gross proceeds of USD 229,062,750 . This includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their overallotment option of 2,439,000 shares.\nOn 31 January 2015 the 250 remaining outstanding fixed rate senior unsecured convertible notes due 2015, with a face value of USD 100,000 each, were fully redeemed at par. Euronav held 18 of these notes. Currently, there are no convertible notes outstanding.\nFebruary\nOn 6 February 2015 Euronav's share capital was increased following the mandatory contribution in kind of 30 outstanding perpetual convertible preferred equity instruments issued on 13 January 2014 which resulted in the issuance of 9,459,283 new ordinary shares. Currently, there are no perpetual convertible preferred equity instruments outstanding.\nOn 19 February 2015 and following the closing of its initial public offering on the NYSE, Euronav repaid the USD 235.5 million note issued to partly finance the acquisition of 15 VLCCs as announced on 5 January 2014 . As the note was issued below par, in accordance with IFRS, the Company amortized USD 20.4 million (non-cash) in the fourth quarter of 2014, bringing the amortization related to this note for the full year 2014 to USD 31.9 million (non-cash) and a further USD 4.1 million (non-cash) in the first quarter of 2015.\nOn 26 February 2015 Euronav took delivery of the VLCC Hirado (2011 - 302,550 dwt) which was the third vessel delivered as part of the acquisition of four modern Japanese-built VLCC vessels announced on 8 July 2014 .\nMarch\nOn 23 March 2015 Euronav closed its U.S. Exchange Offer which enabled shareholders to reposition their shares that were listed and tradeable on Euronext Brussels into shares listed and tradeable on the NYSE.\nOn 30 March 2015 Euronav announced that a total of 42,919,647 shares that were listed and tradable on Euronext Brussels were repositioned pursuant to the U.S. Exchange Offer into an equal number of shares listed and tradable on the NYSE.\nApril\nOn 1 April 2015 Euronav announced the adoption of a new dividend policy for the group going forward. Euronav intends to distribute 80% of its annual net result. The yearly dividend will be paid in two instalments: first as an interim dividend paid in September, then as a payment of the balance corresponding to the final dividend paid in May of the following year after receiving shareholders' approval.\nOn 9 April 2015 Euronav took delivery of the VLCC Hakata (2010 - 302,550 dwt) which was the last vessel delivered as part of the acquisition of four modern Japanese-built VLCC vessels announced on 8 July 2014 .\nOn 27 April 2015 the temporary difference between Euronav's ordinary shares tradable on the NYSE and its ordinary shares tradable on Euronext Brussels expired. Since this date all ordinary shares have the same rights and privileges in all respects. As of 28 April 2015 all Euronav shares are fully fungible and are able to trade on both NYSE and Euronext Brussels.\nMay\nOn 13 May 2015 the General Meeting of Shareholders approved the gross dividend of USD 0.25 per share as proposed by the Board of Directors. This dividend was paid from profits carried forward over financial year 2014 and on this occasion considered part of the new dividend policy for 2015.\nJune\nOn 16 June 2015 Euronav announced the acquisition through resale of newbuilding contracts of four VLCCs - currently under construction at Hyundai Heavy Industries - for an aggregate purchase price of USD 384 million or USD 96 million per vessel. The vessels are scheduled for prompt delivery as early as September 2015 , January 2016 , March 2016 and May 2016 , respectively. In addition and against the payment of an option fee of an aggregate amount of USD 8 million , the seller has also agreed to grant Euronav an option to acquire up to an additional four VLCCs which are sister vessels to the initial four VLCCs, at a purchase price of USD 98 million each.\nGiven the volatility of the tanker markets, the Board of Euronav NV has carefully reviewed all potential impairment indicators such as the freight environment as well as the current market value of the fleet compared to its carrying amount. Based on this review, the Board of Directors concluded that no impairment test was required at 30 June 2015 . The Board will continue to closely monitor developments in the tanker market and review possible impairment indicators again at each reporting date.\nThe Board of Directors, represented by Peter G. Livanos , its Chairman, and the Executive Committee, represented by Paddy Rodgers , Chief Executive Officer and Hugo De Stoop , Chief Financial Officer, hereby confirm, in the name and for account of Euronav that, to the best of their knowledge, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2015 which have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view, of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation as a whole. The half year management report includes a fair overview of the important events that have occurred during the first half year and of the major transactions with the related parties, and their impact on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remainder of the financial year.\nOn behalf of the Board of directors:\nPaddy Rodgers Peter G.
