Welcoming club professionals and amateurs alike, golfers can enjoy six days and five nights of championship golf, luxury accommodations, exquisite Hawaiian cuisine, prizes, and more.\n“Our Robert Trent Jones Sr.-designed course has always proven challenging for all levels of golfers,” said Josh Silliman, Mauna Kea director of golf. “When the fairways were lengthened in 2008 by son Rees Jones and our 99 bunkers enlarged, the challenge continued, right along with all the special memories this legendary course provides.”\nPro-Am entry fees begin at $3,620 including taxes, accommodations for five nights, daily breakfast, practice and tournament rounds, special dinner events, hospitality room, amenity tournament gifts, and prizes. Airfare is also included for each team’s golf professional, who will compete for a professional prize-purse of $10,000, based on a full field of 25 teams.\nIn honor of the resort’s 50th anniversary, Pro-Am participants can take advantage of the following special offers: $50 parking and internet for the duration of a player’s stay, $50 golf guest fee for spouse, and $50 late checkout until 8 p.m. on the day of departure.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T21:01:07.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
