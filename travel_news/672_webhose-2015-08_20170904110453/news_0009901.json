Liquidity over the fixings was shocking and saw the rand hit a firmer level of R12.5810 before closing back up near R12.6800,\" he said.\nHe expected the rand to be range-bound for the day between R12.64 and R12.77 to the dollar. There are plenty of country-specific manufacturing data out on Monday, which \"could give us further clues as to the state of global growth\".\n\"Pretty poor\" data would affect both risky assets and commodity-based currencies, such as the rand, Mr Butler said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:25:45.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
