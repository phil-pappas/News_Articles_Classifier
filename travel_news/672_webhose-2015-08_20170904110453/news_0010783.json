American Airline's AAdvantage program is one of the largest and longest running travel rewards programs. AAdvantage is a free program that awards miles for each ticket purchased on American, its partners, AmericanAirlines credit card, or one of many other programs that American runs. \nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage Miles can be redeemed for travel on American or any of its many OneWorld partners.
