Come on, sing along (young and sweet, only 17) with Anni-Frid, Bjorn, Benny and Agnetha. \nMind you, her bandmates are holograms, the Dancing Queen music is from a karaoke track and this is no packed concert hall, it’s the ABBA Museum in Stockholm , Sweden, the band’s hometown. \nArriving in Stockholm via the Disney Magic cruise ship , my wife is single-minded. We have to race to the museum to be there as soon as it opens. \nIn fact, we arrive 15 minutes before the 10 a.m. opening, but we are by no means first in line. \nAnd before we even get to buy our $25 tickets to gain entry, we hear a good chunk of the ABBA catalogue blared from loudspeakers, from the famous Dancing Queen, Mamma Mia and Waterloo to Knowing Me Knowing You, Money Money Money and SOS. \nTechnically, this is the Swedish Music Hall of Fame , but the large ABBA component was added in 2013 and everyone is here to pay homage to the famous quartet. \nFor ABBA aficionados, like my wife, the gratification is immediate. \nThere’s a gaudy lineup of the stage costumes and platform boots that could only be from the band’s 1970s heyday. \nThere are walls of platinum records, a recreation of ABBA’s recording studio, reams of photos and band tidbits, a couple of dance rooms and the aforementioned concert mock-up where my wife and a string of other zealots take to the stage for a moment of nostalgic glory. \nABBA’s music has only gained momentum since the band broke up in 1982. The smash Mamma Mia! musical opened in 1999 and is still playing worldwide, while the blockbuster movie of the same name hit screens in 2008. \nWe decided to keep all our activities in the Swedish capital firmly entrenched in pop culture. So it’s off to Icebar at the Nordic C Hotel . As its name indicates, the bar is completely made of ice and kept at a frigid -7 C year-round. \nAll patrons talk about is how cool, literally and figuratively, this place is. \nWe do fit in a bit of historic culture with a quick whip around Old Town to admire the Royal Palace and have a Nordic beer in the square where the Nobel Prize Museum is. \nWhen police clear the square for a motorcade of black BMWs, we speculate it’s for Sweden’s King Gustav. \nWe later learn it was for the visiting president of Tanzania. \nAnd we’ve thus come full circle, because ABBA first performed Dancing Queen on June 18, 1976, to honour the future Queen Silvia, who would marry Gustav the next day. \nDisney Cruise line has returned to the Baltic after a five-year absence and we’re happy it has. \nBesides the stop in Stockholm, the ship also glides into Tallinn , Estonia, for Old Town wanderings, St. Petersburg , Russia, for a canal boat ride and Helsinki , Finland, for a visit to a reindeer park. \nWe also enjoy all the recentlyrenovated 2,700-passenger, 884-foot-long, 11-deck boat has to offer. While my wife and daughter get matching manipedis at the spa, I lounge on the balcony of our stateroom and watch the ocean go by. \nThe writer was a guest of Disney Cruise.
