Previously, Singapore Airlines offered a variable frequency of 10 to 14 flights a week to the capital of the Maldives. Now, together with SilkAir’s new services, both airlines will offer a total of two round-trip services a day, subject to regulatory approval.\nSingapore Airlines’ Senior Vice President Marketing Planning, Ms Lee Wen Fen, said: “By synergising the networks of both carriers, we are able to provide customers more choice and greater flexibility when planning their travel itineraries. This is another example of the Singapore Airlines Group’s commitment to continuously expanding our combined network and enhancing connectivity options for our customers.”\nSilkAir’s Chief Executive, Mr Leslie Thng, said: “The Maldives is a popular travel destination offering great beauty both above and below the water, with its stunning white sand beaches and equally beautiful underwater world. We are glad to be able to join Singapore Airlines to bring travellers from around the world to this picturesque island destination.”\nDetails of flight numbers and schedules for services between Singapore and Male are as follows (timings listed are local):\nServices from 25 October 2015\nSingapore (SIN) to Male (MLE) Flights:\nFlight\nDays of Operation\nDeparture\nArrival\nSQ452\nDaily\nSIN 2035hrs*\nMLE 2210hrs\nOperated by Singapore Airlines\nMI482\nMon Tue Wed Thu\nSIN 1005hrs\nMLE 1140hrs\nOperated by SilkAir\nSQ462\nFri Sat Sun\nSIN1005hrs\nMLE1140hrs\nOperated by Singapore Airlines\nSQ452 timings from 25Oct15 to 20Nov15: SIN 2020hr MLE 2210hr\nMale (MLE) to Singapore (SIN) Flights:\nFlight\nDays of Operation\nDeparture\nArrival\nSQ451\nDaily\nMLE 2325hrs\nSIN 0715hrs (+1)\nOperated by Singapore Airlines\nMI481\nMon Tue Wed Thu\nMLE 1255hrs\nSIN 2045hrs\nOperated by SilkAir\nSQ461\nFri Sat Sun\nMLE 1255hrs\nSIN2045hrs\nOperated by Singapore Airlines\nSource:- SilkAir", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:15:16.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
