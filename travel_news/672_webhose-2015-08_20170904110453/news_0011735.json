That’s the headline from the Department for Transport’s (DfT) latest survey of road accidents, based on data from 2013. It reveals a 43pc drop in the number of casualties caused by collisions since 2000. Even so, there are certain groups of motorists whose risk profile remains high, and business drivers are among them. A simple equation indicates why that should be so. Company car drivers tend to clock up above-average mileages as they travel around the country. And the more time you spend in a car, the greater your chance of being involved in an accident. “People who drive more than 25,000 miles per year have the same occupational fatality risk as deep-sea divers,” explains Volvo Cars UK’s head of business sales, Selwyn Cooper. “That’s a sobering thought for people who might not think of their work as dangerous.” Mr Cooper regards this as a strong argument for choosing the safest possible company car. He goes on to say that Volvo’s range of safety features helps mitigate the risks facing fleet drivers. City Safety plays a crucial role in reducing the likelihood of a rear-end collision An example is City Safety, which works with Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection to combat one of the most common causes of accidents: drivers failing to look properly. According to the DfT, this was responsible for a quarter of all fatalities, 36pc of serious-injury accidents, and 43pc of all slight injuries on UK roads in 2013. Using sensors, City Safety is standard on all new Volvo Cars and has options to work also with Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection. It monitors the road ahead and alerts drivers to potential obstacles in their way. If a crash looks likely, it pre-charges the vehicle’s brakes, enhancing their responsiveness for an emergency stop. What is more, if the driver doesn’t react to the danger, the brakes engage automatically, either minimising the impact or stopping the car completely. “City Safety plays a crucial role in reducing the likelihood of a rear-end collision, especially in built-up areas,” Mr Cooper reports. “It also protects other road users, including at-risk groups such as cyclists and children.” That’s good news for everyone who travels on UK roads, and it makes particularly good sense for fleet operators. By reducing the number of rear-end collisions involving their vehicles, companies can keep their insurance costs down and prevent the reputational damage caused by accidents involving their staff. There’s a more important issue than finance, of course, and that’s the preservation of human life. Volvo Cars has made this its guiding principle, and one of its aims is that, by 2020, no one will be killed or seriously injured while travelling in one of its new cars. Features such as Dynamic Stability Traction Control (DSTC) and anti-skid brakes are helping Volvo Cars attain this ambition. They reduce the number of accidents caused by loss of control, which is the most common contributory factor to fatal accidents. And if a crash does happen, equipment such as Volvo’s renowned Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) minimises the harm caused. “Of course,” remarks Mr Cooper, “prevention is better than cure. That’s why we’ve introduced technology such as the Lane Departure Warning, the Blind Spot Information System and Active Cruise Control, to help keep motorists as safe as possible.” All of these features monitor the road and help drivers avoid collisions with other vehicles. They’re a valuable tool in reducing risk, and Mr Cooper says they’re especially popular among company car drivers who spend a lot of their time on the UK’s motorway network. “Anything that makes the roads safer is good news for everyone,” he concludes. “For business drivers travelling large distances on a daily basis, our safety technology is especially important, and could make all the difference to their wellbeing.” • Find out more about how Volvo Cars is making Britain's roads safer by calling the Volvo Car Business Centre on 0345 600 4027 or visit volvocars.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T00:24:26.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
