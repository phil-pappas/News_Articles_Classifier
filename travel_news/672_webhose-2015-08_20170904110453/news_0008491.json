The closest airports to the resort are Murcia, a 20-minute drive, or Alicante (one hour).\nFeaturing a series of challenging rides on a variety of routes, with a total distance covered across the week of 635km (400 miles), the price also features daily breakfast, a welcome drink and snack on the first night and gala dinner on the final evening, refreshments including energy gels and sports drinks during rides, full cycling kit, insurance and access to the La Manga Club spa.\n“We are offering a unique opportunity for cyclists of all levels to enjoy their favourite sport, being looked after like true professionals and with the bonus of the incomparable setting here at La Manga Club, as well as the privileged facilities on offer at the resort,” said Chad Harpur, sports director at La Manga Club.\nThe camp, which will feature a maximum of 15 people, will signal the start of a series of cycling camps at La Manga Club, with future dates set to be announced soon. The resort’s enviable location (set alongside a natural park, two seas and a mining mountain range), the Mediterranean climate and an array of first-class facilities make it one of the top national destinations for cycling and triathlon, among other sports.\nSet in an area three times the size of Monaco, La Manga Club is the official overseas training base of the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and recent accolades include being named best golf hotel in Spain at both the 2014 World Golf Awards and 2015 Today’s Golfer Travel Awards – for the fourth successive year.\nAs well as golf and tennis, the resort’s other facilities include a new Leadbetter Golf Academy – the only one in mainland Spain – a new High Performance Sports Centre and a 2,000sqm spa and fitness centre. It also offers the choice of a five-star hotel, four-star serviced apartments and townhouses.\nLa Manga Club is regularly chosen to host junior sports academies by some of the biggest names in sport including global football giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, while children can also enhance their sporting skills at one of the resort’s own academies – with golf, tennis, cricket, rugby, football and triathlon among the activities available.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:16:43.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
