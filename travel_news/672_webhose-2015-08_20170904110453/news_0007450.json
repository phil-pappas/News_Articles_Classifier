It's titled \"Wishing on You,\" an interactive work by the Brooklyn-based artists Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller known as FAILE. The artists say the sculpture explores contemporary patterns of consumption, desire and myth-making. The public can spin a hand-carved wheel to power the sculpture's red-blue-and-white lights and illuminate carnival-like features including nickel arcades and glossy ads. It was unveiled Monday. It'll remain on view on the Broadway Plaza between 42nd and 43rd streets until Sept. 1. The Brooklyn Museum is currently featuring the artists in an exhibition titled \"FAILE: Savage/Sacred Young Minds\" through Oct. 4. FAILE's art raises questions about our relationship to consumer culture, religious traditions and the urban environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T06:04:25.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
