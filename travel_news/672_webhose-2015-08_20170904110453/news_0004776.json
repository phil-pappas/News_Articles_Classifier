Not the Mass Pike so much; more the network of roads once you arrive. Back roads wind though hills and valleys, taking you from one sleepy little town to the next, stopping at world-class arts organizations along the way. You realize just how frenetic life is inside the 495 ring once you’re away from it. Alone on a twisty road, surrounded by green and blue, you can feel your blood pressure drop. A trip to the Berkshires isn’t just cultural, it’s therapeutic. So we’re on a mission to find the most scenic drive though the Berkshires. On a splendid summer day, with just enough puffy white clouds to keep it interesting, we drop the top on the convertible, and head for the hills. Hop off the Mass Pike at the Lee exit and take Route 102 to Stockbridge , a great first stop on your Berkshire Tour. There’s lots to do in this town that’s so idyllic it sometimes turned artist Norman Rockwell’s illustrations into syrup. Step off the too-busy Main Street and find the little village of shops behind the Country Store . We’ve found more than one gift for friends and family back here, including beautifully crafted wooden boxes at An American Craftsman. Further back, Mutability in Motion, opened just two years ago, presents the work of about 30 local artists. Grab lunch at the Main Street Café (I keep ordering the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad, because it’s so good). And finish it off with something sweet from Peace, Love & Chocolate. Stockbridge also has a lovely walking path at the end of nearby Park Street. Enter by crossing the beautiful Memorial suspension bridge, and then follow the path that winds along the Housatonic River . We were mostly alone with the chirp of the birds and the occasional gurgle of the gentle river. The walk is a great way to shake of the Mass Pike and that little dessert indulgence. Just a mile away, you’ll find the Norman Rockwell Museum , an exquisitely designed, landscaped and maintained museum dedicated to the work of the all-American artist. This summer, they’re featuring a delightful exhibit by New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast . How often to do look at a cartoon and laugh out loud? Not as often as you’d think or like. But there are laugh-out-loud moments waiting for anyone who appreciates Chast’s nerve-rattled view of the world. At the entrance of the Chast exhibit sits a large blow-up of a Chast classic: “The Wheel of Doom.” Various entries on the wheel: “He was too happy. He jumped off a chair and broke his metatarsal.”“Friend nearly blinded by mascara – causing infection.” Or, more succinctly, “A headache, then dead.” Page 2 of 3 - It’s a subtle reminder of why you’re standing in the Berkshires: It’s a respite from the anxieties of modern life, including deadly mascara. Just a lovely mile from the Norman Rockwell is another gorgeous Stockbridge campus: Chesterwood , the creative home of sculptor Daniel Chester French. Visit spots like this and you not only see art that endures, you also start to understand the contemplative state required by artists to do their work. But this trip is about the journey, so we’re back in the car and headed north. From Chesterwood, it’s easy to get back on Route 183. Take that all the way to Lenox . Along the way, stop at the Stockbridge Bowl, a 372-acre lake, and drink in the view. Then continue just a few minutes to the Tanglewood campus. Maybe you’re there for a concert, but Tanglewood also offers tours of its campus. You can jump on Richmond Mountain Road right where you see the entrance to Kripalu , the legendary yoga retreat that gets rave reviews from my wife, an occasional visitor. For people seeking harmony, it seems located in the perfect place. You’re now on one of the most scenic stretches we encountered on our trip, winding up a small mountain on tight turns. Keep your eyes open for Olivia’s Overlook on your left. Stop for a great photo-op of the Stockbridge Bowl framed by hills of green. When you hit a T in the road, turn right onto Route 41 (State Street). You feel far from everything at this point, but you’re about to be pulled, momentarily, from your reverie. Anyone who seeks a scenic tour of the Berkshires has to deal with Pittsfield , a bit of a smudge on this picture postcard. Pittsfield is a city that’s lost its mojo, and it’s tricky to negotiate the full sweep of the Berkshires without going right through the heart of it. But, on the positive side, it gives you the chance for a bathroom break, a cup of Dunkin or a stop at an ATM. A right turn on Route 20 brought you into Pittsfield, you’ll take Route 7 north on the way out. When you see Pontoosuk Lak e on your left, you’ve put Pittsfield behind you. Route 7 is a main artery through the Berkshires, but at this point, it’s also quite beautiful. You get some of your most panoramic views of the Berkshires from this road. For the first time since we landed in the Berkshires, we’re in fifth gear and accelerating. And with the top down and the sun out, that feels just right. Page 3 of 3 - But you’ll slow as you enter Williamstown , one of the signature hamlets in the Berkshires. The Clark Art Institute has always integrated itself beautifully into its natural surroundings, including its recent expansion. Once again, you find yourself slipping into a relaxed and introspective state as you stroll the grounds. The short drive to North Adams on Route 2 is fine, but it’s not particularly bucolic. So after a must-see stop at MASS MoCA to see art is some really exciting spaces, it’s back to nature. Take Route 8 south to Adams , then jump onto 116, then 8A to Windso r, past working farms and pastures, and up a hill that provides sweeping views, before dropping into a scenic valley. In Windsor, take Route 9 to Dalto n, where you catch Route 8, one of the most scenic stretches of this journey. The sunlight and scenery are now scented by the perfume of something in bloom, as you coast into leafy Beckett thinking, “This would be a nice place to retire.” In Becket , you’ll find the world famous Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival – maybe you have tickets – and from there you can jump on George Carter Road, which takes you to Route 20, back to Lee , the Mass Pike, and home. In the interest of full disclosure, we should tell you that in Lee you can find a huge village of outlet shops, and many people punctuate their trip to the Berkshires with a little retail therapy. Some may feel that ending this journey in a mall is like finishing a fine meal with a Twinkie. But maybe the prospect of 75 percent off makes you so giddy you’ll want to jump off a chair. Just watch out for your metatarsal. IF YOU GO: Berkshires.org is a helpful resource for anyone planning a trip to the Berkshires.
