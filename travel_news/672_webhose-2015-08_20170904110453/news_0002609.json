The Dream Cruise brought together more than 40,000 classic cars and more than a million visitors to Detroit's Woodward Avenue. \"So many special life moments that create lasting memories are connected to cars,\" said McKeel Hagerty , CEO of Hagerty. \"We wanted to find a way to rekindle those memories for couples who love their cars almost as much as they love each other.\"Using the world-famous Woodward Dream Cruise as the perfect \"car-centric\" setting for the event, participating couples were provided veils, bowties, cupcakes, sparkling apple cider and a certificate to mark the occasion. More than 150 couples participated in the vow renewals including Gordon and Geri Rinschler of Birmingham , MI who were married 47 years ago in the very same 1930 Ford Model A that they drove to renew their vows in today. Dressed in full gown and tux and witnessed by their three children and 17-year old granddaughter, who attends the Dream Cruise together every year, the Rinschlers reaffirmed their love stating \"this will certainly be a Dream Cruise to remember!\" The vow renewal event is one of many that Hagerty has hosted to recognize the important role that classic cars play in owners' lives. Last month, Hagerty hosted a classic car night at the drive-in in the Chicago -area. The Company also supports several youth advocacy programs, including the Youth Judging Program, where youth 8-14 have an opportunity to meet car owners and get an up-close look at show cars around the country, and the Hagerty Driving Experience, which introduces young drivers to operating a manual transmission. The Woodward Dream Cruise started as a fundraiser for a soccer field in Ferndale in 1995. In just a few short years, it has evolved into the world's largest one-day automotive event. Spectators and cruisers travel to metro Detroit , the birthplace of the American automobile, to demonstrate and participate in an event that celebrates an ongoing love affair with the automobile. It currently takes place along a 16-mile stretch of Detroit , and more than 50 charities benefit from the sale of official Dream Cruise merchandise and refreshments.
