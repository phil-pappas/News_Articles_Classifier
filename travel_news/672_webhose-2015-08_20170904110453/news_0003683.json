She bemoaned the weight of her bag and turned to the internet for advice but found that the tips didn’t apply to her.\n“The information was too practical, too functional. Men can turn their underwear inside out, and for women it’s not that easy,” Jimenez says.\nShe took matters into her own hands, launching the blog travelfashiongirl.com in 2012. She shares her five tips for lighter luggage.\n It’s important to think about the type of fabrics for the clothes you are taking on the trip.

The most cost-effective fabric is a polyester or synthetic blend, which can be worn over and over on a long trip. For colder destinations, long underwear made of silk or merino wool is a must.\n Choose your shoes wisely. Source: News Corp Australia\nShoes matter\nJimenez says only three pairs are necessary: one for sightseeing; one for any special activity (like a wedding or hiking); and an extra pair. A few go-to brands? Clarks, Ecco or Cole Haan. “It is worth investing in your feet,” Jimenez says. “The minute your feet give out on you, your trip is done.
