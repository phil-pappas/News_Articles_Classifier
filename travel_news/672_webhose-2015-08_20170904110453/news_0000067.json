It helps control blood sugar, reduces cholesterol and visceral fat (the health-damaging stuff that wraps around your internal organs). It is low-cal yet leaves you feeling fuller for longer. This salad is a combination of delicious, digestive, antioxidant. SERVES 2 INGREDIENTS 100g pearl barley 4 fresh figs, quartered 50g rocket leaves 2 spring onions, sliced leaves from a small bunch of flat-leaf parsley or coriander, roughly chopped 30g almonds, roughly chopped juice of 1 lemon 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil 50g feta cheese, or avocado (optional) METHOD Tip the pearl barley into a sieve and rinse well under cold filtered water to remove the excess starch. Pour into a pan and cover with cold filtered water. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer over a medium-low heat for 40–50 minutes, until tender but with a slight bite. Drain and run under cold filtered water until cool. Drain once more. Set aside in a large salad bowl. Combine the figs, rocket, spring onions, herbs and almonds with the barley. Toss through the lemon juice and oil, then crumble over the feta or slice over the avocado, depending which you are using.
