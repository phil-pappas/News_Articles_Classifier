Most of them took off from America, with airports there registering 9,553,214 commercial departures.\nThe number of flights from China reached 3,356,756, considerably higher than in 1985, when there were just 102,200.\nAir transport, registered carrier departures worldwide Data from World Bank A spectacular sunrise at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was the busiest airport in the US accommodating 95 million passengers in 2012\nTOP 10 FREQUENT FLIERS IN 2014 USA (9,553,214 flights)\nChina (3,356,756)\nCanada (1,290,420)\nUK (1,069,420)\nBrazil (937,437)\nJapan (927,437)\nGermany (913,156)\nRussia (747,804)\nTurkey (723,207)\nIndia (720,050)\nSource: World DataBank\nWhile the figures for China are steadily rising, the number of flights coming from America have fallen year upon year from a world record of 10,095,197 in 2010.\nOther frequent fliers in the top ten included Canada (1,290,420), the UK (1,069,420) and Brazil (937,437).\nFlights from Brazil and India have increased in volume at the fastest rate.\nBrazil had just 486,025 departures in 2004 and India just 231,413, but they now have 937,437 and 720,050 respectively.\nThe World DataBank , which drew on Civil Aviation Statistics of the World and ICAO staff estimates, left out some statistics from countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Barbados.\nThe only countries (sovereign states) which do not have a listed airport within their borders are Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Vatican City.\nThe Telegraph reported the annual number of crashes to be 66 so far this year, which means that flying is still by far and away the safest method of travel.\n Next The traveller who quit studying to visit 97 countries by the...

Consider 'hidden city' ticketing for serious savings\nThis is the idea of buying a cheaper airline ticket for a flight to anywhere that has a layover at your actual destination.\nIt's clearly a controversial travel trick, however. When a New York City man developed a website, Skiplagged.com, last year, which helped travellers find cheaper flights through this style of ticketing, both United Airlines and Orbitz filed a civil lawsuit.\nIt's also important to note that this strategy only works if you book a one-way flight, have no checked bags, and happen to be heading to a destination that is not a regional airline hub.\n2. Full refunds on flights are possible to redeem\nHave you ever booked a flight months in advance, only to have your flight schedule changed just weeks ahead of your trip?\nAs it turns out, when an airline does that, most are obligated to re-book customers on new flights without any additional fees - and if they newly proposed travel times aren't acceptable, travellers just may be eligible for a full refund.\nKeep in mind, however, that you will likely wind up paying more anyway since fares tend to go up closer to departure meaning that your full refund may not cover the cost of a replacement flight.\nThe cheapest time to buy tickets is on a Tuesday - and ideally, more than 21 days in advance\n3. Compensation owed on delayed bags may be greater than you think\nIn the United States, the Department of Transportation issued a directive to all airlines stating that in the event of lost checked bags - and also delayed bags - that there cannot be 'arbitrary limits' placed on monetary compensation.\nEssentially, this means that while often airlines offer very little in compensation (if any) for delayed bags, or simply hand out a future travel voucher or frequent flyer miles, the maximum liability that you can claimed may actually be as high as $3,300.\nHowever, this particular number does only apply for domestic US travel and the limits on international travel are often less.\nIt's not just American passengers who benefit from compensation. In the EU, you are entitled to a pay-out if your flight is delayed by more than three hours on arrival - if it was the airline's fault.\nAnd don't feel obligated to accept vouchers, you're entitled to the cash, according to EC Regulation 261/2004.\nBut if the disruption was outside of the airline's control, such as bad weather, air traffic control problems or staff strikes, it doesn't have to pay out.\n4. Fly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays\nRecent research from Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) has found that it's best to buy tickets on a Tuesday - and ideally, more than 21 days in advance - to take advantage of the best possible rates.\nBut that doesn't mean those are the best days to take to the skies, according to USA Today's Rick Seaney.\nTuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays tend to be the days when airlines have a greater surplus of seats available - likely because they are the least convenient days when it comes to accommodating work schedules and weekend getaways - and so, offer the cheapest fares.\nSome airlines let you switch the date of your flight by a few weeks, without paying more, so you can secure peak-time flights for off-peak prices\n5. Save hundreds by 'booking the wrong date'\n'EasyJet's Flexifares let you switch the date of your flight by a few weeks, without paying more, Steve Nowottny, consumer and features editor at MoneySavingExpert explains.\n'This offers a sneaky way for you to bag peak-time flights for less.\n'For example, you can buy cheap flights during in-term time, then swap for your chosen school holiday date.\nOf course, it's not fool proof - and you'll need to be careful that the dates will line up correctly to such a plan - but Nowottny insists that some travellers have saved serious amounts using this little-known trick.\n6. Code-share and always check for cheap seats\nThere are plenty of ways to ensure the cheapest possible fare on the flight of your dreams.\n'Sometimes, two or more airlines sell the same flights and booking via one partner is cheaper,' Nowottny tells MailOnline Travel.\n'For example, a United flight from Birmingham to New York can be cheaper via Lufthansa. This can be a good way of flying with well-known airlines for less.'\nThe MoneySavingExpert editor also recommends checking how many cheap seats are left on a flight if you're thinking of booking, but not quite ready to commit just yet.\n'Many airlines let you book seats for up to about nine passengers, so pretend to make the booking for more seats than you need,' he says.\n'If the cheap fare's still available for nine seats, then you've got breathing space. If the fare shoots up after three, four or five seats, you'll need to grab it as soon as possible.'\n7. Whenever possible, use a credit card for your booking\nAlthough plenty of airlines offer incentive for completing a booking on your debit card, it may be wise to pay via credit card instead.\nBob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket advises always paying at least Â£100 of your travel purchase by credit card to give you financial protection in the event of anything going wrong.\nIf that's not possible, using a debit card is still preferable to paying with cash, cheque or bank transfer.\nRead more: Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide | Data | Table Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide | Data | Map Mapped: The world's most frequent fliers - Telegraph", "external_links": ["http://data.worldbank.org/widgets/indicator/0/web_widgets_3/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W", "http://data.worldbank.org/widgets/indicator/0/web_widgets_1/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W?order=wbapi_data_value_2014%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc&display=default", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W?display=map", "http://dailym.ai/1Udp8fY", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W?display=graph", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/11821657/Mapped-The-worlds-most-frequent-fliers.html", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W?order=wbapi_data_value_2014%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc&display=map", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.DPRT/countries/1W?order=wbapi_data_value_2014%20wbapi_data_value%20wbapi_data_value-last&sort=desc&display=graph", "http://data.worldbank.org/profiles/datafinder/modules/contrib/web_widgets/iframe/web_widgets_iframe.js"], "published": "2015-08-27T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:15:54.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
