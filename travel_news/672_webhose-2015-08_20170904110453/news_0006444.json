Sign Up Now! Find your way around Aeroporto Di Firenze \nFlorence Peretola Airport (FLR) is located about 4 kilometers northeast of the center of Florence, Italy. The airport is known by many names, including Florence Peretola Airport or Auroporto Amerigo Vespucci or simply Perotola. It's a small and pretty convenient airport. The airplane icon on the map marks the automobile entrance to Florence Airport. How to Get to and From Florence Airport \nBy car: As you can see on the map, the airport is accessed from the A11/E76 (following signs referencing \"aeroporto\"). Looking at the bottom of the map, the actual entrance to the airport is rather tricky. You see, Viale Giovanni Luder is a one-way street heading west. You'll be dumped off on the Viale degli Astronauti, which parallels the Viale Giovanni Luder, and will make a loop that takes you around and heads you the right way on Viale Alessandro Guidoni, which turns into Viale Giovanni Luder (zoom in to see this on the map). Make absolutely sure you're in the right lane on the three lane Viale Giovanni Luder because that's the only lane that enters the airport, despite what the signs might tell you. If you miss the entrance, you're in for a very long loop back. \nAlong the route to the airport outlined above, there are plenty of gas / petrol stations for you to make that final fill up, including one you can see on the map just before you make the right turn into the entrance to the airport. \nBy bus: Volainbus takes you from the Autostazione Sita near Firenze SMN, Florence's main train station to the airport. Buses leave about every half hour in the peak times. Here is a timetable . \nBy Taxi: Taxis are located outside the Arrivals hall. They are quite a bit more expensive than the SITA bus. \nFor more, see our Florence Transportation Tips . For the current weather and historic climate, see Florence Travel Weather .
