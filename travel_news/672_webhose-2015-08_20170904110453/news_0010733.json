Meanwhile, heat a pan of water that is big enough to hold a lobster or two (you will need to cook them in batches) and add enough salt until the water has the same saltiness as seawater (3 per cent, or 30g per litre). The lobsters will now be very drowsy, so put them straight into the boiling water. Let the water boil for a minute and then turn off the heat. Let the water cool down for at least 30 minutes, then remove the lobsters. • A humane way to cook lobster It’s best to wear a pair of rubber gloves or disposable surgical gloves to remove the meat, as the shell can be sharp. When they are cool enough to handle, pull the tail from the main body and cut through the bands of shell with strong kitchen scissors. Remove the intestine (the black strip at the top of the tail), then extract the meat. Get the meat out of the claws by whacking them with a heavy knife. Place a tea towel over the claws and whack with a heavy knife to crack them open. Remove the meat. You can quickly pan-fry the meat to cook it for a bit longer, if you prefer. Set it aside. Meanwhile, make the salad dressing. Just place all the ingredients in a clean jam jar, screw on the lid and shake well. Set aside. Slice the ceps, or other mushrooms, into half‑centimetre-thick slices. Add a knob of butter to a large frying pan over a medium heat and wait for it to start to foam, then add the cep slices and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they start to turn golden brown. Add a pinch of salt. • Lobster Thermidor recipe Remove from the heat and add a small knob of butter, a squeeze of lemon and the snipped chives. Toss well. To assemble, split the lobster meat between four plates and spoon over the ceps and their juices. Toss the salad leaves in the dressing and serve on the plate or on the side. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T10:01:51.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
