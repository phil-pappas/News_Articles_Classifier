Artist.\"\nBruna, 88, stopped working in 2011, but Miffy remains immensely popular around the world. The Rijksmuseum says it wants to present his work in an art historical context.\nIf you think drawing the rabbit known in the Netherlands as Nijntje is easy, you need to think again, said curator Caro Verbeek.\nTo prove her point, Verbeek had other curators at the museum draw Miffy's head, with its dots for eyes and x shape representing both nose and mouth.\n\"They did not succeed,\" she said. \"It is incredibly difficult. But the fact that it seems so simple proves that he is a true genius and true master who completely controls all lines and colours.\"\nThe exhibition is about more than just Miffy â€” the star of a series of books that has been translated into more than 50 languages and sold millions of copies worldwide. It also showcases Bruna's other work including advertising posters and the book jackets that gave him his start in the art world.\nRunning through them all is the same simplicity and purity of form that Bruna first saw when visiting Parisian museums while on an internship after World War II and seeing work by the likes of Matisse.\n\"They all have those same elements, same use of colour, same use of space as the French avant-garde,\" Verbeek said.\nThe exhibition, which is the Rijksmuseum's way of marking this year's 60th anniversary of Miffy's creation, opened Thursday and runs through Nov. 15.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:21:55.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
