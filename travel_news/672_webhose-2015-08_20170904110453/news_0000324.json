The rise reported by the National Statistics Institute (INE) puts Portugal on track to beat last year's record number of visitors and all-time high revenues.\nTravel-related revenue, which accounts for about 10 percent of Portugal's gross domestic product, has been growing since 2011, helping the country overcome its economic and debt crisis.\nIn the period from January to June, the number of foreign visitors who stayed in Portuguese hotels rose about 9 percent to 4.5 million, including more than a million in June alone, the INE said.\nHotel receipts rose 12 percent in the period to EURâ‚¬1 billion (USD$1.1 billion).\nPortugal has also benefited from a drop in travel to places such as Egypt and Tunisia due to political unrest there.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:15:49.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
