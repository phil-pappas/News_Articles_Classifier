As part of its exclusive partnership with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the leader in car hire services in Europe supplied 49 vehicles for players and officials for this summer’s ATP and WTA professional tennis tournaments across the UK. And a further 11 vehicles were provided in support of the thrilling Davis Cup by BNP Paribas GB v France quarter final at Queens in July. \nThe Europcar LTA fleet included Mercedes C and E class saloons and estates and a convoy of Nissan LEAF electric cars. The tireless assignment saw everyone from Andy Murray to Heather Watson driven to and from matches. An impressive 30,000 miles in total – the equivalent of 100 trips between London and Paris - ensured that players and officials got to where they needed to be in comfort. Europcar also marked its exciting partnership with the LTA with an exclusive interactive event at the AEGON Championships at The Queens Club in June. Visitors were invited to strike a pose in a Europcar branded Mercedes CLS 220. With a range of props available, from sun visors to tennis rackets, fans were invited to get creative and take away four fun images as a souvenir of their day. Plus there was a special competition to win tickets to the Davis Cup quarter final in July, with one lucky couple enjoying the prize of a thrilling day watching the Murray brothers win the doubles match en route to defeat France in the best of five match series. “With over 30,000 miles clocked up by the end of July, it’s safe to say Europcar went the distance for the LTA this summer, explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. “Every player goes on a journey when taking part in the prestigious LTA tournaments; it’s vital, therefore, that the journey to their competition runs as smoothly as possible. And it was especially exciting to be involved in the Davis Cup quarter final where we were able to bring our Nissan LEAF electric fleet, which is perfectly aligned to the Mayor of London’s Electric Vehicle Delivery Plan, into action.” “Europcar’s reputation for premium customer care, combined with quality vehicles, including the latest electric vehicle technology, has made the company the perfect partner for us over the Summer” added James Mercer, the LTA Commercial Director. “Knowing that our transport for players and officials was in safe hands, the LTA team was free to focus on delivering a series of great events for tennis fans.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T12:50:08.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
