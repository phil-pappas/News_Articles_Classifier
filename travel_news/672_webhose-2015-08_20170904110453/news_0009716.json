China now accounts for 20 per cent of all trip spending by international visitors, which incidentally rose to a record $32.5 billion.\nMs Lyn Lewis-Smith said these incentive groups are being sent by global corporations rewarding their top achievers. “They are shopping, they are eating at our restaurants and they are visiting our attractions and cultural icons. They want an immersive experience in our Indigenous culture, they are really inquisitive as to where our heritage comes from.”\nShe said there are a number of things small business owners can do to capitalise on Australia’s popularity.\nSource:- Business Events Sydney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T05:00:10.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
