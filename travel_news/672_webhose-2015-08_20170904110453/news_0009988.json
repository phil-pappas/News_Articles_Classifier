The building exhibits the artistry of pioneering Seattle architect John Graham Sr., who also designed the Dexter Horton Building and the buildings Nordstrom and Macy’s occupy in downtown Seattle.\nDaniels Real Estate’s plan is to revamp empty dorm rooms for a boutique, 100-room hotel at a cost of about $50 million. The firm boasts a strong track record of reviving historic buildings in Seattle: Starbucks Center, King Street Station and Frye Art Museum.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time For the Saint Edward project, the developer agreed to buy the McDonald property, a 10-acre, undeveloped site adjacent to the park, and exchange that land with the state parks department for the seminary building and the 8 acres it sits on. The proposal does not include the grand lawn or nearby playground.\nSaint Edward Park visitors already hike along trails through the McDonald property to access Lake Washington. For more than a decade, the state parks department has sought funding to buy the McDonald property to expand the existing park, but the state Legislature has not granted the request.\nSome nearby residents vehemently oppose allowing private ownership within the park and are concerned that a commercial use, such as a hotel, would take away public access. In 2005, the group Citizens for Saint Edward Park stopped a proposal from McMenamins to convert the seminary building into a hotel and brewpub.\nThat type of obstruction needs to stop. Daniels Real Estate presents an attractive opportunity. The state parks department doesn’t have the $14 million needed to rehabilitate the building and faces a $500 million maintenance backlog for the hundreds of other parks and historic buildings it operates.\nThe seminary must not be allowed to end up like countless other historic treasures regrettably shuttered or torn down.” Seeking a private developer partner was a good strategic move by the state parks department. No money, no restoration.\nThe parks commission should approve a request to give Daniels Real Estate a year to refine its proposal. Details surrounding parking, transfer of ownership and park access could then be hashed out.\nThe seminary must not be allowed to end up like countless other historic treasures regrettably shuttered or torn down. Instead, it should be renovated into the vibrant, majestic structure it deserves to be.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
