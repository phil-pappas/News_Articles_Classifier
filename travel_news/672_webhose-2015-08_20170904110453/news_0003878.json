Trying to keep things simple, I dipped into the part of my brain where I store lists of plants with magical, multiple attributes for non-gardeners, and this is what I have come up with. All are tough, evergreen, not over-fussy about soil and will make a neat 8ft-long hidey-hedge that performs well at around 3ft within a year or three. As with all shrubs, they prefer a reasonable amount of sun. Daphne x transatlantica Eternal Fragrance, rosemary 'Miss Jessopp’s Upright’, Pittosporum tenuifolium 'Irene Paterson’ and a big, bulky lavender 'Grosso’.
