His daughter was having fun swimming, when she suddenly got into difficulty in the water and screamed for help. \nTwo [lifeguards] were at the beach, and they rushed to help the girl. \nHowever, there was one obstacle, which prevented them from reaching the girl and helping her… the belief of this Asian man, who considered that if these men touched his daughter, then this would dishonor her. It cost him the life of his daughter. \nThe father – a tall and strong man – physically prevented the lifeguards from reaching his daughter. \nHe started pulling and [holding back] the [lifeguards] and got violent with them. He told them that he prefers his daughter being dead than being touched by a strange man. \nBy the time the father had stopped fighting with the lifeguards, the young woman's heart had stopped beating. \nThe young woman’s father was later arrested by Dubai police and charged in connection with the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:40:06.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
