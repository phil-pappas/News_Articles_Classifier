In addition to ensuring compliance with the pending ELD mandate, fleets that adopt electronic logs realize benefits including cost reduction, time savings, and efficiency improvements. The new video is live on www.ELDfacts.com , an important online resource established to help carriers better understand and prepare for this regulation, and provides valuable information on the many operational advantages delivered by ELDs.\n\"While many fleets today are looking to ELDs simply as a requirement for compliance with the pending FMCSA mandate, it's critically important that companies are also aware of the many additional ways this technology can improve their business,\" stated Tom Cuthbertson , vice president of regulatory compliance at Omnitracs. \"Both drivers and back-office staff experience time savings, simplification of their work, and increased accuracy of records, all of which can result in cost reductions and improved productivity for the fleet.\"\nThe visually compelling video utilizes whiteboard drawings to illustrate key messages in an easy-to-understand format. Among the ELD benefits-beyond compliance with the FMCSA mandate-noted in the video are:\nCost reduction -fleets no longer need to purchase and store paper logs, fines for violations are reduced, and lost revenue due to out-of-service orders is eliminated Time savings -drivers spend less time maintaining manual records and more time driving, back-office staff spend less time reviewing logs and correcting errors, and managers no longer have to invest significant time keeping up with the nuances of evolving Hours of Service rules Efficiency improvements -fleets report gaining 15 minutes of additional driving time per day as a result of adopting electronic logs; record-keeping errors are eliminated, and drivers and back-office staff can invest more time on revenue-generating tasks The video is second in the creative whiteboard series produced by Omnitracs, and is one of many resources it has developed designed to inform customers and the industry at large of regulatory developments related to ELDs.
