Initially, it was a practice used by goldsmiths and metalworkers to hand-decorate metal items of their day. Items included armory, dinnerware and guns. These techniques advanced to printmaking by using metal plates to create original art. Rembrandt produced over 300 etchings, each one brilliantly translating his remarkable use of light, air and space. Etchings continued to be used by prominent artists such as Picasso, Matisse, Chagall and Rouault. The intrigue of etching original art continues today. Artist David Hunter is a master in etching high detail images into a zinc plate. Meet the artist during his live demonstrations on September 4th through 7th, 2015 at Seaside Art Gallery in Nags Head, NC. Watch as he transforms his free-hand drawings on his etched zinc plates into original works of art. Hunter inks and highlights his drawing on his etched plate, then hand presses it. Each piece is an original work of art. Visitors attending the free demonstrations will have the opportunity to meet and talk with Hunter about his craft and works of art. Hunter can dedicate his art to visitors during the show. David Hunter is a native of Central Florida. He attended the University of South Florida and earned his M.A. in zoology illustrating his master's thesis with detailed pen-and-ink drawings. He then became a research associate in the biology department at the University of Central Florida, and subsequently taught physical science. Hunter participated in art shows while teaching. Finally in 1978, Hunter took a year's leave of absence and became a full-time artist, resigning his teaching post. He participates in art shows and competitions throughout the United States and has an impressive collection of awards and accolades. Hunter's original works of art appear today in galleries throughout North Carolina, the eastern United States, and in the permanent collection of the London Maritime Museum in England.Seaside Art Gallery is family owned and operated, and is located just steps away from the beach in the Gallery Row Arts District in Nags Head, NC.
