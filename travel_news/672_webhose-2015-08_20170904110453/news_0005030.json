It's nice and wooded, kind of secluded, but has the rich scent of the ocean. [The scent] makes the biggest impact after a storm.\"\n\"I enjoy a scenic drive up the coast between Boston and Rockport . Because I do not drive a car I go on 'the drive' taking the MBTA Commuter rail. I love seeing the water from the train window.\"\n\"I like driving in Vermont up by the Canadian border. I almost always see moose there.\"\n\"I like driving through cranberry country. So Middleborough, Lakeville , Carver , or Plymouth .\"\n\" Newport because it has a whole bunch of stores and mansions there. It's really calm and peaceful and has very clean beaches.\"\n \n\nSOURCE Irving Oil\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://irvingoil.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:29:40.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
