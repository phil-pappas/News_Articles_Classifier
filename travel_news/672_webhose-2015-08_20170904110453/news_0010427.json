The survey, conducted in July 2015 , asked over 5,000 Agoda.com customers from around the world which amenities they want in hotel rooms. When asked which they'd rather have for free, travelers prefer Wi-Fi over breakfast, but barely. Wi-Fi got 55% of the vote and breakfast 45%. \"We know both are important to our customers,\" says John Brown , Agoda.com's Chief Operating Officer. \"Most hoteliers understand that, too, and the majority of the properties on Agoda.com offer room rates inclusive of Wi-Fi, breakfast or both,\" he said. Travelers do have a clear preference when it comes to spacious beds, though. When asked whether they'd prefer a bigger bed or a bigger bathroom, 75% picked a bigger bed.
