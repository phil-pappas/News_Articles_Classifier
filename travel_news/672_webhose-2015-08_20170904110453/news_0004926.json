It will be published in print in Saturday's Your Money with a selection of readers' comments, so please have your say below The Budget increased the amount of tax that many investors will pay on their dividends. When he announced the change, the Chancellor airily dismissed the old system as being too complicated. He did not pay regard to what it tried to achieve. Why? The objective of the old rules was to stop shareholders being subjected to double taxation on income. A company pays a dividend from profits that have already been subject to corporation tax and it was thought unfair to make shareholders pay substantial income tax on top. • The new dividend tax: a simple case of double taxation The Chancellor cheerfully argues that he has reduced corporation tax and that the great majority of shareholders will not suffer as they do not receive more than £5,000 of dividend income (the new tax-free allowance) or they hold their shares in an Isa. However, in the next moment the Chancellor announced that the changes to dividend taxation would produce £2bn of extra revenue for the Treasury next year. This money has not been conjured out of nowhere; it will come from savers paying around 7.5pc more on their dividend income. The larger private shareholders of the funds I run will face a bigger tax bill next year. • New dividend tax: how it works – and how to avoid it Does this matter? You may say the shareholders can afford it and the underlying dividend payments are rising, which cushions the blow. The Chancellor has many pressing items of expenditure to fund. Therefore perhaps the best reaction is to think how much worse it could have been had there been a different result in the general election. However, let’s hope that before the next Budget the Chancellor stops and thinks before he decides to further plunder dividend income. Mr Osborne is behaving more like Gordon Brown’s apprentice than the next Conservative prime minister. Mr Brown started the plunder when he was chancellor. Before the Blair government, pension funds and charities were able to use the tax credit on dividend payments to get back the tax paid by companies. Mr Brown took this ability away in stages. His changes increased the tax take by many billions but there has been a huge long-term cost. Britain’s pension funds are now a shadow of their former selves. They are predominantly closed to new members and are often in deficit. Companies have to take money from their current revenues to chip away at putting their pension fund right. The weak state of these funds has meant that they have had to reduce their stock market exposure because they cannot accept the inherent volatility, although the best long-term returns have come from that part of the portfolio. Shares in British companies now form a substantially lower percentage of pension funds’ and charities’ portfolios than 20 years ago. This not only reduces the long-term returns that might be achieved for pensioners but reduces the flow of investment into British industry. • I live off my £20,000 dividends - how much tax will I have to pay? When Mr Brown started changing the system he thought people would not notice as it’s a complicated area. But the cost has been immense and unfortunately Mr Osborne is now continuing Mr Brown’s work. Dividend payments are being attacked not only by the Chancellor but by some commentators who think paying a dividend stops companies investing in their business. I strongly believe that they’re wrong, because for most British companies paying a cash dividend is a healthy discipline. Often a company will behave the way many people do when they have excess cash: they spend it badly. Money is usually best spent when there is a degree of financial tension. Britain’s most successful companies have usually paid a growing dividend over the long term. They have balanced the split between capital investment and dividend payments in the knowledge that cash should always be treated as a precious resource that belongs to their shareholders, even when they are making good profits. What is more, a mismatch has now emerged between taxes paid on capital gains and those paid on dividends, to the detriment of the latter. This undermines the dividend-paying culture of British companies, which has proved to be so beneficial to the long-term providers of capital and to the companies themselves. It’s important that changes to the tax system do not further jeopardise the success of the system; to this end the tax treatment of dividends and capital gains should be equal. • James Henderson, fund manager of Lowland Investment Company and Henderson Opportunities Trust @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:04:27.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
