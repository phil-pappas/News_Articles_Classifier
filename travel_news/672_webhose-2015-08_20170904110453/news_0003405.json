The Department of Tourism continues to work very closely with our tourism partners through marketing and promotional efforts to flatten the seasonality of tourism. We are encouraged by the continued confidence demonstrated by airline partners through the addition of new and expanded winter service from key markets in the US, such as Chicago, Dallas and Washington, D.C.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T08:16:24.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
