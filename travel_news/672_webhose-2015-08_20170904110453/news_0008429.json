But the kung fu masters do not hesitate to punish those who fail to follow instructions to the letter — including by assigning students to clean the gym for a week. — AFP  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:41:09.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
