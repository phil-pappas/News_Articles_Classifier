Olsen crowned ‘Britain’s Best Cruise Line for Food’ Published on : Saturday, August 8, 2015\nFred. Olsen Cruise Lines is delighted to be crowned ‘Britain’s Best Cruise Line for Food’, in the Holiday & Cruise Channel’s prestigious ‘Telly’ Awards, which are voted for entirely by viewers. Fred. Olsen won the accolade by a considerable margin, registering nearly 10,000 votes.\nEvery quarter, the Liverpool-based Holiday & Cruise Channel – which broadcasts on Sky Channel 256 and Freeview Channel 55 – runs a poll on its website, to find out what its viewers think about selected areas of cruising, and the winner wins one of its coveted ‘Telly’ Awards. In the last quarter, the channel asked ‘Who is Britain’s ‘Best Cruise Line for Food’, and Fred. Olsen came out as the resounding winner!\nFred. Olsen offers a range of restaurants and dining experiences across its fleet of four smaller, more intimate ships – Balmoral, Braemar, Boudicca and Black Watch – to suit the tastes and appetites of its predominantly British clientele.\nJohn Cooper, Commercial Director of the Holiday & Cruise Channel, said:\n“Our viewers are a very discerning lot; after all, being the only television channel in the world dedicated to holidays and cruises, they know a thing or two when it comes to what they like.\n“Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines are right to be proud of winning this award. Food is a major part of any cruise experience, and to be voted the best in Britain in the ‘Telly’ Awards is a badge of honour they should wear with pride.”\nDirk Helsig, Corporate Executive Chef for Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said:\n“All the Executive Chefs and their teams are over the moon to have won this award, and we are very proud to work for Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines.\n“Whether they are washing pots or removing garbage, it is a team effort from all the individual Galley staff, but we should also not forget the Restaurant team’s important contribution to this success.\n“We will continue to work with the very best British ingredients to create feasts for all of our guests to enjoy as they take an exciting Fred. Olsen cruise!”\nFred. Olsen’s award-winning cuisine includes hearty cooked breakfasts, fresh fruit, delicious buffets, ‘Traditional Afternoon Tea’ – with white glove service – mouth-watering five-course à la carte menus and speciality grilled meat and seafood dishes in the new Grill restaurants, which have been introduced across the fleet.\nFred. Olsen also offers an array of vegetarian and healthier choices, too, with an emphasis on fish and seafood dishes, inspired by the company’s Norwegian heritage.\nFred. Olsen also caters to vegetarians and those with special dietary requirements. All guests are asked about any special needs when they complete their booking form, so that the Executive Chef and his team are made aware, and they are always happy to discuss menus with these guests while on board.\nFred. Olsen’s team of four Executive Chefs from each ship also shared their views on what makes it such a renowned cruise line for food:\nMartin Grabenhofer, Executive Chef on board Braemar, said:\n“Our guests are our number one priority here at Fred. Olsen. Working together with our friendly and dedicated Restaurant team, we are driven by satisfied customers and positive feedback. With good, honest British ingredients, it is a pleasure to serve high-quality food around the clock and to create mouth-watering dishes ship-wide.\n“We will continue to do our utmost to work as a team and provide an award-winning culinary experience across the fleet.”\nMathieu Loos, Executive Chef on board Black Watch, said:\n“We are honoured to receive this accolade, voted for by our distinguished guests. Through our passion for fine cuisine and hard work, we have set a standard for others to follow. Using mostly British produce and ingredients, we pride ourselves on giving guests a taste of the ‘Best of Britain’, and to create a tantalizing culinary experience on every voyage, to every corner of the globe.\n“Thank you to all who have voted for us and may you experience more culinary delights on your next Fred. Olsen voyage.”\nAlain Henry, Executive Chef on board Balmoral, said:\n“As proud members of the Galley team, it is encouraging to receive this award, as it means that our guests are recognising the considerable efforts of all the chefs, cooks and utility staff across the fleet.\n“We are committed to providing the best variety and quality of cuisine that we can. We will continue to do our very best in the Galley to provide an exceptional culinary experience, in keeping with the Fred. Olsen philosophy.”\nSara Sipek, Executive Chef on board Boudicca, said:\n“We are humbled and excited to have won this award. We could not achieve this without the loyal Galley crew members across the fleet, some of whom have worked at Fred. Olsen for many years.\n“It is an incredible honour to be a part of this team; we are proud to work for this company, and we would like to thank all the public who voted for us.”\nFred. Olsen offers more regional UK departures than any other cruise line, sailing from ten convenient ports in 2015: Southampton, Dover, Harwich, Tilbury, Avonmouth (Bristol), Liverpool, Newcastle, Greenock (Glasgow), Rosyth (Edinburgh) and Belfast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T13:51:29.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
