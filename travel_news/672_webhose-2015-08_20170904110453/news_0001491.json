The delays at the second-tier Shenzhen airport since the second half of 2014 have led to several serious incidents, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a rare rebuke.\nDelays at the airport have triggered four major incidents in May alone, the CAAC said.\nPassengers for a delayed flight, operated by Shenzhen Airlines, arrived on the tarmac in front of the plane before the crew got there, while passengers on a China United Airlines flight opened an emergency door after waiting on board for four hours on another delayed flight.\nAn executive with Shenzhen Airport's board secretary office declined to comment.\nChina's aviation sector has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by demand from the country's increasingly wealthy middle class. Outbound passenger volumes rose 39 percent year-on-year in January-May this year after topping 100 million for the first time in 2014.\nBut its airports have been plagued by delays, and incidents involving unruly passengers are on the rise.\nThe country will invest CNY500 billion yuan (USD$80 billion) on 193 major domestic aviation projects this year, the CAAC has said, to alleviate the congestion.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:29:20.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
