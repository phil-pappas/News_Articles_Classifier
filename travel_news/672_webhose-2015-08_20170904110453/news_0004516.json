You may be like me, and have to cull your growing collection every so often. But one thermos that’s at the front of my home pack is the CamelBak Forge . \nWhy keep your merely “acceptable” hot beverage containers when you can get one that doesn’t leak, is easy to clean, and keeps the hot stuff really hot? \nTo start with, the cap has a few features that will make you happy. Whether we’re talking about coffee, tea, or chai, you don’t want your preferred hot beverage leaving all over your car, backpack, or desk. The leak-proof cap is self-sealing, and works even when you’re not particularly careful and toss the Forge into your car’s back seat. If you happen to be a frequent sipper, like on those occasions when your coffee is particularly luscious or you’re just desperate for a quick wake-up, you can lock that cap open for sipping ease. \nIt can be hard to determine the temperature of your drink when it’s been locked away in a thermos, so the “aroma bowl” is built into the cap for a way to get a safe idea without burning your tongue. The cap arms are also designed to flip up, so it’s easy to clean the leftovers from past beverages. Clean it in the sink or dishwasher—both work fine. \nThe insulation of the Forge is double walled, meaning your drink stays hotter, longer. I can’t count the times I’ve reached for my thermos on my desk, thinking I needed to make more tea, and realized that even three hours later, my existing beverage was still hot. CamelBak says that your drink will stay hot for 4.5 hours. \nWhen you’re distracted and carrying too much, or simply have butterfingers, the impact-resistant cap helps minimize breaks if (or when) you drop the Forge. \nAnd think about all the disposable cups you’ve used in the past year. You’re saving both money and the planet by finding one dedicated thermos for your hot drinks. \nThe CamelBak Forge 16-ounce thermos is available in black smoke, blue steel (think it’s a Zoolander reference?), ghost berry, olive sky and midnight lilac, all on the CamelBak site for $30. There’s a smaller, 12-ounce size for $29. The Forge is also available at Amazon .
