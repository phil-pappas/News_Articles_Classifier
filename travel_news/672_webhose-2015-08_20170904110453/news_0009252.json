He said the mission had strengthened bilateral ties.\n“NSW showcased its excellence in food and wine at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Food Expo and Gala Dinner, which put our best producers and exporters in direct contact with local traders,” Mr Ayres said.\n“We launched Australia’s Oyster Coast to the Chinese market in Guangzhou. Now, Chinese seafood lovers can savour fresh NSW oysters within 30 hours of harvest.”\nMr Ayres also led a delegation of 10 education technology start-ups that travelled to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing to showcase NSW’s innovative education solutions to potential Chinese partners and investors. This resulted in two Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) between NSW company Inkerz and Chinese companies Shenzhen Yifang Digital Technology and Shijiazhuang Dazhong Network Communication to promote and distribute Inkerz products.\nA significant two-year agreement was reached between the NSW Government and Ctrip, China’s largest online travel agency. An MOU was signed which will deliver more marketing and promotional opportunities for Sydney and regional NSW.\nNSW will now export an additional $4 million worth of wine to China – including the first export of certified organic wine from NSW – alongside natural oats, baby formula, vitamins and other health products. Health and aged care, issues highlighted in the recent China-Australia Free Trade Agreement (ChAFTA), were also raised in a number of meetings.\n“The growing middle class and ageing population in China will create opportunities for NSW health and aged care businesses. These are high on the agenda for the NSW Government and we are committed to supporting and fostering continual growth in these areas as well as in the State’s export sector,” Mr Ayres added.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:32:29.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
