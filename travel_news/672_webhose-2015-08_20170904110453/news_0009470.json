According to the HAS midyear report, George Bush Intercontinental Airport has seen a significant increase in both international and domestic travelers since January. International travel in the first half of 2015 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the same period last year. More than 5.1 million international passengers caught flights out of IAH. The airport estimated that at the current rate it could see nearly 10.2 million international passengers by the end of the year. Domestic travel is up at IAH by 3.5 percent year over year, with 15.8 million passengers coming through IAH to reach other U.S. cities. Last year, this number grew only by 2 percent. Overall, IAH saw a 3.6 growth in its travel rates compared to the same period as last year, with more than 20.89 million passengers traveling through the airport. It's no surprise that IAH has seen an increase in traffic lately. Domestic airlines have also flocked to IAH, including Frontier Airlines, which announced nonstop flights to Las Vegas last month . Meanwhile, William P. Hobby Airport's numbers, which have increased 34 percent over the past 10 years, have begun to level off. Domestic rates dropped by 1.9 percent from the same time period as last year, coming in at a total of 5.7 million passengers. However, HAS predicted that the nine new international flights, operated by Southwest Airlines , that will take off out of Hobby later this year will help bolster those numbers. HAS said that the midyear pace would push the 2015 passenger totals past last year’s record-setting number, when it saw more than 53.1 million passengers travel through its two commercial airports. \nWant Houston Travel news in your inbox?
