The 92,000-acre park ranges between 2,300 feet on the west side of the part to 8,482 feet at the summit of Rincon Peak on the east side. Thanks to such an extreme elevation, Saguaro National Park is home to more than 1,700 species of plants and animals, making it one of the most biologically diverse parks in the country. \nHikers appreciate the miles of trails, most of which are open to equestrians. Each district has its own visitor center, where guests can learn about the park's plants and animals, geology and archaeology, ranger-led events and interpretive activities. The busy season at Saguaro runs from about November through mid-April. During that time, rangers and volunteers present a number of interpretive programs each day. \nDetails: Cactus Forest Drive, Tucson, 520-733-5158, www.nps.gov/sagu , $ \nSabino Canyon \nSabino Canyon cuts a scenic cleft into the Santa Catalina Mountains.

The 3.8-mile paved road into the canyon is closed to vehicles, but from the visitor center, you can walk along the road, hike one of the trails or ride the shuttle to the trailhead. \nAt the end of the road (shuttle stop 9), the Sabino Canyon Trail climbs 2.5 miles in a series of moderate switchbacks to meet the Phoneline Trail. Turn left, continuing up canyon. The trail contours the hillside, staying high above the creek. After a mile or so, it drops into Sabino Basin. \nTurn left onto the West Fork Trail. You'll cross a big wash flowing from Box Camp Canyon, meander through grassy hills and then wind along the banks of West Fork. Look for a cairned, well-used path to the right leading down to the creek. Hutch's Pool is a long, slender pool sheltered in a sheer rock gorge. Even when it's too chilly to swim, this is an idyllic spot for a lunch break. It makes a good turnaround spot as well. \nDetails: 5900 N.
