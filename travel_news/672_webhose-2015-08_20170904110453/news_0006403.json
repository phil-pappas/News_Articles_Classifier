But Jon Krakauer says the ill-fated 1996 Mount Everest expedition he joined as a writer for Outside magazine was the \"biggest mistake\" of his life. \"I wish I'd never gone,\" he told HuffPost Live last week. \"I suffered for years with (post-traumatic stress disorder), still suffer from what happened. I'm glad I wrote a book about it, but you know, if I could go back and relive my life, I never would have climbed Everest.\" Four members of Krakauer's expedition, along with several climbers from other groups, died in May 1996 after a severe storm roared over the world's highest peak. He wrote about the expedition first in Outside and then in his 1999 book. China: Everest shifted 3 centimeters after Nepal quake but remains same height Krakauer offered up the admission in response to 11-year-old Tyler Armstrong , who said he is hoping to climb the tallest peaks on each continent -- he's so far done three -- and asked for advice on climbing Everest. Krakauer said Everest is unlike any other mountain, one unusually dangerous even for a sport synonymous with danger and difficulty. \"I'm the last person should tell people not to do crazy s**t, but think twice about it,\" he said.
