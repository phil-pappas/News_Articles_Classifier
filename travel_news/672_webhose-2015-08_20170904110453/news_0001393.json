The hypersonic jet. Source: YouTube \nAIRBUS has designed a “rollercoaster-plane” that could dramatically reduce the amount of time we have to spend crammed into those uncomfortable airline seats. But it’s not for the faint-hearted. \nThe aviation giant’s patent for the hypersonic plane, which it calls a “ultra-rapid air vehicle and related method of aerial locomotion”, has been given the tick of approval by the US Patent and Trademark Office . \nThe new aircraft would be capable of flying at four-and-a-half times the speed of sound (Mach 4.5). \nReaching speeds of more than 4800 kilometres per hour, that would be more than twice as fast as the Concorde, which was capable of flying at 2100km/h. \nAirbus hopes to blast the Concorde record sky-high by incorporating turbojets, a rocket motor and a hydrogen power system into its new aircraft. The patent for the new airliner.

It could also cut flight times between Paris and San Francisco, or Tokyo and Los Angeles, to just three hours. Rocket engine engaged.

But once it has climbed enough, the turbojets would retract and the rocket engine would be ignited at full force, causing the plane to travel vertically, Mr Gupta explains. Woah.

It claims the design will mean the sonic boom from the jet won’t reach the ground. Hyersonic plane \nWhile it’s yet to see if this plane will become a reality, the ideas could help transform modern aviation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T06:27:57.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
