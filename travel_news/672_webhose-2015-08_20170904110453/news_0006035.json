For many applications, particularly high-mileage fleet operators and consumers in regions with high retail prices for liquid fuels, natural gas (NG) can provide an excellent option for reducing both operating costs and CO2 emissions.\nHowever, a number of factors could hinder the near-term growth prospects for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) in several regions. For instance, political tensions in Eastern Europe could affect the supply and prices of gas exports from Russia to Western Europe . Still, demand for NGVs is expected to continue growing worldwide, particularly in developing markets where air pollution has already become a serious issue. NG extraction is now at record levels, and production from non-traditional sources, including hydraulic fracturing of shale gas, is expected to continue increasing through the remainder of this decade. According to Navigant Research, global annual NGV sales are expected to grow from 2.5 million vehicles in 2014 to 4.3 million in 2024.\nThis Navigant Research report examines the global market for NGVs, with a focus on passenger cars, light duty trucks, medium/heavy duty trucks and buses, and commercial vehicles. The study provides an analysis of the key factors expected to influence demand for NGVs, including economic growth, fuel prices, infrastructure availability, acquisition costs, regulations, and technical issues. Global market forecasts for vehicle sales, vehicles on the road, refueling stations, NG consumption, and CNG cylinders, broken down by vehicle segment and region, extend through 2024. The study also analyzes how the market and technology issues will affect automobile and truck manufacturers, suppliers of NG engines, fuel storage, and delivery hardware, and the companies that convert liquid-fueled vehicles to NG.\nKey Questions Addressed:\nHow big is the market for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) both globally and regionally?\nWhich vehicle segments have the greatest potential for demand growth?\nWhat are the key forces driving demand for NGVs?\nWhat are the pros and cons of NGVs in different segments and regions?\nWhich companies are most likely to push the NGV market forward and why?\nWho needs this report?\nAutomobile, truck, and bus OEMs\nNatural gas vehicle (NGV) component and system suppliers\nTier One and aftermarket NGV conversion companies\nCompressed and liquefied natural gas distributors and infrastructure providers\nFleet operators\nGovernment regulators\nInvestor community\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p02788934-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution that finds, filters and organizes the latest industry data so you get all the market research you need - instantly, in one place.\nhttp://www.reportlinker.com", "external_links": ["http://www.reportlinker.com/", "http://www.reportlinker.com/p02788934-summary/view-report.html"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:13:54.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
