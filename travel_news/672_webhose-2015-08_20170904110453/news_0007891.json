Ned Black and Monica Milstein of Mill Valley in the Upper Svaneti... \nMassive blazes across dry West drain firefighting resources Page 1 of 1 \nWhy I went: A National Geographic article on the horses, history and remoteness of this region, and the chapters on Georgia in John Steinbeck ’s 1948 “A Russian Journal” intrigued us. \nDon’t miss: The Svaneti region in the Caucasus Mountains has stunning valleys, peaks and glaciers. The 1,000-year-old cave monasteries at Davit Gareja and Vardzia are fascinating. \nDon’t bother: Trying to pay with a credit card. Most places take cash only. ATMs are available in the cities. \nCoolest souvenir: Exquisite cloisonne pendants made by Orthodox monks sold at Pokany shop in old town Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. \nWorth a splurge: Private guides. Trail markers are not maintained, and historical sites have few explanatory signs. At Davit Gareja you would not know to climb over a ridge to see frescoes undamaged by the Soviets. \nWish I’d packed: A small, unobtrusive hat. Georgians rarely wear hats, and my large hiking hat stuck out like a billboard. \nOther comments: Many conquerors have come through Georgia, so its history is very diverse. Take a Russian phrasebook. Georgian ones aren’t available, and most people speak Russian. Georgians seldom smile but are very helpful and glad you’ve come to visit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T19:39:19.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
