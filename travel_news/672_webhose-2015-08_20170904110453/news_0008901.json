Solar-powered navigation warning lights will be perched atop the five 20-by-20-foot concrete columns that eventually will be reused for Pier Park. \nThere will be no blasting. Some debris will be taken by truck or barge to Albert Whitted Airport for shoreline stabilization. Construction barges will be prohibited from working or anchoring within 20 feet of existing seagrass beds. \nLorraine Margeson, an environmentalist who had fought to save the pyramid, now accepts its fate. \n\"I have accepted that this was going to happen; I have accepted that little old me could not have stopped this,\" she said. \nFurthermore, as a bird monitor for a construction project in Hillsborough Bay over the past two years, Margeson said she has come to respect the corps' rigorous protocols for protecting the environment. \n\"I feel comfortable with the federal oversight,\" she said. \nA farewell of sorts is being planned for the controversial pyramid designed by the late William B. Harvard Sr., an award-winning architect. \nKirby said the mayor will host a community event that \"will honor and best memorialize\" the structure but said he had no details of the event that will likely take place near the Pier. \nPlans to tear down the structure began in earnest July 9 after the City Council approved $5.2 million for initial work on the new Pier Park project. A construction fence quickly went up, but the corps said the city needed a permit to tear down the entire structure -- including the inverted pyramid -- because it sits in navigable waters. The city had asserted it didn't require a permit to demolish the pyramid. \nThe corps also said a permit could not be issued before a memorandum of agreement concerning historic preservation had been signed by the corps, the city and the state historic preservation office. \nAs part of that agreement, the city is required to document, with drawings and photographs, what is referred to as the St. Petersburg Municipal Pier District. Copies will be filed with the state, National Park Service and the St. Petersburg Museum of History. The city also will have to create a heritage marker at the Pier's approach and install an exhibit at the St. Petersburg Museum of History \"depicting the history of structures previously located at the pier site.\" \nNone of that will likely appease those who oppose the new project. \n\"It is common sense that we should know exactly what will be built there before we tear down what is already there,\" said Bud Risser, a Concerned Citizens leader. \nCouncil member Wengay Newton, who favored designs that saved the pyramid, said he is unnerved by the looming demolition. \n\"I'm a bit leery,\" he said. \"Once you tear down what you got, there is no going back.\" \nContact Waveney Ann Moore at wmoore@tampabay.com or (727) 892-2283.
