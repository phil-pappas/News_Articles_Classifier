Kallman currently represents three of the world's most influential maritime, defense and security industry trade shows, including PACIFIC 2015. \nDimdex 2016 will be held March 29 through 31, 2016 at the Qatar National Convention Center in Doha. The U.S. International Pavilion will encompass 1,230 sqm of space in Hall 6, a prime location for visitor traffic and attention. \n\"Now in its fifth edition, Dimdex has grown to become one of most important events in the maritime industry because of its proven ability to draw hands-on buyers with budget and decision-making authority from the MENA region and around the world,\" said Kallman Worldwide President and CEO, Tom Kallman. \"We are proud to have been asked to represent this business opportunity to our nation's maritime equipment, product and service providers, and look forward to helping them grow their share of the regional and global marketplace at Dimdex 2016.\" \nIn 2014, more than 13,000 trade visitors, including 82 delegations from 58 countries, attended Dimdex. More than 190 exhibitors from 30 countries announced some $23 billion in deals. As the region establishes itself as a global cargo hub, show organizers are anticipating more visitors and exhibitors to compete for corresponding defense and security infrastructure and equipment contracts. \n\"Over the past 10 years, Dimdex has established itself as one of the world's major meeting places for maritime, defense and security leaders,\" said Kallman. \"We are confident that the addition of the U.S. International Pavilion organized by Kallman Worldwide will ensure increased U.S. participation at Dimdex 2016, and heightened interest in U.S. exhibitors among show attendees.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:30:42.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
