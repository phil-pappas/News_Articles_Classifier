On our latest family trip, I got to stay at the Polynesian Village Resort at Disney World, the Legoland Hotel, and the Cabana Bay Beach Resort at Universal Orlando.\nThe Polynesian was a nice place to stay. They had a really fun pool. I liked the waterfall, the water slide and the water play area. It was really cool how they had two bathrooms in the room, so I didn't have to wait when Mom was taking a shower. The cable stations on the TV included all the channels I like to watch, so that helped when it was time to relax in the room. I heard there used to be an arcade at this resort, but they took it out in the remodeling, which I consider a rookie mistake. It would have added another fun activity for kids if it was still there. For kids who need to use Disney transportation to get around the parks, it's pretty cool that the monorail comes right to the resort, or you can take a boat.\nThe Legoland Hotel is like no other hotel I've stayed in before. I thought the kids' bunk area in the room was really fun. It was really cool how the trundle bed pulled out from the bottom bunk. All the Lego structures in the room and throughout the hotel were pretty amazing, and I had fun doing a scavenger hunt in the room to solve the puzzle to open a treasure chest filled with Lego gifts for me to keep. I also enjoyed taking a Lego model building class, and a lot of kids looked like they were having fun with the activities at the castle play area. The food was really good, and there was a special buffet area just for kids. The hotel is right next to the Legoland entrance, and it was nice to be so close to the park when we were ready to call it a day.\nThe last hotel was Cabana Bay. I really liked that they have two different pools. I only had time to check out the Lazy River Pool, but the Water Slide Pool looked like a lot of fun. The gift shop had a great selection of stuff from the parks, and I enjoyed shopping there. They had a really cool arcade there, too, and the bowling alley looked pretty awesome. The diner at this hotel has a good selection of different food, and I really liked the fries.\nJoel James, 12-year-old middle schooler and occasional child travel reviewer, tests out the buoyancy of the floating Lego bricks in the pool at the new Florida Legoland Hotel. (Photo: Bobbi James)\nI'd say, you can't really go wrong if you stay at any of these new hotels.\nCoziest room\n1. Legoland Hotel — the blankets were thick and soft, the bunk beds were very cozy, and it had all the great kids' TV channels that I like.\n2. Polynesian Villas — the soft chairs in the room and the big robes in the closet were nice. I liked the two bathrooms, and the TV offerings there were really good, too.\n3. Cabana Bay — The beds were comfy, but the pillows weren't the softest, and it wasn't as interesting as the others. It also didn't have any of the Disney channels on TV like the Polynesian and Legoland did.\nYummiest food\n1. Legoland Hotel — they had delicious waffle fries and dinner rolls, and I loved the chocolate muffins at breakfast. I'm not much of an ice cream eater, but they did have a make-your-own sundae bar at dinner every night.\n2. Cabana Bay — the fries were really good with some special kind of seasoning, and there was a vending machine right next to our room. At breakfast, they have croissants, one of my favorites!\n3. Polynesian Villas — the fries at the Kona Cafe were pretty good, and if you like soft serve (which I don't) they have Dole Whip at the Pineapple Lanai right by the pool.\nFunnest pool\n1. Cabana Bay — They have two really fun pools. The one by our room had a lazy river that was pretty awesome, and the other one had a cool water slide. They also had movies by the Lazy River pool every night.\n2. Polynesian Villas — They're a really close second. They had a water slide, a waterfall and a water play area with slides, dump buckets and water jets. It was really cool to see the fireworks over the castle right from the pool.\n3. Legoland — The pool didn't have anything extravagant. It was just like a regular pool, but the Lego bricks in the pool made it more fun.\nCoolest in-room amenities\n1. Legoland Hotel — I liked how there were three beds for me to choose from, two bunks and a trundle bed. I really like the free Lego sets that they gave me, and I just needed to answer some simple questions and solve a puzzle to unlock the treasure chest they were in.\n2. Polynesian Villas — This room had multiple beds, the sofa bed and the pull down bed under the TV.\n3. Cabana Bay — It didn't really have anything special, just the decorations were kind of cool.\nAwesomest on-site kids' activities\n1. Legoland Hotel — I could build with Legos all over the lobby. I took a Lego building class where I got to build and keep an alien and an alien dog. They had grownups in costumes playing games with kids in the lobby.\n2. Cabana Bay — They had a bowling alley, an awesome arcade and a really big gift shop with lots of stuff from the parks.\n3. Polynesian Villas — They had a cool store and a TV in the lobby to watch while Mom and Dad were checking in. They had movies on the beach and a kids' club, which looked pretty fun.\n18 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1EoAz2G TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3188f373cd56bc50077fcc903e7ccaebd97c0aca/c=0-0-1536-2048&r=183&c=0-0-180-238/local/-/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763337563511122-01545659edcf7473eaed89aacd9c034ae1c9c58a15.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EoAz2G&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EoAz2G&text=Orlando%20hotels%3A%20From%20a%20young%20traveler%27s%20perspective&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1EoAz2G", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763337563511122-01545659edcf7473eaed89aacd9c034ae1c9c58a15.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763334616340230-01da08be41a65f1de8a181c7d9c6a45a8bef701867.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a8367e43d5e247b2d92869ab22245a8df78f905/c=0-0-1536-2048&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/08/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635763334616340230-01da08be41a65f1de8a181c7d9c6a45a8bef701867.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-28T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T17:14:39.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
