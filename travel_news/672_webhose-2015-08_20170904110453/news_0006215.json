First of all, the youngsters had to take up some 60 tonnes of concrete before putting in new paths using a mixture of gravel and sand which is in keeping with the park’s status as a listed garden. They relaid more than 170 metres of paths in this way. In addition to this, the work camp participants attached plaques to more than 280 trees in the park so that they could be recorded in a tree register. Vistas were also reinstated and rubbish was cleared out of the park’s moat, which is currently dry. The youngsters also logged the type of flora in the park’s grassy areas.\nSource:- FBB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:25:19.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
