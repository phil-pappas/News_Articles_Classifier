How will this affect the estimated $1.2 billion worth of trade opportunities with the U.S, particularly in the ag sector? \nAlina Fernandez, daughter of Fidel Castro, Cuba's leader for nearly 50 years, will begin to answer this question during her keynote address at the 10th annual Oilseed & Grain Trade Summit, which will be held next month in Minneapolis, Minn. In her presentation \"Unique Perspective on Cuba by Fidel Castro's Daughter\" on Wednesday, September 30 at 5:30 p.m., Fernandez will share insight on her very unique relationship with Cuba, the changes the nation has undergone in the past few decades, and the economic opportunities that lie ahead. \nA strong advocate of her uncle Raul Castro's regime, Fernandez will highlight the positive economic, political and agricultural changes in Cuba since his reign of power began in 2008. This includes presenting the details of the current agricultural relationship between the U.S. and Cuba, and what post-embargo Cuba might look like for U.S. agriculture. \nDuring subsequent sessions on Thursday, October 1, a group of agricultural experts on Cuba will elaborate on the potential impacts of a lifting of the trade embargo, outlining the specific opportunities and challenges that improved relations will present for the oilseed and grains sectors. \nThis panel discussion, \"Capturing the Market Opportunity in Cuba and the Caribbean Basin\" will bring to the forefront the plausible implications of this historic shift in diplomatic relations and feature leading experts in the field, including: \n• Ron Gray, past chairman (2015), U.S. Grains Council \n• Bill Messina, agricultural economist, University of Florida \n• Thomas Marten, manager, Stark County Farm Bureau of Illinois \nThe Oilseed & Grain Trade Summit is the premier annual event providing actionable content and networking opportunities for key decision makers in the global oilseed (soybeans, canola/rapeseed, sunflower seed and oil palm) and feed grain (corn, wheat, sorghum and barley) value chains. \nHosted by HighQuest Group, the 2015 Summit will be held at the Hyatt Regency Minneapolis, September 30-October 2, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:39:01.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
