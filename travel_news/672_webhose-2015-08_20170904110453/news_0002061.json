Picture: AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky Source: AP \nINVESTIGATORS probing the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine last year said they have identified pieces that “possibly” come from a Russian-made BUK missile at the crash site. \nThe revelation of the find of the Russian-made armament brings the investigation a step closer to laying blame for the shooting down of the passenger aircraft a year ago with the deaths of 298 passengers and crew including 38 Australian citizens and residents. \nIn a joint statement issued by the Dutch Safety Board looking into the crash and the multinational police force in the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) mounting a criminal case, the groups confirmed the BUK missile parts were secured during a recent recovery mission to the crash site in Eastern Ukraine. Investigation ... air base Gilze-Rijen in Holland near the German border where pieces of MH17 are being reassembled.

The JIT will internationally enlist the help of experts, among other forensic specialists and weapon-experts. “ \nBut the spokesman added: “At present the conclusion cannot be drawn that there is a causal connection between the discovered parts and the crash of flight MH17.” \nIt had been widely suspected a BUK missile ground-to-air missile had been used to bring down the Boeing commercial airliner last July but it may never be known who fired it.
