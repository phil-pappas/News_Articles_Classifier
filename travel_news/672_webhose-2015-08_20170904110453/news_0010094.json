If not, you're in the minority. \nNew research from Prudential has revealed that 90 per cent of people over-55 have a bucket list. \nChristopher Peterson, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan suggests that a bucket list is \"an attempt to make life memorable\". He references Daniel Kahneman 's 'peak-end' rule, which states that people judge their experiences based on how they were at their 'peak' and at their end. \n\"Bucket lists, if accomplished, set memories in place that structure life as remembered. It can also be an attempt to make life meaningful, depending of course on the specific items. These lists contain items that would connect people to something larger than themselves.\" \nIn an effort to separate fact from fiction, Prudential surveyed over 1000 adults to find out what the most desirable bucket list activities are. \nUnsurprisingly, travelling dominated the bucket list for many of the people surveyed - accounting for seven of the top 10 most popular activities, with many also reporting they would like to learn a new language or write a book. Here we present the ultimate bucket list 1. Seeing the Northern Lights \nIs seeing the Northern Lights at the top of your list? Photo: Rex \nCatching a glimpse of the aurora borealis, commonly known as the Northern Lights , topped the list, with 38 per cent of people saying they would like to see it in their lifetime. \nConsidered one of nature's most stunning displays, this ethereal, multicoloured show which lights up the night sky most commonly occurs in the Arctic region. The Telegraph's Nigel Tisdall recommends taking a winter break to Iceland or northern Scandinavia to witness the display. 2. Research a family tree \nIn the age of social media, reconnecting with your family has never been easier. \n185 people said researching their family tree or getting in touch with a long-lost relative was on their bucket list. Websites that provide DNA ancestry tests are becoming more commonplace , though scientists have warned that often these are no more than \"genetic astrology\". 3. Drive Route 66 \nThis 51 hour stretch of road is incredibly popular Photo: Julian Simmonds \n13 per cent of people said they'd like to ride down the historic stretch of land that connects Chicago to California. Immortalised in film, novels , and songs, Route 66 is, arguably, the best known of all America's highways. \nBuilt in the Twenties to connect the two states, Route 66 spans 3,305 miles and would take 51 hours of driving time to complete. Along the route you'll find numerous hotels, restaurants, caf√©s, and sight-seeing musts, making Route 66 the perfect destination for a classic American road trip. 4. Learn a language \nWith The Colour Report revealing that 12 per cent of us wish to learn a new language in retirement, it isn't surprising to learn the task also ranks highly in many bucket lists. \nMany choose to learn a second, or third, language in their retirement because it keeps the brain healthy. A Penn State University study revealed that learning a second language increases the efficiency in which information is trasnfffered from one area to the next. 5. Eat in a Michelin starred restaurant \nBarrafina earned its Michelin star in September Photo: Rii Schroer \nJust over 100 people surveyed said eating in a Michelin starred restaurant was on their bucket list and, with 151 restaurants in the UK, this may be one of the easier tasks to tick off your list. \nLast year 14 UK restaurants were awarded a single Michelin star , including Barrafina , Star Inn , the Treby Arms , and Gymkhana . 6. Live in another country \nEach year more of us being to tire of the temperamental British weather and look across the seas for a better, sunnier, later life. \nThe research from Prudential found that 10 per cent of us would like to live abroad at some point in our life and, in 2013, it was found that the number of future retirees aged between 45 and 64 who would consider purchasing a home overseas rose by 38 per cent. 7. Travel on the Orient Express \nPhoto: Film Stills \nCreated at a time where restaurant cars were still relatively new in Europe, the Orient Express quickly impressed rich and famous travellers all over the world. Leopold II of Belgium, Trotsky, Lawrence of Arabia, and even the fictional Hercule Poirot and James Bond were all known as passengers on what became nicknamed, 'The Train of Kings'. \nThe original train ceased operation in 2009 (with local authorities planning to refit it to make it available for tourist use in the future), but those eager to ride on it can board the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express , a private luxury train service from London to Venice that takes its name from the original. 8. Swim with dolphins \nDespite researching suggesting that swimming in dolphins traumatises them , 12 per cent of people surveyed said the activity was on their bucket list. \nResearchers from Newcastle University said that human interaction with dolphins is \"akin to harassment\" and prevents them from resting, feeding, and nuturing their young. 9. Visit at least one of the Seven Wonders of the World \nThe Great Pyramid at Giza and The Great Sphinx Photo: Alamy \nThe classic list of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is a collection of remarkable construction located in the Eastern Mediterranean. \nThe Great Pyramid of Giza (built between 2584 BC and 2561) is the only surviving ancient wonder, boasting several small tombs, temples and The Great Sphinx. More modern 'wonders' include The Grand Canyon, Mount Everest, Victoria Falls, and the Puerto Princesa Underground River \nOver 200 people in the survey said they wanted to visit at least one of these destinations in their lifetime. 10. Retire \nWith life expectancy rising each year and experts warning future generations could be working till they're 100 , for some retirement may seem like a pipedream. \n14 per cent of those surveyed put 'retirement' on their bucket list, a figure that doesn't surprise Prudential: \"When compared with responses to previous research, one in 10 of those who had planned to retire in 2015 said they'd now have to stay at work until they're over 71 years old before they could afford to give up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:46:06.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
