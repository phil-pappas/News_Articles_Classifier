Founded by Marine Corps veteran Sean Gobin after hiking all 2,185 miles of the Appalachian Trail, Warrior Expeditions provides veterans with the equipment and supplies needed to complete long-distance journeys along six National Scenic Trails and the Mississippi River.\nAccording to a report by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, over 2.7 million veterans have returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan and over 20% suffer from post-traumatic stress. To address this problem, Warrior Expeditions provides combat veterans the opportunity to transition from their wartime experiences in the solitude of nature while in the company of other veterans who understand how difficult reintegrating into civilian life can be.\n\"Warrior Expeditions' biggest challenge has been finding an effective and efficient way to travel across the country to support veterans participating in our program. Previously, we used a donated military truck that was converted into an RV with limited success. Now with a new 2014 Winnebago Travato, we are able to travel all over the United States completely self-sustained, which will save our organization thousands of dollars in travel expenses each year, \" Warrior Expeditions CEO Sean Gobin explains.\nWarrior Expeditions is an all-volunteer organization that operates with less than 1% in overhead expenses, ensuring that the majority of donations go directly toward supporting combat veterans on their expeditions. The Winnebago Travato is equipped to carry Warrior Expedition veterans and staff members-including all of their gear-to trailhead and waterway destination points.\nArrow Land Group , Heroes Crossfit and Idle Vine Brewery are Cedar Park, Texas companies that support veteran initiatives.
