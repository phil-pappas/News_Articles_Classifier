The storm's winds peaked Monday at 180 miles per hour, making it the strongest typhoon so far this year, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Winds on Wednesday were churning at 115 mph. The storm is forecast to strengthen again before making landfall and will likely be the equivalent of a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane when it hits Taiwan. Current projections put it over the island early Saturday morning local time, before moving on to mainland China on Saturday night. The West Pacific Basin has seen a total of 10 typhoons so far in 2015. Of those, five have been super typhoons, which is more than the average for the whole year. A typhoon becomes a super typhoon when it has winds equal to or greater than 150 mph. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Weather", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:59:09.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
