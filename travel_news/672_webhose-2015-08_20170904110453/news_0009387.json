Whether it is to one of our numerous campgrounds, a couple of nights' stay at a resort hotel located in the province or nearby Northwestern Ontario, or a day trip to one of the fairs and festivals that crowd the tourist agenda around this weekend, it represents the perfect time to get away.\nIt is also the peak travel time for those who have chosen to explore the broader universe on a Mediterranean Cruise or that long dreamed about trip to New York or San Francisco and end up reading this column online as they laze about far away from home. Wherever readers may be finding this column today, I wish you the best for the weekend and hope you are having an outstanding summer.\n\nToday's column, like the people who may be reading from near or far, will be a potpourri of information relating to questions and comments I have received most recently.\n\nSmoke gets in your eyes\nThe recent haze that descended over our province from fires in Northern Saskatchewan may have been irritating to us, but to the tourist industry in our neighbouring province it was devastating. While firefighters from many parts of Canada were summoned to help quell the flames, fishing lodges and other similar resort properties in Saskatchewan experienced significant numbers of cancellations from American customers, whom they depend upon to have a successful season. As the fires raged on and spread out over wider sections of land, the tourism attractions around La Ronge faced a real crisis. As the firefighters started to gain greater control over the situation, Tourism Saskatchewan tried to quell the fears of those who were considering cancelling northern travel plans by highlighting those areas where smoke would not affect those going fishing, camping, golfing or other recreational activities.\nWhile the area around Lac La Ronge gets significant numbers of U.S. and overseas visitors, the entire area around Prince Albert National Park attracts visitors from throughout Canada as well. In the same way hurricanes can impact the tourism economy of many of our sunny destinations, weather patterns can take a similar toll on our own Canadian attractions when it gets out of hand.\n\nCuba calling\nMy column on Cuba a couple of weeks back generated more feedback than I would have expected. I had a number of people suggest they were going to give Cuba more consideration this year as a result of the information provided in the column. Somehow the column conveyed, more than intended, the perception that Cuba would rapidly be inundated with hundreds of thousands of new tourists from the United States, changing the idyllic nature of the destination, which in many ways has become a Canadian sanctuary. Change will occur as an evolutionary process which we may hardly notice at first as the American government slowly opens the doors to the broader public beyond the relatively narrow restrictions in place now.\nThis may take a few years but there is no question in my mind that the opportunities for U.S. citizens to visit Cuba will also come faster than many expect. And it is a good time to look at this truly interesting winter hot-spot more than you may have in the past if you wish to experience it before it undergoes the natural changes of another resort building boom.\n\nBooking to Greece never stopped\nAs Greek politicians worked with the other nations of the Eurozone to stay economically alive, many believed travellers would forsake the destination in fear they would not be able to access cash, or protests would erupt and create potential travel or service industry problems.\nAccording to a recent report issued by the British company GfK Ascent on leisure travel bookings, that did not take place, and in fact bookings were up during that period of uncertainty.\nIn June, during the peak of negotiations, bookings were up three per cent from the same period last year, while airport arrival numbers from the Greek Civil Aviation Authority saw a 3.2 per cent spike in visitors. There does not appear to be any cutback in bookings going forward as people realize the islands of Greece are among the best to visit during the fall period when many other destinations start to experience colder weather.\nShould you travel to Greece? I have no doubt you will love it. Will you love it enough to follow in the footsteps of movie stars Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They are part of the wealthy class from around the world who are prepared to spend as much as $5million dollars for islands in Greece that have come on the market as a part of the recent Greece bailout plan.\nThere are up to 6000 islands in the nation and investors from around the world want a piece of those lands for themselves. You can become one of them by going to www.privateislandsonline.com . Other big names like Sean Connery and Tom Hanks already own land in Greece.\n\nForward your travel questions to askjourneys@journeystravel.com. Ron Pradinuk can be heard Sundays at noon on CJOB.
