CRT Midi-Pyrenees - D. VIET Why Visit Moissac \nMoissac in the Tarn-et-Garonne department in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France is a delightful discovery. It’s a small, rather sleepy place with a boat marina where barges moor for the night. It’s best known for its spectacular St-Pierre Abbey, one of the major stopping places for those on pilgrimages from Le Puy-en-Velay to St James of Compostella in Spain . \nLocation Moissac stands where the Canal de Garonne meets the Tarn river, part of the system of central France canals which links the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and near where the Tarn meets the Garonne. \nHighlights \nThe Abbey Church of St-Pierre is a masterpiece. Originally founded in the 7 th century as a Benedictine Abbey church, St-Pierre was remodeled in 1063. \nApproach it through a narrow winding street and you’re faced with the superb south entrance , a huge porch with a recessed doorway. Intricately carved columns of warm golden-colored stone hold up a tympanum depicting Christ in the center, raising his right hand and surrounded by the evangelists. You need to be an expert or theologian to recognize the others: they’re the elders of the Apocalypse described in St. John’s Book of Revelation. \nAfter the entrance way, the interior, remodeled in the 15 th century, is a little disappointing in scale. But look out for the statuary, like the 15 th century wooden sculpture, The Flight into Egypt . And up-end the monk’s misericords in the choir for their carved misericords, the small wooden shelf which let the monk rest against during the long hours of prayer and chanting. \nNext to the abbey is one of the most beautiful and peaceful cloisters you could ever hope to find. Finished in 1100, it’s a large structure where the monks could walk, talk if they were allowed to and contemplate whatever monks contemplated. It looks onto the interior garden planted with a large cedar in the middle. Marble columns hold up the roof, each with an intricately carved stone at the top depicting animals and plants, saints and scenes from the Bible. \nOn the Pilgrim Route \nBecause of its abbey, Moissac was on the pilgrim route from Le-Puy-en-Velay to St. James of Compostella in Spain (GR65 walking route). If you want to walk the route, check out the Major Pilgrim Routes of France. Moissac Abbey is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in France under the Routes of Santiago de Compostela classification, along with places like Conques in the Tarn gorges. \nWhere to Stay \nI visited Moissac on a barge trip from Montauban to Agen . But if you want to stay there on an individual vacation, try the Moulin de Moissac , a large hotel and spa overlooking the river and near the marina. 1 Promenade Sancert, 00 33 (0)5 63 32 88 88. \nWhere to Eat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T02:18:11.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
