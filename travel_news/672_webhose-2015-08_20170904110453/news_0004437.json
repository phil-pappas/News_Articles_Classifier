The third edition of the sumptuous Epicurean Market returns to the city state FOODIES FROM all over the region and beyond will be making their way to Singapore next week as the Marina Bay Sands plays host to the third edition of the extravagant Epicurean Market. Running from August 14 to 16, it will feature more than 60 leading brands and some 35 master classes by top chefs, wine sommeliers and mixologists. Singapore has long been a culinary destination for travellers, thanks to its diverse cultural background, evolving dining scene as well as international influences. But during these special three days Singapore will be offering a great deal more. Epicurean Market 2015 is aiming to be bigger and better than ever, with the region's finest food purveyors, award-winning restaurants and wine experts all set to offer guests an unforgettable culinary experience. Consider the amount of food that will be prepared for this three-day food fiesta, and you'll appreciate the scale of the Epicurean Market. Some 2,000 kilograms of seafood will be prepped and 20,000 fresh oysters shucked, along with 20 kilograms of caviar, and an estimated 15,000 pizzas. On top of that, a troupe of mixologists will be armed with enough artillery to keep the spirits and fine cocktails flowing from morning until late at night. During the course of the three days Sands Expo and Convention Centre Halls D and E will be littered with celebrity chef restaurant booths. Among the big names are db Bistro & Oyster by Daniel Boulud, Adrift by David Myers, CUT by Wolfgang Puck and Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza by Nancy Silverton. Favourites like Waku Ghin by Tetsuya Wakuda will make a return this year with an array of new signature dishes. The chef is also expanding his repertoire with a second booth focusing on 12 exquisitely delicate pastries. Tasty Thai treats aromatic beef skewers, grilled eggplant salad with dried prawn, charred rice noodles with pork and yellow beans, and deep-fried chicken with plum sauce from Long Chim by David Thompson will delight foodies. And participating in Epicurean Market for the first time is Spago by Wolfgang Puck, who will offer hand-made Agnolotti and Spicy tuna tartare as a sneak preview ahead of its official opening. There is also a Farmer's Market inspired by the farmer's markets of California and featuring great quality fresh vegetables, roots, fruits and seafood as well as artisanal products in an authentic and rustic environment. Guests can sample and taste food throughout the Farmer's Market, interact with experts for home-cooking tips, and pick up a recipe card or two.
