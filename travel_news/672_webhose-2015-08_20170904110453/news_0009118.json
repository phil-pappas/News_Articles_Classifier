The partnership takes effect from August 2015 and will connect Khiri with outbound tour operators and travel agents in central Europe who are seeking innovative and responsible itineraries in Southeast Asia. \nSince its foundation in 2011, R Asien has built its reputation by sourcing original travel itineraries in 12 European and Asian countries. “Khiri Travel’s recent Travelife certification for Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam will help us connect discerning travel agents in Europe with a Southeast Asian DMC that has a responsible and audited approach,” says Martin Rokyta, General Manager and founder of R Asien. R Asien will now sell Khiri Travel’s experiences in Southeast Asia including award winning trips to Banteay Chhmar tented camp in Cambodia and discovery tours to remote corners of Myanmar, among many more mainstream options. “With Travelife certification we are internally set-up for success,” says Andre van der Marck, Vice President, Khiri Travel. “The time is right for Khiri to work with great GSA partners such as R Asien to enter new markets and really open their eyes to what we can offer to FITs, groups and MICE clients,” says van der Marck.
