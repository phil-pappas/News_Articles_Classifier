But she has lately developed an interest in Victorian Gothic architecture, of which there's a lot in Manchester.\nWhich is how we find ourselves in the unlovely suburbs of south Manchester, heading for the Midland Hotel in the city centre.\nIt's raining, of course.\nInviting: Manchester, with its grand university at its core, is a city of inspiring architecture and fine food\n'It's drier west of the Pennines,' I joke.\nI have the usual Yorkshireman's prejudice against the red rose county, and I'm suspicious of the way Manchester has been anointed by George Osborne as a sort of trainee London.\nWe park beneath the old Manchester Central railway station, now a convention centre.\nThe adjacent hotel - a fantastical cliff-face of rusticated masonry (not Victorian Gothic but Edwardian baroque) - was once the station hotel and the colour of the terracotta is known as teapot-brown.\nLisa, however, is more enthused by the interior of our twin-bedded 'Superior' accommodation: 'John Lewis sheets; tiles, not laminates, in the bathroom.' I remind her of the price.\n'It would cost three times that in London,' she says. A sonorous bell tolls midday. The Town Hall clock is round the corner, in Albert Square.\nTen minutes later, we are inside.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Italy's capital of fizz! Taking a trip down 'Prosecco Road',...

Share this article Share As Lisa marvels at the spiral staircase, and the tiling of the Great Hall, I recall that the Mayors of Manchester used to live in the Town Hall, which must have been like inhabiting a small cathedral.\nWe walk to Deansgate for another dose of Victorian Gothic, the John Rylands Library, built in 1899.\nIn the cloistered Reading Room - reminiscent of Hogwarts school - we ask a man if he'd mind taking our picture.\n'I'd be absolutely delighted,' he says.\nMr Thomas's Chop House on Cross Street is a good spot for lunch: a fish-and-mushy-pea sandwich with chips for me, winter vegetable soup for Lisa.\nAnd you can while away an afternoon in Manchester Art Gallery on Mosley Street, which Lisa pronounces one of the best galleries she's ever been in.\nFor dinner, we go to Chinatown, which always reminds me of a Raymond Chandler novel, with its bright neon, dark alleys, and leaking steam.\nWe have a shamelessly generic Chinese meal at Great Wall on Faulkner Street. The Whitworth Gallery on Oxford Road, newly re-opened after a £15 million refurbishment that revealed many of its original Edwardian features, is well worth visiting.\nWalking in the city often requires umbrellas.\n'But then all this sombre red brick suits the rain,' says Lisa. Which is just as well.\nAndrew Martin's latest book is Belles And Whistles: Five Journeys Through Time On Britain's Trains (Profile).\nTravel Facts: Plan your own long weekend in Manchester Double rooms at the Midland Hotel (0161 236 3333, www.qhotels.co.uk ) from £110 per night B&B.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LeShoB", "http://www.qhotels.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-08-17T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:43:49.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
