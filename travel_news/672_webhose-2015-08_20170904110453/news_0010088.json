Beginning Sept. 14, Car2Go will shrink its home area and will exclude formerly served neighborhoods such as Washington Park, North Park Hill, Globeville and others. Why? The company said in a statement that \"the sheer size of Denver's Home Area does not allow members to easily access a Car2Go vehicle, as it requires our vehicles to be spread out too thin in low demand areas where they are idle more than twice as long as our vehicles in high demand areas.\" The Denver Post reported that Car2Go has about 350 cars in the Denver area, and some residents whose service is being cut aren't too happy about the new plan.
