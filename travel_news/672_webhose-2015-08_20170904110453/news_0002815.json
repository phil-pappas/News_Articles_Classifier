These luxury suites are the newest in Budapest and offer a remarkable combination of fresh, spacious and elegant interiors, measuring 70 m2 and costing €699 per night. Guests staying in the Executive Suites also receive complimentary access to the Executive Lounge and the Royal Spa. \nFrom the new lighting touches to the harmonic mix of materials and furniture, the reborn suites invoke a decidedly ‘home away from home’ feel for their sophisticated clientele. The scope of the renovation includes vast living areas; two separate bathrooms with a bathtub, shower and walk-in wardrobe; and the ultimate comfort and advanced technology through architectural finishes and fixtures, as well as custom-designed furniture. Each Suite features an implemented media hub, a Nespresso coffee machine, two interactive 24 inch LCD TVs, as well as new furniture reflecting the latest interior décor trends. Guests staying in an Executive Suite also benefit from complimentary access to the Executive Lounge, which features private check-in and check-out with a complimentary welcome drink, as well as a selection of complimentary snacks, canapés, and drinks served throughout the day. The mobile check-in and tailor-made Concierge services promise to further enhance guests’ experience at Corinthia Budapest. The Lounge – also the perfect place for a more private breakfast – further boasts a comprehensive library of books and newspapers, business centre facilities, a boardroom, and a television room. Executive Suite bookers will also receive complimentary access to the Royal Spa, which boasts a 15-metre pool, Jacuzzis, saunas and a steam bath – perfect to unwind after the day. At the Royal Spa, the city’s rich historical traditions of spas and healing waters blend seamlessly with ESPA’s cutting-edge treatments and technologies. Unique atmosphere, utmost tranquillity and bright spaces abound in the Executive Suites, where neutral shades of taupe and light grey adorning the walls are carefully contrasted by highlighted flashes of jewel-like colours from furnishings, while the stunning glass panel makes a striking contrast between the soft bedding and velvety carpets. Residential in atmosphere, spacious, and airy rooms, these Executive One-Bedroom Suites are a refreshing and utterly relaxing oasis of modern interior design. “This major renovation proves our dedication to the constant development and investment in guest comfort, so we are better able to provide our guests with world class and personalised service. We wanted to tip a hat to the rich, historic feel of the Corinthia Hotel Budapest, but also ensure the new suites have a contemporary feel. Our goal was to give guests the sense that while they are walking into a modern setting, they quickly understand that this is a timeless design,” said Jean Pierre Mifsud, General Manager at Corinthia Budapest. Complimentary WiFi is available throughout the hotel. Rates for the new Executive Suites at Corinthia Budapest start at €699+VAT per night, including complimentary use of the Executive Club and the Royal Spa.
