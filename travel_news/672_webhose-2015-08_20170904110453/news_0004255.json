Relax in the property's common room which allows a perfect view of the loch and its famous rumoured resident\nSteve Feltham, 52, originally from Dorset, has spent 24 years watching Loch for glimpse of Nessie, but now believes the monster is merely a large catfish\nIt was from the upstairs windows where a famous sighting by a visiting Reverend and his family took place in 1933.\nNessie Hunter Steve Feltham explained: 'Years ago the youth hostel was a tea room. There was a very famous sighting there from some women having tea.'\nHe continued: 'At 11am on 23rd September Rev W.E Hobbes arrived at the Half-Way House Tea room, and walked in to find the room deserted.\n'He called out and heard 'We can't come down yet, we're looking at the monster'.'\nThe Reverend, who was with his wife and sister, rushed to the window and saw a creature with two humps, a tail and a 'snake like head and neck,moving from side to side'.\nThe hostel, which sits on the north shore, is made up of an original stone building and modern extensions and is on the market for offers over £395,000\nThe hostel has two kitchens, a large common room, lounge and laundry room as well as almost an acre of grounds\nAccording to the records the Reverend said: 'My wife and sister were most excited.'\nHowever, the proprietor of the tea house was less surprised, and even declared she had 'seen the monster three times before'.\nJust a few years later, local man John MacLean reported seeing Nessie - also described as a creature with two humps and a tail - from inside the building.\nThe eye witness account from Tom Harmsworth's Loch Ness information website states it was 'a sighting of a head and neck at a range of only 20 yards'.\nIt continues: 'Mr MacLean claims that the creature was in the process of swallowing and did so in the manner of a cormorant.\n'Shortly afterwards the entire length of the monster with two humps and a tail became visible. The whole animal then lay on the surface for several minutes.'\nThe bedrooms have views out onto the loch so you can look for Nessie even as you get ready to go to bed\nThe hostel was also at the centre of one of the most infamous hoaxes.\nThe iconic 'Surgeon's Photograph' from 1934, a black and white image showing a neck and head coming out of the water, was taken from the banks beside the hostel.\nThe images were eventually declared fakes, made using a toy submarine and orchestrated by big game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell.\nWetherell had been publicly ridiculed after finding 'Nessie footprints' that turned out to be those of a hippopotamus-foot umbrella stand.\nFor revenge he allegedly sold his hoax photos to a daily newspaper. However some experts still believe the images are authentic.\nMore recent sightings in the area include one in 2006 when Mrs Murphy from Inverness, who was driving past the youth hostel, stopped after spotting something in the water.\nAccording to records she saw a black cone shaped creature circle round in a whirlpool like motion which lasted about four minutes.\nThe hostel, currently in the ownership of the Scottish Youth Hostel Association, is open in the summer time and is run by a team of volunteers.\nKeith Legge, Chief Executive of Scottish Youth Hostels Association, said with the youth hostel facing more competition the decision was taken to sell it.\nKeith Legge (right), Chief Executive of Scottish Youth Hostels Association, said with the youth hostel facing more competition the decision was taken to sell it", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eD8uZ4"], "published": "2015-07-30T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T19:52:43.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
