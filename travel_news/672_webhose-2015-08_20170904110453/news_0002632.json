Whether the recent killing of Cecil the African lion by a Minnesota dentist who paid $50,000 for a guided safari was legal remains unclear. But despite that rather critical legal uncertainty about 400,000 animal rights activists and/or soft-hearted sentimentalists in this country signed a petition demanding that U.S. airlines stop allowing the transport of big game trophies.\nDelta, in an amazingly quick demonstration of spinelessness, caved. American and United, in pathetic fits of me-too-ishness, immediately imposed similar bans. Arguably their cowardice is all the greater. Delta at least carried the lion’s share of big game trophies back from Africa because it actually offers non-stop service between the United States and five African destinations. United and American carried few, if any big game trophies back to the States because United only flies to one African destination, while no American flight ever touches down there.\nEven counting the small number of trophies the Big Three likely took in transfer from other airlines at European hubs, the reality is that big game trophies never presented anything close to a meaningful slice of airline revenue. In Delta’s case, it reported carrying $207,000 million worth of cargo in the quarter ended June 30. That’s less than 2 percent of its total second quarter revenue of $10.7 billion. And big game trophies are a teeny-tiny fraction of even that already inconsequential amount – not enough to constitute even a rounding error.\nThus, one can only conclude that Delta’s, United’s and American sudden shifts in policy regarding transport of big game trophies back from Africa were, at best, incredibly cynical efforts to deflect criticism on a subject of virtually no economic importance to them. It’s was easy for them to respond in a politically correct way because it cost them nothing.\nSo one day carrying the dried, salted and, in some cases, mounted skins, heads and horns of big game was a normal – and completely moral, though small – business practice? But he next day, after feeling a bit of heat from agitated activists, that same business practice is so morally reprehensible that the companies outlaw it? Such a flip flop in the face of small, but loud and public opposition pretty much defines corporate cowardice.\nYes, lots of Americans are disturbed about the killing of Cecil (interestingly, Africans themselves tend to celebrate the killing of such fearsome menaces to their families, health and property). But lots of other people either don’t care, or see nothing wrong at all wrong with it, provided the hunt was conducted legally and ethically (there remain legitimate questions on both scores).\nDoubt that? Look at the numbers. PETA – People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals – whose members and online communications network facilitated the rapid creation and growth of the petition to which the airlines responded, has about three million members. But the National Rifle Association is more than 40 percent larger, with about 4.5 million members. Assuredly, neither organization’s degree of public support is defined by their formal membership numbers. Both have many more supporters than they do actual members. But the sheer size of the hunting and outdoors industry; the amount of travel demand created by hunting, gun and outdoors enthusiasts; and the number of registered U.S. gun owners argues overwhelmingly that those opposed to big game hunting are far outnumbered by those who do support, or at least accept it as either a morally good or morally neutral practice.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:15:16.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
