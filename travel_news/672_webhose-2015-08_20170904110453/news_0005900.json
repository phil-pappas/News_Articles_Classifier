Martinez says sending youngsters on loan to foreign leagues will not help their Premier League ambitions, and they should only head abroad if they are leaving English football entirely. The Spanish coach said he experimented while Swansea manager with offering young players opportunities playing in a foreign league, only to realise they returned ill-equipped to readjust to the demands of English football. • Why John Stones is not worth £30m Glenn cited the examples of Chelsea’s Lewis Baker and Dominic Solanke, currently on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, as the first of what could be a broader trend. \"I don't agree with that,” said Martnez. Chelsea's Dominic Solanke is spending the year in the Netherlands “The development of a young player should be closely monitored by his club and the moment they go abroad it becomes too distant. My own experience of sending players abroad is you lose touch and it's very dangerous because they need to adapt to a lifestyle and a different football culture. \"There are many elements in a move abroad that can put your development at risk. If you could send a player abroad for a month and then bring him back it would be fantastic for them, but you have to wait from window to window and that is too long. It's not healthy for their development. Roberto Martinez has poured scorn on the FA chief exec's suggestions “The other aspect is that while you can learn tactically and technically, you don't get the physicality that our league has and it is very dangerous to develop a player away from that. They can be lost to the English league without that physicality, 100%. “I had a couple of players at Swansea, Chad Bond and Kieran Morgan, who I sent to the fourth level in Spain and to a club close to my hometown (CF Balaguer) because I knew the people and thought they would be well looked after. It was a shock what happened.” Martinez draws a distinction between players heading abroad to prepare for life as Premier League footballer, or those who determine – as he did when leaving Spain for the lower divisions in England – they will achieve more be relocating overseas to broaden their horizons personally as much as professionally. “There are two aspects to this,” he explained. “One, when you want to develop a player as a Premier League football club it doesn't work, in my experience, to send the player abroad. He is not going to go away and be ready to hit the ground running physically in the Premier League when he comes back. It works when he goes out on loan within the British game whatever level it is. \"Two, if you don't get an opportunity in the Premier League, if it doesn't work out for you here, then going abroad is the best thing you can do as a young footballer because you need to mature, you need to open up as a human being, you see different ways of playing the game and you have to adapt.” Everton, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of 18-year-old Mason Holgate from Barnsley . Mason Holgate is now an Everton player Leighton Baines, however, has undergone further surgery on his ankle to rule him out until November. Luke Garbutt has also undergone surgery for an identical problem. “We feel it will be the same recovery time as the last operation, which was between 12 and 16 weeks,” said Martinez. \"It won't affect my transfer plans because we've got Bryan Oviedo, who I consider fully fit even though he is not match-fit, and Brendan Galloway, who I am quite happy will have an important role in the first team this season.” TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T02:09:15.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
