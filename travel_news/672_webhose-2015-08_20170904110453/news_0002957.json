The flight was delayed by around five hours until sober crew members had been located. \nPassengers were reportedly told that the pilot was “unwell”. \nJanis Vanagds, an AirBaltic spokesperson, told the Latvian website LSM that it has a “zero tolerance policy”. \n“Zero tolerance means no alcohol,” Vanags said, “It’s very straightforward - safety is our number one priority. \n“There has been an initial test and that is being followed up with more detailed tests. When we have the results we will take appropriate action. I apologise to all customers who have been affected by this incident.” \nHelena Therese Langeland, a passenger on board, said: “It is surprising that people who have such huge responsibility in their jobs, don’t take it seriously and have so little professionalism.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:19:50.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
