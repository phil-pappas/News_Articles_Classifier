Our plans mean more train managers on board our trains, not less.\n\"The key issue remains that we want the driver to close the doors - which is fundamental to our ability to run the faster, more frequent services customers should expect from a 21st century railway. This method has been used safely across the UK rail industry for decades.\"\nFGW said it expects to run most of its London Thames Valley trains, but services including those between South Wales and London, Plymouth and London, Cardiff and Portsmouth, Bristol and Taunton and Bristol and Gloucester will be affected.\nNo service will run between Weymouth and Westbury, while some services in Devon and Cornwall will be cancelled.\nThe RMT said it disputed the level of services the company could run on strike days.\nLast updated Wed 12 Aug 2015 Travel First Great Western", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:19:02.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
