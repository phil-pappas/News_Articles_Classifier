Share this article Share While you won't be able to stay in the sprawling castle itself, some of the rooms will have a view of the architectural marvel L'Orangerie, which was used to house Louis XIV's 3,000 orange trees during the winter months.\n'There will be no other hotel in the world like this one,' said a palace spokesman, according to The Telegraph . 'This is an emblem of French history and a cultural landmark. It will be an authentically royal experience.'\nHotel de l'Orangerie, as its been nicknamed, will boast views of the architectural marvel and will be housed in three 17th-century mansions on site\nVersailles is home to the famed Hall of Mirrors, located in the central gallery of the palace and is one of the building's most remarkable features\nThe sprawling estate, that was erected in a rural location but now forms part of a wealthy suburb of Paris, was famously the home of Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette.\nThe court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682 until the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789.\nAs such, the castle is infamous for not only its stunning grandeur but also as a symbol of the country's Ancien Regime and its absolute monarchy.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were said to be interested in hosting their over-the-top nuptials at the palace in 2013 - but such requests were denied.\nThey did, however, host their rehearsal dinner at the famed chateau, offering guests an exclusive tour of the property and a private performance by Lana Del Ray.\nThe Royal Chapel, where the King and Queen often heard mass, is every bit as opulent as the rest of the sprawling estate\nDespite hoping to hold their wedding ceremony at Versailles, the celebrity couple was only granted permission to host a rehearsal dinner on the property. Pictured: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in Italy\nThe mansions will need to undergo extensive renovations - at a cost of up to £10 million - before opening. Pictured: the home's Latona fountain\nBut, despite all of the publicity surrounding the lavish home in recent years, state funding for the palace has been cut from €47.4 million (£33.6 million) in 2013 to €40.5 million this year.\nThe successful bidder of the Hotel de l'Orangerie, as it has tentatively been named, will be given a 60-year licence to operate it and will be required to pay a portion of the profits to the palace.\nThe mansions are currently empty, as they have been for the past several years, and will need to be renovated before opening.\nA spokesman has reportedly estimated the cost to be up to £10 million.\nMailOnline Travel has contacted a member of the Versailles press team for comment.\nRead more: Palace of Versailles forced to put up paying guests - Telegraph", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11805989/Palace-of-Versailles-forced-to-put-up-paying-guests.html", "http://dailym.ai/1WCk4G4"], "published": "2015-08-19T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:13:06.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
