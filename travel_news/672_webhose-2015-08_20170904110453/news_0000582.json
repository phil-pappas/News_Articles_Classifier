By simply looking up, they can spy Andean condors majestically gliding through the sky. The more attentive may spot a gray fox, eagles and falcons.\nResearchers have also uncovered signs of human inhabitants that date back to between the years 120 BC and 1180 AD, in rock paintings and petroglyphs.\nSonia Gonzales, a park guide, said “different groups” have lived in the region over the years.\n“Nomadic groups are always mentioned, due to the lack of evidence of residences or burial grounds, groups that passed through the place, using it perhaps as grazing land,” she said.\nMajestic and imposing, Talampaya National Park, considered to be Argentina’s answer to the Grand Canyon in the United States, offers visitors to the country’s northwest an ideal place for hiking, photo safaris and bird watching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:26:03.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
