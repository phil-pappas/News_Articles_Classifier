Only thousand people received free tickets to enter the park while hundreds of locals queued up in the seafront to get in.\nThe park’s website suggests that tickets are available online but a bizarre booking process has frustrated would be visitors and they are wondering whether the park is playing a prank with them. The booking page suggests that passengers can book £3 timed tickets for ten following days. The website also suggests that they can pick their days for the visit. But the form is only a static image which users cannot click.\nSome park goers are now wondering whether the park actually exists. But pictures of the park taken by the press show fairly bleak and dystopian park complete with cartoonish airport-style security at the entrance, and crumbling and peeling scenery, some of which is the remnants of the Tropicana swimming pool, which closed in 2000 due to declining visitor numbers.\nHowever those who did visit the park said that it is an amazing experience and everyone should go. With all the attractions that the website is offering online visitors are tempted to take a visit, but the park is mismanaged and cannot show to its many visitors the attractions featuring names like Run the Jewels, Sleaford Mods, Pussy Riot and Massive Attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:03:44.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
