The wind had picked up, pleasing the kite boarders who were skidding across the bay but irritating some tourists on long boards who were hoping to ride some postcard-worthy breaks.\nThe shirtless teenage attendant at the local surf shop shrugged when asked about conditions the next day. “I don’t predict anymore,” he said.\nNearby, a group of European backpackers lounged on the sand and sang Oasis songs, determined to wait for better waves.\nThe ebb and flow of the surf are part of life in Essaouira , a walled waterfront city still guarded by a 16th-century Portuguese fort. In the medina, surf shops and board schools dot the ancient streets, next to the old craftsmen offering leather bags, jewelry and rugs.\nIn the 1970s, Yves Saint Laurent and Talitha Getty were famously lounging on the rooftops of Marrakesh while a three-hour bus ride to the west, surfers were busily caravanning along the coast, searching out big breaks.\nPhotos and films of Morocco’s waves began appearing in surf enclaves in California, Australia and Europe, inspiring the sport’s adventure seekers.\nToday hard-core surfers around the world know Morocco.\nThe long Atlantic coast line is renowned for its picturesque point breaks and “perfect rights” — waves that curl to the right.\n“It totally is something special,” said Taylor Paul, editor at large for Surfing Magazine, who has written about surfing in Morocco. “It is one of those places every surfer feels like they should get to.”\nEssaouira is the northern outpost for many of Morocco’s surf tourists, who take a couple of nights to wander the narrow stone streets where, in 1948, Orson Welles filmed “Othello.” From the city, the N1 highway stretches down the coast, connecting to the surf centers of Taghazout and Agadir, about 100 miles to the south.\nThe coast, where the nomadic Berbers once roamed, still offers a variety of secluded locations, including what Mr. Paul calls “waves of consequence” — the hollow, powerful waves coveted by the sport’s elite.\nSpots with names like Boilers, Anchor Point and Killers draw wave riders from around the world.\nMany of the best spots haven’t been discovered by the mainstream surf crowd, said Nigel Cross, co-director of Moroccan Surf Adventures, which has operated surf tours for 10 years. “It’s an enormous coastline.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T09:49:23.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
