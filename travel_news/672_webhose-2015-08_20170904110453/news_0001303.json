Guests are now able to borrow a GoPro camera and accessories free of charge from the hotel’s reception desk, and use the camera to capture immersive video and photo footage during their stay. \nGuests will also be encouraged to engage with the hotel’s website and social media channels, sharing the videos and snapshots of their local experiences with friends, family, and other travellers across the globe. By sharing these holiday memories, participants automatically enter to win a five-night stay at the Marina Hotel. For more information, see: www.marinahotel.com.mt/gopro/ “We believe in offering a true experience, rather than just a stay, in Malta. We have therefore entered this exciting partnership with GoPro – to allow our guests to record and preserve the memory of their discoveries. Every guest has his or her story and we now encourage all of our guests to truly Discover Malta, Discover Marina,” said Stuart Chappell, General Manager at the Marina Hotel Corinthia Beach Resort.
