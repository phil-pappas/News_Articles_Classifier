Women should take a gap of two years between pregnancies, as the study claims that getting pregnant in less than a year apart might have a greater risk for osteoporosis later in life. \nOsteoporosis is a medical condition in which the bones become brittle and fragile from loss of tissue, typically as a result of hormonal changes, or deficiency of calcium or vitamin D. \nFor the study, researchers compared the reproductive histories of 239 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to 298 similar women without thinning bones. \nAccording to the study, pregnancies no more than 12 months apart were linked to a four-fold higher risk of osteoporosis. \nLead author of the study Dr. Gulcin Sahin Esroy of the Yale School of said that they already knew that postmenopausal osteoporosis was directly influenced by the pregnancy itself as well as other variables in obstetric history such as breastfeeding and age at first pregnancy, the Fox News reported. \nThe researchers analysed bone tissue of postmenopausal women and found in addition to brief intervals between pregnancies, a first pregnancy before age 27 may also increase the risk of osteoporosis. \nThey didn?t find a difference in osteoporosis risk between women who waited two to three years between pregnancies and women who had a gap of more than five years. \nHence, Esroy suggested that women should wait two years before planning another child.
