This was driven by strong operational performance at Aeroflot airline and the successful roll-out of Russia’s first low-cost carrier, Pobeda, which has quickly become one the top airlines in the country. The Group also benefited from changes in the competitive landscape, taking market share from foreign carriers that decreased frequencies on a number of routes as well as less efficient Russian peers.\n“Our focus on the high-growth domestic market paid off with strong increases in Group traffic, which drove revenue up 25.8% year-on-year to RUB 176.5 billion, while strict cost control reined in growth of operational expenses despite exchange rate volatility. As a result, in the first half of 2015 Aeroflot Group posted an operating profit of RUB 5.9 billion; EBITDA and EBITDAR also rose, and the EBITDA and EBITDAR margins increased 3.9 and 6.9 percentage points to 7.5% and 18.8%, respectively.\n“The Group focused on fleet optimisation, cost-cutting, boosting efficiency of business processes and financial management, and maintaining a robust financial position. We are confident our policy of expanding our presence on the growing Russian market, maintaining customer loyalty and increasing business efficiency will enable continued growth in the Group’s profitability as the Russian economy recovers.”\nKey operating highlights\n6M 2015 6M 2014 Change Passengers carried, thousand PAX 17,855 15,666 14.0% international 7,558 7,948 (4.9%) domestic 10,297 7,717 33.4% Revenue Passenger Kilometres, mln 44,479 40,927 8.7% international 25,019 25,787 (3.0%) domestic 19,460 15,141 28.5% Available Seat Kilometres, mln 58,789 54,066 8.7% international 33,007 34,560 (4.5%) domestic 25,782 19,507 32.2% Passenger load factor, % 75.7% 75.7% – international 75.8% 74.6% 1.2 p.p. domestic 75.5% 77.6% (2.1 p.p.)\nOverall passenger traffic for Aeroflot Group in 6M 2015 was 17.9 million, up 14.0% year-on-year.\nKey financial highlights\nRUB million, unless stated otherwise 6M 2015 6M 2014 Change Revenue 176,467 140,281 25.8% EBITDAR 33,252 16,657 99.6% EBITDAR margin 18.8% 11.9% 6.9 p.p.

Revenue from charter flights decreased by 71.0% to RUB 2,075 million, due to the Group’s strategy to decrease its presence in this market segment, as well as overall market dynamics in tourism traffic.\nDespite a 1.0% decrease in the volume of cargo and mail carried in 1H 2015, cargo revenue increased 16.3% year-on-year on the back of stronger yields.\nOther revenues increased by 39.9% year-on-year to 25,863 million, mainly driven by an increase in FX-denominated revenues from airline agreements following changes in the exchange rate.\nOperating costs\nRUB million, unless stated otherwise 6M 2015 6M 2014 Change Aircraft servicing and passenger service 34,516 27,714 24.5% Staff costs 27,235 24,304 12.1% Operating lease expenses 19,941 11,627 71.5% Aircraft maintenance 13,098 9,268 41.3% Sales and marketing, administration and general expenses 11,479 8,974 27.9% Depreciation, amortisation and custom duties 7,445 6,414 16.1% Other costs and expenses 12,173 13,128 (7.3%) Operating costs less aircraft fuel 125,887 101,429 24.1% Aircraft fuel 44,714 40,236 11.1% Total operating costs 170,601 141,665 20.4%\nIn 1H 2015, aircraft fuel costs increased by 11.1% year-on-year to RUB 44,714 million, due to the ruble weakening and increase in traffic volume. Excluding the FX rate effect, aircraft fuel costs decreased by 19.7% due to a decline in oil prices and the Group’s initiatives to improve fuel efficiency.\nOperating costs not including aircraft fuel grew by 24.1% year-on-year to RUB 125,887 million.\nAircraft servicing and passenger services costs amounted to RUB 34,516 million, up 24.5% year-on-year. This increase was mainly due to the changes in the ruble exchange rate versus foreign currencies. Excluding the FX rate effect, these costs increased by 8.0%, primarily due to expanded scale of operations and traffic volume, as well as changes in service rates.\nStaff costs increased by 12.1% year-on-year to RUB 27,235 million, mainly due to additional motivational compensation for cabin crew (including bonuses for the sale of Sky Shop products on board), and increases in the rouble equivalent of salaries for employees based outside Russia.\nOperating lease expenses amounted to RUB 19,941 million, up 71.5% year-on-year, mostly due to the change in the ruble exchange rate (given that these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies). Other growth factors included expansion of the Group’s fleet (net increase of 15 aircraft under operating lease, up 8.2% versus 30 June 2014), and an increase in the 6 month LIBOR rate in 1H 2015.\nAircraft maintenance costs increased by 41.3% year-on-year to RUB 13,098 million, mainly due to the change in the ruble exchange rate. Excluding the FX rate effect, such costs were flat year-on-year.\nSales and marketing, administration and general expenses increased 27.9% year-on-year to RUB 11,479 million. This growth was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses denominated in foreign currencies.\nDepreciation, amortisation and custom duties increased by 16.1% year-on-year to RUB 7,445 million, which was driven by additions of six new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft under finance lease agreements in 1H 2014.\nOther expenses decreased by 7.3% year-on-year to RUB 12,173 million, primarily due to a refund of fuel excise duties as a result of changes in legislation.\nAs a result of the above-mentioned factors, the Group’s operating profit in 1H 2015 amounted to RUB 5,866 million (3.3% of revenue).
