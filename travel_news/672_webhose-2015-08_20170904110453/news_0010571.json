Books 20,000th Customer The Global Work & Travel Co. Books 20,000th Customer   \nThe world’s leading organizer of “working holiday” and “gap year” youth travel packages has reached a major milestone this week. When an Australian traveler booked a five-month working holiday trip to the Canadian ski-country, they became the 20,000th customer in company history. \n\n“We’re pretty excited about it,” admits Jürgen Himmelmann, the CEO of The Global Work & Travel Co. “It’s just one booking, but when you think about what that represents, it’s huge. \n\n“There are 20,000 life-changing stories out there. 20,000 people who have had a chance to see a part of the world they would have never otherwise had an opportunity to visit. That’s 20,000 new opportunities to chalk up ‘international experience’ on a resume. It’s awesome.” \n\n“We’re seeing growth averaging 50% a year, each and every year,” said Himmelmann. “If this continues, we should see number 30,000 in just under a year. We can’t wait.” \n\nThe Global Work & Travel Co. specializes in working holidays. Rather than merely dip a toe in foreign culture, Global assists young travelers by helping them secure the work visa and find seasonal work to fund travel, through a massive network of potential employers. Global also helps arrange accommodation, and organize a range of arrival services to make a big overseas trip less stressful. \n\nTypical positions include working in ski resorts in Canada, on island resorts in Australia, or in pubs and hotels across the UK.The company also offers volunteer projects across the globe, English teaching programs in Asia, au pair and nanny exchanges worldwide and real-world student internship experiences. \n\nThe Global Work & Travel Co. started in 2008 out of a home garage in Surfer’s Paradise, Australia. Since then, Global has grown to over 100 employees, and include offices in London, UK and Vancouver, Canada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T17:07:55.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
