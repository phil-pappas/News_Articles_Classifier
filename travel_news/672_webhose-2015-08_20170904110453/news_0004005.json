Whichever way it has gone , it's a chance to see people one last time before everyone goes their separate ways, and certainly an excuse for a drink, for those who have already turned 18. Of course, drink choice doesn't define you as a human being, but what could your choice of Results Day drink (subjectively) say about you? Disclaimer: We do not condone or encourage drinking heavily; keep yourself upright and you'll have much more fun, honest. 1. Whiskey: Nobody likes cheap whiskey; it’s not a drink for celebrating. But hey, at least you’ve got your friend Jack right? Or at least his supermarket own brand cousin. You will likely be found sitting in a dark corner saying things such as “nobody understands me” and drunk dialling Ucas . It’s probably best if you get someone to take your phone away from you, lest you decide to really burn any bridges. 2. Vodka: This depends on your choice of mixer. A vodka with coke or lemonade is a student staple, and you have clearly decided you need to build up some experience before embarking on fresher’s week . Shots of vodka could either be celebratory or to commiserate, but if you are swigging straight from the bottle then it’s fairly clear things haven’t gone to plan. Put the bottle down. 3. Alcopops: Faced with the prospect of heading off to university , you have decided to cling to your youth in the only way you know how, with alcohol infused liquid e-numbers. Of course your grades went well, as alcoholic fruit juice isn’t exactly a go-to commiseration drink. You can see people shaking their heads at your choice of beverage, but they just taste so good. You make a note to stop drinking them when you get to university. 4. Beer or cider: You got your results, they went fine, but you don’t want to make a big deal out of it. Tonight is just like any other night out, and like any other night out you’re going to have a beer. You are avoiding the emotional wrecks waving bottles of spirits around, and are slightly concerned that people your age are still drinking alcopops, but hey, you can still have a good time. You may never have to see some of these people ever again, and that’s proving to be a quietly satisfying thought. 5. Gin You got into a Russell Group university , didn’t you? Or perhaps you have just decided to take the perceived mature route this Results Day. You are likely to be found explaining your favourite gins to anyone who will listen, and feel immeasurably older than your 18 years when you order a G & T. Unfortunately, you only really know about three gins, and are kind of disappointed that tonic water isn’t just a fancy name for lemonade. 6. Champagne (or something sparkling): Your parents bought this bottle in the hope of celebrating. Hopefully it’s being used for its desired purpose (in which case congratulations) and champagne has probably never tasted so good. The alternative scenario is the bottle has been popped in the hope it will cheer you up, and you’re rather glumly looking for some kind of greater meaning in the bubbles. 7. J20: Unlike many of your peers, you are perfectly capable of having a good time and celebrating without the need for alcohol (or you're the unlucky designated driver). You get to look on with amusement at the carnage around you, and are particularly looking forward to being smug when your friends are hungover tomorrow. It will also make dealing with prying family members that much easier, and if you've missed your grades, not having consumed most of a bar will be a significant advantage in dealing with the setback. 8. Wine: You’re an adult now. Adults drink wine. You’ve just got on to an English or philosophy course, most probably. That’s what they do on those courses isn’t it? Sit around drinking wine and solving the intellectual challenges of the world. You want to know your Chardonnay from your Chianti before you head off. Of course, none of this applies if it’s boxed wine, in which case you are probably trying to forget the day. Were your results really important? Who knows, certainly not you – at least not until the morning anyway. 9. Tequila: Things have gone well, very well. Your parents are happy, you’re in a good mood and tequila shots are on special offer in the local pub. You have decided to be conservative so just order the 10, and are busy trying to make sure everyone around you has one. You’re probably going to regret it in the morning, or maybe even later in the evening, but boy are you going to have fun for now. 10. Jagermeister: You have decided to get a jump on freshers and celebrate like you’ve already got that first class degree in your pocket (you don’t, by the way). You know jaeger bombs are a thing, and that university students drink them, but you’re not quite sure what they are exactly. Not letting that stop you, you’ve ordered one for everyone in sight, including your English teacher who has turned up to congratulate you all. 11. Red Bull: Screw A-levels, who needs them anyway? Russell Brand thinks it’s all rhubarb, and you’re inclined to agree at this point. While everyone else is out partying, you find yourself in a caffeine induced haze, feverishly planning what might possibly be the very best and most ambitious gap year of all time . You’re going to save the world, learn to sky dive, and swim with dolphins, and that’s just next week. Of course your parents will want to help you fund such an adventure, why wouldn’t they? On second thoughts, better start looking for a job. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T13:18:24.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
