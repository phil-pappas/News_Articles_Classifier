IT&CMA has constantly proven itself as a top-notch platform that delivers buyers with validated procurement power. Our presence at the show will enable us to develop direct relationship with corporate and MICE players within ASEAN and international markets.” “The visibility and brand exposure we will achieve at IT&CMA is definitely an attractive motivation to exhibit. Participating for the first time independently with our self-branded booth ensures we have a focused real estate space to establish Resorts World Sentosa brand and presence in ASEAN market and to worldwide MICE buyers.” A cluster of unique attractions including themed parks, hotels, spa, casino, and meeting & incentive venues all under one roof, makes Resort World Sentosa Singapore the perfect MICE venue. The column-free, state-of-the-art mega Resorts World Ballroom with its 11-metre high ceiling and 6,000 square metres of unobstructed space, has hosted numerous high profile corporate and social events, as well as concerts. With a simple segregation, it can be transformed into three ballrooms or nine mega halls with flexible seating configuration, including VIP rooms and other holding rooms. Secretarial rooms, video conferencing and other facilities can easily be arranged upon request. Apart from ballrooms and function rooms, Resorts World Sentosa Singapore also boasts of extraordinary venues for organising talk-of-the-town events. Strut down 1950’s New York Street at Universal Studios Singapore; throw a lavish banquet against a panoramic backdrop of swimming manta rays and other exotic marine animals at S.E.A. Aquarium; hold an intimate networking session in a wine cellar at Palio; or make it a rock and roll celebration at Hard Rock Hotel Singapore.
