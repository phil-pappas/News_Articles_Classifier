Here’s what you need to know.\nFLIGHTS\nBoth Jetstar and Virgin deemed the route unsafe to fly in consultation with their experts, meaning hundreds of Aussies were left stranded.\nMost airlines will re-book passengers in available seats on upcoming flights or schedule additional flights to help clear the backlog.\nWith airlines now given the all clear to fly, Jetstar says it has scheduled up to 30 additional flights between now and Friday to help get customers on their way.\n“In these types of events, we always look to adjust our schedule so that we can free up aircraft to operate additional services or swap larger capacity aircraft such our Boeing 787 Dreamliner to operate flights instead of smaller planes where possible,” said a Jetstar spokesperson.\nHowever, additional flights are only possible if planes and crew are available to fly.\nCustomers are placed on flights according to priority with those who have been delayed the longest and those with extenuating circumstances the first to be allocated a flight.\nA Jetstar plane bound for Bali was grounded at Adelaide airport.

You can choose to delay your travel or choose a different destination as a result of the cancellations.\n“Jetstar is offering customers with bookings to Bali the option to change their holiday destination to any destination on its network. Jetstar will waive flight change fees for any customers with a valid booking to Bali between 8 July and 28 August, who wish to change their holiday destination. Fare differences may apply,” says the Jetstar website .\nACCOMMODATION\nIt’s not only flights that are affected, your accommodation the other end is too. So what can you do? It all comes down to travel insurance according to Tom Walley, Head of Flight Centre Australia.\n“The right travel insurance policy will ensure you are covered for your lost accommodation, which means your travel agent can work with you to extend or re-book your accommodation in Bali.\n“The same goes for flights. The benefit of booking with a travel agent is that we’re focused on exploring alternative options to get you on your way asap and pending your travel insurance coverage, we can even re-book you with another carrier,” he told Escape .\nA flight board bears bad news for passengers waiting at the airport in Bali.

It’s a last-ditch effort, but the fine print may end up giving your situation a silver lining. And next time, don’t wait for a disaster to get cover for your travel.”\nFor now the airlines and Aussies heading to and from Bali hope the worst is over.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a", "http://www.jetstar.com/au/en/travel-alerts", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a&title=What+happens+when+your+flight+is+cancelled%3F", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a&h=What+happens+when+your+flight+is+cancelled%3F", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a", "http://www.flightcentre.com.au/", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=What+happens+when+your+flight+is+cancelled%3F&c=A+VOLCANIC+ash+cloud+hovering+over+Bali+caused+havoc+for+hundreds+of+Aussie+travellers+recently%2C+so+what+actually+happens+when+your+plane+is+grounded%3F&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/travel/world/the-bukit-peninsular-in-bali-the-home-of-uber-luxury-resorts/story-fnjjvbm4-1227394433544", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/what-to-expect-when-your-flight-is-cancelled-following-the-bali-volcanic-ash-delays/story-fn6yjmoc-1227478977479?sv=6f326680d28ea4516708b8b21c50412a&title=What+happens+when+your+flight+is+cancelled%3F", "http://www.finder.com.au/travel-insurance"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:58:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
