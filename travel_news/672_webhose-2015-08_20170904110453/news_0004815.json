Prices for suppliers will start at £395 to match the high demand on budgets around the busy event season, ETOA tour operator members will attend free of charge. Martine Ainsworth-Wells, Director of Marketing & Commerce at ETOA said: “Britain & Ireland Marketplace has a proven track record in creating new business for suppliers from across the UK and Ireland, this is their opportunity to engage with operators who sell to domestic clients as well as those from the rest of Europe and around the world. The refreshed Britain & Ireland Marketplace will build on past achievements and ETOA, along with our partners, will continue to provide a forum for efficient and worthwhile business networking”.
