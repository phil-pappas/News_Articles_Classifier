Playtech said in April it had hired an extra 600 staff to work on this “omni-channel” business. \n“We have an organic revenue growth target of 15 per cent a year,” said Mor Weizer, the chief executive, as the group reported first-half figures. “Between 5 and 10 per cent of that will be from omni-channel — it is very important.” \nPlaytech helped Gala Coral to introduce the Coral Connect card, which allowed customers to bet online or on phones and collect their winnings in shops. In its first 12 months, more than 200,000 people signed up for the card. \n“There is a real opportunity in replicating some of the things we have done with Coral,” said Mr Weizer, adding that Playtech has already had discussions with retail gambling companies including William Hill , Betfred, Paddy Power and Ladbrokes . “I know from conversations I had with these operators that they noticed the success of Coral and they understand the opportunity.” \nHe said Ladbrokes, after it merges with Coral , will introduce a similar system within six to 12 months, while it will become standard across the industry in the next two to four years. Integrating the various gaming systems also allows companies to gather more information on their customers and provide targeted offers. \n“It will be difficult for anyone to do it without us. One company out there claims to have an omni-channel approach but you have not seen the numbers flowing through in the results,” he said.
