Less than a year after the central government lifted a 14-year ban on the products, industry insiders say sales figures have been disappointing. Sony and Microsoft, the biggest players in television-based game consoles, saw a rise in their stock prices after receiving licences in 2014 to sell the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, respectively, on the mainland. Both companies entered the market knowing they needed to play catch-up with PC-based games, which have dominated for years, while analysts warned that a major challenge would also come from the growing popularity of games for smartphones and tablets.

Market intelligence firm Niko Partners forecast in its Chinese TV-Based Gaming Report that only 550,000 units of PS4 and Xbox One combined would be legally sold in China this year. (Despite the ban, Chinese consumers have been able to purchase consoles illegally for some time, which may dilute any sales data.) By the end of June, sales had reached a disappointing 300,000, far below expectations, said Zeng Xiaofeng, a senior analyst for Niko Partners, in an interview with news and research website Venture Beat. Phil Spencer, corporate vicepresident of Microsoft Studios, which oversees products such as the Xbox One, was optimistic when he visited Shanghai for ChinaJoy 2015, a major annual digital entertainment expo that ran from July 30 to Aug 2. I predict a global hit created in China... I want Xbox and Windows to provide the platforms He insisted that the way to increase sales was to make great titles available to Chinese consumers, such as the latest instalment of its biggest franchise, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which was released for Xbox One on the mainland on Aug 13. He said the company is also hoping to release Minecraft, another global best-seller, on the mainland soon. “As our game portfolio strengthens, so will the sales of Xbox consoles in China,” he predicted. “The rest of this year will be great for games on Xbox.” As of July, roughly 300,000 games compatible with the PS4 or Xbox One had been sold in the first half of this year, according to a joint report by consultants International Data Corp and the Game Publishing Commission, an industry organisation in China. This puts sales at less than 100 million yuan (£10.1 million), far short of the 21 billion yuan generated by the mobile games sector. China’s industry watchdog, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, strictly checks the content of all imported console games and some have complained that the approval process can be slow, which has limited the number of games on the market. People here grew up playing games. It’s who they are. They understand what makes a good game To avoid this problem and ensure the long-term success of game consoles, analysts agree that developers in China and abroad need to make great games that are specific to Chinese gamers and culturally relevant. “There are many gamers in China,” said Mr Spencer. “Meeting with independent developers, I have come to know that people here have grown up playing games. It’s who they are. They understand what makes a good game. “I predict that we will see in the next couple of years a global hit that is created in China, and I want Xbox and Windows to provide the platforms to reach a global audience.” China has no shortage of game developers, so the signs are positive. BesTV New Media Co, a subsidiary of the state-affiliated Shanghai Media Group that handles PS4 and Xbox One sales on the mainland, has announced plans to release 100 new Chinese games every year alone. But will such efforts be enough to help game consoles take a greater share of a video game market that, by the latest official count, was worth 60.5 billion yuan? “We’re still beginning here,” said Mr Spencer. “If we started to judge our success in China on the first nine months (since the device was officially released) that would be too short for anybody to assess if we had built our market or made all the right moves.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:32:14.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
