Scott Darling III to be the next Administrator of FMCSA. ABA is pleased to see that a decision has been made to fill this vital role and provide the necessary leadership and stability for our nation’s foremost transportation safety agency.\n“During his time as FMCSA’s Acting Administrator and as Chief Counsel, Scott Darling has worked hard to reach out to ABA and the entire motorcoach industry. Mr. Darling has always had an open door, and he’s encouraged us to contact him regularly, whenever we have had concerns,” said ABA President and CEO Peter Pantuso. “Just a few months ago, he came to ABA’s spring Board of Directors meeting in Washington D.C., where he listened to our board members and took questions. We found his answers to be straight forward, and we are looking forward to working with him in the future.”\nFMCSA is the federal agency that motorcoach operators interact with the most frequently. Having a leader in place, who is familiar with our industry, who understands the nature of the precious cargo that we carry, and who recognizes that regulators must partner with the industry to achieve safety outcomes will only help make the safest mode of surface transportation even safer.\nABA and Mr. Darling have a shared vision of safety, and safety is always the highest priority for our industry, as motorcoaches provide more than 600 million passenger trips each year.\nSource:- American Bus Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:01:42.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
