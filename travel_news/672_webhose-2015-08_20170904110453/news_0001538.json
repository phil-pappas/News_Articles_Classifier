News Corp Australia 10 Aug 2015 News Strange debris ... Material collected from the Maldives which locals suspect may be from MH370. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nTHERE is no way debris being found in the Maldives could be from MH370 if the flaperon found on Reunion Island is definitely from the missing aircraft, an oceanography expert says. \nA range of unidentified items, including a large piece of panelling, has been collected by locals from the Maldives’ northern atolls in recent weeks, and Malaysia has made a formal request to Maldivians to assist in the search. \nBut University of Western Australia oceanography expert Charitha Pattiaratchi said the collected items now being stored for testing could not have come from the southern Indian Ocean. \n“If the debris originated from where we’re talking about in the southern hemisphere, none of it actually goes northwards,” said Prof Pattiaratchi. \n“It can’t cross the hemispheres because of the wind and the current patterns.” Odd object ... A piece found in the Maldives that will be tested by Malaysia hoping to find more MH370 debris. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied Mystery debris ... Items Maldivians believe may be from MH370.

If Reunion stuff belongs to #MH370 , can’t be north AND south of equator. #MH370 — Mike Chillit (@MikeChillit) August 9, 2015 \nHe said it would be very difficult to explain how debris from MH370 ended up on Reunion Island as well as the Maldives . \n“It would be a big conundrum to see stuff in Reunion as well as Maldives. It could not have originated from MH370 in both cases,” Prof Pattiaratchi said. \nAlmost as confounding was the claim a flaperon that Malaysia has confirmed as from MH370, may have washed on to Reunion Island as early as May. \nThe item was only handed to police on July 29 after beach worker Johnny Begue thought it seemed a “bit special”. Unlikely hero ... Reunion Island Beach cleaner Johny Begue found the flaperon Malaysia has confirmed is from MH370. Picture: Cameron Richardson/News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nProf Pattiaratchi said doubt about the timing made it harder to define the search area. \n“If you don’t even know the date when it washed up on the beach, you don’t know what currents it was subjected to,” he said. \n“Two months is a very long window.” \nBut he remained of the opinion that the search area being scoured by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau was the right one. \nSuggestions MH370 ditched further north would have meant any debris washed up on Reunion Island before Christmas, Prof Pattiaratchi said.
