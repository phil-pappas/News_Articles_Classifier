We are also thrilled to have Wither Hills join our wine partnership in 2015 for the first time.”\n“Victoria Wines was a fantastic partner at our 2014 event. They added the finer touches to our event functions and corporate hospitality areas with the supply of their exclusive wines. We are very excited to have them back on board as a partner at the 2015 Fiji International and look forward to further leveraging their brand association with Fiji’s biggest sporting event.”, said Matt Porm, Head of Commercial for the Fiji International.\nWither Hills have indicated their excitement to be a part of the Fiji International Golf Tournament being held at the Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course later in October this year – “Wither Hills has a strong association with sport being the official wine of the All Blacks, so supporting the Fiji International golf tournament was an easy decision and an important part of our brand positioning in Fiji.”\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:31:11.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
