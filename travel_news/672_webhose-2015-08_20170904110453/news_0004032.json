Located in the north west of the island on idyllic Punta Bunga Beach, famed for its white powdery sand and aquamarine waters and considered one of Asia’s luxury resort hotspots, the upscale 333-key property will start welcoming guests in December 2015. \nThe property will not only shore up Mövenpick’s presence in the Philippines, where it already manages Mövenpick Hotel Mactan Island Cebu, but also bolster the hospitality firm’s portfolio of resort properties in top Asian locations. In Thailand the company operates two resorts in Phuket and one on Koh Samui, while construction is underway on properties in leisure destinations such as Pattaya, Thailand, Quy Nhon, Vietnam and Bali, Indonesia. “Signing a property in Boracay is a significant development for Mövenpick, as it cements our presence in one of Asia’s most established resort destinations,” explains Andreas Mattmüller, Chief Operating Officer, Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts, Middle East and Asia. “Punta Bunga Beach, with its crystal-clear waters and soft white sand, is unspoiled and truly idyllic, attracting discerning travellers from all over the world from both the upscale leisure and corporate meetings segments.” Mattmüller also notes how the Filipino culture marries well with Mövenpick’s ‘We make moments’ guest promise, which guides the hospitality firm’s service ethics world over. “The Filipinos have a happy attitude towards life; in the Philippines you will always receive a warm welcome,” he adds. Mövenpick Resort Boracay will comprise a cluster of three buildings nestled around the lagoon pool with most of the resort’s rooms and suites boasting sea views. Designed to give guests the ultimate luxury experience, the Presidential Suite will be housed in a stand-alone villa, featuring two bedrooms and a private pool. Key resort features will include family rooms; a kids club for young children and a games area for teens; and several dining outlets including Italian, Japanese and Korean restaurants plus a lobby lounge, beach club and swim-up pool bar. Meetings and events facilities will span a ballroom that can accommodate up to 450 guests for a seated dinner, three multi-function rooms and a boardroom. The property’s owner, Ambassador Alfredo Yao, who is also the founder and owner of the Philippines’ largest beverage producer, Zest-O and a partner in AirAsia Zest, Philippines, says signing the management agreement with Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts marks the start of a “new exciting era” for the resort. “The rebranding of Sol Marina as Mövenpick Resort Boracay will mark a new beginning for our beautiful property, steered by the capable team at Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts, which has a formidable reputation as one of Asia’s top resort operators,” says Yao.
