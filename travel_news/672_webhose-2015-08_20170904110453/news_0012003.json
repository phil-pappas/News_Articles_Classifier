Whose members--10 black women and one white woman--included an 85-year-old with mobility challenges? \nIt appears they were laughing and talking too loud for the liking of some of the other passengers. The train staff asked the women three times to reduce their volume. The maitre d' informed them that since they were still too loud, they would have to get off. \nWhen the train pulled into St. Helena, the cops were waiting for them. The officers remained on the scene until a taxi came to pick the women up. How's that for a nice relaxing afternoon in Napa wine country? \nLisa Renee Johnson, the book club's leader, who detailed the incident on Facebook, is convinced her group was singled out because of their race. The wine train management denies any racial bias. Yet I can't help but wonder, would the maitre d' have been so quick to eject an octogenarian passenger who resembled say, Sen. Dianne Feinstein? \nThe ugly episode has been a public-relations nightmare for the wine train, a popular tourist attraction. People have threatened to boycott. Some have taken to Yelp to bash the company. There is an online petition with 14,000 signatures that demanded the CEO apologize to the women. Advertisement \nThe company initially stuck to its guns, claiming that the train staff acted appropriately. But on Tuesday, CEO Anthony Giaccio issued a statement saying that the Napa Valley Wine Train had been \"100 percent wrong.\" He offered the women an all-expenses paid return visit for up to 50 people. He also called Johnson Monday evening to apologize. \nJohnson told this newspaper that the apology couldn't undo the traumatic experience and that her group would almost certainly not be returning to the train. \nThe company has only itself to blame for the fiasco. \nFirst off, a group of 11 people--unless they are monks on a silent meditation--are going to make noise. The book club informed the wine train staff that they were going to be a large group. It was the company's responsibility, as the CEO noted in his apology, to seat the women where they could be free to enjoy themselves. \nSecond, so long as people are not shrieking at the top of their lungs or behaving like rowdy belligerent drunks, an experienced train staff ought to know how to diffuse conflicts over noise levels without resorting to such drastic measures. \nBear in mind, we're not talking about a wild and crazy bachelorette party or a group of college students on Spring Break. \nThird, the wine train management exacerbated the first blunder by falsely accusing the women of being verbally and physically abusive to staff and passengers on the company Facebook site. That post that was later deleted and the company CEO apologized for publicizing the erroneous information. \nNapa Valley Wine Train may have \"wine\" in the name. However, it is not as Johnson called it, \"a bar on wheels.\" \nThe ambience is more country club than neighborhood pub. Adults pay $124 for the early Saturday train made up of restored Pullman cars. For that hefty price, you get the privilege of eating not great food and drinking passable wine on white tablecloths. \nI took my grandmother a number of years ago. She liked it, but it wasn't an experience I would repeat. \nBecause of the staid d√©cor and cost, some passengers expect near silence. But this isn't the opera or a movie theater where convention demands that one sit quietly like a church mouse. Some people pay their money and want to have a little more boisterous fun. Why should the desires of the first group supersede those of the second? \nPerhaps the wine train should consider instituting quiet and fun cars to help avoid more unhappy campers in the future.
