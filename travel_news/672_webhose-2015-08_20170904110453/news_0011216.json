Dreaming ... Holidays are top of mind Monday mornings when people would rather be on vacation than working. Picture: ThinkStock Source: Supplied \nAUSTRALIANS spend an average of just 14 minutes booking a holiday online, and are most likely to do so at work first thing on a Monday. \nResearch undertaken by travel search engine kayak.com.au found Los Angeles was the most popular destination for Aussies using the site, followed by Melbourne, London, Sydney and Bali. \nThe Mobile Traveller Report also found we tend to spend more on travel when using a desktop computer, as opposed to an iPhone or Android phone. \nThe average cost of a booking via a phone was $1233, compared with $1352 on a desktop. \nKayak Asia Pacific Vice-President Debby Soo said the research was undertaken to help understand how Australians booked travel, and to identify ways to improve the search engine. \n“For example, we see that a lot of iPhone users in Australia have a preference for five-star hotels,” said Ms Soo. \n“So in future when I present a list of hotels to Australian travellers using iPhones, I’m going to put more five-star hotels on the first page because that’s what I know they’re most interested in.” \nOn the other hand Android users tended to book faster, so Kayak would look at streamlining the booking process to make it more efficient, Ms Soo said.

All of it is data driven,” she said. \nSimilar research undertaken in other countries revealed key differences between Australian travellers, and those in the UK, US and Singapore. \n“The first thing that surprised me was the list of top destinations Australians are searching for, are a very long way away, which is different to every other country,” said Ms Soo. \n“For the US a lot of the destinations are domestic, and for other countries too, the most searched destinations are close by.” \nThe speed at which potential travellers made bookings was also a surprise, with Android users taking a mere four minutes to book flights, and iPhone users five minutes. \nHotel bookings did not take much longer — averaging seven minutes for iPhone operators, and eight minutes for Android users. \nDesktop users averaged nine minutes for flight bookings and the same for hotel bookings, and spent nearly ten per cent more. \n“I think people are generally more comfortable (when using a desktop),” Ms Soo said. \n“You can see the information more clearly because of the size of the screen, the results are very clear on the left side but over time people will get more comfortable booking and doing things on their phone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:14:27.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
