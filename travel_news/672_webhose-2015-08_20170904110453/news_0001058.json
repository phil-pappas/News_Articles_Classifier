(Morgan Hotels Group) By Mary Forgione \nThe Hudson New York near Central Park is having one of those anniversary flash sales with impossible-to-beat prices. The hotel in a vintage building turns 15 this year, so it's giving away 15 stays for $15 a night. \nIt's also giving out 95 stays at its 2000 opening price of $95 a night. (As a comparison, I checked online and found midweek rates in August for a standard room start at $239 a night, plus taxes and fees.)

(Morgan Hotels Group) \nThere are blackout dates and other caveats that come with the online-only sale. But if you're lucky, you may snag a standard room when the sale begins at 9:01 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday (that's a stroke after midnight Thursday on the East Coast). \nThe Hudson , less than a block from Columbus Circle, started out as the American Women's Assn. Clubhouse in 1928. It has been many things since then, including a Henry Hudson Hotel in 1941, a place where Dutch soldiers were housed during World War II and the home of Sesame Street Studios in 1985. \nIan Schrager and designer Philippe Starck had a hand in making over the hotel, which was purchased by the Morgans Hotel Group in 1997. \nIt's perhaps best known for its period design, the glow of chartreuse-colored lights that guide you up a 30-foot escalator, and the Sky Terrace with views on the 15th floor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:10:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
