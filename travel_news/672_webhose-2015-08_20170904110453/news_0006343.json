(Matthew Stockman/Getty Images) UFC bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey will fight Brazilian challenger Bethe Correia in UFC 190 in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. Both are undefeated. Mixed martial arts Rousey fights Saturday in Rio \nUnbeaten bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey is perhaps the biggest star on the Ultimate Fighting Championship circuit, and she could have staged her next title defense in friendly confines before she moves on to her next acting job or book-tour stop or red-carpet appearance. \nRousey decided to fight Brazilian challenger Bethe Correia in UFC 190 at a raucous arena in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. \n“When I don’t have the home-court advantage, that’s another thing that really keeps me motivated,” said Rousey, who hasn’t fought outside Las Vegas or her native Southern California in three years. \nAfter the trash-talking Correia infuriated her with a flippant comment she thought referenced Rousey’s father’s suicide, Rousey decided to beat Correia in the most painful, humiliating way possible. That meant fighting in Correia’s home country.

My father will be with me the day I hand you the comeuppance you deserve.” \nCorreia, 32, apologized, saying she wasn’t aware of the suicide. \nWith an upcoming role in a Mark Wahlberg film and soaring international popularity, Rousey welcomes the spotlight. \n“Here’s pretty much the plan: I’m going to beat up Bethe,” Rousey said. “Then I’m going to take a couple of weeks to rest. And then I’m going to go beat up Miesha (Tate, her likely next opponent, who is from Tacoma). And then I’m going to go to Thailand, or wherever we decide to film. I’m going to prep for a month and start filming for eight to 10 weeks, and then go beat up the next chick.” \nAll but one of Rousey’s bouts have ended in the first round. Obituary WWE legend Piper dies \n“Rowdy” Roddy Piper, the kilt-wearing trash-talker who headlined the first WrestleMania and later found movie stardom, died Friday. He was 61. \nThe WWE confirmed the death but provided no additional details. \nPiper, born Roderick Toombs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is the second WWE Hall of Famer to die this summer. \nDusty Rhodes died in June. Piper’s death also comes days after Hulk Hogan, his biggest rival for decades, was fired by the WWE. Hogan had used racial slurs in a conversation captured on a sex tape. \nPiper and Hogan battled for years and headlined some of the biggest matches during the 1980s. Hogan and Mr. T beat Piper and Paul Orndorff on March 31, 1985, at the first WrestleMania, which was at Madison Square Garden in New York. Auto racing Busch to start from pole \nKyle Busch will start his drive for his fourth straight NASCAR Sprint Cup Series victory from the front of the field. \nBusch turned a lap of 178.416 mph at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pa., to win the pole for Sunday’s race. \nBusch missed the first 11 races of the season with a broken right leg and broken left foot. He returned in late May and has won three consecutive races at NASCAR’s highest level. \nBusch is trying to become the first Cup driver since Jimmie Johnson in 2007 to win four straight races. \nKevin Harvick was second in qualifying. Kasey Kahne of Enumclaw will start in 16th and Greg Biffle of Vancouver, Wash., will start in 25th. ELSEWHERE \n• The NCAA was given a respite when the 9th U.S. Circuit Court delayed the implementation of possible payments to athletes for the use of their names, images and likenesses. \nThe stay in the Ed O’Bannon case allows schools to withhold payments of roughly $5,000 in deferred money to football and basketball players, which were expected to begin Saturday as part of the landmark ruling handed down by U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken last summer. \nThe decision will stand until the appeals court rules on the full case. Former UCLA basketball standout O’Bannon won his antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA last August after claiming the organization was using the names, images and likenesses of college athletes to profit commercially without compensating the athletes. \n• The Phoenix Suns added former NBA players Earl Watson — a former Sonic — and Corey Gaines — a Sonics draftee who didn’t play for Seattle — as assistants on Jeff Hornacek ’s coaching staff.
