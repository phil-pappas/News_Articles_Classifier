Both sides need to be confident that they’re working to achieve similar goals. The initial steps in any relationship can give a good guide as to how the future might look - almost like first dates, they’re about getting to know each other, finding out if you want the same things, and seeing if you can build that all-important trust. \nUnfortunately, there’s no Match.com around for travel companies, and, just like personal relationships, business partnerships can flounder. Nothing destroys our trust more than starting a new relationship with a company which does all the taking… only to head off into the sunset to work with other companies when success strikes. It’s a short-term outlook, and one that’s seldom sustainable. If that success starts to wane, it’s a sure bet that they’ll pop up again - but by that time, we’ve moved on ourselves. \nThe old saying about being kind to everyone on the way up, as you might need them on the way down, holds true - a relationship without mutual loyalty is going nowhere. \nI’m pleased to say that Barrhead Travel has, over the years, forged many very valued relationships with a hugely diverse range of organisations. We’re in it for the long term, and put flexible strategies in place which allow for growth. We learn so much from our partners, and we also teach them, so it’s a two-way street. \nMuch like any romantic relationship, there has to be some sort of chemistry there to make it work. Some partnerships can be a slow burn, yet mutual respect, two-way honest exchanges of views, common values and good old-fashioned hard work tend to lead to long-term partnerships. We’ve forged fantastic tie-ups with so many organisations, from major companies to charities, and we value each and every partner we have. \nThe pros of being in a real partnership are many and varied, and the cons are few. The one thing all of our partner companies have in common, though, is that we trust each of them to echo Barrhead’s own brand values. \nYou’re known by the company you keep, they say, and we are very proud to be associated with so many quality organisations. We know that we gain strength as a result of working together as a team to attain the same goals. We’d never succeed without their support, and we make sure that having Barrhead as their partner brings unique benefits to their organisations too. \nWe count ourselves lucky to have so many perfect business partnership matches at Barrhead. And we can confirm that Barrhead prides itself on building long-term, meaningful relationships - anyone looking for a one-night stand need not apply. \nSharon Munro is chief executive of Barrhead Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:09:00.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
