Sven Hagemeier kept his 26th birthday going for 46 hours by flying from Auckland in New Zealand , to Brisbane , Australia , before travelling backwards in time across the International Date Line to Hawaii. The German's journey won him the Guinness World Record for the “Longest birthday” ever, beating a previous time of 35 hours and 25 minutes. On the downside, Sven's celebration may have been tainted by spending most of the elongated party eating airline food, struggling to stay comfortable in a plane seat, and admiring a fairly non-descript view through a small window. However, he did find time to take a short tour of Auckland with a taxi driver named Khan who showed him the city’s highlights in 90 minutes: “You will get help, wherever you are in this world,” Sven said. Sven didn't have much time for sightseeing on his birthday journey, but did take a taxi tour of Auckland, New Zealand (Getty) He began his record-setting journey in Auckland, before setting off for Brisbane , which is two hours behind. From there, he caught a plane to Honolulu, the capital of Hawaii, 20 hours behind the Australian city. The record, of course, only makes sense considering the time in different timezones and how it elongated the date of his birthday - in reality, the actual duration of his journey is much shorter than 46 hours, amassing only about 13 hours and 10 minutes in the air. • 11 cruise ship world records Sven said that he was a “huge fan” of Guinness World Records: “I always asked myself if it would be possible to set a record myself. After I found the perfect record for me, I felt confident I could become a record holder.” The record attempt took place last year, but it was only recently verified, after he provided tickets and evidence of the journey to Guinness World Records. Sven said that the highlight of his birthday trip was landing in Hawaii at midnight with his wife waiting to meet him, in the knowledge that he had \"celebrated\" a 46-hour birthday. • Quiz: how many travel world records can you guess?

Sven's protracted birthday celebrations beat the previous record set by Nargis Bhimji of Karachi, who celebrated her birthday for 35 and a half hours by crossing time zones after flying from the Pakistani city to Singapore and then to San Francisco in June 1998. The time difference in the South Pacific is not just used for birthday world records. In 2013, private jet company Privatefly.com offered a trip that allowed passengers to see in 2014 twice. The itinerary took in the New Year in Sydney before flying revellers to Los Angeles, moving back in time across the International Date Line to celebrate again in the USA.
