These were the talking points on day three.\n1. CHANGES FOR TRENT BRIDGE\nENG 2/102 \"Four, five and six are a major problem.\" - Tubby on @CricketAus middle order. 19 to win. #Ashes #WWOS pic.twitter.com/z921DZfNiW\n— Wide World of Sports (@WWOS9) July 31, 2015 IAN Healy and Mark Taylor have suggested some interesting changes to the Australian batting order for the fourth Ashes Test.\nDiscussing what the Aussies should do at selection ahead of next week’s match at Trent Bridge, both appeared to indicate that Adam Voges’s time was up.\nVoges has scores of 31, 1, 25, 16 and 0 in the series. He’s not performing any worse than Michael Clarke and Mitch Marsh but is the most vulnerable because of his age — and unlike Clarke he’s not the captain. “There’s big chat Smith to four, Clarke to five, maybe Shaun Marsh in at three,” Healy said.\nBut Taylor disagreed. “No, I like Steve Smith at number three,” he said. “He’s missed out twice here in this Test match but last Test match he set up the game batting at number three. He made 200. He stays there. Maybe a Shaun Marsh in at number four.”\nAustralia is unlikely to make any changes to its bowling line-up, which performed well enough to restrict England to 281 in its first innings.\n2. CATCHES WIN MATCHES\nJoe Root catches Josh Hazlewood rocket 0:46 Play video\nCricket: England's Joe Root takes a spectular catch to dismiss Australia's Josh Hazlewood for 11.\nFox Sports 31 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes/Highlights IT wasn’t the difference in the final result but Joe Root and Michael Clarke highlighted the importance of holding catches on day three.\nRoot plucked a one-handed beauty at third slip to remove Josh Hazlewood for 11 after the tailender had helped push Australia’s lead past triple figures.\nClarke couldn’t match the effort during the English run chase, dropping Ian Bell at second slip when he was on 20. Bell finished the innings 65 not out.\nhttp://t.co/NHz0jfW8ua 's page not found page is looking quite apt...

Source: AFP\nSHANE Warne was critical of Michael Clarke’s decision to open the bowling with Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood — and not Mitchell Johnson — in the second innings.\nDefending just 121 runs, Johnson wasn’t introduced into the attack until the ninth over when England was already 1/47.\nClarke obviously wanted to bowl Johnson from the same end as Starc — whose first spell netted the wicket of Alastair Cook. But given Johnson’s success in the first innings, Warne believed he should have been thrown the ball first.\n“I just think when you’re defending 121 runs and the way Mitchell Johnson has a spell on a few of the English batsmen ... just to set the tone first up,” Warne said. “You see what he did yesterday in his first over — he took two wickets in his first over. I just wonder if Michael Clarke’s missed a trick by not opening the bowling with him.”\n4. ANDERSON OUT FOR TRENT BRIDGE\nWas this the last time James Anderson touched the leather in the series? Source: AFP\nENGLAND pace ace James Anderson has been ruled out of the fourth Test in a major boost to Australia’s hopes of levelling the series at Trent Bridge.\nAnderson badly strained his side while bowling late on day two and took no part in the match on day three.\n“Obviously it’s going to be a big loss for them, but we’ve seen what Steven Finn can do,” Aussie batsman David Warner said. “Look what he did (on day two), produced a fantastic spell. We know what Woody (Mark Wood) is capable of as well, so they’ve got bowling stocks.\n“For us, we’ve got to worry about scoring runs. What happens in their camp is in their camp.”\nStuart Broad tells Sky that Anderson will miss Trent Bridge but is very hopeful he'll be back for 5th #Ashes Test @surreycricket #Ashes2015\n— CricketBadger (@cricket_badger) July 31, 2015 5.
