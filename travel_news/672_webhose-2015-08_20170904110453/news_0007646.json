The structure for Economy Class includes Economy Breaking Deals, Economy Saver, Economy Value and Economy Freedom. Business Class includes Business Breaking Deals, Business Saver and Business Freedom, while in First Class there will only be one ‘fare family’ – Freedom. \nThe Gulf carrier has also changed its excess baggage policy with cost of purchasing additional 23kg piece of luggage reduced by up to 90 per cent on some routes, with a further reduction of up to 30 per cent if pre-purchased directly with Etihad. \nEtihad Airways COO Peter Baumgartner said: “In most industries there is a move towards allowing customers to tailor and customise their experience, and ours is no different. When it comes to booking a flight, not everyone’s needs are the same. \n“Some guests want to travel light and on a budget, while others want to be able to make last-minute travel decisions, carry extra baggage or earn more miles. For example, if a guest wants more flexibility, more luggage, and priority check in, they can select our Economy Freedom Fare Choice.” \nThe new fare structure will be available through all of Etihad’s booking channels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:00:39.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
