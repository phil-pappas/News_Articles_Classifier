The index's top riser was gambling house Ladbrokes (Amsterdam: LB6.AS - news ) , which was up by 4.39%. The company was still waiting for its Â£2.3 billion merger with Gala Coral to get final approval from the UK Competition and Markets Authority. Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) was scheduled to present interim results next week. \nBudget airline Wizz Air Holdings was up by 3.97% after the company posted improved passenger figures for the month of June. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in shipping company Clarkson (LSE: CKN.L - news ) also rose as analysts at Nomura initiated coverage of the stock with a 'buy' rating. \nGoing the other way Spirax-Sarco Engineering was the index's biggest loser after the company said a slowdown in global industrial production dragged down pre-tax profit. \nThe company which fell by 5.61% said it incurred costs associated with the start-up of its business in India and with the restructuring of its UK operations. \nRotork (LSE: ROR.L - news ) dropped again after the company produced poor figures on Tuesday. The company, which makes electric, pneumatic and hydraulic valves would have suffered by Spirax's result as well, as it has just purchased M&M International from Spirax. Both Credit Suiss e and JP Morgan cut ratings for this Rotork on Wednesday as well. \nFTSE 250 - Risers Ladbrokes (LAD) 111.70p +4.39% Wizz Air Holdings (WIZZ) 1,756.00p +4.15% Just Retirement Group (JRG) 201.80p +3.97% Fisher (James) & Sons (FSJ) 1,144.00p +3.06% Clarkson (CKN) 2,799.00p +2.68% Enterprise Inns (LSE: ETI.L - news ) (ETI) 115.40p +2.58% Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 405.50p +2.40% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 517.00p +2.38% IP Group (LSE: IPO.L - news ) (IPO) 214.30p +2.29% Vesuvius (VSVS) 416.70p +2.23% FTSE 250 - Fallers Spirax-Sarco Engineering (SPX) 3,199.00p -5.61% Rotork (Frankfurt: RO41.F - news ) (ROR) 214.80p -3.24% Greggs (GRG) 1,282.00p -2.88% Foxtons Group (LSE: FOXT.L - news ) (FOXT) 236.20p -2.32% Essentra (ESNT) 919.00p -2.23% Hunting (Frankfurt: 0YT.F - news ) (HTG) 490.60p -2.08% Just Eat (Other OTC: JSTLF - news ) (JE.) 414.40p -2.03% DCC (Frankfurt: DCC.F - news ) (DCC (LSE: DCC.L - news ) ) 4,958.00p -2.02% Countrywide (CWD) 505.50p -1.75% SIG (Stuttgart: QIG.SG - news ) (SHI) 203.00p -1.55%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:22:56.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
