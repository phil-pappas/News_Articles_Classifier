(Courtesy of MSP) \nThree small fishing boats — two of them illegally transporting tourists — have been seized in Pacific waters so far this week by Costa Rican Coast Guard officers. \nThe Public Security Ministry ( MSP ) in a news release said the Coast Guard had increased patrols along the Pacific coast in recent days following reports of several small fishing boats offering trips to tourists without a valid permit. \nCommercial and artisanal fishing boats usually do not have the infrastructure for transporting additional passengers. They often lack minimum security measures, like lifejackets for all passengers and radios for emergency communication. Many don’t have any insurance policy. \nOne of the boats seized was transporting 18 tourists near Tambor Bay on the Nicoya Peninsula. The boat’s owner showed officers a navigation permit for a different boat. The boat in use did not display the boat’s name or registration number and the engines weren’t the same as those described in the license, according to the Coast Guard report. \nAnother boat identified as Capitán Walker was abandoned by its captain in front of Tortuga Island in the Gulf of Nicoya. The official report says the captain jumped into the water and ran toward the beach as soon as he noticed the Coast Guard speedboat. \nNeither of these boats had authorization to be in the areas where they were seized. Both were taken to the Coast Guard station in the Port of Caldera. \nCoast Guard officers noted that boats like the ones seized generally can only navigate safely within three miles of the coastline, however some have been detected up to 26 miles offshore, frequently transporting passengers beyond their capacity. \nIn May, four people died off Golfito, in the southern Pacific, when the fishing boat they were on capsized, apparently because it was overloaded, Coast Guard reported at the time. \nA third vessel transporting two tourists was seized Wednesday off Quepos, in the southern Pacific, after a Coast Guard inspection found that the boat’s captain was wanted by a criminal court in Osa on murder charges. The man, who’s last name is Marchena, was taken to a local Judicial Investigation Police precinct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:50:01.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
