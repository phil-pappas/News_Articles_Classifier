Now, business or tourist visa holders, Mexican travelers with border crossing cards, and airline crew members will be able to use the kiosks upon arrival in the U.S.\nRosemary Vassiliadis, Clark County Director of Aviation, said: “McCarran welcomed nearly 43 million travelers in 2014 – the most since 2008 – with much of that growth coming from outside the U.S. We expect the volume of international travel will continue to rise, and offering the speed and convenience of SITA’s APC self-service kiosks for passport processing to a greater number of travelers will allow us to accommodate that growth while continuing to deliver an exceptional guest experience.”\nMcCarran first deployed SITA’s APC Kiosks in March, increasing efficiency at the border by allowing passengers to provide their travel document, biometric data and customs declaration prior to speaking to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer. Phase 4.0 increases eligibility from the previously established 38 “visa waiver” countries outlined by Customs and Border Protection to virtually all of McCarran’s international arrivals.\nBeyond extending eligibility to a greater number of travelers, the Phase 4 SITA kiosks feature enhanced embedded video, making it simpler and more intuitive for first-time users, and consistent with the Global Entry experience.\nPaul Houghton, SITA President, Americas, said: “SITA is helping airports worldwide deliver an end-to-end, hassle-free and secure passenger journey. Whether at check-in or upon arrival, automating routine and often time-consuming processes like passport control has proven to significantly cut wait times, enabling airports to improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. In the U.S. our automated passport control kiosks have reduced wait times for passengers by as much as 40 percent.”\nThe need for more efficient and secure border processing will likely continue, as the National Travel and Tourism Office projects nearly six percent annual growth rates in international visitor volume to the U.S. over the 2014-2019 timeframe. Phase 4.0 will allow travelers from the countries with the largest total growth percentages – China (172%), Colombia (72%), India (47%), Brazil (43%), and Mexico (38%) – to process themselves through the kiosks.\nSITA is a world leader in providing border control technology and has developed its border control solutions in close collaboration with border agency partners worldwide, as well as airlines, airports and industry groups. SITA’s iBorders ® portfolio provides the air transport community with a complete set of capabilities to transform border security and facilitate the travel experience through information, intelligence, optimized interactions with passengers and comprehensive insights to enhance every aspect of border operations.\nMore than 30 governments globally use SITA’s iBorders ® systems and capabilities to keep their borders secure and transform their border security operations. Many international airports in the USA, including JFK New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Diego and Tampa, have biometric immigration kiosks provided by SITA.\nSource:- SITA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:47:53.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
