We at Bag Concern are disturbed by these findings. Our own studies suggest that bag hoarding is particularly prevalent among the older middle classes. While we are all too aware of the young going out at night, throwing bags into hedges, strewing them around the streets outside nightclubs and vomiting into them, little attention is paid to the hidden problem occurring in apparently respectable homes. Middle-class people have bags stuffed under the sink, at the bottom of the vegetable rack and under the stairs and they still do not admit that they have bag issues . At Bag Concern, we suggest that five is the maximum safe number in a hoard and if you have more than that you are classed as plastic-dependent. We are also troubled by the growing trend to promiscuity with bags for life. People think nothing of having two or even three of them without considering what harm this is doing to their relationships. It is wrong to think, if you have multiple bags for life , that you can “spice up” your shopping by experimenting with hessian. Ask your local refuse collector to refer you to a support group. The real danger in hoarding plastic bags is that it leads to other unhealthy habits . It is the slippery slope to drawers full of leftover Christmas wrapping paper, a dozen half-used rolls of Sellotape scattered around the house, an excess of drawing pins, a glut of silver foil and too many candles and AA batteries. If you feel you are affected by any of these issues, you can ring our helpline – or pull yourself together. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T10:45:42.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
