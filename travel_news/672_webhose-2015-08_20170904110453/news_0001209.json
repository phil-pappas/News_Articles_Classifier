For British holidaymakers, the favourable rate means everything will seem markedly cheaper.\nHowever, banks and bureaux de change impose various charges on obtaining foreign currency and using credit and debit cards when abroad.\nSo you need to play your cards right to reap as much benefit as possible.\nQuids in: The stronger pound will buy you more holiday euros this summer\nEuros before you go\nTo find the best rate, turn to travelmoneymax.com .
