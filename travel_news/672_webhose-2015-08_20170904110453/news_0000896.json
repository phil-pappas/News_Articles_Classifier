Windermere is the largest natural lake in England with morning mist rising in winter. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nI imagine Beatrix and William opening their curtains in the morning and reaching for pen or paintbrush, strolling country lanes and writing on summer nights when the setting sun drops a golden glow on the rural landscape that they see from study windows.\nBeatrix Potter\nThe author responsible for Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle-Duck and Benjamin Bunny discovered the Lake District during childhood holidays and moved to a working farm near Hawkshead in the early 1900s before shifting across the road to a larger house when she later wed local solicitor William Heelis.\nBeatrix Potter’s world ... was born at the famous Lake District. Picture: Visit Britain Source: Supplied\nI start my first full day in Hawkshead – the hamlet of white houses roughly halfway between Lake Windermere and Coniston Water – and visit the Beatrix Potter Museum now occupying the 17th-century building that served as husband William’s chambers.\nI linger in the dark rooms at the top of the narrow steps to peer at dainty original sketches and watercolour paintings featuring the author’s famous characters, read displays detailing her contribution to conservation and farming, and look out a window to spy the view Beatrix would have glimpsed while visiting her husband at work.\nThen it’s back in the car to drive the 4km to Hill Top, the farm Beatrix bought in 1906 and moved to after the death of her first fiance Norman Warne. The property is now managed by the National Trust and the cottage is in much the same condition as when the author left it.\nLiterary history ... Beatrix Potter's farmhouse where she created the Peter Rabbit tales. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThere’s the sitting room just inside the front door with a cabinet displaying her favourite plates, a rocking chair by the fireplace, the bedroom with a faded quilt and her glasses resting on a dressing table.\nOut in the garden I expect to see Peter Rabbit dash into the vegie patch as I stroll footpaths flanked by bushes with bright summertime blooms and linger at the front door to have my photo snapped in the exact spot I’ve seen the famous resident pose.\nAfter exploring the grounds, I retire to neighbouring Sawrey House for afternoon tea of scones and cool homemade lemonade, to linger just a little longer in Beatrix Potter territory.\nWilliam Wordsworth\nThe poet was educated in Hawkshead but his real passion for the district started in 1799 when he settled in Dove Cottage on the edge of Grasmere, the village he described as “the loveliest spot that man hath ever found’’, before briefly relocating to nearby Allan Bank and settling at Rydal Mount in 1813.\nI start a second literary day in Grasmere and skirt St Oswald’s Church to see the Wordsworth graves – William is buried in the yard beside wife Mary, sister Dorothy and daughter Nora – before pausing at Sarah Nelson’s Gingerbread Shop to try a local culinary icon in what was once the school where the poet taught local children.\nTranquil sights ... the Grasmere Gingerbread shop. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nIt’s an eight-minute walk to Dove Cottage where I join a tour of the rooms William and Dorothy occupied when they first moved to the Lakes before visiting the neighbouring Wordsworth Museum to see handwritten letters and diaries.\nI retreat to Grasmere for lunch, sitting on the riverside terrace at The Rowan Tree to gaze across the water at Wordsworth’s church while recharging for the afternoon, then it’s into the car for the 4km drive to Rydal Mount and the estate William lived at from 1813 until his death in 1850.\nHistorical place ... Wordsworth's Dove Cottage. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images\nThe property is still in the hands of Wordsworth descendants, who gather a couple of times a year for special occasions, but when they’re not in residence the stately dwelling is open to the public.\nOutside I drift through the garden, designed by the famous resident who surrounded himself with the natural environment that encouraged his work, to find Dora’s Field, the pasture William bought for his daughter and filled with daffodils after her death in 1847.\nThe writer was a guest of Visit England.\nGo2\nThe Lake District\nGETTING THERE\nLocated in England’s northwest corner and basically defined by the boundaries of Cumbria’s Lake District National Park, the Lake District is a 90-minute drive from Manchester or a two-hour journey on National Rail to Windermere. See nationalrail.co.uk\nSTAYING THERE\nLangdale Hotel & Spa, 7km from Ambleside near the hamlet of Elterwater, is a delightful place to stay in the Lake District with Waterside Rooms beside a cascading stream and the chefs at Purdey’s restaurant using local ingredients to create a fine-dining experience.
