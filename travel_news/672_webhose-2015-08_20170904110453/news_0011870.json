Dublin was cheaper than other popular cultural destinations such as Prague, Budapest and Warsaw, which had previously been touted as cheap cities for cultural tourism.\nThe report was conducted by The Post Office Travel Money on 16 cities in Europe and New York, comparing the prices of the city’s major cultural attractions that tourists would visit.\nThe sites chosen for Dublin were the National Museum, National Gallery and Trinity College’s Old Library (pictured) and Book of Kells exhibit, as well as theatre events held in the city.\nThe report put the cost of attending all these sites and events in Dublin at €100 while a similar outing would cost €397 in London, €342 in Paris and €680 in New York, the most expensive of all the cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:21:14.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
