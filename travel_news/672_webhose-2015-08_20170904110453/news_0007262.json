MAKES 2 small loaves, enough for 6-8 INGREDIENTS 500g strong bread flour 2 tsp Maldon salt, plus extra for seasoning 110g dried easy-blend yeast 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling a small bunch of fresh thyme METHOD Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl. Add the salt, yeast, olive oil and 400ml cold water, and mix with a wooden spoon until well combined. As the dough comes together, knead for 10 minutes by hand (or for five minutes if you are using a free-standing mixer with a dough hook). Lift the dough from the bowl and shape it into a large ball. Lightly grease the dough with a little olive oil then gently put back into the bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and set somewhere warm to prove for an hour or so, or until it has doubled in size. Knock the dough down, and knead it for a further five minutes by hand (or for half that time if you are using a mixer). Lightly grease two small baking trays with olive oil, split the dough in two and put each portion on a tray. Gently press the dough into the corners of each tray so that it fills it all, then set to one side to prove for another hour. Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. When you are ready to bake the bread, poke holes into the top of the dough, drizzle generously with olive oil and sprinkle with salt. Scrunch up the sprigs of thyme and press them into the little holes, then place the trays in the middle of the oven to bake for 20 minutes, until the bread is golden on top â€“ it is particularly delicious when served still hot.
