Mike Jennings (President, CEO): Thanks Julia, good morning, thank you for joining us on HollyFrontier 's second-quarter earnings call. Today we reported second-quarter net income attributable to HFC shareholders of $361 million, or $1.88 per diluted share. Excluding the $135 million in non-cash lower of cost or market inventory gain, net income attribute to HFC shareholders was $278 million, or $1.45 per diluted share. Strong refining operations, improved realized margins and lower costs drove more than a 60% increase in earnings per share, year over year. Second-quarter EBITDA, excluding the inventory adjustment, was $531 million, 37% above the comparable quarter last year. Adjusted second-quarter refining segment income from operations was $441 million, more than 50% above the $292 million reported in the same quarter last year. Despite tight crude differentials in the current quarter, HollyFrontier 's EBITDA and refining operating income approached levels not seen since early 2013, when the Brent CI spread was nearly $20 per barrel. Our refineries are operating safely and reliably across all regions. Second-quarter 2015 refinery utilization rate was 101% of [gain play] capacity, and 106% of expected crude throughput, the highest quarterly rate realized since our merger. In the Mid-Con, the Tulsa and El Dorado refineries operated there over 100% utilization rate, achieving new record crude rates in the second quarter. Our feedstock optimization strategy in the region continues to drive performance improvement, eliminating previous crude rate constraints caused by gas, oil and naphtha containment. Strong operational performance in the quarter allowed us to capitalize on the constructive margin environment. On a per barrel basis, consolidated refining gross margin was $17.42, or 20% above the $14.55 of gross margin recorded in Q2 of 2014, driven by a combination of higher benchmark margins and improved margin capture. We're continuing to see strong gasoline demand, encouraged by lower prices at the pump and by an improving labor market. Summer gasoline pricing is the lowest we've seen in years, with the natural average at $2.64 per gallon in the second quarter. Monthly vehicle sales remain strong, and skewed towards SUV and light truck sales. And data through May shows vehicle miles traveled now surpassing 2007 levels by 3.4%, on year-to-date basis. 1 of 12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T22:05:31.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
