We say it because she is at the top of the list of the best.“That’s what those ads [the YouTube ads] say; they mean we have the best rates,” he added. “Best means best; better than anyone else. The common sense way that people hear this ad and will react when they hear ‘the best rate’ at the website is that they have the lowest rate and that’s just not so.”Ruden said ASTA isn’t saying Marriott cannot promote itself but it also objects that the company “overtly disparages travel agents in their effort to drive traffic to the website.” Buying only on price “It’s definitely a bit of a stab at us,” W. Josh Whitaker, CTA, said referring to the YouTube spots.“We know the product inside and out,” said Whitaker who is with Dallas, Tex.-based Rudi Steele Travel. “What type of advice can a website give you on room types or the destination?“If somebody is buying only on price, they don’t need a travel agent,” he added. “For our agency, it won’t impact us. Our clients are devoted to us.”Still, Whitaker isn’t surprised by the go-direct message. “We’ve always been bypassed by vendors,” he said. “It’s not new.’Ellen Markus, with Worldview Travel in Palm Desert, Calif., agreed.“[Marriott has] always done things like that,” she said. “They’ve always had rates that are non-commissionable, so this doesn’t surprise me. [But] this won’t impact my Ritz-Carlton business.” Ironic Other agents commented on the YouTube spots’ cringe factor.“It’s uncomfortable to watch,” said Patricia Pesti, CTC, president and CEO of Westin, Fla.-based Incredible Destinations. “It’s funny because Marriott really tries the hardest of all the [large hotel companies] to support us. Seeing this doesn’t really make sense.“We should be the first client of a supplier,” Pesti said. “Once they give the benefit of our commission to the client, I don’t support that [approach]. I have to be able to offer the same rate.”SmartFlyer’s Holtz, however, struck a philosophical note in his reaction.“If there is one thing that’s constant in life, it’s change,” he said. “If you can’t deal with change, it’s going to be rough.” 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T18:04:36.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
