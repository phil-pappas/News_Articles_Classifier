On the sandy shores of Lake Michigan sits the city of Saugatuck’s crown jewel: Oval Beach. The destination for vacationers and locals has gained international recognition for its beautiful sand, lake views and location. Adjacent to the north end of the beach is the Saugatuck Harbor Natural Area, 173 acres of land that multiple groups worked to preserve in 2011. Sitting in the middle of sand dunes and bordered by the Kalamazoo River, Oval Beach is a popular retreat. During the summer months, visitors arrive early in the morning to get a spot on the sand to enjoy the waves and sun. There are no lifeguards on duty at Oval Beach — but there is a concession stand, bathrooms, showers, swing set, picnic tables, grills and multiple parking lots. Admission to the city-owned park is $8 daily or $50 for a season for non-residents — and credit cards are accepted at the gate. Residents can buy a $20 season pass. The beach is located at the end of Perryman Drive in the city of Saugatuck.   @SentinelAmy.
