He’d scored one goal in 57 career MLS appearances entering Saturday. \nYet he bagged two before the clock even hit the 50 th minute at CenturyLink Field. \nBoth were well taken, too. The first coupled a smooth half-turn with a low, controlled finish, and the second was instinctive, a back-heel that perfectly directed Cristian Techera’s shot inside the left post. \nKah, a Portland Timber before joining the Whitecaps last offseason, heaped an additional helping of misery onto his longtime rivals. Pedro Morales slipped in the dagger with 15 minutes to go with an inch-perfect free kick from the top, left side of the Sounder box. \nSeattle has now lost seven matches out of eight, and the reinforcements that arrived Saturday didn’t do much good against Vancouver. \nNearly back at full strength, the Sounders are running out of excuses for their poor run. With a vital stretch of games lined up one after the other, they’re running out of chances to stop this season from slipping away. \n- Seattle looked like a team whose best players hadn’t played together in a month. \nForward Clint Dempsey made his first Sounders appearance since that combustible U.S. Open Cup match a month-and-a-half ago. Captain Brad Evans also played his first MLS game since June, and the last time goalkeeper Stefan Frei manned the post, he slumped off the field during Seattle’s July 3 game against D.C. with his arm in a sling. \nBut while the Sounders fielded their strongest lineup quite some time, it didn’t immediately mesh. Passing combinations never quite clicked, and flicks were dropped backwards for nobody. \nEspecially when contrasted with Vancouver’s sharpness, Seattle looked slow, sluggish. The Sounders may have seen more of the ball in the first half, but this was a Whitecap type of game: Lying in wait, pouncing on mistakes and flying forward. \nA miscommunication led to the first goal, when Kendall Waston was first left unmarked at the near post then Kah was left alone for long enough to turn and fire. \n- There is no love lost between these two teams. \nMaybe this goes without saying in a rivalry match, but Sounders-Whitecaps has always felt more of the mutual-respect type than one that boils blood. These two squads, though, are not particularly fond of one another. \nGuys went late into tackles, making sure their adversaries felt them. Dempsey went forehead-to-forehead with Gershon Koffie midway through the first half, and Gonzalo Pineda got in a heated argument with Octavio Rivera shortly afterwards. \nThis was an ill-tempered sort of game, frustrating being vented at Gold Cup villain Mark Geiger when not at each other. The referee appeared to miss a handball on Kah late in the first half, and the angry hand-waving only got more animated from there. \nThese two teams face off three more times before the calendar hits October, once more in MLS and twice in CONCACAF Champions League play, so there will be plenty of time to develop personal rivalries, to let tensions simmer. \nThe Sounders have traditionally lorded over this series, with a 64-50-22 record against the Whitecaps dating back to the NASL days. But with Saturday’s win, Vancouver took a 5-4-4 lead in the MLS era. Seattle could have clinched the Cascadia Cup for the first time since 2011 with a win, but Vancouver now gets to keep it around for at least a little bit longer.
