Business writer Hazel Davis replies: The Consumer Rights Act comes into force on 1 October this year. The idea is to make the law clearer and easier to understand, empowering consumers to buy with confidence and rectify disputes quicker. The changes will affect every business that sells directly to the UK’s consumers who, incidentally spend £90bn per month. The act satisfies new EU rules that require member states to have an independent mediator for all sectors. When the act comes into force, it will cover what happens when goods are faulty, how services should match up to what has been agreed and what should happen when they do not, or when they are not provided with reasonable care and skill. It also covers unfair terms in a contract, what happens when a business is acting in an uncompetitive way as well as greater flexibility for public enforcers such as Trading Standards to respond to consumer law breaches. Two new areas of law are of interest in the Act. It will be the first time that digital content rights have been set out in legislation, giving consumers rights on repair and replacement of faulty content such as films, games and downloads. The other key point is that there will now be clear rules for what should happen if a service is not provided with “reasonable care and skill” or as agreed. The business providing the service now has to bring it in line with what was agreed or reimburse the customer. Richard Cottrell, managing director at IT service company Vista Retail Support, adds: The advent of the new Act and consumer ombudsman will ensure customer delight rather than just customer satisfaction becomes paramount. If a product is faulty, it can be exchanged but if service is at fault, the pain will linger both for the retailer and the customer. Savvy retailers are already helping store staff deliver cutting-edge customer delight with the introduction of smart technology to keep store staff informed of both what the retailer has to offer and, more importantly, what the customer is likely to want. By gathering information about their customers via loyalty cards, social media and even biometric recognition, the retailers have a good idea of their customers’ requirements. If they can deliver that to the hands of their sales staff, they are well on the road to providing the service that the increasingly demanding consumer wants. The two new forces of good on the side of consumers are being widely reported so retailers can expect an increase in customer complaints because of the media coverage. Retailers can use the same smart technology to handle the disgruntled customer as they do to support their happy ones. Mobile technology on the shop floor can be used to exchange or return goods and if customers aren’t happy complaining face to face, in-store kiosks can give them an anonymous route to the central customer services department. Of course, all of this technology is only good if it’s working. The most frustrated customer is the one waiting in a queue because the till’s not working. Even worse from a retailer’s point of view, the customer may not complain, they may just walk away. • Whatever legal changes are made, you can protect your business with the right company car financed the best way.
