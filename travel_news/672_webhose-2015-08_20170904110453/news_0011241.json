For those who did not see my previous threads Im European national who has been offered an internship in India for 6-12 months. I want to thank again all the people that helped me a lot already on this forum, unfortunately my situation was a bit special and going with and now the company and I finally think going for an unpaid internship is the most appropriate way to make this internship opportunity come true. I understand that unpaid internships would require an Entry Visa ( Visa to Work as unpaid intern ). The offering company is offering to take care of my expenses including housing, food, transportation, and incidentals. I have questions about how this would work: Since I would have to sign a lease to rent a flat, Im assuming the company would have to give me a monthly housing stipend. Would they just deposit this amount in my bank account every month? For food, transportation and incidentals, would I need to submit receipts under the terms of the Entry Visa or could the company just give me a stipend for these items? They said they would prefer to give me a stipend.. I was told I would need a PAN card. Is this correct? Why? Finally, am I correct in assuming that the company would need to detail these stipends in their offer letter that goes with the visa application? I know it makes a lot of questions, but I could not get answers anywhere. Any tips or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you and have a nice day!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T07:47:24.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
