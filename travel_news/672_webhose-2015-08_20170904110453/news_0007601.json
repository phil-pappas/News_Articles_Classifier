Holmes, chairman and chief executive officer, Wyndham Worldwide; and Faith Taylor, senior vice president, corporate social responsibility, Wyndham Worldwide, presented a check for $100,000 to “Birdies Fore Backpacks” from the Company’s Wishes by Wyndham Foundation. “Birdies Fore Backpacks” launched in 2014 to fight childhood food insecurity in the Piedmont Triad and is perhaps the most important charitable initiative in tournament history.\n“Birdies Fore Backpacks” is the official charity of the Wyndham Championship, and supports charitable organizations which fill backpacks with nutritionally sound meals for low income kids and families to take home every weekend. During its inaugural run last year, “Birdies Fore Backpacks” raised nearly $200,000 to help feed hungry children in the Piedmont Triad region.\nHeld annually at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, N.C., the Wyndham Championship offers a week full of golf, charitable giving, as well as family-fun activities and prizes. For many fans, the tournament may be their last escape of the summer, and for the players, it’s the last PGA TOUR stop before the FedExCup Playoffs and seen as a must-play for those looking to win points to either qualify for or improve their standing entering the Playoffs. Earlier this year, the PGA TOUR and Wyndham Worldwide announced that Wyndham has extended its title sponsorship of the Tournament, one of the TOUR’s longest-running tournaments, through 2026.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T07:56:51.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
