The subsystem was delivered to GPIM prime contractor, Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., for integration into the Ball-designed Configurable Platform (BCP) 100 spacecraft bus. Scheduled to launch in 2016, the GPIM will provide safer operations and higher performance on future missions. A green propellant propulsion subsystem was recently delivered to Ball Aerospace for integration into the Green Propellant Infusion Mission spacecraft. The subsystem will be one of three experimental payloads on the spacecraft.

Following extensive testing, we ended up with a propulsion design using a new, green monopropellant, which will fly into orbit in 2016. The mission will demonstrate the use of this American-made green propellant for multiple applications â€“ a key objective.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T02:06:55.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
