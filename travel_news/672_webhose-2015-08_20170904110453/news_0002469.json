This edition of the MIMF takes as theme the concept “Soundmazing”, and will certainly move audiences and reveal the charm of singing through the most pure vocal music.\nGustav Mahler – Symphony No. 3 marks the Festival’s opening; Faust brings it to a close\nThe MIMF’s grand opening falls on the Macao Orchestra’s shoulders, which joins hands with the China NCPA Orchestra and Choir, the Macao Youth Choir and the Swedish mezzo-soprano Charlotte Hellekant to interpret the extraordinary Symphony No. 3 by Gustav Mahler. One of the most masterful and rich symphonic masterpieces requires an orchestra of over 100 musicians as well as a choir of close to 100 women and children’s voices, creating an unparalleled magnificent performance.\nThe Festival comes to a close with a co-production between the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the MIMF of Charles Gounod’s opera in five acts Faust, an insurmountable work of human nature and life’s contradictions exploration, which will transport the audience to the golden ages of French opera through a tense plot and extraordinary music, sets and wardrobe. The Festival also joins hands with Moscow’s Novaya Opera Theatre in the production of the one act opera Mozart and Salieri – Opera in 1 Act by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, deconstructing one of the mysteries in the life of the musical prodigy.\nSource:- Macao Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:23:11.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
