Soccer in Orlando is becoming a huge economic engine in the region, drawing hundreds of thousands of fans to Central Florida. International matches alone contribute millions of dollars in economic impact to the region and put it on the map as a major destination for the global sport. That’s why the Orlando City Lions’ owners are looking into potentially expanding their foothold in Orlando sports. They have told the nine-team National Women’s Soccer League and the 24-team USL Pro that they want to launch Orlando-based teams in each of those leagues. The Lions formerly played in the USL Pro before their jump to the MLS last November. Orlando’s potential future USL Pro team is set to begin play next season pending approval from the USL Pro league and MLS, according to the Lions’ website. Rumor has it the NWSL also is looking to field its 10th team by next season. USL Pro has confirmed it received an application from Orlando City for a new team and is in the process of reviewing it. In addition, on the Lions’ website, the USL Pro president said his league is excited about the prospect of having a team in Orlando again. The NWSL couldn’t be reached for comment. Details on the potential teams remain unknown, but Orlando City likely would allow the teams to play at its future $155 million stadium and would use them to cross-promote each other. For example, the MLS’ Houston Dynamo and its sister team, the NWSL’s Houston Dash, provide special deals to season ticket holders to boost both teams’ attendance and bottom line. The same is the case for MLS and USL Pro teams. “We have made a massive impact on the first core of soccer fans and sports fans in the region,” said Phil Rawlins , founder and president of Orlando City Soccer Club. “Our next opportunity is to move on beyond that core to the second tier of sports fans, and [games like the U.S. vs. Brazil women’s match] is a great way to do that.” The market is rife with potential for more professional soccer teams. “There was a latent marketplace for soccer and we knew we had to activate that,” said Rawlins. “Having a Major League Soccer team in town as a catalyst for these things allows us to grow the game on all levels.” Indeed, the growing local soccer fan base has been helping to raise the reputation of Orlando as a host city for many sporting events. Many of Orlando City’s games are televised in Brazil, which helps further promote visitation to Central Florida. And adding two more pro soccer teams here has the potential to grow that engagement with Orlando’s No. 1 international market. Here’s a quick look of Orlando’s soccer portfolio: Orlando is home to a Major League Soccer franchise, the Orlando City Soccer Club . The team estimates it will have a $1 billion impact on the region during the next 30 years. The city hosts multiple international matches at the Orlando Citrus Bowl, including the Mexico and Costa Rica match in June that attracted more than 50,000 fans. Another match between two Mexican-based teams — Cruz Azul Futbol Club and Puebla Futbol Club — is set for September. Those games each can generate more than $10 million in economic impact if only a fraction are out-of-town travelers. The region is catering to the growing popularity of women’s soccer by hosting a friendly match between the U.S. Women’s Soccer team and Brazil. This game will draw 40,000 fans who can have a multimillion-dollar economic impact from both U.S. and Brazil fans traveling to see the match. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said the growth of Orlando’s soccer identity is just beginning. “We are becoming a hub for all soccer fans. We had Premiere League teams play, we have two Mexican teams playing in September and more, so we certainly are becoming a destination for markets like Mexico and Brazil tourism.” Biz pulse Do you think Orlando should get a professional women’s soccer team? 65%: You bet.

General contractor Barton Malow is reviewing the design documents based on the revised plans. The firm hopes to release all remaining packages to the subcontractor market in October with bids due in November, but that timetable is subject to change, said Lenny Santiago, team spokesman. The new stadium will seat 25,000 fans and include overhanging roofs on each side. It also will include office space and training spaces.
