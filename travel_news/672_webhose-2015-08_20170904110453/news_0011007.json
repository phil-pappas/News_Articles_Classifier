So much great food comes into my kitchen from within the county.” Nature has given the island of Ireland a head start, of course. The ocean that shaped the Wild Atlantic Way – the magical coastline road stretching 1,500 miles along the island’s western seaboard – nourishes the organic salmon of Bantry Bay and the famed Galway oyster. Acres of rich, emerald pasture fatten free-range Dexter beef and sweet Connemara Hill lamb. In between are wind-whipped beaches where locals forage for tasty, vitamin-packed seaweeds and turn them into traditional dulse and exotic contemporary dishes. Local producers will not only sell you a wedge of cheese or a soda bread bap but entertain you with its life history (and, probably, their own) But it’s the Irish people who make Irish cuisine the delight it is. You’ll meet them at the numerous farmers’ markets, such as Cork’s elegant English Market, which dates back to 1788, or St George’s Market in Belfast, where local producers will not only sell you a wedge of cheese or a soda bread bap but entertain you with its life history (and, probably, their own). You can pick up local arts and crafts here as well – they make great souvenirs to take home. Soak up the pretty surroundings of Grattan Square at Dungarvan Farmers’ Market in County Waterford. And at Naas Farmers’ Market in County Kildare, one of the most famous markets in Ireland, you can buy organic produce from the Wicklow hills, and hand-made farmhouse cheeses with evocative names such as St Tola and Knockalara from Sheridan’s Cheesemongers. The Irish love to smoke almost anything, from eels to venison, but smoked salmon is one of their gastronomic highlights, and they don’t come any higher than Frank Hederman’s Belvelly Smoke House in Cobh, County Cork. Visit Connemara Smokehouse in the tiny village of Ballyconneely, Galway, and you can enjoy a smokehouse tour before dining on its finest smoked salmon, tuna and mackerel. Fresh produce: the English Market in Cork dates back to 1788 Don’t forget to sample the many traditional recipes based around the humble potato, from champ (with onions and butter) and fadge (melting potato cakes) to boxty (pancakes), colcannon (with cabbage or kale) and more. There’s innovation, too. Dublin and Belfast may not produce so much food but they certainly know how to cook it. Dublin boasts four of the island’s nine Michelin-starred restaurants, including Thornton’s Restaurant overlooking elegant St Stephen’s Green, and Ireland’s only two-starred establishment, Patrick Guilbaud at the Merrion Hotel. The Mourne Seafood Bar in Belfast does a roaring trade in locally-caught oysters and Mourne mussels, while the city’s Crown Bar mixes Victorian chic with classic pub food such as black pudding potato cake and sausage and champ. Stylish eatery OX bases its menu around food that is in season. Dishes range from Mourne Mountain lamb, black olive, basil gnocchi and samphire to halibut, clam, sea lettuce, fennel and bisque. Add to that its beautiful setting overlooking the River Lagan, and it’s easy to see how and why its popularity has soared and the awards have come rolling in. For a truly singular experience, you can enjoy a re-creation of the last first-class dinner on the Titanic at Rayanne House in Belfast The two cities are also perfect spots for a cup of tea and a slice of cake. Step back in time at Titanic Belfast with a Sunday afternoon tea alongside a replica grand staircase from the stricken ship. In Dublin, sip on world-famous teas at elegant Clement & Pekoe on South William Street, indulge your sweet tooth at the Queen of Tarts café and patisserie or recline in the grand surroundings of The Gresham Hotel. According to John and Sally McKennas’ 100 Best Restaurants in Ireland guide, the island’s finest dining city is Galway on the Wild Atlantic Way. There, the choice includes the contemporary radicalism of Loam, and Kai Café + Restaurant, where chef Jessica Murphy’s ultra-creative dishes look as good as they taste. On the last weekend in September Galway hosts the celebrated International Oyster and Seafood Festival, one of dozens of foodie fests in the island’s calendar. Others coming up in September include the toe-tapping Waterford Harvest Festival (more a family jamboree than a celebration of corn dollies); the 10-day A Taste of West Cork Food Festival, with events ranging from cookery workshops to whale watching; and the Bushmills Salmon and Whiskey Festival near the magnificent Giant’s Causeway. Finally, for a truly singular experience, you can enjoy a re-creation of the last first-class dinner on the Titanic (all nine courses of it) at Rayanne House in Belfast, or get a group of eight fans together to wolf down a full mediaeval banquet with a Game of Thrones theme at Winterfell on Strangford Lough. When it comes to cuisine, Ireland, it seems, is still an island of dreams. • Come and find your holiday inspiration at ireland.com 'Live in the now' in Ireland Savour every second in Ireland, where the natural beauty, the culture and the people all seem to exist together in a timeless moment.
