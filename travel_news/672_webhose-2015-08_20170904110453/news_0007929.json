The dump was in use roughly between 1568 and 1634.\nThe three male and nine female bodies “were discarded into the dump like household garbage,” with no funeral structures nor grave goods, and the skeletons were lying skewed on the ground, the researchers said in the September edition of the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, provided to The Associated Press on Wednesday.\nThe Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536. Its most common accusation was maintaining outlawed Jewish practices in secret. Hundreds of Jews were burned at the stake, and living conditions in Inquisition jails often caused prisoners’ deaths. A proper burial was denied to Jews.\nMost Read Stories Chelan blazes: With no end in sight, thousands evacuate Reactions mixed to NYT story about Amazon’s work conditions South Snohomish softball team loses Little League World Series tiebreaker game, 3-2 Motel 6 in Bremerton explodes into flames South Snohomish softball team accused of throwing World Series game The researchers said it was impossible to know for certain if the skeletons were Jews.\nThe excavations were carried out in 2007 and 2008 during the renovation of the former Inquisition court building. Only 12 percent of the yard was excavated, researchers from the Portuguese universities of Evora and Coimbra said.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:44:08.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
