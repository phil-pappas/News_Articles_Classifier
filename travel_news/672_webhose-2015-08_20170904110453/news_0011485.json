In 2015, Australia's vehicle motorization rate stood at 764 vehicles per 1,000 people. As a result of this high motorization rate coupled with the country's robust road infrastructure and rising standards of living, the Australasian tyre market continues to witness modest growth. An increase in automobile sales and shortening replacement period of tyres is boosting the demand for tyres in Australia . With only three passenger car manufacturers, Holden, Toyota and Ford, currently operating in Australia , the country's tyre market is dominated by replacement market. Moreover, all OEMs (excluding MHCVs) plan to close their production units by 2017, which would further increase dependence of the tyre market on replacement sales in the coming years.\nThe Australian tyre market is estimated to reach around US$ 2.8 billion in 2020. Major factors driving growth in the market includes increasing replacement demand due to modest growth in automobile sales during last five years, and increasing tyre sales through online portals such as Bob Jane , Tyreright, St George Tyres, etc. Few of the major tyre companies operating in Australia include Bridgestone, Goodyear, Dunlop and Yokohoma. Though these leading global tyre companies are expected to continue their domination in Australia , they are anticipated to witness a decline in their respective shares on account of increasing consumer inclination towards low cost Chinese tyre products.\nWhy You Should Buy This Report?\n- To gain an in-depth understanding of tyre market in Australia\n- To identify the on-going trends and segment wise anticipated growth in the coming years\n- To help industry consultants, tyre companies and other stakeholders to align their market-centric strategies\n- To gain in-depth understanding of market dynamics, imports, trends and opportunities in Australia .\n- To obtain research based business decision and add weight to presentations and marketing materials.\n- To gain competitive knowledge of leading players\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
