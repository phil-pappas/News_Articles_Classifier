As a result, many homeless families are finding it increasingly difficult to find a bed, the homelessness agency said. \nThe Department of the Environment yesterday published new figures which show there had been a 55% rise in the number of families presenting homeless in the country since the start of the year. \nSister Stanislaus Kennedy from Focus Ireland said a lack of social housing was to blame. \n\"They come to us and we have very few alternatives for them, because there is very little social housing, and furthermore they can't afford to pay the rent,\" she said. \n\"They only place we can place them is in a B&B or in a hotel, and that has become increasingly difficult over the summer because of the tourist season,\" she said. \n\"I have been working in this area for 30 years (and) I have never seen anything so bad. It's deeply serious.\" \nAccording to the Department of Environment, the number of homeless adults urgently needing a bed is at a high of 3,258. \nIts report also shows that in the first six months of this year the number of families seeking immediate help increased from 401 to 620, while there were over 1,300 children in emergency accommodation, a 52% rise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:25.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
