The incident took place on Monday at the Ben Gurion International Airport.\nIsraeli travelers en route to Poland found them stranded for as long as two hours. Dozens of passengers were teens and were on their way to Poland. The plane belonged to a Polish carrier Enter Air and reports suggest that the pilot failed to put on the air conditioner of the aircraft due to some unscrupulous malfunctioning.\nAfter a substantial chaos on board, the pilot was forced to open the door. Some of the young passengers stood on the stairs to breathe, reports the Times of Israel. Then everyone just left the plane and stood on the tarmac nearby.\nAccording to the representatives of Enter Air, the flightâ€™s departure time had been moved up, but the plane had landed at the airport too late and missed its spot.\nThe departure was further delayed by the malfunction. The company acknowledged that the plane had been grounded without air conditioning, but said the ground staff at the airport did not instruct the crew to evacuate it even when it became clear that there was a technical malfunction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:51:21.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
