During Friday, Erika will travel through the British and United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\nErika remains a tropical storm spinning about 85 miles west of Guadeloupe, as of 8 a.m. EDT Thursday.\nWinds will blow at an average speed between 40 and 60 mph (64 to 95 kph), with higher gusts posing the threat of uprooting tress, damaging roofs. A general rainfall of 2-4 inches (50-100 mm) is forecast with locally higher amounts.\nBathers and boaters need to be cautious and avoiding going out to the seas.\nFlash flooding and mudslides pose the greatest threat. Flash flooding has occurred on some of the Leeward Islands, on the island of Dominica.\nAccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowsk explains that ‘Erika will have to survive strong wind shear and the frictional effects of the mountainous islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.’\nErika’s timing of turn to the northwest and then to the north will determine the extent of impacts in the Bahamas and Florida. If the system survives as far north as Florida, there will be concerns farther north into the Southern states, especially in the Carolinas and perhaps as far west as Louisiana.\nThere is also the chance the system stalls along the Southeast U.S. coast after negotiating Florida waters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:51:42.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
