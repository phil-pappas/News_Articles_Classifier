I just thought: ‘If he doesn’t get looked after, he’s not going to last.’” \nAlongside raising £3,000 for charities including Reuben’s Retreat, the Greek Cats Welfare Society, the Soi Dog Foundation and Hull Greyhound Rescue, Murray also appealed to people to give their loose change to help her rescue Tiger. \n“I put a picture of Tiger and his little story on an envelope, and I said if you’ve got any change, just stick it inside,” she said. \nMurray is now aiming to head to Crete in September to bring Tiger back to the UK, where he will join her three other cats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:53:05.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
