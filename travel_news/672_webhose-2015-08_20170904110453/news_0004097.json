And at the Wild Center in Tupper Lake, they're taking education out onto the river in a summer canoe series.\nOur canoe trek starts with a walk through the woods to the shore of the Raquette River.\nNaturalist Paige Engelbrektsson distributes seats, paddles and life jackets, and an interesting fact about the river here.\n\"The Oxbow is a very special place on the river,\" she explained. \"It's different than the rest of the Raquette River, which is right now flowing north to south. That's actually counter to the way it normally runs. Because the Adirondacks are on a plateau, the river typically runs south to north, which is strange for a river.\"\nBecause of the oxbow shape, the river also runs slower here and is shallower. And the animals love it.\n\"I have promised dinner to the first person to see a real life moose on one of our canoe trips,\" Engelbrektsson said.\nShe hasn't had to make good on that promise yet, but she'd like to. And soon into the trip, we find out why she hopes we spot one!\n\"If you follow pickerelweed down to the ground, to its base, it has a very white, fleshy, tuber-like root that is a favorite of a large animal here in the Adirondacks,\" Engelbrektsson said. \"Any guesses?\"\nMoose! But while the moose weren't around, the fragrant white lilies were.\n\"Those are beautiful. They have those classic lily flowers with lots of petals. And their leaves have a cleft, but they're mostly round,\" Engelbrektsson said.\nAs we paddle along, she points out the yellow lilies are droopy. Normally, they have corkscrew stems to accommodate changing water levels. This year, they're totally straight.\n\"The water has been so high for so long though, they've just grown out,\" she explained.\nThat high water level didn't make it hard for us though. It was smooth sailing-- or rather paddling-- as we navigated the river. But at our final spot, our canoes brushed up against the bottom. Here, beavers have slapped together sticks and mud to make a dam to slow the river and a lodge to live in.\n\"They go up into the lodge and they actually have different rooms inside of the lodge for different purposes,\" Engelbrektsson said.\nShe says getting people out to where they can see, touch and smell nature is key to learning.\n\"That's not something you can replicate by just showing them a picture or a dried specimen,\" she explained. \"You can say you have a visible, tangible connection to what we're talking about, and you will remember this better than you would if we were talking about it in any other way.\"\n\"The one thing I didn't know was about the lily pads,\" participant Bill Gordon said. \"The ones that had the slime on the bottom and why. I never knew that, and I've seen them all over the place.\"\nFor Gordon and wife and grandsons, the bottoms of the yellow lily leaves were a family favorite! And it's an experience they say they'd do again.\nIf you want to go, they'll be doing these canoe trips every afternoon from 2 to 4 p.m. until the end of the month. You can fit up to three adults, or two adults and up to two children, in each canoe. It costs $30 per canoe for nonmembers and $25 for members.
