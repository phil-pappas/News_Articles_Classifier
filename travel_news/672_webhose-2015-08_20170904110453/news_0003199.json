(Colorado Judicial Department via AP) Robert and Arlene Homes held hands, their fingers interlaced, and directed their eyes at the floor. With each unanimous \"yes,\" it became ever more clear that jurors believe their son's crimes outweighed their testimony. She began to cry, and her husband held out a box of tissues.\nMore tears flowed in the gallery. Rena Medek began silently sobbing when the judge read the name of her 23-year-old daughter Micayla. Ian Sullivan, the father of Holmes' youngest victim, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, closed his eyes when her name was read. Veronica's grandfather, Robert Sullivan, glared at Holmes and nodded his head softly.\n\"We are one step closer,\" Joshua Nowlan said outside court, adding that he's \"very happy with the results.\"\nJosh Nowlan, who was wounded in the 2012 movie theater shooting at Aurora, Colo., heads to court to hear the reading in penalty phase 2 in the trial of shooter James Holmes Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.

Then, the nine women and three men will finally decide whether the 27-year-old Holmes should receive a lethal injection, or spend life in prison without parole.\nSandy Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was killed, said prosecutors advised her that she would be testifying on Tuesday.\nTom Sullivan, front, who lost his son in the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., heads to court to hear the reading in penalty phase 2 in the trial of James Holmes Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.

Their quick decision on Monday raised expectations that they will choose a death sentence after what prosecutors estimate will be two or three more days of testimony from survivors.\nBut legal experts said there's no way to predict that final decision.\nRena Medek, left, walks out with an unidentified woman after the reading in penalty phase 2 in the trial of James Holmes Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.

They found simply that Holmes' mental problems and the portrait his attorneys painted of a kinder, gentler younger man did not outweigh the horrors of his calculated attack on defenseless moviegoers.\nThis next stage can be more challenging for each juror, and to choose capital punishment, they must be unanimous, Denver defense attorney Dan Recht said.\n\"They're making the ultimate decision of life or death, quite literally,\" Recht said. \"All they need is one holdout ... We are far from over on this.\"\nLonnie Phillips, left, and his wife, Sandy, who lost her daughter 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo, arrives to court to hear the reading in penalty phase 2 in the trial of James Holmes Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.

They said it was schizophrenia, not free will, that drove him to murder. They called his former teachers, friends, sister and parents, who said \"Jimmy\" had been a friendly child who withdrew socially as he grew older.\nRobert and Arlene Holmes testified that they never suspected their son was mentally ill. But Robert Holmes acknowledged that they rarely communicated in the months before the theater attack, and that in his family, emotions just weren't talked about, even though his own father and sister had been hospitalized with mental illness.\n\"He was not a violent person. At least not until the event,\" Robert Holmes said, referring to the theater attack.\nIan Sullivan-Moser, right, who lost his 6-year-old daughter in the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., exits from the Arapahoe County Courthouse with an unidentified woman after the reading in penalty phase 2 in the trial of James Holmes Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, in Centennial, Colo.

He broke up with his first and only girlfriend and dropped out of school, abandoning his longtime goal of becoming a scientist. He obtained prescription anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medicine by seeing a campus psychiatrist, but hid the depth of his turmoil from everyone, describing it instead in a secret journal.\nThat eerie notebook — which Holmes mailed to the psychiatrist hours before opening fire in the theater — became key evidence. In it, Holmes diagnosed himself with a litany of mental problems and methodically laid out his plans to kill. He wrote that he tried to fix his own brain, and failed.\nShortly after midnight, he slipped into the premiere of a Batman movie, stood before the capacity crowd of more than 400 people, threw gas canisters, and then opened fire, with a shotgun, assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol before surrendering meekly to police outside.\nLonnie and Sandy Phillips, whose daughter Jessica Ghawi was killed in the 2012 Aurora movie theatre attack, speak with members of the media on the day of the reading of the verdict in penalty phase 2 of the James Holmes trial at the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo., Monday, Aug. 3, 2015. Jurors declined to rule out the death penalty Monday as they now move toward sentencing Holmes. The decision clears the way for one last attempt from both sides to sway the jury with gripping testimony from victims about their harm and suffering as well as the defense's appeals to show mercy.
