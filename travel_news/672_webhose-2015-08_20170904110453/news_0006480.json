The previously 'Top Secret' files show how a “mole” in Britain’s nuclear weapons research programme was given instructions by his Soviet handlers which read like details from a John le Carré novel. • MI5 spied on novelist Doris Lessing for decades, files disclose The papers focus on Dr Klaus Fuchs , a nuclear scientist who did immeasurable damage to Anglo-American interests by giving away secrets from the Manhattan Project and Britain’s atomic research, code-named Tube Alloys. In 1950 Fuchs was jailed for 14 years for breaching the Official Secrets Act by handing the Russians designs, mathematical equations and techniques used in the first atom bombs. I showed him a map of the Kew gardens district, and he indicated thereon three places which it is thought will be of intelligence interest. MI5 memo by Jim Skardon, 1950 In prison interviews with MI5 officers, Fuchs told how his Soviet spymasters had instructed him to throw a copy of a men’s magazine over a garden fence in Kew, south-west London, if he wanted to contact them. Fuchs also revealed how he was told to carry a tennis ball when meeting his handler, who would wear a pair of gloves and carry another pair as a “recognition signal”. On another occasion he was instructed to meet his Soviet contacts at a certain table in the Nags Head pub in Wood Green, north London. The files, released for the first time by the National Archives, disclosed how Fuchs revealed details of the Soviets’ techniques during a series of interrogations by MI5 and FBI agents in Wormwood Scrubs prison. Jim Skardon, a senior MI5 Quote: : “I showed him a map of the Kew gardens district, and he indicated thereon three places which it is thought will be of intelligence interest. “He indicated at the corner of Stanmore Road and Kew Road stands a house in its own grounds which has a garden in Stanmore Road. “He said that it was over the fence of this garden, between the second and third of four trees which stood parallel with the roadway that he was to throw a copy of ‘Men Only’, bearing upon the tenth page the suggested arrangement for a rendezvous in the event of meetings breaking down. “He indicated that having thrown a periodical into the garden … he was instructed to place a mark on the fence on the north side of Holmesdale Road opposite a tree at the eastern end of the road. “This would indicate to the occupier of the house in Stanmore Road that there was something for him in the garden. “He said that outside Kew Gardens railway station there was a parade of shops, and between two of them, very close to the bus stop, there was an entry, and it was at this point that he was instructed to place a chalk mark in the event of a rendezvous becoming dangerous for any reason.” MI5 file showing details of Soviet spy techniques disclosed by Dr Klaus Fuchs Photo: NATIONAL ARCHIVES, CROWN COPYRIGHT Skardon investigated the location and researched the names of the occupants of the house in Kew Road, but the files did not disclose the result of his inquiries. In another memo, also marked Top Secret and dated the following month, Quote: : “He gave me some details of the recognition signals for his various new contacts. “He … told me that the arrangements for the rendezvous upon returning to England in 1946 … were that his contact would carry a bundle of books tied with a cord and that he should himself carry a copy of ‘Life’.” Fuchs also named his “introducers” as Jurgen Kuczynski, a professor at Berlin University, and Hannah Klopstech, who lived in Hampstead, north London. “The arrangement made by Hannah Klopstech was that he should go to the public house at Wood Green (the Nags Head) carrying a copy of ‘Tribune’, and that he should sit at a bench with a table in front of it in the saloon bar. “His contact would carry a red book in his hands.” A mushroom cloud reaches high into the sky during atomic testing in Nevada, USA, circa 1940 Photo: Hulton Archive Apart from revealing fascinating details of Soviet spy “tradecraft”, the Fuchs files showed how the discovery of such a well-placed mole in the atomic weapons programme led to friction between Britain and the US as the hunt for his accomplices continued. A memo from a British liaison officer at Washington Embassy said: “I only pray and hope that none of these spies has either British nationality or British connections of any kind! “If they turn out to be US nationals the FBI will no doubt receive a lot of criticism for not uncovering them sooner.” • Infamous spies in history Fuchs, who fled the Nazis in 1933 to live in Britain, was released from jail and was stripped of his British citizenship in 1959. He emigrated to the German Democratic Republic and died in 1988. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T03:10:16.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
