The new jet bridge is located in the lower level of the terminal at Gate 4. This is the first jet bridge to ever be used at FWA’s lower level gates.\nThe jet bridge was installed as FWA’s passenger traffic continues to grow in 2015, with traffic up 15% through July. The new jet bridge is used heavily by Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), with an average use of 6-10 times per day.\n“The community has been very supportive of the airport and its new air service. In return, we want to ensure we’re providing a facility that allows for efficient operations and on-time arrivals and departures,” said Executive Director of Airports Scott Hinderman. “This new jet bridge will allow more than enough space to do just that.”\nFWA’s airlines will further utilize the jet bridge as refurbishment of the existing jet bridges on the upper level (gates 5-8) begins in October. Passenger boarding will be relocated to the lower level gates while the refurbishment of the existing gates is underway.\nSource:- FWI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:16:56.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
