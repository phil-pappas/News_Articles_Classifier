Today, visitors are called to this picturesque spot by The Break, Narragansett’s first boutique hotel, which combines a modern, retro-chic design with a true local South County feel. \nSince its grand opening on June 19, The Break has welcomed guests to its 16 coastal cool accommodations and Chair 5, the hotel's signature restaurant helmed by Chef Basil Yu. Additionally, guests can take advantage of amenities including a heated outdoor pool (open year-round), a rooftop lounge with panoramic views, and access to Narragansett’s best beaches and Point Judith Lighthouse. \nFor those who like to incorporate fitness into their travels, The Break is now offering poolside surfset classes twice a week. Surfset takes its cues from the ocean, using an unstable on-land apparatus that mimics the unpredictable movement of waves. During the hour-long class, experienced instructors guide participants through a series of positions that work the core, create lean muscle, and improve endurance. \nSurfset classes at The Break are held Mondays and Fridays at 10 a.m. and are open to both hotel guests and the public.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:55:23.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
