But there has been political trouble since 2009 so the tourists are fewer and fewer,\" Andrianantoanina said, as ring-tailed lemurs scampered through nearby eucalyptus trees. \nWith the mining industry hit by low global commodity prices, the government has promoted tourism as a spur of growth and job creation in one of the world's poorest nations. \nTouting its rainforests, reefs and weird and wonderful plants and animals, officials are aiming for 1 million tourists by 2020, five times higher than last year and more than double the 2008 peak, when 380,000 people visited the former French colony. \nThere are even lofty plans to compete for well-heeled visitors who flock to Mauritius and Seychelles, two \"honeymoon\" destinations where European elites have vacationed for decades. \nBut first the leaders of the world's fourth largest island have fix tourism's two biggest problems - a poorly run state airline and a toxic political system that breeds instability. \nEfforts have not gone well on either front. \nPresident Hery Rajaonarimampianina, whose peaceful election in late 2013 was seen as a new start for politics, was impeached in May. Even though he overturned the vote in the constitutional court, his government nearly fell in a subsequent censure vote. \nFixing the airline has also proved tough, with a month-long strike by Air Madagascar staff bringing the industry to its knees and adding to long-standing grievances against a loss-making and habitually late airline. \n\"It's easy to sell Madagascar abroad as a tourist destination but our main obstacle is air transportation,\" Tourism Minister Ulrich Andriantiana said. \nA Coquerel's Sifaka lemur leaps between trees inside the Lemurs Park.

You can go to Cuba, Sri Lanka, Puerto Rico and they are all cheap,\" said hotelier Hely Rakotomanantsoa. \n\"The flight costs are a really big issue.\" \nAndriantiana, the tourism minister, said the strikes had prompted the government to \"liberalise\" the skies by introducing more competition, including on domestic flights. \n\"It's not good to have a monopoly,\" he said. \"If Air Madagascar doesn't work well, every sector will fall down.\" \nThe government had held talks with Kenya Airways and Air France to introduce new international routes to open up markets in Africa, Asia and North America, he added. \nA Ring Tail lemur sits on a leaf at the Lemurs Park, a private eco-tourism enterprise which hosts nine species, near Antananarivo, Madagascar.

I would definitely come back.\" - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T02:20:02.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
