Health care - based on 7 travel reports - by Torri 0 vote(s) travel resume The travel report was written by Torri Myler who is a part of the team at a bank opening times directory - bankopening.co.uk. Truth be told, I was terrified of my first trip on my own. I have booked a flight to an exciting exotic location entirely on a whim. I didn't consider the difficulties I will have to face. But I also haven't thought how significantly this experience will enrich my life in the long run. First adventure My first solo trip has been to Zanzibar. I have chosen this dreamy, almost paradise-like part of Tanzania, because it seemed like a perfect place to cut off from overwhelming nine-to-five routine. I simply dreamt of relaxing vacations. After taking off at Abeid Amani Karume airport , I have realized that lying on a beach and sipping pineapple cocktails all day long is not the entertainment I was looking for. It has soon turned out that this journey will mean much more to me, than it was previously intended. Follow your heart And there I was – in a foreign country, not knowing the language or culture. At first I was a bit distracted. It was hard to focus on one thing and make the right call. But few days have passed and I was able to find my ways. Even when I got lost, or got myself in trouble, I took it as a challenge, not an obstacle. I have also learnt how to trust my gut instincts and distinguish right from wrong in contacts with other people. Today, I know for sure my judgement is correct. If my heart says something, I follow its commands to the letter. Pay attention to the little things Being entirely on my own , I have started to notice even the smallest acts of kindness from the locals. Their actions took many different forms. Sometimes someone has helped me find the way, or translate a road sign, other times someone has offered a glass of water and a star fruit. I felt extremely grateful for all those little things and, what's more, I have learned to notice them every day, even 7,000 miles away from Zanzibar. W eaknesses and small victories Travelling alone gives you an insightful knowledge about your personal limitations. Before my solo trip I was highly afraid of failure and criticism got me down to a great extent. Although my limitations are still present, I finally found out how to overcome them. Being alone helps us find long lost confidence. We need to remember that our voice really matters, so we shouldn’t be afraid to communicate our thoughts. The issue of materialism To my great surprise , I have discovered how little material possessions matter to me. Not even once have I glanced at my iPhone or opened my computer. I have finally realized that life is not about getting more affluent, or having the fanciest apartment on the Upper West Side, but it is about finding the special someone I would like to share my life with. Luckily, I knew exactly whom to call as soon as I get back. Exactly 4 years ago I have made it my goal to travel alone at least once a year. I have already visited Thailand, Cuba, Iceland and Sweden. I strongly believe that several alone days can teach us amazing things about ourselves, our lives and our relationships. My carefully collected experiences, troubles and joys now come together in a form of great memories. I wish you all the same.
