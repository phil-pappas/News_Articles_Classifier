Feeling claustrophobic yet? Photo: Nicole Troy Source: Supplied \nWARNING: Graphic content. Honestly, this story is disgusting. \nIT STARTED as all good horror travel stories do: An exotic location, a group of respectable travellers and a rushed decision in the heat of a polished sales pitch. \nWhat should have been the highlight of our two weeks in Vietnam, a trip to Halong Bay, was probably the low point of my life to date, far surpassing the time I ate some melting ice pre departure in Borneo and spent 14 hours teaching a plane full of people the meaning of the word misery. \nIn our defence, it seemed like a good idea. I mean, how could paradise really be wrong? A three day relaxing stay on Castaway Island enjoying a few cold beers was too tempting to resist. The pictures the sales rep showed us of white sand beaches, smiling tanned people, stunning cliffs surrounding a secluded bay and rustic looking wooden beac villas were all that was needed to convince us; despite TripAdvisor’s very mixed reviews. \nTwo bus journeys and two boats later we cornered a spectacular rock formation and finally caught our first glance of Castaway Island. It looked spectacular. All of the days’ weary travelling seemed to instantly give way to relief, excitement, the anticipation of good food and happiness; feelings I would not have again until my departure. The polluted waters of the bay, where you can’t swim without having a shower afterwards. Photo: James Cross Source: Supplied \nAs we stared into the distance taking it all in a naked Dutchman ran from the bar area with a blue elephant sock on his Mr. \n“Welccommee to Casttaawaayys,” we could faintly hear over the sound of the boat’s struggling engine and the heavily polluted waters lapping at the bow. It was at this point that I knew the five star people on Tripadvisor had betrayed me. I turned to my girlfriend, who has a gift when it comes to looking unimpressed and could only muster the strength for one word: “F***.” \nDisembarking our lifeline to the outside world, I noticed that a gaggle of boys had assembled behind the Dutchman and were eagerly eyeballing the fresh arrivals. We then marched up to the bar area, which would have been quite pleasant if not for the stench of stale alcohol and vomit. Finding relative comfort in the best-ventilated spot we could locate, it quickly became clear that our group would be separated and that we would be sleeping in shared dorms. Fantastic. \nA greasy lunch was quickly served and despite our experience so far we all tried to remain optimistic. \nMy girlfriend returned from the toilet, pale faced with a slight green tinge. “There is girl blood everywhere in the toilet,” she said trembling. “Seriously, everywhere, on the walls, on the seat. Don’t go in there. I’ve never seen anything like it.” \nMorale was fading fast. We headed off to our rooms to drop off our bags, get changed and to go for a swim. \nIt wasn’t long before we heard bass echoing around the great cliff faces rising above us. It got louder and as it did we heard chanting and screaming too. Soon a boat arrived in the bay filled to the brim with rowdy drunk people, a number with privates on display (female and male). \nAnother moment of realisation dawned on us. This was today’s version of our lovely cruise and kayaking tour around the bay booked for tomorrow. Not five minutes had passed before we realised one of the girls had swum over to the Irish lads and was “making love” to him in front of us. She seemed disgruntled when another of the Irish screamed out, “Oi, look, they’re f***ing,” which I found to be an interesting reaction considering she was hardly being discreet doing that 20 metres from us at 4.30pm on a sunny afternoon. The beautiful beach, where patrons seem to be happy to have sex in public.

Our evening kicked off with rep initiations, which involved two new team members drinking one of everything the bar had to offer in a race. \nAll guests were corralled into the bar/eating area to watch as these two people vomited in bins and were forced to then down their vomit … after a good amount of genital dunking from another rep who looked as though he had the plague, due to the infected bites all over his back. To make things worse, the spilt vomit was simply dabbed up with a grimy towel from the tables we were eating dinner from not an hour before. Hygiene was non-existent on the island and inevitably a number of our group got sick before the trip was over. \nAfter the show we decided to buy some beers and to evacuate the bar area. Sitting outside our huts, still shell shocked by the events so far, we were unsurprisingly speechless when two Dutch guys approached and suggestively announced that they had just taken viagra but had no girlfriends to enjoy it with. \nFeeling a little lost for words and thoroughly sexually harassed, we soon returned to the bar to find the plague victim getting very intimate with the girl behind the bar. \nIt dawned on us that on Castaway that there was no relief but to not be conscious, ie. bedtime. \nThe music lasted until 4am but that wasn’t an issue as I wasn’t asleep. I’ve stayed in military facilities with better accommodation. There was no airconditioning, the moving air from the ceiling fan did not reach the bottom bunks and my bed was so hard and sandy that I may as well have been sleeping on heated concrete. \nDay two began early, one of the Irish lads had loudly entered our room to try his luck with a girl in our dorm. I put that to an end quickly. \nAt breakfast, we realised that all the meals were the same. Luckily, I love grease and watermelon! As we sat eating we discovered that sadly the plague victim was not going to be joining us for our day tour. \nThe boat was an old clunker but at least it did not break down, unlike the speed boat, which was supposed to be used for the advertised tubing and wake boarding that never happened. Following the nightmare of the past 24 hours we all agreed that drinking was the only thing that would keep us sane so we began the morning with a few beers. As a result, the kayaking was actually great! We had literally just seen a penis. Photo: James Cross Source: Supplied \nHowever, upon return and having sobered up a fair amount we passed the lads on tour who had paddled a herculean distance of 50 meters to a nearby beach to continue drinking heavily. Inevitably, the obnoxious one came dancing over, manhood in hand,one too many times. He came close to a severe beating from my girlfriend. The following lecture I then had to give the rowdy lads on the definition of sexual assault and the life consequences of such a conviction seemed to knock some sense into them. \nFrom this point forward the Irish lads were pretty well behaved. The sea life, however, was not and one of my group was stung by a jellyfish. Unsure whether the skit from the show Friends was true or not, but in light of some serious swelling and pain we decided that wee was the answer. One of the other girls urinated in a cup for her as she couldn’t go and she then spent 30 minutes or so dabbing herself with pee. \nReturning to the Island that afternoon and watching the lads wave their junk about in windmill fashion reminded me of my group the day before and how, right now, there were people sitting on the beach thinking to themselves: What have I done to deserve this? This thought was strangely comforting at the time, knowing that the ordeal was almost over and that it couldn’t get worse. However, it did. The group relaxing in front of their luxury* hut. Note the rocky wall behind the hut. There was no escape. Photo: James Cross Source: Supplied \nThe rest of the evening was quite pleasant for the most part as we were now immune to shock and so used to sexual harassment that it seemed as regular as a “good evening to you sir”. The fire dancers and DJ were welcome relief to what had been, up until this point, complete and utter disappointment and by midnight that sandpaper bed was starting to appeal. \nThe alcohol and sleep deprivation was slowly but surely sending me off to sleep so I took one final look at the lads, who were doing eyeball shots, and headed to my room to sweat until sunrise. \nThe music was blaring until 6am as a number of people had decided to do an all-nighter. I got out of my bunk carefully, trying not to wake up the three naked Irish girls on the top bunks, who couldn’t have found more unflattering and revealing positions to twist their bodies into. I was then met outside by one of my group who was also an early riser. \n“Don’t go up there,” she said. “They’re doing lines of their own vomit off the floor.” \nRighto. I decided to go for a morning swim and to then have a shower as we had been told the night before that the polluted water gives you a rash. \nCheck-out was at 10am and needless to say we were at the front of the queue to retreat along with some newcomers — who refused to stay the two nights. I’m certain such scenes of desperation to get on a boat haven’t been observed since Dunkirk. \nOn true form, the Irish lads had not only been vomiting and hadn’t washed, they had also stolen eggs from the kitchen and egged each other prior to departure. The six-hour journey back to Hanoi was a painful one. \nThe final convoy, which lasted 2.5 hours, was comprised of one large bus and one mini bus, which could barely fit everyone in as the company had not expected some of the new people to want to leave early. \nConsequently, some of the poor girls in my group had sticky egg/vomit boys passing out on them for the duration. \nCastaways was the low point of my time in Vietnam and in earnest my entire travel history … and I’ve volunteered to shovel vulture vomit in 35 degree heat. \nThere were no sad goodbyes and no comments like “I wish we had longer”. \nIn the end, we all just looked at each other in silent sympathy, happy in the knowledge that we had made it and that tonight we would be far, far away. What stunning Halong Bay looks like in the tourist brochures.
