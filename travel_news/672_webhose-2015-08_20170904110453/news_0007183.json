Alberto Font/The Tico Times \nJuan Santamaría International Airport ( SJO ) inaugurated on Tuesday two new waiting areas and two new boarding bridges that will allow for larger aircraft. \nThe expansion project, which also includes room for shops, restaurants and other businesses, represents a $19 million investment by terminal administrator Aeris Holding Costa Rica . \nThe new facilities expand the terminal by 2,668 square meters along two floors. \nThe construction features environmentally-friendly design for air conditioning, and energy-saving lighting systems, the terminal’s executive director Rafael Mencia said at the opening. There’s also a system to collect rainwater for reuse at the airport, he added. \nThe expansion comes on top of recent investments unveiled in April, including a new building for administrative staff, new security and surveillance facilities, a new wall and other security improvements to the terminal’s perimeter. \nAeris also plans to begin construction on new facilities for cargo and domestic flights later this year. The project will require an additional $20 million and is expected to be ready by next year. \nSJO, outside of San José, is Costa Rica’s main air terminal. Last year, just over 3.5 million travelers passed through SJO, a 5.1 percent increase over 2013, according to Aeris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:30:04.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
