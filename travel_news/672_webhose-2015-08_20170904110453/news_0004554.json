Eat healthily, avoid caffeine and be well hydrated.\n2 At the airport don’t be tempted to sit around as this is the worst thing you can do. Stay active and you won’t feel so sluggish when you board the flight.\n3 On the day you are travelling and when you arrive eat a healthy meal with fresh fruit and vegetables. Avoid caffeine and refined sugars and heavily salted plane food if possible. Take snacks to eat on board such as oat cakes, nuts and dried fruit, crudites and fresh fruit.\n4 Take a large bottle of water on the plane and herbal tea bags so you can still have a hot drink. Avoid caffeine and alcohol .\n5 Close your eyes and meditate on take-off and landing for 20 minutes each time.\nGetty Steer clear: Coffee is full of caffeine and should be avoided\n6 Get up out of your seat and move around regularly. This will improve blood flow and stop you feeling too lethargic.\n7 If you have to work, do so for only a short time, then put your laptop and papers away and choose some relaxing inflight entertainment to enjoy.\n8 Put the emphasis on resting rather than sleeping. Use products that use lavender oils or eucalyptus such as tissues or scented flight cushions. Use an eye mask and ear plugs and put a “do not disturb” sign on your table if you don’t want to be woken for meals or duty free sales.\n9 At your destination try not to nap until it’s time to sleep. You must synchronise to your destination to beat jetlag, so if you feel sleepy go for a walk. Eat light, as feeling too full will add to your tiredness. Stay hydrated and avoid alcohol.\n10 Avoid taking any medication to help you sleep. Your body needs to naturally adjust to the time zone and you disrupt this process using medication. If you can’t sleep, just lie down and think about having a rest – it’s likely you will drift off to sleep anyway.\nsilentnight.co.uk/sleep-matters\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.silentnight.co.uk/sleep-matters/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-08-09T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T16:40:20.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
