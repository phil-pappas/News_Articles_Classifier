On its daily nonstop flights from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , Aer Lingus' new business class includes lie-flat seats that extend to a very generous 6 and 1/2 feet. Aer Lingus also has cleverly branded its business class experience as a product that provides \"four rooms in the sky,\" namely areas to sleep, work, eat and unwind. In addition to the flatbed seats, tray tables at each seat are large enough to accommodate both a meal service and a laptop at the same. To help travelers adjust to substantial time differences on long international flights, Aer Lingus serves meals in the air based on time of day on the ground. Menus are changed four times a year to reflect seasonal ingredient availabilities in Ireland. Interior decor in Aer Lingus business cabins features woven fabrics made at the country's last remaining textile mill in Dublin. Business class passengers on Aer Lingus also get most of the other amenities familiar to regular international business class customers on several airlines, including amenity kits, duvets, pillows, eyeshades and socks. Noted Jack Foley , Aer Lingus executive vice president for North America: \"Business Class is designed to reflect Irish hospitality alongside the trends of modern Ireland. Our Business Class is the smartest and most comfortable way to travel to Ireland, Europe and the U.K.\" In addition to a regular daily flight between O'Hare and Dublin, Aer Lingus offers a second flight on Monday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday during the peak summer travel season. \nGet Chicago  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:26:53.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
