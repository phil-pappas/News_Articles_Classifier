He succeeds Jeff Hull, who is retiring from Matson after a 33-year career with the company. Wagner reports to Matt Cox, president and chief executive officer, and is based at Matson’s corporate office in Oakland, California.\nWagner most recently served as public information officer and spokesman for Oakland International Airport. Prior to that, he served as vice president of public affairs at Hawaiian Airlines, based in Honolulu. During his more than 20 years at Hawaiian, he led internal and external communications during an historic period of change and growth, including numerous changes in leadership, ownership and two Chapter 11 reorganizations.\nHull spent the first eight years of his Matson career in the company’s personnel department, including three years as editor of the employee magazine, IMUA! He has been head of Matson’s public relations department since 1990. Hull has been responsible for directing communications for Matson and its subsidiaries, both externally and internally. The scope of his responsibilities encompassed media relations, marketing communications, social media and internal communications. He also oversaw the company’s historical archives.\n“Keoni’s extensive communications background, coupled with his deep knowledge of Hawaii and the transportation industry, make him a valuable new member of Matson’s senior management team,” said Matt Cox, president and CEO. “Jeff has had a long, distinguished career at Matson, and will be missed. On a personal note, I’d like to thank Jeff for all he’s done over the years for Matson and wish him all the best during his well-earned retirement.”\nSource:-Matson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:14:29.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
