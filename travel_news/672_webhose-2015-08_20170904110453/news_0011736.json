Established in the Seventies, its initial brief was to work on BMW's racing programme. It took the European championships by storm with modified versions of the first-generation 3 Series, winning European Touring Cars in 1987, then looked round for what to do next. The answer was to apply its racing know-how to BMW's road cars, with astonishing success. The M badge has since graced everything from the stunning M1 and M635 CSi of the late Seventies and early Eighties, via the instantly recognisable Z3 M roadster of the Nineties, right up to one of the biggest bruisers of all time: the birth of the 3-litre, triple turbocharged diesel M-tuned engine. M cars feature specially tuned suspension for a more dynamic drive This engine sits in the M550d and its estate counterpart in Europe, and the X5 M50d SUV and the contentiously styled X6 M50d crossover in the UK. The unit produces 381bhp and 546lb-ft of torque, which means monstrous performance at low revs. This first diesel engine for the M division was launched in 2012 to a very surprised public, who had equated M badges with peaky petrol magic until then. But there’s no arguing with the performance figures. As well as tuned engines, M cars feature specially tuned suspension for a more dynamic drive, plus different engine and transmission mountings, springs, dampers, and mapping for the hydraulic steering. BMW’s canny introduction of diesel has done nothing to dampen the attraction of the M badge; in fact it has simply shown the innovation and blue-sky thinking the performance unit is capable of. After all, if it is willing to apply the badge to four-wheel drive cars as well as its traditional rear-wheel-drive stable, who knows what’s next? The M division remains an extremely attractive and premium offering for BMW’s loyal customers, as well as attracting new sales from those who’ve always lusted after an early Nineties M3 Cabrio, or dreamt about an 850 CSi/M8. Or is that just me? Do you want to help look after your engine? Non-premium fuels can, over time, cause gunk to build-up on critical fuel system components such as diesel engine fuel injectors – which can rob engines of power. Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel is formulated to help recover engine power lost to performance-robbing deposits. Shell's advanced formulation is designed to work under the extreme conditions of the fuel injection system, breaking down and cleaning away harmful gunky deposits. Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel is also designed to form a protective film on metal surfaces, which decreases the corrosion rate, helping to protect precision fuel system components.
