A letter from the President and CEO of Truck It Smart:\nThe #1 question I get asked from independent owner operators around the country at trade shows is \"Do you display the rates in your search results?\" I am pleased to announce that we at Truck It Smart \"listen\" and have made the provision in our software version 3.6 for shippers and brokers to provide and display rates a requirement and give priority to rated loads received from third parties. When discussing the provision of rates, aka pricing, the challenge has always been how to please both the carrier and broker. We aren't going to please everyone, all the time, but the time is right for our industry to move to the next level and that is not a matter of if this approach gets fully adopted, but when it becomes the industry standard. We know that your time is important, so why waste it on a cheap load? Our approach is simple. It's all about speed and transparency. I have seen other industries transformed by similar open practices. It is innovative and it will be an industry first for transportation. I need your help to make it successful â€“ So be a part of the change, and join the Truck It Smart Team.\nRegister your comments and support on our site www.TruckItSmart.com or at our booth, #15169, at The Great American Trucking Show.\nAt Truck It Smart we pride ourselves on being the easiest and most user-friendly load board.
