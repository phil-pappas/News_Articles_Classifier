The firm say compensation could amount in up to £610m of past claims for Ryanair.\nIn a statement, Ryanair said, “”Since we believe a six-year time limit for submitting such claims is both unnecessary and unreasonable, we have instructed our lawyers to immediately appeal this ruling.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:18:54.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
