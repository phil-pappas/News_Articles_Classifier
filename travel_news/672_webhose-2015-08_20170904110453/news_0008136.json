This makes him the right man to take the reins in Sharjah as we fly the TIME Hotels flag across the Emirates,” said Mohamed Awadalla, CEO, TIME Hotels.\nA Lebanese national and US-certified hotel and restaurant diploma holder, Farhat is tasked with developing TIME Ruby Hotel Apartments’ position as a leading midscale destination in the emirate.\n“Our prime location in the busy Al Khan area, close to the sea and within easy reach of Sharjah’s business and leisure facilities, gives us the opportunity to develop both market segments as well as showcase the brand attributes and appeal to a wider audience,” said Farhat.\nRounding out the new executive line-up is Kamal Abou Fares, who joins the corporate team as Marketing & Communications Director. Currently studying for his Masters in Strategic Marketing, Fares is a business graduate of the American University of Beirut and has worked for international hospitality chains, Radisson and Millennium Hotels, in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n“This is a pivotal role in TIME Hotels’ corporate framework with responsibility for the dissemination of key messages and communication of our ground-breaking environmental and CSR initiatives to the media, general public and partners across the region. Kamals’ enthusiasm and experience makes him the crucial lynchpin between our hotels and our guests,” said Awadalla.\nDevelopment of TIME Hotel’ knowledge capital and human resources talent is a priority for the rapidly expanding brand according to CEO, Mohamed Awadalla. “With demand for mid-scale hotels within the region growing more quickly than any other segment right now, and the increasingly budget-conscious mind-set of a large percentage of Middle Eastern business travellers, this puts us in pole position to reach out to customers across the region for whom value for money combined with quality, and the added bonus of the comfort factor of a ‘local’ brand, is key,” he said.\n“And so as we grow our portfolio we are also investing time and resources in recruiting the best people for the brand,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:21:35.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
