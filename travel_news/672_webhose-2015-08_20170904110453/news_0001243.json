While planning your holiday in the Golden State do not miss out on the incredible theme parks the Country promises to have. Ranging from Disneyland classics to beachfront carousels, the Golden State’s best-in-class theme parks deliver amusement to everyone. One can take a tram ride to tour movie back lots at Universal Studios Hollywood, or ride on a beachfront carousel in Santa Cruz. The Joyous ride to the theme parks is open for all age group and is equally a matter of fun for both kids and elders.\n1. Disney Land Resort- The Disney Land Resort theme parks has been leading the way since 1955, inviting visitors to spend the day in the ultimate land of make-believe. This beloved Anaheim institution serves up vintage icons like the Matterhorn Bobsleds as well as new innovations, like laser lights and soaring fountains in the nightly show World of Color, or mystical mouse antics in Mickey and the Magical Map. The resort, which consists of the original Disneyland Park and the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park, has themed “lands” with related rides, shows, and attractions.The Park is equipped with all mosern facilities to make things easier for the visitors. It has free map handy to make sure one is heading in the right direction (with all the different “lands” and activities it’s easy to get a bit disoriented). After getting in, reduce wait time in lines by using the resort’s Fast Pass system (one can use the ticket to book a dedicated time later in the day). And also free Disneyland Wait Time app can be downloaded to know where to head next for shortest line.\n2. Universal Studios Hollywood – Movie magic, mega attractions – If Hollywood is the land of make believe, then this is the right chance to step into that fantasy world. On a sprawling complex on the east side of the Hollywood Hills, this movie studio/part theme park blends behind-the-scenes tours with rides that swoosh, swoop, and dive through movie-themed worlds. An adjacent, neon-lit complex of shops, eateries, and entertainment spaces known as Universal City Walk lets you stretch out the experience beyond the park.\n3. LEGOLAND California – It is hard to say who enjoys LEGOLAND more: the little ones running around in a magical world created by 60 million LEGO plastic bricks, or their parents who get a kick out of it too. Walk through Miniland USA for a visual and structural jaw-dropper: expansive miniaturized recreations of Washington D.C., New York, and San Francisco, as well as scenes from Star Wars. There’s also a chance to go behind-the-scenes to look at the soundstage and models used during the LEGO Movie. While the focus here leans towards making little ones smile, there’s plenty to entertain older visitors too: the park has more than 60 rides, shows, and attractions, including three rollercoaster’s.\n4. SeaWorld San Diego – From swooshing and swooping rides to interactive shows and million-gallon aquariums, this theme park truly makes a big, big splash. One can See and learn about the amazing undersea worlds of animals from around the globe, including walruses, sea lions, polar bears, and penguins. Also one can See (and touch) harmless rays and sharks, and be entertained by Shamu and other killer whales, as well as dolphins, in daily shows and presentations.\n5. KNOTTS BERRY – Takes Pride in claiming itself to have more world-class roller coasters than any other destination. This theme park, roughly an hour’s drive northeast of Los Angeles is certainly a daredevil’s paradise. Teens and young adults flock here to get spun, flung, and plummeted on rides with names like Goliath, Twisted Colossus, Viper, Sling Shot, and Apocalypse. Comic-book heroes get a nod here too, as on the Superman: Escape from Krypton mega-ride. If one needs a place to settle the brain back into the skull, or the little ones who aren’t quite ready to ride a chair upside down at 65 miles/105 km per hour, head for mellower Bugs Bunny World, with pint-size rides and dressed-up Looney Tunes characters saying hi to the kids. For a cool retreat in summer, one can bring bathing suits and head to adjacent Hurricane Harbor to have a slip and slide on more than 20 water slides, also a ride to a make-believe African river, and relaxing time beside a tropical lagoon. The harbor is open May through September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:41:49.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
