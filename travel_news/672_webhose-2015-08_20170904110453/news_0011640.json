It is located on the north shore of Prince Edward Island and is divided into 3 separate parts: Cavendish in the west, Brackley-Dalvay in the center, and Greenwich in the east. \nThe most popular segment of the park is the central part which pretty much a really long beach. I visited on a weekday in August and I couldnâ€™t find a parking spot along this segment. It seemed like most of PEI had come out to enjoy the beach. Even though the air temperature was warm, the water temperature was still pretty cold, as the water was part of the northern Atlantic. Most people were on the beach and not out swimming. \nThe easternmost segment of the park, Greenwich, is very different. Here you will find more nature and fewer people. There are several trails which will let you see different coastal ecosystems in a very small area, including forests, salt marshes and sand dunes. \nVisiting PEI National Park is very easy if you are on the island. It is approximately a 30 minute drive from the capital of Charlottetown and about a 2 hour drive from Moncton, NB, including the drive over the Confederation Bridge. \nCamping is available at the park and there are a great many hotels on the island in easy driving distance.
