Virgin Australia will be able to utilise this innovative feature that enables airlines to market and retail their products more effectively by determining how their products are visually presented and described to travel agents. It is designed to allow airlines to use more sophisticated retailing techniques in order to drive sales of core fares as well as ancillary products and optional services such as seats with extra legroom and lounge passes. \nVirgin Australia is preparing to launch new Business Class suites on its A330 aircraft which fly between Perth and the East Coast of Australia and its B777 aircraft which fly from Australia to Los Angeles and Abu Dhabi. The Premium Economy cabin on the airline’s B777 aircraft will also undergo a major redesign, providing more legroom than any other Australian airline and a new Premium Larder. Travelport’s Rich Content and Branding solution will enable Virgin Australia to communicate the features of these exciting new products and services to all Travelport-connected agencies globally using both text and graphics. Virgin Australia Chief Commercial Officer Judith Crompton said: “We are committed to delivering a superior experience for our guests at all times on their journey. Travelport’s Rich Content and Branding solution will enable us to share details of exciting products and services such as our new Business Class suite with travel agents around Australia and worldwide.” Damian Hickey, Vice President, Asia Pacific and Global Sales Strategy, Air Commerce, Travelport, added: “Travelport’s Rich Content & Branding is the perfect complement to Virgin Australia’s customer experience goals. Our solution is about empowering airlines to create great choices for their customers and to clearly communicate those choices. Virgin Australia’s goal is to create the preferred flying experience through great choices. What a match! I am just delighted that we are making our long-standing partnership even better.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:00:11.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
