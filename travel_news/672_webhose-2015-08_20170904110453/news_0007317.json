As a result, several key features of the Encore system include:\nAll Encore games rely solely on the results of horse races, and not on any random draws, random number generation or other random elements to determine the outcome of wagers; The Encore system is strictly pari-mutuel, and does not rely on a \"house-banked\" system to maintain pari-mutuel wagering pool integrity; and All Encore games are based on a pre-existing ARCI approved pari-mutuel wager. In addition to its Answer, Encore filed a counterclaim alleging that RaceTech violated anti-trust laws and engaged in a conspiracy with other named entities to deprive Encore of access to historical horseracing data. \"RaceTech engaged in anti-competitive behavior in violation of the Sherman Act and the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, and we are asking the Court to hold them accountable for those actions,\" concluded Stein.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150211/174951LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encore-responds-to-latest-racetech-lawsuit-files-counterclaim-alleging-racetech-engaged-in-conspiracy-violated-antitrust-laws-300130671.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL82780&Transmission_Id=201508191040PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL82780&DateId=20150819", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150211/174951LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150211/174951LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/encore-responds-to-latest-racetech-lawsuit-files-counterclaim-alleging-racetech-engaged-in-conspiracy-violated-antitrust-laws-300130671.html"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:17:59.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
