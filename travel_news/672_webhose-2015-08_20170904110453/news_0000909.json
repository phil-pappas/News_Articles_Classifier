They are on pace to raise £68,000 ($106,000), unless donations pick up.\n Next A street food feast, takeaway picnic hampers and a spread...

We settled on Minas Tirith, as we felt it represented the most realistic and sustainable project.\n‘Obviously we realise that we are venturing into unchartered territory as far as crowdfunding is concerned, but we’ve been blown away by the amount of interest that our project has generated. The positive reaction to the campaign gives me a faint hope that we can reach our target.’\n‘I think it’s perfectly reasonable for people to doubt our prospects of success. What I don’t agree with are the people who say there are more worthwhile projects to which we should be devoting our time.\n‘That’s a principle that, if you choose to, you can apply to virtually any aspect of life. We’re trying to achieve something that will be ground-breaking, unique and a real boost to both the local and national economy.’", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1TxzwyV"], "published": "2015-08-13T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:24:34.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
