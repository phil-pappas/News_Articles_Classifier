No birthday party was complete without a bowl of Rowntree’s strawberry jelly, served with a dollop of Wall’s ice cream. But if you thought the stuff had been consigned to the dustbin of culinary history, you’d be wrong. Jelly is back – in all its wibbly, wobbly wonderful glory. Only this time, it’s gone a bit... adult. Take the Bison Grill bistro on the Rhug Estate in Wales. There’s no custard or squirty cream involved in the home-made jelly here: instead, it’s flavoured with zingy citrus and dished up with burnt orange segments and an indulgent, oozing orange syrup. At Salthouse Harbour Hotel in Suffolk, you can round off your meal with a stylish dessert of apple and Hendricks’s Gin jelly, with a refreshing cucumber sorbet. Jelly's unique texture lends itself to experimentation But it’s on the savoury side of the menu that things really get interesting. At the Japanese restaurant Engawa in London, you can tuck into melt-in-the-mouth, slow-cooked Kobe beef and jelly flavoured with ponzu (a tart, citrus-based sauce), dramatically served on a block of ice. Even Engawa’s executive chef, Akira Shimizu, admits that jelly and beef are strange bedfellows. “That’s what makes it all the more fun,” he says. “One has childhood connotations while the other is the caviar of cattle, proper grown-up food. So people are intrigued. “There’s a child in all of us – using jelly is an excuse to regress a little and to enjoy food while not being too serious.” Fruit jelly The current craze for jelly among adults can be partially credited to the self-proclaimed “jellymongers” Bompas & Parr . Friends Sam Bompas and Harry Parr are food artists whose jubilant gelatin sculptures – from a translucent rendition of Norman Foster’s “wobbly” Millennium Bridge to a glow-in-the-dark alcoholic jelly for the musician Mark Ronson’s 33rd birthday party – have helped bring jelly back with a belly-jiggling bang. But jelly actually has a long history in Britain, having wobbled its way from medieval banquet tables to the elaborate centrepieces of the Victorian era. In the early days, making jelly wasn’t easy – cooks had the rather unenviable task of extracting collagen from animal connective tissue and bone, typically calves’ feet, ivory shavings and pigs’ skins. The invention of “portable” powdered gelatin in the 1800s made the task much more pleasant, and meant that jelly’s place in the pantheon of dessert history was well and truly set. Strawberry jelly The fashion for sophisticated jellies has now reached the home cook. This summer, supermarket shelves are stocked with adult-friendly raspberry jelly terrines ( Waitrose ) and retro pink lemonade jelly cubes coated with damson purée ( Marks & Spencer ), for an on-the-go jelly hit. And cookbooks are stuffed full of easy-to-do recipes at home, from Rachel de Thample’s plum and liquorice jelly in her new book, Five ( Telegraph Bookshop , £14.99), to James Martin’s raspberry jelly with lime syrup in his recent Home Comforts ( Telegraph Bookshop , £20). Chefs say jelly offers more than the chance for nostalgic childhood flashbacks. It looks stunning on the plate, while the texture is truly unique, allowing for all kinds of experimentation. At St John restaurant in London, chef and founder Fergus Henderson has been extolling the virtues of savoury jelly for what seems like aeons, with jellied ham and jellied tripe featuring regularly on his menu. “There’s a coming of age with jelly. Suddenly you appreciate the wobble and the melting give in the savoury department – a hard thing to grasp when young,” Henderson says. Crayfish jelly Photo: HAARALA HAMILTON Shimizu agrees that jelly can be pivotal to the whole feel of a dish. “When our ponzu jelly hits the tongue, all those suspended flavours flood the mouth, creating a wonderful melting sensation that really compliments the beef,” he says. “It’s a unique experience you can only really achieve with jelly.” It seems the love affair between woman, man and wobble has never been stronger.
