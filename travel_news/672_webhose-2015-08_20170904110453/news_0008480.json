Comedian Matt Lucas writes heartfelt... You don't scare me! Plucky cat Felix stands its ground... Meet Princess Yellow Feather the latest internet star:... Spectators' horror as fearless stuntman is thrown off SUV's... But suddenly it gets to its feet and with its head down – as if in a stalking position – begins walking towards him.\nThe video maker reacts in panic and starts shouting at the mountain lion in the hope of snapping it out of its predatory state and scaring it away.\nThe cougar got to its feet and with its head down walked towards the filmmaker (left) before becoming distracted and looking off to its right (right)\nThe mountain lion walked off down a grass verge but stopped and crouched while looking at the man through the trees\nBut at first the cougar doesn’t appear to be too bothered by the noise coming from the man, and although it momentarily stops in its tracks, it continues to look over towards him.\nThe cougar then looks off to its right and begins descending the grass verge – it is unclear at this point whether the predator is heading off or whether it is looking for another way around to the man.\nIt then crouches down on all-fours and appears to be focusing on the man before getting ready to strike.\nRealising that he could well be in danger, the video maker shouts at the animal again in a desperate bid to scare it away.\nThe cougar walked away from the man and appeared to be heading off but looked over in his direction every so often\nBut the mountain lion continues to wander slowly towards him and can be heard breaking branches as it crawls through the thicket.\nThe cougar then begins walking away from the man but carries on looking over towards him every so often to check him out.\nLater in the video the mountain lion takes one last look at the filmmaker before heading off into the trees and becoming hidden from view.\nThe video concluded with the video maker turning the camera on himself and stating that the experience was awesome\nThe clip concludes with the man turning the camera around to film himself and acknowledging that he was worried the animal was going to attack him before commenting that the experience was awesome.\nMountain lion attacks are very rare as the predators do not generally recognise humans as prey.\nAttacks may occur when juveniles leave their mothers and look for their own territory or if the animal is suffering from severe starvation, however.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ITGyOw"], "published": "2015-08-03T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:34:16.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
