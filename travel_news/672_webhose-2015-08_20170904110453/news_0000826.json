Imagine losing a key and the amount of tension it can lead to,” says Nawal Kishore. \nThe artist’s latest works depict similar nuances of life, and his upcoming solo exhibition is thus titled Life Series. \nPainted in bright colours, the canvases created by Kishore exude positivity. “There was a time when I used to paint hoardings and posters for films in Lucknow. My positive attitude towards life made me acquire further skills in the field of art.” \nA look at the paintings and the painter’s love with female form is visible at the first instance itself. Alongside depicting the relationship between human and the spiritual world, Kishore also uses the technique of overlapping faces. “If you look carefully, the faces on which there is no cap are male, and the rest are female. I purposely use geometric forms, because without them, I feel thateverything is incomplete in this world,” he adds. \nIn one of the paintings, a group of girls is seated together. Kishore explains, “They are gossiping. Also, there is a clock inside a box in the same painting. It shows how both men and women want to lock their beauties in a box, so that they never age.” \nThe works also attract a viewer’s eye due to their texture. Kishore informs that he has mixed acrylic colour with a medium that gives an embossing effect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T19:38:30.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
