While the sector had reported increased revenues in the first quarter, officials predict a decline of $5 billion in tourism revenue by the end of the year.\nHeightened security risks have forced foreign tourists to cancel their travel plans to Turkey and officials predict a further decline in their numbers.\nTerrorist attacks, violence in neighbouring Syria has contributed to the rising insecurity which in turn contributed to a decline in revenue from Turkey’s tourism sector.\nTurkey saw a 13.8 percent drop in the second quarter of the year, down $7.73 billion compared with the same period in 2014, according to data from the Turkish Statistics Institute.\nA report by the World Travel & Tourism Council estimates that travel and tourism generated roughly 12 percent, or $96 billion, of Turkey’s GDP last year. Thus, the loss in tourism revenue will cost dearly to the country.\nThe outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), have in the past, targeted tourist sites. Recently, gunmen opened fire outside of Istanbul’s Dolmabahce Palace, while at least eight Turkish soldiers were killed in a bomb attack attributed to PKK.\nTour operators and hotels reported a decline in reservations with the decrease in the number of foreign tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:03:37.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
