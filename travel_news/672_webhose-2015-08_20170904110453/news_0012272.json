The Car Care Council recommends that motorists brush up on their auto care knowledge to make sure their vehicle is operating at its most efficient level before the school year carpool crunch and the onset of fall and winter weather.\nThe ABCs of basic car care include:\nA – Always follow a vehicle service schedule. B – Be sure to have your car inspected when you suspect there is a problem. C – Correct the problem to help avoid the inconvenience and potential safety hazards of breaking down away from home. \"Many people simply don't take the time to care for their vehicle properly,\" said Rich White , executive director, Car Care Council. \"By following these three simple steps, motorists will not only protect their second largest investment, but they will be able to address minor repairs before they become more complicated, expensive repairs.\"\nTo make it easier for motorists to follow a preventative vehicle maintenance plan, the non-profit Car Care Council recommends that drivers sign up for the council's free personalized service schedule and email reminder service and keep a copy of its popular Car Care Guide in the glove box. The 80-page guide is a valuable tool that can be ordered free of charge at www.carcare.org/car-care-guide .\nThe Car Care Council is the source of information for the \"Be Car Care Aware\" consumer education campaign promoting the benefits of regular vehicle care, maintenance and repair to consumers.
