Striking landscapes and diverse climates combine to create some truly spectacular flavours on the country’s dinner plates. The vast island continent stretches from icy cold Antarctic waters in the south to tropical rainforests in the north, turning it into a food wonderland. You really can get everything you want, from prime Victorian wagyu beef, to Queensland king prawns, Sydney rock oysters, Hervey Bay scallops and Kinkawooka mussels. It’s why food lovers are re-calibrating their radars and flying to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth from all over the world. Gastronomically speaking, it is Australia’s time in the sun (as if they don’t have more than their fair share of that already). In fact, British holidaymakers who have enjoyed a sojourn Down Under rank Australia as their No1 destination for food and wine. Seafood delight: don’t miss your chance to savour Hervey Bay scallops The best way to find out what’s on the menu is to head straight for a market – the historic Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne, Adelaide’s charming Central Market, or Sydney’s awesome Fish Market, the home of Australian seafood. Farmers' markets have sprung up in almost every region across Australia and should be the first stop for anyone with a picnic basket. At the charming Eveleigh Organic Markets at Sydney’s historic Carriageworks, you can breakfast on steamed pork buns from celebrity chef Kylie Kwong; and at Hobart’s Salamanca Markets, you can chat to farmers, grab a bratwurst in a roll, and pack a hamper full of home-made pies. For the ultimate market experience, get yourself to tropical Darwin for the famous Mindil Beach Sunset Market. Sitting on the golden beach with a bowl of Thai green mango salad and prawns, while the sun sets like melting orange jelly into the Arafura Sea, is a truly unforgettable experience. Fresh fruit and veg: take a stroll around Eveleigh Market in Sydney Interestingly, in these global times, Australians are becoming more Australian, shrugging off the mantle of colonial outpost and allowing their food and wine to define who they are by where they are. The country’s top chefs are discovering what Australia’s indigenous people have known for 40,000 years: that this huge, dry, ancient country is home to countless wild, native plants, succulents, herbs, nuts, seeds and berries. At Orana in Adelaide, Scottish-born Jock Zonfrillo turns native ingredients foraged from all over the country into a unique cuisine that is both contemporary and timeless. Sea-sweet Kangaroo Island scallops are teamed with salty iceplant; charred kangaroo tartare with native gubbinge plum, grass and wild garlic, and mud crab with sea succulents such as karkalla and sea purslane. In Melbourne, Ben Shewry of Attica (currently ranked at No32 in the World’s 50 Best Restaurants) regularly forages for seaweeds and wild weeds along the Great Ocean Road to inspire a multi-course menu of wallaby black pudding pikelets with foam and flowers, King George whiting cooked in paperbark, and red kangaroo with hot-and-sour quandongs (bush peaches). It wouldn’t be Australia if great food and wine weren’t readily accessible at every level, from high-end to the street Not surprisingly for a nation in love with the backyard barbecue, another “hot” ingredient is wood. Some of the country’s finest chefs are turning off the gas and turning instead to mallee root, iron bark and fruit wood to fuel their grills and ovens. At Sydney’s Firedoor, former Etxebarri chef, Lennox Hastie, matches the wood to the ingredient, smoking butter over applewood and aged rib-eye steak over vine shoots. In Hobart, Franklin chef David Moyle treats local produce with raw honesty, cooking whole roasted local pigeons in his wood-fired Scotch oven. At Brisbane’s renowned Esquire, chef Ryan Squires slow-roasts Tasmanian salmon tail over the glowing coals, while at Australia’s ultimate steakhouse, Rockpool Bar & Grill in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, chef Neil Perry insists on the extra dimension of char and smokiness the fire gives his dry-aged, grass-fed beef. The elephant in the room – or perhaps the camel – is Australia’s sheer size. Do not try to fly like a maddened mosquito from one capital city to the other. Choose one or two destinations, and do them properly. Hire a car and drive into the country, through rolling hills, around inland crater lakes, and deep into the bush in search of truly Australian food experiences. Relative newcomer Brae in Victoria’s Otway hinterland is one to aim for, where chef Dan Hunter raids his own organic gardens for the day’s menu. Social scene: Rockpool Bar & Grill in Melbourne is a must-visit Luckily, there is a growing trend for “restaurants with rooms” that turn Australia’s distances into a google map of adult sleep-overs. Check out Victoria’s award-winning Lake House in Daylesford, Biota Dining and Rooms in New South Wales’ southern highlands or Appellation @ The Louise in the Barossa Valley, and dine with the comforting knowledge that a soft pillow is a stroll away. Of course, luxury is easy to find if you want to dine in real style. But it wouldn’t be Australia if great food and wine weren’t readily accessible at every level, from high-end to the street. Take the great Australian café, home to ethically sourced coffee beans, creamy “flat whites” and gleaming La Marzocco espresso machines. Café chefs have raised breakfast and lunch to an artform, whether it’s smashed avocado on toast, sweetcorn fritters or healthy bowls of spiced grains and hung yoghurt. Look out for the Boathouse cafés and The Grounds of Alexandria in Sydney; Betsey in Hobart; St Ali, Market Lane and Proud Mary in Melbourne (Australia’s coffee heart-land); Strauss in Brisbane; Exchange and Coffee Branch in Adelaide; Elixir in Perth; Cartel Roasters in Geelong (Vic); and Three Bean Espresso in Newcastle (NSW). British holidaymakers rank Australia as their No1 destination for food and wine That same sense of fair play extends to wine experiences. You can either fork out for a helicopter to whisk you to Leeuwin Estate in the Margaret River, or just tootle up the highway an hour from Melbourne to the gorgeous Yarra Valley to meet Australia’s unique wildlife on a tour of the Healesville Sanctuary, followed by lunch at De Bortoli or Oakridge wineries. Even that cannot-be-missed cultural powerplant, the Sydney Opera House, is a great example of gastronomic democracy. On one level, you can sit on a shady terrace with Sydney Harbour at your feet, a beetroot burger or a spicy bowl of curry laksa at your side. On another level, you can book into the landmark Bennelong restaurant, where Australia’s most celebrated chef Peter Gilmore newly showcases the finest produce in Australia in elegant dishes that rival the ridiculously cinematic views. Start with a delicate rockpool of mussels, clams and onion shoots, go on to roasted John Dory with native saltbush, turnips and umami butter, and end with chic little pavlova of rhubarb, raspberry and Italian meringue, clad with impossibly crisp meringue Opera House “sails” – just in case you go into raptures and forget where you are.
