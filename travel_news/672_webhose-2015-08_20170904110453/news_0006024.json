Boston will become the fifth US destination as Norwegian’s ground-breaking transatlantic flights continue to prove popular with UK passengers.\nIn total Norwegian will add over 60,000 affordable seats between Boston and London over the next six months, helping to dramatically reduce the cost of travel to New England. The flights use state of the art 787 Dreamliner aircraft and will depart on Mondays, Wednesday, Fridays and Sundays. Norwegian will also be launching direct services to Boston from both Copenhagen and Oslo.\nNorwegian CEO Bjørn Kjos said : “Today we have launched the UK’s cheapest flight to Boston, helping to make this popular New England city affordable at long last.\n“Norwegian offers the UK’s only low-cost, long haul travel to the USA and Boston will become our fifth new destination since introducing our pioneering flights last year. We expect Boston to be a popular addition offering an exciting new city break, and providing affordable access to the New England region for both business and leisure travellers.\n“The cost of flying to America has been too high for too long, and the success of our transatlantic flights show there is huge demand for quality, affordable long haul travel. We are pleased to add Boston to our network from London Gatwick as we continue our exciting plans for UK growth.”\nSource:- Norwegian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:56:15.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
