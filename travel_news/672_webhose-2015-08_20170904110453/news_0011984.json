It's just not in their DNA to speak publicly about defence issues.\" \nA defence industry source in Tokyo said the German bid was shaping up as the one to beat. \n\"There is some concern in the Japanese government,\" said another industry source in Tokyo familiar with the proposals. \nBoth sources said Japanese defence ministry officials had informally asked U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . contractors with close ties to Japanese industry, including Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp , to advise Mitsubishi Heavy on managing its first ever bid to sell military equipment to an overseas government. \nNO SECRET DEAL \nAustralian media has said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe privately agreed last year that Japan would get the contract, which also involves maintenance of the vessels. Both sides have denied such a deal. \nThe issue dominated a news conference held by the Japanese delegation. \n\"The current situation has us a little bit perplexed and confused why such speculation is still being voiced,\" said Masaki Ishikawa, director general for acquisition reform at Japan's Ministry of Defence. \nIshikawa declined to be drawn on whether Japan would build the submarines in Australia. \nAbbott has described Japan as Australia's \"closest friend in Asia\". The United States is also keen to spur security cooperation between two key allies. \nOfficials in Adelaide, capital of South Australia state, insisted on at least 70 percent local worker participation in the project. \n\"The French and the Germans have been out there in the public domain making their case and, look, that's understandable because this is an argument that will be determined in the court of public opinion,\" South Australia defence minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said in an interview. \nInfluential independent Senator Nick Xenophon, who met with the delegation privately, told Reuters the Japanese had put themselves in a position to play catch up. \nSenator Sean Edwards, chairman of the economics committee in the upper house of Australia's parliament, said he had repeatedly told the Japanese officials the political importance of pledging to build in Australia. \n\"They get it,\" he told Reuters. \nThe Japanese declined to meet with labour union leaders, said Glenn Thompson, assistant national secretary of the powerful Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. \n\"We would have thought the Japanese ... would have liked to have talked to the unions,\" he said. \nEach of the bidders has been asked to provide three estimates: one for construction overseas, one for a partial assembly in Australia and one for a full build in an Australian shipyard. \nAn expert advisory council is expected to deliver its recommendation in November.
