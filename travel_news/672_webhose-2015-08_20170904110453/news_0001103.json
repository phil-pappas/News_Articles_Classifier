(Photo: Indiana Department of Transportation)\n242 CONNECT 110 TWEET LINKEDIN 17 COMMENT EMAIL MORE LAFAYETTE, Ind. — An I-65 bridge that dropped 9 inches last week while construction crews worked to widen it has closed 50 miles of a major artery between Indianapolis and Chicago.\nAnd northbound traffic on Interstate 65 will have to take a 60-mile detour around the bridge over Wildcat Creek for the foreseeable future, Indiana Department of Transportation officials said. Traffic is being diverted from I-65 just north of Lebanon, Ind., to U.S. 52, then to Indiana 28 at Clarks Hill and to U.S. 231 at Romney.\n\"We would hesitate to give any kind of timeline at this time,\" state highway Commissioner Brandye Hendrickson said. \"It will probably be later in the week before we really get our arms around some of the more viable solutions.\"\nAn average of 25,000 vehicles had been crossing the northbound Wildcat Creek bridge each day, according to a traffic count conducted earlier this year.\nUSA TODAY\nI-10 reopens but replacement bridge will cost $5M\n\"The full closure of a major interstate is understandably frustrating and difficult to bear,\" she said in asking for motorists' patience.\nProblems first closed the bridge abruptly at about 2:30 p.m. ET Aug. 4 when contractors noticed unusual movement in the bridge, which was being worked on as part of a project to widen the interstate to six lanes from four in the area. Officials believe soil conditions and an underground spring in addition to pile driving that began the previous day caused the bridge to settle.\nSome northbound motorists were trapped, so construction crews on the south side of the bridge laid down gravel, creating a lane to allow them to turn around. Just before 4 p.m., Indiana State Police blocked southbound traffic to allow semis and motorists to make a U turn on the newly created road.\nSince then, state officials opened the bridge, built in 1968, on the evening of Aug. 5 but closed it again Friday when they weren't satisfied with the stability of temporary steel supports. A May 19 inspection rated the Wildcat Creek bridge's substructure, piers and abutments to be in poor condition but other parts of the bridge were considered fair and satisfactory, so it was not closed then.\nLast month, an eastbound I-10 bridge over Tex Wash near Desert Center, Calif., collapsed during a major storm after fast-moving flood waters shifted dirt that held its foundation in place. A pickup truck was caught in the collapse, and its driver was trapped for three hours with two broken ribs, a shattered knee and lacerations to his liver.\nThe bridge about 175 miles east of Los Angeles, which carried about 20,000 vehicles per day and was part of the major link to Phoenix, had received an \"A\" rating last year, federal records showed.\nCalifornia Department of Transportation officials reopened that stretch of road July 24. But the westbound bridge is handling traffic in both directions, and state officials said rebuilding the collapsed span would take two months and $5 million.\nUSA TODAY\nTruck was half foot taller than I-35 bridge it mangled\nIn Indiana, using the southbound Wildcat Creek bridge to carry I-65 traffic in both directions is not an option, said Will Wingfield, an Indiana Transportation Department spokesman. Lanes would be too narrow even before adding a jersey barrier between the lanes of opposing traffic.\nNo estimate for the cost of repairs has been released.\nTraffic westbound on Indiana 26 was bumper to bumper Aug. 7, 2015, approaching U.S. 52 in Lafayette, Ind., as drivers tried to find additional ways to avoid the Wildcat Creek bridge over Interstate 65. (Photo: John Terhune, (Lafayette, Ind.) Journal and Courier)\nThe route for the detour, although long, was chosen to keep traffic off congested city streets in Lafayette, he said.\nTravelers had been spending as long as four hours in jammed traffic though officials added temporary traffic lights at key intersections over the weekend that reduced the drive time to closer to an hour.\nA 185-mile trip from Indianapolis to Chicago generally takes about 3 hours, according to Google Maps.\n\"It is a mess,\" Roy Westbrook of Valparaiso, Ind., said last week.\nSherman Wood, fleet manager for Fraley & Schilling in Rushville, Ind., said truck drivers will be hit in the pocketbook.\n\"They get paid by the mile, so for every minute they aren't moving, they aren't getting paid,\" Wood said.\nIf a delay is long enough, a driver could arrive at a store after it closes, which could mean a next-day delivery and a bigger loss, he said. Long traffic delays also could force drivers to take themselves off the road because they aren't allowed to drive more than 11 hours straight because of federal rules.\nPassenger bus services Greyhound and Megabus are telling customers to expect a half hour to an hour delay on routes through Lafayette. Amtrak could not say whether the number of riders on the Hoosier State passenger line from Indianapolis to Chicago has increased since the bridge closed.\nContributing: Ron Wilkins, (Lafayette, Ind.) Journal and Courier ; and John Tuohy, The Indianapolis Star\nTo avoid northwest Indiana Only the northbound lanes of Interstate 65 are closed, beginning north of Lebanon, Ind. Southbound traffic is traveling normally.\n• From Indianapolis: Take I-74 to I-57 in Champaign, Ill., then north to Chicago. That's 3 hours and 45 minutes to Interstate 80 in Chicago, according to Google Maps.\n• Another route: Take I-74 to U.S. 41 and then straight north. That's a 3-hour, 28-minute trip.\n• To Lafayette's south side: Take I-74 to Indiana 25 at Waynetown, Ind., north to Lafayette's south side. Estimated trip: 1 hours and 37 minutes.\n• To Lafayette's east side: Exit on Indiana 39 at Lebanon and head north to Frankfort. Go west on Indiana 28 to Mulberry/Jefferson Road. Follow that to Indiana 38 through Mulberry and into Lafayette. That's 1 hour and 31 minutes from Indianapolis.\n— Dave Bangert, (Lafayette, Ind.)
