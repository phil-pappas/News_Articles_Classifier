Greeks can currently withdraw only up to €420 a week.\nFrom Monday, the stock exchange will operate as normal for foreign investors but local traders will still face limits on their transactions as part of the capital controls imposed by the government.\nThe restrictions mean that Greek investors will not be able to finance the purchase of securities by taking money from their bank accounts in Greece. They will, however, be able to use foreign bank accounts or make cash transactions.\nAccording to news reports on Sunday, the top four lenders — National Bank, Piraeus Bank, Alpha Bank and Eurobank — will undergo an asset quality review later in August.\nStress tests will follow in the autumn to determine the recapitalisation requirements of each bank with European rescue funds.\nGreek officials want to complete the operation before new European regulations come into effect from January 1.\nAs of 2016, bank shareholders and depositors will foot the lion’s share of recapitalisation costs — a process known as \"bail-in\" — instead of European taxpayers.\nGreek banks were already recapitalised in 2013 with funds from the country’s last EU-IMF rescue package.\nThroughout the crisis, Greece’s cash-strapped banks have been kept afloat by a European Central Bank (ECB) credit facility known as emergency liquidity assistance (ELA).\nThe Frankfurt-based lender last week left the ELA unchanged at €90.4bn.\nFounded in 1876, the Athens stock exchange has closed down more than a dozen times in its history, the weekly To Vima reported on Sunday, most recently in 2008 owing to a strike by Bank of Greece staff.\nOther instances include the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, the First and Second World Wars, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, 1987’s \"Black Monday\" in the US and the outbreak of a stocks manipulation scandal in 1996.\nThe Greek economy is already forecast to contract by 3% this year by the Standard & Poor’s rating agency, but extended capital controls and a big bail-in could constrict activity even further.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:33:07.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
