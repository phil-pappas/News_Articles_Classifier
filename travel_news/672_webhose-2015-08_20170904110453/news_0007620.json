'Why, sometimes, I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.'\nOne impossible thought for some people could be: how on earth will I settle my bill? Because this is the most expensive hotel in Britain — by a long chalk.\nOverlooking Hyde Park Corner, The Lanesborough is an opulent recreation of 18th-century Regency London, where the cheapest room costs £720 a night.\nThe Lanesborough is an opulent recreation of 18th-century Regency London with rooms starting from £720 a night\nFor those who wish, a Royale Breakfast is an optional extra, and doesn't come cheap at £65 per person\nAdd in the Royale Breakfast at £65 per person (plus a 15 per cent service charge) and you're looking at £870 B&B.\nA couple of cocktails followed by dinner and wine in Celeste will set you back a further £400 per couple for the seven-course tasting menu, bringing the total to nearly £1,300.\nThis is nothing compared with a night in the Royal Suite, where the price jumps to £31,200.\nYes, you get seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, two living rooms and a dining room, but it's still a lot of spinach.\nWhen we arrived on a Friday evening, our Uber taxi (the hotel would have laid on its Rolls-Royce Phantom if only we had asked) was surrounded as if it were a super-charged F1 racing car making an emergency pit stop.\n 2 Next An Inspector Calls: The paint may be new and the...

Our bags vanished within seconds only to appear in our room long before we got there.\nWe were escorted down the handsome limestone corridor by various members of staff, all of whom could become the new face of L'Oreal if they ever need a career change.\nEn route, we passed three original paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds and learned later that the hotel has the largest collection of 18th-century paintings in the world outside any gallery.\nIt was 7.30pm, but an Arab couple were still enjoying afternoon tea in the yellow Withdrawing Room and the pianist was loosening up in the Library Bar next door.\nManagement of The Lanesborough — which was built as a private house by Viscount Lanesborough in 1719 before becoming the original St George's Hospital — was taken over 18 months ago by the German Oetker group.\nAn interior view of a spectacular dining area at the Lanesborough hotel in London, England\nThe Lanesborough's 93 guest rooms and suites, and all public areas have recently undergone an 18-month refurbishment\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Spain's very own Wild West in Fort Bravo/Texas Hollywood\nWatch video Story of Three Camel Lodge in The Gobi desert, Mongolia\nWatch video Discover the secluded beauty of Patagonia at Exlpora\nWatch video Ben Nevis from high above: Aerial filming with a drone\nWatch video Girl pops giant six-year-old pimple with disgusting results\nWatch video Dramatic footage shows aftermath of French train attack\nWatch video F-35A test fires 25mm 181 rounds gun at full capacity\nWatch video Perrie Edwards breaks down while singing Little Mix's The End\nWatch video Cliff Richard pays tribute to Cilla and sings Oh Faithful One\nWatch video YO!

It had a giant canopied bed, marble bathroom, huge chandelier, chintz sofa and chairs, lacquered dining room table (plus silver candelabra which would have had Liberace drooling).\nThere were two TVs, one housed in a gilt frame on the wall, the other hidden at the foot of the bed in a shiny cabinet, which rose into the air at the press of a button.\nThe only real concession to the 21st century were two infuriating Sony tablets, which turn lamps on and off, control the temperature, summon the butler and open and close the curtains.\nThe most lavish accommodation at the hotel is the seven-bedroom Royal Suite (pictured), which is £31,200 for the night\nAn interior view of the five-star Lanesborough hotel, once of the most lavish hotels in London, with personal butlers for guests\nBut it refused to open or close the curtains and I couldn't get to grips with the lighting — though I liked the way night lights came on when your feet touched the floor in the pitch dark.\nToiling in the kitchen is Florian Favario, a protege of Eric Frechon, whose restaurant at Le Bristol in Paris has three Michelin stars.\nYou can tell he's aiming for something similar by offering a starter called 'Cauliflower', which is really an over-sized canape of two florets creamed and roasted, infused with curry oil plus a sprinkling of parmesan cheese. Good, though.\nAnd you know you're in Michelin territory when you start longing for a side order of chips to go with your fillet steak or lamb chops, but my goodness both were delicious.\nWe opted for a table in the middle of the powder blue room and sat side by side on an upholstered sofa.\nThree massive chandeliers hung from the domed glass roof, illuminating the delicate bas-relief friezes, Wedgwood china and sculpted busts mounted on the walls.\nAt breakfast, our fruit salad was adorned with tiny strips of edible gold leaf curled around the strawberries. The full English was the best ever.\nThat was when we read the Lewis Carroll Quote: and took some comfort from it because amid the push for perfection and the money invested in this spectacular addition to the capital, no one had noticed that Carroll is spelt with two Rs.\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own trip to The Lanesborough The Lanesborough Hyde Park Corner, London SW1X 7TA 020 7259 5599, lanesborough.com\nDouble rooms from £720, room only.\nRead more: The Lanesborough London | Luxury Hotel in Knightsbridge", "external_links": ["http://lanesborough.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1PrBzU4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-22T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T14:08:31.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
