The awards pay tribute to the network’s most outstanding land partners, as recognized by their peers, and they were presented before an audience of close to 1,500 attendees during the Destination Showcase Dinner at Bellagio Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.\nEach Virtuoso partner category has an elected committee of network advisors that selects award nominees. Virtuoso travel advisors vote to decide the winners. This year’s Destination Showcase Award contenders received more than 4,500 votes in total.\n“This was a team effort,” said Dave Ferran, Senior Director of Sales at Classic Vacations. “Every department at Classic Vacations adds value to the Classic Difference that supports the Virtuoso Advisors, and provides both travelers and Travel Advisors with the best possible vacation experience.”\n“We carefully select world-leading land operators and destinations to join our exclusive portfolio based on the quality of the inspired experiences they provide to Virtuoso clients,” said Albert Herrera, senior vice president, Global Product Partnerships for Virtuoso. “To be recognized as the year’s most outstanding in such an exceptional group of partners is a rare distinction. Classic Vacations, with its focus on innovating to serve the needs of luxury travelers, is truly deserving of this year’s Best Custom Tour Partner award.”\nSource:- CLASSIC VACATIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:45:39.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
