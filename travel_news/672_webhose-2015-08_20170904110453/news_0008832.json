Running from September 29 until October 1, the event will feature keynote presentations and round-table discussions between international associations. Nancy Carfrae, coordinator of the UIA Associations Round Table, explained that the event aims to promote and facilitate the work of international associations by providing learning and networking opportunities. “Our sign of success is that association representatives leave the Round Table with ideas, information, and contacts that will help and inspire them in their association work,” she added. The event targets people working in and with associations, mainly international and regional ones but also national and local, and participants are expected to come from diverse associations. Carfrae added: “For the Round Table Asia-Pacific, we invite in particular associations based in the Asia-Pacific region, or those with members in the area.” Programme highlights include the opening keynote by Laura Lopez, a representative from the UN regional office, and case studies during the “Crisis and Victory” session. Participants can also join in interactive discussions and panel forums on other major topics. \"Governance and communication, which are topics of perennial interest and necessity to associations, will be featured this year,” Carfrae added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:59:37.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
