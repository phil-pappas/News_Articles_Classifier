He cleaned them with citric acid-based, food safe sanitizing wipes before handing them, in a Ziploc bag, to Kelly and Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui.\nThey saved a couple of leaves for Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka, who were outside the station doing a spacewalk.\n“They will eat half of the space bounty, setting aside the other half to be packaged and frozen on the station until it can be returned to Earth for scientific analysis,” NASA said on its website .\nA previous crop of lettuce was grown in space last year but was not eaten by astronauts. Instead, it underwent — and passed — food safety tests back on Earth.", "external_links": ["http://www.nasa.gov/feature/space-farming-yields-a-crop-of-benefits-for-earth"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:34:55.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
