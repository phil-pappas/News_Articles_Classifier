April and Jeff Cornell met when she was 18 and getting her first tattoo. Jeff, then working at Slave to the Needle, tattooed a giant gargoyle on her right arm. He was immediately smitten. But because the piece was so large, he had to do it in two sessions.\n“I had about a month between the first session and the second one. I wasn’t going to risk losing a client and having to finish the tattoo for free,” he joked.\nWhen the work was done, he asked her out and she said yes. Fifteen years later, they are married and run Hidden Hand Tattoo , a studio in Fremont. Though April only started tattooing after the shop opened in 2007, they are now both well-regarded — Jeff, for his “quasi-realistic, bright color stuff,” and April for her line work and black and gray shading. “Things that need to look perfect; that’s mostly what people come to me for,” she said.\nSeattle Tattoo Expo August 14-16, (2-10 p.m. Friday, noon-10 p.m. Saturday, noon-8 p.m. Sunday), Fisher Pavilion, Seattle Center, 305 Harrison St., Seattle; $20, three-day pass $50 (206-447-7725 or seattletattooexpo.com ).\nWhen the 14th annual Seattle Tattoo Expo comes to town Aug. 14-16 at the Fisher Pavilion in Seattle Center, Hidden Hand Tattoo will serve as the host shop to the three-day event featuring tattoo contests, performances from the all-female AC/DC cover band Hell’s Belles and burlesque troupe The Atomic Bombshells , as well as the opportunity to get tattooed by 150 tattoo artists, including New York’s Takashi Matsuba and Los Angeles’ Shawn Barber.\nMost Read Stories Black Lives Matter protesters shut down Bernie Sanders; later rally draws 15,000 60 years ago: The famous Boeing 707 prototype barrel roll over Lake Washington Seahawks' 53-man roster projection, post-scrimmage edition Seahawks rewarded for sticking to their salary-cap plan Condition of boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert improves “It’s always fun to host your friends in your own town and show them a good time,” said April. Added Jeff, “It’s a unique opportunity to showcase our city that we love very much in August — which is arguably the most beautiful month of year in Seattle.”\nWhen asked to name their favorite places, the duo — who are originally from Iowa and Utah — couldn’t stop naming favorite restaurants. Jeff admitted: “We have had to come to terms with the fact that we are, in fact, foodies.”\nHood? Fremont.\nFavorite tattoo artist, outside of your own shop?
