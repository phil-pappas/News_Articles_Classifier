On Saturday, the group Friends of Indiana Dunes will display historic photos, lead a \"history hike\" and celebrate the park's anniversary with a cake. The park was formally created on Aug. 29, 1925, with an initial purchase of just 110 acres on Lake Michigan's sandy southern shore. It has since grown to 2,182 acres and is visited by more than 1 million people each year. Preservationists initially envisioned the park to be a respite from commercial interests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T19:05:05.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
