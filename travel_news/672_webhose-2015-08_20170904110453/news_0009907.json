Australian travellers have been left without access to cash after a glitch with Commonwealth Bank travel money cards. Source: Supplied\nCustomer Vivienne Kelly, who was travelling in the UK, posted a complaint on the bank’s Facebook page and said she tried to get money out at the ATM but it was declined.\n“I’m in London and about to fly to Barcelona,’’ she wrote.\n“I tried to get money out at the ATM and it kept getting rejected, I know I have sufficient funds on the card.\n“To say I’m concerned about arriving in Barcelona with zero access to cash after midnight is an understatement.”\nShe said she accessed the bank’s online app only to be informed she had no currencies on her card despite having Australian dollars, euros and British Pounds uploaded.\nAnother distressed customer, Juliet Johns, said she was on her honeymoon and was “freaking out” after she was unable to access funds on her card.\n“Literally spent our last euros on dinner, tried three ATMs and nothing Venice, Italy,’’ she wrote.\nA Commonwealth Bank spokesman apologised online for the error and also issued a statement today.\n“Some of our Travel Money Card customers were unable to use the service early this morning due to a technical glitch which has now been resolved,’’ he said.\n“Commonwealth Bank apologises to our customers who were inconvenienced by this and we thank them for their patience.”\nIncrease ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437&title=Aussie+travellers+stranded+cashless", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437&h=Aussie+travellers+stranded+cashless", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Aussie+travellers+stranded+cashless&c=DISTRESSED+Australian+holiday-makers+around+the+world+have+been+left+stranded+without+cash+after+a+glitch+with+their+Commonwealth+Bank+travel+money+cards.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/distressed-australian-travellers-left-with-no-money-after-bank-glitch/story-e6frfq80-1227467733058?sv=ab7c6d9dac15b45a4379f964143a3437&title=Aussie+travellers+stranded+cashless"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T03:07:15.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
