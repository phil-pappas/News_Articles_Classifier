The awards ceremony which took place in Singapore on 12 August, recognized the profound character of Addie, who embodies the qualities of leadership by helping to positively shape the future of the region and nation of Thailand. \nOn receiving the award, Addie said, “I’d like to take this opportunity to say thank you to all my colleagues and work associates who have worked tirelessly to help me achieve this. It is a great honor and I am truly humbled by this award. As much as I appreciate the award, and as grateful as I am for it, the greatest reward I’ve ever been given is the opportunity to help and give back to my beloved country of Thailand.” \nAddie is a leading figure and highly respected representative of the tourism business in Thailand. Born and raised in Bangkok, Addie began her career in tourism as a guide immediately after graduating in 1974. It was a position that allowed her to do what she loved most – bring her beloved Thailand to the eyes of the world. Since then, positions held by Addie include working as a board member on the associations; Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and TCEB (Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau); and as Vice President at the Thailand Incentive and Convention Association (TICA), and Thailand Tourism Council. \nThe award recognized particular contributions by an individual who has made a difference to society, notably its people and the community, and how they have taken it upon themselves to lead as a responsible citizen. This ‘Special Category’ honor identified Addie’s volunteer work and her ongoing efforts to help those most in need. Devoting much of her time to corporate social responsibility (CSR), Addie has always seen it as a moral duty to ‘Give Back’, helping provide communities in which she lives and works with the necessary tools and services they need to improve their lives now and for generations ahead. Much of Addie’s work and her approach to CSR is documented in Destination Asia’s ‘Giving Back’ e-brochure.
