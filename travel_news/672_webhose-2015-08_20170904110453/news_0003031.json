All of the animals are either permanently injured or orphaned and not able to survive in the wild. Their zoo presence offers visitors the chance to see these creatures up close and learn about the importance of conserving their natural habitat. Included are a wide range of native mammals and birds, as well as a variety of reptiles, amphibians and fish.\nVisitors can also ride the animal-themed carousel at Bear Mountain State Park, only a short walk from the zoo. Located in an Adirondack-style pavilion, the carousel features specially carved animals, selected because they are indigenous to the area.\nThe Hudson Highlands Nature Museum’s Wildlife Education Center in Cornwall offers an indoor mini-zoo where a great horned owl, screech owls, mice, turtles, snakes, frogs and salamanders reside. The education center features interactive displays designed to keep young children busy. Demonstrations by museum educators introduce children to a new animal every weekend. The nature center is open Friday through Sunday from noon to 4 p.m., and currently features the special exhibit called “Marvelous Moths.”\nBellvale Farms in Warwick offers families the opportunity to learn howmilking a cow is handled. Tours, which include visiting the young calves, are offered by reservation at 12:30 p.m. on Sundays through October. Visitors often end the tour with a visit to the Bellvale Farm Creamery, just up the hill from the farm, for homemade ice cream and a view of the Warwick Valley.\n“There’s a whole menagerie here in Orange County,” Hawvermale added. “Come have a conversation with the many animals living in our area. The kids will have a blast.”\nBe sure to visit Orange County Tourism’s Facebook page: Orange County Tourism NY.
