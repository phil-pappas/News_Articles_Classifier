He asks: What do the recent airport expansion proposals mean for SMEs? Business writer Hazel Davis replies: The Airports Commission published its final report on 1 July, setting out its recommendations to Government for expanding aviation capacity in the UK. The analysis shows that expanded airport capacity is crucial for the UK’s long-term prosperity and the report concluded that Heathrow was the most viable candidate for a new north-west runway. Heathrow is the country’s largest airfreight hub and carries more freight (by value) than all the other UK airports combined. The report proposes a significant parcel of measures to address the community and environmental impacts and suggests that the expansion will provide more than 70,000 new jobs by 2050, add 40 more accessible destinations and generate up to £147bn in GDP impact over the next 60 years. The commission’s recommendations aim to ensure the expanded Heathrow collaborates better with local communities and businesses and delivers long-term economic benefits locally and nationally. It might be bad news for anyone nearby without double-glazing but it could be great news both for businesses based within reach of the airport and for the UK economy as a whole. Ali Golds is a start-up expert and CEO of Fuse, an online hub for people who want to start their own business. He adds: Anything that leads to more customers and more business opportunities can only be seen as a good thing, so you’d expect that a new runway at Heathrow to be a blessing. For those businesses already working in, or allied to, the airline industry, the promise of a new runway should be welcomed with open arms. There will be even more customers requiring your expertise (both UK-based and abroad); more opportunities for expansion both in your current markets and potential new ones; and perhaps the widening of the UK and wider business hub might see you make a move towards venturing into new horizons overseas. It will see more skilled workers heading to the Heathrow area and more apprenticeship opportunities being made available as a result, offering your SME the chance to up-skill as well as capitalise on the expertise of your current workforce. For those based in other industries, such as hotels and retailers, the opportunities are just as vast. More new businesses and staff flocking into the area will mean more customers for your business – and a chance to develop profits and expansion plans. Exporting will be easier, with new markets at home and abroad opening up due to the new trade routes that the runway will offer. But expansion also means more competition. Companies that may have not previously considered moving closer to the airport may well decide that this is the time for them to make the move. And those organisations based overseas, looking for new markets, may also take advantage and set up a UK base, competing directly with you. The need for skilled workers may also prove a problem, seeing a brain drain with other parts of the UK experiencing difficulty in recruiting due to workers now living in the London area, as was seen in the tech industry. This leads to higher wage costs and can hinder planned expansion. And for those businesses who rely on the outdoors, and who are based near Heathrow, the noise and emissions could see customers deciding to find other places less affected in which to spend their leisure time. None the less, competition is good. All companies face it every day and those who try to avoid it inevitably and eventually fail, so the airport expansion should not be used as an excuse but seen as an opportunity to improve and grow. Skill gaps and possible shortages should be addressed now, before work on the new runway begins, so that companies are prepared; perhaps opening dialogue with local education providers to discuss the long-term course and qualification provision in relation to workforce requirements. And business plans should be re-evaluated to include potential for export, with enquiries made to organisations such as UK Trade & Investment, to seek out new markets and chances for development. • Now expand your business fleet – contact the Volvo Car Business Centre on 0345 600 4027 or visit volvocars.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T20:54:54.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
