Monarch passengers have two options. The first option is one piece of hand luggage no bigger than 56 x 40 x 25cm, plus one small duty-free bag from the airport. The second option is two separate pieces of hand baggage, as long as the combined size is no bigger than 56 x 40 x 25cm (for example, a small duffel bag and a laptop bag) plus a small duty free bag from the departure airport. Weight : Whichever option passengers choose, the total weight of hand luggage must be no more than 5kg on charter flights and 10kg on scheduled flights. Can I book a hold bag on a single leg, and travel hand-luggage only on the other? Yes. A typical 20kg hold bag costs £21.99 per leg. Am I allowed any items in addition to my one cabin bag ? Whichever hand baggage option passengers choose, they may carry one small bag of duty-free goods from the airport in the cabin, in addition to their cabin baggage brought from home.
