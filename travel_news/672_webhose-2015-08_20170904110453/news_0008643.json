Georgia Aquarium rescued two male sea lions that are now in its care. SLIDESHOW of the sea lions' transport above. The sea lions are survivors of California's current \"unusual mortality event\" involving young sea lions. More than 3,000 starving sea lion pups have been founded stranded on California beaches this year. These two sea lions were rescued, rehabilitated and released multiple times before being deemed non-releaseable by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA Fisheries). In these cases, NOAA fisheries coordinates with zoos and aquariums to find homes for the lions. “It is an honor to not only help these sea lions and their rescuers on the ground, but to also provide a home to a few of the animals who were unable to be released and survive on their own. This is just one way we continue to be part of this effort,” Dennis Christen , senior director of zoological operations at Georgia Aquarium. One sea lion, a two-year-old male, was rescued three times at marine mammal centers in California. The other, which is one year old, was observed approaching people and taking food in California, and he was deemed a public safety risk. Both sea lions arrived from California last week. For their safety, they will remain in private areas of the aquarium until they acclimate to their new environment. \nGet Atlanta  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:04:45.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
