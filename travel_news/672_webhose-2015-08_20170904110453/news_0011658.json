Those hoping to conquer the summit can do so from December 1 when the new Mount Kinabalu Summit Trail opens. \n\nThe Mesilau Trail will be closed indefinitely until further notice as the mountain paths remain inaccessible since the quake. As such, all climbs will be using the Timpohon Trail exclusively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:24:30.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
