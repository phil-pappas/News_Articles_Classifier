No other family members became sick, and the child is recovering. \nPlague is carried by rodents such as squirrels and spread when fleas carry the disease from a dead rodent to other animals or people. \nOfficials say it is not transmitted between humans, except in the rare cases. Plague can be fatal if left untreated. \nSymptoms include fever, chills, nausea and swollen lymph nodes. \nSince 1970, 42 people in California have contracted plague resulting in nine deaths. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
