LaHood, who served as the United States Secretary of Transportation from 2009 until 2013, will advise on government policy and assist with OneJet's continued expansion into more regional travel markets throughout the U.S. \n\"It's a distinct honor to welcome Secretary LaHood to our team,\" says Matthew Maguire, OneJet Chief Executive Officer. \"Secretary LaHood's decades of experience on national transportation policy will be a critical resource as we work with stakeholders at all levels to efficiently expand access to the OneJet network.\" \nAs Secretary of Transportation, LaHood focused on efforts to improve safety and service levels in every mode of transportation, including aviation. He oversaw an agency with more than 55,000 employees and a US$70 billion budget in charge of air, maritime and surface transportation. \nSecretary LaHood stated: \"Through the use of mass scale distribution and smart capacity optimization, OneJet is innovatively leveraging our nation's existing air transportation capabilities to create new, highly accessible nonstop travel options for U.S. consumers and businesses. The opportunity to introduce such options to a growing network of communities is truly exciting and I plan to work diligently with the OneJet team to fulfill this mission.\" \nThe appointment of Secretary LaHood follows that of former Deputy Secretary of Transportation, John Porcari, who joined OneJet as a senior advisor earlier this year. Deputy Secretary Porcari stated: \"Today's appointment reflects the strength of commitment, from the highest levels of transportation leadership, to meaningfully improve service options for travelers in small and medium size air markets through the expansion of the OneJet program. I'm looking forward to working side by side with Secretary LaHood, as he and I have for many years, as we pursue the full scope of the opportunity at hand.\" \nOneJet recently announced a multi-phase expansion schedule, after conducting a successful pilot program earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:59:17.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
