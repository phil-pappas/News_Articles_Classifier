Preparations for this event are going well, and all is set to welcome another great fiesta on Praslin. \nThe event, now in its second year, was launched in 2015 with the aim of repositioning Praslin island as an ideal holiday destination. The Praslin Culinary & Arts Fiesta was launched after the people of the island voiced out the need to have an event on Praslin which will become an annual one on the country's calendar of events. \nMany tourists and Seychellois joined in the three-day fiesta last year, and the event was hailed as a success. This year, the event will once again bring forth the great talents of Praslin. A variety of activities are being organized during the weekend of September 4-6. The official poster and program of the fiesta have been revealed this week. \nSimilar to the previous year, hotels have come onboard to ensure the event is successful. On September 4, hotels on the island will be hosting Creole buffets and entertainment, while well-known artist Joseph Sinon and the Island Vibration band will play their top hits in the Bal Kreol at the Grand Anse community center. \nThe fiesta will be officially launched on September 5 by the Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St.Ange. This will be followed by the opening of an art exhibition aimed at showcasing the talents of the visual artists of Praslin. The two events will be held at Cote d'Or. Competitions are also on the program for next weekend. The island's non-professionals and professional chefs will have the chance to showcase their culinary talents and compete to win exciting prizes. The most creative kiosk and the one which will have the Creole touch to it will be rewarded. \nDJ Ezy D and his team will also be on Praslin to organize their Hype Beach party, which will be held at Cote d' Or on September 5. Other artists will also be there to perform some of their best hits. The Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation will once again be there for their road show, broadcasting live for the three days. Members of the public are being called on to come join in the celebrations on Praslin as the island shines during those three days. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
