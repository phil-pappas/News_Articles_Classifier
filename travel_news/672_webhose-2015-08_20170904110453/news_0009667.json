Gerard Julien/AFP \nMonths of speculation regarding the future of Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas ended with a bang on transfer deadline day Monday. With just hours remaining before the transfer window closed in Europe, Real Madrid finally came to an agreement with England’s Manchester United to bring home goalie David De Gea in exchange for Navas, according to the Spanish football news outlet Marca . \nReports from Spain said that Navas wanted to continue playing with Real Madrid, who he’s helped to a pair of shutouts to begin the season , as long as he’d be the top option in goal. However, president Florentino Pérez never concealed his desire to sign the 24-year-old De Gea, who was born in Madrid. \nDe Gea’s contract at Manchester United was slated to end next June and he would have been able to leave the club without penalty at the start of 2016. But buyout clauses have never deterred Real Madrid, the most lucrative club in the world, from getting a player they wanted. Following Navas’ spectacular play in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Los Merengues signed the Costa Rican after paying his former club Levante 10 million euros for his contract rights. \nThe Marca report says that Manchester United will pay between 12 million to 15 million euros to buy out Navas and his salary could double from the current rate of 3 million euros per year.

Van Gaal said Thursday that the Spaniard told him he didn’t want to play with the Reds any longer. \n“We had been observing him in preparation, he was not so good, he was not the same David de Gea as before,” Van Gaal said at a recent press conference. \nNavas will now fight for a starting position at Man U with Argentina’s Sergio Romero, who has started all six games in goal for the Reds. In Sunday’s loss to Swansea City, however, Romero received a downpour of criticism for letting a seemingly easy stop slip by into the goal to give Swansea the 2-1 win. Man U is currently 4-1-1 in the English Premier League. \nSpain’s soccer daily AS reported that Navas delayed his flight to Costa Rica in order to finalize his contract situation Monday. He was scheduled to join the Costa Rica men’s national team this week as they set out for the United States, where they will play a friendly in New Jersey against Brazil on Saturday. \nDespite keeping a clean sheet through two games and looking brilliant in preseason as Real Madrid’s new starter, the 28-year-old Costa Rican was always facing an uphill battle to establish himself in Madrid’s goal. Team president Pérez had been vocal about his hope to sign De Gea and replace the club’s greatest goalie of all-time, Iker Casillas, with another Spaniard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:50:19.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
