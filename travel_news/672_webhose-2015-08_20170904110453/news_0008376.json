He had reportedly been hurt breaking the glass to activate the train’s alarm.\nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve went to Arras in the wake of the incident, which occurred shortly after 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), his ministry said.\nHis spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet confirmed to AFP that a man had opened fire on the train.\n“We do not know the identity of this individual nor his motives,” said Brandet, adding: “It is too early to speak of a terrorist link.”\nThe SNCF spokesman had said earlier that three people were injured, two of them seriously, and that at least one suffered gunshot wounds.\n“The passengers are safe, the situation has been brought under control,” train operator Thalys said on Twitter.\nThalys said on its website that several trains had been delayed after the “intervention of security forces at Arras station.”\n“The train is at the station and emergency services are at the scene,” said Thalys, which is jointly owned by the national rail companies of Belgium, France and Germany.\nFrance remains on edge after Islamic extremists attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January, killing 17 people.\nIn June, a man beheaded his boss and tried to blow up a gas plant in southern France in what prosecutors say was an attack inspired by the Islamic State group.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/q5Qs7YXlm3", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tunisia?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MikeyKayNYC/status/634814897168216065", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/France?src=hash"], "published": "2015-08-22T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T09:31:35.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
