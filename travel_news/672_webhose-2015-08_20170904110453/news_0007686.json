PUBLISHED: 19:40, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:47, Thu, Aug 20, 2015 GETTY The Roman Coliseum is a well-loved tourist site \nSo important that they have become a corporate-level strategy says Roberta Jacoby, managing director of global tour operations. \n“We need to have tours that are not only great for the new-to-cruise group but also for seasoned travellers,” she says. \n“If you’re going to Rome for the very first time you want to see the Coliseum, Forum and Vatican, but if you’ve been to Rome a million times you are looking for something different. We look for the balance while evaluating tours.” \nNew tours are based on the increasingly popular travel trend for more localised, unique experiences. \n“The other thing we’ve noticed is that guests are looking at smaller groups with excellent content and guides,” says Jacoby. \n“There are tour guides, and then there are tour guides. Some guides will make a tour come alive and that is a really important aspect.” \nRoyal Caribbean International’s 24 ships visit around 270 ports all over the world.
