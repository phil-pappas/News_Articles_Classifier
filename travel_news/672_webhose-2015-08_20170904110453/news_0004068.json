But there is nothing Carl Fogarty likes more than heading out to explore the great British outdoors with his family in tow. With a childhood spent in motorhomes as he followed his motorcycle-racing father to the Isle of Man and Silverstone in his school holidays, Fogarty feels quite at home on the open road. In fact, the 2014 winner of I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! says his career on the racing circuit, which involved sleeping in motorhomes across Europe, were some of his fondest memories. So it comes as no surprise that the star is fronting the Freedom To Go campaign with the National Caravan Council, encouraging British holidaymakers to enjoy an active lifestyle in the great outdoors. Explaining why the campaign is so important to him, Fogarty says: “I just love being outdoors and the whole camping thing. And that's any form of camping – glamping, log cabins and all that kind of thing. “In the jungle, it really brought back how much I miss that and how much I enjoy being around nature.” We even made a cot out of the bath, which was Danielle’s bed for two years As much as the reality-show winner enjoyed sleeping out in Australia, he truly loves exploring the countryside on his own doorstep. “We’ve got great things to do here and a great coastline,” he says. “For the past 40 years I have had a place in Anglesey, which I sold a year ago. I loved it over there but wanted to move around a bit more and go to different places in the UK.” The most successful World Superbike racer of all time, Fogarty says he is spoilt for choice when it comes to travelling around his home country. “I feel like I want to travel down south a bit more. I’ve done the Lakes a lot and places such as Whitby, but I’d quite like to go to Cornwall. The beaches down there are pretty nice. I’m planning a trip in September and trying to organise a motorhome to stay in.” A true fan of Britain’s varied coastline, the Blackburn-born star spends his holidays indulging in simple pleasures, from walking his dogs on the beach to mountain biking. “I do really love the sea,” he explains. “I love driving over to Anglesey, especially when you take the A55 in North Wales and look out over the beautiful views. I also enjoy being on the water, taking a boat out, jet-skiing and fishing.” Pan-tastic: Carl is planning to travel in a motorhome to Cornwall in September His wife Michaela and two daughters, Danielle and Claudia, are also fans of family holidays on the road. “My kids were very young when I was racing and they would travel everywhere with us. We even made a cot out of the bath, which was Danielle’s bed for two years,” he says with a laugh. Branching out earlier this year, the family tried out a sleek Airstream for the first time. “That is one quality piece of kit,” Fogarty enthuses. “It was great, although I’m more of a motorhome person. I’ve always had a motorhome with a little motorbike on the back so I can pop out and buy a loaf of bread and pint of milk.” But does he have any words of wisdom for a driver who may be a bit more nervous about taking to the road in a large vehicle? “I’ve done it so many times before it doesn’t fill me with dread, it’s not a problem for me. “But if you’re unsure, go somewhere for a few days first that you’ve been to before in the car. At least you’ve got an idea about what to expect before setting off on a longer adventure,” he says.
