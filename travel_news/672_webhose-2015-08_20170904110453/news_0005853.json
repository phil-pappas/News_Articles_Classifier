The six-person tent, he argued, could be erected by a lake and — ta-da! — become a beach house. \nOnce I came around to accepting our movable house as a kind of blessing, I set out to christen it near the most amazing lake I could find. \nAce Adventure Resort in Minden, W.Va., fit the bill, boasting a 5-acre lake turned water park with inflatable jungle gyms, a giant slide and a zip line that ends with a splash. \nWe’d frolic in a souped-up swimming hole. We’d visit the kitschiest wonders of the world. We’d explore the wildest mountains and gape at the New River Gorge Bridge, a feat of engineering that saves folks from driving all the way down a mountain only to go back up again. Did I mention the bridge is taller than the Washington Monument with two Statues of Liberty stacked on top? \nWe arrived at the resort well after nightfall and found our way to the Lost Paddle lounge, where Bob Marley was playing through the speakers and a few young folks were shooting pool. We relaxed with a few beers before making our way to our campsite. By the glow of the bathhouse and our car headlights, we pitched our “lake house” and settled in for the night. \nThe quiet hours are midnight to 8 a.m., which is considerably liberal by campground standards. Neighbors pushed that curfew, singing off-key renditions of I Wanna Dance With Somebody late into the night. \nThe sun came up shortly after our neighbors went to sleep, and we finally had our first look at the lake. A 15-foot-tall iceberg climbing wall lorded over the other inflatables, including jungle gyms, trampolines and wobbly-looking Saturns. But the big three — a 40-foot-tall water slide, a zip line and a blob trampoline — were the ones I was eyeing. After donning my mandatory personal flotation device, I chose to enter the water via the slide. \nWhat followed was several hours of what I imagine the ideal childhood summer is like. I climbed to the top of the iceberg, bounced on the trampolines and glided down the zip line. The water was the perfect temperature of cool, and the air the perfect temperature of warm. \nWhile there were plenty of splashing families in the water, more than once I took a minute to just float calmly and appreciate the steep mountains that surround the lake and the blue sky spotted with cotton-candy clouds. \nGetting out was a struggle, but I wanted to visit the New River Gorge Bridge that is minutes from the resort. \nThe bridge towers 876 feet above the New River, a playground for white-water enthusiasts. Besides being pretty to look at, the bridge has a catwalk under it that visitors can strap onto for a walking tour and, for the more adventurous, B.A.S.E. jumping (it stands for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth) once a year. We chose to view the mammoth structure from the safety of the overlook near the Canyon Rim Visitor Center. \nThe art of wanderlust was passed down to me from my dad. By his definition, it means driving around aimlessly and, when you see something worth stopping at, making it your “destination.” We had picked up two brochures at the campground and, with a vague understanding of where we were going, headed to see what is claimed to be West Virginia’s only working lighthouse. \nErected in 2012, the white tower does sit near a body of water (Summersville Lake) and is an aid to navigation (planes, not boats). Mostly I saw it as something built to get $7 from tourists. Still, I gave up my cash willingly to have a guide lead me up the 122 steps to the top and tell me a little more about the landmark. \nBut it wasn’t the gimmick I had expected. The busted windmill was repurposed, students from the nearby Fayette Institute of Technology built the spiral staircase inside and a nearby airport donated a vintage Fresnel lens. It was more a story of a small town coming together to build something iconic. From the top, I could appreciate the vision. \nOur next brochure-inspired stop was the Mystery Hole. If UNESCO World Heritage sites honored kitschiness, the Mystery Hole would be a top destination. The brochure lured us in with all the skill of a carnival barker: “UNBELIEVABLE — an experience that will intrigue you the rest of your life.” \nThe building that houses the spot where “the laws of nature are defied” features a gorilla on the roof, a vintage Volkswagen Bug crashed into the side and an eerie-looking clown over the entrance. It was enough to hook me as well as about a dozen or so other people who lined up for one of the 15-minute tours. \nInside, as the brochure promised, we felt our balance upset. The “hole” is really a room under the building that seemed tilted at a 45-degree angle, but some of the tricks (if that’s what they were) were still difficult to explain. I tried not to overthink it: Just enjoy the feeling of vertigo. \nThe next morning, we headed for another brochure-driven outing, to the Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine. As the great-great-granddaughter of a coal miner, I was eager to see the museum dedicated to the men who have done this dirty job. The tour includes a ride through a now-closed mine. Even though the ceiling has been raised from what the miners would have worked in and lighting has been added throughout, the cool, damp and dark passage felt claustrophobic as the train carrying me and 35 or so other visitors trundled along. \nTwo guides shared tales of what life was like miles underground. From the funny (putting Grandma’s false teeth in your water pail to ward off thirsty thieves) to the cringe-worthy (rats were harbingers; if they started running, miners followed and tried to get out fast), they gave a comprehensive look at life in the mines. \nAlso among the brochures I had collected was a cave that claimed to have been the home of Bat Boy. If you didn’t go to a grocery store in 1992, you might have missed Bat Boy’s coverage in the now online-only black-and-white tabloid the Weekly World News . The story: The government had found and captured a boy who was raised by bats and had taken on odd features, including oversize pointy ears, razor-sharp teeth and ghoulishly big eyes. The tabloid followed his escape, exploits and eventual military service; a younger me believed every bit of it, and was terrified. \nI decided to face my fear of the creature by visiting his turf, Lost World Caverns in Lewisburg. Flashlights in hand, my husband and I headed down a tunnel for a self-guided tour around what turned out to be the home of magnificent stalactites, stalagmites and other intricate formations. \nUpon exiting, I understood why Bat Boy would want to call West Virginia home. It is a very wild, very wonderful and very, very weird place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:20:15.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
