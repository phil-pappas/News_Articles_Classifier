Within an easy hour's drive, we wonder why we don't cruise away more often. \nWe have delayed leaving Christchurch until 9am, allowing time for ice on the roads to clear. I'm drawn to the mountains, but today they are also giving me anxiety pangs. We are heading to Porters for half a day of skiing. I haven't skied for 18 years, while Neill is a gun from years of skiing in Austria. On the skifield, we are poles apart, which is probably why we don't go often. During our last visit to Porters, two decades ago, Neill bombed down Big Mama (an extreme 1.2km run), while I gaped from the base of the mountain. \nHumming along the alpine highway today, Neill is busy reliving great runs at ski resorts such as Obergurgl and Kitzbuhel, while I'm thinking plaster of Paris and broken legs. \nWe reach the turn-off to Porters by mid-morning. The twisty gravel access road is well graded and there is room to pass if drivers are patient and hold their breaths. \nOn this Saturday, more than 1000 skiers and snowboarders have flocked to the slopes. Porters has anticipated the white flight from the city and arranged guides to help visitors park on the precipitous edge of the road. \nPorters has a new four-seater chair-lift for skiers and snow boarders. \nCouples, togged up for snowboarding, young families and backpackers are all making a pilgrimage to the mountain. Officious keas patrol the car park, in search of dropped lunches. Ad Feedback \nThe sky is cornflower blue and cloudless. The skifield at the southern end of the Craigieburn Range is shaded by mountains, but it's not the wind chilling my bones. Neill is poised with his skis, crash helmet and snow goggles at the ready. He can barely wait for my hire skis (wider and shorter than they used to be) and boots to be fitted. \nWhen I casually mention there's no need to linger on the learners' slope with me, he scarpers like a husky let off its chain. But first, he kindly hands me his helmet, so I don't crack my nut, and makes a vague promise to meet for lunch. \nOn the magic carpet, which crawls along at a glacial pace, I'm surrounded by tots who look too young to walk, let alone ski (There's no shame, I tell myself). Besides, the views of Big Mama and the Bluff face are outstanding and up there, somewhere, Neill is in his element. \nHaving nailed the carpet, and completed a few test runs, I head to the platter lift on the next level. On this longer and wider run, I practise slow turns and braking with my trusty snow-plough manoeuvre. \nBy the time Neill joins me and suggests trying out the new four-seater chair-lift, I'm ready to conquer more of the mountain. I haven't fallen yet, and if I freak out, I can always stay on the chair-lift and take the lonely ride of shame down the mountain. \nSoaring to giddy heights with Neill and another, I'm struck by the views and the quietness at this altitude, but, all too soon, the ride comes to an end. The guys expertly negotiate the ski-ramp exit. However, after hesitating, I'm still on the chair-lift when it starts rising again. Neill yells \"jump\" and gives me a helpful shove from the ground. I leap freestyle from a metre or so up, but splatter on to ice. Lying on my stomach, I commando-crawl out of the way to avoid causing a pile-up of skiers. \nThis is not a confidence booster and I realise I'm far above my comfort level. Had it been deep, cushioning powder snow, I could have fluked a descent, but the sound of skis grating on cruddy ice unnerves me. The steep pitch is also putting me off and my skis are taking flights of fancy. \nOn attempting basic turns, I bite the ice again and again. \nOn the fourth fall, I'm cast on my back like a high-country ewe, with my lower legs at acute angles to the rest of my legs and I'm wondering if they're broken. It takes multiple attempts to detangle myself and stand up, without sliding uncontrollably. With dented pride, I nurse my way down the rest of the slope. \nUnwilling to end our rare ski sojourn on a bum note, I return to the platter lift for a few good runs, reclaiming the day. I'm still glad I tried the chair-lift and nearby slope, but am horrified to later learn its name â€“ \"Easy Street\". \nPromising to return and beat Easy Street one day, we leave Porters and head west on State Highway 73. Castle Hill is looking ethereal in the pink afternoon light and we tick off ski areas Cheeseman, Broken River and Craigieburn Valley, before arriving at our night's destination. \nAt 700m elevation, Grasmere Lodge is one of the highest and longest-inhabited buildings in the high country. The original cob-and-slab hut from 1858 is contained within a gracious, larger homestead. We're warmly welcomed by a staff member, Heaven-Leigh Karanga, with high-country hospitality of tea and shortbread. \nShe shows us the menu for tonight's four-course meal. No choices are offered, so the chef wants to be sure there is nothing we don't like. We wander the snowy grounds with Heaven-Leigh, visiting an impressive wine cellar and two small lakes that have frozen over. At the nearby stables, two horses and their riders have just returned from a long trek. \nGuests at Grasmere Lodge can ride a horse or take an alpine hike. \nGrasmere has a new lodge with multiple rooms and relaxing communal lounges, but we're staying in the owner's cottage, which is tucked into the hills behind the homestead. \nWe settle into our gorgeous abode and find it has a resident pet, a sheep called Marcus, who acts more like a dog and even tries to follow us inside. We decide to walk one of the farm tracks up a slope known as Broom Hill. The permafrost crunches underfoot and we negotiate trees that have fallen in a recent snowstorm. At a lookout, we admire the view of the farm and Lake Grasmere, then head back the same way. The spa bath and a beer are calling, and a chance to relax before dinner. \nDark falls early and decisively. On the 10-minute walk from the cottage to the lodge, the Milky Way stops us in our tracks. We haven't seen the night sky this clear and unpolluted for years and the quiet hurts our ears. What initially looked like beacons on the summit of a mountain, turn out to be Jupiter and Venus so spectacularly bright and close, they are almost kissing. \nIn the Grasmere bar, with an Amisfield pinot noir in hand, we learn more about the lodge. Up to 70 per cent of visitors are from the United States, who come to fish for trout, hunt, hike and enjoy the serenity and sense of space. Winter is a good time to visit when the weather is settled, days are crisp and snow casts a heavenly glow. \nAfter tasty canapes, we are escorted to a private dining room with a candlelit table set for two, beside a roaring fire. Busy in the kitchen is chef Jean-Michel Poulot, formerly of Saggio di vino in Victoria St and Edesia in Addington. \nA keen fly-fisher, Jean-Michel would drive from Christchurch to prime South Island lakes and rivers most weekends. When Edesia closed last year, he packed up and moved to Grasmere Lodge, to be nearer to fishing grounds. Now, he can squeeze in a fishing trip at 4.30am before cooking breakfast for guests. \nSeated, with another pinot noir, we break the Grasmere milk bread topped with sesame seeds. Although we don't want to fill up on bread, the rolls are fairy soft, fluffy and irresistible. \nThe handmade ravioli of blue cheese, ricotta and spinach is rich, creamy and Edesia-style. We're glad we were pre-warned about the egg that erupts from deep within the pasta parcel. \nA green mango and feijoa vodka sorbet cuts through the creaminess and delivers an alcoholic punch. We're not driving tonight, so there's no need for moderation. \nNeill's confit of Canterbury duck leg with kumara puree, baked yam and baby carrots is a work of art, and has layer upon layer of flavour. My pumpkin gnocchi with caramelised squash and celeriac (one of Jean-Michel's favourite ingredients) puree is exquisite. \nFull as we are, we can't turn down a chocolate dish that turns out to be the piece de resistance. When pierced with a spoon, lava-like Valrhona chocolate flows from a fondant pudding. It is paired with salted caramel icecream sitting on a bed of crystalised chocolate \"rocks\" and topped with a dark chocolate quill. It is a five-star dining experience that you would expect in a city, but seems more remarkable in this mountain setting, where Jean-Michel cooks breakfast, lunch and tea. \nBefore cooking our meal, he has already made a round of gourmet burgers for the other guests staying at Grasmere on this night â€“ a New Zealand family who chose to dine in their cottage and enjoy the rugby by the fireside. \nGrasmere, the high-country station, is a mecca for outdoor adventurers. Photo: Julian Apse \nFor us, it is novel to step from the lodge's dining room into pitch blackness and use the flashlight on the mobile phone to find our way back to our accommodation, where Marcus the dog sheep awaits. \nWe're zonked from mountain air, good food, wine and company and sleep comes easily. We wake to a fresh dusting of snow, sweeping rural views and a Jean-Michel breakfast delivered to the cottage. \nMy scrambled eggs on toast are light and frothy, and Neill devours his musterer's breakfast of bacon, eggs, sausages, mushrooms and hash brown. \nWe are farewelled in true high-country style, with a plate of croissants and pain au chocolate for the journey home. To celebrate a special occasion, the down-to-earth luxury at Grasmere Lodge is hard to beat. \nWe vow to return for a significant birthday, an anniversary or a milestone such as conquering Easy Street. \nSoon, we are cruising the long straights of the highway home, past black lakes and ghostly Narnia-style limestone rock formations conjuring up a little bit of magic on our back doorstep. \nYvonne was hosted by Grasmere Lodge and Porters. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:11:43.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
