I have followed all the required steps to get this matter resolved. There still is no resolution or answer to my original request. \nOur son left this world with debts that need to be settled. While $349 may seem like a small amount of money, it puts us farther down the road to paying off real obligations. All other businesses I have contacted have responded with cooperation and kindness. Only Allegiant has met my request for assistance with barriers to receiving a reasonable and just resolution. Can you help me? \nâ€” William Osborne, Davenport, Fla. \nA: I'm so sorry about your loss. When a passenger dies, the industry-standard policy is to refund a ticket to the next of kin or to that person's estate. \nBut a closer look at Allegiant's terms and conditions suggests that it might not follow that standard. The airline doesn't address the death of a passenger, but it takes a hard line on passengers who have a death in the family, saying that you can get a refund only if it's within 24 hours of purchase (that's a federal law) but otherwise are stuck with your ticket. \nThat's an exceptionally coldhearted policy. And while it may be true that this policy can \"keep our fares low for all passengers\" and allows Allegiant to \"stay competitive,\" it also sticks passengers with a bill for a ticket they'll never use and unjustly enriches Allegiant's investors. That makes my blood boil. \nYou could have reached out to one of Allegiant's executives; I publish their names and email addresses on my site (elliott.org/company-contacts/allegiant). Amazingly, it appears that Allegiant was willing to waive its \"no refunds\" policy in your case. Adding the penalty fees to the point where you were getting only $49 back was incredibly insensitive, however. I contacted the airline on your behalf. Allegiant says that it was waiting for you to send an obituary for your son and that it intended to send you a full refund all along. \nYou received every penny of the $349 back. \nChristopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine and a co-founder of the Consumer Travel Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for travelers.
