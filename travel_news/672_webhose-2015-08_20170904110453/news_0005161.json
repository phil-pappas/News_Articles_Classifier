The achievement is on the back of a record 2014 performance, when the number of events jumped 11% from the 2013 record of 1,565 to 1,759. \nOn the calendar for the remainder of the year, General Manager Alan Pryor says are “over 25 events with an expected total turnout in excess of 420,000 people. And this does not include banquets and entertainment activities or events held at TenOnCall which services the short-lead or just-in-time corporate meetings sector. “After a decade of operation, it is fitting that in our 10th anniversary year, we have hosted many prestigious government-related events and we are honoured to be have been selected the venue of choice for many ASEAN ministerial meetings.” In addition, Pryor says, “we are fortunate to have a loyal client base such as BookFest, HOMEDEC, PIKOM PC Fair, ARCHIDEX, Star Education Fair and Asia Oil & Gas Conference who have all made consecutive appearances and/or hosted every (event) edition with us since our opening in June 2005.” That said, “a knowledgeable and professional team committed to meeting and satisfying clients’ evolving meetings needs by consistently delivering flexible, innovative and value-add solutions across the board has also been integral to our success and a key point of difference.” Moving forward, to reward loyal repeat clients and entice new regulars, the Centre has extended the 2014 prices for her popular Day Conference Packages (DCPs) With a Difference, PlenaryOnCall, PlenaryHallOnCall and Banquets & Functions menus through to the end of the first quarter next year (2016). “Coupled with what’s happening around the venue, we are confident of finishing (the year) on a strong note and into the next year,” adds Pryor. This offer is in addition to the Centre’s latest value-add for DCPs; which already include coffee break(s), lunch, ‘Snack on Arrival’, unrivalled IT and A/V support, free Wi-Fi and much more for half and full-day packages, where between now and 31 December 2015, Convention and Conference clients who confirm their bookings for three or more consecutive years will enjoy the previous year’s all-inclusive DCPs rates as well as a ‘special rebate’ of 10% to 25% on venue hire, depending on event size. There is also a new À La Carte & Venue Hire Package which gives clients a selection of coffee breaks and lunch options costed on a person basis. Here too, confirmed bookings made for three or more consecutive years will benefit from the previous year’s rates and a 3% to 9% ‘special rebate’ on venue hire.
