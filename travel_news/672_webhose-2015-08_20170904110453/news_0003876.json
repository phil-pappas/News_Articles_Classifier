Holidays are all about enjoying yourself, so I’m absolutely not going to advocate a diet of kale and green juice while you’re away. But there are a couple of things you can do to help you come back feeling just as healthy as when you left. I always pack a handful of healthy things – a travel blender, a couple of packets of rye bread and lots of snacks. I know the travel blender probably sounds totally mad, but it’s a simple way to ensure that you’re getting enough goodness while you’re away. When I arrive, I buy some oats, spinach, bananas and a selection of other fruit (berries, mango, pineapple etc) to blend for easy breakfasts. This way you don’t need to stress about getting enough fruit and veg into your diet throughout the rest of your day, so you’ll enjoy all your other meals fully. I bring rye bread so that I know I can always toast it to eat with mashed banana, honey, avocado or whatever else I want for breakfast. Rye bread is full of goodness – it’s wheat-free, not gluten-free, but it’s much healthier than almost all gluten-free breads as it’s very natural and almost never contains added sugars or stabilisers. There’s nothing worse than being hungry on holiday – it really takes away from your enjoyment of the trip. So when you’re peckish (but feel you’ve been overdoing the ice cream), I’d recommend a portable, protein-rich snack such as nuts or seeds. Oat cookies, home-made granola bars and energy bites are all awesome options too –they can all be made in advance and taken with you to enjoy while you’re away. 'Exercise beats jet-lag and is great for your digestion – especially helpful if you’re sampling lots of the local cuisine!' Making a meal for the plane can help you feel fresh and energised when you land. Sadly you won’t get hummus or almond butter through airport security, but I normally make something like a quinoa or brown rice salad with roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, seeds, some greens, lots of lime and olive oil. I board the plane laden with snacks and make sure to drink plenty of water on the flight. I know it’s boring, but try not to drink alcohol on the plane as it will leave you so dehydrated, which won’t help your body adjust when you arrive – especially if it’s a long-haul flight with a big time change. The only other thing I do when I’m away to ensure I still feel great is try to get some daily movement, whether that’s a walk, a swim, some yoga, a run on the beach or a local gym class. It’s a great way to explore the area and a little gentle exercise is such a good mood and energy booster. It beats jet-lag too; a bit of exercise before and after a long flight helps me sleep properly when I arrive, setting me up for a much more enjoyable trip. Plus, being active is great for your digestion – especially helpful if you’re sampling lots of the local cuisine! Finally, look up cool local juice bars or interesting local health spots before you go so that you can try some new places that will make you feel great. Happy holidays.
