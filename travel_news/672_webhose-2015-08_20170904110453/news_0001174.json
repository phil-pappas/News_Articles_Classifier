And it threatens several other native fish species, including the longfin smelt, green sturgeon and winter-run Chinook salmon.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, a Delta smelt is seen at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab in Byron,Calif. The tiny, endangered fish, found in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is at the the center of the state's water battle between farmers and biologists. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) In July, a key index of delta smelt abundance hit zero for the first time since the survey began in 1959. Researchers found a handful of smelt, but the number was too small to register on the population gauge.\n\"The delta smelt is basically on its last legs right now. We'll be lucky if it survives the coming year,\" said Peter Moyle, a fish biologist at the University of California, Davis who has been studying the fish for four decades.\nOn a recent fish survey, Moyle and three other researchers trawled the turbid waters of the sprawling estuary that once teemed with the delta smelt.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, eggs from a female Delta smelt are removed to be fertilized during a demonstration conducted by Luke Ellison, research supervisor at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab in Byron, Calif.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) They pulled a net out of the water and emptied dozens of fish into a plastic bin on their research boat. They logged and tossed back 13 species, including carp, crappie, catfish and striped bass — but no delta smelt.\nDelta smelt populations have been declining for decades due to invasive predators, pollution, habitat loss and increased water exports to farms and cities. The drought has worsened conditions by reducing freshwater flows and raising water temperatures.\n\"The drought has basically made all the things that were bad for smelt worse,\" Moyle said.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, eggs from a female delta smelt are removed to be fertilized during a demonstration conducted by Luke Ellison, research supervisor at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab in Byron, Calif.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) The delta smelt has been at the center of vicious water fights between farmers, fishermen, cities and environmentalists ever since it was listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1993. It was listed as an endangered under state law in 2010.\nThe government regularly cuts water exports from the delta to protect the smelt and other threatened fish from being sucked into the giant pumps that send water south.\nScientists and environmentalists say the sensitive fish needs protection because it's a key indicator of the delta's health, but farmers say too much precious water has been wasted on the fish — water that could be used to grow crops and fill reservoirs.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, Luke Ellison, research supervisor at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab, gets a tag to be placed in delta smelt for future study of the fish at the lab in Byron,Calif.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) Stanislaus County almond grower Jim Jasper, who relies on delta water to irrigate his orchards, was a part of a lawsuit that challenged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over delta smelt protections. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected their appeal earlier this year, leaving the water restrictions in place.\nLast year, Jasper pulled out 400 acres of almond trees — about one-fifth of his orchards — because he couldn't get enough water to irrigate them, reducing his almond production and forcing him to cut employee work hours.\nStanding next to the irrigation canal that delivers water from the delta, Jasper said endangered species protections have worsened the agricultural impacts of the drought.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, Luke Ellison, research supervisor at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab, demonstrates how a tag is placed in a delta smelt for future study at the lab in Byron, Calif.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) \"The delta smelt continues to wrack a lot of havoc on today's farming community,\" said Jasper, who runs Steward & Jasper Orchards, the Newman, California-based almond company his father co-founded in 1948. \"If it became extinct would anybody's lives change? I really don't think so.\"\nThe UC Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Laboratory in Byron may be the last place where you can still find large numbers of delta smelt.\nThe hatchery was recently awarded a $10 million federal grant to continue its work breeding the smelt in captivity for scientific research and to ensure its survival if the species vanishes from the wild.\nIn this Wednesday, July 15, 2015 photo, Luke Ellison, research supervisor at the University of California Davis Fish Conservation and Culture Lab, displays a Delta smelt that he has just placed an orange identification tag on for future study at the lab in Byron,Calif.

Due to California's epic drought, Central Valley farmers who depend on water pumped from the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta to irrigate their crops, have seen their water allocations reduced or eliminated altogether. Much of the blame for the cuts to water supplies is the state's efforts to supply water for the endangered Delta smelt.
