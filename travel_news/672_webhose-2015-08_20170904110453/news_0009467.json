TAT advises tourists who are currently staying in the city to avoid the area this evening. \n“TAT has not yet received confirmed reports of the number or nationality of casualties but there are no British or Irish nationals thought to be affected. \n“All transport links in central Bangkok are running as usual but while the intersection is investigated there may be disruption to traffic. Hotels and shopping malls in the surrounding area will be open as normal from tomorrow. All other tourist attractions and services are open and operating as usual.” \n“TAT advises tourists to remain vigilant whilst travelling through busy parts of the city and if they see anything suspicious to report it to a nearby police or security officer.
