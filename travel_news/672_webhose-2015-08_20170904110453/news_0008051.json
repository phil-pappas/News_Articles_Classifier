After an overwhelmingly positive response during the pilot which resulted in over 10,000 live chat requests, AmTrav decided to release this feature broadly, so that all of its customers can benefit from this convenient, industry-leading feature.\nClients and prospects can initiate a live chat with AmTrav agents from any page on the AmTrav website, and can also access chat from any smartphone or tablet. Customers will experience the same quality service they are accustomed to at AmTrav through the chat option. The same agents that assist with phone inquiries are the same agents who will answer chat requests. Those agents are in-house, highly experienced, and available 24/7.\n\"In line with our mission to offer services that make business travel easy, AmTrav is providing in-house 24/7 support by live chat now in addition to existing in-house, 24/7 phone support.
