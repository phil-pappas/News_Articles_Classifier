THE-ICE is an international accreditation body of hospitality and tourism courses based in Australia.\nFor its part, Malaysia has taken the initiative to develop an ASEAN-focused TV travel channel – GOASEAN – to promote ASEAN as a single tourism destination.\nIt features key areas such as nature-based tourism, culture and heritage tourism, family fun and business tourism.\nTo support the growth of ASEAN tourism, Pradeep pointed out that tourism research and sharing of expertise in the region was essential.\nIn this connection, he said, the ASEAN Tourism Research Association, of which he is president since 2013, could well serve as a one-stop centre for tourism research and education.\nThe 18th Meeting of ASEAN Tourism Ministers in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar last January noted that preliminary figures showed that 97.2 million international tourists visited ASEAN member countries in 2014, up three per cent from 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:17:17.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
