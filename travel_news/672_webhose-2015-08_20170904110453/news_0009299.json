Some tips: » Travel during off-peak times. Two of the slowest periods for air travel are Dec. 1 to 14 and then Jan. 4 to Feb. 15.\n» Fly on slow days. Planes tend to have the most empty seats on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.\n» Do a flexible date search. Sites like ITA Software and Cheapair.com let travelers pull up a calendar with the cheapest days to fly between two airports.\n» Consider nearby airports. Driving an extra 50 miles might save $100 per person.\n» Look for routes flown by Frontier, Southwest and Spirit. Other airlines are matching or beating their fares.\n» Take advantage of the 24-hour rule. Passengers have 24 hours after buying a ticket to get a full refund. The day after booking a flight, check back to see whether fares have fallen. Cancel and rebook at the lower price.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T00:25:09.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
