By Jane Woolridge Miami Herald \nThe white-gloved waiter brings the freshly squeezed juice to our banquette framed by white drapes. Soon, a canopied boat will ferry us from the gardens of the 17th century garden palace across the city’s centerpiece lake to the fabled palace of the Maharana of the House of Mewar. \nWe’re in the India of a glorious past, of jeweled palaces and geometric gardens, tiger preserves and the exquisite white marble mausoleum that marks a timelessly obsessive romance. For two weeks we’ll be chauffeured through fabled Rajasthan on a private tour in a gleaming white Ambassador, the iconic conveyance of India post-Raj. \nThe tab: less than $2,000 for bed-and-breakfast, car and driver. And yes, that’s for two. If you go India tours \nNamaste India Tours offers a car-and-driver who doubles as a general helpmate with two levels of hotels The company focuses on Rajasthan and city tours of Delhi. namasteindiatours.com \nMany companies offer organized tours for a relatively reasonable price. Several companies now offer river cruises on the easternmost parts of the Ganges, including Vantage ( vantagetravel.com ), Uniworld ( uniworld.com ) and Pandaw ( pandaw.com ). \nWith other meals, guides, museums, tips and the doctor — we’ll get to that — our vacation comes to less than $100 per person per day, plus airfare and shopping. Most Read Stories Why did the Mariners’ season go terribly wrong? \nNo, we didn’t languish in the five-star private enclaves that grace sleek magazine covers — though we did stay in several royal-owned boutique hotels that made us feel like pampered guests of a bygone time. And while our meals weren’t prepared by the stars of the “MasterChef India” TV series, we ate well enough on dal, chicken korma and occasionally pasta. \nWhat a change from my last trip to India, some 20 years ago. Then, little was computerized, phones rarely worked and traveling anywhere entailed endless forms and even longer queues. Today any English-speaker can easily catch the Metro from the airport to New Delhi and book trains ts to tiger safaris online. \nBut my husband has declared that he’s past his do-it-yourself-in-the-developing-world days. But we’re also not in for a group tour. And why should we deal with the hassles of luggage and public transportation when Namaste India Tours — a small family-run company highly recommended by a friend — can take care of the details for such a reasonable price? \nThe website was enough to convince us, telling us: \nLearn this phrase early in your trip: “Ye hai India, darling.” (Pronounced yea hay India, darling.) This is your mantra whenever something goes wrong, when things don’t move fast enough for you, when the road is blocked by a cow, when you haggle ferociously for 15 minutes to reach an agreement on the price of a bracelet and as you proudly leave with your purchase the shopkeeper throws in a second one for free, when a 6-year-old street beggar tugs on your elbow and offers you a handful of berries, when the lights go out as the sun comes up, when the lights go out as the sun goes down … “This is India, darling.” \nAt least, we knew, we’d be dealing with people with a sense of humor and a firm grip on the realities of frustration. \nWe opted for a trip to Rajasthan’s highlights in “legacy” lodgings — an upgrade from the lesser priced clean-but-basic offerings — with an itinerary tailored to meet our interests and time frame. We were welcome to choose our own lodgings or mix-and-match with those offered by Namaste. A handful of emails with Jawahar, Namaste’s owner, and our plan was set. Since Jawahar takes no credit cards, we’d pay on arrival. The Ambassador \nTrue to promise, Namaste’s white-clad driver, Mr. Hukam, picked us up at the Delhi airport at the appointed hour. He became our guardian, ferrying us from city to city, arranging guides on request, directing us to tourist-savvy shops, advising us on appropriate prices, pointing out the best camel ride operator. For the first few days we struggled to understand the unfamiliar cadence and accent of his voice, but we soon understood each other well enough. And no one could have taken better care of us. \nThe man was an ace behind the wheel, which is no small feat in a country where a typical highway drive involves motorbikes-for-four, taxis for 12, the occasional camel — often hauling a massive canvas bag heavy with hay — and frequent trucks driving the wrong way up the “shoulder” of the two-lane road. Even for a pair of lead-footed Miami drivers, the roadways occasionally proved terrifying. \nBut driving was, we figured, the best way to make this trip through a netherworld wedged between historic fantasy and the modern, glassy “technical institutes” sprouting throughout the countryside. We booked our trip in an Ambassador, the white boxy Indian car based on the 1958 Morris Oxford with curved roof and fenders and circular headlights so adorable you almost expect to see eyelashes. Hindustan Motors still makes them, and Namaste offers service in them as a nod to Return-to-the-Raj travelers like us. The modern version has air conditioning — a necessity in India at every time of year — and reasonable shock absorbers. One of Namaste’s modern sedans would likely have been more comfortable, but where’s the romance in that? Thanks to Mr. Hukam, our “king of Indian roads” appeared freshly washed for every outing. On to Jaipur \nSoon after arriving in Delhi we are hurtling down highways, dodging cars, motorbikes and general insanity, and we understand all too well why Mr. Hukam has stopped to pay homage at a temple on the highway just beyond Delhi. It would take the grace of every deity in the pantheon to ensure safety. \nCities give way to fields worked by women in bright saris and roadways clogged with camels and horse carts, cargo trucks decked with garlands, tractors, cows, Jeep taxis with a dozen inside. And, as we approach Jaipur, elephants chalked with elaborate designs — leftovers from the elephant festival we’ve just missed — accompany us on the road. \nOur Jaipur lodging turns out to be the most beautiful of the trip, a renovated haveli, or private mansion, owned by a royal family. (India boasts multiple royal families, a hangover from the time of regional potentates.) Two dozen rooms flank a three-level courtyard, with a sunny pool and carved rooftop breezeway on top; breakfast is served in a white banquet room adorned with frescos and chandeliers that at once is both stunning and simple. Our corner room features high ceilings, colonial furniture, a comfy bed large enough for the 6-foot-4-inch husband and a fresh new bathroom. \nOther lodgings aren’t quite as atmospheric, but all are comfortable and clean. One features a wide chair swing on a breezy balcony; at another, we’re served a simple private rooftop dinner in view of a lake and centuries-old palace. When one hotel features a surly staff, poor air conditioning and shabby grounds a little too reminiscent of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel pre-renovation stage, Mr. Hakum swiftly calls Jawahar, who has us swept away to a clean, friendly and blessedly cool guesthouse nearby. \nThe one drawback to several of the lodgings is their distance from the city center; even with Mr. Hakum perpetually at our call, we would have preferred the option of wandering to restaurants and shops on our own. \nOur itinerary called for visits to the capital of Delhi; on to Rajasthan’s pink city of Jaipur, Pushkar (famed for its annual camel fair, which unfortunately we’ll miss); the lakeside palaces of Udaipur; the fort city of Bundi; the tiger preserve of Ranthambhore; Agra for the Taj Mahal, and back to Delhi. \nAnd generally things go according to plan, in that “Ye hai India” kind of way. Jaipur’s lacy Hawal Mahar palace is closed the day we visit (just as well; on my last trip, I literally passed out from heat in a corner of its stairwell), but we’re completely charmed by our elephant ride up to the mazelike Amber Fort. Illness and kindness \nThe one thing that truly disrupts us is queasiness that turns into full stomach revolt, causing us to cancel our camel ride in Pushkar and ask the hotel to call a doctor ASAP. The ensuing illness — and we’ve been so careful! — causes us to spend an extra night in Pushkar. Mr. Hukam graciously rearranges the rest of the itinerary so we’ll still be able to hit all the highlights. \nAs unpleasant as it is, the incident also brings out the kindness that I have witnessed before amid India’s unfathomable cacophony. The doctor arrives promptly with antibiotics and rehydration salts in his pocket and then tells us to pay whatever we wish, finally allowing as how $12 is the going rate. (We pay $20, and are grateful we’ve done so when a second visit from him is required.) \nWe resume our journey, taking in the vintage Rolls Royces and Model T’s in the auto collection of a polo-playing royal; palaces converted to five-star hotels; mud villages;, parading pilgrims; ramshackle “communities” right out of “Slumdog Millionaire;” and the exquisite sandstone temple that served as the final resting place for the Tom Wilkinson character in the original Marigold Hotel. \nAt last, we reach the Taj Mahal. Years ago, taxis motored right up to the elephant-sized gates, navigating easily through a relative handful of local people and touring foreigners. Today, the grounds are mobbed with tourists and local visitors reaping benefits of India’s growing prosperity, and cars must drop visitors at the park’s edge. A brief haggle with a pedicab driver, and we’re bouncing through stalls hawking Taj Mahal snow globes and key rings on our way to the sculptured garden. \nBuilt by Shah Jahan in 1632 to honor his beloved wife, the project nearly bankrupted the royal treasury, leading the shah’s sons to imprison their father before he could spend the remainder of their inheritance on the black marble version planned for the opposite side of the muddy Ganges river. Unlike so many other world wonders, this one outshines all photos and imagination, and though I’ve been here twice before, the massive white marble mausoleum still leaves me breathless. \nAs does India itself. Sure, the humidity is stifling, the crowds oppressive, the traffic maddening. But as the Exotic Marigold Hotel residents discover, the welcome is as warm as the sun on a camel’s back.
