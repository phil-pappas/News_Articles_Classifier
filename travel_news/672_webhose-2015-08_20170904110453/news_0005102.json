A major pitfall here is that the information on Iran and tourism attractions had not been communicated effectively to the Indians; second pitfall is an undue focus by the Iranian tour operators on other countries with little cultural interest on Iran,” he emphasized, who urged a general shift of focus toward countries with few tourist coming to Iran such as India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T22:40:19.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
