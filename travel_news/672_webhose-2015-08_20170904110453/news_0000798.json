According to my local nursery, there is no longer a spray available to control insect pests. I hate to see the blooms being eaten away from the inside.' Your problem brings up more than one issue. The beetles are pollen beetles and they may have migrated to your garden from local fields of oil seed rape, where they feast en masse for a few weeks before seeking pastures new. Although they are annoying, they are just hungry for the pollen of your roses and do not actually “eat them away from inside”, as you suspect. If you want to pick roses for the house, put them in a darkened shed for an hour or two. They will abandon the flowers and search for light. Your nursery is quite right to discourage you from using sprays on “irritation pests” such as this on open flowers. But the information you were given was not entirely correct. Systemic insecticides are still available, but there are other products that work by contact only that have not been condemned, among them natural pyrethrum as in Vitax PY Bug Killer Spray, or one containing man-made pyrethroids such as Scotts Bug Clear Gun! for Fruit and Vegetables. Pollen beetles (Meligethes) are not to be confused with the other common little black pest-y beetles known as the flea beetles (Phyllotreta or psylloides). These do more damage, creating holes in the leaves of plants in the brassica family (e.g. cabbages and radishes, which can be protected under Enviromesh) and garden ornamentals such as nasturtiums. To achieve some control you can coat a piece of card with glue and pass it over the top of affected plants a few inches from the foliage. Surprised by the movement and shadow, the beetles will leap upwards – and so come to a very sticky end.
