Source: AFP\n“We have been poor, we have been outplayed by a superior opponent, and as coaching staff, players and selectors we fully accept the blame for our losses at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge,” Lehmann wrote on Cricket Australia’s website.\n“We don’t walk away from that responsibility, and we have been as up-front as we can over the past few days to explain that’s the case rather than try to find excuses.\n“Not only do we want to be accountable for our efforts, but on behalf of our team I want to apologise for the manner in which we have lost, especially to those tour groups and individual fans who paid to travel to the UK to watch us and to the millions more tuning in at home.”\nWhile Lehmann said he and his squad were comfortable with accepting criticism for their performances, he wasn’t ready to accept cries from some sections of the media that having players’ families on tour has been a distraction.\nDarren Lehmann: 'Selections were wrong' 0:58 Play video\nCricket: Australian coach Darren Lehmann admits he and Rod Marsh got squad selections wrong following Australia's embarrassing Ashes series\nFox Sports 10 Aug 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes “As a group, we have always placed a huge importance on family and while we’re happy to cop criticism for the way we bat, bowl, field or prepare I believe it’s unfair to suggest having families with us as a reason for our on-field efforts,” Lehmann wrote.\nLehmann himself was caught in a social media storm after appealing to the Twittersphere for tickets to an English Premier League match, on what would have been day four of the Trent Bridge Test.\nThe 45-year-old eventually got his wish, but he also received a barrage of abuse from upset Australian fans who suggested he should have spent the time training the players.\nWould like to go to Stoke v Liverpool with a couple of people anyone help? @stokecity or @LFC can you please retweet .\n— Darren Lehmann (@darren_lehmann) August 8, 2015 Thanks so much for the abuse was asking a question that people might help .
