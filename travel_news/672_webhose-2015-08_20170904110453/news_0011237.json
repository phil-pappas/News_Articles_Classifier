In this week's print cover story, I write about the new economic development strategy that Piedmont Triad International Airport is working on to lure major aviation tenants like Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier that in turn could help to boost passenger service. But PTI is one of many regional airports emphasizing their roles as economic development assets now that major airlines have consolidated and left fewer flights to add. (For more on PTI's economic development strategy, read my centerpiece story and listen to my radio report with WFDD News Director Emily McCord .) Golden Triangle Regional Airport, a commercial service airport about 10 miles west of Columbus, Miss., that is much smaller than PTI, ramped up economic development efforts after losing air passenger service. “In 2003, Northwest (Airlines) pulled out, and for an airport like ours, that’s about a third of our budget,” said Mike Hainsey , executive director of Golden Triangle Regional. “At the same time, the economics were changing — companies, including international companies, were starting to look at the South.\" With help from a \"very very aggressive economic development group\" that has helped lure new companies to the airport and surrounding area, the Golden Triangle Regional airport has area has attracted billions of dollars of new industry investments over the last dozen years. The first new company at Golden Triangle Regional was American Eurocopter, now Airbus Helicopters, which opened a plant in 2004 on airport property, Hainsey said. \"Here's an international company locating in rural Mississippi,\" he said. \"It was big news for us.\" The airport has since lured two additional aviation businesses — Aurora Flight Sciences, a manufacturer of advanced unmanned systems and aerospace vehicles, and Stark Aerospace, a global aerospace defense contractor. Truck manufacturer PACCAR built a $500 million engine facility adjacent to the airport. And Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) built a $1.8 billion steel mill nearby. Hainsey said the companies have since expanded. \"They move in, they see how it's going to go and when it goes well, they expand,\" he said. The new industry investments have also helped Golden Triangle Regional keep its existing passenger service, which consists of three Delta Airlines flights to Atlanta. \"It's the jobs that create passengers,\" he said. \nGet Greensboro/Winston-Salem  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T22:33:32.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
