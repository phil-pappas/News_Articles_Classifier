It comes as many British travelers are heading home after summer holidays, including families with school children. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart tweeted that the port was being taken \"hostage\" and that an accord was expected Monday to end the labor dispute. Copyright 2014 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
