Charles and Ray Eames’ LCW chair. Eero Saarinen’s Tulip chair. Marc Newson’s Lockheed Lounge. These are just some of the 20 th -century design icons that have shown incredible staying power, looking just as contemporary now as they did when they were first designed. Homeowners these days are purchasing investment pieces for their interiors that will look just as good in 50 years’ time as they do today and even three centuries ago, buying everything from 18 th -century French classics to mid-century modern masterpieces and future icons. What do they all have in common? They are a mix of style, artistic vision, high quality, long-lasting materials, innovation and skilled craftsmanship. On the top end of the spectrum is rare and exceptional furniture that doesn’t lose value over time: unique pieces, first editions, special editions or very small series. While they may not sell for cheap, they will certainly last you a lifetime and more. Spending money on such museum-worthy furniture – whether vintage or contemporary – is seen as an investment because the designs will continue to stay relevant for years to come. So while you may have to fork out a tidy sum upfront, collectible design will invariably gain in value over time.\nA 1,000-piece limited edition of the iconic LC4 chaise longue designed by Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret and Charlotte Perriand and manufactured by Cassina for the 2014 Louis Vuitton Icônes Collection (Photo courtesy of Cassina)\nTraditionally, furniture collectors come from Europe and the US, but buyers in Asia and emerging markets are slowly entering the picture and the potential is huge. All are well-travelled, cultured, knowledgeable in design and have an interest in art. When people buy design as an investment in Europe and the US, being mature markets, they choose vintage, classic and contemporary design as it belongs to a specific culture, history and aesthetic like Scandinavian, French or Italian design that has evolved over centuries in an environment that was not yet globalised, whereas in Asia they are looking to the future and contemporary design, particularly at international benchmark designers. But even if you favor contemporary, you still need to study the past. A true appreciation of the new can only come with an understanding of the old because if you don’t know what has come before, you can’t gauge if a new piece is going to be interesting or successful or if it is unique.\nMikael Kraemer, fifth generation of the family-run Paris-based Kraemer Gallery specialising in 18 th -century French antiques, says, “Buying the best antiques is like buying the best art, real estate or diamonds: with time, everything increases in value corresponding to their beauty, quality and rarity. Pieces that do well are the three styles of Kings Louis XIV, XV and XVI by the top cabinetmakers like André-Charles Boulle, Charles Cressent, Bernard II van Risamburgh, Martin Carlin or Jean-Henri Riesener. I recommend to collectors to invest because the very best 18 th -century antiques are very reasonably priced compared with the actual prices of paintings.” He cites a top-quality piece in silver his family sold to a famous couturier in the late ’80s. A couple of years later, he sold it for double the price to a collector from the Middle East, who in turn sold it about four years ago, and the price had tripled. This means in about 30 years, it doubled then tripled. Another example is a vase that a collector bought in 2000, then sold for double the price about three years ago.\nSide 1 chest of drawers (1970) by Shiro Kuramata for Cappellini (Photo courtesy of Cappellini)\nCappellini ’s Art Director, Giulio Cappellini, explains the current boom in design, “Today, the public doesn’t see pieces of design only as museum pieces, but rather products to live with every day. Buying a nice piece of design is like buying a painting or a sculpture: it’s something to pass down. This explains the increase in prices.” Loïc Le Gaillard, co-founder of Carpenters Workshop Gallery , whose prices range from thousands of pounds to millions of pounds for contemporary design (including Sebastian Brajkovic, the Campana Brothers, Vincent Dubourg, Studio Drift and Studio Job), notes, “This is a new era where collectible design is growing rapidly. What’s most attractive about collectible design is that the works are limited editions. Over the last five to 10 years, there has been a resurgence in craftsmanship in contemporary design. Artists and artisans are taking time-tested techniques and pushing them further, whilst blurring the boundaries between art and design. We have a huge new space on the outskirts of Paris where artists and designers can work with the finest artisans and specialized technicians to research and develop new ways of working with materials including metal, wood, fabrics and even semi-precious stones.” Cécile Verdier, European Head of 20 th -Century Decorative Arts & Design at Sotheby’s , discloses, “The average amount of our clients’ purchases is around €500,000. 1950’s design, including artists like Jean Royère, Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouvé, is in great demand as this collecting category goes well with today’s interiors and modern paintings. People want to live with their furniture. 20 th -century design has become a real collecting category over the last 10 years.”\nFurniture from Italian manufacturer Cassina , whose archive counts more than 600 extraordinary prototypes that have gained great value over the years, can become collectible for a number of reasons: it could be a limited or special edition, a piece that’s part of the brand’s glorious past and no longer in production or a piece that’s special thanks to its numbering – perhaps the first or last of a series. Franco Albini’s Veliero bookshelf designed in 1940 as a unique piece was never serially produced due to structural problems, but Cassina brought it back to life in 2011 after intensive research. It has become a collectible today with a value in Asia starting from SGD72,512. Some of the 61 unique tables from Gaetano Pesce’s Sessantuna project for Cassina launched in 2011 to celebrate the 150 th anniversary of Italian unification have a market value of €30,000 to €40,000.\nGianluca Armento, Cassina’s Managing Director, remarks, “Mid-century modern pieces have been extremely popular for the last 40 years. They don’t follow trends, have an essential form and are not decorative pieces that can often tire the owner. In the last 10 years, pieces by Charlotte Perriand and Franco Albini have become extremely popular and their value will continue to increase. Gaetano Pesce is a highly-rated artist and, in the past, a number of pieces he designed for Cassina, now part of its archives, have been sold at auction at high prices. I believe that items that have slow growth will keep their value in the long run. Unique pieces signed by their contemporary authors will also gain value. For example, in our Taiwan showroom, architect-designer Mario Bellini created a series of Cab chairs in special saddle leather. They are completely unique and therefore can be highly valued, particularly in 10 years’ time. The value of a piece also depends on other factors such as if the designer is still alive, if the piece is still in production, if the author passes away after producing the pieces, etc. Therefore, quality, authenticity, uniqueness and the impossibility to replicate are key.”\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.cassina.com/en", "http://carpentersworkshopgallery.com/", "http://www.sothebys.com/en.html", "http://www.cappellini.it/en", "http://www.kraemer.fr/"], "published": "2015-08-13T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:12:05.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
