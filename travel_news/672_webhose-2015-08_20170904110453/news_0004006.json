Through her 130 performances per year, from classical ballet to modern dance, she manages to keep a foot in the worlds of East and West, celebrating the best of both. \nNamed one of \"Asia's Heroes\" by Time magazine in 2004, she also received the Excellence Award from The Committee of 100, an elite organization of distinguished Chinese Americans in 2010. In addition to multiple accolades in dance, she featured in an international GAP ad campaign in 2012 and has been photographed for both Vogue and W magazines. \n“Because I’m an artist myself, the reason I like Beijing so much is that the people are very creative and open to anything. Creativity draws my attention and inspires me,” says Yuan Yuan. “The ancient and the modern co-exist in Beijing. It is fascinating – anything you can imagine, anything you can think of, is here.” \nThe ultra-luxury hotel group launched its innovative Rosewood Curators programme in 2013. More than 20 Rosewood Curators worldwide include fashion editor Nina Garcia, film director Johnnie To and top auctioneer Simon de Pury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:27:01.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
