But signs of mistrust linger President Barack Obama has eased some travel and business restrictions, but only Congress can lift the 53-year-old embargo Havana (CNN) Secretary of State John Kerry came to Cuba on Friday and raised the American flag above the U.S. Embassy for the first time in 54 years. \"Thank you for joining us at this truly historic moment as we prepare to raise the flag ... symbolizing the restoration of diplomatic relations after 54 years,\" Kerry said at the ceremony, addressing the crowd in both English and Spanish. Kerry's visit marks the symbolic end of one of the last vestiges of the Cold War. But signs of mistrust linger, and beyond the pomp and circumstance lies a long road back from more than half a century of diplomatic animosity. On Thursday, Cuban state media put out an article in the name of Fidel Castro, writing on the occasion of his 89th birthday, in which he made no reference to the historic resumption of U.S.-Cuba relations but instead waxed on about the damage the American embargo has caused Cuba and the anniversary of the United States dropping an atomic bomb on Japan. The rhetoric from the leader of the Cuban revolution, and the face of anti-U.S. resistance, is not unexpected. But it underscores the long-standing tensions at play as Washington and Havana work to thaw the decadeslong chill in relations. Even Kerry's brief visit reflects the complexities of opening a new chapter of engagement with the Cuban government. He is accompanied by a number of U.S. lawmakers who have advocated normalizing diplomatic and economic relations with the island. Several Cuban-Americans also are part of the delegation. Dissidents not invited to embassy opening But anti-Castro dissidents won't be at the U.S. Embassy ceremony marking the restoration of ties. Instead, Kerry will meet dissidents and human rights activists at another flag-raising, this one closed to press at the residence of the U.S. chief of mission, along with a broad cross section of Cuban entrepreneurs, journalists and artists. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, blasted the decision in a foreign policy speech delivered in New York Friday morning. \"As a symbol of just how backward this policy shift has turned out to be, no Cuban dissidents have been invited to today's official flag-raising ceremony at the U.S. Embassy in Havana,\" Rubio said. \"Cuba's dissidents have fought for decades for the very Democratic principles President Obama claims to be advancing through these concessions. Their exclusion from this event has ensured it will be little more than a propaganda rally for the Castro regime.\" Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and also the son of Cuban immigrants, said it was \"shameful\" that Cuba could bar dissidents from the ceremony and said the U.S. flag should not fly in a country that does not value freedom. \"A flag representing freedom and liberty will rise today in a country ruled by a repressive regime that denies its people democracy and basic human rights. This is the embodiment of a wrongheaded policy that rewards the Castro regime's brutality at the expense of the Cuban people's right to freedom of expression and independence,\" Menendez said in a statement. But Republican Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who joined Kerry as part of the American delegation, welcomed the Embassy reopening. \"The United States will be able to do much more to protect and serve U.S. citizens in Cuba and encourage a better future for the Cuban people with an American flag flying over our embassy in Havana,\" he said in a statement. U.S. officials shrugged off the fact that dissidents were only invited to attend the second ceremony, chalking it up to \"limited space\" at the Embassy flag-raising, which they termed a \"government-to-government movement.\" But it reflected attention to the sensitivities of the regime.
