Singapore’s Changi airport has a swimming pool to float away the time. Picture: Alamy Source: Alamy \nBELIEVE it or not, flight delays can actually be a blessing in disguise, especially if you're stuck at one of these airports. \nFrom golf courses to wave pools and a game of croquet, these airports are truly destinations in themselves. These are six of the world’s best airport terminals. \nIncheon International Airport, South Korea \nEarlier this year, this airport was hailed the world’s cleanest by Skytrax , a UK-based consultancy that reviews airports. \nWhen you’re not taking advantage of the free showers in the hotel-style bathrooms, you can also enjoy a museum, golf course, casino and ice-skating rink. No one would notice if they scraped the “airport” off the sign and changed it to “resort.” — Pradeep Kerai (@pradeepkerai) May 10, 2015 \nChangi International Airport, Singapore \nIt almost seems silly to fly out of this airport — because how many destinations can hold a candle to its awesome attractions? \nThe hands-down coolest thing? A Hobbit Hole inside the Naturally New Zealand exhibit — holla! It’s a hobbit village as depicted in “The Lord of the Rings,” built by some of the same film crew. (OK, the installation ended in April, but something equally cool is bound to replace it.) #Singapore #Changi Instagram by @tdy_t - Middle-earth comes to Singapore! The Hobbiton set is now in Changi Airpor… pic.twitter.com/nRfX97xc21 — Insta Singapore (@InstaSingapore) March 13, 2015 \nNot to be outdone, the Social Tree claims some bragging rights. It’s surrounded by eight interactive booths made from 32-inch televisions with touch screens. You can take photos to send to yourself, to store in the system, or to display on its massive wall. \nFancy a dip before your flight? No problem — pre- and post-flight swims are available at Changi’s rooftop pool. For some serenity, check out the koi ponds and 500,000 plants throughout five indoor gardens, which require maintenance from 11 fulltime horticulturists. \nMunich International Airport \nSometimes you need to take the edge off before a flight — and this airport has you covered in the hippest way possible: It has its own microbrewery. There’s also an in-house art gallery. \nAnd if you get sick of waiting for your flight, there’s always the Audi car showroom above Terminal 1, in case your destination is within driving distance. \nBut Munich’s sweetest amenity has to be the newly opened wave pool, where surfers can enjoy stationary shredding. — SurferToday.com (@surfertoday) August 11, 2014 \nLondon Heathrow Airport \nOften considered the crossroads of the world, there’s very little Heathrow doesn’t have — including a Harrods outpost. \nWhen retail therapy doesn’t cut it, there’s always the Molton Brown Travel Spa in British Airways Terminals 1 and 4, where you can grab a quickie hydrotherapy shower. The therapeutic technique increases your circulation, thanks to all that (water) jet action. \nAnd don’t forget to enjoy croquet on a mini court. — Evolve Events (@EvolveEvents) July 14, 2015 \nAmsterdam Schiphol Airport \nIf you’re still on a high from all that Amsterdam has to offer, and forgot to pick up souvenirs for your loved ones, don’t despair: This airport has Dutch diamond purveyor Gassan, offering cut and polished bling with all the proper certifications. Freaked out by the price on your receipt? Then check out the meditation centre. \nQueen Alia International Airport, Zizya, Jordan \nSure, it’s been known to heat up in Jordan in summertime, but the airport — whose terminals are shaped like desert palm leaves — has taken care of that. In an eco-friendly move, it uses actual rainwater for the indoor garden, cooling everything down in the process.
