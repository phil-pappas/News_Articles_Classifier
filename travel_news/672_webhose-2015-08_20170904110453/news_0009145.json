The Instagramming has started early, it seems, with #nofilter needed. Breathe in the air. Drink in the serenity. And the wine, too. In that order.\nTwo hours’ drive from Sydney, the Convent has just been refurbished. The luxe Premier Suites are contemporary, plush and have a bed so comfortable, I wonder how I can smuggle it home along with the Appelles Apothecary & Lab products snatched from the shower. The old-school charm is still present, with our room only a few steps from the communal lounge that resembles something out of Versailles. Well, let them eat cake, I say. And a wheel of Morbier. And a couple of glasses of red to clink.\nLive it up in a refurbished Premier Suite at Peppers Convent.\nNestled on the Convent’s lot is a kitchen garden with rows of kale, flowers, beets and herbs to service the two restaurants of the hotel, Circa 1876 and Eighty Eight. I tour the grounds with the latter’s chef, Adam Boylson, as he breaks off delicious garden treats to sample, from bright violets to crunchy broad beans. I’m starting to feel a little like a goat (next it will be the washing from the line), or at least a ransacking hooligan.\nThe vibe is full-on country homestead, as sharing the orchard’s yard is the ‘hen mansion’ where the chickens lay their eggs for morning breakfast. The end result is beautiful, bright orange yolk (apparently the happier the hen, the brighter the colour). However, I don’t care for birds, so let’s move along.\nTour the nearby vineyards while at Peppers. Source: News Corp Australia\nDinner at Eighty Eight is a welcome respite from the ‘horrible’ surroundings. Finally, something high-end (insert sarcastic pause here). I’m not one for food recommendations, but this is where I go against all I’ve ever known: ORDER THE DUCK! I’m not ducking around (ha!), chefs start preparing the crisp confit duck three days before it hits the plate. Post-main, I don’t think I can fit in any more, but I also didn’t think Khaleesi would gain the trust of her dragons again, so out comes the chocolate frangipane tart with salted caramel, lemon balm and Chantilly cream.\nNo need to undo the top button of your pants at the table, good sir, for it is a mere stumble to the suite. And from there, a short fall into bed. I can’t imagine the sisters engaging in such merry wine- drinking and decadent dining, which is a shame, because the place really is second to ‘nun’ (come on, you knew it was coming).\nPremier Suites start at $460 per night (including pre-dinner canapés and breakfast for two).
