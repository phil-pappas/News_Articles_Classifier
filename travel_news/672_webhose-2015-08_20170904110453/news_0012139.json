Boasting an average of 40 mbps (megabits per second), IND's Wi-Fi allows more passengers to comfortably stream more movies, television shows and music than ever before. The new technology means IND guests can enjoy wireless speeds that are 8 to 10 times faster than even the largest U.S. airports. \n\"We are dedicated to keeping up with the demands of our customers and responding to their needs,\" says Mario Rodriguez, executive director of the Indianapolis Airport Authority (IAA). \"Travelers, especially our next generation of travelers, the millennials, expect a fast, reliable Wi-Fi experience. At IND, we made a commitment to deliver that better than anyone else.\" \nImprovements to the terminal's wireless infrastructure include nearly doubling the number of access points from 99 to 197. By increasing the density of the access points, IND now has multiple gateways for more people to enjoy faster speeds and better performance throughout the airport campus. \nAlso, the airport recently upgraded from wireless N technology to wireless AC technology. The faster speeds provided by wireless AC, combined with the increased density of access points provides a greater coverage area, virtually eliminating \"dead spots\" in the terminal and allowing speeds 10 to 15 times faster at each access point. \nBest of all, IND's Wi-Fi is free, secure and requires no log-in. \n\"We're pretty unique among airports,\" says Reid Goldsmith, IAA's Senior Director of Information Technology. \"We have implemented a Wi-Fi system where you don't have to sit through an ad or pay for internet access. You connect and go, just like at home.\" \nGoldsmith says IND's IT department will constantly use monitoring tools to measure crowds and usage at the airport. \"As demand for speed increases, we can quickly react and increase our capabilities to meet that demand.\" \nAbout the Indianapolis Airport Authority \nThe Indianapolis Airport Authority owns and operates Indiana's largest airport system.
