As 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a number of books on that period of history are either being published or reprinted in China. Among them, Forgotten Ally: China’s World War II 1937-1945, by British historian Rana Mitter deserves a fresh read. It examines the long-overlooked battlefield of the Far East amid the Western-centered narratives of the war. Homeless residents flock to the streets after an air raid in Chongqing in 1939 (China Daily) Mitter’s book was first published in English in 2013 and has been available in hardcover in China since April. The 45-year-old professor of history and politics at the Institute for Chinese Studies at Oxford University points out in the book that China was the first country to face the onslaught of the Axis powers in 1937, two years before Britain and France, and four years before the United States. Yet, in the West, “many do not realize that China played any sort of role in the Second World War at all”. Chiang Kai-shek, Franklin D Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Madame Chiang at the 1943 Cairo Conference (China Daily) Mitter weaves together numerous historical materials, including declassified government files, personal correspondences and diaries, as well as news reports by both Chinese and foreign journalists. He restores through his writing the images of the brutal war waged on the Chinese people by the Japanese military, and the brave Chinese resistance in the face of invasion. At least 14 million Chinese died during the war, which is more than 17 times the combined 800,000 death toll of Britain and the United States. Mitter reveals that another 80-100 million Chinese became refugees, citing figures from the war archives. Unfortunately, China’s wartime sacrifices have largely faded from Western narratives and the country’s role in the war has not been properly recognised. “If China was considered at all, it was a minor player, a bit-part actor in a war where the United States, Soviet Union and Britain played much more significant roles,” Mitter writes in the preface to his book. In an earlier review of the English edition, The Wall Street Journal described Mitter’s book as giving China its “historical due”. When the book’s Chinese version was published in 2014, Cao Jingxing, a veteran news commentator and chief editor of Hong Kong-based TV network Asian United Broadcasting, said that had it not been for China’s perseverance against the Japanese invasion, the Second World War would have ended with greater difficulty. Five books give glimpses of war The War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression This novel of more than 2 million words is based on historical accounts of the war. Wang Shuzeng, 63, a major general in the People’s Liberation Army, spent the past six years researching and writing the book, which was published in three parts. At the book’s launch in July, Wang said he emphasised the novel’s characters－Chinese generals, soldiers and civilians, as well as Japanese officers and troops－more than the war. It was published by The People’s Literature Publishing House. The Front Battlefield of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression Written by Zhang Xianwen, director of the Nanjing Massacre Research Institute, and a team of Chinese historians, the book is a comprehensive study of the frontline battlefield where Kuomintang troops fought Japanese forces. It was first published in 1987. Beijing World Publishing Corporation launched a reprint of the book in July. The book seeks to bring to the fore images of major conflicts, such as the Battle of Shanghai and the Taierzhuang Campaign, and analyzes Kuomintang’s gains and losses during the war. Veterans’ Oral History of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression Published in January by Sino-Culture Press, the three-volume book is based on verbal accounts of more than 100 veterans who fought the Japanese military during the Thirties and Forties. Author Li Yao Sha, once an investigative journalist, says he spent 15 years conducting interviews for the book. The veterans shared their frontline stories, including how they escaped death. The Anti-Japanese War in the Eyes of Foreign Journalists The collection is based on the translated writings of nine foreign journalists, who reported on China’s war for different media organizations, such as Millard’s Review, Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, and the Manchester Guardian. Published by Shanghai Scientific and Technological Literature Press, the collection preserves the original texts and adds historical photographs to give a visual tour of the events during the war. Their essays include The Challenge of Red China by German reporter Günther Stein, who wrote about his experience in areas controlled by the Communist Party of China during the Second World War, and The People’s War by Jewish journalist Israel Epstein, who later acquired Chinese citizenship. In 1938, a description of the Nanjing Massacre in Australian journalist Harold John Timperley’s book, What War Means: The Japanese Terror in China, shocked the world after it came out. Fifty Years of Silence: The Extraordinary Memoir of a War Rape Survivor The book is a memoir by Dutch-Australian Jan Ruff O’Herne, who was forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops during the Second World War. O’Herne, 92, was born in the Dutch East Indies, then a south-east Asian colony, and was kept as a “comfort woman” by the Japanese military in 1944. After the war had ended, O’Herne was afraid of bringing social discomfort to her family and didn’t talk about her trauma for nearly 50 years. But she broke her silence in 1992, seeking a formal apology from Tokyo. Her memoir was first published in Australia in 1994. A Chinese version was published in June.
