It also raised over $1.8 million to help people in need. Through the Pebble Beach Company Foundation, which celebrates its 40 th anniversary this year, these charitable funds will benefit 100 local charities.\nThe winning car has an extremely long 145-inch Italian 1924 Tipo 8A chassis, which was acquired in the early 1930s by Swiss Carrosserie Worblaufen to be used as the basis for a new sport cabriolet. The finished car was displayed at the 1932 Geneva Auto Show and won the Grand-Prix d'Honneur at Cannes in 1933. After being shown, the car passed through the hands of just three owners prior to being purchased by current owner Jim Patterson of Louisville, Kentucky .\nAsked what he loved most about the massive cabriolet, Patterson chose to focus on its small details. \"I love the cigarette lighters,\" he said. \"You should see them! I wondered a while ago if they worked, and I've got a blister on my finger to show they do.\"\nThe car's win at Pebble Beach marked the second win for Patterson. His 1933 Delahaye D8S De Villars Roadster was named Best of Show in 2010. \"I won here in 2010 with an all-white car, and now I've won with an all-black car. I don't know if I've run out of colors or what,\" he joked.\nThere were many strong contenders for Best of Show this year, including a 1914 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Kellner Torpedo Phaeton owned by Doug Magee Jr. of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire ; a 1937 Delahaye 145 Franay Cabriolet owned by Sam & Emily Mann of Englewood, New Jersey ; and a 1953 Abarth 1100 Sport Ghia Coupe owned by Grant Kinzel of Calgary, Alberta , Canada.\nConcours Chairman Sandra Button said the win by the Isotta Fraschini wasn't a surprise given its provenance: \"From the moment that Cesare Isotta and the Fraschini brothers founded their company, they were known for building prestigious cars. And this particular car is very stylish and very powerful. Even when resting on the stage, it seems to be in motion, and it is filled with emotion. There is a lot of passion in this car.\"\nFerraris were featured in great numbers this year, along with classic era duPonts, antique Popes, British prewar sports cars and postwar Cunninghams. Special classes celebrated the 50 th anniversary of the Shelby GT350 and the 75 th anniversary of the Lincoln Continental, and Mercury Customs were displayed for the first time.\nFor a full list of award winners please visit: http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net/pages/5371/2015-winners.html\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150817/259005\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141112/158055LOGO\n releases/isotta-fraschini-named-best-of-show-at-65th-pebble-beach-concours-delegance-300129643.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20141112/158055LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/isotta-fraschini-named-best-of-show-at-65th-pebble-beach-concours-delegance-300129643.html", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150817/259005", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150817/259005", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF81103&Transmission_Id=201508172012PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF81103&DateId=20150817", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141112/158055LOGO", "http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net/pages/5371/2015-winners.html"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:55:35.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
