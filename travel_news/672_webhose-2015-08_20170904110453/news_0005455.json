Chairman and CEO Bob Iger announced to an audience of more than 7,500 fans that Star Wars-themed lands will be coming to Disneyland park in Anaheim, Calif. , and Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando . \"I am thrilled to announce the next chapter in the long and exciting history between Disney Parks and Star Wars,\" said Iger. \"We are creating a jaw-dropping new world that represents our largest single themed land expansion ever. These new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet, including an epic Star Wars adventure that puts you in the middle of a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance.\" The future of Hollywood Studios in Orlando had been a topic of discussion among fans for some time. Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted in March at big plans for the theme park , including a potential name change. Meanwhile, reports for a major investment at the parks have been circulating, but nothing had been confirmed until today. The Star Wars lands will have two signature attractions. Along with the battle experience, another attraction puts guests behind the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, as they take on a customized secret mission. Iger also shared concept images of the Star Wars-themed lands, giving fans a glimpse at what is to come for Disney parks. Uou can see some of those in the attached photo gallery. The partnership between Disney and Lucasfilm dates back to 1987, when the successful Star Tours attraction, inspired by George Lucas 's legendary Star Wars film series, opened at Disneyland. The attraction was then redesigned, emerging as \"Star Tours – The Adventures Continue\" in 2011 and featuring more than 50 different story outcomes and the possibility to visit five different planets.
