However, the country is so much more than this. You don’t see everyone in a treadmill, smoking weed while holding some tulips. One thing is true, you’ll see every Dutch person on a bike! The most popular city is Amsterdam, but there are many beautiful places in Holland. Fortunately, the country is not that big so traveling doesn’t take too much time. This way you can see the whole country in a couple of weeks. Here are ten of the best places you can visit in the Netherlands. Amsterdam Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands.

The last three are especially fun for children. Rotterdam Thanks to the impressive architecture, Rotterdam might just be one of the most attractive cities in our top 10.

In the evening you can get a drink at one of the bars near the canal for a perfect view. Groningen For Groningen you need to go all the way up to the North. It’s not that far in comparison with traveling in other countries, though Dutch people might disagree. They are not used to travel for more than an hour within their own country. Unfortunately - depending on where you’re coming from - a trip to Groningen can take up to 4 hours. Groningen is known for the many students that reside here. They bring a little extra spark to the city with their events and enthusiastic lifestyle. This city is definitely worth a visit.
