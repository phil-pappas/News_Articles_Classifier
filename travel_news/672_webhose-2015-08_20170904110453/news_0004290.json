I’ve been searching for travel tidbits that highlight each trip and I found your site. Thanks for sharing, you had a blast 6 years of traveling. I’m jealous! Best of luck for your next adventures. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThanks Mary, appreciate the support. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nSomehow my reply back to you never posted, but I just wanted to say that I am so sorry to hear that 2014 was a rough year for you as well. Much like what you described in your piece, for a while I found myself caught up in the lure of the online world, in all that I thought I wanted my blog to become, but then floundering from too much time spent working for free and paying attention outside of myself, to what others were doing. It sounds like toward the end of the year you were able to find some clarity, and I look forward to seeing how this year unfolds for you too. Be well :) http://www.entrepreneursodyssey.com Entrepreneurs Odyssey \nWOW, what a read. This is my first time here, can you believe it, so much to catch up on. \nThis was an eye opening post for me to begin with, and one that will be in my mind as I read others in the future. I’m happy for you that you’ve made another chapter in your life. Your certainly have a story that the world must hear. Thank you for sharing. \nWifey and I are just going to click over year one on the travel scene, that is after letting go of all strings… http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nCongrats on a year on the travel scene! And thanks so much for the kind words and for reading. I hope our paths cross one day out there on the road. :) Christian P \nBeyond those obstacles you made it through. Congratulations Shannon for your travel and for finding the balance! \nThanks for sharing your thoughts. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Christian, I appreciate the support! :) http://apassportaffair.com/ Megan \nI wandered over from the Daily Mail article (don’t judge). Loved the write-up and did my best to not read the comments..:). I’ll spend some time today reading through some of your back posts! Travel burnout is a real thing. I know enough about myself (’cause I’m old and wise) to know that I need a home base and traveling continuously just isn’t for me. There’s a time and place for everything. I’m sure you’ll find the almost-perfect balance for life, community and travel. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThanks Megan! Glad you wandered over (I kept telling myself to stop reading the new comments too) and that the site resonates with you. Thanks for the support on the balance front — it’s hard to believe it’s already nearly March, but so far I’ve made strides in striking that balance between travel and grounded community. Happy travels. :) UrbanManUSA \nI found the great article you referenced elsewhere on your website called, “10 Types Of Expats.” I was a white collar expat for 5+ years in the 90s. I encountered many of the worst variations of the 10 Types (as well as a couple more). Such dysfunction! Also, when nearly everyone has a departure date in the back of their minds – even if its 2 years away, and especially if it is a few months or less – they aren’t really truly present. Life got to seem really superficial. I reached a point of ennui. I left expat life and have been in the USA since the late 90s. The transition went well. I have a good career going and a strong level of happiness. \nNow however 15+ years down the line, I am feeling the itch to be an expat again. The rat race elements of American life are getting a bit thick. I’d like to believe the additional wisdom that (hopefully) comes with age would allow me to better navigate the expat terrain. Also, I would seek to be in a location where the locals are more inviting (at my previous stops they were in general not) and also a place with a larger population or at least within an hour of a medium to large city (to provide more variety than I had back in the 90s). \nSo, with all the build up, where am I going with this? You’ve been an expat in many environments. You’ve seen the gamut. How much of a difference does a more friendly local population really make? Ditto the offerings of a medium or large city versus a small place – does it make life a little better, or a lot better? Does being older and wiser (bearing in mind my age is probably greater than yours by at least 10 years) make the realities of being an expat easier to process? \nOr is it the case that being an expat has a shelf life, after which you just aren’t going to find it fulfilling? You have your drinks in the sun. And lunches and coffee shop meetings with people of 15 different nationalities. The photos are taken and saved. You experience 100 different flavors of unusual and different. And then that’s it. Been there, done that. \nLooking forward to any comments you might have to offer regarding these ”easy” questions … http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nYou ask some tough questions… its hard to say how you might find some of the places I have traveled, or the ones that feel like home to me. I know that after years in Thailand, one of the things I realized is that as much as I love the culture, there was just never ever a time when I would go beyond being the foreigner. Even if I learned the language, I would be an outsider. I say this because it’s part of what put a shelf-life on my expat life. I am looking for a home base but I want a place where I can truly form a community. For me, I find that it makes a huge difference if the local population is warm and open and willing to accept you. In Mexico, I felt that. I loved the town I lived in for six months and I felt like there was a path toward making it a home if it was what I wanted. \nI think it’s less about expat live being something you grow beyond, and perhaps the connection of a community something that you want. If you’ve chosen a place where that is hard, then it would surely have a shelf life. And yet, there are places and communities where I have met many happy, old, and wise expats loving their lives and feeling connected to friends and the community and living a fulfilling life. \nNot sure if that is what you were looking for as a response, but I hope it helps! \nCheers and best of luck. :) UrbanManUSA \nThanks for the response, Shannon. Appreciate you taking the time and enjoyed your input. We have similar takes on a couple of countries. \nI’ve spent time in Thailand. The culture has its charms, and the cost of living in many areas is appealing. Reality, however, the language/alphabet is completely different, that is too huge for me to ponder tackling. \nMexico currently is at the top of my possibilities-being-mulled list. You mentioned in Mexico meeting, “happy, old, and wise expats loving their lives.” This leads to a concern I have. In the expat community, is nearly everyone either old and on social security, or a redux-hippie 20-something (or acting like one)? I’m in between. Did you find there to be a decent number of people in the 30 to early 50s age range? If so, in what specific locations in Mexico? http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThat’s tough. There are a lot of the two expats you describe, but the others do exist. I am far from the expert on regions of Mexico, however, I really don’t have a good idea of them all. That being said, I think that Guanajuato or San Miguel del Allende could be great… they tend to attract those middle years because they are very liveable cities. Alice \nI like,to hear more about your depression and how you are managing depression. Depression illness is often misunderstood. People with this condition often do not talk much about it. Depression is chronic illness that many have to live with. Please write more about this illness and how you are managing it at home and on the road. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nHi Alice, depression is a tricky one, so I am very far from being the ideal person to be giving advice on how to handle it. I highly suggest that you talk to a professional. That being said, for me, traveling slowly and really staying connected to friends helps. But going home and having a steady home-base was a big part of healing this past year. http://www.nothingrhymeswithrachel.com/ Rachel \nI can imagine the stress. We like to think of ourselves as nomadic creatures, but we’re not really. We like to settle and familiarise ourselves with things. \nAlways remember: you come first. Before the blog, before interviews, before book publishers, before deadlines.
