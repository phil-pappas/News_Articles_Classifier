The travel management company, which already handles domestic travel for public sector workers in England and Northern Ireland, was awarded the contract following a tender exercise managed by the Scottish Government’s Procurement and Commercial Directorate. \nRedfern will provide domestic travel and all ‘one stop shop’ travel requirements across two frameworks that will be available to many of Scotland’s public sector employees. The contract is part of a three year framework agreement with provision for a fourth year. Redfern has already saved the UK government a reported £5m in fees per annum since it was awarded Lot 2 of the Central Government Travel Management Service contract in 2012. Mark Bowers, Chief Executive at Redfern, said: “Redfern is very proud of the working relationship it has with Central Government and now the Scottish Government. “Redfern has continued to invest in the very latest technology and customer service. We are committed to driving out unnecessary cost and delivering innovative solutions for all our clients. “Redfern’s technology supports policy compliance whilst at the same time providing a very simple to use interface. Booking travel in a smarter way will enable employees across Scotland to buy and track travel more efficiently, helping to achieve significant cost savings. “Winning another tender of this magnitude confirms that Redfern’s travel service is first class and offers best value to the British taxpayer.” In addition to public sector partnerships, Redfern has more than 500 clients including a number of large retailers and financial organisations. Redfern is based in Bradford, West Yorkshire, and employs 102 people.
