Europe is a priority market for Costa Rica. “So the start of this new route by British Airways will help attract tourists from across Europe, and specifically from the United Kingdom, making it much easier for them to visit all the wonderful places Costa Rica has to offer modern holiday-makers.” \nDuring summer months the flights will operate on Wednesday and Saturday, departing from Gatwick at 11:55 and 11:00 respectively, arriving in San Jose at 15:45 and 14.50 respectively, with an average flying time of ten hours and 50 minutes. In winter, flights will operate on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, departing at 10:15 on a Tuesday and Saturday, arriving in to Costa Rica at 15:35, and departing at 11:25 on Thursday, arriving in to Costa Rica at 16:45.
