Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong said in June there was no commercially viable jet available and that he was pushing both Airbus and Boeing for proposals. \nThe A350 cabin's architecture features smooth lines. \nRao said the A350 should be able to make the trip with 25 per cent less fuel burn than older models, at the expense of a less dense layout than the usual 325-seat, three-class A350-900, which could be available \"an awful lot quicker than Boeing\". \nSeveral other airlines have expressed an interest in such a variant, Rao said, while declining to identify them. \n\"I can't go into details on the type of layouts they're looking at but it would be a premium service,\" he said. \nWhen Singapore Air last flew to the New York area directly it did so with just 100 business-only seats on a four-engine Airbus A340-500, an arrangement that ultimately proved non-viable. \nThe route, to Newark in New Jersey, was the longest non-stop commercial air service ever offered at 15,344 kilometres. \nBoeing's older 777-200LR - the longest-range jetliner available today - can span about 17,000 km, according to the US company, and will be used by Emirates to fly the 13,821 km between Dubai and Panama from February . That flight will become the longest single sector currently flown, beating Qantas Airways' Sydney-Dallas Fort Worth route by about 20 km. \nThe 777-200LR entered service in 2006 and the last delivery to an airline was more than a year ago in April 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T06:06:55.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
