They struck back with a season-high 15 runs and 21 hits in an emotional win over the Seattle Mariners.\nJust hours before the lopsided 15-1 win , manager John Farrell announced that he has lymphoma and will be stepping away from the team for the remainder of the season as he begins treatment.\n“We as a group have been walking around with a heavy heart today,” Red Sox interim manager Torey Lovullo said, via The Associated Press . “Our leader, our friend and our manager shared some pretty devastating news with us today.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below “We hit just about every emotion that you possibly can, that was topped off with a lot of excitement in the dugout. The guys did that for John. They fought hard and played hard for John today.”\nSpeaking with NESN’s Tom Caron before the first pitch on Friday night, Lovullo said Farrell would remain in the minds of his players throughout the 2015 season. Boston’s record stood at 50-64 when Farrell announced his illness.\n“From my standpoint absolutely, 100 percent,” Lovullo responded when asked if the Red Sox would dedicate the remainder of the 2015 campaign to Farrell. “And I think everyone else is going to feel the same way. Listening to Dustin and David talk, I think everybody is here for John and he’s in our prayers first and foremost.”\nPHOTOS: The Green Monster through the years\nPrevious -- of -- Next Before there was a Green Monster, there was a high wooden fence in the left field of Fenway Park. But it wasn’t as tall, and it wasn’t even green. But the tall structure has been an iconic part of Red Sox history since Fenway opened in 1912.

The incline was used to balance the grade between street and field level, and to seat overspilled crowds. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next A five-hour fire destroyed much of Fenway Park in 1934. When the park was rebuilt, a 37-foot left-field wall with an electronic scoreboard replaced the 25-foot tall, left-field fence.

Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Advertisements draped down “The Wall,” as it was called at the time, until the ballpark ditched wall-ads in 1947. That same year, the wall was painted green, paving the way for the beloved “Green Monster” nickname.

The use of the wall’s electronic scoreboard ended, National League scores were removed, the interior was replaced, a new exterior replaced the old tin panels, and new 6-foot tall padding protected players when they crashed into the wall. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next The scoreboard began being updated by hand from behind the wall after the construction of a center-field scoreboard in ‘76. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next The Green Monster hasn’t been completely rehashed since the ‘70s. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Three 25-foot high “Monster Refreshment” Coke bottles hung from the left-field light tower over the Green Monster from 1997 to 2008. The Fenway/Coca-Cola project benefited the Jimmy Fund. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next The Green Monster was given 269 barstool seats in 2003. Until then, the Green Monster had a 23-foot net above to protect stores on Lansdowne Street from flying balls, and a worker would climb up a ladder to retrieve any balls. The ladder is now obsolete but still in place. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Now, fans regularly enjoy a game from “Monster seats” and look out for flying balls. Jack Maley / Boston Red Sox Previous -- of -- Next Ads were also placed on the wall in 2003—that was the first time since ads were banned in 1946. National League scores were re-added to the wall’s hand-operated scoreboard, and permanent ads were added above the wall.
