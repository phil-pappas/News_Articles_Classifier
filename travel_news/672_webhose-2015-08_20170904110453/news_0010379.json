Source: Instagram \nIF YOU’RE afraid of heights, look away now. \nJust seeing a picture of Toby Segar’s latest stunt is enough to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. \nThe self-described parkour (free running) lover from the UK visited the famous tourist spot Trolltunga, or Troll’s Tongue, in Norway and decided to engage in some thrillseeking. \nTourists flock to the picturesque site which has previously been dubbed as “the scariest Instagram spot on earth” but Mr Segar wasn’t content with getting a regular photo. \nInstead, he had his friends snap a picture as he did a backflip on the cliff’s edge — 700m above the pristine Norwegian gorge.
