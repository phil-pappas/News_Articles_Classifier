Sign In Here Raj Rajkumar , president and CEO of Ottomatika Inc. said he wasn’t looking for his company to be acquired. Since spinning out of Carnegie Mellon University in 2013, the creator of self-driving vehicle software has worked closely with Delphi Automotive PLC. The automotive parts manufacturer was the Pittsburgh-based startup’s first customer and partner, and in April, the two completed a 3,400-mile cross country trek with a vehicle traveling from San Francisco to New York in autonomous mode 99 percent of the time. And while he wasn’t actively looking for a deal, on Aug. 4, Ottomatika announced it was being acquired by Delphi. “We were presented with an attractive offer and had already been working together so closely that it made sense,” Rajkumar said, declining to provide financial terms of the deal. But more broadly, Ottomatika’s deal with Dephi further cements Pittsburgh’s growing reputation as a hub for self-driving robotics, Rajkumar said. Having stepped down from his post at the company as a result of the acquisition, Rajkumar continues as a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at CMU and has led many of the university’s efforts in autonomous vehicle technology. “Given that Uber has its Advanced Technologies Center here and Delphi has acquired Ottomatika, it points to Pittsburgh as being a very active hub for robotics,” he said. “I’m very pleased to be working here in this field.” The San Francisco-based Uber announced in February it would be opening its Uber Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh to focus primarily on the areas of mapping, vehicle safety and driverless vehicle technology. Rajkumar said he has no affiliation with the center. Ottomatika’s 10 employees will stay on to continue to develop the company’s technology and while Rajkumar is leaving, he said there’s plenty of opportunity in Pittsburgh. “I’m going to keep building the next generation of automated driving capabilities,” he said. Ottomatika, which raised $2.6 million from investors last November, also received seed funding from Innovation Works, the region’s largest investor in early stage companies. \nWant Pittsburgh Technology news in your inbox?
