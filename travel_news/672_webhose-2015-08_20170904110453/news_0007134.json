For Trott, the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 was all about the taking part. “I guess my ambition was just to go out and enjoy it,” she said. “I personally don't often get to go out there, cycle and not think about it, so that was fantastic.” An added bonus was that Trott rode alongside her father throughout the sportive. “My dad wanted to go under five hours so that was his target and we did it. That is the first time I have ever done 100 miles and it was great to ride with my dad the whole way. I had to wait for him at the top of a couple of hills but we did it.” That is the first time I have ever done 100 miles and it was great to ride with my dad the whole way The event typified the mass-participation appeal of the weekend. Trott, the Prudential RideLondon ambassador who is in training to defend her omnium and team pursuit titles on the track at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, said she was delighted with the Prudential RideLondon FreeCycle, in which 70,000 people took to the traffic-free streets of the capital last Saturday. “It’s incredible, and shows the way cycling is going at the moment,” she said. “The way I got into cycling was doing it with my family so it was amazing to see loads of happy kids going around London. The 23-year-old from Harlow, won the inaugural Prudential RideLondon Grand Prix in 2013 on the course that laps St James’s Park, taking in Buckingham Palace before a sprint along The Mall. Last Saturday the Matrix Pro Cycling rider finished eighth behind Barbara Guarischi, the Italian who rides for Velocio Sports, and acknowledged an improvement in the standard of the race. “It was much quicker than before,” she said. “It’s a great race to be at and the crowds come out and line the streets cheering your name.” • Discover more information at prudentialridelondon.co.uk Telegraphsportpage Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T22:55:30.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
