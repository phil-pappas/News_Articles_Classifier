The repurchases are intended to be implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws, and any market purchases will be made during open trading window periods or pursuant to any applicable Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and the authorization extends until December 31, 2016. The timing, prices, and sizes of repurchases will depend upon prevailing market prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of stock.\n“After thorough analysis and in consultation with our Board of Directors, we are announcing a share repurchase authorization as part of a capital allocation strategy that we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders and our business. We believe using capital to repurchase our shares at appropriate prices represents a favorable strategic use of capital,” said Colin Reed, chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryman Hospitality Properties. “This reflects our continued confidence in the stability and cash flow generation capabilities of our business model and the strength of our balance sheet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T07:59:24.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
