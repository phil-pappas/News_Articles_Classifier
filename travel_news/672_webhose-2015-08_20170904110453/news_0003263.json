The ship, under construction at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany, will debut this fall in Miami.\nMarine wildlife artist Guy Harvey gets a close-up of the hull of Norwegian Escape, which features his artwork. The ship debuts in November in Miami. (Contributed by Norwegian Cruise Line) Harvey visited the shipyard to see how his artwork is taking shape on the cruise line’s newest and largest ship.\nThe process of creating the design involves using a laser that projects the artwork onto the hull. A team then outlines the art, pencilling in the lines and taping the edges. Paint is applied by hand.\nThe design features Harvey’s signature sailfish, along with Caribbean sea life such as sting rays, sea turtles, whale sharks and tropical fish.\nFincantieri CEO Giuseppe Bono (left) hosted the steel cutting ceremony for Silver Muse with Silversea Chairman Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio at the Genoa-based shipyard.
