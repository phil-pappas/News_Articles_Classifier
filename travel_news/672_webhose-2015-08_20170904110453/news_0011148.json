The year should still finish between seven per cent and 10 per cent up on 2013 figures, he said. \n\n“Within three months, I hope to be back to a normal situation, provided we have no more events,” added Basset. \n\nGoing forward, “we will stay in double-digit growth for at least ten years,” he told TTG Asia e-Daily in an interview after the press conference. \n\nAccor saw 42 per cent REVpar growth in the first six months of this year in Bangkok and 18 per cent in Phuket, Basset pointed out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T08:44:48.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
