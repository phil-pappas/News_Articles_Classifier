Each flight offers 298 seats aboard an Airbus A340-300.\nThe Lufthansa flights are the latest win in the airport’s drive to bring more international flights to the region. Since 2010, international passenger traffic at the airport has increased more than 50 percent. With the addition of Lufthansa, the airport anticipates ending 2015 with a 70 percent bump in international passenger traffic compared to fiscal year 2010. That translates into an increase in visitors to the region’s beaches, restaurants and hotels, and a bump for Tampa Bay area businesses.\nUpcoming events\nAug. 21:\n4:30 – 6:30 p.m.: Mein Heimatland Musikanten\n5:15 – 5:30 p.m.; 6:30 p.m. – 6:45 p.m.: Gulf Coast Enzianer Schuhplattler Dance Group\nAug. 26:\n2 – 3 p.m.: Helmut Drews on authentic button-box accordion\nAug. 28:\n4:30 to 6:30 p.m.: Alex Meixner Band\nSept. 2:\n2 – 3 p.m.: Helmut Drews\nSept. 4:\n4:30 – 6:30 p.m.: DeLeon Band\n5:15 – 5:30 p.m.; 6:30 p.m. – 6:45 p.m.: Gulf Coast Enzianer Schuhplattler Dance Group\nSept. 9:\n2 – 3 p.m.: Helmut Drews\nSept. 11:\n4:30 – 6:30 p.m.: Northern Sounds Band\nSept. 16:\n2 – 3 p.m.: Helmut Drews\nSept. 18:\n4:30 – 6:30 p.m.: Mein Heimatland Musikanten\n5:15 – 5:30 p.m.; 6:30 p.m. – 6:45 p.m.: Gulf Coast Enzianer Schuhplattler Dance Group\nSept. 23:\nSource:- Tampa International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:19:36.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
