Coding is now taught in primary school; it’s no wonder they expect their toys to be smart. That’s why Amazon has created a child-friendly version of its Fire HD tablet, complete with reinforced glass screen and a hardy rubber case to withstand the bumps and scrapes its more expensive and delicate rivals can’t. Children can play games, watch videos and read ebooks through carefully maintained parental controls, blocking unsolicited web browser and social media access, and blocking in-app payments to avoid running up any accidental bills. The toy can help young children develop their rhyming and mathematical prowess, and expand their vocabulary through prolonged interaction But the tablet is not purely designed for leisure use – parents can set educational goals that the children have to meet before they’re allowed to use the tablet for fun, as well as limit how much screen time they’re indulging in each day. Smart learning Education and developed learning is a key focus for this latest generation of connected toys, and keeping the child safe is a priority too. The CogniToys rubber dinosaur answers thousands of questions age-appropriately and can hold conversations with children, including learning exercises. Powered by IBM technology, the toy can help young children develop their rhyming and mathematical prowess, and expand their vocabulary through prolonged interaction. It is currently in development, and will go on sale later in the year. It’s not all about brand new toys, though. There are a few familiar faces who have been updated for the 21st century. Barbie has been given a digital makeover, with a voice recognition-enabled fully interactive version of the doll expected to reach the shops soon. The new Barbie will be able to maintain a two-way conversation with a child over a Wi-Fi connection, and will remember elements of their chat to mention at a later date. It’s one example of how smart toys are helping our children to grow ever smarter. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T21:32:48.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
