Waterfront Toronto's overhaul of Queens Quay - the revitalized street is highlighted by a new bike lane that stretches from Stadium Road all the way to Sugar Beach, which makes for a far safer ride across the waterfront but also a prettier one. The promenade on the south side of the streets has been beautified and will certainly encourage more visits to the lake.
