Insight Asia Travel is doing special tour promotion for A Taste of Vietnam Culture Tour 11 days 10 nights. Hanoi, Vietnam, August 01, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The mid-autumn full moon festival (Tet Trung Thu) is one of the most famous festivals beside the Tet Holiday in Vietnam. It is very much like a good combination of Halloween and Thanksgiving in Western culture. Held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, Tet Trung Thu is believed to be a celebration and prayer for the fullness and completeness of life or to remind the sun to come back after winter, because without the sun the rice will not grow. Dated back thousands of years, the traditions surrounding this festival place a huge emphasis on children. For children, it is characterized by the sound of drums and the twinkle of star-shaped lanterns (den ong sao).One of the most visible traditions related to this festival is the lion dance. There are groups of children parading through the streets, some of them maintain a martial beat on drums while others control an extravagantly decorated ‘lion’ crafted from molds and paper. Children also carry colorful lanterns in the shapes of fishes, stars, butterflies of different sizes. During Tet Trung Thu, mooncakes are the most important traditional food. Thanks to its distinct taste like no other, a famous brand of moon cakes or \"Banh Nuong\" has become known worldwide. It is the brown cake made from egg, pork fat, fried onion, peanut and lemon leaves and tastes salty. You also cannot miss “Banh deo”, the white cake, which is made of sticky rice and filled with sweet mixture of lotus seeds, pumpkin seeds or green bean.Mid-autumn full moon festival is one of two biggest festivals of lantern in Vietnam, especially Hoi An. On a full moon, the 14th day of lunar month, the ancient town’s streets have switched off their harsh, fluorescent lighting, are closed to traffic and transformed by flickering candlelight, multi-coloured lanterns and traditional music.
