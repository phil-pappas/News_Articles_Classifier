However, on a global scale, it accounts only for less than two percent of active tourists. \nThe study, which also looked into the travel patterns of affluent consumers in eight major markets in Asia Pacific, found that four in five, or 82 percent of respondents have traveled with their families in the past 12 months and that they prefer to spend their holidays within the region. \nOver the past 12 months, Japan ranked as the top destination – garnering 26 percent of respondents’ nod – followed by Hong Kong and Australia. \nIn the same period, the survey shows the region’s most frequent affluent travelers are those from Singapore and China (3.1 trips each), followed by Hong Kong (2.8 trips) and India (2.0 trips). \nJames Lim, Visa head of consumer products for Asia and Pacific, said family vacations have become important occasions that affluent families in the region look forward to every year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T22:40:19.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
