It is expected to be supported by the leadership of all three major British parties — Conservative‚ Labour and Liberal Democrats — and to enjoy very strong support in Scotland.\nBut the \"Out Campaign\" is expected to be supported by the right wing of the Conservative Party and the resurgent United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP)‚ as well as many Eurosceptic voters‚ especially in England.\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron has promised the referendum for next year‚ but has not named the date yet. It is expected to be announced once Mr Cameron has finalised the new terms according to which Britain will function in the EU‚ should it decide to stay in.\nVisiting Cape Town in the past week‚ Mr Coetzee said there were many reasons for Britain to stay in the EU.\n\"Economically it makes sense. The EU provides Britain with a huge market. It is also important that Britain play a leading role on the world stage. To lead globally‚ Britain must lead in Europe.\n\"It is furthermore important for Britain and Europe’s long-term security for Britain to be in the European Union. A strong Europe needs a strong Britain.\"\nAsked about a possible return to SA‚ Mr Coetzee‚ who married his wife Jessica (a British citizen)‚ in June‚ kept his options open.\n\"I don’t know what the future holds‚ but I don’t plan to move to SA at the moment. I am focused on the referendum campaign‚\" said Mr Coetzee.\nRDM News Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:20:43.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
