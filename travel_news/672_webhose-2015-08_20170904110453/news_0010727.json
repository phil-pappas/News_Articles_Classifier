Credit: flickr.com/ Simon Bierwald \nWhen I was offered a trip to Dubai, I was not sure what to expect. In fact, I was expecting to be overheated and out of my comfort zone. Instead I was blown away. Who knew paradise was air-conditioned? Because that's what Dubai is - an urban paradise. \nSay what you want about Dubai, but you can't deny that the architecture is something to marvel at. \nLet me take you through the exciting offerings Dubai has for visitors... \nThe scenery Beauty sneaks up on you in Dubai #VisitDubaiSA #Dubai @visitdubaisa A photo posted by Megan Ellis (@megg.ellis) on Jul 30, 2015 at 4:18am PDT \nThe first night I set my eyes upon Dubai, my breath was taken away. Palm trees wrapped in lights lined the streets, while towering skyscrapers watched over the city. \nLooking at Dubai's architecture and attractions, you'll feel like you're in a futuristic city. Even walking into one of the malls, we were greeted by a 2-dimensional hologram guide. \nIt honestly feels like the city is the realisation of what many other cities want to achieve. \nDubai is a place where creativity has flowed freely to create its monumental structures and attractions. The imaginations of the architect and designers aren't stifled by restrictive budgets - rather these architects are able to achieve something which many would only dream of. \nFor example, when Dubai wanted another island, it decided it would build one. And then it decided that not only would it build one, it would build it in the shape of a palm. \nDubai then also went to build a group of islands in the shape of the world map. Dubai also built a ski slope in the city - despite being located in the middle of the desert. \nLooking around Dubai, you start to think anything is possible. \nIf not for the heat, you would forget that Dubai is in the middle of the desert. The streets are lined with trees and plants that give a tropical feel to the surroundings. However don't expect the kind of natural scenery that you see in Cape Town. \nWhile it's not necessarily a place you go to see mountains or forests, Dubai has its own magic as a futuristic metropolis. It's amazing to think that just 20 years ago most of Dubai was just a desert. \nIn fact, the majority of buildings in Downtown Dubai are less that 10 years old. \nStanding out amongst the buildings, like a titan watching over mortals, is the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. The building not only towers over you unlike any other building, but it is also a magnificent sight with its elegant design. \nVisiting Dubai, you are guaranteed to marvel at your surroundings - there is nothing like it in South Africa. \nThe hotels \nLike its buildings, Dubai's hotels are on a whole new level. \nWhen we were in Dubai, we were hosted by Vida Hotels & Resorts , owned by Emaar Hospitality Group . \nWe got to see many of the hotels in Emaar's portfolio, such as The Address Downtown Dubai, Al-Manzil Downtown Dubai and The Palace Downtown. \nWhat quickly becomes apparent when visiting these hotels is that five star in South Africa and five star in Dubai is different. \nIn Dubai, the four star hotels feel like five star hotels in terms of their excellent service, rooms and amazing food. \nMeanwhile, the five star hotels pay attention to detail to an extent that is rarely seen. \nFrom beautiful decorations to stunning facades, many of Emaar's hotels will take your breath away. Wow, The Palace is absolutely stunning. It would be a dream to stay here #VisitDubai #palaceramadan A photo posted by iafrica.com Travel (@iafrica_travel) on Jul 7, 2015 at 3:06am PDT \nEach hotel has its own features which make it unique - such as watching the fountain show from The Address Downtown Dubai to the luxurious atmosphere of The Palace Downtown Dubai that makes you feel like you've landed in paradise. \nWhile I didn't get to experience many hotels outside of Emaar's portfolio, I am impressed enough with Emaar's offerings to choose them if I visit Dubai again. \nBut Dubai's not only about the hotels, it's about what you can do there... \nCity Sightseeing bus tour \nThose in Cape Town and Johannesburg may be acquainted with the City Sightseeing buses - iconic, double-decker red buses with an open roof. \nDubai has its own City Sightseeing branch , offering a range of tours for visitors. \nWe embarked on one of these tours on our first full day in Dubai - and it was a great introduction to the area. \nOur trip was quite short due to schedule constraints, but nevertheless it was still enjoyable. \nLike everything else in Dubai, the bus had air conditioning - but you could choose to sit outside on the back half of the bus if you wanted to brave the heat. \nBeing on the top floor on the bus gives you a unique experience - the view is not quite the same as one you would see from a car. It is less obstructed. \nHowever, still being on the ground, you are in awe of the skyscrapers which tower above the city. \nIf you haven't driven around the city to see the magnificent buildings, the City Sightseeing bus tour is a great way to do this. You get to enjoy the sights in a relaxing environment, not having to worry about traffic or concentrating on driving. \nIf I could choose to go on the tour again, I would - to hopefully see the other sides and parts of the city. \nHowever Dubai doesn't only offer sights, but also experiences… \nHigh tea at At.mosphere \nVisiting At.mosphere provides you with a true look at the luxury that Dubai has to offer. \nThe high tea at the lounge makes for an amazing afternoon treat - as you are plied with refreshments, tasty snacks and desserts. \nMuch of the appeal of At.mosphere comes from the fact that it is located in the Burj Khalifa, on the 122nd floor. \nSo while you enjoy the upscale interior and service of the restaurant, you also enjoy dining in a place which holds the Guinness World Record for highest restaurant from ground level. \nThis makes for magnificent views of Dubai - although sometimes the mist over the city somewhat obscures this. \nMy favourite view of Dubai remains one I saw from At.mosphere, while the food and drinks were unforgettable. \nPictures cannot adequately capture the experience - you have to see it for yourself. \nVisiting At.mosphere also has the benefit that you get to ride in the world's fastest rising elevator - an ear-popping experience. \nThe service at the restaurant maintains the high expectations seen in Dubai, with polite, friendly staff who never leave you impatiently waiting to be served. \nThe treats were absolutely delectable - so if you're wanting to try them all, you better leave space in your stomach. \nHigh tea at At.mosphere was definitely one of my favourite experiences in Dubai. \nThe Coffee Museum A photo posted by Megan Ellis (@megg.ellis) on Jul 7, 2015 at 9:28am PDT \nCoffee has a long history that even many hipsters aren't aware of - but the Coffee Museum in Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood is able to give you a great glimpse at coffee's roots. \nArabian coffee is a unique drink you can try at the museum - unlike any other coffee I've tasted and far different from your lattes and cappuccinos. \nDespite the word ‘museum' conjuring the images of a vast building, this museum is cosy and small, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. \nBeing located in the historical district, you can also see Dubai's roots - the quaint yet sturdy buildings which seem steeped in history. \nI had no idea about the long history coffee has in Africa and the Middle East - but the museum teaches you this. I also learnt about a completely different coffee culture than that which is seen in Western cultures. \nUnlike the gleaming, ultra-modern glamour of Dubai, the Coffee Museum has a rustic, traditional appeal which makes you feel firmly embedded in coffee culture. However there are still the much-needed modern amenities such as a coffee machine and air conditioner. \nVisiting the Coffee Museum makes for an interesting and delightful experience. \nSeaWings Flight \nIf you have a sense of adventure and you're looking for something quite exciting, the SeaWings seaplane tour of Dubai is a definite must. \nThe SeaWings flight was one of my favourite experiences in Dubai. Usually, when you see a city from above, it's as your plane flies over it, with little regard for what makes for a wonderful aerial view (after all, it's about getting from A to B, not giving passengers a sightseeing tour). \nNow imagine a small plane which had the sole objective of letting you see the city - that's what the SeaWings tour is. \nBeing a small plane with only a few seats, the aircraft isn't too packed and gives you a variety of places from which to take your pictures. \nYou take off from the canal, rising into the sky above and finding yourself surrounded by the wonder of Dubai's scenery. \nIn some neighbourhoods, you'll be astounded at how much greenery Dubai has managed to sustain in the middle of the desert. \nYou also get a great look at the Burj al Arab and other well-known attractions, without them being obscured by other buildings. \nDubai was built with design in mind - so the buildings don't look haphazard or unattractive. \nRather, certain sites highlight features of the terrain and complement the surroundings. \nThis is the type of experience you won't get from just flying over a city in a commercial plane - it's one you need to seek out specifically for the sight-seeing. \nWith comfort, excitement and a welcoming atmosphere, a SeaWings flight is something you will not regret. \nDuring the flight you get to see Palm Island, the World Islands, the Burj Khalifa and other awesome sights. \nIf you truly want to see Dubai, this is an amazing way to do so. \nDubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo \nThe Dubai Aquarium is among the world's top 25 aquariums according to TripAdvisor - and during our trip I could see why. \nThe aquarium had an array of animals to see - from the furry water rat to a massive crocodile. Of course, there were also the fish. \nYou truly see a variety of marine life - from tiny clown fish to large sharks. You see the strange and wonderful spider crab, as well as luminescent jellyfish. It truly is an underwater zoo. \nOne of the best sights is King Croc - a five-metre crocodile that weighs over 750kgs. \nWhile I was concerned about the space afforded to King Croc, I read a report on Gulf News which said that the animal's enclosure is three times the size of enclosures specified for the species. \nThe crocodile was born in the wild, but proved to be a problem due to his aggressive nature - killing wildlife. He was then moved to a crocodile farm where he spent 30 years, with his new home being at the Dubai Aquarium. \nIt really is a wonder to see such a massive creature. There were also tiny baby crocodiles that you could view (but not touch) in a small enclosure. \nThe most breathtaking part of the aquarium is the tunnel which runs on the lower level. You will feel like you are submerged at the bottom of the ocean, viewing something which is rarely seen. \nOf course, you're comfortably at sea level. \nIt really is entrancing, watching the sea creatures swim above and around you. \nLocated in the Dubai Mall, the aquarium is something you could stumble upon during everyday activities like shopping. If you like aquariums, you should visit this one. \nAjmal Perfume Received a beautifully wrapped gift from @AjmalPerfumes after our tour of the factories. Contained two wonderful perfumes - an extremely genourous gesture from the company http://t.co/qk5eIx56LZ A photo posted by iafrica.com Travel (@iafrica_travel) on Jul 8, 2015 at 6:51am PDT \nPerfumes are firmly rooted within Arabian culture, with a large portion of the history of perfume coming from within Muslim societies. Ajmal Perfume gave us the opportunity to tour its factories and learn about this history. \nWe were able to see two sides of perfume making - the very traditional manufacturing of oud and the modern creation of contemporary perfumes. \nOud (Agarwood) is formed from the interaction between a certain type of mould and the wood from specific trees. \nOud is extremely pricey - with first-grade oud being one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world. Some of the most expensive oud out there sells for over R1-million per kilogram. \nDuring the tour of the factories we got to know the distinct smell of oud and see how the perfumes and oils are carefully manufactured from the wood. \nThe tour visits two factories - the old factory where oud is refined and manufactured, and the new factory where the modern perfumes are made. \nAjmal Perfume has an impressive array of scents, which you can see bottled efficiently in their factory. \nSeeing the creation of the perfumes gives you an appreciation for the craft. If you want to get a whiff of Ajmal's scents, visit their store in Dubai Mall. \nSheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU) \nWhen travelling, it's important to understand the culture of the place you're visiting. Islam is a religion that many people stereotype, but the SMCCU attempts to bridge the gap between Islam and those from outside the religion to create mutual understanding and respect. \nAt the centre, you learn various things about the religion, but you're also free to ask questions - including questions on more touchy subjects like polygamy and Muslim dress. \nThe people at the centre are extremely outgoing and friendly, keen to share their knowledge and to dispel misconceptions about their religion. \nThey are from different walks of life and hold differing views among themselves. \nYou also get to visit the inside of a mosque - getting an insight that is quite rare for non-Muslims. \nThe visit to the SMCUU was enlightening and gives you a great introduction to Muslim culture. if you like to learn on your travels, this is a place you should visit. \nShopping \nMany people head to Dubai for the shopping. Strangely enough, I did very little of this on my trip. \nThis is because the trip was about seeing the city, not the inside of malls. \nRegardless, I did have some time to do some shopping - all at very different places. \nWe attended the Ramadan night market late into the night, with the area still bustling at 12am. The market was held indoors (thank goodness for air conditioning) and was laid out much like an expo, with stalls creating a grid of pathways. \nThe market had a diverse range of products, from food products to jewellery. \nOur next shopping experience was at the Dubai Mall. Of course, we didn't get to see much of the mall, as to adequately browse all the shops at the mall would take more than a day. \nHowever, I did get to benefit from a typical Dubai sale, which saw 75% off certain products (a shopper's dream). \nFinally, there were the souks (open-air marketplaces) along the canal. This was probably the only place in Dubai that I truly felt the heat. While each shop is air conditioned, the shops are located in an outdoor area where you can't escape the humidity and high temperatures - even at night and you suddenly feel immersed in an authentic experience of Dubai. \nMost of the vendors were selling pashminas and traditional Emirati clothing, however there were also ornaments, souvenirs and paintings. \nVisiting the souk made me realise something - no matter the country, there will be vendors who call out a vague name (‘Lady!', “You!” and “Madam!” were among a few of them) to grab your attention and ply you with discounts so that you will buy their products. \nIt was great seeing the more humble side of Dubai - away from the extreme luxury and opulence. \nConclusion Did a bit of editing of one of my favourite images from my Dubai adventure. My feature on the entire trip will be up soon. The view is from @AtmosphereDubai in the Burj Khalifa #Dubai #burjkhalifa #VisitDubaiSA #VisitDubai A photo posted by Megan Ellis (@megg.ellis) on Aug 18, 2015 at 8:21am PDT \nDubai surprised me in the best way. It's rare that you get to experience a different culture, but also remain in a comfortable and somewhat familiar environment. \nLuxury, creativity and grandeur - this is what Dubai is about. But Dubai also has another side to it for those who want to learn about history. \nDubai is a haven for many different types of travellers. \nWhat it lacks in mountains and natural sights, it makes up for with splendour and imagination. \nIf you're looking for a destination that oozes luxury, which is different from many Western destinations and which will inspire you, Dubai is the place. \nYou can view images of my adventure in Dubai in the galleries below: \n-- \nThanks go to Visit Dubai, Arabian Adventures, Emaar Hospitality Group and especially Vida Hotels and Resorts for taking care of us and coordinating our stay. \nVisit Dubai has a variety of exciting itineraries you can consider for your stay in Dubai. \nArabian Adventures provides excellent transport services which will ensure you get around your destination in comfort. \nMeanwhile Emaar Hotels & Resorts and Vida Hotels and Resorts boast an impressive range of properties which add a whole new meaning to quality accommodation and luxury experiences. \n-- \nDisclaimer: Megan Ellis was a guest of Visit Dubai on behalf of iafrica.com.
