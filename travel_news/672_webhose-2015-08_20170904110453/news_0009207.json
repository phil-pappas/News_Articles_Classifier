There are now four million EuroBonus members who can earn points when buying everything from flights, hotels and rental cars to banking services and food purchases and gain benefits and services that make their travel simpler and better. The new member who took SAS EuroBonus past this magical mark is Stig Christiansen from Norway.\nDelivering clear added value benefits for frequent flyers, the SAS EuroBonus program is an important part of the SAS customer offer. From being a bonus flights program, SAS EuroBonus has been developed into a broad ranging loyalty program with a constantly growing number of partner companies.\nSince the relaunch, the number of new members has grown by around 50,000 a month and now tops four million. Stig Christiansen, 27, from Norway is member number four million and was signed up by his father-in-law and has been rewarded with 200,000 EuroBonus points, enough for example, for two people to fly SAS Business class to New York.\n“We are incredibly proud to have seen such vigorous growth in membership and that we now have four million EuroBonus members. This shows that customers appreciate what we are doing, both in terms of our flight offers and also the offers we create together with our partner organizations,” says Eivind Roald,Executive Vice President Commercial, SAS .\nSAS EuroBonus has Basic, Silver, Gold and Diamond membership tiers and more and more members are reaching the higher tiers that offer greater benefits and simpler travel. For example, Gold and Diamond members enjoy access to SAS and Star Alliance lounges, extra baggage, Fast Track and 24/7 customer service.\n“In the past few years, EuroBonus members have been more satisfied than ever and the program is very popular. There has been a 20 percent increase in the number of trips paid for with bonus points,” says Roald.\nAround 50 percent of SAS’ total revenues are generated by EuroBonus members.\nSource:- SAS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:27:23.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
