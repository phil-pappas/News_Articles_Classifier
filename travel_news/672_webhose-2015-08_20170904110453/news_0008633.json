The local culture of hospitality has deep roots in its Bedouin history: It was simply a matter of survival, and anyone crossing the unforgiving desert was welcomed as a guest. Even though most of Jordan’s Bedouins are only semi-nomadic these days—and you’ll most likely show up in a car rather than a camel—Jordanians remain the most gracious and generous of hosts, and the country is one of the friendliest destinations for travelers.
