Drawing on the timeless surrounds as a source of inspiration, the hotel’s broad spaces serve as a gallery for its custom pieces that include crystal chandeliers, embossed metal artwork, and marble and wood carvings. Located within the Tangshan Kerry Property complex, the city’s first integrated development, the hotel adjoins a shopping mall and landscaped park.\nOutside of the hotel, visitors can see Tangshan’s UNESCO-listed Eastern Qing Tombs – the largest Chinese imperial monument of its kind, relics of the Great Wall or appreciate the coastal city’s porcelain, reputed to be the finest in the north. The destination is equally renowned for Chinese Ping Opera, shadow play and Laoting drums – collectively known as the “Three Flowers of Eastern Hebei.”\nIn each of the hotel’s guestrooms and suites, ranging from 45 to 135 square metres, guests can expect a tranquil base in which to conduct business or unwind. Dressed in natural tones to offset the carpet’s motif of nature in refreshing green, Chinese-style paintings and local ceramic ware play up the classic decor, while free high-speed Wi-Fi, a large workspace and welcoming marble bathroom offer a restful ambience along with views over the park and new city centre.\nWithin the hotel are 34 apartments styled as studios and one- or two-bedroom apartments. All residents enjoy full access to Shangri-La Hotel, Tangshan’s facilities and services.\nOn level 23 the Horizon Club Lounge, fronted by picturesque park vistas, offers special benefits for Club floor guests along with complimentary breakfast buffet, all-day refreshments, meeting facilities and personalised concierge service.\nAt Tang Huang Ge, the hotel’s Chinese restaurant, wooden lattice screens at the entrance open up to elegant surroundings. A chandelier fashioned in the abstract form of a phoenix – the symbol of Tangshan – crowns the centre of the restaurant and each of its ten private dining rooms. Walls are adorned with screens depicting Chinese shadow puppet forms and complement carpet patterns of the China Rose, the city flower of Tangshan. Serving traditional Jing-Dong (flavours of the north of China) and Cantonese cuisines, Tang Huang Ge also features a Peking duck oven.\nCafé Shang will be one of the most exciting restaurants in Tangshan with its spectrum of theatrical kitchens and international and local fare that is served all day. Anticipated to be popular with families and for social gatherings, the restaurant’s glass frontage looks out on to a garden and park, and leads to an outdoor terrace for alfresco dining in the warmer months.\nPositioned to present an unobstructed view of the outdoor greenery the Lobby Lounge, with floor-to-ceiling windows, is an inviting spot for a light buffet and a fine selection of homemade pastries and cakes. In the evening, live entertainment creates a sophisticated place for those wishing to continue the night away.\nGuests at Shangri-La Hotel, Tangshan can take advantage of recreational facilities that include a Health Club with a 24-hour gym, yoga and aerobics studio, an indoor temperature-controlled swimming pool and kids’ pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam rooms, all on level 3.\nWith its opulent interior, high ceiling, crystal lighting and the latest audio-visual equipment, the pillar-less 1,800-square-metre Shangri-La Ballroom is Tangshan’s largest and an ideal venue for a variety of occasions. Together with eight other function spaces, the hotel’s banquet and conference facilities are the largest in the city.\nTo commemorate the hotel’s launch, special rates are available at RMB 588 for single occupancy and RMB 688 for twin sharing until year end. The rates include breakfast, 20 per cent discount on laundry and dry-cleaning, and late check-out at 4 p.m.\nShangri-La Hotel, Tangshan is ten minutes by car to the Tangshan Railway Station and 30 minutes from the Tangshan Sannühe Airport.\nHong Kong-based Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, one of the world’s premier hotel companies, currently owns and/or manages more than 90 hotels under the Shangri-La brand with a room inventory of over 38,000. Over four decades the group has established its brand hallmark of ‘hospitality from the heart’. The group has a substantial development pipeline with upcoming projects in Mainland China, Cambodia, Hong Kong, India, Myanmar, Philippines, Qatar and Sri Lanka.\nSource:- Shangri-La Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:22:48.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
