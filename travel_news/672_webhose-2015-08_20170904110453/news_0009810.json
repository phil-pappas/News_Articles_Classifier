ITV shares added 3.35% to 280.7p as it emerged its biggest shareholder Liberty Global has hiked its stake in the television broadcaster to around 9.9% and broker Liberum reckons the rumours of a takeover are inevitable. 'Liberty has stated it does not intend to make a bid for ITV but its move suggests that it thinks a move by another player is likely or at least an increasing possibility' the broker said. Liberty owned by American investor John Malone last year bought its initial stake of 6.4%. Engineer Rolls saw shares add almost 6% to 794p as American activist investor ValueAct  became the largest shareholder after taking a stake.

The biggest laggard on FTSE100 was Lloyds (LON:LLOY) which shed  3.28% to 83.2p as it set aside an extra 1.4bn for PPI mis-selling as it missed profit expectations in the first half of the year. Interim profits rose 38% to 1.2bn compared to expectations of 1.9bn while revenue slipped back 2% compared to the previous quarter at 4.6bn.
