Now there’s another shop in New York City that has foodies, and the curious, queuing around the block.\nBy 6pm on a Wednesday, 10Below ice-cream shop has already sold out of its most popular flavour — I Love You a Latte, which blends cold-brew coffee with chocolate chips, reports the New York Post .\nAnd yet Edis Kandic, 24, still has to wait 30 minutes for an Oreo-packed Cookie Monster in a paper cup.\n“Last Thursday I tried to get it, but I waited 30 or 40 minutes without the line moving!” says Mr Kandic, who had first seen the ice-cream on his Instagram feed.\nLine up! (Frame content direct link: https://instagram.com/p/5Q6N3PGiD5/embed .)\nEver since it opened in July, tucked between restaurants and spas in Chinatown, foodies from far and wide have been waiting up to three hours to get a taste of 10Below, which serves an American twist on Thai ice-cream rolls.\nThe frozen concoction is created by pouring liquid homemade ice cream onto a cold plate reaching temps well below zero (-18 degrees Celcius). Employees mix in toppings, flatten it out like a crepe, and then scrape it into ice-cold rolls with a putty-knife-like tool. The result is five cute little rolls with toppings ranging from fresh strawberries to a blowtorched marshmallow and Tiny Teddys.\nThe next big thing in ice-cream? (Frame content direct link: https://instagram.com/p/6sEHMqmiGv/embed .)\nThe store offers eight different flavour combinations, each US$7 ($9.80).\nUnlike placing a Cronut in a box, the trendy dessert takes about four minutes to create. But that’s part of the show: The ice-cream makers call you over to their cold plate before they begin so you can get a front-row view — and an ideal spot to snag a pic with a smartphone.\nLeave it to three 20-somethings to create this summer’s most Instagrammable dessert.\n“I kind of quit my accounting job and decided to do this,” founder Richard Tam, 23, says while mashing bananas and Nutella with a slowly freezing crème anglaise ice-cream base to create the shop’s Monkey Business flavour.\nBeary cute (Frame content direct link: https://instagram.com/p/6TRTZXGiHE/embed .)\nMr Tam first saw the freezing technique in a Facebook video of a friend’s trip to Thailand, and he jumped at the chance to turn his ice-cream-making hobby into a career, enlisting his brother Wilson, 28, and friend David Chen, 22.\nRecent university grad Tam found a space in Chinatown — where he grew up — and rounded up his college buddies to work with him behind the cold plates, leading to the shop’s laid-back atmosphere of bros working in backward caps while T-Pain blasts through the speakers.\nMaking the ice-cream (Frame content direct link: https://instagram.com/p/5GQ75tGiCL/embed .)\nLiliana Ma, 23, lives down the street from the shop and has been waiting for the right time to swoop in.\n“Me and my boyfriend would check [the line] almost every day,” she says, comparing her Monkey Business treat to “having Beyoncé serenade you in ice-cream form.\n“Every single bite was the perfect blend of Nutella and frozen banana.”\nAlbert Hu, 23, who waited 40 minutes for a Strawberry Shawty, is less effusive with his praise. “It just tastes like ice-cream,” Hu says. “You could get it anywhere else, but the roll-up is a good presentation.”\nThis story first appeared in the New York Post .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Is+this+the+new+Cronut%3F&c=HERE%26%238217%3Bs+the+scoop%3A+Forget+Cronuts.+This+ice-cream+with+a+twist+has+foodies+queuing+around+the+block+for+hours.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb", "https://instagram.com/p/6sEHMqmiGv/embed", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb", "https://instagram.com/p/5Q6N3PGiD5/embed", "http://nypost.com/2015/08/28/new-yorkers-are-waiting-hours-for-this-freaky-new-ice-cream/", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb&h=Is+this+the+new+Cronut%3F", "https://instagram.com/p/5GQ75tGiCL/embed", "https://instagram.com/p/6TRTZXGiHE/embed", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb&title=Is+this+the+new+Cronut%3F", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/the-quirky-ice-cream-new-yorkers-are-waiting-three-hours-for/story-e6frfq7r-1227504480258?sv=ca887e6f651c3a7e452c7740494acedb&title=Is+this+the+new+Cronut%3F"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T22:11:54.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
