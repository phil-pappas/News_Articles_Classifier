That is a basic description of SoulCycle, the exercise phenomenon that has gripped the Manhattan jet set. SoulCycle filed its IPO prospectus on Thursday revealing a business that generated $112m of revenue in 2014. \nBut that $34 does not just burn a few hundred calories — it comes with an emotional therapy session, which may just be a bargain (and is certainly far cheaper than lying on a psychiatrist’s sofa for an hour). The pitch the exercise studio chain makes is that it is bringing “soul to the people” with instructors who “guide riders through an inspirational, meditative fitness experience”. \nProviding such an experience happens to be financially gratifying too. SoulCycle boasts operating margins of 35 per cent. Not unlike financial services, it seems talent matters as riders develop an affinity for particular instructors. And staff costs are its single largest expense, running at Wall Street-like 45 per cent of class revenue. \nAs it turns out, the psychic benefits of exercise are not just for the well-heeled. A discount gym chain, Planet Fitness, is soon to price its own IPO. It emphasises a “judgment-free zone” without “gymtimidation”. A prospering world demands physical and emotional wellbeing. Clever entrepreneurs have figured out they can be offered in the same venue — at a healthy profit. \nEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
