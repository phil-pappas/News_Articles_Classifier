Goldstein, President and chief operating officer of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. \n“While it is unfortunate that Tom is departing Clia, his desire to put his family first is a testament to his character, and we wish him the best in all his future endeavors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:00:37.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
