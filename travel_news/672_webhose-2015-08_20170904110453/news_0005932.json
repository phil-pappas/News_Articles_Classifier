Right on cue, the returnees say: “Fabulous. The kids had a whale of a time.” “Oh, I’m so jealous,” you lie. “I can’t wait until we go next month.” Now I’m all for the kids having a whale of a time. But the thing about having small children is that, by and large, you’re still able to remember the time when you went on holiday to have a whale of a time yourself. A vision endures of the kinds of things that selfish pleasure once involved. Not Club 18-30 debauchery, mind, but a morning silently ploughing through a fat paperback and then, shortly after midday (very shortly) indulging in a small glass of something nicely chilled. Yum. The de Quetteville men live it up on Gerakas beach, a short walk from the villa Photo: Harry de Quetteville Even those most devoted to their progeny will agree that a child-free hour or two to recharge and, who knows, indulge, can only make for a more relaxed parent. And by relaxed, I mean better. So when I set off with my wife on a holiday on which we could offload our two small boys for a while, I told myself I was acting their best interests. We are selflessness itself, I reassured her. Now let’s have a top-up. Our destination was the south-eastern tip of the Greek island of Zakynthos, home to a cluster of 11 self-contained two- and three-bedroom villas, one of two small resorts run by Simpson Travel in Greece that come equipped with a nursery for children aged six months to 10 years. The other is in Lefkada, another Ionian island, also off the west coast of the Greek mainland in the archipelago in which Corfu is the best-known destination. Zakynthos is an island of mixed repute. If your idea of heaven is downing flaming sambucas in a bar amply festooned with screens showing the latest Premier League football, there is no shortage of places to go. But this is also an island of shady olive groves and azure waters lapping at fine sands. For those who want truly to be alone, some golden coves are only accessible by boat. While not ultra lux, the Simpson resort is certainly in the latter camp. Down a gravel track, the 11 villas sit in three landscaped acres. Paths meander between oleanders, olives trees and the villas themselves, which are set a discreet distance apart from each other. Those paths also lead to the main pool and the poolside café, as well as the creche and nursery. • Skip the beach: why the mountains are better for family trips • Flying with children: 10 secrets to stress-free travel • How to survive a long car journey with children And this is the main purpose of the trip. For it is in the two lovely indoor playrooms and two toy-filled outdoor (but shaded) playgrounds that your darling sons and daughters will spend the time that allows you to unwind. It is here that the selfless magic happens. Sessions run from 9.30-1pm and 1.30-5pm. Those not susceptible to guilt can sign their offspring up to both, giving parents the full day solo, though while we were there, no one chose to do so. We opted for the morning sessions, as our two-year-old and 11-month-old have an afternoon nap. On day one, we were reminded of the truism that you can lead a child to childcare, but you can’t make him like it. Despite the best efforts of the dedicated, warm and friendly team, we returned after less than an hour to pick them both up. Sitting on your villa patio listening to distant wails which you are fairly sure are coming from your own children does not make for relaxing. On the second day, we chose to explore the island for the whole day, as there was no morning session. Instead, the creche offered a 7–10.30pm evening session, during which the children fell asleep in front of a movie, so that parents could settle down to date night. Ours were too exhausted from exploring to participate but, joy of joys, when they returned to the creche the following morning, there were far fewer tears. Activities included painting, playing with the huge range of toys and puzzles, singing and dancing and, outside, a sandpit and an endless number of toy tractors and the like to rumble around on. As we sneaked up to collect our boys, we could see them having that much-promised whale of a time. But what about us? Those couple of hours off were, indeed, bliss. To read uninterrupted and let the eyelids droop occasionally – wonderful. But you mustn’t forget that this is self-catering. Trips to the supermarket are required, and cooking needs to be done, though here, too, support is on hand. The poolside café has a good, if limited, menu: there are great homemade burgers and Greek salads, as well as useful children’s nosh like spag bol and fish fingers, all of which went down a treat. Once the children are asleep, a local taverna will deliver a delicious supper to the villa, laying the table outside with a linen tablecloth Best of all, once the children were in bed, a good local taverna was able to deliver a delicious supper to the villa (menus from £21), laying the table outside with a linen tablecloth, and then leaving us to get on with it. It was lovely, and other guests seemed to enjoy it, too. One finds this sort of thing out, because there an inevitable amount of chat as faces become familiar in the course of the week. Not that there is any compulsion to be sociable: the villas are self-contained and each has its own small pool, which is the ideal size to go in with younger children.

People come from all over the island to wander its glorious, gently sloping shores. But it is just a couple of hundred yards’ walk from the villas, so you can wander down after the fiercest heat of the day has gone and the hordes are packing up. This is the best time to take children, and you can even load up a buggy and trundle it down a ramp to the firm sands. If you have a parasol, you will be directed to one part of the beach in order not to skewer turtle eggs – in late May and June, loggerheads haul themselves out the sea in the middle of the night to nest. Come two months later in the season, and you might see the babies hatch and flip-flop their way back to the sea. In the guest book, several previous residents at our villa marvelled at having done just that. We only had two niggles. The first is that the villas, even under the baking summer sun, are on the sea. Having been shut up, ours felt a little musty and damp on arrival. While this was easily rectified, what was less satisfactory was that washing up had clearly been put away damp. When, for the first time, we pulled out our wooden chopping board, it was covered in mould. • Skip the kids' club: why families need proper holidays • Why is renewing a child's passport so difficult? • How Bear Grylls ruined my family holiday Such details would not have mattered much, were it not for the fact that you begins the holiday shattered and, so, grouchy. The Thompson flight that is part of the package leaves Gatwick on Sunday at 6am. That means being at the airport at 4am. Several families had stayed at the airport overnight, but to no great end: departure time ensured a terrible, sleep-deprived flight for parents and children alike. One mother confessed on Wednesday evening that she had only just recovered. That is a significant chunk of a one-week break. By the end of the week, though, such bad memories had faded into insignificance. The return leg is far more civilised and so, by the time you touch down, you genuinely feel like everyone has had a rest and a real treat. Top tips 1. It’s hot. Put on the air-conditioning as soon as you return after a day at the beach to ensure that it’s cool enough for the children to drop off at bedtime. 2. Exploring the island is fun. The north, away from the coast, is particularly beautiful and can feel quite remote. Rent a car. 3. It’s great to be able to cook, but you’re not here to slave. The café food and supper service are well worth trying. 4. There are lots of good beaches, but you will struggle to beat Gerakas, either for convenience or beauty. 5. After the beach, we enjoyed an early supper with the boys at the taverna closest to the beach, one of several within walking distance of the villas. All seem welcoming.
