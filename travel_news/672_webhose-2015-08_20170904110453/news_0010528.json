The couple had bought their house together four years ago, but when the children started to peel off in other directions to head to university and the working world, they left a hole. The house, Belinda says, felt different. “We were rattling around in the large, lovely home that we had created for our family, and it was quiet and empty.” Belinda Gallop-Iliffe at home Photo: Belinda Gallop-Iliffe Even with their dog Dexter, it was too quiet. The solution was to try Airbnb , the company that epitomises the sharing economy - the ultimate in 2015's trend of sharing for all, in which you can let out sections of your house for others to rent like hotel rooms. Finally, in May, Belinda clicked the button . “After all, if it didn’t work, I could always stop,” she says. “But I love it!” \"The affirmation of having happy guests is enormous. Having one’s home enjoyed and the compliments about the breakfast are all very satisfying\" Belinda Gallop-Iliffe She's not alone . Last year, 10 million people worldwide stayed in an Airbnb residence, and in the last two years, according to new figures from Airbnb, the number of hosts aged over 60 has more than quadrupled. The reason is simple: more and more retirement age citizens are taking to the home-sharing idea, not just to supplement their income, but to stay connected to others around them. Belinda Gallop-Iliffe's house in Thames Ditton Photo: Belinda Gallop-Iliffe James and Belinda’s house has been registered with Airbnb since May this year, and so far they have fielded “approximately 40 guests”. The friend that suggested Airbnb was a host , and felt that their house, now billed on Airbnb as a ‘Hampton Court Palace retreat’, with its large airy spare room to accommodate two guests, would be perfect. The house appeals, Belinda says, because “we are lucky to be just a 10 minute walk from Hampton Court Palace ”. It’s close to, but far enough away from the bustle of central London, “near Wimbledon, important Royal Parks and two racecourses,” she says. “The variety of reasons for guests to visit this area is enormous.” The Airbnb room in Belinda Gallop-Iliffe's house in Thames Ditton Photo: Belinda Gallop-Iliffe But Airbnb isn't just good for filling up space in previously vacated teenagers' bedrooms - it's a good money-maker too . The company’s new figures show that almost half of hosts globally say that they use Airbnb to make ends meet. Over 40 per cent say that it has helped them to stay in their family home, too. Using the sharing economy to fill an empty room, long vacated by grown up children or reserved from infrequently visiting friends and family makes sense. Why not try and make a little bit of money from your empty space? It is not only practical, but, the company say, offers “clear financial incentive.” The figures show that the average host over 60 in the UK earns over £4,400 a year. 61 year old Vickie Shelbourne, who lives in a seaside cottage in Falmouth, is another host who has found Airbnb to be just the ticket . Airbnb host Vickie Shelbourne Photo: Vickie Shelbourne She started hosting guests in the autumn of 2013: “I had a spare room and was working part time, so it seemed like a good idea to supplement my pay.” The idea of having strangers in the house came naturally too. “I lived in France for 20 years and there I was welcoming people into our gite every year for about 12 years, so I was used to being a host, and knew I enjoyed meeting different people. Like Belinda, Vickie was tipped off about Airbnb by friends. “Friends doing the same thing in Brighton recommended it to me, saying it was good fun and rewarding.” So far Vickie has had just under 100 people to stay since 2013. Vickie Shelbourne's cottage in Falmouth Photo: Vickie Shelbourne These have included “a couple of marine scientists from Hawaii, a couple from Ohio, a Danish family working in Ethiopia on an aid programme, Dutch people working in Dubai” amongst other groups from all over the world. “Generally they’ve been a mixture of professional and retired people,” Vickie explains. “I’ve also had a few parents who are visiting their children at the University of Falmouth.” For Belinda, Airbnb also appeals because of how stress-free it is. \"The tricky, organisational and financial part is all arranged by Airbnb,” she says. More and more retirement age citizens are taking to the home-sharing idea, not just to supplement their income, but to stay connected to others around them Since May, she's also taken in guests from all over the world, and from all walks of life. “We’ve even had our first engagement. It was an honour for a guest to choose to propose to his girlfriend here!” It's not just about making some extra money from empty space, but for the joy that Airbnb offers. \"The affirmation of having happy guests is enormous. Having one’s home enjoyed and the compliments about the breakfast are all very satisfying,” she says. ”Most of all, the wonderful variety of people that I am meeting who are travelling for different reasons from different places that is, for me, the most enjoyable part.” “I only have to be careful to let the kids know when there are no bookings so they can visit!” Vickie says. “It works really well for me right now in my life.” @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:17:44.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
