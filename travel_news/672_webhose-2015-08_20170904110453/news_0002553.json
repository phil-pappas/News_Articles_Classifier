The skin on his feet and legs has become so sore that he can barely walk, the Daily Mail reported. Morgan’s parents have tried every treatment available on the National Health Service and are now raising funds to take him for hydrotherapy treatment at a clinic in France. But the boy told his mother on his fifth birthday that he wanted to die rather than suffer any more pain. Morgan also received overwhelming support from other places besides China, and he has received donations worth £33,615 ($52,537) Morgan’s story moved lots of Chinese people once it was published on Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social network. The post on China Daily’s official Weibo account received more than 208,000 views and 251 likes since being posted on Wednesday afternoon. It has also been forwarded 154 times and received 124 comments. Chinese internet users showed strong support and offered their help to the boy. They encouraged him to be strong and never give up.

I used an ointment called Yufubao and was cured within two days. I hope you can get in touch with the parents and recommend this medicine to them. “The ointment is made of herbals, so there is little side effect. But for safety reasons, the patient should first apply it on the hands and feet and then, if it is getting better, on the whole body. On the strength of my own experience I highly recommend seeing a traditional Chinese doctor. “The ointment can be bought online. I don't think it is easy to get it in a pharmacy.” – China Daily reader Chache said in an email to our editors “My kid got severe eczema once and now it’s fully cured. Other kids who had this disease in our neighborhood were also cured. It's a medicine a veteran practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine made himself. Please give me the address of that kid and I'll send the medicine to him. “Poor kid. I know how he is suffering because I had a rash myself. Hope there is a way to help cure him.” – China Daily reader Congheng-Xiaoqingxu said in a Weibo post “I highly recommend The First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. When I had the disease, I spent more than 20,000 yuan on Western medicine, but got no result. But after I tried the medicine the TCM hospital made, the eczema disappeared. It’s not an advertisement. I really want to help the poor kid.” – China Daily reader Yangyang89840 said in a Weibo post “First try to be a vegetarian and avoid any animal protein. Maybe there will be a miracle.” – China Daily reader Crane2003 said in a Weibo post About eczema Eczema, also known as dermatitis, is a chronic inflammation of the skin, associated with dry and crusting patches of hot, itchy and erythematous skin. The affected areas may become broken, raw and may bleed if going severe. It commonly affects the upper hands, elbows, back of the knees and face, devastating people’s confidence and making movement and sleep uncomfortable. The cause of dermatitis is unclear. One possibility is a dysfunctional interplay between the immune system and the skin.
