The drug is made by Amgen for patients with a particularly aggressive form of leukemia.\nThe decision suggests a new willingness by Medicare to help pay for promising therapies that are still being evaluated. After receiving pleas from Amgen and a dossier of scientific evidence, officials agreed the drug was a substantial improvement over existing treatments for some patients.\n Boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert at CenturyLink At issue are special “add-on payments” that Medicare makes to hospitals for new technology whose costs are not yet reflected in the standard lump-sum amounts that hospitals receive for treating patients with a particular disease or disorder.\nIn a preliminary decision in April, the Obama administration said it did not intend to pay extra for Blincyto because clinical studies were “not sufficient to demonstrate” that it substantially improved the treatment of Medicare patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow.\nMedicare officials said Amgen’s application was based on data from “a small sample group of patients whose age demographic is much younger than the age demographic of eligible Medicare beneficiaries.”\nBut in a final rule to be published in the Federal Register on Aug. 17, the administration says it received “additional information and input” from Amgen and other experts and now agrees with their arguments.\nBlincyto “is not substantially similar” to other drugs available to leukemia patients, the administration said, and it “represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing treatment options.”\nJane Wirth, 59, of Reno, Nev., a former preschool teacher, said her cancer was in remission after 28 days of treatment with Blincyto, also known as blinatumomab.\n“It was amazing to me that it could work so well so quickly,” Wirth said in an interview. “I had just spent a month going through standard chemotherapy, which did not make the cancer go away. It seemed so hopeless.”\nThe drug, engineered from two antibodies, harnesses the body’s immune system to help fight cancer. It brings certain white blood cells close to malignant cells so the blood cells can destroy the cancer cells.\nDr. Anthony Stein, a researcher at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif., who has treated more than 50 patients in clinical trials of Blincyto, said: “Its mechanism of action is totally different from that of any other approved drug.”\nAfter the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Blincyto in December, Amgen said the price would be about $178,000 for the recommended two 28-day cycles of treatment, each followed by a two-week break.\nMedicare says it will now allow a “new-technology add-on payment” to hospitals for a fraction of that amount, up to $27,000. Actual payments will vary based on the number and length of a patient’s hospital stays.\nA cycle of treatment begins with intravenous infusions in a hospital. Patients typically continue treatments outside the hospital — at doctor’s offices, at infusion centers or at home, with the help of specially trained nurses — and Medicare will help pay for the drug at those sites, too.\nROBERT PEAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:12:33.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
