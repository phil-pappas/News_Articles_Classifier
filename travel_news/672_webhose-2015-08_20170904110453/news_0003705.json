It sends a potent message that not only does the business community overwhelmingly oppose what the Big Three and their unions are trying to do to Open Skies—but even major elements of their own industry disagree with them as well. \n\"Atlas Holdings, FedEx, Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue have been valuable partners from close to the beginning of the Open Skies debate, all signing an industry letter circulated by US Travel last month. But this new coalition represents a stepped-up commitment against the war on competition inherent in the Big Three's agenda.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:44:49.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
