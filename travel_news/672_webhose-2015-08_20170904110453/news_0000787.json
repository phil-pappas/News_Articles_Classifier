As we get closer, the Corinth Canal shows as a small opening in the coastline. From a few hundred metres off, it looks like an inlet with a ditch running inland. \nIt certainly doesn't look as though a ship could pass through, and even as we enter the canal I have my doubts. \nAs the eye is drawn along the length of the canal, it seems to narrow almost to nothing, although there is a small slit of light at the end. A tug takes Seadream I in tow. We are one of the larger ships to transit the Corinth Canal, there are only a few metres clearance on either side, and we are not permitted to sail through under our own power. Smaller boats and yachts can make their own way, provided they have booked their passage and paid a fee. It's a one-way system, for obvious reasons, and some waiting is involved. The small cruise ship Seadream I is booked to pass through in the late afternoon. But we have to wait until night-time for yachts coming in the opposite direction to clear the canal, and a tug comes to pull us. By then, we pass through the canal while eating dinner at white-clothed tables on the deck. It's an unusual experience, and strangely exciting. There is a feeling of being in a tunnel, but without a roof. It might be claustrophobic but for the stars shining down and reflecting on the water. The Corinth Canal connects the Adriatic Sea with the Aegean Sea, effectively cutting off the Peloponnese peninsula at the bottom of Greece and turning it into an island. It is unusable for most modern ships and cruise liners, but for small cruise ships and private yachts it is a dream route for tourists sailing down the coast of Croatia, then cutting through to the Greek islands (or vice versa). Several cruise companies with \"boutique\" ships make the transit of the Corinth Canal a feature of their itineraries. Supplied \nSeadream is one of the larger ships to transit the Corinth Canal. \nAs we begin our crossing on Seadream I, stewards pass around celebratory shots of raki, the strong local liquor, Greek music plays, and there is an attempt at Greek dancing from passengers. \nThis is a five-star cruise which the Seadream company describes as \"yachting not cruising\". In a mix of relaxed luxury, a multi-course multi-choice dinner is served on deck despite the fact we are halfway through this astonishing mini-canal. \nThe Corinth Canal was completed in 1893 but the idea for a crossing of the isthmus of Corinth goes back 2000 years. \nThe ancients did not have the skills to build a canal but Periander, the Tyrant of Corinth, is credited with building, in about 600BC, a stone road with wheeled platforms which pulled ships overland between the two seas. Traces of the diolkos, or stone road, are visible today. \nEventually the canal was built between 1882 and 1893 by Greek and French engineers. It is dug at sea level, so no locks are needed, but currents and tides, as well as landslides from the walls, make it problematic at times for sailors and ships' captains. \nIn World War II, New Zealand troops were deployed, unsuccessfully, to protect the Corinth Canal during the failed defence of Greece. \nA bridge spanning the canal was destroyed during the attempt to stop German troops taking the canal. Rebuilt, it is today a perfect bungy jumping spot and a popular viewing platform for watching ships squeeze through. Ad Feedback \nThe Corinth canal is about 6.4 kilometres long, 25 metres wide at the top and 21 metres wide at the seabed, and the sides are up to 80 metres high. Seadream I is 14 metres wide. \nSeadream I and Seadream 2 sail through the Corinth Canal on several of their itineraries. The cost for one week starts at about $7000 per person. For details see seadream.com \nThe writer paid her own airfares and sailed at a discounted rate. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T22:16:27.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
