The Inn and its restaurant have welcomed local and international luminaries such as Mick Jagger , Michael Douglas and Sting, who chose Four Columns to celebrate milestone events with friends and family. Economist and Newfane weekend resident John Kenneth Galbraith frequently shared the dining room with Henry Kissinger and other Statesmen throughout the years.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150824/260675LOGO\nSustainability and luxurious healthy living has always been at the core of the Four Columns. In 1965, when the Inn was first opened as a guest house, it was imagined as a top level lodging and dining destination. Operated by Rene and Pierrette Chardain , the Four Columns was the first \"true\" Farm-to-Table restaurant in the United States , preceding the legendary Alice Waters by four years. The pond was stocked with trout, the garden with vegetables and herbs, chickens and pigs were raised onsite and game birds were sourced from local hunters. The Inn became a top notch national destination.\nThe Chardains sold the Inn in 1981, and loyal patrons were heartbroken when after changing owners several times, the Four Columns Inn closed its doors nearly two years ago.\nLooking at the jewel, located in the square of gorgeous Newfane and so easily accessible from New York , Boston and Hartford , Charles Mallory , Founder and CEO of the Delamar Hotels in Connecticut saw an opportunity to restore what he refers to as \"a treasure we couldn't lose.\" Consulting with Chef Frederic Kieffer he decided to put Four Columns back on the map by pairing it with Artisan Restaurant, Tavern and Garden with a continued commitment to support sustainable practices.\nFor the past year renovations have been underway giving it a contemporary new look while preserving its peaceful Vermont roots. All sixteen rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed many with oversized bathrooms, soaking tubs, and fireplaces. Each one is an oasis of tranquility and luxury. \"We wanted to maintain all that people loved about Four Columns and have taken great care to further enhance their experience,\" Mallory shares. To complete the Four Columns' renaissance a Wellness Center and Spa was added with a European style steam room and a fully stocked gym that complimented the outdoor pool. Hiking and snow shoe trails traverse the 138 acres. A picturesque stream and magnificent gardens provide the ultimate country wedding and event destination.\nThe extensive art collection was curated by Diane Birdsall of Old Lyme, CT and is comprised primarily of works from local New England artists. All guestrooms feature unique and original works from regional artists.\nAs the ultimate amenity, Mallory purchased a corporate membership to the private Hermitage Resort affording guests of Four Columns access when available. Hermitage is an exclusive, four-season private club-community that celebrates the outdoors and family fun, with private mountain activities ranging from Alpine skiing and boarding to cross country skiing, snowshoeing and 18-hole golf on a Desmond Muirhead -designed course.\nThe new restaurant at Four Columns, Artisan Restaurant, Tavern and Garden, is the second of an Artisan trilogy. The flagship is nestled at Delamar Southport and the third will anchor the Delamar West Harford (opening in late 2016) which are guided by Executive Chef Frederic Kieffer .\nWith great respect to its heritage the attention to detail and the farm conscious Artisan Restaurant, Tavern and Garden celebrates the abundance of agriculture and food craftspeople of Vermont . From this base of simple and authentic ingredients, Chef Frederic Kieffer and the Vermont team creates plentiful and wholesome dishes that appeal to all palettes and cultivates the Artisan philosophy.\nThe Tavern was envisioned to be a favorite spot to enjoy some simpler fare. Cozy and very casual, friends can gather to enjoy the intimate setting, together with a large flat panel TV for sports, occasional live music and carefully selected libations. The bar features an impressive variety of local beer & hard cider, small batch wines and cocktails.\nThe Four Columns looks forward to welcoming guests to Newfane and sharing this vibrant corner of Southern Vermont.
