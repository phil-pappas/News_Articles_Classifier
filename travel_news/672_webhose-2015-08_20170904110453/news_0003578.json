The most important? \"We wanted it to be a living piece of art,\" says Klai. \"We design resorts,\" says Sparer. \"So it became about creating the perfect entertaining home -- envisioning the best layout and efficiencies to have 200-400 people here and still have our own space.\" After nine years of drawing, planning, conceptualizing and constructing, CAVU Las Vegas , a 13,255 square-foot, Desert-Contemporary home located just 15 minutes from the Strip, embodies their goals. \nIn the years since, the home has drawn the interest of Hollywood producers, Vegas entertainers and music moguls for its architectural originality, entertaining potential, retreat-like privacy and proximity to the city center. CAVU's amenities, many inspired by Sparer and Klai's resort-design sensibilities, accommodate large and small gatherings. \nOn the main level, an imported Italian kitchen with modular dining table, an expansive courtyard, seven fire features, and a pool / spa invite hundreds of guests to mingle. The lower level features a bowling alley, movie theater, fully equipped bar with taps, Vichy spa, steam room and a 1,800+ bottle, digitally-inventoried wine cellar. When it comes to housing the party crowd, \"The main structure is really a one-bedroom home,\" says Sparer. \"The remaining quarters are outside the main home so our guests have their own rooms; there's a casita and top-level suite also.\" \nLocation and thoughtful design ensure high-profile guests maintain privacy. Yet, floor-to-ceiling windows maximize views of the desert and nearby city lights. That combination, along with the solar-panel equipped, 140-foot winglike structure covering the home's south-facing side, inspire the home's name, CAVU , an acronym for the aeronautical term \"Ceiling and Visibility Unlimited.\" The name is a nod, both to the stunning views and CAVU's unlimited entertainment potential. \nTake a closer look at CAVU with short films, floor plans, photos, and virtual tour at www.MeetCAVU.com . \nRUHM Luxury Marketing is a full-service agency of artists, luxury marketers and real-estate consultants who package and promote the world's finest resorts, developments and homes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:53:44.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
