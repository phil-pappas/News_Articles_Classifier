Plane-watchers at Jacksonville International Airport will have an easier time recognizing the aircraft from the area's largest carrier as they show up in town. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) said Tuesday that it would be \"joining a handful of airlines whose planes sport logos on their bellies for easy brand recognition from the ground.\" Those planes carried 1.3 million passengers to and from Jacksonville in the 12 months ending in May 2015, giving the airline about a quarter of the local traffic. (Southwest is the next biggest carrier, with just over 18 percent of the market.) Delta has already painted its logo on the belly of a new Airbus A330. It also has its name on a few Boeing 737-900ER jets , and plans to add the white logo and blue background scheme to its CRJ-200 regional jets, reports the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal, a sister news organization. “It fits with our brand promise of being thoughtful and innovative and really adds a unique element to what is already a sleek and modern aircraft livery,” Adam Pinsley, a Delta graphic designer who came up with the idea, said in a news release. \nWant Jacksonville Travel news in your inbox?
