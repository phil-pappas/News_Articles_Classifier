Not every carrier is offering deals, but there are a lot of flight options to choose from.\nLike most fare sales, the cheapest days to travel are Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday. Sunday is the most expensive day to travel, with Friday a close second. Many of these fares are valid for travel through Dec. 16, with a Thanksgiving blackout period between Nov. 19 and Dec. 1.\nWe have seen sales for travel as far in advance as April 27 on some routes to and from Dallas, and more routes could be on the horizon.\nPlan ahead\nIn most cases, you should plan at least 21 days in advance to get the cheapest fares for domestic travel. When airlines have empty seats to fill, you may occasionally find sale fares that only require a seven-day advance. On some international routes, sale fares may only require a three- or seven-day advance.\nDallas is one of the cheapest markets right now. We’ve seen these under-$130 fares from Dallas to 16 major cities across the U.S., including Las Vegas, Phoenix, Chicago, Denver, Cleveland, Atlanta, New York City, Baltimore, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Kansas City, Austin, Los Angeles and San Diego.\nI can’t recall the last time I saw fares this cheap on many of these routes. We’ve seen Tampa for as low as $97, and the fare typically averages $300. The cheapest city in Texas from Dallas has been Austin at $97 round trip, yet we’ve seen that drop to as low as $77.\nEven though not every U.S. city is on sale, you can get deals by using an alternate city that is on sale. Some markets are still expensive, like Dallas to Green Bay, which is $388, but nearby Milwaukee is $173 round trip.\nRound-trip fares to Boston have been $129, while fares have been $245 to Providence, R.I., $246 to Manchester, N.H., and $300 to Hartford, Conn. By flying to Boston, you’d save a minimum of $100 per person.\nRecently we’ve seen some really cheap fares from Dallas to Tampa, and on select days, you can find fares as low as $97. If you go, you might want to consider traveling the week of Oct. 21. That’s stone crab season in Tampa and Clearwater Beach, and big parties are planned Oct. 23 and 24 to celebrate.\nDon’t forget packages\nWith so many cities selling for so cheap, you’ve got a lot of vacation choices. It’s still smart to look at bundled packages, because often you can get your hotel included for just a little more than the price of airfare.\nAt press time, we booked a two-night trip from Dallas to Las Vegas and found a package for travel Aug. 25-27 with two nights at Stratosphere for $160 per person. That’s a 31/2-star hotel and includes airfare and hotel. On the same dates, we found airfare-and-four-star-hotel packages with stays at the Hard Rock, Luxor, Rio Suites and Treasure Island for less than $182 per person.\nIf you were thinking of having a family reunion, Dallas could be a great place to hold it. Guests can come in from the East Coast or West Coast for less than $130 per person. We have had many opportunities to fly on cheap seats this year, even in peak August, so when this sale ends, there will likely be another sale with great prices.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:22:42.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
