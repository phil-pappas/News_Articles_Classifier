The French agency that usually handles such probes, known as the BEA, can take months if not years to lay out exhaustive conclusions in reports that last hundreds of pages. During the inquiries, they only rarely offer interim assessments and even more rarely comment. \nThe Australian government, which leads the seabed search for wreckage west of Australia, was also less certain than Malaysia, saying only that \"based on high probability, it is MH370.\" \nPublicly, Australian officials withheld criticism of Najib's announcement, with Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss saying Australia respected Malaysia's right to make that call, given it is the government in charge of the investigation. \n\"Of course there is still some i's not dotted and t's not crossed. There is still a very small element of doubt,\" Truss said. \nPrivately, however, there were questions about why Najib had moved forward with the statement before all countries had agreed. An Australian government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment publicly, said Malaysia wasn't supposed to make the announcement and had gone out on its own making a conclusive statement before getting the evidence to back it up. \nAn official in the prime minister's department said the government stood firm on its findings, and defended Najib's announcement. \n\"It is a major milestone in the investigation and the plane belongs to us. We should be the one telling the Malaysian public and the families about this so that no one can accuse us of being insensitive or heartless,\" said the official, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. \nMany families of those on board, who have waited nearly 17 months for tangible evidence, said they were fed up with the mixed messages. \n\"Why the hell do you have one confirm and one not?\" said Sara Weeks, the sister of New Zealander Paul Weeks, who was on board. \"Why not wait and get everybody on the same page so the families don't need to go through this turmoil?\" \nA U.S. official familiar with the investigation said the flaperon clearly is from a Boeing 777. However, a team of experts in France examining the part hadn't yet been able to find anything linking it specifically to the missing plane, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because there was no authorization to talk publicly about the case. \nWith no other 777s or flaperons known to be missing, it makes sense that the part comes from Flight 370, but the U.S. and Boeing team members are merely trying \"to be precise,\" the official said. \nAustralia, which sent an official to France to help examine the flaperon, has said the find will not affect its sonar search of a 46,000-square mile expanse of seabed more than 2,500 miles east of Reunion Island. \nThat search, which began in October, has covered almost half that area without finding any clues. \nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Melbourne Radio 3AW that the apparent discovery of Flight 370 wreckage \"does seem very consistent with the search pattern that we've been using for the last few months.\" \n\"Let's hope we can turn something up,\" he said. \nIntact and encrusted with barnacles, the flaperon was found on a beach and sent to France for scrutiny by the BEA and members from its Malaysian and Australian counterparts. \nAnalysts say investigators will examine the metal with high-powered microscopes to gain insight into what caused the plane to go down. But it won't fully solve the mystery of why the plane disappeared, nor will it help pinpoint where the plane crashed. \nIt is not known why Flight 370 — less than an hour into its journey — turned back from its original flight path and headed in an opposite direction before turning left and flying south over the Indian Ocean for hours. \nA six-week air and sea search covering 1.8 million square miles of the southern Indian Ocean surface last year failed to find any trace of the jetliner. The Reunion Island debris would support the working theory that the jet went down in the Indian Ocean and the debris was carried by the current.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:14:19.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
