Picture: Colleen Petch Source: News Corp Australia\nThe moment he went past his good mate Billy Brownless came at the six-minute mark of the third quarter when he converted a set shot from 40m.\nThat was his 442nd goal of his career but he will have to settle for third given the great Gary Ablett holds the club record on 1021 with Doug Wade a distant second with 834.\nThe other interest for the locals was voicing their displeasure every time Allen Christensen went near the ball.\nHis former teammates were certainly keen to let him know they weren’t going to make his return a nice visit, crashing into him at every opportunity.\nChristensen managed to just 12 touches and had minimal impact on the game but he wasn’t on his lonesome there.\nOther key playmakers such as Pearce Hanley (17 disposals) and Daniel Rich (19) were well down also while Dayne Beams (17) appeared to hurt his shoulder again in the third term.\nThe Lions had only kicked nine goals in its previous two matches coming into Saturday’s game and once again they didn’t have anything resembling a forward line.\nAllen Christensen only had 12 disposals in his first game back at his former home ground. Picture: Colleen Petch Source: News Corp Australia\nThat’s not ideal when you come up against one of the most experienced defences in the business and it was left to one of the Lions own veterans, Jed Adcock, to do the job.\nHe kicked four of his team’s eight goals as youngsters Jonathan Freeman and Daniel McStay struggled to have any impact against the likes of Harry Taylor, Tom Lonergan, Andrew Mackie and Corey Enright.\nThe Lions best was ruckman Stefan Martin who had to carry the load in the second half after Matthew Leuenberger was once again injured, hurting his knee midway the first quarter before being subbed out at half-time.\nCats press conference 6:46 Play video\nAFL: Geelong coach Chris Scott speaks to the media following his team's round 18 victory over Brisbane.\nFox Sports 01 Aug 2015 Sport/AFL/News So was there anything learnt about where Geelong are at from this walk in the park?\nNot a lot really.\nWalker’s efforts were encouraging as the second tall forward given Mitch Clark has disappeared from the equation while Johnson showed there is still a bit of life in the old legs particularly against inferior youngsters.\nThe continued improvement of Josh Caddy (29 possessions) and Cameron Guthrie (28 touches) as elite midfielders was significant while captain Joel Selwood is clearly a happier person since his mid-season break.\nJosh Walker took five marks. Picture: Colleen Petch Source: News Corp Australia\nSteven Motlop continued his rich vein of recent form, regularly being the link man on his way to a lazy 29 possessions which included eight inside 50s.\nBut Chris Scott wouldn’t be pleased with a couple of his younger players who failed to jump on opportunities to have a day out.\nBillie Smedts had a horror first half, dropping easy marks and had six clangers to the main break while Nakia Cockatoo came on late in the third quarter with his only noticeable piece of play a bad turnover which ended with a Lewis Taylor goal.\nLions press conference 0:47 Play video\nAFL: Brisbane coach Justin Leppitsch speaks to the media following his sides round 18 loss to Geelong.\nFox Sports 01 Aug 2015 Sport/AFL/News And Shane Kersten again didn’t get involved enough with just nine disposals and no goals.\nThe day started particular promisingly for the Cats when Johnson snapping a goal 12 seconds into the game.\nHopes for a free-flowing offensive affair were still bubbling along at quarter time with the home team kicking five goals to two.\nUnfortunately the second quarter was more a case of ring-a-ring-a-rosy with the ball spending most of the time going backwards and sideways.\nBoth teams were guilty of it with Walker at least keeping the punters interested by equalling his career-high of four goals by half-time.\nCameron Guthrie starred with 28 disposals and two goals.
