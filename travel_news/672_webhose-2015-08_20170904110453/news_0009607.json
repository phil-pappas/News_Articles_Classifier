The mission is to raise money and awareness for almost 1 billion people worldwide who still have no access to clean water or a safe water supply.\nCycle for Water will be speeding through Bratislava between the 4 and 5 September, taking a well-earned rest at VI Hotels’ Chopin Hotel Bratislava for one night, their second stay at a VI Hotel. They will have travelled 2,226 kilometres to reach Bratislava, stopping by the VI hotel in Loipersdorf first and continuing to Cracow after Bratislava.\nRupert Simoner, VI Hotels’ CEO said, “VI Hotels are delighted to support Theo and Simon in their adventure across Europe. Alongside raising awareness about the lack of clean water in developing countries, their mission reminds us not to take it for granted ourselves. As a big fan of cycling, this campaign really resonates with me.”\nTheir bikes from Theo and Simon are as unique as their mission: bamboo bikes hand made in the UK at London’s Bamboo Bicycle Club. The material is light, hardwearing and, best of all, sustainable and environmentally friendly.\nCharity initiative Cycle for Water was started five years ago by original ambassadors Joost Notenboom & Michiel Roodenburg who cycled 30,000 kilometres between the north and south poles, raising $56,000 in the process.\nSource:- Vi Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:01:43.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
