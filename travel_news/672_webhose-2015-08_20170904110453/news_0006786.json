Close-up views and access to inland travel destinations is a big allure to river cruising, as are the rivers themselves, ancient waterways that have moved commerce, travelers and armies through the centuries. \nDepending on your itinerary, you’ll pass villages and mountains, vineyards and castles. You may find yourself waving to squealing kids out for a swim or cruising past farmers in the fields. There may also be opportunity to watch as your ship is raised and lowered through locks – an experience some find fascinating and others find about as exciting as watching paint dry. \nDepending on when and where you cruise you may hit events such as a grape harvest in France, Germany or Portugal, or perhaps Germany’s biggest party, Oktoberfest. Later in the fall, river cruises get you to the sights and sounds of Europe’s Christmas markets. Five myths about Europe cruises \nOn any river cruise, the idea is you get onboard, check into your comfortable, contemporary accommodations and unpack once, while the ship moves each day to another site on rivers such as the Danube, Rhine, Bordeaux and Seine. Chefs prepare you good food with a local slant, and local performers may come onboard to entertain. If you want handheld, hassle free travel you’ve got it. \nIn some ports, you can walk right off the ship into town. But the reality is, to get to some of the top sights you may find yourself on a bus. When water levels are too low, as they have been this month on the Danube, or too high, you may be on a bus more than you planned. \nShore excursions, often with a local history or culture focus, are included in your cruise fare, and it’s up to you each day whether to partake or not. DIY types will find opportunity to explore on your own (your ships may even have bikes you can borrow). Some people will be content just to catch views from the ship, from the river-view lounge or Sun Deck – or maybe from the hot tub or pool if your ship has one. But the tours are so carefully planned, often with really good local guides, that it seems a shame not to partake. \nFor many, the fact that your cruise fare is at least mostly inclusive is also part of the allure. In addition to shore excursions, wine, beer and soft drinks and bottled water, unlimited lattes and espressos, and internet access are typically included in your cruise fare. \nIn a weird river ship conundrum, you may face having to decide whether to pay for a glass of wine at the nightly cocktail hour – when the cruise director outlines the agenda for the next day – or wait a few minutes for free wine at dinner. \nRiver ships bring small ship advantages. With fewer than 200 passengers onboard, you have opportunity to get to know your fellow passengers (including during meals with open seating dining) and crew. These ships aren’t necessarily for the late-night party crowd – most passengers are over age 55, often way over age 55 (there are exceptions such as the kid-focused cruises Disney is launching next year). Exclusive: Disney expands move into river cruising \nStill, on a recent cruise with Australian-line Emerald Waterways on the lower Danube, there were plenty of people dancing to ABBA on the disco floor at 11 p.m. – the line provides late-night snacks as an energy boost. River cruising may be about slow, leisurely travel, but it’s young at heart. \nFor a deck-by-deck look inside a river cruise ship, click through the carousel below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:04:55.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
