For anyone with a nostalgic streak, an admiration for the female form, and a penchant for extravagance, this will not be an event to miss.\n“ABurlyQ! Burlesque & Sideshow Spectaculár” debuted in the summer of 2011 as a way to present sideshow and vaudeville arts together on stage alongside burlesque, as it was done around the turn of the last century. That event was the first in New Mexico to feature burlesque living legends such as Satan's Angel “Queen of the Fire Tassels” and “The Sparkling Diamond of Burlesque” Gyna Rose Jewel, in addition to recent award-winning and acclaimed performers from across the nation. The practice is now the norm in burlesque festivals throughout the southwest.\nLiving legend Marinka will share top billing for the 2015 \"ABurlyQ!\" festival. Known as the “Queen of the Amazons,” Marinka’s performance career has spanned over five decades and she’ll share top billing at ABurlyQ! event after her performance at the 2015 Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekend's “Titans of Tease” showcase in Las Vegas. She came to the United Sates from Cuba in 1959, and was trained by burlesque legend Rose la Rose in Toledo, Ohio. In the early ‘60's she appeared in Ann Corio's off-Broadway show, “This Was Burlesque,” and was featured in Bob Fosse's 1979 film “All That Jazz.” In 1992, Marinka was asked by legendary actor Tony Randall to be one of the featured dancers in a burlesque-style benefit show for the Actor's Studio at the Lyceum Theater in New York. She just finished work on a documentary called “The League of Exotic Dancers,” and is currently writing her autobiography.\nThe weekend will also offer a host of classes on the art of burlesque, with a complete listing coming soon to http://www.aburlyq.com .\nFor more information on the event visit the ABurlyQ! web site at http://www.aburlyq.com , or follow the event on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/ABurlyQ-A-Burlesque-Sideshow-Spectaculár .

She came to the United Sates from Cuba in 1959, and won a beauty contest in New York City in 1960. Part of the winning prize was a spot in a follies review as a show girl. After a few months, she had a belly dancer spot in the same review. From there, she became an exotic dancer, moving into burlesque. Burlesque legend Rose La Rose helped her in her career and Marinka worked extensively throughout the burlesque circuit of the time, performing as much and as often as she could. In 1979, Director Bob Fosse cast Marinka in the film All That Jazz, with a role of a stripper in a Chicago club. Bob also gave her the name of \"Melanie Hunter,\" which appears in the credit reel. She used the name in films and toured Europe under the moniker. In 1990, legendary actor Tony Randall called her agent and asked her to do a burlesque show with him at the Lyceum Theater in New York. She continued working until 1998 when she had her last contract, after which she became involved with Exotic World, which evolved into the Burlesque Hall of Fame. She also recently finished a documentary entitled The League of Exotic Dancers, celebrating the stars of 1950's, 60's & 70's burlesque. Currently Marinka is working on her autobiography, and lives in Las Vegas. She loves to perform at modern burlesque festivals and loves telling the new ladies how the business was in her time.\nDonna Denise: Donna Denise is an exotic, award-winning burlesque performer from Texas. Her style is uniquely classic with a touch of southern sass. Described by her peers as “a stage powerhouse” and “always one to watch,” she proves to be an audience favorite. Having begun her burlesque career a few years ago, she has already won a multitude of awards including the “Queen of the Sweet Tease” at the Carolina Burlesque Festival and “Queen of the Great Southern Exposure Burlesque Pageant” of North Carolina.” Her ability to dazzle an audience with her twirling skills garnered her win for “Master of Tassels.” \"Most Classic Performer\" and “Legends Favorite” are two of her most-cherished awards, as they inspire her dedication to true vintage striptease. While Miss Donna Denise performs regularly in her hometown of Dallas, she has also ventured across the US, performing in Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, New York, and many more. Gracing the stage in Montreal and headlining Italy’s “Queen of Burlesque” in Milan, have also gained her international recognition. Pin-up Model can now also be added to her list of accomplishments. She has appeared in Pin-up Perfection and was the cover girl for Black Pin-Ups magazine. You can also see her in the recently released hardcover book Chocolate Cheesecake. It is a collection of pin-up images showing a blend of retro-styles of the past with women of the present. Through performing, modeling, and education, this delightful entertainer continues to be a familiar face in the burlesque scene.\nAbout Brown Paper Tickets: Brown Paper Tickets ( http://www.brownpapertickets.com ) is the socially conscious global leader for online ticketing and event registration services, helping people in 68 countries plan, promote and sell out events.
