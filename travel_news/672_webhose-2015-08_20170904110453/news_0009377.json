Some forty percent of the island, or about 100,000 hectares, have been made a national park which include the 2 tallest mountains on the island - the often fire-spitting Piton de la Fournaise and the Piton des Neiges. Also into this category fall the Piton Anchaing in Salazie and the Piton de Sucre besides several other named formations which give the interior of Reunion Island its character. \nFlora and fauna of the interior are equally part of the UNESCO site and a welcome sight from visitors from the cities of the French mainland or from other parts of the world. \nBesides Reunion Island, one of only 34 global biodiversity hotspots, the Gulf of Porto on the French island of Corsica and the French territory of New Caledonia claim the fame of being listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites. \nMore information about the island which is estimated to be three million years old, can be found by visiting their website.
