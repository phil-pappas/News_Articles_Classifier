On this occasion, in line with the Forum’s mandate to serve as a representative group of key global stakeholders, the Board of Trustees elected the following three new members: \nKatherine Garrett-Cox CBE, Chief Executive Officer, Alliance Trust PLC, United Kingdom \nAl Gore, Vice-President of the United States (1993-2001); Chairman and Co-Founder, Generation Investment Management, USA \nMartin Senn, Chief Executive Officer, Zurich Insurance Group, Switzerland \nKatherine Garrett-Cox CBE, a former Young Global Leader and now a member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum’s Forum of Young Global Leaders, is one of the highest-profile women in the City of London. She was cited by the Financial Times as one of the Top 50 Women in World Business, and she is Vice-Chair of The Baring Foundation, a member of the UK Society of Investment Professionals and the CFA Institute. \nAl Gore, Vice-President of the United States (1993-2001) and Nobel laureate, is one of the world’s most well-known environmental activists. He has authored five bestselling books, was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, and spends the majority of his time as chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a non-profit organization he founded that is focused on solutions for the global climate crisis. With his commitment to solving the climate crisis, Gore will help the Forum expand its engagement in developing public-private partnerships aimed at tackling the global challenge of environment and resource scarcity. \nMartin Senn brings more than 35 years of experience in the insurance and finance industry to the Board of Trustees. His organization supports the Forum’s annual Global Risks report, which offers an expert assessment of the top global risks in terms of likelihood and potential impact over the next 10 years. His work with the Forum has helped drive public-private cooperation in identifying, understanding and managing prevalent risks in an increasingly interconnected world. \n“The Board of Trustees shall reflect the multistakeholder concept on which the World Economic Forum is built. It is essential that the Board of Trustees takes a very active role and is engaged in setting the strategic framework for the Forum.
