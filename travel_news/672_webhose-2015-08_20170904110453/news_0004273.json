It had been thought Wagner would get a deal in the $10 million a year range. \nGetting Wilson and Wagner signed to extensions was regarded as a key objective for the Seahawks this off-season, and while it took into two days into training camp, the Seahawks got it done. \nSeattle now has the bulk of its defense under contract for at least the next three years — cornerback Richard Sherman, safeties Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas, linebacker K.J. Wright, defensive ends Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett, and now Wagner. \nSeattle had roughly $4 million in the cap after signing Wilson but with bonuses and other structuring, was thought unlikely to have any trouble signing Wagner. \nWagner had Tweeted that you “Can’t keep everyone” after the Wilson deal was announced Friday. \nAfter practice Friday, the former second-round pick out of Utah State had said he wanted the deal done as quickly as possible. There had been rumblings that the two sides were close before Wilson signed. \n“If it happens, it happens,” Wagner said Friday of reaching an agreement. “But all I know is at the end of the season, y’all will know that I’m the best linebacker in this league. That’s my focus. Everything else will take care of itself.” \nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll had said he was optimistic a deal would get done quickly. \n“We’re on it,” Carroll said of signing Wagner. “Whoever thought that we were done with that thing, that was not right. We’re on it, and we’re going to keep competing to get that done. We have planned for this for a long time, and nothing has changed in all that. Our guys are working at it by the hour here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T07:40:16.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
