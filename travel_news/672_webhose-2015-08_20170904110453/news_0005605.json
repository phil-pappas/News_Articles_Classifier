Not content with serving up widescreen landscapes, glorious weather, white-sand beaches, wonderful wildlife and some of the most exciting cities in the world, Australia also produces superb food and drink. From the green valleys of Victoria to the seafood-rich waters off the tropical north coast, you’ll find high-quality produce, fresh flavours and a genuine passion for culinary creativity. It’s a tough life out there. Australia today is somewhere that takes its food very seriously. This has now become one of the most exciting and inventive food destinations in the world, with original dishes, a huge amount of regional variety and a restaurant scene awash with big-name chefs. This is a vast and often rugged land but the majority of the population inhabits the beautiful and more fertile terrain of the coastal regions and it’s here that you’ll also find the main reasons behind Australia’s ever-growing reputation in foodie circles. This is partly in terms of the purity of the produce, but no less importantly because the country’s laid-back, sun-warmed lifestyle makes alfresco dining a joy. The copious fruits of the coastline can be enjoyed in various ways. Fishing tours, seaplane adventures, beach barbecues and gourmet sailing trips are just some of the options to consider, each allowing you to take in the country’s magnificent scenery while savouring its food and drink. Fresh barbecued fish and seared scallops taste all the more delicious when there’s a spread of soul-soaring scenery in front of you (and that’s before we even get to the wine). Queensland has phenomenal options for food tourists looking for something out of the ordinary In addition to the natural larder provided by its fields, orchards, bays and rivers, Australia also benefits from a hugely multicultural population, particularly in the main coastal settlements. This in turn has led to a rainbow blend of different influences and ingredients, and the rise in popularity of fusion food. Thanks to the relative proximity of their home continent, the myriad flavours of Asia are especially in evidence. It all makes for a truly exciting mix. Making waves: join the Kuku Yulanji people on a fishing trip So in a country where small-scale producers, award-winning eateries, craft brewers and artisan suppliers are now the norm, where to begin with enjoying it all? Thankfully for visitors, there are options for memorable food and drink-related activities right across the coastal regions. And whether you’re touching down in the big east-coast resorts, exploring the stunning seaboard of Western Australia or even delving into the whiskies and cheeses of Tasmania, you’ll find plenty to savour. To really appreciate the appeal of the Australian coastline, it’s always worth a little extra effort. In fact, why not really make a go of it by travelling out to one of the country’s most remote and unique picnic spots? Lord Howe Island sits some 370 miles off the New South Wales coast and plays host to Mount Gower. Undergo a guided all-day hike to reach its summit and you’ll be rewarded with a mountaintop picnic – be sure to try the local kingfish. Back on the mainland, Queensland has its own phenomenal options for food tourists looking for something out of the ordinary. Close to Port Douglas, for example, you’ll find the opportunity to join the indigenous Kuku Yulanji people on a spear-fishing expedition through mangroves and over sandy beaches. Once the necessary crabs, mussels and fish have been caught, the trip culminates in time-honoured fashion: with a seafood lunch at a local family home. Eating well in Australia’s coastal regions comes pretty much guaranteed Port Douglas itself sits opposite the northern stretches of the extraordinary Great Barrier Reef, an area brimming with all manner of foodie enticements. Sample the fare at beachfront restaurant Nu Nu or enjoy award-laden fine dining at Tamarind in Cairns, then push the boat out – literally – with a voyage to Hamilton Island, part of the stunning Whitsundays archipelago. It’s here you’ll find Qualia, previously named the best resort in the world by Conde Nast, where the on-site Pebble Beach restaurant offers coastal dining at its most unforgettable. It’s best enjoyed over a long sunset and a chilled glass of white wine. Up in the tropical climes of the so-called Top End, meanwhile, you’ll find further rewards. The chilled-out, palm-lined city of Darwin offers a number of wonderfully lazy dinner cruises into the harbour, as well as the exotic spread of food stalls that populate the twice-weekly Mindil Beach Sunset Markets. And at the very opposite end of the country, take the chance to visit the dramatic Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, where a tour takes you to collect oysters and shellfish for the evening meal – to really work up an appetite, there’s even the chance to swim with sea lions and dolphins. Exotic: take a wander through the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets And you’ll be similarly well catered for in Western Australia. It has fantastic stretches of sand, among them Cottesloe Beach in Perth, home to the excellent Cott & Co Fish Bar, and Yallingup Beach in the Margaret River region, where fish and chips at sundown is a quintessential Aussie experience. There’s far more to the Margaret River region than its incredible wine – the locally produced chocolate, olive oil, wood-fired bread, truffles and ice cream are more reasons to visit. Sydney’s dining scene is every bit as impressive as its handsome setting Elsewhere, an obvious magnet for urbanite foodies is the city of Melbourne. It’s no coincidence that when Heston Blumenthal decided to give his fabled Fat Duck restaurant an overseas “residency”, he chose Victoria’s cosmopolitan capital. That’s not to say that the food here is all quite so avant-garde. The annual Melbourne Food & Wine Festival (next scheduled for 4-13 March 2016) does a fine job of showcasing the depth and diversity of the region’s offering, from soft-shell crab and Gippsland lamb ribs to south-east Asian food trucks and laneway coffee joints. On which note, incidentally, you’ll be pleased to know that Australia has an almost slavish obsession with good coffee. Relaxing: Sydney balances city vibrancy with chilled out haunts If it’s acclaimed waterside restaurants you’re after, you’ll find plenty more in Sydney. The harbour city is, famously, one of the most relaxed and handsome in the world, and its dining scene is every bit as impressive as its setting. It has two entrants in the most recent list of the World’s Best 100 Restaurants – Sepia, which is Japanese-inspired, and Quay, serving “mod-Oz” dishes – as well as a vast assortment of coastal dinner spots, ranging from Bennelong at the Sydney Opera House which has one of Australia’s most celebrated chefs, Peter Gilmore, at the helm, to historic pubs, rooftop terraces, beachside bistros and arty cafés. Eating well in Australia’s coastal regions comes pretty much guaranteed these days. Whether you visit beach, river, lake or city, you’ll find not just perfectly prepared local dishes but magnificent environments in which to enjoy them. And you know the very best way to find out exactly how good a grilled seafood platter tastes when the sun’s melting over the Indian Ocean and your only worry in the world is which dessert to order?
