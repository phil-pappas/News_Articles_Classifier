The new workers join 175 employees already working at the company’s local operation in the UltraPark free zone.\nCEO of Roche Central America and the Caribbean Stephan Julsing said the investment decision came on the heels of considerable growth in the company’s regional operations in recent years. “We chose Costa Rica based on various factors, such as its political stability, the quality of the human talent and a strong legal system,” he said.\nPresident Luis Guillermo Solís attended the inauguration and said Roche’s investment here represents a vote of confidence in the skills of local talent, which has allowed the company to grow continuously.\nThe new facilities also expand the company’s storage capacity and will help it implement technologies to meet the most recent environmental and energy saving standards, Julsing said at the ceremony.\nForeign Trade Minister Alexander Mora Delgado noted that Roche is one of 11 companies in Costa Rica’s service sector to expand local operations during the first eight months of this year.\nThe Basel-based company launched operations in Costa Rica in 1973. All of its production here is for export.", "external_links": ["http://www.roche.com/about/business/roche_worldwide/roche_worldwide-countrysites.htm?country=CR"], "published": "2015-08-13T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:09:36.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
