The new visa is expected to be effective within 60 days after receiving approval from the cabinet last Tuesday. \n\n“This (initiative) would be better for countries without visa-free entry, like Sri Lanka and India, (which are) possibly target markets for this policy to begin with,” said Willem Niemeijer, founder and CEO of Khiri Group, whose clients mainly hail from countries that have visa-free entry to Thailand. “India, for example, would be a good market for regular short-stay visitors.” \n\nPornthip Hirunkate, managing director of Destination Asia Thailand, commented: “This measure will encourage regional tourists from neighboring countries such as China and India to come to Thailand more frequently within the six-month period. \n\n“This multiple entry visa will be great for corporate travellers who also come in and out of Thailand on a frequent basis, enabling them to save time and effort (instead of) applying for a visa for every visit,” she added. \n\nHowever, the multiple-entry visa fee veers on the “high” side – 5,000 baht (US$142) compared with 1,000 baht for a single-entry, 30-day visa – although industry players expect the convenience offered by the new initiative to outweigh the cost. \n\nFurthermore, there are areas that Thailand could still improve its visa processes, observed the DMC chiefs. \n\nPornthip opined that extending the six-month validity to one year “would be more beneficial”. \nNiemeijer, on the other hand, urges the Thai authorities to make a distinction between arrivals at land borders and airports for travellers with visa exemptions. He said: “Currently, land-border arrivals will get only 15 days, why not make that 30 days as well?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:43:50.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
