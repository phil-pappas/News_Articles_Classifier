LightAPPS can be used to deliver SDN benefits to the current installed base, as well as future SDN networks. Under the terms of the agreement Trafikverket has procured 2 APPS, LightINSIGHT and LightTIME.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141117/158923LOGO )\nTrafikverket (the Swedish Transport Administration) is the government agency responsible for the long-term planning of the transport system in the country. Trafikverket is also in charge of the state road network and national railway network.\n\"Trafikverket had very clear goals in mind when selecting LightAPPS. In order to optimize our current network resources, we wanted a system that would increase efficiency, reduce resources, automate tasks and simplify operations with an intuitive interface and management dashboard for increased visibility. ECI's LightINSIGHT and LightTIME will no doubt help us in our future planning and optimization of the network. We are delighted to continue our long and valued partnership with ECI, which we trust to consistently develop and provide innovative tools and solutions to keep us ahead of the curve,\" said Kristoffer Stromberg , Head of Network Development and Planning at Trafikverket.\n\"Network operations continue to be very resource intensive. As networks grow they progressively become more complex, adding on various layers, a multitude of elements and multiple suppliers. For this reason, customers are constantly looking for tools which enable faster new service activation, while ensuring strict SLA compliance and KPI tracking. We are delighted to continue our valued partnership with Trafikverket,\" said Fernando Valdivielso , VP Sales EMEA at ECI.\nGali Malkiel , Head of ECI's Software Line of Business continued, \"ECI clearly understands Trafikverket's goal to optimize network efficiency and visibility. ECI's LightINSIGHT and LightTIME are perfect for this mission as they provide network analytics at a glance and pre-scheduled services respectively. Today Trafikverket can pre-schedule additional bandwidth to broadcast a big game and know with certainty that this extra bandwidth will be available when needed and then will automatically disconnect afterwards. Predefined templates simplify the process of new service activation, while reducing the chance of human errors. With the LightINSIGHT management dashboard, customers receive a powerful tool for increased network visibility and control. ECI's LightAPPS SDN applications are a game changer in this regard.\"\nLightINSIGHT offers in-depth insights into network resources and their utilization. The APP provides a 360 degree view of the network inventory, utilization trends, network health, as well as the status of new service penetration. LightINSIGHT's management dashboard significantly improves visibility of network resources and customer SLAs by tracking KPIs.\nLightTIME enables customers to schedule services in advance. Via an intuitive GUI, service providers are able to book network resources in advance and know that the allocation will commence as planned. LightTIME also intelligently reduces network bottlenecks and shortens new service introduction.\nAbout ECI\nECI is a global provider of ELASTIC network solutions to CSPs, utilities as well as data center operators.
