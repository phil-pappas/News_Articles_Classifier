Clapton helmed the wardrobes of Game of Thrones for five years, recently announcing that she would not be returning for the show’s sixth season, though she’s surely not short on means to keep busy. We caught up with the designer to talk about her three months in the desert with Herzog, Kidman & co.\nWhat was your research like in preparation for the film?\nI’ve been a fan of [Werner’s] for years, so the idea of working with someone like him was such a gift. When I first spoke to him on the phone, he said, “I just want this one costume, and she’s a bride of the desert.” One costume for a whole film was quite a challenge. Like any job, I started researching [the character Gertrude Bell]. I’d heard of her, but I didn’t really know her story. It was the men’s costumes more than the women’s costumes that actually I decided to take the influence from, looking at the way the Bedouin are, their traditions and the embroidery…I had worked with Nicole before, so we knew each other fairly well. I knew her shape; I knew what suited her and how she is. It was trying to take all that in, and then to make this costume that had a sense of a bride, [which] while being sort of dreamlike, was also practical. It didn’t end up being one costume, because it couldn’t be. But it was the main costume, and probably was worn for three-quarters of the film, I’d say.\nWas working with Werner a collaborative process? What was his relationship like to you as a director?\nHe was incredibly supportive. He said, “You are my creative source, I will celebrate you, I will help you, I will be part of you,” and was very encouraging. Then he just let me go and do it. He came to the fitting, and by the time I saw him, I had come up in my mind an idea of how it should be. As a designer, you always find things and you think, “Oh, one day that might be really great,” and stash it away. I had found this wonderful leather belt years ago that had a sort of strength to it. We put it on, and actually both [Werner and Nicole] instantly fell in love with it, and of course we had to refine it and embroider it and all that stuff, but the shape actually in the very first fitting was established. Werner came to fittings now and again, but he allowed me to do what I wanted to do. I love it when that happens, because you have this lovely rapport and they trust you. There’s nothing worse than a director sort of tapping everything you do, because you feel like you can’t move. Nicole also obviously had a say in things, but she seemed to trust the way it was going. She was very excited by the costumes, and actually when we first dressed her, she said, “I feel like a warrior.” It was great, because in a funny way that’s what she needed to feel—like a bride of the desert.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Benaroya Pictures\nObviously you’ve spent a lot of time designing for Game of Thrones . Did doing something like this, where historical accuracy is more paramount, feel restrictive in any way after coming out of GOT ’s fantastical world?\nThe job I’m doing now [Netflix’s forthcoming drama The Crown ], I would say 100 percent it’s very different. I have to be absolutely precise because it’s about the royal family in the ’50s. But with [ Queen of the Desert ]—yes, I wanted to be incredibly correct about the Bedouin and the way they live and the Moroccan people, but to give artistic license to how Werner wanted Nicole to be, which is this rather dreamlike person, [an] essence of someone. We did actually do correct period pieces for her at other times, and all the Europeans that she met [in the film] were incredibly correct. But it just allowed us this slight artistic license that we wanted for her when she was in the desert, that she embraced the ways of the desert visually more than she probably did in reality. There was this sort of slight fantastical element to it, and I was very wary of that, having come from Game of Thrones . I didn’t want people to think, Oh, well, she only ever does fantasy. It was quite difficult to do because in some ways you want it to be correct, but at the same time you’re working for Werner Herzog, who’s this other type of director, and you sort of go with him and you understand what he’s trying to say. So it was a balance. It wasn’t just pure period film.\nWhat was it that you most wanted to convey about her spirit through her costumes?\nKidman and James Franco.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Benaroya Pictures\nTo show that she was an incredibly strong person, so it was based in some ways on the male costumes as opposed to the female costumes. It had to be incredibly practical yet beautiful. [Gertrude] always wore her hair tied up in this lovely head wrap. We actually also did a lot of our colors once we got to the desert, because you can do colors in the English light or the American light or wherever. But when you get to Morocco and Africa, colors change incredibly, so we were very precise about the mauve of her head wrap, the way it worked with the colors of the sand in that light, and the color—even though she wears a white costume, I wanted it to be bone white, as if something’s been bleached by the sun. And she always wore flat, strong boots. There had to be a strength to it, and the practicality, but at the same time a sense of romance. She fell in love with the desert, she fell in love with the Bedouin, she had love affairs and such. It was the way that she embraced this and the whole idea of the Sahara and the people she met at that time.\nWhat are the practical considerations for you as a costume designer when you are shooting in the desert for three months?\nIt’s imperative that you have local people working for you who know how to get things and find things and make things and can drive there, because obviously driving there is very different from where we drive in Europe and America. And just being able to be very hands-on. You can’t be a designer who sits back and lets everyone else do it, you have to get in there and make and help and dye. The other thing is, if you have to go into the bazaar to buy things, you have to take someone local with you, because [as a tourist] you’ll pay three, four, five, six times the price of anything else. So we have this wonderful system where I’ll just go in, very surreptitiously point at something, and then I’ll leave, and my Moroccan assistant will go and actually buy it. I would work there all the time if I could, frankly. And once you get up into the Atlas Mountains, it’s just magical and the people are so kind and so accommodating, and you create things you couldn’t possibly create anywhere else.\nYou’ve worked with Nicole Kidman previously. Was she hands-on when it came to her costumes? Did she have an interest in that sort of thing?\nShe’s been an actress for many years, and she embodies things. She’s very aware of what doesn’t suit her and what does suit her, and she likes things to be very quickly done. She’s a very strong, very funny person, and I love it. “We’re going to do this now.” You go, “Now?” “Yes, now.” So you just learn how to be. And she’s often very right—“But this isn’t working.” You go, “Really?” And [then] you go, “Oh, yeah, OK, I see.” She understands costumes, she knows how they work. We had a really good rapport with each other, and it was nice to come to the film having already worked with her. She’ll change her body to fit a costume, which is incredible, and I still don’t know quite how she does it. But if she sees something, you know next time you fit her, it will be the shape that you want it to be. It’s really odd. I mean, “But your waist was 26 1/2 inches and now how can it be 24 1/2 [in a period corset]?” “Because I knew it needed to be…” She eats and everything, but she can just become the person you need her to be. And she does wear things beautifully, which really helps.\nPhoto: Courtesy of Benaroya Pictures", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php"], "published": "2015-08-01T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:48:22.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
