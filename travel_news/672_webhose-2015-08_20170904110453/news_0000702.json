Heathrow want to increase this to 3.5 degrees and so from September 14 will trial an angle approach of 3.2 degrees. \nThe trial has been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority and will run until March 2016. While the trial is optional, a large number of airlines that have the necessary standard of navigational equipment for this approach are expected to take part. \nHeathrow director of sustainability and environment Matt Gorman said: “Heathrow has changed, and taken a new approach to addressing our impacts on communities, including when it comes to noise. Our Blueprint to cut aircraft noise have been driven by feedback from local communities. It role is to challenge the industry to think innovatively about ways to reduce noise. \n“Steeper approaches are just one step in the right direction, and along with other quieter operating procedures and incentives to bring quieter aircraft into operation, will ensure fewer people are affected by noise, even with an expanded airport.” \nLast month , the Airports Commission backs third runway at Heathrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T12:46:12.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
