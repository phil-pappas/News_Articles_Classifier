The not for profit, business led organisation has pledged £60,000 towards a series of events including Leeds Big Sleepover - the city’s largest familiarisation trip which takes place from 8-10 October 2015, primed to boost business tourism for the city. \nThe event was first delivered in 2013, when it was attended by over 150 key corporates, associations, agents, travel trade and event organisers staying at over 30 hotels across Leeds, making it the city’s largest ever event of its kind. This year LHVA is working alongside the newly launched ConferenceLeeds with the support of Leeds Business Improvement District to deliver the free biennial event. This year’s Leeds Big Sleepover will focus on the unusual event spaces that the city has to offer including the Leeds Art Gallery, fd Arena, The Tetley, Northern Ballet, Leeds United and the Royal Armouries Museum. Gordon Jackson, Chairman of LHVA and General Manager of Thorpe Park Hotel & Spa commented: “We are delighted to be working alongside the Leeds BID to boost the city’s business and economy, and are tremendously thankful for their investment in our hosted buyer programme. The event in 2013 was such a success, and we are hopeful that with the BID’s assistance, it will be even better this time around.” Leeds BID was announced on 27 February 2015 following a successful ballot and over the next five years has been established for an initial 5 year period until 2020, during which time they will invest £12 million into the city centre as it works to make it a cleaner, brighter place with more events, marketing and promotion and a more vibrant evening economy. Andrew Cooper, the new Chief Executive of Leeds BID said: “Supporting business tourism and conferences was a key priority identified by the business community. We are delighted to be backing this, one our first initiatives to be given financial support. The meeting and conference sector business coming into the city is a major economic driver. I have been overwhelmed by the number and variety of venues that we have in the city that can host major events and conferences. The Leeds Big Sleepover is a great opportunity to bring potential buyers to experience these facilities for themselves and we are pleased that the Leeds BID has been able to make this possible.”Pictured: Andrew Cooper, new Chief Executive of Leeds BID with Jennifer Young Associate Director of Visitor Economy at Leeds City Council and Gordon Jackson, Chairman of Leeds Hotels & Venues Association Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T13:35:15.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
