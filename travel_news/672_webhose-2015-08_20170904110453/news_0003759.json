PUBLISHED: 10:27, Sun, Aug 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:59, Sun, Aug 16, 2015 ALAMY Brighton beach \nIt is not too hard to imagine the man who wrote the dictionary reluctantly hurling his gangly frame into the waters in front of me. \nOf course it is unlikely that Dr Samuel Johnson had the urban seaside soundtrack of carousels and ice-cream van melodies anywhere near him when he forced himself into Brighton’s choppy waters in the late 18th century. \nEven on a bright summer’s day with clouds skidding across the East Sussex skies, inching a couple of toes into the slurping tide was enough for me. \nThe chill factor is considerable. Following in Dr Johnson’s footsteps I headed into the warren of back streets with its Georgian town houses and bohemian taverns that have been frequented by some of the country’s greatest literary talents. \nI joined guide Jacky, from Brighton Walks, a service that celebrates the stellar roll call of authors who fell in love with (or in Dr Johnson’s case, rather disliked) the unique charms of what was, even back in Victorian Britain, one of the country’s premier seaside destinations. \nThe place was, and in some ways still is, a prime source of inspiration and decadence for authors, philosophers, free thinkers and idlers. GETTY The Cricketers, one of Brighton's oldest pubs To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel. Followed by a weekend at the Metropole TS Eliot \nWalking along the seafront, the steep bank of pebbled beach piled below us, we pass the dark-red brick wedding-cake frontage of the Metropole Hotel, mentioned by TS Eliot in his epic poem The Waste Land when Mr Eugenides intones, “To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel. Followed by a weekend at the Metropole”. \nEliot’s deft use of Brighton as a location for some of the grittier episodes in his masterpiece had precedents even then. Farther down the street sits the imposing Regency-style Royal Albion Hotel, scene of a particularly unpleasant chapter in the downfall of Oscar Wilde. \nThis was where the police found the somewhat outrageous author after he engaged in a tryst with a young man on the seafront. \nIt was a charge that was one of many used against him in the famous trial that led to him being confined to a cell in Reading Gaol. GETTY Pretty rural houses in Rottingdean \nHowever, it is in the heart of The Lanes, an engaging and bustling area of narrow streets just off the seafront, that perhaps Brighton’s greatest literary connection comes vividly to life. \nIt was here, back in the late 1930s, that Graham Greene spent time in the town’s pubs creating the characters that would form the world of Brighton Rock, famously taken to the silver screen in 1947 with Richard Attenborough as the gang leader Pinkie Brown. \nThe Cricketers, a stout, whitewashed building, has a Greene Room upstairs featuring framed letters penned by the mysterious author who notoriously never gave interviews. \nThis was his favourite pub in Brighton, according to Jacky, although the famous scene where we meet Pinkie at the start of the story is almost certainly set in the Star and Garter which still exists though it is now called Dr Brighton’s. \nGreene may have depicted the town as flyblown but the man himself appeared to adore the place, once writing, “no city before the war had such a hold on my affections”. \nSipping a pint in Dr Brighton’s I was fast becoming a convert myself to the atmosphere that still treads a fine line between plush bohemian hotel and bedraggled fruit machine arcade. \nCatching a taxi to head two miles along the seafront we arrived at the pretty village of Rottingdean. \nA game of croquet was taking place on the village green and an Irish setter bounded after a tennis ball outside a pub festooned with hanging baskets. The smell of freshly-cut grass made this the quintessential English rural scene that I thought existed only in the fantasies of George Orwell or John Major.

Or were the canoodling couple in a shelter Pinkie and Rose from Brighton Rock? In the words of Mrs Pipchin in Dombey And Son, the novel that Dickens wrote much of while staying here, “Brighton has proved beneficial. Very beneficial indeed”. \nGetting there: Hilton Brighton Metropole (01273 775432/hilton.com/brighton) offers doubles from £90, room only.
