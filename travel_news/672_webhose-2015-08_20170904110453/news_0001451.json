One way to achieve this objective is to make better use of IT resources to improve and enhance the delivery of services internally and to the public. As part of this trend, councils are starting to consider new approaches that can minimise ongoing operating costs, reduce carbon emissions and support mobile working. Virtual desktop infrastructure In a bid to get more from its IT infrastructure, Bath & North East Somerset Council started to examine the possibility of deploying a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) as part of a wide-ranging cost-reduction programme. The objective was to deliver a consistent, high-performance centralised desktop environment across all its sites and to enable employees to work productively from any office or from home. VDI would also allow employees to work more effectively in the community by connecting them remotely to its systems using tablet devices. But in order to make their VDI implementation work with its existing storage area network (SAN), and to meet the storage capacity for two data centres and more than 30 terabytes of data in a virtualised environment, the council faced the prospect of spending a prohibitive amount of money to buy 250 new disks. The Atlantis solution The council looked at Atlantis Computing’s software-defined storage (SDS) solution* to overcome the council’s difficulties. Not only was the Atlantis solution scalable and flexible, it also promised to deliver year-on-year savings. The council decided to deploy the Atlantis software to underpin the virtual desktops being installed at its new administrative headquarters and across five other main offices and 70 remote sites. Atlantis technology is the perfect solution to underpin the council’s services while reducing long-term costs Using the scalable solution allows the council to run 1,500 concurrent virtual desktops with its existing attached storage, saving on the cost of the 250 disks required by the SAN. In addition to faster-than-PC performance, near-instant application launch and super-fast login times, the solution has saved the council more than 100 hours a year in storage management time. Having lowered the organisation’s carbon footprint because of the reduced power and cooling requirements, it has also enabled the council to start replacing its PCs, which consume 200-300 watts, with 7 to 11-watt thin clients that are cheaper to purchase and run. Storage savings Overall, Atlantis Computing has delivered savings of 50pc compared with traditional storage, and reduced the council’s entire projected storage capital expenditure. Leighton Ballard, IT projects manager at Bath & North East Somerset Council, says: “We are really proud of what we have achieved here. VDI will help the council operate more cost-effectively and deliver more efficient services for citizens.” David Cumberworth, vice president of sales EMEA, Atlantis Computing says: “Bath & North East Somerset Council has transformed its IT goals. \"The organisation has a consistent high-performance desktop environment across all its sites, which enables employees to work productively from any office, from home and out in the field. \"Atlantis technology is the perfect solution to underpin the council’s services while reducing long-term costs and simplifying the management of the storage infrastructure.” Analyst firm IDC believes the storage industry is changing. In a 2015 regport it concluded: “Industry trends such as server-based computing that leverages direct-attached storage (DAS), including hyperconverged architectures, the high growth rate of the Software-Defined Storage (SDS) market, and an ability to accommodate the heterogeneity of third platform computing environments will push enterprises of all sizes to evaluate the value that Atlantis brings to the table.” Read the full IDC report here For more information, visit www.atlantiscomputing.com , call +44 203 6429080 or email connect@atlantiscomputing.com Follow @atlantissds *Bath & Somerset case study: https://portal.atlantiscomputing.com/documents/case-studies/Atlantis_CS_BNE-Somerset-Council.aspx", "external_links": ["https://portal.atlantiscomputing.com/documents/case-studies/Atlantis_CS_BNE-Somerset-Council.aspx"], "published": "2015-08-06T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:08:59.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
