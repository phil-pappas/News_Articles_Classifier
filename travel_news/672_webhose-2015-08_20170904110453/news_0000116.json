The hotel brand, the centrepiece of the ONYX Hospitality Group portfolio, has been included in the category of Best Mid-Scale Hotel Group at the prestigious Awards. \nAmari is one of Thailand’s leading locally owned hotel and resort groups, with a network of properties in scenic seaside and city destinations across Thailand and beyond. Amari has introduced travellers from all corners of the world to the warmth of Asian hospitality for nearly three decades. To date there are 11 properties across Thailand, one in Doha, Qatar and one in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Award winners will be determined by the consumer, who has until 30 September to cast their vote, with the winners announced at the BTA Gala Awards Dinner, being held in London on 25 November 2015. Peter Henley, CEO and President of ONYX Hospitality Group, commented: “We are delighted that our Amari brand has been included in the nominations for The British Travel Awards. The last 12 months have seen a lot of progression for the brand, with the opening of Amari Dhaka in Bangladesh and Amari Phuket, which celebrated its 30th anniversary last year, opening the brand new ‘Ocean Wing’ this summer, adding 148 one and two bedroom suites and bringing a new product to market. The Awards are a symbol of excellence when it comes to finding out who really is the best in the business and as a result of a busy and exciting year we are delighted to be recognised as part of the Best Mid-Scale Hotel Group Category.” British Travel Awards’ chief executive Lorraine Barnes Burton said: “The British Travel Awards are the largest consumer voted programme in the UK. Last year more than 1.25 million votes were cast to determine the winners and to receive a BTA is a true accolade.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T17:37:51.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
