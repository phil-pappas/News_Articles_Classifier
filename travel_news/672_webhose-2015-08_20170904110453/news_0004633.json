The racing is organised by the Classic Racing Motorcycle Club (CRMC), with the emphasis on thoroughbred Grand Prix machines. This weekend's Donington Classic Motorcycle Festival features an appearance by local legend \"Rocket\" Ron Haslam. Haslam won three world titles and four British championships, and also competed in Grand Prix motorcycle racing between 1977 and 1993. He joins other bike-racing heros including Freddie Spencer, Niall Mackenzie, Jim Redman and Steve Parrish. Alongside the racing there will be a variety of on-track demonstrations of classic two-wheelers, as well as static displays. The Vintage Japanese Motorcycle Club will once again be holding a show in the Exhibition Centre. Full details can be found here.
