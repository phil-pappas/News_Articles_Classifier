The WestJet Professional Pilots Association group said on its Facebook page that 1,247 pilots voted, and 55 percent voted no, while 45 percent voted yes.\nPilots at most major airlines in Canada and the United States are union members. WestJet, founded in 1996, is one exception.\nThe airline has had relatively cordial relations with its workers, and boasts about its \"friendly WestJetters\" and its employee share purchase plan, calling its workers \"owners.\"\nBut in recent years there have been some signs of discord, including union drives among both pilots and flight attendants.\nWestJet has negotiated agreements with associations that represent pilots and flight attendants, and given employees a chance to vote on those agreements, but because the associations are not unions, their power is limited - for example, they cannot strike.\nIn November 2013, WestJet pilots voted down a tentative agreement endorsed by the WestJet Pilots' Association, a separate pilots' group backed by management. Management and the association went back to the table and workers approved a new agreement in December 2014.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:03:47.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
