Through the card, all arrangements to do with the pregnancy and childbirth will be made free. I was very surprised that there were not so many run-ins with the authorities.’ \nAnother poster, Jantarsan, agreed, adding: ‘Our baby was born in Slovakia and everywhere the European (the blue) card was enough.’ \nA Romanian blogger called Stella writes: ‘This [EHIC] card you can get easy and fast, and most importantly, free. To get it, you need to fill an online form which does not last more than five minutes. \n‘Once the online application has been accepted and received your confirmation email, you are insured! The card you receive by mail about a week. Et voila! Free medical insurance for vacation in Europe!’ \nForums advise Eastern Europeans on how to get round the requirement to show a GP receptionist a ‘proof of address’ document. ‘Tell your friends to make you proof of address,’ writes Iubitulondrei. ‘Write that you live with them. It will be OK.’ \nOthers suggest setting up UK bank accounts registered to a UK address. \nOne man even boasted that he got one by giving police a false address when he was caught shoplifting in Britain. Because the fake address then appeared on an official document, he was able to use it to get an NHS number. \nSome forum users appeal to others for help. Luckaro asks: ‘I worked in the UK for a year as a chambermaid. I am 21 and I got pregnant. I am thinking about giving birth in Slovakia, but only on the condition that I’ll still get all of what I am entitled to here (maternity pay. Child tax credit, child benefit). How do I apply for the European cards?’ \nAnd a woman named Ludecka says: ‘I work in the UK and I’m 13 weeks pregnant. I wondered what would be best, give birth here or at home? I wonder how “to screw with the system”?’ \nIvanka replies: ‘You need to explain why you go (I reported a strong family and personal reason).’ \nAnd Kobercek added: ‘I’ve been in this situation before. No one even blinked. Everything was solved with the EHIC card.’ \nOn Polish forums, members discuss how the EHIC can be used for superficial treatments. \nMehow writes: ‘Having the card entitles people in Poland to primary health care, which includes gynecologist and obstetrician, dentist, dermatologist, venereologist, oncologist, ophthalmologist, a psychiatrist.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:33:49.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
