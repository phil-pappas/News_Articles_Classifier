Already demand is high, with eager weekenders prepared to pay between US$100 (NZ$151.8) and US$160 a night to escape Gaza's privations. \nPhoto: Reuters \nAt night, in contrast to the power cuts that afflict much of the enclave, the resort's lights can be seen glittering around the swimming pool, the terrace and down to the 750-metre private beach, where the surf rolls in gently. \nThe hotel's Facebook page has already received 19,000 Likes and secured 4.7 out of 5 stars from 230 reviewers. \nThe Trip Advisor website is slightly less upbeat, however, featuring a red banner above a picture of the swimming pool reading \"TRAVEL ALERT: SAFETY AND SECURITY CONCERNS\". \nPhoto: Reuters \nOASIS AMID HARDSHIP \nWhile Gaza is one of the world's most economically distraught places, with unemployment at 45 per cent and output contracting 15 per cent last year, there remain pockets of wealth among the 1.8 million population. \nThe war, the third conflict in the territory since 2008, destroyed more than 12,000 homes and left tens of thousands of people homeless. But amid the destruction, and the death of more than 2,000 people, there is a desire among those who can afford it to experience everyday pleasures if possible. \nThere are a number of smart restaurants and hotels on the beachfront in the northern part of Gaza City, sitting almost alongside a refugee camp and not far from neighbourhoods that were heavily bombarded during the war. \nPhoto: Reuters \nTo the frustration of Gazans, post-war reconstruction has only just begun - the first of the destroyed homes were only rebuilt this month. Housing minister Mufeed Al-Hassayna has promised that the pace will now accelerate. \nQatar, a major financial supporter of the Palestinians, has promised US$1 billion in aid, including the rebuilding of 1,000 homes. It has also just completed a new beachfront road. \nGuests at the Blue Beach Resort were full of admiration for the development, even if they were well aware that it is an isolated jewel that many cannot afford. \n\"Since we can't take our families to resorts outside Gaza, we bring them here,\" said Ahmed Khaled, 45, a father of five. \"It's a place where you see only beauty, you can enjoy a drink or lunch by the sea,\" he said. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:22:00.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
