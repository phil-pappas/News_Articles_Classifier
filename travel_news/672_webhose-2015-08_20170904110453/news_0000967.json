(AP) -- The Transportation Security Administration is moving its headquarters to Alexandria. The relocation announced Wednesday by federal and city officials means that 3,400 jobs will move from the Pentagon City section of Arlington County. An additional 400 TSA jobs at other northern Virginia locations will be consolidated at the new headquarters. Alexandria says the new location will be a vacant office building near the Van Dorn Street Metro station, on the city's west end. The move is scheduled for 2017. The city lured TSA in part by offering to create a special tax district that will provide $23 million in tax savings over the course of a 15-year lease. The 3,800 jobs represent more than a 4 percent increase in the city's workforce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:28:28.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
