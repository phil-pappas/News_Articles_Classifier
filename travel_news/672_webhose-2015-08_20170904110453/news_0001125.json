Credit: flickr.com/ Helmuts Guigo \nTwo pilots and two crew members were pulled off a flight after breathalyser tests showed that they were over the legal alcohol limit. \nThe incident occurred last week on a Greece-bound airBaltic flight departing from Oslo with 109 passengers on board. \nThe pilot, co-pilot and two crew members were taken into police custody. They were later taken to hospital for blood tests. \n\"Results of the breathalyser tests confirmed that four of the five crew members ... were above the legal alcohol limit,\" Romerike police prosecutor Edith Ek Sorensen told news.com.au . \nThe Latvian airline has issued an apology for the incident, which resulted in the flight being delayed by almost five hours. \nThe airline also said it has tightened safety measures, increasing the number of breathalyser tests conducted on personnel. \nIt has also introduced pre-duty breathalyser tests for all safety-critical personnel. \nThe four crew members who were removed from the Oslo-Chania flight have been suspended. \nThe airline is also \"preparing for their dismissal due to the damage caused\". \nAccording to news.com.au, the four crew members could face up to two years in prison if found guilty.
