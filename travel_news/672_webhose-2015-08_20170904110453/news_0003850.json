Between October 14 and 25, guests can experience Munich’s famed festival in the truest sense at The Vista II of MGM MACAU.\nThis 12-day beerfest captures the essence of Bavarian festivities through authentic German beer, live entertainment and a party atmosphere. Furnished with classic long wooden tables and benches under a huge tent, the venue comes alive every day from 6pm till midnight, with the clinking of beer mugs and the sounds of traditional accordion and oompah music. Ceiling wreaths and buntings, taps flowing with Spaten beer, carnival game booths, folk dancing and sing-alongs are all part of the fun. Enjoy the rhythmic Bavarian whip-cracking, the playing of traditional Alpenhorn, and kick up your heels with the Högl Fun Band, flown in all the way from Germany. Featuring sexy beer maids in dirndls, MGM MACAU Oktoberfest offers experiences that reflect exactly what you would find in Munich.\nOver the years, MGM MACAU has already received more than 77,000 guests and has served 74,166 liters of beer, 15,895 kilograms of pork knuckles, 6,996 roasted chickens and 9,485 pieces of homemade pretzels; yet this year’s Oktoberfest promises to be bigger, better and wilder than ever!\nBeer is the essence of the Oktoberfest, and MGM MACAU has specially brought one of only six brews that is regarded as the genuine Oktoberfest beer – the Spaten from Munich. First served at 1872’s Oktoberfest, the beer features a rich, textured palate with an underlying sweetness that is true to tradition. Besides Spaten, this year’s Oktoberfest also features Franziskaner Non-alcoholic Beer, Franziskaner Wheat Beer and Fruit Flavor Beer. For 12 knee-slapping days, guests can feast on bratwurst sausages, roasted free range chicken, roasted pork knuckles and other German specialties while enjoying a stein or two of the beer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:11:30.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
