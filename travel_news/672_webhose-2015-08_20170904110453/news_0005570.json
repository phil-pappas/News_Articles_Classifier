His mother died of breast cancer. In an interview with The New York Times in 2007, Carter ruminated on why so many in his family had suffered from the disease.\n“I’m deeply religious, I’m a fatalist, I’m 82 years old and I’ve had a good life,” he said then. In a recent interview on PBS NewsHour, he said his family members all smoked cigarettes but he never did, suggesting that might have been a “triggering device” for genetic causes of the disease in them.\n© 2015 , The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T07:44:20.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
