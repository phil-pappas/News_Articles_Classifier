This is one of the principal conclusions from a survey led by Kayak.fr, the travel search engine, that was published Thursday, August 13.\nIn the middle of the summer vacation period, airports are constantly overflowing. This fact is confirmed by Kayak.fr, which scrutinized the comings and goings of medium and long haul flights. Certain airlines operate flights to \"sunshine destinations\" only during the summer, so it's no surprise that July and August are the busiest months for airports.\nConversely, April is the least packed, ahead of May and February. The travel search engine indicates that this is generally true of all of Europe, with the exception of Spain, where the calmest period is in May.\nBest timing for travelers\nIf they heed Kayak's conclusions, consumers will opt to travel at the beginning of the month, ideally in the second week, with a preference for Tuesdays and Wednesdays. These two days of the week are the quietest ones for airports.\nThose who have a serious problem with crowds should avoid Sunday departures as well as, to a lesser extent, Saturdays and the last week of the month.\nÂ© Provided by AFPRelaxNews Best to travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to avoid crowded airports.
