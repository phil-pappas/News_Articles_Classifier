The increase in the standard rate to $89 from $83 is a step in the right direction,” said Katherine Lugar, president and CEO of AH&LA.\n“We also commend GSA for working closely with the travel and lodging industries to make an important change in its policy to now review the standard continental United States (CONUS) rate every year instead of every three years. This significant shift will ensure that rates align with economic conditions while also providing value for government travelers. We look forward to collaborating closely with the GSA and others to ensure that government travel rates remain fair to taxpayers, government workers and the travel industry.”\nSource: AH&LA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:07:44.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
