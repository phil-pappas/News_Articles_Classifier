As of June 2015, exports to China accounted for 9.6% and 7.8% of SA’s and Russia’s total exports, respectively,\" Mr Montalto said.\nAt 12pm, the all share was down 0.36% to 50,566.60 points and the blue-chip top 40 index had shed 0.41%.\nThe platinum index led the declines, falling 1.11% and the resource index trailed closely behind falling 1.07%. The bank index was down 0.91% while the gold index surged 5.22%.\nEuropean markets were also lower at midday.\nThe FTSE 100 was down 0.51%, the CAC 40 was 0.3% weaker and the Dax 30 was flat.\nAmong individual shares on the JSE, Anglo American was down 1.87% to R149.27 and Kumba Iron Ore fell 3.24% to R89.99.\nIn gold shares, AngloGold Ashanti was up 5.07% to R88.34. Gold Fields rallied 8% to R37.40.\nPlatinum miner Lonmin was down 4.07% to R6.83.\nConstruction company Aveng fell 5.47% to R4.84. SA’s largest construction firm on Tuesday said prospects for business in its key markets in the short term were not promising and‚ as a result‚ the company would focus its attention on the recovery of underperforming businesses and preserving its balance sheet. Aveng reported a diluted headline loss per share for the year ended June 2015 of 189c from headline earnings per share of 26c in the year-earlier period.\nCashbuild was up 3.46% to R321.30.\nThe Anchor Group added 3.32% to R13.69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:47:53.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
