Other passengers were also then removed from the plane, CityAM said. \nEasyJet confirmed that police boarded flight EZY831, bound for Belfast, this morning due to “a passenger behaving disruptively”. \n“While such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously [and] do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour onboard, and always push for prosecution,” the airline tweeted this morning. \n“The safety of passengers and crew is always EasyJet’s priority.” \nSussex Police said in a statement: “A man is in police custody after being tasered on an aircraft waiting to depart from Gatwick Airport to Belfast on Thursday morning. \n“Police officers were called to the EasyJet flight shortly after 8am to reports of a passenger who was becoming increasingly abusive following a dispute over luggage. \n“A man has been arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace. The aircraft has been disembarked and police are taking statements from witnesses among the crew and passengers.”e Readers' comments (3) Anonymous | Thu, 20 Aug 2015 12:20 pm \nHadn't read the new guidelines on the withdrawal of the \"Guaranteed 50x40x20 second bag\" then? Unsuitable or offensive?

If he was allowed to board, I can see why he would think he could take two bags, tasering does seem somewhat excessive and potentially very dangerous in the confines of a packed plane Unsuitable or offensive?
