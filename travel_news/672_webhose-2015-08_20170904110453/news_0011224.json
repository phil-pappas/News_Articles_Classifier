Photographer's Note \nThe Largo da Ordem (Order Square) is a nice place to see architecture since it have many different kind of old buildings. The most curious building here in this photo is the Independent Presbyterian Church centered in the middle of the photo.I don't find any information about it architecture only that was built in 1943, being the first presbyterian church of Curitiba. But the tower is very attractive and can be seen from many places of Order Square. On the right side it is the Wolf Mansion rich for that history. The palace was built by the Austrian immigrant Fredolin Wolf in 1880. It has eclectic architecture, highlighting the Germanic influence and neoclassical standards. Wolf built the building in order to carry out social events. One of the main events was a party held on 21 April 1877, the year it celebrated the installation of the Masonic Lodge Concord IV. The Wolf was owner of the property until 1889, the year the site became the headquarters of the 5th District of the Brazilian Army for six years during the Federalist Revolt. Between 1912 and 1913, the mansion hosted the Town Hall and the following year, the top floor was occupied by the Masonic Lodge of Curitiba. At that time, the Bianchi family took up residence on the ground floor, with private school of painting and violin, occupying the property for 42 years. The site also ran the bookstore Otto Braun (1940). Nowadays, the Wolf Palace, is a space dedicated to literature and reading. It is home of the Reading House Dario Vellozo and Theatre Pia, and rooms that are used for creative writing workshops, seminars, literature courses and training readers.
