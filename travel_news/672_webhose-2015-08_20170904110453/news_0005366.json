Having all of you here in Seychelles is the right step forward,” Minister St.Ange said. \n\"One decision taken is that this East3Route body needs to have more action taken, and with this we are really moving in the right direction. The unity between the four of us stands stronger than ever, and we all have this vision of seeing tourism benefiting our four countries,” Minister St.Ange said. \nThe Creole buffet served at Cerf Island Resort restaurant which overlooks the vast ocean, was prepared by Chef Diolan Barra and his Sous-chef Lee. \nPrior to the lunch, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Seychelles Chamber of Commerce and Industry with KwaZulu-Natal and a second one with Swaziland. \nThe agreement is aimed at setting opportunities for commercial exchanges between these countries, and all representatives of the member countries were present to witness the signing. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
