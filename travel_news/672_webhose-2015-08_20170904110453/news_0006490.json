Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 21, 2015 eTN   \nThe poor condition of the runway at Mbuji Mayi Airport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has led to some damage to Korongo Airline’s Boeing B737 during takeoff when loose tarmac slabs damaged a stabilizer, effectively grounding the aircraft until repairs are carried out. \nNo passengers came to any harm but the subsequent flights had to be cancelled, effective immediately and until at least August 26. \nPassengers booked on flights between the airline’s base in Lubumbashi to Johannesburg, Kinshasa, and the culprit airport Mbuji Mayi have been offered a full refund of their tickets or else a free rebooking for flights when services resume. Korongo presently is the only airline in Congo compliant with the EU’s EASA safety regulations and operates a single Boeing B737. The airline is a partnership between Brussels Airlines and local Congolese investors keen on quality services and safe operations. \nCommunication received from the airline’s Corporate Communications Department expressed sincere regrets for the situation which, going by the reasons explained, was entirely beyond their control. \nMbuji Mayi airport management was immediately informed of the damage sustained by the aircraft and immediate demands were made to repair the runway or else face a boycott by airlines flying there until the situation is remedied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T23:36:12.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
