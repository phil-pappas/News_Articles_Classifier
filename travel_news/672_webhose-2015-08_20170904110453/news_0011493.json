The United States continues to be our biggest international market for inbound tourism but there is always room for growth. Direct route improvements over the last two years have helped boost visitor numbers and this new route will tap in to Delta’s vast North American network opening up even more opportunities for US visitors to come to Scotland.\n“Connecting Scotland to major hubs in the US is key for growth and with this new route we now have all three major airline alliances serving Edinburgh and Scotland which will encourage visitors, including those members of airline loyalty schemes, to fly directly to the country.\n“US visitors are drawn to Scotland for its awe-inspiring scenery, engrossing history and rich culture, while the enduring appeal of Diana Gabaldon’s ‘Outlander’ continues to generated huge interest amongst travellers.”\nSource:- Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T07:56:05.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
