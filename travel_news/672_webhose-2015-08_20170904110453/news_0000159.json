Home to two City Livery Companies: The Worshipful Company of Farmers and The Worshipful Company of Fletchers, Farmers & Fletchers In the City is located at 3 Cloth Street, London EC1A 7LD. \nOn the day, The Princess Royal will be meeting the Court of the Farmers and the Court of the Fletchers, as well as the designers of the venue. The Princess Royal, who runs her own farm in Gloucestershire and has over 40 years’ farming experience originally opened the Hall in 1987, and was Master of The Worshipful Company of Farmers from 2001-2002. The Princess Royal has also been Honorary Assistant for the Worshipful Company of Farmers since 2002. The Worshipful Company of Farmers was originally founded in 1952. Agriculture can be said to be England's oldest and most important industry, with the growth of the City dependent on the supply of food to support its growing population for centuries. Farmers & Fletchers In the City is dedicated to food provenance and their tailor-made menus will support ‘forgotten foods’ such as native rabbit and Lancashire venison. Surplus profits from Farmers & Fletchers In the City will go to a wide range of charities that help to develop skills in the farming industry – especially in the areas of leadership and management. This commitment will assist in supporting some of the causes that are important to The Princess Royal, such as her passion for involving younger people in farming. Farmers & Fletchers In the City aims to create a 'home from home' for members and families of The Worship Companies of Farmers and Fletchers, as well as providing an elegant and contemporary event space for the wider City community. The building will be available for a range of event bookings, from private dinners, wedding receptions and parties, to meetings, conferences and press launches. The largest room will accommodate up to 120 guests for a dinner. Natural colours such as soft duck egg, soft sage green and soft pebble grey have been used throughout to create a lovely ambience for both business and leisure events.
