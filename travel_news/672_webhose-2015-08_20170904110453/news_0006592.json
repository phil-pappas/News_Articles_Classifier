Prosecutors have agreed to seek a sentence no greater than 12 1/2 years, while Fogle agreed not to seek a sentence of less than five years. \nWhen reached by TheStreet , a spokesperson for the privately held Subway replied via email: \"We have already ended our relationship with Jared and have no further comment.\" Subway's minimal comment on the latest developments was in keeping with how it's dealt with the sensitive situation since news that Fogle was being investigated first came out in early July. Subway has largely said nothing, and instead reiterated that it moved quickly to sever ties with their long-time pitchman as soon as the allegations surfaced. \nSubway franchisees are naturally also distancing themselves from Fogle. \"The charges against Jared Fogle are inexcusable, and in no way represent our wholesome, family-brand values -- we had already ended our relationship with Jared, and are confident that it was the right decision,\" said a spokesperson for Subway's Northern Georgia territory to TheStreet . \nMust Read: Shake Shack Valuation Looks Lofty, but Too Soon to Short \nSubway initially announced on July 8 that it had suspended its relationship with Fogle after state and federal authorities raided his home, two months after Russell Taylor, the former executive director of Fogler's charity for kids, was arrested on child pornography charges. \nAccording to a statement from Subway at the time, both sides agreed that suspending the relationship with Fogle was \"the appropriate step to take.\" The statement added that Fogle was continuing to cooperate with authorities and expected \"no actions forthcoming.\"Now it appears things have taken a turn for the worst for Fogle with his plea admitting to traveling for sex with at least two minors between about 2010 and 2013, and receiving child pornography from Russell Taylor on \"multiple occasions\" between about 2011 and 2015. \nAs a result, an already struggling business may take a turn for the worst. Fogle has appeared in more than 300 commercials for Subway since 2000, with the sandwich chain's rise partly thanks to Fogle's story of losing a massive amount weight by simply eating Subway sandwiches and exercising. \nAccording to research firm Technomic's \" 2015 Top 500 Chain Report ,\" Subway rang up $11.9 billion in U.S. sales in 2014, which represented a 3% decline from the previous year. By comparison, U.S. sales at Chipotle ( CMG - Get Report ) and Dunkin Donuts ( DNKN - Get Report ) increased by 27.8% and 5.3%, respectively, in 2014. \nEven struggling McDonald's ( MCD - Get Report ) outperformed Subway in terms of U.S. sales last year, with a decline of 2.2%. \nAccording to The Wall Street Journal (paywall), profitability at Subway stores is down and the chain is slowing its expansion plans in the U.S., where it currently has about 27,000 locations. Coinciding with the sales decline have been surveys showing slightly declining satisfaction on the part of customers. According to new findings from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Subway's customer-satisfaction index in the U.S. stands at 77, a 1.3% decline from the previous year and a 6% fall from three years ago. \nOverall, Subway was ranked seventh in satisfaction among 17 fast-food restaurants measured, behind competitors Panera Bread ( PNRA - Get Report ) , Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, Papa John's ( PZZA - Get Report ) , Chipotle and Chick-Fil-A . \nSubway's sales and customer-satisfaction troubles, prior to the Fogle debacle, may stem from the ingredients it uses to build its meat-filled subs. In a world demanding the use of hormone-free beef from Shake Shack ( SHAK ) and \"real chicken\" from McDonald's , Subway's containers holding mounds of processed cold cuts and cheeses for customers to choose from don't pass muster. \nSubway has made an initial attempt to reverse customer's negative perceptions about the healthiness of the food it serves, announcing it will remove all artificial flavors, colors and preservatives from its North American menu by 2017. But its efforts to enhance its ingredients may fall on deaf ears as consumers shun Subway due to the Fogle situation. Posts about Fogle, including many off-color jokes, were blowing up on social media on Wednesday. \nSeveral other sandwich-focused chains could see a sales lift from Subway's woes, including privately held Arby's . The sandwich chain, which boasts more than 3,300 locations worldwide, is promoting a new \"Loaded Italian\" sub. Other beneficiaries of Subway's troubles could include up-and-coming sandwich shops such as Jersey Mike's Subs and Firehouse Subs .
