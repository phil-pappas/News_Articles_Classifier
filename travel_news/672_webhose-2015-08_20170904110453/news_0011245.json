Move the spatula-shaped tool over skin to produce ultrasonic waves that create a mist of micro particles to clean pores of oil, impurities, blackheads and whiteheads. Unlike rotating brush cleaners, it does not need a replacement brush. It has four levels of intensity to suit all skin types and has a rechargeable battery that lasts for two hours. As you gently glide it over skin, you can visibly see dirt and debris releasing from your skin. Once you have cleansed the skin, flip the device over and use the flat edge to help water-based skin products penetrate better. The Skin Perfecter costs $225 and is available at skinperfecter.com or QVC (where it is was recently priced at $189.)\nExplore the digital extras GET THE COMPLETE STORY The story you're reading is premium content and is available to subscribers on our premium website for free.
