Do you see the landing strip?\nRemember it’s moving. I’ll hit all these switches up here and you steer it in,\" I chatter to my 11-year-old daughter Nadia, \"OK, perfect landing!\"\nNadia’s first simulated landing on an aircraft carrier was memorable. With only about 10 minutes of stick time we were both able to get a glimpse at what it must have felt like to successfully land an airplane on the deck of the USS Midway, a 300-metre-long vessel that was commissioned a week after the end of the Second World War and remained in service until 1992. Nowadays it is a museum ship at the USS Midway Museum, in San Diego, Calif.\nDuring our three-day tour of San Diego, we were treated to a premium family experience loaded with history, nature, beaches and the culinary richness of the region.\nNot far from the USS Midway is San Diego’s Gaslamp Quarter. Comprising more than 16 blocks of the downtown area, Gaslamp is host to nearly 100 restaurants, cafes and bars. Its main period of development began in 1867 and the cobblestone walkways and Victorian-style architecture definitely drift you back in time.\nWe enjoyed a terrific breakfast at Cafe 222 on Island Avenue in the heart of the district. This hip breakfast and lunch joint supremely satisfied our appetite for waffles.\nOur next stop was what every kid screams for on a U.S. holiday — an amusement park, complete with a roller coaster and a haunted house.\nBelmont Park is located on the surf and sand of Mission Beach. The highlight of the park is the Giant Dipper, a historic wooden roller coaster built in 1925 that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Although Nadia was far too wise to try the ancient ride, I did, and can report that people back in 1925 were much smaller. My six-foot-six height on the Giant Dipper made me feel like I was driving a Smart car in a clown festival. Very fun and likely very funny for onlookers. The zip-line was more Nadia’s pace. The haunted house started off great, but quickly turned into a horror show, with Nadia pulling on my sleeve and lamenting, \"Dad, this isn’t fun anymore.\"\nTo recover from the terror, we decided to hit the South Mission Draft brew pub. This bustling hot spot is located right on the beach and offers 60 brands of draft and 50 bottled-beer options.\nI’ve been to some awesome beer houses around the globe and this one fights for top spot in my books. The selection included many local breweries, and the food — especially the pasta — was amazing. The sea breeze off the ocean blew away any of the stress remaining from the haunted house. After lunch, Nadia shed her shoes and socks and headed for the water.\nThere’s a great vibe on Mission Beach and we stayed there for the remainder of the day.\nIn the morning we decided to partake in a boat tour of San Diego Bay. While others may opt for a ferry or even a tour in a catamaran, Nadia and I are a bit more adventurous and signed up for a tour aboard our very own fourmetre- long speed boat. No worries here, I’m an experienced boater and my Boater Safety Card (obtained online) was safely tucked in my wallet. Nadia has also skippered our aluminum fishing boat, so there was no need to worry, right? My Spidey sense, however, started tingling when the enthusiastic tour leader (who was likely not old enough to drink in the state of California), double-checked to ensure we had signed the waiver correctly.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T21:46:08.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
