Enhanced infrastructure outside the South East drives investment which is good news for a more balanced national economy.”\nThe new services will see Arriva invest in a fleet of new Pendolino trains.\nRead our feature on Is there a lack of competition in the British rail industry?\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-10T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T15:11:01.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
