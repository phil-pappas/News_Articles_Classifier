The silence is broken only by the occasional squawks of the egrets and the swish of the farmers in the placid waters of Celebes Sea. Beaming from ear to ear, Joyce claps her hands in excitement. “Everyone warned me about this place. I never imagined I’d be here,” she says. Had we backed out upon hearing about the recent bomb explosions, kidnappings, and beheadings in the infamous provinces in Mindanao, we wouldn’t have seen Omapuy Island, which for us is one of the country’s most beautiful islands. The island, whose wide swathes of powdery white sand glow from afar, is tucked away in Tawi-Tawi, the southernmost province in the country.\nTawi-Tawi shares sea borders with the island of Borneo to the west. It is a peaceful home to several indigenous tribes: the Sama, who comprise a large percentage of the population; the Tausug, a Moro-ethnic group who are dominant politically and economically; the Badjao, the seafaring gypsies; and the Jama Mapun, a group largely found in the isolated Cagayan Mapun and Turtle Island Group.\nSECRET SANCTUARY Omapuy Island\nSitangkai, a bustling municipality in the middle of the sea\nA rubber tree plantation in Basilan\nsea cucumber farming\na putterfish vendor in Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi\nThe floating village in Tawi-tawi\nThe freshest seafood in Tawi-tawi\nThe Philippine MOnkeys in Bud Bongao\nA Tausug seaweed farmer in Omapuy island\nThe Merioquet Falls in Zamboanga\nAn ARMM territory, Tawi-Tawi looks nothing like an island of dread. With bright-eyed enthusiasm, Ate Nursida Jaluddin, a tourism staff at the Sanga-Sanga Airport in Bongao, makes last-minute tour arrangements for us after our original guide bailed out without notice. After a hefty breakfast of satti (grilled chicken and rice drenched in spicy curry sauce), junai(steamed rice mixed with burnt coconut grates and paired with hard-boiled egg), and tiyula-itum(beef stew that is also blackened with burnt coconut grates), we board a lantsa (a large wooden boat) at the bustling Chinese Pier. The pungent smell of marang, durian, and dried fish wafts in the air. The lantsa is brimming not just with passengers but also with huge boxes of goods that can be bought only in Bongao, the province’s economic capital. A four-hour boat ride takes us to the humble town of Sibutu, the jump-off point to the remote islands in our itinerary.\nTHE SURREAL SOUTH\n“Surreal!” We unanimously agree about the feeling of reaching Saluag Island, the southernmost island in the Philippines, just 40 kilometers away from the Malaysian state of Sabah. Its gorgeous transparent waters reveal hectares of luxuriant sea grass and corals.“On a clear day, the mountains of Sabah can be seen from this island,” says Alnour, our guide, as our boat crawls over the coralline reef. Here, the Tausug and the Sama Dilaut, who share the bounties of the sea for livelihood, live peacefully in a small settlement along the white beach. On a typical day, one would find women and children on the shore, sorting out their seaweed harvests before hanging them on wooden poles to dry.\nNot far from Saluag Island is the municipality of Sitangkai, a lively settlement that stands not on land but on reef. Approaching Sitangkai is like entering a different world. It has a one-kilometer marine causeway that is fringed with stores that sell dry wares, fresh produce, and even bizarre merchandise like dried stingrays and puffer fish, which according to a vendor is actually safe to eat. Here, footbridges connect one house to another and pump boats are the only mode of transportation. Traffic usually happens in the morning, when people from nearby islands come to purchase supplies. Many peddlers would crowd the 20-feet wide waterway to sell directly from their boats.\nBesides the unusual trade and commerce, seaweed farming is also another source of livelihood in the island. In fact, Sitangkai is the largest producer of seaweeds in the country.\nHOLY GROUND\nSetting foot in Simunul Island is another surreal experience. “We are standing exactly on the birthplace of Islam in the Philippines,” says our guide.We are speechless with excitement. In 1380 AD, an Arab missionary and trader from Mecca named Sheikh Karim Ul-Makhdumarrived arrived in Simunul Island to preach Islam to our tree-worshiping ancestors, long before the Spaniards came. Today, a mosque named after him stands in Brgy. Tubig-Indangan as an important landmark where the first Islamic temple in the archipelago was built. Inside it are four intricately designed ipil-wood pillars, which are said to be from the original 14th century mosque.\nWhile many believe that the sheik’s remains are interred just within the mosque’s premises, others assert that his real grave is the one enshrined in Barangay Tandubanak in Sibutu. The latter is considered a national heritage site. Both graveyards are revered pilgrimage sites of Filipino Muslims.\n“Say a prayer when you reach the summit, then promise to come back if your wish comes true,” says Lance, our guide to Bud Bongao, the highest peak in Tawi-Tawi. We are unsure if he is serious, until we meet families who hike up just to pray and meditate. Soaring 340 meters above the sea, Bud Bongao (“bud” is Tausug for mountain) dominates Tawi-Tawi’s landscape and is easily recognized from afar due to its distinct U-shape. The trail is clear, and lofty molave, kalantas, and lumbang trees cover our heads from the harsh daylight as we climb. Sweat-drenched, we walk in silence as we near the tampat (shrine) just below the peak, where pilgrims whisper their prayers. We see three holy shrines not far from each other, and according to our guide, one of Sheikh Makhdum’s original followers was buried in the vicinity. Upon reaching the summit, the vast greenery below and the calm glistening waters of the Celebes Sea render us breathless and oblivious of the scorching high-noon sun. Besides being a pilgrimage site, Bud Bongao is also a treasure trove of biodiversity. It is home to the pugad lawin, the orange albatross, monitor lizards, the short-nosed fruit bats, and the philippine monkeys/long-tailed macaques, which we have to please with bread offerings halfway through our descent.\nFORBIDDEN PARADISE\nBefore sunrise the following day, we find ourselves on a plane to Zamboanga City, our jump-off point to a province our mothers vehemently forbade us from visiting—Basilan. The name evokes fear, and admittedly, I associate the place with terrorists and their mutilated victims. Perhaps expecting an occasional gunfire or at least a little tension in the air, we are surprised to find Isabela City, its capital, to be just like any rustic city we’ve been to. Bustling streets and business establishments. Boisterous teenagers on the sidewalk. A crowded Jollibee. “This is our typical day. Contrary to what you see on television, our city is safe,” assures Ate Yanyan Pineda, our vivacious guide from the tourism office. According to her, Mayor Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar is keen on reversing the negative image brought about by the Abu Sayyaf by ensuring tight security at all times.\nBasilan is home to several ethnic groups, such as the Yakan, Tausug, and Badjao, whose stilt villages fringe the Isabela Channel. Though most of these groups thrive on fishing, agriculture is the province’s main source of livelihood. Aside from the typical palay, corn, and coconut, Isabela’s rolling hills are strewn with coffee plants and rubber trees.\nA scenic boat ride along the channel, followed by a quick habal-habal ride, takes us to a secluded slice in Malamawi Island, where a beautiful white beach awaits us. The sand is fine and soft like flour and the water, clean and sparkling. If the province’s notorious reputation has done any good, it has kept Malamawi Island away from irresponsible tourists. There are few cottages for rent, and soon, overnight facilities will be completed. “Aren’t you scared of our province?” asks one of the locals. “Do I have a reason to be scared?” I ask him back. He smiles, and tells me that just like any other place, unfortunate events happen sporadically. “It is generally peaceful here,” he declares. Though pressed for time, we linger a little more. I tell you, the water here is irresistible.\nAte Yanyan then takes us to Cabunbata Falls, a roadside scenery located just seven kilometers from the city center. Concealed by a few mahogany and rubber trees, it is a perfect place to just sit meditatively and listen to the gentle cascade and the whistling of the birds among the lush vegetation.We also drop by the rubber tree plantation and the rubber factory. Embarrassingly, I didn’t know rubbers come from trees. According to a factory attendant, rubber production is a meticulous process. They carefully tap the trees as early as two in the morning because the cool air encourages the latex to flow freely. Rubber is among the major agricultural products of the city.\nLATIN CITY\nSunset finds us back in Zamboanga City, munching on a popular snack called Knickerbocker (fresh fruits with milk and ice cream) at Paseo del Mar, a seafront parkway that is clustered with bars and restaurants. Locals and tourists converge here at dusk to enjoy the view, the fresh air and the good food. Like Tawi-Tawi and Basilan, Zamboanga is unfortunately plagued with a notorious image. Remember the siege two years ago? “Everything is peaceful now as it normally is,” assures Huge, our friend who is a local. The local government’s effort to turn the tide of fear is evident on the presence of police officers in public places.\nWhen you visit this progressive city, don’t be surprised when the least Spanish-looking person inside the jeepney says “Pasahe, por favor!” It doesn’t take a genius to see Spain’s legacy to the Zamboangenos. The Chavacano dialect (a fusion of Spanish and Visayan languages), oldstone houses and the ancient coral walls of Fort Pilar are just a few of the obvious ones. Zamboanga City was once a Spanish settlement and a garrison town that protected Spain’s interest in the region. In 1635, Fort Pilar was built as a defense fortress against the Moro pirates and raiders upon the request of the Jesuit missionaries. An important landmark, it stands today as an outdoor Roman Catholic shrine and a museum.\nOn our last day, we decide to visit the remote Merloquet Falls. Located in the village of Sibulao around 78 kilometers east of the city, the waterfalls is only for those who are willing to endure a two-hour bus ride from the city center, a 30-minute habal-habal ride and a 10-minute trek. Determined, we proceed despite the heavy downpour and the bumpy motorcycle ride. Our exhaustion vanishes when we see the wide and gorgeous cascade draping beautifully on the moss-covered cliff. The falls has an upper tier that is not visible from the ground. Smaller but just as beautiful, it can be accessed by climbing a slippery and difficult trail, with a rope and the trees’ undergrowth as handholds. I sit with my back against the cascade for a while. The natural massage is pure bliss.\nDon’t leave Zamboanga City without visiting the Canelar Trading Center. Inside the open-air shopping mecca are endless rows of colorful and intricately designed malongs, bags, batik dresses, and sarongs. Serious bargain hunters would be delighted to find Malaysian and Indonesian products, from clothes to chocolates, at dirt-cheap prices.\nAdmittedly, I braved these forbidden places for bragging rights, but I end up humbled and educated. While most think that terrorism is an everyday occurrence in the region, we experienced the people’s genuine warmth and their tremendously rich culture. Not everything you hear on the news is true.\nWHO TO CALL:\n1.) Zamboanga City Tourism Office- (062) 992-6242\n2.)
