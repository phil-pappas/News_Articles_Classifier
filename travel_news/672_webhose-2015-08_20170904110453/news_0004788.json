Governments, meanwhile, urge their nationals to be careful. Inside the modern terminal of Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand. Photo Credit: Mattes \n\nAs bombings rock Bangkok, nervous travellers wishing to re-book or re-route their flights might have their fees waved, but it's really up to the individual carrier. And what kind of advice do governments have for their nationals? \nFlights to and from Bangkok have not been affected by the bombings that rocked the city on 17 and 18 August 2015. \nWhether travellers want to be on those flights is another issue. Will they be charged for re-booking or re-routing their flights if they are nervous about visiting Bangkok? \nIt depends on which airline they are flying. Some airlines are more flexible at times like this than others. And some airlines are more upfront about this information than others. \nAt least 6 airlines - Hong Kong Airlines, Jetstar, Scoot, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways International, and Tiger Airways - have stated on their websites that fees WILL be waived through 15 or 18 September. \nSingapore Airlines put this information on a clickable rotating banner just under the header. Hong Kong Airlines put it in a clickable box on the side of the webpage. \nThis information was available on the Thai Airways website, but you had to search for it. I found it in a press release under \"About Thai\", but I'm not sure that the average passenger would think of looking there. \nI really think that airlines should do what Singapore Airlines does - put this kind of information in a banner just under the header. \nHelpful Advice? \nMalaysian Airlines did just that. When I clicked on the banner, I learned that flights to and from Bangkok would operate as scheduled, which was helpful. I'm sure many people would have wanted to know that, and the information was readily available. \nBut the advice to passengers was that they should \"plan their travel time to the airport,\" which seems to imply that fees for re-booking or re-routing flights would not be waved. \nHmmm ... considering the airline's safety record in recent years (2 planes down), you'd think they'd go out of their ways to assuage the fears of nervous flyers! \nA quick review of the websites of several other air carriers serving Bangkok proves less than informative. \nThe landing pages of Air Asia, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Etihad Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Jetstar, Korean Air, Qatar Airways, and United Airlines all fail to make any mention of whether flights are operating as scheduled or if fees will be waved for passengers wanting to re-book or re-route. \nYou would think that information would be front and centre so that passengers wouldn't have to search for it. \nLife Goes On \nAccording to the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), the Thai tourism industry is mobilizing \"the support of its members to assist and facilitate tourists affected by the incident, such as providing interpreters and helping with immediate travel arrangements\". \nOtherwise, life in Bangkok goes on pretty much as usual. Banks, government offices, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and tourist attractions remain open. \nBoth Don Muang Airport and Suvarnabhumi International are operating. Major roads, the BTS Skytrain and MTR are functioning, as well. \n\"The Royal Thai Police have requested that locals and tourists exercise caution when out and about in Bangkok,\" TAT says. \n\"The Police have also increased their presence and put extra security in place at all of Bangkokâ€™s key tourist areas in response to the incident. Citywide patrols are in place to ensure the safety of locals and visitors to the Thai capital.\" \nHere is a roundup of what some foreign governments are advising their citizens ... \nAustralia \nUrging its citizens to \"exercise a high degree of caution\" (the 2nd lowest advisory on a 4 tier scale), the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says there is a \"possibility of civil unrest and the threat of terrorist attack, including in Bangkok and Phuket. The security situation remains volatile. You should pay close attention to your personal security at all times and where possible monitor the local media, including social media, for information about possible new safety or security risks.\" \nBritain \nBritain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office urges its nationals to \"monitor news reports, follow the advice of local authorities, and take extra care.\" \nCanada \nNo nationwide advisory has been issued by the Government of Canada. \"However, you should exercise a high degree of caution due to ongoing political tensions and sporadic demonstrations in Bangkok and elsewhere in the country,\" its website says (the advisory appears to have pre-existed the current crisis). \nHong Kong \nThe Security Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong has issued one of the more strongly worded travel advisories, calling the situation in Bangkok a \"significant threat\" and urging residents of the S.A.R. to \"adjust travel plans and avoid non-essential travel\" to Bangkok. \n\"Residents intending to visit Thailand (Bangkok) should adjust their travel plans and avoid non-essential travel, including leisure travel,\" a spokesman for the bureau says. \n\"Those already there should pay attention to announcements by local authorities, attend to their personal safety and avoid areas affected by the explosion incident.\" \nMalaysia \nThe Malaysian Foreign Ministry has not issued any travel advisory against traveling into Bangkok or other parts of Thailand. The Ministry does, however, advise Malaysians in the country to follow instructions issued by the authorities of Thailand. \nUnited States \nThe United States Department of States urges Americans to review their \"personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings, including local events; and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security and follow instructions of local authorities.\" \nBangkok continues to be one of the world's most popular travel destinations. But judging by the events of recent years, you can't help but wonder how safe the place really is. \nTalking Points \nWould the bombings in Bangkok discourage you from visiting the Thai capital? \nPlease post your comment in the Comment Box below or on Facebook at the following link: Accidental Travel Writer on Facebook .
