The luxury resort has consistently developed its green policies in line with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. GGC is the premier worldwide sustainability stamp for the tourism industry. \nActions taken to improve sustainability performance at the resort have resulted in substantial cost savings. Measures taken include the use of an in-house bottling plant which re-uses glass bottles instead of shipping in bottled water - saving approximately 72,000 plastic bottles per year; the implementation of a sea-water reverse osmosis system which creates fresh drinking water from sea-water and where possible, the resort also uses LED lights in all areas including guest villas and has implemented a low pressure sanitary system in all guest bathrooms. General Manager, David Stepetic, said: “The Jumeirah Dhevanafushi team is proud to have achieved the Green Globe Certification. We’re now into the fourth successful year of operation and have always strived to dedicate ourselves to conservation and sustainability. With this certification, we now must work to achieve more for the environmental conservation and our local community efforts in order to preserve the natural beauty of Meradhoo Island, Jumeirah Dhevanafushi.” In line with the Green Globe values, Jumeirah Dhevanafushi places a high priority on community engagement and culturally connected projects and experiences for both guests and colleagues. This includes monthly reef cleaning activities and educational excursions to visit local islands and learn more about the Maldives, the culture and the local community. Jumeirah Dhevanafushi also hosts, a culturally connected weekly ‘Maldivian Night’ at Mumayaz restaurant that serves local cuisine and provides traditional entertainment.
