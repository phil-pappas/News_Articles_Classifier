Tourism revenue was 818.4 billion baht ($23.30 billion), up 30.6 percent on the year, according to statistics compiled by the ministry provided to Reuters.\nThe government expects a record 30 million tourists this year, generating around 2.2 trillion baht in tourism revenue. The high season is in the second half of the year.\nThe majority of tourists in Thailand are from China. Malaysia and Japan also rank among the biggest sources of visitors in 2015, the ministry says.
