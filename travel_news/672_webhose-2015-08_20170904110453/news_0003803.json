These authentic lands will have two signature attractions, including the ability to take the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, on a customized secret mission, and an epic Star Wars adventure that puts guests in the middle of a climactic battle. (Disney Parks) Ambitious plans to bring Star Wars to life in the two parks include creating Disney's largest single themed land expansions ever at 14 acres each, transporting guests to a never-before-seen planet, a remote trading port and one of the last stops before wild space where Star Wars characters and their stories come to life. \n\"I am thrilled to announce the next chapter in the long and exciting history between Disney Parks and Star Wars,\" said Iger. \"We are creating a jaw-dropping new world that represents our largest single themed land expansion ever. These new lands at Disneyland and Walt Disney World will transport guests to a whole new Star Wars planet, including an epic Star Wars adventure that puts you in the middle of a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance.\" \nThese authentic lands will have two signature attractions. Along with the thrilling battle experience, another attraction puts guests behind the controls of one of the most recognizable ships in the galaxy, the Millennium Falcon, as they take on a customized secret mission. \nIger also shared concept images of the Star Wars-themed lands, giving fans a glimpse at what is to come for Disney parks. \nThe partnership between Disney and Lucasfilm dates back to 1987, when the successful Star Tours attraction, inspired by George Lucas's legendary Star Wars film series, opened at Disneyland. The attraction was then redesigned, emerging as \"Star Tours – The Adventures Continue\" in 2011 and featuring more than 50 different story outcomes and the possibility to visit five different planets. \nFor 60 years, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts has been delighting millions of people with fantastic storytelling, exceptional entertainment and extraordinary experiences, creating places where guests can make life-long memories with their friends and families. This announcement marks an unprecedented time of growth with exciting developments happening around the world – from Disneyland Resort's Diamond Celebration to the anticipated opening of Shanghai Disney Resort in China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T04:17:02.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
