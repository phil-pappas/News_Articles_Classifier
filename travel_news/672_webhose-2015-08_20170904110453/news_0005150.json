The program continues a long-term initiative from BeMyDD to lower the rate of drunk driving deaths and promote social responsibility throughout the markets it serves.\nTogether with partners Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack Rare Tennessee Whiskey and Total Wine & More, BeMyDD will launch The 24-City Designated Driver Tour on September 26 in BeMyDD's hometown of Los Angeles . Over the next year, the tour will bring free designated drivers to a new city every other Saturday, providing car pickup services within 50 miles of the city center. From 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. on the specified date in each location, customers who have driven somewhere and do not want to drive home can request a car pickup at no charge by using the BeMyDD smartphone app, available for iOS and Android devices. A team of drivers will arrive at the customer's location, one to drive the customer and their car home safely, and the other to retrieve the driver afterwards. More information on the program and instructions on receiving free car pickup can be found at www.BeMyDD.com/DDTour .\n\"Social responsibility is a huge priority for us,\" said Arthur Simanovsky , BeMyDD president and CEO. \"We're always looking for ways to make finding a designated driver easier than getting behind the wheel. The 24-City Designated Driver Tour is our biggest opportunity yet to positively impact communities all over the United States .\"\nAccording to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation, a drunk driver kills someone every 52 minutes. Targeted specifically for people in the suburbs, for whom taxi rides downtown can quickly get expensive, BeMyDD aims to give consumers an affordable and safe transportation alternative by using the customer's own vehicle. Fully-screened and insured drivers with over 10 years of driving experience are available on-demand for a variety of driving services, including event transportation and hourly personal drivers. In addition to the potential lives saved through the use of designated drivers, services like BeMyDD also help avoid the expense of getting a DUI, which can cost around $16,000 , according to AAA.\n\"The 24-City Designated Driver Tour is an excellent opportunity to promote responsible consumer enjoyment, which is one of our core brand values,\" said Rob Frederick , Director of Corporate Responsibility at Jack Daniel's parent corporation Brown-Forman. \"This is a unique campaign that has our full support.\"\nLikewise, Matt Indre , Senior Manager of Public Affairs & Corporate Responsibility at Total Wine & More, points out the program's potential for having a positive impact.\n\"We strive to be a responsible corporate citizen and make a difference in our communities through our corporate philanthropy and social responsibility programs,\" he says. \"We are committed to responsible enjoyment of alcohol and the 24-City Designated Driver Tour supports that goal.\"\nThe 24-City Designated Driver Tour schedule is as follows:\nSeptember 26, 2015\nLos Angeles, CA\nOctober 10, 2015\nMiami, FL\nOctober 24, 2015\nOrange County, CA\nNovember 7, 2015\nTampa, FL\nNovember 21, 2015\nCleveland, OH\nDecember 5, 2015\nCharlotte, NC\nDecember 19, 2015\nIndianapolis, IN\nJanuary 9, 2016\nAtlanta, GA\nJanuary 23, 2016\nPhoenix, AZ\nFebruary 6, 2016\nDenver, CO\nFebruary 20, 2016\nMinneapolis, MN\nMarch 5, 2016\nChicago, IL\nMarch 19, 2016\nOrlando, FL\nApril 2, 2016\nDallas/Fort Worth, TX\nApril 16, 2016\nSeattle, WA\nApril 30, 2016\nSan Diego, CA\nMay 14, 2016\nWashington D.C./Baltimore, MD/VA/DC\nMay 28, 2016\nSan Francisco, CA\nJune 11, 2016\nRaleigh-Durham, NC\nJune 25, 2016\nBoston, MA\nJuly 9, 2016\nLas Vegas, NV\nJuly 23, 2016\nHouston, TX\nAugust 6, 2016\nSan Antonio, TX\nAugust 20, 2016\nNew York City, NY/CT/NJ\nFree pickup service will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis.
