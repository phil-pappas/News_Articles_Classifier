But it may only be a matter of time before Wildwood starts charging beachgoers to lay on its long stretches of sand, according to the Press of Atlantic City . The Shore town has added attractions and services, including inflatable slides for kids and food concession stands on the beach, in the past few years and it has plans to add more. Beach concessions raised about $225,000 for Wildwood in 2014, and should reach the cityâ€™s $300,000 goal this year, Commissioner Pete Byron said. ....Byron noted that Brigantine raises more money from off-road vehicle permits than it does from beach tags. From January to May 2015, that city received $400,125 in revenue from the permits, with 2,881 permits sold. Brigantine also charges for beach tags. Despite the dollars raised from the concessions, Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and North Wildwood officials plan to discuss whether beach tags are needed during the off-season, Byron told the Press of AC. \nGet Philadelphia Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:42:52.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
