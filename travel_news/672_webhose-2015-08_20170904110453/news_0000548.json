Either they disappear completely or they go straggly with inch-long rogue hairs sprouting out, and they won’t lie flat whatever you do. Eyebrows define and frame the face . Or at least, they do when they are neat and trim. There is nothing, simply nothing, so ageing as brows that are all over the place. For many years, my own eyebrows had been the bane of my life. Even though I have adhered to Joan Collins’ famous dictum that the best beauty aid for older faces to is to keep your eyebrow pencil pin-sharp, that advice was no longer working for me. Joan Collins recommends thin, sharp eyebrows (Rex) I now needed another, more drastic solution, so when a much younger friend at the gym said she was going to have her eyebrows tattooed , I said I would like to go too. The eyebrow technician she knew – yes, there are such people – specialises in a new technique known as hairstroke, by which permanent individual strokes are applied with an electric pen. This means that the eyebrows look natural, rather than as if two fat slugs have been deposited on your forehead. Would it hurt, I wondered? Was it expensive? Did it take ages? The answer to all three questions was, I would learn, a painful yes. The procedure would take about four hours in all, require two visits and cost £300 – vastly more than even the sharpest eyebrow pencil. Before going I had to fill out a lengthy medical-type questionnaire about any health conditions, medications or allergies I might have. Clearly, these tattoos – a permanent answer to difficult eyebrows – were not something to be taken lightly. My eyebrows will always look perfect, even when I have just woken up in the morning I had never had a tattoo before, and am highly sensitive to pain anyway , but really, there was no choice. I either had to live with elderly, white, undefined eyebrows for the rest of my life, or grit my teeth for the sake of perfect, dark, arched ones. My friend, Ali, and I drove to the beauty therapist’s super-clean, ultra-hygienic clinic just outside Witney – Cameron’s constituency – and I sat and watched while she went first. She chose a colour from a chart and the therapist plucked out all the stray hairs that would spoil the line. She then applied local anaesthetic. The hairstrokes started to be drilled in one by one and Ali chatted happily throughout. This can’t be too bad, I thought - until it was my turn. I also chose my colour – a dark brown – and laid down on the table to subject myself to the same treatment. Ouch! My God! It was total agony. Please, please, finish, I silently pleaded as each stroke of pure torture was applied. The feeling was like having my face drilled deeply with a Black and Decker. Liz in 2007 before her tattoo and Liz now (Andrew Hasson/Andrew Crowley) Eventually our therapist decided she had drilled into me quite me enough and invited me to see the results. Well – what a difference. In place of the undefined straggles, was a neat arched machined line. But the ordeal was not over. Not only would we have to return in a few weeks for another drilling but in the interim, there was a lot of aftercare. We had to apply balm night and morning, there would be itching and possibly swelling, and we must not on any account expose our faces to the sun or a tanning salon during the healing period. In the meantime, the colour would get lighter. The damaged skin would take four to six weeks to heal, after which Ali and I had to go for a return visit, when the torture would be repeated. This time it was even more painful, possibly because there were scars from the last time although once again, Ali was far more stoical than me. She already had many decorative tattoos, and said she was used to it. On my first public outing with the new eyebrows my ex-husband said that I looked easily ten years younger. I’ll raise a glass to that, or perhaps an eyebrow, because truly, there are few more rejuvenating treatments than expertly tattooed eyebrows. It is now two months since my debut inking and I am delighted with the results. Nothing else would have done the job and it is definitely the answer, or was for me. Of course, you cannot stop the eyebrows from growing at all angles, and they still have to be plucked. Or, if you prefer, you can go for threading , which is my solution. I am now confident in the knowledge that whatever else, my eyebrows will always look perfect, even when I have just woken up in the morning. Although the technique is considered permanent, it is only guaranteed to last five years, after which time you may need to have them tattooed again, although this is not such a major operation as the first time. When we proudly showed off our new eyebrows to our buddies at the gym, another friend was so impressed she immediately signed up for the same treatment. Afterwards, she said did not consider it painful as she had had electrolysis on her upper lip , and that was far, far worse. Before the treatment, I would never have believed eyebrows could make such a difference. Now I am a true convert, proudly proselytizing a beauty treatment that actually works. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:23:37.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
