The zoo is unique in that it offers an intimate setting which allows visitors a closer look at the animals than most sprawling zoo settings. \nAlthough established in 1868 (making it one of the oldest zoos in the United States), the zoo has been continuously updated and is amongst the most contemporary in terms of education, recreation, and conservation. This beautiful zoo has masterfully integrated modern exhibits with the traditional Chicago architecture of its past. \nAdhering to their slogan \"Lincoln Park Zoo is everyone's zoo\", the zoo is dedicated to permanently keeping its admission policy -- everyone, young and old, can enter for free, 365 days a year. Lincoln Park Zoo is the only free zoo in Chicago, and one of the last free major wildlife attractions in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:52:47.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
