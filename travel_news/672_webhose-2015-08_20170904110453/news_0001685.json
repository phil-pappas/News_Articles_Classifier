So there are times when supplementing your diet with vitamins and minerals may help you get the essential daily vitamins needed when it comes to nutrition, fitness and skincare. Solgar was founded more than 60 years ago, and today its products are distributed in more than 50 countries. Its expansive range of science-based health products are based on the latest clinical trials and backed by rigorous scientific evidence, setting a “gold standard” for product quality and attention to detail within the vitamin and mineral industry. Solgar applies these high standards to everything it does, from its rigorous system of quality controls to its purity and potency guarantee. Solgar supports you through life’s journey, whether you're an expectant mother or athlete, through to encouraging cognitive ability in later life You can see this “gold standard” in action throughout the production process, right down to the company’s signature recyclable amber glass bottles. Although these \"old style\" medicine bottles cost more, Solgar uses them because they provide the best protection against heat, light, and moisture, preserving nutrient potency. And Solgar’s commitment does not end there. The packaging materials used for deliveries are recycled egg cartons and newspaper off-cuts of recycled paper. The company has been carbon neutral since 2000, planting about 10,000 saplings to counter emissions from deliveries and company cars. Solgar also invests in carbon-credit offset projects and has invested in projects across the globe, including wind farms and solar energy schemes. The Solgar range comprises more than 400 products, including vegetarian, kosher, vegan and halal options. Most are free from sugar, salt, starch, soya, yeast, wheat, gluten and dairy products and contain no preservatives, artificial flavours or colours. Solgar products support you through life’s journey, whether you are an expectant mother, an athlete or in your golden years.
