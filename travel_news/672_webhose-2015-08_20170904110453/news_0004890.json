Our trek was the Moss Pass route via the Sabine and D'Urville valleys, and one which I first attempted as a novice tramper in my late teens from Wellington one mid-winter. Our first full day's tramp this trip is a route march with cold, misty conditions, a good track to follow up the Sabine, but a long way to go to reach Blue Lake Hut. The upper valley track, bordered by waterfalls and huge bluffs, climbs steadily through forest, open meadows, and stunted beech to reach the large amphitheatre in which Blue Gem Lake resides. The nearby hut is set back among the trees west of the lake. Blue Gem Lake, as it has now been so aptly named, is a unique feature in a unique mountain landscape. Scientific experiments have proven its clarity to be almost optically perfect. It approaches 80m visibility and so is some of the purest water in the world, surpassing even the renowned Pupu Springs in Golden Bay. That's quite a test. But when you look at the lake water on a superb afternoon, it is not hard to attribute such absolute purity to it – it literally shines out of its 6m depths.

A faultless blue sky hung over the Mahanga Range and Main Divide as we reached the lip of the massive rock dam. \nThis gin-clear lake reflected every mountain face in the vicinity, all newly decked with snow. We walked the shore and scrambled back up to the top of the dam through snowy blocks and teetered along a narrow rib to reach the crest before returning to Blue Gem Lake. \nPre-dawn found us assembled outside the hut on a dark and freezing morning to begin the climb to Moss Pass 600m above on the crest of the Mahanga Range where it briefly dips into a narrow gut at 1785m. \nThe climb is relatively easy, however this does not lessen the steep angle and culminates in a 40-45 degree couloir packed with powder snow up which the route ascends to reach a small basin just 50m below the crest. \nThe couloir is a challenge, as the snow is thigh deep near the top and in places waist deep so requires a great deal of effort. Still, the day is fine and clear with no wind, so we make steady headway to the lip of the gully where we can haul out into the sunlit basin just below the crest. \nIt is amazing to be here with the length of the Sabine Valley stretched out below us - a long, green and gold alleyway, rimmed either flank with great bastions of snow and rock. Our perch is sublime and heightened further as we gain the pass summit and can view the wild, wide gulch of the D'Urville Valley. Lower down we pass into a large basin at 1500m. \nIn such a setting on this day-of-days in the hills it is hard to leave the tops so we take lunch here near a tarn and Fr Antoine offers Mass on a small knoll overlooking the chasm that drops to the D'Urville far below. Ad Feedback \nLate afternoon brings us to the D'Urville River where we can hike the bush terraces at an easy stride until crossing a swingbridge to the west bank and joining with the main valley track down to George Lyon Hut. \nWith just two rooms, there's an intimate ambience to staying here as a small group. With the log burner roaring well into the night it's a cosy haven as the night cold grips the valley now roofed with stars. \nNext day thick frost makes us move quickly down valley through forest and glade until we arrive at the new Morgan Hut for lunch. Morgan is a beauty, well sited, clean, modern, warm and with a great view at the southern edge of a large river flat catching all the sun that's going. \nEntries in the hut book warn of major windfall damage in the lower valley after the massive storm that hit this area and much of the West Coast in 2014. \nThe damage is plain to see from out on the flats – whole hillsides have been laid waste, massive trees snapped off at their bases and thrown to the ground like so much matchwood. It's a sobering sight. We make excellent time and arrive at the lower flats in three hours, leaving an hour of easy walking to D'Urville Hut, which lies just across the bay from Lakehead Hut where we began out journey five days earlier. \nThe evening is calm and clear. Every sigh of the lake reflects the beauty of the open tops, and we have time to enjoy the last night out, at fireside, on the long way round to the D'Urville. \nFact File \nAccess: From Lake Rotoroa Village at the northern end of the lake up the Gowan Valley Road off SH6 east of Murchison. \nTime: 4-5 days \nMap: Nelson Lakes Park map - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T07:03:47.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
