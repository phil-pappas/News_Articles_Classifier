Ventilated hip-belt fins keep the backpack secure during a ride. They also include small pockets, as does one of the shoulder straps, which is great for storing a phone. Inside the pack is room for a hydration reservoir, while the outside features a LidLock attachment for holding a bike helmet. A pull-out, high-visibility rain cover is also useful.\nDeuter Futura 22\nA smaller daypack, but with a clever suspension system, this one (HK$870, wellmount.hk ) has a Aircomfort Flexlite System mesh barrier that curves outwards, lifting the pack away from your back. However, the advanced design does mean an awkwardly shaped bag that is more difficult to pack. It has well-padded straps and hip-belt fins (both pocketless) and features a rain cover, a wet laundry pocket and room for a hydration reservoir. This is unbeatable for staying dry.\nJack Wolfskin ACS Stratosphere 15\nA good way to stay cooler is to try a smaller backpack. Built to hold a maximum of 15 litres, the Stratosphere 15 (HK$758, Sogo Department Store, Causeway Bay, tel: 2831 8581) has a central ventilation channel between mesh fabrics and perforated padding, combining the design of the other two backpacks. The shoulder straps and hip belt are comfortable, but small and less secure. However, since it includes space for a hydration reservoir and a rain cover, the lightweight design will appeal to hikers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:00:05.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
