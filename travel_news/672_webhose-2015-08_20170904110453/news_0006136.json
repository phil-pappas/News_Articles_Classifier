By Paige Cornwell Seattle Times staff reporter \nThe massive fire in Chelan County grew nearly 2 square miles overnight, moving closer to two communities, officials said Thursday morning. \nThe Wolverine fire near Lake Chelan is now about 42 square miles, according to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center. The blaze is about 4.5 miles east of Holden Village, which was evacuated July 31, and 2 miles southwest of Stehekin. \nHelicopters dropped water on the fire Wednesday, but air operations were shut down in the afternoon because of high winds and poor visibility from smoke. Firefighters are preparing a fire line along the Stehekin River Trail to prevent the fire from spreading into Stehekin, and are trimming brush and cut limbs from trees in Holden Village. \nRock and fire debris are falling on the road from Lucerne to Holden, however, making it difficult to keep the road open for crews.
