This organization filed a Petition with the United States Department of Transportation on February 11, 2015, calling for DOT to cap international ticket “change fees at no more than $100 unless an airline shows a reasonable cost basis for a higher amount. \nPaul Hudson told eTN: \"We are glad to see Congress is finally recognizing that there are serious problems with airline abuses that need Congress' attention. It has been over 37 years since Congress deregulated airlines based on the theory that competition would make for better service and lower prices. Today airline consolidation and exemptions from consumer protection and antitrust laws has led to cartel like behavior of high prices, restricted supply and poor service producing historically high airline profits.\" \nA new congressional report published today took aim at the airline industry for failing to adequately disclose extra fees and add-on costs charged to the flying public. \nThe report, released by the minority staff of the Senate Commerce Committee, found that ancillary fees, such as change and cancellation penalties and preferred seating, are increasingly keeping consumers in the dark about the true cost of air travel. It also made a number of recommendations requiring more transparency from the airline industry. \n“The traveling public is being nickel-and-dimed to death,” said Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), the panel’s top Democrat. “What’s worse is that many flyers don’t learn about the actual cost of their travel until it’s too late.” Nelson said he intends to press his colleagues to act on the report’s recommendations when the Senate begins its work on legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration. \nIn the case of preferred seating charges, the report found that consumers who purchase tickets through airline websites are sometimes only presented seats which require an additional fee. In such instances, many travelers often pay the fee, unaware that the airlines will randomly assign them an available free seat at a later date. \nAdditionally, the review found that consumers generally did not receive prominent or clear flight change and cancellation fee disclosures when they purchased tickets from airline websites. In some instances, penalties for changing flight plans can double the cost of travel – even when the change is made far in advance of the flight. \nAmong the report’s recommendations: \nBetter and earlier disclosure of ancillary fees to help consumers compare costs among airlines; Require checked baggage and carry-on baggage fees to have a clear connection between the costs incurred by the airline and the baggage fees charged; \nRequire airlines to promptly refund fees for any bags that are delayed more than 6 hours on a domestic flight; \nLimit airline change fees to a reasonable amount tied to lead time prior to departure and an amount less than the original fare; Mandate that airlines place clear disclosures that “preferred seat” charges are optional; \nRequire airline and travel agency websites to have a clear and conspicuous links to the Department of Transportation’s Aviation Consumer Protection website; and, \nUpdate the Department of Transportation’s Aviation Consumer Protection website to better assist the flying public. \nThe report comes at a time of growing traveler frustration over airline fees. According to one recent study, airlines around the world pocketed a record $38.1 billion in extra fees last year – an increase of more than 1400% since 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:08:26.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
