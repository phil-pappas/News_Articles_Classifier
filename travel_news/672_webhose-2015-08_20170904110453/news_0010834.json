As a result, revenues in our financial statements for the second quarter of 2015 and comparable periods in the second quarter of 2014 and in the previous quarter reflected revenues from continuing operations only.\nRevenues decreased by 32.8% year-over-year and 31.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$11.9 million.\nNet revenues decreased by 33.7% year-over-year and 32.5% quarter-over-quarter to US$11.6 million.\nNet loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders was US$19.4 million. Basic and diluted net loss attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) were both US$0.32.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders (non-GAAP), which is EBITDA from continuing operations attributable to AirMedia’s shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses, was a loss of US$15.8 million, compared to a loss of US$11.7 million in the same period one year ago.\n“We are excited about the Transaction with Longde Wenchuang. We believe the Transaction reflects positively upon the quality of the relevant advertising business and will further improve our cash balance. We may exit additional business lines, including certain unprofitable advertising product lines and some non-core businesses so that we can narrow the loss and focus on our emerging Wi-Fi business,” commented Mr. Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of AirMedia.\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results\nRevenues\nRevenues from continuing operations\nRevenues from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by 32.8% year-over-year and by 31.3% quarter-over-quarter to US$11.9 million. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily due to a soft advertising market and the divestiture of TV-attached digital frames and digital TV screens in airports in February 2015, as previously discussed in our first quarter 2015 financial results.\nSource:-AirMedia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:12:22.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
