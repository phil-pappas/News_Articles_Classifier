He fell into a passing pedestrian, who in turn then fell heavily on Mr Gardiner’s injured right leg. In all he suffered 13 fractures, tore a calf muscle and dislocated a knee and hip. It soon became apparent that the doctors were unable to repair his leg and, 11 months later, he was forced to undergo an amputation just below his right knee. Not surprisingly, it took some time to recover, mentally as well as physically. But once he had, Mr Gardiner turned to sport – with remarkable results. He has represented Great Britain’s shooting team at the World Championships, competed in the main field of the London Marathon (as one of the first five people ever to do so in a wheelchair), holed the winning putt in the 2011 Disabled British Open Golf Championship, and even climbed to the base camp of Mount Everest at 17,000ft. I had just removed the plastic from the head of the new club before taking the shot. Needless to say, I think the club works Despite not taking up golf until 2010, he has brought his handicap down to one and has just had his 10th hole-in-one – which came at his home club, Cherwell Edge in North Oxfordshire, on the 194-yard, par-three fifth. This feat earned him a limited-edition, commemorative BOSS watch to mark the occasion. Mr Gardiner said: “I played a five-iron that I’d never used before – I had just removed the plastic from the head before taking the shot. Needless to say, I think the club works!” The inspirational golfer, who now lives in Fritwell, Oxfordshire, is currently the European Disabled Golf Association (EDGA) world No 2. He will be competing in the second EDGA Algarve Open at Pestana Vila Sol, from November 17-22, where the winner of the 2015 EDGA Premier Series Order of Merit will be crowned. Family matters Meanwhile, a poignant round of golf for Chris Thomas became a day to treasure when he had a hole-in-one at the very same hole that his son and late father had aced. Mr Thomas, 47, a member at St Augustine’s Golf Club in his home town of Ramsgate, Kent, was competing in the June monthly Stableford when he found the missing piece to the jigsaw on the 156-yard, par-three 15th. Happy memories: the mounted ball used by Chris's father, Capt JL Thomas, to slot his 1961 hole-in-one The six-handicapper said: “On August 7, 1961, my late father, Major John Thomas – who played off a nine handicap – had a hole-in-one on the 15th at St Augustine’s from 135 yards and I still have the ball mounted in a plaque as a memento. \"I was lucky to play with my dad about 30 times before he passed away. “On July 3, 2012, my son – aged 16 at the time and playing off five – amazingly achieved an ace on the very same hole. \"I was so proud to follow in the footsteps of my father and son to make it a family hat-trick, and, to make it extra special, I’ve received a BOSS watch as a permanent reminder.” BOSS Watches H1 Club BOSS Watches has once again pledged to reward club golfers with an exclusive watch for every hole-in-one recorded during a club competition in 2015, having given away more than £1m-worth of limited-edition timepieces since its launch in 2013. The scheme is open to any golfer whose club uses HowDidiDo – a free-to use, web-based social network for golfers – and anybody playing in official club competitions is eligible. Currently, more than 1,800 clubs use the website. In addition to the limited-edition watches, the “ace” golfers join more than 7,000 members in the BOSS Watches H1Club, which offers access to exclusive benefits and merchandise. No extra registration is required to participate in the BOSS Watches promotion as all official club competitions are recorded on the HowDidiDo system, so holes-in-one are noted and automatically ratified by the golfer’s club. www.H1Club.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:49:36.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
