It represents the first time the property has made a quarterly profit since opening in 2010.\nAn affiliate of private equity firm Blackstone bought the 1,998-room high-rise in December for nearly $1.73 billion.\nThe property's financial filing shows the company cut expenses by nearly 17 per cent in the three month period. While the company earned 20 per cent more in its casinos, revenue dropped at its bars and restaurants, shops and entertainment venues.\nHotel revenue dipped slightly on lower occupancy. The company says it hosted 13 entertainment events this quarter compared to 24 a year ago and its Marquee nightclub faced increased competition.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T09:55:05.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
