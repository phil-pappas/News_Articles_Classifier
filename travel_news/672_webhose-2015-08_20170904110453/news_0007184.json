But our work is not done. \n“We are determined to stand up for passengers and will continue to review how airlines are treating, and responding to, their customers in practice. \n“Furthermore, while we recognise not every claim for compensation will be eligible, we are keen to hear from people who feel they have not been treated fairly and where we believe airlines are not complying with the law, we will pursue all available enforcement options.” \nHaines added the authority is still dealing with Wizz Air over its failure to extend the two-year limit on its claims and has now referred the claim to the HACP which it says is the local regulator best placed to take forward this enforcement action. \nA Jet2 spokeswoman declined to comment on the changes. Both Wizz Air and Aer Lingus were unavailable for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:19:53.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
