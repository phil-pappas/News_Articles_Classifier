Officials at Denver-based XTI Aircraft Co. are using equity crowd funding to raise money to help build a business aircraft capable of vertical takeoffs and landings. XTI’s leadership includes a tie to Wichita. Board member Charles Johnson is a former CEO of Cessna Aircraft Co. , where he succeeded Russ Meyer in 2003. According to a report from the Denver Business Journal, the six-seat, fixed-wing aircraft — known as the TriFan 600 — will come with a price tag of $10 million to $12 million. The company has been developing the aircraft for over two years and its StartEngine page says that after raising sufficient funds it hopes to build and fly the first prototype of the TriFan 600 in another two-and-a-half years. It says it views equity crowdsourcing as a way of involving all those interested in the project as true stakeholders. \nGet Wichita Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T03:17:58.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
