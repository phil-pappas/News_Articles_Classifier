The remaining 24.9 per cent would be paid to minority shareholder Auckland International Airport Limited. \nGilks said the growth in revenue was driven by strong passenger volumes, greater retail spend per passenger, more car parking and improved commercial leasing revenues. \nTotal passenger movements through the airport increased 12 per cent, setting a new record of 1.4 million passengers in the 12 months to June 2015. \nThe main contributors to the increase in passengers were strong trans-Tasman passenger growth, buoyed by the recommencement of Jetstar's Gold Coast service, and domestic passenger numbers hitting the one million mark for the first time. \nInternational passenger numbers were up 29 per cent to 398,000 while domestic passengers rebounded, up 6 per cent to 1,001,000. \nTo manage the demands of growth and improve passenger flow, the corporation complete key infrastructure projects during the year including a public carpark expansion, a temporary 'pop-up' structure to expand the international arrivals area for winter 2014 and a new international terminal for winter 2015 which has doubled the size of the airport's international operations. \nA commercial and retail improvement programme started two years ago had also pushed up the rate of revenue growth from those activities exceeding that of aeronautical. \nNew offerings in the past year included Airspresso Caf√© and Bar, the Manaia Passenger Lounge and TravelPharm. \nGilks said the appeal of Queenstown and the surrounding region as a domestic and international travel destination remained strong. \nThe forward schedules of Air New Zealand, Jetstar, Qantas, and Virgin Australia remained strong. \n\"In particular, Air New Zealand's commitment to adding more than 110,000 additional seats between Queenstown and Auckland in FY2016 is extremely positive,\" he said. \nKey growth opportunities included: \n- Planning to introduce evening flights \n- Creating a new aviation precinct with the proposed acquisition of approximately 16ha of land (Lot 6) from developer Remarkables Park Limited \n- Working closely with local government and businesses in Queenstown to encourage investment in visitor infrastructure \n- Continuing the rollout of QAC's 20-year noise mitigation works plan for acoustic treatment packages in the homes identified as most affected by aircraft noise. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:46:19.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
