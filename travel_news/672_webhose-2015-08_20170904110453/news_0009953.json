According to local media sources some tourists visiting Mount Rigi in the Swiss Alps have become exasperated with the behavoiur of the Chinese tourists. The tourists crowd in the corridors and take pictures from the train. They have also been blamed for displaying rude behaviour and some have also been seen spitting in the train floor. There is a great deal of outrage over Asian visitors on a whole especially the Chinese.\nAlmost half of the visitors to Mount Rigi are from China. Special trains for Asian tourists have been introduced but they are not looked after as toilets are not cleaned regularly and also signs have been put up showing how to clean and use the toilets properly. The mountain’s management has entered in a partnership with an organistion from Chinese Mount Emei. The company also plans to offer 20 more special trains in a week for Asian tourists.\nThis discrimination has offended many Chinese travellers and Chinese news agencies have criticized this move especially when Chinese travellers are helping in bringing an economic boom for Switzerland. But the Swiss company has tried to mellow the tension by saying that Chinese tourists will not be prevented from boarding ordinary trains.\nChinese tourists are the most sought after the world over and regardless of their behaviour being starkly different from their European counterparts, they are still welcome all around the globe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:14:25.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
