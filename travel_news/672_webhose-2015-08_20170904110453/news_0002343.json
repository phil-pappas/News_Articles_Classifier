My partner Peter and I had three days at the Esperas hotel in Oia and four days at the Aigialos in Fira.\nIt turned out to be an absolutely brilliant week.\nCorrie star Antony Cotton spent plenty of time admiring sunsets when he wasn't exploring the island\nWe were primarily looking for complete relaxation. We wanted to lie by the pool and enjoy the sunshine, but we were also keen to see something of the island. We hired a car so we were able to do a bit of wandering around to enjoy the scenery.\nSantorini has a long and fascinating history. It is linked to the Atlantis legend, and some people believe it was a huge volcanic explosion on Santorini that caused the biblical plagues which afflicted Egypt, and also caused the sea to part.\nThe island is relatively small but has an airport with a variety of connections to the UK.\n Next An Inspector Calls: Head for the Scottish Borders to find a...

Thomas Cook tells holidaymakers they WON’T get a refund for... 99 shares First things first: the sunset. It was more beautiful than you can possibly imagine. The Esperas hotel is in a row of traditional houses and, with its huge balcony, our room offered the perfect sunset vantage point. Every evening we simply wandered outside to enjoy the most extraordinary spectacle.\nThe small town of Oia is built into the side of what was a volcano. From our hotel it was a steep walk down a lot of steps to the sea. There are few organised activities and not a huge amount of nightlife – but this suited us fine.\nThe busiest islanders are the donkeys that take tourists up and down from the harbour. It’s hard work for them in the heat of the day.\nAntony and his partner, Peter, spent seven nights in Santorini as he took a break from filming\nAnother highlight of the holiday was the food. We ate out in a couple of places in Fira and Oia. We had an excellent meal at Fino restaurant in Oia, and I can recommend an amazing bar called Hasapiko, also in Oia.\nThe bar is in what used to be the village butcher’s, and it had what looked like ancient blood-flecked meat-hooks driven into the brickwork by the front door. Hasapiko was a great place – it’s where all the hip young kids went.\nWe had wonderful seafood at a seafront restaurant called Dimitris, and I had an amazing fillet steak at the Aigialos hotel. In fact both the hotels we stayed at were first-class.\nGETTING THERE Sunvil Holidays ( sunvil.co.uk/greece , 020 8758 4758) offers a two-centre, seven-night stay on Santorini from £1,169pp.\nThe price includes return flights from Gatwick or Manchester, transfers, four nights’ B&B at the Esperas Traditional Houses and three nights’ bed and breakfast at the Aigialos Traditional Settlement Hotel.\nIf you’re looking for a great holiday, I don’t think you could find anywhere more beautiful than the island of Santorini. We loved the peace and quiet, and the local people were so kind and friendly.\nAnd then there are those fabled sunsets. I’ll never forget them. The hotel sold lovely champagne and, each night, we would have a little glass on the terrace as we watched the sun go down.\nI’ve enjoyed sunsets in plenty of places, but Santorini’s somehow seemed different. It was so dramatic: one moment the sun was there and everything was light, and then, within what seemed like half a second, it was gone… and the nightlife could begin.\nPerfect!\nGreece is having a tough time at the moment with all of its financial problems, and holidaymakers have understandably been worried about going there.\nBut just because the country is having economic difficulties, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t visit. In fact, it’s a reason why we should go, to help them get back on their feet.\nPlaces such as Santorini depend heavily on tourism. Now’s the time to visit.\nRead more: Greece Holidays | Greek Destinations | Sunvil", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1DZWt6K", "http://www.sunvil.co.uk/greece"], "published": "2015-08-02T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T23:03:55.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
