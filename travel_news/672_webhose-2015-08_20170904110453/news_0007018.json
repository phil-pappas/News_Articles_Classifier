The novel, published 200 years ago this year, led to a craze for the Dandie among Lords and Ladies, the rich, the famous and the titled of the age.\nAs well as naming the Dandie Dinmont breed, Sir Walter Scott helped to create the breed as it is thought that every Dandie in the world can trace their pedigree back to the Borders and a dog bred by the Scottish writer.\nSir Walter Scott (born on 15 August 1771) was a poet, novelist, ballad-collector, critic and man of letters, but is probably most renowned as the founder of the genre of the historical novel, involving tales of gallantry, romance and chivalry. Beginning with the publication of Waverley in 1814, his anonymously published Waverley novels proved hugely popular in Europe and America, and established his reputation as a major international literary force.\nVisitScotland is embarking on a national and international marketing and PR campaign to encourage visitors to experience the Borders Railway, and all the attractions along the route when the line opens in September 2015.\nIt is hoped that the worldwide interest in Sir Walter Scott will be a huge draw, as visitors can follow in the footsteps of the renowned writer, starting in Edinburgh with The Scott Monument and The Writers’ Museum, before taking the Borders Railway through the landscapes that inspired his writing. At the end of the journey, there’s Abbotsford, near Tweedbank, where a new award-winning visitor centre tells Scott’s remarkable story, from his birth in Edinburgh in 1771 to the cultural legacy he left to Scotland and the world.\nSource:-Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:25:24.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
