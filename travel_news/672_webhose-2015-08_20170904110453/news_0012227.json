Customers can now use DUFL and leave baggage hassles behind when traveling to business hubs in Europe and Canada as well as Singapore , Tokyo , Hong Kong , Sydney and Melbourne . DUFL customers who are planning an overseas trip can use the app to request a Quote: for international service, then virtually pack via the app and leave baggage transportation to DUFL.\nIn addition to serving US-based customers who are traveling to DUFL's expanded service regions, DUFL also allows customers who live outside the US to use DUFL for business travel within the US. Now those travelers who live abroad can keep a business wardrobe stateside with DUFL and breeze through customs baggage-free while DUFL ensures their suitcase is ready for them at their US destination.\nFrequent business travelers spend too much time laundering clothes, packing and unpacking and dragging suitcases through airports, time that could be better spent with their families at home or with clients when they arrive at their destination. This is especially true for international business travelers, who have traditionally had to deal with the added hassles of dealing with customs. DUFL's premium travel service functions as a personal valet, packing, shipping, cleaning and storing business attire so that it is ready when travelers arrive.\nWhen customers are gearing up for a business trip, they can use the DUFL app to select which clothes they want to bring from their virtual DUFL closet, enter a destination and arrival date and DUFL will take care of the rest, ensuring the customer's DUFL professionally packed suitcase is waiting at the hotel when the customer arrives. When it's time to go home, customers simply schedule a pickup via the app and leave the bag at the hotel's front desk, traveling home bag-free.\nUsers who live outside the US who want to start using the DUFL service should sign up prior to their next US business trip. They can download the free iOS or Android app or visit www.dufl.com in their mobile or desktop browser to create a user account. Once requested, a Welcome Kit, which contains a large DUFL suitcase, will be delivered to the traveler's US hotel. When the customer is ready to leave, he or she can transfer the road trip wardrobe – including toiletries – to the DUFL suitcase and schedule a pickup. DUFL picks the bag up and delivers it to their secure warehouse, where the customer's clothes will be inventoried, photographed, cleaned and stored in the customer's virtual closet until they are ready for their next US trip.\n\"DUFL really struck a chord with business travelers, who are ready to take advantage of new technology to make their lives easier,\" says Bill Rinehart , DUFL Founder and CEO. \"International travel already involves a significant time investment. DUFL takes cleaning, pressing, packing, baggage handling and customs hassles out of the equation so travelers can focus on taking care of business.\"\nDUFL's sophisticated logistics software streamlines baggage delivery and allows the company to get to know each user's style, favorite brands and travel patterns. This enables DUFL to create relevant offers and provide free samples through sponsors.\nAvailable via an iOS, Android and web app, DUFL has rapidly added members and attracted significant media attention.
