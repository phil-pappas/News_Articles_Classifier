But this isn’t an airport terminal for humans, it’s for travelling pets.\nNew York’s JFK Airport will open “The Ark” early next year to accommodate the 70,000 pets and livestock that come through the airport each year.\nThe 16,500 square metre building is set to cost $65 million ($USD48 million) and will have facilities for 186 cattle, 76 horses and up to 200 dogs and cats.\nClimate-controlled stables for horses.

Webcams will also be installed in the suites so owners can keep an eye on their beloved pet. It is expected to cost around $135 ($USD100) a night.\nFor horses there will be individually climate controlled stalls with bedding and natural light and for cattle there will be a pen with bends and turns suited to their single-file formation.\nThere will also be a departure lounge for waiting animals with horse stalls, food and water as well as a veterinary hospital.\n“The animal terminal will set new international airport standards for comprehensive veterinary, kennelling and quarantine services,” John J. Cuticelli Jr., Founder of Ark Development LLC and Racebrook Chairman, said in a statement.\nCurrently pets travelling through JFK go to the VetPort, a 900-square metre kennel built in the 1950s. Animals not accommodated there are sent to a quarantine centre two hours north of the airport.\n“The Ark” is set to open early 2016.\nCattle pens with bends and curves for walking. Picture: The Ark.
