Virginia Palla, ITP’s General Manager, said, “Traveller security has always been a high priority and corporate clients are always looking for ways to provide support for their employees when away on business. Mobile Messenger is an effective way of doing this”. Amadeus Mobile Messenger provides professional assistance for handling disruptive events such as weather events, political unrest or natural disasters, and allows two-way communication with travellers at any time. This ensures the agent/travel manager is always in complete control of the situation and provides peace of mind to travellers.
