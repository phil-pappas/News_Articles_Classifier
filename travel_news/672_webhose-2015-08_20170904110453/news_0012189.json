Interest-free days on purchases: Up to 44 Interest rate on cash advances: 21.74% p.a. Total international transaction fee: 3.0% (both cards) Minimum income requirement: None defined Minimum credit limit: $6,000 Bonus Qantas Points, interest-free deals\nApply by October 11 2015, make at least one purchase using your NAB Qantas Rewards Premium cards within 90 days of opening the account and you’ll pocket an easy 40,000 bonus Qantas Points.\nIf you're nursing an existing credit card balance with another bank, you can also bring it across to NAB and pay no interest for 15 months, after which the standard interest rate for purchases applies.\nThat’s great if you’re knee-deep in credit card debt and want to do something about it as 100% of your repayment amounts go straight towards lowering your balance, rather than interest charges siphoning off a solid chunk every month.\nJust a heads-up: you won't enjoy interest-free days on other purchases while you're carrying a balance, so when you first use the card to buy something – which triggers the 40,000 bonus points – be sure to promptly repay that amount in full, too.\nEarning frequent flyer points for free flights With a points cap so high that it's practically irrelevant for the 99%, here’s how much you’ll need to spend to earn enough points for a Qantas flight from Sydney to Melbourne.\nNAB Qantas Premium American Express: $8,000 for a no-cost flight or $5,334 plus a co-payment of $30.29 when booking your journey.\nNAB Qantas Premium Visa: $24,000 for a completely free trip or $16,000 plus the payment of $30.29 in taxes and fees.\nYou’ll also pocket an extra point per dollar when booking Qantas flights or paying for your Qantas Club membership, which puts you in the fast lane towards that next free flight.\nOn the flipside, payments to the Australian Taxation Office – such as for your income tax obligations or HECS debt repayment – don't earn any points at all, whether using the AMEX or the Visa.\nFree travel insurance, purchase protection NAB’s complimentary international travel and medical insurance coverage is reasonably generous, and switches on automatically after charging at least $500 of pre-paid transport or accommodation expenses to the card.\nThat’s anything from your return airfare through to Eurostar and other rail tickets, car or watercraft hire and any pre-paid hotel stays.\nFor domestic trips a subset of benefits apply covering flight delays, mishandled luggage and rental car insurance excess payments, along with insurance if your hotel or motel room is the subject of a burglary during your stay.\nOther free insurances include price protection, transport accident and purchase protection and up to 12 months of free extended warranty coverage when buying eligible new appliances with your NAB credit cards.\nHow it compares NAB stands out from the pack in serving up 1.5 Qantas Frequent Flyer points per dollar spent on a Platinum American Express card, and with a reasonable annual fee to match.\nCompare that to the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac – both of which have made Diamond or Black the new Platinum and in doing so began charging consumers higher annual fees to continue earning the same number of frequent flyer points on their AMEX cards.\nThat, however, assumes that American Express is both accepted and welcome surcharge-free where you transact the most, which may not always the case.\nJetstar’s Platinum MasterCard bridges the gap for non-AMEX spend at just $149 per year, amassing one Qantas Point per dollar – or twice what you’d earn on the NAB Qantas Rewards Premium Visa – for a total of $399 each year in annual fees when paired with the NAB cards.\nCompare that to the Westpac Altitude Black ($395), ANZ’s Frequent Flyer Black ($425) and CBA’s Diamond Awards ($349), and whichever way you look at it, you’re paying roughly the same in fees to earn considerably more points on home soil when that trusty back-up card comes into play, which it inevitably will.\nAlso read: Jetstar Platinum MasterCard review\nFollo w Austr alian Business Traveller on Twitter: we're @AusBT\nAbout Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on Email: [email protected]\nTwitter: @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review have something to say?
