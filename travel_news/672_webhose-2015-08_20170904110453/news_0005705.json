You’ve visited the Beaux Arts gallery full of Impressionists, toured the half-timbered old centre, and tackled the brand new, and belting, Historial devoted to Joan of Arc. Now proceed to the Seine riverbank, to what looks like a gas storage tank, except that it’s blue. This is the Panorama XXL. It is genuinely sense-smacking, a wraparound plunge into the ancient Rome of AD  312. This really is Rome, urbanised – temples, baths and all – to the Sabine Hills You have probably heard of “panoramas” – the huge 360-degree paintings that encircle the viewer with the illusion of continuous space. Robert Barker, a Geordie, created the first one (of Edinburgh) in 1792. • Joan of Arc: always handy when the English need a slapping • Normandy travel guide They took off terrifically, through the 19th century and into the 20th. Up to 100m long (or round) and perhaps 15m high, they purveyed artificial visual thrills to people innocent of moving pictures. Standing in the centre of purpose-built rotunda, the viewer was thrust into the turmoil of biblical scenes or raging battles. There is, for instance, a cracking cavalry charge panorama at Waterloo. After a 100 years, it still packs a punch. Robert Barker's two-level panorama at Leicester Square Subsequently, panoramas fell from fashion – we had films and television – but they’re right back, thanks not least to Berlin-based Yadegar Asisi. He has created the item on show in the huge, round, metal structure in Rouen. It is astonishing. You enter down a slightly darkened corridor. Suddenly, classical Rome is all around you, above you, everywhere. A central staircase allows access to three different-level viewing platforms, thus the perspective changes. Rouen's cathedral, painted into submission by Monet Photo: AP/FOTOLIA The work is 100m long, 35m high and created not so much with paint – as in the old days – as with thousands of photos, digital imaging, dozens of human “extras” and great slabs of invention. This really is Rome, urbanised – temples, baths and all – to the Sabine Hills. Such is the wealth of detail that it takes a while to spot Constantine triumphantly entering after seeing off Maxentius. • Mont Blanc panorama becomes the world’s largest ever photograph • Google Views: 10 spectacular natural wonders The whole is engrossing. There are things to spot, for an hour at least. One is both in the scene and overseeing it, a most remarkable sensation. The work will change on September 26, Rome being replaced by Amazonia. Later, in spring 2016, Amazonia cedes to Rouen itself – in 1431, the year Joan of Arc burnt in the city. If these two are as good as the present show, they will be very good, indeed. panoramaxxl.com ; £7, or £19 for a family of four More from Anthony Peregrine • The Franco-American love-fest • Napoleon or Wellington - who was better? • Why I’m embarrassed to be a non-smoker • The fêtes of our nations: bullfighting or tombola? • The perils of holidaying with friends • Why I love motorways • The joy of dining alone - and why my satnav is the perfect woman Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:52:05.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
