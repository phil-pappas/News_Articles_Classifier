Millard Editorial Intern Phoenix Business Journal Related Content Enlarge Mexico's Volaris Airlines will soon begin flights between Phoenix Sky Harbor… more Mexico City-based Volaris will offer twice weekly direct flights between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Hermosillo, Mexico, according to a statement the city of Phoenix released Wednesday. Flights between Phoenix and Hermosillo will take off on Tuesdays and Saturdays starting Nov. 3, according to Volaris’ website. This is not Volaris' first international flight out of Sky Harbor as it offers direct flights to Guadalajara and connections from there to Mexico City. US Airways also offers direct flights to Hermosillo. British Airways also operates a direct flight from Phoenix to London. Sky Harbor has been working with the Arizona Office of Tourism to bring in more visitors to the state and Phoenix has been focusing on increasing business between Phoenix and Mexico in recent times, said Deborah Ostreicher , assistant director of aviation at Sky Harbor. \"This new flight is an excellent example of efforts moving forward,\" she said. Passengers will be traveling to and from Hermosillo for both business and leisure, Ostreicher said. Sky Harbor has struggled to land international flights while watching nearby markets such as Los Angeles secure new routes. Demographics and a dearth of corporate headquarters work against Phoenix when airlines are scoping out places for new international flights. \"Volaris’ new direct route between Hermosillo and Phoenix increases our connectivity with our No. 1 trading partner,\" said Phoenix Vice Mayor Daniel Valenzuela . \"This is a critical component in our comprehensive plan to grow trade and increase economic cooperation.\" In 2012, Arizona State University conducted a study on the economic impact of nonstop international flights from Sky Harbor and it found visitors from nonstop international flights departing from Mexico spent nearly $42 million in 2011. There were 658 departures from Sky Harbor to Hermosillo in 2011, according to the study. If someone were to book a round trip ticket from Phoenix to Hermosillo today through Volaris, for a single adult it would cost $219.16. \nWant Phoenix Travel news in your inbox?
