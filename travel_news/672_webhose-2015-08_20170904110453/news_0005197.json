Delta is the only US carrier to fly directly between the United States and Johannesburg.\nDelta said in a statement the ban was effective immediately.\nA roiling debate over species conservation has followed the killing in Zimbabwe of a 13-year-old lion, Cecil, by Minneapolis dentist and trophy hunter Walter Palmer, as well as a second lion killing by an American dentist, Jan Seski of Pittsburgh.\nAuthorities in Zimbabwe have launched investigations into both killings.\nPalmer said he killed the lion in a hunt he believed was legal. Seski has made no public statement.\nBefore Delta's ban, the airline's policy required \"absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species,\" it said.\nDelta will also review policies on accepting other hunting trophies, the airline said.\nNearly 400,000 people signed a Change petition that was started by a Delta customer calling for the airline to stop shipping exotic hunting trophies.\nThe most popular Change petition, which has 1 million signatures, calls for the US Fish and Wildlife Service to list African lions as a threatened species and punishment for those involved in Cecil's death.\nThe United States has the world's most powerful animal protection law, the Endangered Species Act, which has been extended by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to many non-US species including the African elephant and cheetah.\nAdding the African lion to the US list would not prohibit trophy hunting but it would require a permit from the service to import lions or their body parts to the United States.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T04:28:13.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
