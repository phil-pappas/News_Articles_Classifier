The approximately one-year-old turtle had already suffered some wounds, most likely while attempting to free itself from the netting, explained Kongkiat Kittiwattanawong, head of the Phuket Marine Biological Center’s Endangered Species Unit. \"Though this particular turtle is now safe, it is necessary that fishermen are aware of the impact that they can have. They must be careful and not just toss damaged equipment into the sea,\" Dr Kongkiat said. - See more at: http://www. phuket gazette.net/ phuket -news/Phuket-tourist-saves-turtle-fishing-net/61672#ad-image-0 223 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:15:13.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
