I apologise to passengers for the delays and thank them for their understanding.”\nA spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: “Shortly before 2.30am on Friday 21 August 2015, police were called to Westcoast Train Care on Kirkmanshulme Lane, Longsight after a suspicious bag was found on a train.\n“Officers attended and an investigation has been launched with support from the fire service and British Transport Police. A small cordon remains in place whilst assessments of the bag are being carried out, which unfortunately may cause some delays to trains scheduled to leave or arrive in Manchester. Enquiries are on-going.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:34:23.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
