This was driven by strong operational performance at Aeroflot airline and the successful roll-out of Russia’s first low-cost carrier, Pobeda, which has quickly become one the top airlines in the country. The Group also benefited from changes in the competitive landscape, taking market share from foreign carriers that decreased frequencies on a number of routes as well as less efficient Russian peers.\n“Our focus on the high-growth domestic market paid off with strong increases in Group traffic, which drove revenue up 25.8% year-on-year to RUB 176.5 billion, while strict cost control reined in growth of operational expenses despite exchange rate volatility. As a result, in the first half of 2015 Aeroflot Group posted an operating profit of RUB 5.9 billion; EBITDA and EBITDAR also rose, and the EBITDA and EBITDAR margins increased 3.9 and 6.9 percentage points to 7.5% and 18.8%, respectively.\n“The Group focused on fleet optimisation, cost-cutting, boosting efficiency of business processes and financial management, and maintaining a robust financial position. We are confident our policy of expanding our presence on the growing Russian market, maintaining customer loyalty and increasing business efficiency will enable continued growth in the Group’s profitability as the Russian economy recovers.”\nSource:- Aeroflot", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:58:37.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
