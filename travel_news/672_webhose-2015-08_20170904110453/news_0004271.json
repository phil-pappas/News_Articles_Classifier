The FAO-brokered agreement comes into force when 25 countries have deposited their instrument of ratification, known as acceptance of accession. So far, 12 countries have done so, the latest being Iceland in June. Two more states will soon join them, according to FAO. \nIn addition to Iceland, signatories that have completed the ratification process are Chile, the European Union, Gabon, Iceland, Mozambique, Myanmar, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Uruguay. \n“The Agreement promotes collaboration between fishermen, port authorities, coast guards and navies to strengthen inspections and control procedures at ports and on vessels,” it said. “Importantly, it also allows states to prevent the landings of catches derived from IUU fishing by vessels regardless of the flag they fly.” \nBlaise Kuemlangan, Chief of FAO's Development Law Service, said “the Agreement aims to harmonize port controls in order to prevent illegally caught fish from ever entering international markets through ports.” \nThe ability to turn away vessels taking part in illegal fishing will greatly reduce opportunities for selling their catch, decreasing illicit fishing worldwide, according to Mr. Kuemlangan. \nThe Agreement will also enable better compliance with the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, which seeks to promote the long-term sustainability of the sector. \nTo assist countries in building their capacity to implement the agreement, FAO has convened workshops in all world regions, with the Atlantic coast of Africa being “a key priority,” the agency said. FAO said so far Gabon is the only African country to have ratified the Agreement, but several others are close to completing the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T22:34:43.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
