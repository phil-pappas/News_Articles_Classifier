If you are a traveler with an interest in that theme — or have gone to a place that happens to be included in the trail, and you liked it — chances are you'll like other places along the trail, too. \nIf you've come to Virginia to shop for handmade crafts, for instance, local tourism officials and craft organizations have already done most of the legwork for you with their Virginia Artisans Trail Network ( www.artisanscenterofvirginia.org ). They have put together 13 trails throughout the state, so you can undoubtedly find a trail no matter what area you're visiting. Pick up a map at one of the participating sites or visitor centers (or online), and it will highlight the artisan-related places of interest. \nToday the trails have become ways to explore new parts of a world we may have thought we knew, only to turn up new discoveries. \nI remember one of the first such trails I ever followed, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail ( nynjtc.org/park/new-jersey-coastal-heritage-trail ), led all the way around the Shore's 127 miles of coastline and pointed out historic, natural, cultural and other attractions along the way. It was how I discovered not only some unusual sights (Tinicum Island Rear Range Light, a lighthouse in the Billingsport section of Paulsboro) but some of my favorites to this day (Cheesequake State Park, Allaire Village). \nDiscovering new places and getting off the beaten path are the reasons that routes have become an increasingly popular marketing tool for tourism officials these days. These trails don't just benefit you, of course. Themed tourist trails are becoming an ever-more popular way to market destinations — to encourage visitors to check out lesser-known places and to linger a little longer. Often they are organized by tourism officials along with local government and business leaders and other groups interested in developing the economy of a region. The Fresno Fruit Trai ( www.gofruittrail.com ), for instance, was started as a way to help small-scale farmers in California gain another source of income by offering tours, pick-your-own or even bed-and-breakfast accommodations to tourists. It was a way to keep the family farm business alive. \nThat's why the United Nations' World Tourism Organization devoted much of its annual conference last year to tourist trails — they respond to the more enlightened goals of both travelers and tourism development. Today's travelers want more \"experiential\" and \"authentic\" opportunities to see the world, interacting with the locals and learning about their traditions. The trails lead them back from the big, famous and often lifeless repositories of history and art back to the places and people of its origins. \nThe trail idea isn't new, of course, Pilgrimage routes have been around for centuries. People have followed in the paths of famous explorers — the Lewis and Clark Trail, for instance. \nBut the ways the trails are set up and how we follow them are changing. Public relations companies are beginning to offer theme-route consultations. They not only work with locals to identify the unique and most valuable resources — history, art, crafts, geography — of their communities but also assure that trails offer other tourism amenities, like accommodations, rest stops, scenic overlooks, etc. \nNew types of technology are being used to help tell old stories. The Mason County Heritage Trail's newly established Barn Quilt Trails and Lumber Trail may bring you back to the old agricultural traditions of this area of northern Michigan, but you learn all about how to fell a tree or what life was like in a lumber camp from the privacy of your cellphone in both recorded and video programs. \nSome of these helpful trails, ironically, can still be hard to unearth. Aside from a few famous trails like the Silk Road and the Lewis and Clark Trail, they're not well known. But, as I discovered with a little research, many organizations have well-funded and established programs and have been researching and developing tourist trails for years — the Cultural Routes of Europe, for instance (see below). Only now is their work gaining attention, and in most cases, they're scrambling to come up with the maps, brochures and other materials modern tourists take for granted at destinations. \nBIG PLAYERS \nCultural Routes of Europe ( www.culture-routes.net ): It was designed as a unification strategy rather than a tourism-generating plan. It began gaining some traction in the 1980s, when the official Cultural Routes program of the Council of Europe was officially launched with a route based on the roads along which large numbers of pilgrims from all parts of Europe traveled to one of the foremost pilgrimage sites of the Middle Ages: the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela and the tomb of the Apostle James in Spain. It was not just a \"religious\" route, but offered insight into people and civilization and was the first \"pilgrimage\" theme of what is now half a dozen, with 29 routes in all, covering every country in the European Union. \nThe themes include: \n— The \"ways of pilgrimage\" theme: From its beginnings, the concept of hospitable networks (the Order of Cluny, the Knights of Malta or St John) has led to the development of a network of small businesses, initially religious, that federated agricultural and medical \"clusters\" to feed and care for pilgrims. Today, with the renaissance of pilgrimages, this spirit of hospitality and welcome has spawned resting points, hostels and semi-tourist accommodation facilities, creating an entire social economy linked to a social, supportive and ethical tourism. \n— The Via Regia: One of the oldest commercial exchange corridors in Europe. The route, which runs throughout Europe — from Spain in the West to Ukraine in the East, enables you to interpret the geography and nature of these exchanges and the creation of small and medium businesses from the age of peddlers to transportation via articulated trucks on the new east-west motorways built since World War II. \n— The Cultural Routes of industrial heritage: The Iron Route in the Pyrenees, primarily designed to present and interpret a network of small historic crafts enterprises that employed a cross-border seasonal workforce, and the European Iron Trail in Central Europe, showcasing the great industries of the region. \n— Landscapes and civilizations: The Routes of the Olive Tree and the Iter Vitis (The Ways of the Vine). Routes are particularly relevant models for studying the economy and management of landscape as well as the structure of small agricultural businesses before the development of the food-processing industry. \n— The European Route of Historical Thermal Towns: This is where wellness tourism began in places like Baden-Baden and Biarritz. It wasn't always about mani-pedis. \nThe National Scenic Byways Program, ( www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways ): Part of the Federal Highway Administration, the program is a grass-roots collaborative effort established to help recognize, preserve and enhance selected roads throughout the United States that are deemed especially significant based on one or more archeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational and scenic qualities. There are about 150 specially designated stretches of roadway in the system today. Over three weeks, I took several of these roads: the Lincoln Highway, the Historic National Road, Route 66, the Great River Road, Natchez Trace and a smidgen of the Blue Ridge Parkway. In 4,200 miles, the routes took me back to places of significance in America's history, the evolution of small towns, examples of remarkable engineering feats needed to make the roads in the first place. But most of all, these all-but-lost highways brought me to scenes of an America I thought had long been lost. \nBIG TRAILS International: \n— Bertha Benz Memorial Route ( www.bertha-benz.de ): Follow the route in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the tracks of the world's first long-distance road trip in 1888. On an August morning that year, Bertha Benz and her two teenage sons got in the car her husband, Carl, had newly built and headed from Mannheim to her hometown of Pforzheim. It was only 65 miles, but it took three days and was some adventure. Several bystanders were just frightened by the sight of it. The drive was very helpful for Carl Benz, as he was able to introduce several improvements after his wife reported what happened along the way, and she made important suggestions, including the introduction of an additional gear for climbing hills \n— Castle Road ( www.burgenstrasse.de ): Germany has a lot of themed driving routes because, well, it was and still is really into cars and driving. The original route of Castle Route was between Nuremberg to Bayreuth but has since been extended all the way to Prague, with some 90 castles, along the way. \n— Trail of the Eagle Nests ( http://orlegniazda.pl/en-US ): In southwestern Poland, this chain of 25 medieval castles between Czestochowa and Krakow is now a protected area known as the Eagle Nests Landscape Park. \n— Scotland's Malt Whisky Trail ( www.maltwhiskytrail.com ): Takes you through the rich scenery of rural Speyside to seven working distilleries, including Chivas Regal, Glenfiddich and Glenlivet. \n— Wild Atlantic Way ( www.wildatlanticway.com ): Dramatic seaside scenery, history and culture along 1,553 miles heading south on the western coast of Ireland from County Donegal's Inishowen Peninsula to Kinsale on the Celtic Sea in County Cork. \n— Rutes Tematiques: ( www.barcelonaturisme.com ): The culture-packed city of Barcelona has more than a dozen theme trails to help you organize your sightseeing. Among them are the Gaudi Route, Picasso Route, Ancient Roman Route, Medieval Route and, if you think these are just too obvious, the Josep Puig i Cadafalch Route (named for a politician who became president of Catalonia from 1917 to 1925. He was also an archaeologist and expert in Romanesque art and was influential in shaping the architecture of the city. \nIn the United States: \nWe follow our explorers and our history: \n— California Trail: The largest migration in history crossed this trail in the 1840s and 1850 to the rich farmland and gold fields of California, covering more than 1,000 miles. \n— Lewis and Clark Trail: The famous trail over 2,000 miles that led fur traders, trappers, missionaries and settlers west. \n— Oregon Trail-Pony Express Trail: The system of riding the mail from Missouri to California in only 10 days before the Civil War and the railroad. \n— Santa Fe Trail: Leading from western Missouri west through Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Oklahoma. \n— Trail of Tears: The 1830's trail of the forced migration of the Cherokee tribes west from the southeastern part of the United States. \nWe also like our spirits: \n— Wine, of course, is the main potable of pilgrimage. It put Napa and Sonoma on the map, after all, followed by the Finger Lakes Wine Trail in upstate New York. Now every state in the country produces wine, and every one of them has a wine trail. Wine trail associations encourage people to linger longer, see more of the area and, yes, spend more. Information: americaswinetrails.com. \n— Beer is coming up a strong second (who's left to drive?). Craft brew aficionados will find beer trails across the country, often backed by their states' craft brewers associations and tourism offices as they promote local business and help bring visitors to the area. The Delaware Ale Trail has partnered with the Delaware Tourism Office to showcase the growing craft beer industry in the state. The trail currently includes 13 breweries and works to promote the local beer-scene and show visitors what craft beer in Delaware has to offer. Many of these trails also have passport programs and offer a free gift after your pamphlet has been stamped at a certain number of breweries Info: craftbrews.com \nFor a good old brewery tour experience, go to brewtrail.com. There you'll find databases of breweries that offer tours and have taprooms and a search engine that lets you blaze your own trail. \n— In 1999, the Kentucky Distillers' Association formed the Kentucky Bourbon Trail tour to give visitors a firsthand look at the art and science of crafting Bourbon. In the past five years, nearly 2.5 million visitors from the U.S. and abroad have done the trail. A minimum of three days is recommended — more if you really enjoy it. Info: kybourbontrail.com. \nAnd our folk ways: \n— The White Lightning Trail of Tennessee ( www.tntrailsandbyways.com ): Not a spirit trail, though it's in there. It's a new, 200-mile motor route that starts in Knoxville and winds its way up the Clinch and Powell river valleys to Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. The route includes a drive along the Maynardville Highway, a main artery for running moonshine during Prohibition. But it also includes five state parks, 15 marinas and numerous craft shops and restaurants, circumnavigating the big cities for small towns in less-visited counties The White Lightning is the fourth in what eventually will be a system of 16 motor trails designed to showcase interesting and offbeat tourist attractions across the state through a program called Discover Tennessee Trails and Byways. \n— The Crooked Road ( www.crookedroad.org ): Subtitled Virginia's Heritage Music Trail, it is a 330-mile route from the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Coalfield region of Virginia, connecting eight major heritage music venues with a thriving network of jams, festivals and concerts in the communities along the way.
