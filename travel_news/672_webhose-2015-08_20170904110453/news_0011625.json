Today saw the public beta release on Android of the digital personal assistant that has been one of the key selling features of the Windows platform. In a move that follows on naturally from CEO Satya Nadella's 'cloud first, mobile first' strategy for the Redmond-based company, Cortana provides easy access to Bing's search engine for web searches and associated personal information as well as working with cloud-based tasks across various machines, and setting a mix of alarms and reminders.But it's the search portion of Cortana that is key to Microsoft. The modern internet is driven by search, and advertising around search is a key income stream for many companies including Microsoft. The more search queries that Microsoft can process, the better for its bottom line. If Cortana can bring more search to Microsoft whole diminishing Google searches on Android devices, then Microsoft strengthens its portfolio while weakening a competitor.[caption id=\"attachment_19656\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Microsoft advertises OneNote's cloud capability (image: Microsoft.com)[/caption]Cortana is not yet fully integrated with Android - while you can set up Cortana to be launched by the home key you can't say a crisp \"Hey Cortana!\" to open the application and accept voice input in the same manner as you can on a Windows device. That may come in time, but for the moment Microsoft is working to gain knowledge of Android itself, Android users' habits, and how best to bring part of Google's platform close enough to Microsoft's own cloud to allow users to become established with a Microsoft account. (and a similar pattern can be seen on iOS).Cortana is a powerful brand for Microsoft thanks to the association with Halo and the gaming crowd, but also through the marketing efforts in the last twelve months around its inclusion on Microsoft Windows. With the launch of Windows 10, Cortana has been pushed further into the limelight, and it should come as no surprise to see its latest push take it into the enemy territory of Android. Microsoft has already made some impressive software moves on Android (and iOS) during 2015 . The release of Outlook for Android and iOS brought a powerful email client and PIM manager to both platforms that has proven popular with many users (including myself). Clients for the cloud-based versions of the core Office apps (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint) allow Microsoft to challenge Google Docs and Apple's own office apps on the platform while providing easy integration to enterprise clients who are heavily invested in the Microsoft offerings. And the flexibility of OneNote across multiple platforms still makes it one of the first note-taking clients that I reach for.[caption id=\"attachment_15847\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Microsoft Surface Pro 3 (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]Nadella's vision does feel at some points like a cuckoo strategy - planting the eggs of Microsoft's cloud in the operating system nest of another company, but with Windows Phone not following the early market share success of Windows Mobile in the US, it has been left with little choice. It's not alone in hoping that Android and iOS can provide a welcoming enough platform to boost a third-party product, but it's certainly one of the best financed operations. You can be sure that this is not the last we'll hear of Microsoft products running on a competitor's platform.Microsoft failed to establish an OS for the mobile generation, but it is making up for that in software that is almost platform neutral. If you have a mobile device, you can interface with Microsoft's cloud.... and at some point you'll be monetized through advertising, through purchasing extra storage space (on OneDrive) or purchasing additional features (such as the premium Office 365 subscription).Cortana on Android is just one more way for Microsoft to bring the mobile audience's eyes back to Redmond.[gallery2012]( Now read about the Surface range of computers, and if they should be considered a success for Microsoft ).", "external_links": ["http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/08/24/cortana-now-available-on-android-in-public-beta/", "https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.microsoft.cortana"], "published": "2015-08-25T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:13:18.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
