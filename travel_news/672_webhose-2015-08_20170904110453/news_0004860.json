The hotels will join more than 35 properties trading or in development under Hilton Worldwide brands in Germany and Austria, of which 13 are within its focused service Hampton by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn brands.\nPatrick Fitzgibbon, senior vice president, development, Europe & Africa, Hilton Worldwide, said: “Signing Hampton by Hilton Berlin Alexanderplatz with Primestar Hospitality earlier this year paved the way for a collaboration of scale in Germany and Austria. Primestar’s market knowledge and strategic growth plans give us an enhanced development platform across core German speaking countries, and this agreement promises further penetration in markets which together attract more than 150 million overnight stays per year.”1\nThe properties will be newly constructed, city centre developments, in population hubs with robust business and leisure demand. Operating as franchised hotels, Primestar Hospitality will manage the portfolio.Wolfgang Gallas is Director, Primestar Hospitality, and was previously Development Director for Germany and Austria, Hilton Worldwide. Commenting on the agreement, he said, “I have witnessed firsthand the strength of Hampton by Hilton, both in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Primestar’s ambitions to operate in excess of 10 hotels in Germany and Austria in the coming years will be realized by selecting prime urban locations, such as the already confirmed Berlin Alexanderplatz.”\nHampton by Hilton recently opened a new hotel in Nuremburg City Centre, and has a presence in Berlin with Hampton by Hilton Berlin City West – a hotel which has thrived since welcoming its first guests in 2010. Guests staying at any Hampton by Hilton hotel can expect complimentary WiFi as standard, and a hot breakfast included in the room rate. Each hotel delivers a fresh, modern aesthetic, infused with local photography and artwork, highlighting each property’s connection to its local area.\nPhil Cordell, global head, focused service and Hampton brand management, Hilton Worldwide, said, “Hampton by Hilton’s unprecedented growth in Europe has led to a portfolio of approaching 100 hotels trading or under development across the continent. Primestar’s development expertise will focus on introducing focused service hotels in urban centers across Germany and Austria, and build on Hilton’s long standing reputation in Central Europe.”\nHilton Worldwide and Primestar Hospitality are considering opportunities across Germany and Austria, with Hampton by Hilton Berlin Alexanderplatz the first location to be revealed.\nSource:- Hilton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:01:10.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
