NEW YORK — Citigroup agreed to pay almost $180m to settle a US regulator’s allegations that it defrauded wealthy clients of two failed hedge funds by telling them the investments were as safe as low-risk municipal bonds.\nCitigroup units made false and misleading statements on the funds, which raised almost $3bn from 2002 to 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Monday.\nWhen the funds collapsed in 2008, the bank had not told many clients an internal rating showed the investments posed significant risks to principal, and had failed to disclose that one of the funds was seeking an emergency loan.\n\"Advisers at these … affiliates were supposed to be looking out for investors’ best interests but falsely assured them they were making safe investments even when the funds were on the brink of disaster,\" said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division.\nThe funds sought to exploit yield differences between US government debt and municipal bonds, and used borrowed money to amplify those bets. The bank pushed clients into the funds even into the second half of 2007 when they began experiencing margin calls and liquidity problems, the SEC said.\nIn settling, Citigroup neither admitted nor denied the allegations. \"We are pleased to have resolved this matter,\" spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said in an e-mailed statement.\nCitigroup pitched the investment as a \"better version of a bond\" and instructed some clients to sell unleveraged fixed-income portfolios to buy into the investment, according to the SEC.\nIn addition to the SEC action, the US justice department is looking into Citigroup’s dealings with companies linked to Mexican billionaire Carlos Hank Rhon as part of a probe of the bank’s money-laundering controls.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:56:23.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
