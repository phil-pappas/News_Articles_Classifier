It was a large punnet of Californian strawberries, courtesy of a supplier of ice-cream parlours. “This is the future,” he declared. “Strawberries in January.” I was sceptical but curious because strawberries were, and still are, my very favourite fruit. When I prep them at work I smell each one, and even in the supermarket aisle I have been known to get lost in their scent – hints of roses, cloves and, strangely, pineapple. My favourite wine, old red burgundy , has the same aroma, with the added notes of mulchy farmyard and vanilla. •James Wong: how to grow the best tasting strawberries I love the versatility of strawberries: they make gorgeous milkshakes when whizzed with a bit of milk and vanilla ice cream and one of the best ice creams we make at The Sportsman is our simple strawberry flavour. I take the whole fruit – green top included – some crème fraîche and sugar syrup and blitz them together in a blender. I want the ice cream to taste like you are biting into a lovely ripe strawberry, so I exaggerate the flavour to fight through the neutrality of the cream and sugar syrup by adding a splash of rosewater, some lime syrup and sesame oil. Rose and lime might make sense to most, but sesame always seems to throw people – in fact, the seeds on the outside give a hint of nuttiness which is intensified by the oil. I think it also explains why they go so well with shortbread and cake. High harvests: picking strawberries used to be back-breaking work, so thank goodness for the polytunnel Photo: ALAMY High harvests: picking strawberries used to be back-breaking work, so thank goodness for the polytunnel, Copyright: ALAMY My favourite variety is currently the 'Driscoll Jubilee’, which has a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity as well as great fragrance. But if you struggle to find the best berries, this week’s recipe, which involves gently warming them, is a great way to bring out the sweetness in slightly insipid fruit. \"The countryside is more than a pretty place for us to coo over\" Happily for us strawberry fiends, their season has now been extended by the arrival of the polytunnel and is now with us from May all the way through to September. Polytunnels , hated by many, call into question our relationship with the countryside as, unlike wind turbines, I have never heard anyone extolling the beauty of a polytunnel – although I’ve always liked the way they seem to glisten and wink at you if you ever fly over Kent. I do have great sympathy for anybody who has seen their view change from rolling hills to polythene fields but the countryside is more than a pretty landscape for us to coo over. •Top polytunnel tips for beginners Polytunnels have brought consistency and sweetness to harvests, a reliable income for farmers – and less back-breaking work for pickers. Many years ago, I managed just two days picking on a scorching hill by the side of the Thanet Way near Whitstable but even I could manage the easy-to-reach tabletop crops now. But I must admit that I miss the old rhythm of the seasons, when the first fruit would arrive in time for Wimbledon and the Lord’s Test match, signalling the arrival of high summer. I also relished that second hit in mid-August, which I suspected might have been a false memory until a fruit farmer confirmed the existence of a 60-day crop. A fast-growing variety such as 'Elsanta’ was planted in May and ready to pick in August. As a child, this second burst symbolised summer’s last throw of the dice – after that, the fruits in season were autumnal. Apple and blackberry crumble or plum cobbler were a just reward for the knowledge that the nights are drawing in. So, what about those Californian strawberries? I remember being disappointed: they were watery and lacked the dense texture and intense flavour of their best English counterparts. Maybe I wasn’t the extreme seasonalist I am now, but I knew even then there was something wrong with strawberries in January.
