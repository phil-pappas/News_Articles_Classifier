Ford International Airport and a destination in the Southeast U.S. \nAllegiant Air announced this morning that it will bring back service from Grand Rapids to Punta Gorda, Fla., beginning on Nov. 4. \n“We’re pleased to once again provide Grand Rapids travelers the opportunity to affordably vacation in southwest Florida,” said Jude Bricker, SVP of planning, Allegiant Travel Company. \nNon-stop flights \nThe flights will operate twice weekly and fly non-stop between Gerald R. Ford International Airport , or GRR, and Punta Gorda Airport , or PGD. \nFlight days, times and the lowest fares can be found only at Allegiant.com . \nFlorida service \nPunta Gorda offers access to the Fort Myers, Sanibel and Captiva Island areas, “a popular vacation spot for many Michiganders,” according to Brian Ryks, Ford airport executive director. \nPunta Gorda will be the sixth destination Allegiant offers out of Grand Rapids. \nStrong demand in the Grand Rapids market has spurred Allegiant to add more low-cost flights for travelers, including its recently announced service to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which begins Dec. 16. \n“The community has enthusiastically responded to our latest Florida flights, and we are confident that we will see the same response to our Punta Gorda service,” Bricker said. \nPromotional rate \nAs part of the rollout of the Punta Gorda service, Allegiant is offering one-way fares from $49 on a limited number of seats. \nThe promotional rate is only good for certain flights that are purchased by Aug. 14 for travel by Feb. 16, 2016. \nAllegiant \nLas Vegas-based Allegiant , founded in 1997, has grown from one plane and one route to offering access to low-cost flights in more than 100 cities nationwide, more than any other domestic low-cost carrier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:11:55.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
