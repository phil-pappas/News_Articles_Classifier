Sayari Camp \nPioneering the spectacular, un-spoilt northern Serengeti area, the award-winning Sayari Camp has become synonymous with some of the most dramatic sights that Africa has to offer: The Great Migration crossing the Mara River, incredible crocodile and hippo action, along with the undisturbed wildlife viewing that the northern Serengeti has in abundance. The Great Migration typically camps in this area from mid-July to early November. Not only do guests of Sayari Camp witness the spectacle of the Mara River crossing, their experience is enhanced by the exclusivity of this remote area. Outside of the Migration season , the camp offers what is arguably an even greater experience: a private concession-like, completely uninterrupted encounter with the Serengeti and all its non-Migratory inhabitants: big cats, elephants, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, rhino, groups of numerous large antelopes and many other exceptional animals. Sayari Camp compliments its environment perfectly, offering memorable impressions by road or on foot. The stunning camp features spacious rooms with panoramic views of the never-ending plains.

Serengeti Migration Camp \nThis camp’s name is apt - it is located, after all, right on the main migration route between the Serengeti and the Masai Mara, where nearly 2 million wildebeest, zebra and gazelle annually make their way up north. This natural spectacle has taken place since time immemorial, and Migration Camp is the perfect spot to witness this perpetual marvel which unfolds within sight of the camp during the months when the herds pass through this region (July through November). The 20 en-suite tents are expansive and luxuriously furnished, including leather seats and a writing desk as well as a flushing toilet, shower and a twin vanity basin with hot and cold running water. Each has a balcony with two rocking chairs, so that guests can relax and soak in the grandeur of this legendary setting. Game drives here certainly do not disappoint; in addition to the migration , the area is well known as an outstanding place to spy a wide range of mammals including lion, leopard and elephant. The main lodge is built to maximize the visual impact of the rugged landscape, whether you’re chatting about the day’s exploits at the cigar bar, taking a dip in the pool or sipping Serengeti sundowners. And of course, the bush cuisine here is sure to delight your palate with an array of local tastes and some fun venues, including al fresco picnic lunches or barbeques around the campfire. \nFor travel from December to June, check out Pioneer Camp for a better setting to witness the migration and on par with its sister camp for romantic luxury. More » Lamai 5. Lamai Serengeti \nLamai Serengeti sits tucked amongst the rocks of Kogakuria Kopje with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, just a few miles from where the wildebeest cross the Mara River . For roughly a quarter of the year, between late July and October, this is where you'll find the migration . Each of the rooms is designed to fit into the complex geometry of the kopje and to make the most of this sensational location, its views and its natural space and light. At Lamai Serengeti there are just 12 rooms in all. These are split between two entirely separate lodges, the Main Lodge of 8 rooms and the smaller Private Lodge of 4 rooms. The rooms are a clever blend of canvas, plaster and natural poles. Throughout the year, not only can you use our 4x4 s to explore the intricacies of the area, both south of the Mara River and (river state permitting) to the north, but walking safaris are on offer here. The topography lends itself well to being on your feet; small valleys, river lines and rocky kopjes make for frequent changes of scenery...and great cover for approaching wild animals unseen More » Singita 6. Singita Sabora Tented Camp \nSingita Sabora Tented Camp Antique mahogany travel chests, Persian rugs, silk curtains - your accommodations at Singita Sabora Tented Camp offer the lavish appointments generally reserved for five-star urban hotels. Yet here, you are in the midst of one of the world’s legendary wide-open wildernesses: the Serengeti. The nine elegant tents are decked out in a charming, 1920s style and feature a bedroom and reading area, bathroom with tub and outdoor shower and a viewing deck with your own Swarovski spotting scope. There are plenty of activities to enjoy while you’re here - archery, stargazing safaris, mountain biking and tennis - yet it is the wildlife that draws guest here. Set off on twice daily game drives, or explore from a different perspective: either soar above the sweeping plains on an optional hot-air balloon ride, or head to the nearby Equestrian Center to discover the area on horseback. Back at camp, you can unwind with a book in the library/ lounge tent, go for a swim in the pool, and enjoy a sundowner as you gaze out at the wildlife-rich waterhole. The superb feasts are another pleasant part of your day here. Made with locally grown organic produce and coupled with vintage wines, meals can be enjoyed in the charming dining room at camp, or out in the wilds: by a lamp-lit acacia, perhaps, or under the boughs of a large ‘Sausage’ tree with starlit skies above you.
