Pictured: a crowded beach in Barcelona, Spain\nAn investigation into the effects of climate change, made by the European Commission, predicted an end to Brits' Mediterranean exodus, in favour of locations such as the Balkans.\nThe experts also predict that if British holidaymakers do still opt to vacation in southern Europe, the trips will be shorter and during the off-season to avoid the sweltering heat.\n The humble package holiday's surprisingly upper-class...

According to the study, Spain and Bulgaria will likely be hit worst by the effects of climate change.\nMeanwhile, resorts in Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia and Slovakia are likely to benefit most.\n'One could expect tourists would distribute their holiday pattern more evenly during the year and take shorter holidays in order to benefit, for instance, from more clement weather conditions during the other seasons,' the report reads.\nInstead, the EU report believes that the Balkans will rise in popularity, in particular the beaches in Estonia (pictured) and Latvia\nThese findings by the EU's Joint Research Centre are based on the larger trend of rising global temperatures, which are expected to increase by 2C by the end of the century.\nIt also analyses the potential impact of climate change on tourism demand in the EU and provides long-term projections - through 2100 - accounting for climate adaptation in terms of holiday duration and frequency.\nUltimately, tourism revenues in these warm-climate countries could be slashed by up to 0.45 per cent of GDP per year, while the north of the continent would gain by as much as 0.32 per cent.\nThis would undoubtedly shock those who live in the Mediterranean year round, as many people's livelihoods rely on the influx of tourists each summer.\nRead more: ec.europa.eu/jrc...", "external_links": ["https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/climate-change-lower-revenues-mediterranean-regions", "http://dailym.ai/1WpE5PQ"], "published": "2015-08-15T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T05:25:56.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
