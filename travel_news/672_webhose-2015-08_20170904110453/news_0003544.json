Located in the heart of historic Harrogate, and on the doorstep of the spectacular Yorkshire Dales, the Yorkshire Hotel has introduced 107 brand new beds for its 81 standard, feature and signature rooms \nMeasured lengthways, the beds would reach an incredible 214 metres approximately in distance - well over the length of the local Harrogate Rugby Union’s large pitch. The beds would easily fill the newly developed Queen’s Suite at the Harrogate International Centre and, if stacked on top of one another, scale the height of the historic Ripley Castle tower. After some intensive and exhaustive testing, including a ‘bounce test’ and ‘story time test’, by dedicated members of the hotel’s team, the perfect combination of comfort and firmness was established. The new bed frames, mattresses and linen have been delivered and an eight person strong housekeeping team will tirelessly prepare the new beds for hotel guests to enjoy their slumber in style. The hotel is confident that guests will have a great night’s sleep once all the beds are in place. Rob Warren, General Manager of the Yorkshire Hotel, commented: “Guaranteeing a comfy and cosy stay, along with an exceptional and memorable experience is what we strive to offer each and every customer. We hope our investment in over 100 new beds will provide even more of a homely feel and ensure a restful and relaxing sleep all round. The only pitfall is that guests may not want to get out of bed!” The Yorkshire Hotel, part of the Crieff Hydro Family of Hotels, is a traditional town-centre hotel offering an ideal base for leisure, travel trade and business customers. As well as having 81 bedrooms of varying configurations, the Hotel has five meeting rooms, a restaurant serving local favourites, a rooftop function space, and a bar.
