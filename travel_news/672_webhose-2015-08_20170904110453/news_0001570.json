The 200,000 passengers-per-day level was exceeded a total of 17 days in July 2015. Furthermore, on July 31, FRA registered a new daily record of 216,732 passengers - overtaking the previous peak day in September 2014 by nearly 2,800 passengers. In addition, the number of passengers per flight at FRA hit an all-time high of 152.4 passengers (up 4.6 percent year-on-year). The number of aircraft movements grew by two percent year-on-year to 43,710, another historic record at Frankfurt Airport.

In 2014, the Fraport Group generated sales of €2.4 billion and profit of about €252 million.

For the current summer timetable, FRA is served by 104 passenger airlines flying to some 297 destinations in 104 countries worldwide. More than half of FRA's destinations are intercontinental (beyond Europe) - underscoring Frankfurt's role as a leading hub in the global air transportation system. In Europe, Frankfurt Airport ranks first in terms of cargo tonnage and is the third-busiest for passenger traffic. With about 55 percent of all passengers using Frankfurt as a connecting hub, FRA also has the highest transfer rate among the major European hubs. \nFrankfurt Airport City has become Germany's largest job complex at a single location, employing more than 80,000 people at some 500 companies and organizations on site. Major new real estate developments - such as The Squaire, the Gateway Gardens business park, and the Mönchhof Logistics Park - are creating an exciting new dimension and range of services at the evolving Frankfurt Airport City of the 21st century. \nAlmost half of Germany's population lives within a 200-kilometer radius of the FRA intermodal travel hub - the largest airport catchment area in Europe. FRA Airport City also serves as a magnet for other companies located throughout the economically vital Frankfurt/Rhine-Main-Neckar region. Thanks to synergies associated with the region's dynamic industries, networked expertise, and outstanding intermodal transportation infrastructure, FRA's world route network enables Hesse's and Germany's export-oriented businesses to flourish in global growth markets. \nFrankfurt Airport meets the increasing needs of the export-oriented economies of the State of Hesse as well as Germany as a whole, for optimal connections to growth markets around the globe. Likewise, FRA is a strategic gateway for companies wanting to access the huge European marketplace. Thus, Frankfurt Airport - which is strategically located in the heart of Europe - is one of the most important hubs in the global logistics chain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:38:41.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
