The Burlington County Bridge Commission approved the increase in a Wednesday meeting, doubling the tolls for motorists who pay cash to cross the Tacony-Palmyra and Burlington-Bristol bridges, according to 6ABC.com . The tolls rise from $2 to $4 for drivers who pay cash. Tolls for E-Z Pass users increases by $1. The increases start September 15th. The additional funds will be put towards improvements on the two bridges, officials said. Elsewhere in the Garden State, commuters who cross four other bridges that are operated by the Delaware River Port Authority – Ben Franklin, Walt Whitman, Betsy Ross and Commodore Barry – will get a discount on tolls starting later this year. Last month, the DRPA board approved the $18 monthly discount , which applies to drivers who travel across those four bridges at least 18 times per month and pay with E-Z Pass. \nWant Philadelphia Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T15:40:49.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
