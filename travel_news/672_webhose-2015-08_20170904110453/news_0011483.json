Contiki, the world leader of youth travel for 18 to 35’s just teamed up with legendary YouTube star Devin Supertramp to make a traveller’s dream come true by capturing and jumping off some pretty epic cliff spots in Italy! Devin is an American videographer who produces adventure and extreme sport videos, and some of his incredible stunt videos to date include zip-lining between skyscrapers in Dubai, making a huge human sling shot and wingsuit racing at 140MPH.\nTake at a look at 8 of the most legendary cliff diving spots around the world. Something to think about for 2016. Only if you dare.\nFURORE BRIDGE, FURORE, ITALY\nFurore, locally called Neverland, is a small settlement on the flanks of an Amalfi mountain, overlooking the sea with a small village on the steep cliffs of a Fjord. The Fjord of Furore is easily one of the most striking things about the area, where the water erosion has created stunning cliffs that overhanging the ocean. The Furore Bridge is an overhanging arched bridge that the state road runs across and where Diving Championships are held annually. The jump itself is 90 foot, and well worth a visit for seasoned cliff divers and adrenaline junkies alike.\nCRATER LAKE, CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK, OREGON\nCrater Lake in Oregon National Park is the deepest lake in the USA, so unless your cannonballs are likely to make you sink to 2000ft you don’t need to worry about hitting bottom. That’s said, the water is pretty cold so be prepared to lose your breath when you enter the water! The National Park Service may frown upon diving here, so if you’re planning a jump make sure to pre-plan your exit route.\nTHE AZURE WINDOW, GOZO, MALTA\nThe Azure Window is a natural arch on the Maltese island of Gozo that was formed after two Limestone Sea caves collapsed. Popular with cliff divers for obvious reasons this 92 foot high arch consists of yellow to pale-grey limestone, and was even used as a location in season one of Game of Thrones. With its equally beautiful and daunting appearance, high drop and deep blue water the Azure Window is a must for all cliff diving enthusiasts.\nGEOJE ISLAND, SOUTH KOREA\nSouth Korea is not usually a country associated with high-octane, high adrenaline activities like Cliff Diving. However if you travel a couple hours southwest of Busan to arrive at Geoje Island you can have your pick of impressive granite rock faces to throw yourself from. Geoje Island is definitely worth a visit if you’re in that part of the world.\nLAKE VOULIAGMENI, GREECE\nJust a stone’s throw away from Athens’ city centre is Lake Vouliagmeni. This amazing spot, locally referred to as ‘Sunken Lake’, maintains a constant 24°C water temperature all year round and is said to be haunted by numerous mystical stories about creatures, whirlpools and hidden treasures. Connected to the Mediterranean Sea by a maze of underwater caves, this healing lake is an ideal spot for cliff divers who want the exhilaration of an epic cliff dive without the shock of cold water at the end.\nRICK’S BAR, NEGRIL, JAMAICA\n“Whoever decided to put a bar at one of the best cliff diving spots in Jamaica was both a fool and a genius.” This pretty much sums up the epic cliff dive at this tourist bar in Negril, Jamaica. Brave tourists, locals and seasoned divers all encircle the top of this dive spot and encourage each other to dive into the ocean. The highest cliff is about 35 feet, so this dive may not provide the adrenaline rush that more experienced divers are searching for, but onlookers may catch some very brave locals making risky and daring dives from the tops of trees on the actual cliff. Rick’s Bar is definitely a must visit top Cliff Diving location to visit while in Jamaica.\nSTARI MOST, MOSTAR, BOSNIA\nNestled in the centre of the Bosnian city of Mostar is the Stari Most or Old Bridge, over the river Neretva, where for decades locals and tourists alike have jumped into the freezing water to the adoration of those on the banks of the river below. Stricter restrictions in recent years have made it harder for tourists to jump here but for around €35 the Mostar Diving Club will train you to jump off the bridge. The training starts with a few practice jumps off a 10m platform in sight of the Old Bridge, then once they deem you to be ready you’re escorted to the top of the bridge to prepare for the 89 foot jump.\nSource: Contiki", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T11:15:24.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
