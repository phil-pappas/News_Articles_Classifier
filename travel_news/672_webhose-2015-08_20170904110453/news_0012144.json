As the tool evolves, they'll also be able to proactively provide customers with the status of down-line flights and connecting gate information. \n\"We'll continue to enhance the device and Guest Service Tool to take advantage of customer-provided data to further personalize the on board experience,\" said Ausband. \"Eventually, flight attendants will be able to deliver food and beverage options that meet customer preferences and better identify those customers who may have had a previous disruption in their travel, all in an effort to deepen engagement with those who fly with us.\" \nWhen Delta provided its flight attendants with the sleek Lumia 1520 phablet device last year, it was with the intention of reducing Delta's environmental impact and reliance on paper materials. \nBeginning Sept. 1, the 500-page, 5-pound On Board Manual containing safety and service materials will be loaded on to their device, saving 55 tons of paper annually and reducing the airline's carbon footprint by 1,800 metric tons annuallyâ€”the equivalent of removing more than 370 passenger vehicles from the road. \nThe move to advance technology in the cabin comes on the heels of Delta's industry-leading initiative to equip its nearly 12,000 pilots with innovative Microsoft Surface Tablets to be used as an electronic flight bag as well as enterprise connectivity tool to improve efficiency and reduce pilot workload.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:34:03.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
