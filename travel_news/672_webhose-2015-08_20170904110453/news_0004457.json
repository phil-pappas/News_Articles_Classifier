For those who aim to sidestep citywide gridlock by instead walking, jogging or cycling home, some encouragement comes in the form of a newly released London Underground map which allows travellers to estimate how many calories they can burn while doing so. Click below to enlarge the map Interactive: TubeMap_CarlorieCount Developed by the healthcare website Treated.com in collaboration with GP Wayne Osborne, the map assumes that the average person will burn just under four calories per minute of walking, equalling about 60 calories per quarter hour. More effective exercise, jogging at a speed of six miles per hour, burns between 10 and 12 calories per minute; cycling, meanwhile, burns about seven calories per minute. Time until Tube strike begins • How will the Tube strike affect me? Once the distance between Tube stops has been taken into consideration, the map shows commuters approximately how many calories they will burn by walking home along the route they usually travel by Tube. The map shows how many calories are burned if walking between two consecutive stops; commuters walking between one or more stops can add the amounts together to calculate the complete number of calories they would burn by walking along their route home rather than travelling by Tube as usual. The total number of calories that commuters would burn if they jogged or cycled home on different routes are presented in the tables below. The tight cluster of Tube stations within central London predictably means this is the part of the city where the fewest calories are burnt between stops. It would take the least amount of time to walk between Charing Cross and Embankment or Aldgate East and Whitechapel – just two minutes apiece, or an output of eight calories. The same journey would take one minute to jog (12 calories). Other short journeys include Leicester Square to Piccadilly Circus (a five-minute walk); Marylebone to Baker Street (five minutes); and Hyde Park Corner to Knightsbridge (six minutes). It’s typically as commuters make their way along routes in outer London that the distances to tackle between stops, and the commensurate calories burned, become sizeable. Walking towards the city centre along the Metropolitan line route from Zone 4 Wembley Park to the next station, Zone 2’s Finchley Road, would take 100 minutes and burn 384 calories. • How can I get around London during the strike? Jogging the same route would take 50 minutes and burn 600 calories, while cycling that distance would take 31 minutes and burn 217 calories. Excluding the Waterloo and City line, which has only two stops and would take 32 minutes to walk, the 32-station Metropolitan line is the Tube line with the longest average minute count between stops, at 28.4 minutes. Unexpectedly, perhaps, with the Tube out of service, the longest route to walk would be between North Greenwich and Canning Town. The eight-minute Tube journey takes 108 minutes by foot and demands 415 calories as the Thames obstructs direct passage. (Commuters who didn’t wish to tackle such a convoluted route by foot could, however, use the nearby Emirates Air Line , which will run throughout the Tube strike, should they wish to create a shortcut.) • The best hotels in central London That anomaly does suggest some shortcomings with the map, with Londoners who occasionally walk parts of the Tube route perhaps able to suggest shortcuts and alternative means of travelling between two points. Another Tube map that will prove of interest to Londoners is Transport for London’s new Night Tube map , detailing which routes and stations will be served when the Night Tube is expected to commence services over entire weekends from September 2015 onwards. It is disputes over the working conditions TfL workers will be expected to comply with when those services start that is behind the current series of Tube strikes.
