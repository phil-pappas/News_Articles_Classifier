I-84 was closed last night, and many travelers stranded. Our rest area at Weatherby lost power, so our crew placed portable facilities for those in search of relief. Thank you to our many rest area travelers who may have found supplies running short, as hundreds of motorists were stopped. The photo is from the Weatherby Rest Area this morning, where everything is smooth sailing. But please be aware that not all fires are contained within the corridor moving from the border at Ontario up to about 7 miles east of Pendleton. Check TripCheck.com for the most up-to-date freeway information. \nGovernment Camp Rest Area may experience intermittent closures \nOn Thursday, August 6th, there will be water and sewer repairs taking place along Hwy 26, leading up to the rest area. Once the repair crews reach our rest area building, there will be closure signs placed in front of the restroomsâ€”there will be no water in the lines for flushing or hand-washing. \nThe closures will occur once in the morning and once in the afternoon. The parking lot will remain open for vehicles to pull into, so that travelers can stretch their legs or take a catnap. Two porta-potties will be placed in the parking lot for your convenience.
