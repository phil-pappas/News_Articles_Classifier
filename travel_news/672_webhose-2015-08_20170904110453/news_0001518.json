For May alone, CEB carried 11,018 passengers, 42% more than the next largest airline on the route, according to the latest statistics of Australia’s Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport, and Regional Economics (BITRE). \nCEB began operating four times weekly non-stop flights to Sydney on September 9, 2014, and added a fifth frequency after three months. The airline is the only low-cost carrier operating the route. \nFrom September 2014 to May 2015, BITRE reported a 62% year-on-year increase in passenger traffic between Manila and Sydney. During this nine-month period there were 232,876 passengers on the route. CEB flew 85,264 passengers or 37% of total passenger traffic. \nCargo volume on the Manila – Sydney route also grew by 33% from September 2014 to May 2015, compared to the same period in the previous year. \n“The significant passenger and cargo volume growth between Manila and Sydney validates the Cebu Pacific effect. CEB's low fares continue to drive trade and tourism between our countries. We look forward to offering the most affordable fares to even more destinations in Australia in the coming months,” said Alex Reyes, CEB General Manager for Long Haul Division. \nCEB's flights to Sydney utilize the airline's brand-new Airbus A330-300 fleet with a configuration of 436 all-economy class seats. \nCEB's 55-strong fleet is comprised of 10 Airbus A319, 31 Airbus A320, 6 Airbus A330 and 8 ATR 72-500 aircraft. It is one of the most modern aircraft fleets in the world. Between 2015 and 2021, CEB will take delivery of 7 more brand-new Airbus A320, 30 Airbus A321neo, and 16 ATR 72-600 aircraft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:52:01.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
