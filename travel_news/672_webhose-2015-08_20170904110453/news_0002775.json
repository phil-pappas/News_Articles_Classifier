New York to Rome to London to Rome to Milan to Madrid to London to New York and then New York to Mexico City to Sao Paolo to Los Angeles and back to New York. \nOver 12 flights! Say what ?! \nOn each and every flight, when the flights attendants rolled their carts down the aisle, no matter the airline, I thought of one particular friend of mine -- my friend who loves airline food. \nAirline food! Say what ?! \nI have to admit: I totally get it because I secretly love airline food too. \nIt's not the taste, and it's also not the plate presentation. If you've ever had a dinner in our house, then you'll discover real taste and amazing plate presentation (not that I can take any credit.) \nTo be honest, it's not the service either. Let's face it, with no offense to anyone, the service can be a bit of a crapshoot. Sorry. \nNo, none of those are reasons to love airline food. \nFor me it's the destination that makes me love airline food. \nWhen I'm getting on a plane, I am going someplace. I'm going to work with colleagues, meet with clients or pitch exciting new business. Once in awhile I'm going on a vacation. And half of the time I'm coming home, in theory anyway. \nSo when that tray is put in front of me, no matter what state it's in or what state we are flying over, I think of where I'm going. And that's pretty exciting. \nFor my friend, this started young since he traveled with his family quite a bit from one cool destination to another. For that young boy, airline food meant he was going someplace fun. \nFor me, it started as an adult, but it's still the same emotion. \nSo the next time you start to grumble about how horrible the airplane food it, remember the point of your flight. \nYou are going someplace, so enjoy the ride. Tray, cart, and wrapped up utensils and all. \nFollow Jim Joseph on Twitter: www.twitter.com/@outandaboutdad More: Airline Food Customer Service This Blogger's Books and Other Items from...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:33:48.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
