Today over 70% of 911 calls come from mobile devices, but approximately 60% of those calls cannot be accurately located . A 2013 study cited by the FCC in 2014 estimated that over 10,000 lives could be saved annually if mobile calls had better location data. Advanced technology platform will be able to predict emergencies before they occur, dynamically warn people in harm's way, and ensure that first responders are always one touch away globally Founding team members were each touched by personal experiences with 911 failure - led team to work with over 150 dispatch centers globally to build the technology $5M Financing led by Highland Capital Partners brings together a historic group of VCs, technology pioneers, and billionaire investors One of the most award-winning student start-ups in Harvard / MIT history - RapidSOS has won major start-up competitions across the U.S. \"Technology has dramatically changed our lives over the last 50 years, except for when we need it most,\" said RapidSOS Founder and CEO Michael Martin . \"We are very happy to announce that we are partnering with the 911 community and some of the world's most successful technologists and investors to bringing the 911 system to the 21 st century.\" RapidSOS is building out an advanced suite of technologies for emergency prevention, management, and communication. \"We are working on ways to predict and preempt emergencies before they occur, warn people in harm's way, and ensure that first responders are always one-touch away globally,\" said Nick Horelik , RapidSOS CTO, who co-founded the company with Martin out of MIT. RapidSOS' first product, One-Touch-911 , will be launched later this year and serves as a universal data pipeline from any connected device to first responders. The system interfaces seamlessly with dispatch centers in over 135 countries - transmitting unprecedented data from a user's phone directly to dispatchers in an emergency. \"We could not be more excited about our investment in RapidSOS. Current mobile 911 technology is broken; RapidSOS' solution will have mass appeal and ultimately save thousands of lives,\" said Dan Nova , Partner at Highland Capital Partners who led the financing round and will be joining the company's board. \" Michael Martin is an exceptional mission-driven entrepreneur, and we look forward to helping the team build a company of significant consequence.\" RapidSOS was founded in 2013 by Michael Martin ( Harvard Business School '15) and Nick Horelik (MIT PhD Nuclear Engineering '15), after each had personal experiences around 911 failure. Martin's father, Charles Martin , fell off the roof of their childhood home while trying to clear snow and was unable to reach 911 through his cell phone. Horelik staffed the suicide prevention hotline during undergrad at Tufts University , where the biggest challenge was locating students in need. \"RapidSOS has developed technology to improve our antiquated 911 system by intelligently and reliably connecting users to first responders wherever they are,\" said Doug Romanoff , a member of the Two Sigma Ventures Investment Team . \"We are proud to be investing in the company, which fits squarely within our focus on supporting entrepreneurs that are pioneering innovations in data science and related technologies to transform industries.\" RapidSOS' technology platform is the product of over two years of development work in partnership with the 911 community. \"We are so grateful to the 911 community,\" s aid Martin. \"We spent months in dispatch centers, with countless experts, learning how the current system works.\" The result is a universal pipeline for data into any 3-digit emergency number globally. RapidSOS will allow connected device manufacturers to provide instant access to emergency services, help insurance companies dramatically improve response times (reducing claims and supporting members), provide in-app safety & security for the shared economy, allow the Fortune 500 to provide universal safety for their employees, allow the home security market to extend their reach out of the home, and help universities address the increasing challenges of sexual assault and gun violence; in the consumer market RapidSOS offers a blanket of safety & security for the entire family. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:47:30.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
