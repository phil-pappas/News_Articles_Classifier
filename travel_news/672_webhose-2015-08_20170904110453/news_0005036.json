As per HolidayIQ's findings, the number of trips planned this monsoon have increased by 47% in comparison to last year. While trips panned over a time period have noticed a dip ranging from a span of 3.4 days to 2.6 days, budgets on the other hand have increased by 31% from INR 14,200 to INR 18,602. \nCommenting on the 'Monsoon Holiday Meter' and the evolving trend, Hari Nair, CEO and Founder of HolidayIQ stated, \" Holidays have evolved from being an annual activity to multiple breaks throughout the year leading to travel picking up during the monsoons too. As destinations are usually less crowded during this season, hotels are waking up to this reality and providing tailor-made experiential monsoon activities and offer massive off-season discounts to sweeten the deal for travelers.\" \n\"Most importantly, travellers are sharing their experiences of these destinations during the monsoon through mobile apps inspiring more people to travel. Number of travellers reading a review before planning a holiday has gone up by 200% in the last 12 months. Recent and relevant reviews from other travellers like themselves also addresses concerns around accessibility, safety, comfort and convenience making for smarter holiday planning,\" he added. \nThe previous year saw group travellers planning holidays during monsoons accounting for 53% of all holidays planned. However, the trend has changed with couples accounting for 45% of all trips planned, followed by group travellers at 33%, family at 19% and 3% of single travellers. \nTop popular destinations include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:42:23.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
