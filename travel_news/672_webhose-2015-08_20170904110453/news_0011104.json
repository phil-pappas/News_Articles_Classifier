Hubs in each region focus on issues and needs most critical to local populations. \n\"Under SERVIR-Mekong, we are tapping into the best available science and technology to help protect this region's vital ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society,\" said Beth Paige, director of USAID's Regional Development Mission for Asia. \"Already, Asian scientists, NASA scientists and others are beginning to develop tools to build resilience and contribute to tackling some of the region's most pressing challenges.\" \nPartnering with NASA and USAID, as part of the SERVIR-Mekong consortium, are the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center; Deltares, headquartered in Delft, The Netherlands; the Stockholm Environment Institute in Sweden; and, the Spatial Informatics Group of Pleasanton, California. SERVIR global demand support is provided by Development Alternatives Incorporated, headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland. \nSERVIR was developed in coordination with the Group on Earth Observations, an alliance of more than 90 nations and organizations collaborating to build a global Earth-observing system to benefit society's needs. Named for a Spanish term meaning \"to serve,\" the program was initiated in 2005 by researchers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, which continues to house the SERVIR Coordination Office. NASA, USAID and their partners operate SERVIR hubs in Kathmandu, Nepal, serving the Hindu-Kush-Himalaya region, and in Nairobi, Kenya, serving Eastern and Southern Africa. The first SERVIR hub, launched in 2005 in Panama City, Panama, served the Mesoamerican region and the Dominican Republic. \nSERVIR is operated by the Earth Science Division's Applied Sciences Program in NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. Marshall collaborates with four other NASA field centers on SERVIR: Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California; Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California; and, Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:35:10.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
