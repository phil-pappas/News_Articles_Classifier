The first program of its kind in the Canadian aviation industry, Canadian Airports Safety Week is an airport-led initiative championed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority and developed in collaboration with 24 participating airports to reach thousands of airport employees through themed displays, discussions and events.\n“Safety has always been a top priority for Canada’s airports. This week, our airport authorities are making sure their employees are up-to-speed on the many risks and challenges they face working in the airport environment,” said Daniel-Robert Gooch, president of the Canadian Airports Council (CAC). “This teamwork among our airports to reinforce safe workplace practices demonstrates our industry’s commitment to the safety of all passengers and employees. It’s a very worthwhile initiative and one that we would like to see expanded to even more airports next year.”\nOn each day of Canadian Airports Safety Week, which will run from August 24 through August 30, participating airport authorities will be emphasizing various safety themes ranging from hazard reporting, worker safety, security, airside vehicle operations, foreign object debris (FOD), construction safety and security, and environmental concerns. Participating airports will also be hosting a variety of activities throughout the week to promote awareness of these issues. Members of the media interested in covering Canadian Airports Safety Week are encouraged to visit the CAC website at www.cacairports.ca for more information on these participating airports.\nSource: CAC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:02:55.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
