Then we found Zendure.”\n“It’s a great product, allowing us to get maximum utilization from our EFBs,” said Titan Airways A320 First Officer Oliver Pickstock. “It’s stylish and provides loads of power.”One hundred Zendure A5 external batteries are now being used on a daily basis on all Titan Airways flights, providing power on the fly for the iPads in the EFBs.\nThe Zendure A5 has much more going for it than just UN38.8 certification. Launched on Kickstarter in 2013, the Zendure A-Series stood out for its extreme durability and crush-proof exterior. In the company’s Kickstarter video, Zendure Co-Founder and CEO Bryan Liu drives a sedan over the Zendure battery a few times while charging an iPhone. The project was one of the most successful battery projects on Kickstarter.\n“It is truly an honor for us,” said Bryan Liu. “Titan Airways is one of the top charter airlines, and Zendure is a top external battery brand. It’s a perfect match. We are excited to be the exclusive external battery supplier for Titan Airways, and we are proud to be able to contribute to the flight industry.”\nSource:-Titan Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:08:43.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
