In addition, a presentation was given for the students. In the course of the presentation, the significance of economic independence, and the steps to create one’s own business were explained. The availability of practical and financial support provided by the Al Raffad Fund was also outlined.\nParticipants expressed their gratitude for Oman Air’s efforts in creating opportunities for students with additional support needs.\nThe event represented a continuation of Oman Air’s educational and community engagement in Oman. It was the latest in a series of educational activities and corporate social responsibility initiatives undertaken by Oman Air with the aim of promoting self-development, social entrepreneurship, and the creation of sustainable development solutions.\nPaul Gregorowitsch, Chief Executive Officer of Oman Air, said:\n“As the national airline of the Sultanate of Oman, Oman Air enjoys a proud history of supporting a range of community-based and educational initiatives. We are therefore very pleased to be continuing this work by joining with the Public Authority for Small and Medium enterprises and the Al Raffad Fund to run this important workshop.\n“The continued economic and industrial success of Oman depends on its young people. Identifying their abilities, supporting their education and training, and empowering them to achieve their full potential is a priority.\n“This workshop has aimed to raise awareness of the importance of meeting the needs of all our students. It has also provided practical guidance and advice about independent living and where further support can be accessed. And it has highlighted the vital importance of Oman’s SME sector in providing the economic and social opportunities which will enable today’s students to develop thriving careers. We look forward to seeing all today’ students, including those with special needs, become tomorrow’s employment success stories.”\nDr. Khalid bin Abdul Wahab Al Balushi, Senior Manager, Government Relations and Sustainable Development at Oman Air, organized the workshop. He added:\n“Oman Air takes every available opportunity to develop the capabilities of young Omanis through training programs. Wherever possible, this is achieved in collaboration with partners such as Government departments, charitable organisations and the private sector. Through these efforts and initiatives, Oman Air is proud to contribute to the enrichment and well-being of all Oman’s students, especially those with special needs.”\nSource:- Oman Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:44:30.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
