Europeans have abandoned this North African country, leaving just local Tunisian beach-goers and visiting Algerians. But they will be gone by month's end, and then the real pain for the country's all-important tourism industry will begin. Attracted by deep price cuts, Tunisians have flocked to the beaches for their summer vacations, but reservation books are empty for the fall as the school year starts. \"We are full for the next three weeks and then we will be empty,\" said Abdelhamid Zaraga, owner of the Atrium Hotel in Hammamet, as he sat in the cavernous hotel lobby bustling with Tunisians in beach gear. \"We've been full since three days ago because we dropped our pants to be cheaper than our neighbors.\"While tourism officially only makes up 7 percent of Tunisia's economy, industry experts estimate its real contribution is closer to 19 percent. And the decision by Britain and some other European countries to warn away their travelers has devastated the sector. The travel guidance was prompted by security concerns after the June attack and another deadly attack in March on the country's leading museum, both by Islamic extremists. Zouhair Mbarek, owner of Batouta Voyages travel agency in Tunis, said no amount of price cutting or other promotions was having any impact in attracting budget-conscious foreigners back to Tunisia — at least in the foreseeable future. \"In the current situation, the issue is not price,\" he said. \"The issue is whether people feel safe enough to come to Tunisia.\"Tunisia depends on tourism to earn hard currency and its revenue covers 60 percent of its commercial debt payments, according to Radhouane Bensalah, the president of the hotel association and the owner of the Saphir Palace in Hammamet. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T13:22:54.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
