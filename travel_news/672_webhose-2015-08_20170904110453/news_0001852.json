(Elaine Thompson/AP)\n... which did not go over well with daddy Future, seen here at MTV Studios in New York in 2012. (Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images) If you strip away the layers of celebrity, this week’s saucy social media dust-up around Ciara and her 14-month-old son with Future is actually a starkly feminist moment.\nIt’s a moment that needs interrogation.\nBut first, translation. There are a lot of twists and turns, so try to keep up.\nCiara, a Grammy-nominated crunk/R&B artist since her breakout 2004 album “ Goodies ,” and rapper Future, whose album “ DS2 ” debuted last month at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, broke off their engagement last August, over his alleged infidelity. In April, Ciara and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson enchanted onlookers with their beautiful-people appearance at a White House state dinner. The two claim to have a mutual vow of celibacy.\n[ Russell Wilson and Ciara dazzle at the White House ]\nLast week, Ciara brought her son, little Future, to the Seahawks’ training camp, where he adorably hugged Wilson. A picture went up online.\nAw, hell naw ! ensued.\nFuture then posted an Instagram photo in which he’s holding up a middle finger. The next day, he tweeted: “Don’t direct my tweets to kno punk a-- hoe. . . . The devil gone come Frm all angles but I’m cover wit Angels . . . ” While I don’t know exactly what that means, Future seemed displeased.\nCommenters, more than 2,500 of them, started taking sides. It boils down to: Was Ciara entitled to take Future’s child to hang out with her boyfriend? Sub-question: And take pictures?\nNew York radio personality Ebro Darden posted a photo of Wilson, the baby and Ciara, saying: “I wonder if Russell has had a convo with Future? He should & Ciara should make sure that happens. This is not OK to me . . . ”\n“I’d go da [expletive] OFF bro!!! [Expletive] outta line to me. . . . But that’s just me,” rapper T.I. tweeted into the fray.\nOne tweeter was downright offended: I hate when people say Future did Ciara wrong — he might have done some little childish stuff, but this woman is about to marry another man. (Mind you, I paraphrased. That tweet actually used much more descriptive language.)\nAnother one: “If I was Future, I would take my kid around a bunch of naked strippers, send a pic to Ciara and say, ‘I’m just as petty as u.’ ”\nCiara has her own staunch defenders.\n“Grow up!” wrote one. “It’s okay for you to cheat on your women, who has your child! But the minute she takes yall son to a man who can and possibly will be a better role model for him than you could ever be you slam Ciara for it!!”\nIn a Storify conversation , blogger and cultural commentator Luvvie Ajayi calls out the crowd that insists that Future should be given deference because he has a No. 1 record. “What does that have to do with the price of rice in Thailand?” she said. She also said: “I’m not even a Ciara as a musician fan. But I am a Ciara as a woman fan. Folks been coming for her for weeks. Let her live.”\n“Wow, this is absolutely about control,” Deesha Philyaw, author of “ Co-Parenting 101: Helping Your Kids Thrive in Two Households After Divorce ,” said she thought when she saw the social media war. “It’s the narrative that says if the mother dates after a breakup, she’s somehow a bad mother. A dad can date,” she contends. “It’s assuming that she did this to insult him, instead of living her life.”\nThis point of view doesn’t acknowledge that Ciara doesn’t owe him fidelity or, assuming the child is not being harmed, even an explanation as to what she does and who she does it with. There’s an assumption of disrespect on Ciara’s part that ignores the actual, explicit disrespect being directed at her.\nI wonder what this angry dust-up would look like if it was about a white pop princess and her Super Bowl beau? When I look through social media for a mainstream feminist response, it isn’t there. But for feminism to be relevant, it needs to be. Because this is youth culture, and it’s ubiquitous and powerful. And because it’s a trickier business to try to change attitudes when folks are 34 instead of 18.\n“With men, it’s that sense of propriety that’s scary,” Philyaw says. “That sense of ownership.”\nMeanwhile, Russell Wilson is tweeting his daily Bible verses. While that might be helpful, I’m hoping this moment gets a broader analysis and response, even some roar, from a wider sisterhood.\nFor more by O’Neal, visit wapo.st/lonnae .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/50WlkKkoAK/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B011A9S8OE", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002SPPWS", "https://instagram.com/p/50fqLjrU-Y/", "http://wapo.st/lonnae", "https://twitter.com/@lonnaeoneal", "https://storify.com/Luvvie/about-ciara-future-and-the-hoe-label", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1608824632"], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:30:07.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
