Soldiers from the Cambodia army have been guarding the Preah Vihear temple, surrounded in jungle and bearing similarities to Angkor Wat , for the last few years. The few tourists that made it to the far north of Cambodia to visit the site were required to check in at an army base on arrival. The temple, declared a World Heritage site in 2008, lies just 100 metres from the border with Thailand, a border that was created at the end of the Second World War. Shortly after, Thai soldiers descended on the temple and a battle ensued with Cambodian troops, with the temple becoming a flashpoint for hostilities in the years that followed.

He visited just before the dispute with Thailand worsened and the Foreign Office advice changed to prevent British tourists from visiting.
