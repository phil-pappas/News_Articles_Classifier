REUTERS \nA topless model who poses for tips in Times Square in New York. \nTimes Square, with its Broadway theatres, huge video billboards, hawkers and tourists, has cleaned up its image in the past 20 years and turned itself into a hub for media and banking. \nThat is a far cry from the 1970s when the city was practically broke and Times Square was synonymous with crime, peep shows, prostitution and drugs. \nWhile the arrival of topless women painted red, white and blue seeking tips is relatively new, costumed characters such as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Iron Man, Thor and Betty Boop have sidled up to tourists in Times Square for years for pictures and a quick buck. REUTERS \nThe Naked Cowboy Robert Burck is happy for the girls to be \n\"You know, de Blasio is not a king. He has the same rights as me. We're all artists and street performers. We self-regulate to protect our tomorrows,\" said one performer dressed as Thor, who refused to give his real name. \nA Reuters witness could not find any painted topless women walking the area on Thursday following a media storm over reports they were behaving aggressively, but one veteran guitar-strumming crooner was not upset. \n\"I'm putting 500 or 600 bucks in my guitar a day. The girls not being here, we clean up,\" said Robert Burck, a former stripper from Cincinnati known globally as The Naked Cowboy. \nBurck says he lets tourists approach him. He has been in Times Square dressed in nothing but his underwear, cowboy hat, boots and guitar since 1998. In over 800 deals, he has licensed his image and endorsed products ranging from Google's Android operating system to Fruit of the Loom underwear, according to his agent, Todd Rubenstein. \n\"I would say he's a millionaire a few times over,\" Rubenstein said. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T20:03:30.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
