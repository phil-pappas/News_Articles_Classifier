Lai Yuen Amusement Park which closed its doors in 1997, makes a comeback as a pop-up carnival event in Central, Hong Kong. Originally located in Lai Chi Kok, it was the first ever-large-scale and iconic theme park built in 1949 where a variety of rides and a private zoo could be found. As Lai Yuen Amusement Park is part of the collective memories of many Hong Kongers, the comeback after 18 years provides tourists an opportunity to embrace the genuine childhood happiness and the very Hong Kong culture. The pop-up fair features a selection of 10 vintage favourites including Lai Yuen Castle, Gum Tiles, Merry-Go-Round and more. The Super TINO elephant, the symbol of Lai Yuen Amusement Park, and other wild animals are recreated by using state-of-the-art technology and large balloons made of environmentally-friendly materials so as to transport guests to the land of old times.
