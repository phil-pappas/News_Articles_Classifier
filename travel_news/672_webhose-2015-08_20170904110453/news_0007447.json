Now two more Star Wars-themed planes are joining the fleet of Japan's largest carrier. \nOne of the designs will feature BB-8, a new character to be introduced in the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. BB-8's likeness will grace one of ANA's Boeing 777-300ER widebody planes. The other new design – on a Boeing 767-300 – will feature both BB-8 and R2-D2. \nRead more from USA Today : Star Wars' PlayStation 4 bundles launch in November \nThe out-of-this-world aircraft liveries are part of a five-year promotional deal between ANA and The Walt Disney Company , which now holds the rights for the Star Wars franchise.
