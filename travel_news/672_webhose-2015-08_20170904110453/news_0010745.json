Iran’s tourism industry expects a boom after the international sanctions imposed on the country are lifted.\nMasoud Soltanifar, the head of Cultural Heritage Organization said after President Hassan Rouhani’s cabinet assumed office, western tourists including from EU, U.S., Canada, and Australia, have visited Iran and the number is now up 50-60 percent.\nHe claimed that in the fiscal year ending March 21, Iran hosted five million travellers, 50 percent of which were religious tourists en route to Mashhad and Qom to see the shrines of Shia sacred figures.\nMashhad is the second most populous city in Iran and the capital of Razavi Khorasan Province in the northeast of the country, close to the borders of Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.\nIran – with an ancient history, mix of cultures, different climatic zones, and beautiful nature –is taking measures to boost its tourism sector, which has been neglected after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nSoltanifar noted that in the programme Vision of Iran 2025, the government is mandated to make necessary policy arrangements to attract 20 million foreign tourists in the next decade, which would provide the country with incomes as high as $25-30 billion.\nThe WTTC in its recent report titled “Travel & Tourism: ECONOMIC IMPACT 2015 IRAN” assessed the value of Iran’s tourism industry for 2014 at about $7.8 billion.\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council forecasts an increase of 6.6 percent in Iran’s tourism industry in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:07:19.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
