This is the third consecutive year that both venues have retained the 4-star rating. \nVisit England's ‘Quality in Tourism assessment' is used to provide consumers with guidance on the quality of accommodation across the UK, including facilities and services to make potential guests aware of what they can expect before they make a booking. The assessment looked at all aspects of the visitor experience, from rooms and facilities to customer service and food, and also focused on the recent changes made to our venues as part of a major refurbishment programme launched last year. Sundial Group's Managing Director, Tim Chudley, said: “We're incredibly proud to have retained our 4-stars by Visit England under their Quality in Tourism scheme. The accolade reflects our commitment to providing an excellent guest experience and is also testament to the hard work of our teams at Highgate House and Barnett Hill.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:54:38.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
