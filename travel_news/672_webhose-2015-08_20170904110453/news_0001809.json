You get a wave every 60 seconds, it’s just a brilliant way to practice your surfing, your manoeuvres. You are guaranteed the same wave every time, so it’s just a brilliant environment to learn how to surf.” \nSurfing isn’t the only innovative adventure sport helping turn Snowdonia into one of the UK’s premiere adventure playgrounds. \nThe national park also has the longest, fastest and biggest zip centres in Europe. \nThe activities are helping regenerate an area hit hard by the decline in mining and industry while also making use of the landscape -- \nThis surreal subterranean play park was built in an old slate mine. \nAt 150 metres, this lagoon in a small village in North Wales has the longest man-made breakers on the planet. — Video screengrab Wil Gritten, team leader, Zip World Titan says, “For young people we’re providing an excellent place for them to work. We’re providing them with some excellent training. It’s really attractive for young people to stay around here and work. Whereas when I was here it wasn’t really attractive.” \nOutdoor tourism, including more traditional ventures like hiking, climbing, and mountain biking, are worth £481 million a year to the Welsh economy, and provide more than 8,000 full time jobs. \nThe government is trumpeting 2016 as the Welsh ‘Year of Adventure’ and says outdoor sports have a knock-on positive effect. \nMandy Williams-Davies, local councillor agrees. \n“It’s creating a destination. It means people are here not for a day on a day trip, they’re here for a week or a fortnight and there’s enough to do, so that in itself offers opportunities for hotels, restaurants and opportunities for employment that come with that.” \nSurf Snowdonia could be a model for that type of tourism, with families and beginners coming to practice on the smaller waves. \nBut the lagoon could also help surfing in its bid for a place at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 by providing a consistent — if not exactly level — playing field. — AFP/Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:50:39.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
