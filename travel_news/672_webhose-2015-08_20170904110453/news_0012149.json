She was unable to board the plane after she started shouting and then fell to the floor inside the terminal. \nA police officer told the South China Morning Post : “She was so drunk… she couldn’t even stand up herself. We took her to a room in a wheelchair so she could rest.” \nShe drank the bottle at about midday, but didn’t sober up until 7pm, when her family came and collected her from the airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:09:49.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
