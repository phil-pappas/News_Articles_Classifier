PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Aug 16, 2015 NC The Baha'i World Centre (right) and Jan at the Wailing Wall Israel \nA determined Orthodox Jew stood before the Wailing Wall aiming his precious note high into a tiny crevice – it looked an impossible task but this was a man with a mission. \nAfter several attempts the missive landed in the spot bringing a smile to his face – and mine. While I’ll never know what he was asking God, I could see how much it meant to make a pilgrimage to the most sacred site in Judaism. \nJerusalem’s Wailing Wall is festooned with notes stuffed into nooks and crannies. It looks like there couldn’t be room for any more but somehow, like the man I watched, people find new places. For me, it was enough to touch the wall for good luck. \nPhysically, it is just a stone wall yet it manages to have an aura that transcends the ordinary. It became a place of pilgrimage after the Romans destroyed the sacred Second Temple in 70 AD and Jewish people have been mourning their ancient loss ever since – hence the name Wailing Wall. \nVisitors must be modestly dressed and men and women are separated into different areas in this open-air synagogue. I perched on a chair in the women’s section to peek at the men bowing their heads in prayer in the men’s section. \nJerusalem is packed with such spiritual sites including the Via Dolorosa, which is believed to be the route Jesus took as he carried his cross to Calvary. \nAt the end of the route lies the Church of the Holy Sepulchre – the shrine of Christianity. What it lacks in grandeur from the outside, it makes up for in being widely acknowledged to be the true spot where the crucifixion, burial and resurrection took place. While the church looks low key, the nearby glittering Dome of the Rock is spectacular to behold. It was built as a bright beacon of Islam, a mosque with ornate mosaics and a crowning dome in gold. It was a thing of beauty but, for me, it was the simplicity of the Wall that shone the brightest. \nFrom traditional Jerusalem I travelled to Haifa where there’s an attractive mix of beaches and boulevards. It is also home of the Bahá’í World Centre, a religious sect that has a magnificent complex on the slopes of Mount Carmel with a gold-domed shrine at its centre. Even more exquisite were the beautiful hanging gardens that tumble down in a verdant, floral cascade – a feast for the senses. \nWhile Haifa was buzzing with life, Tel Aviv – known as the city that never sleeps – puts it in the shade. It has sandy beaches, a waterfront promenade lined with palm trees and a dynamic, 24-hour nightlife. Here you see fashionistas, beach babes and girl soldiers armed with pink phones and rifles slung over their shoulders (conscription into the Israel Defense Forces is mandatory for boys and girls alike over 18). \nShopping is obligatory in Tel Aviv with bustling markets to sample – spices at Levinsky Market, jewellery and crafts at Carmel Market and a treasure trove of antiques at the flea market in Jaffa. \nHaving exercised my flexible friend, it was time to take in Tel Aviv’s White City, a UNESCO World Heritage site with the largest concentration of Bauhaus buildings in the world. I strolled down Rothschild Boulevard to discover the finest examples of the architecture with its clean, geometric shapes. \nI expected to discover a wealth of biblical sights in Israel but also found a country rich in contemporary culture and natural beauty. One week is not enough. \nFor information on Israel, visit thinkisrael.com . NC Paradise found at the Sun Siyam Iru Fushi and (right) Jaymi sips a cocktail Maldives \nSwimming in my private pool at midnight and gazing at the blanket of stars, I had to wonder how on earth I had found myself in paradise. \nIt was my last night at the Sun Siyam Iru Fushi in the Maldives and I was relaxing after a long weekend of, well, relaxing. \nThe trip began with an afternoon at the Spa by Thalgo. A massage was much needed after our 14-hour journey. I was led into a hut scented by jasmine and quite a few degrees cooler than the intense humidity outside. The Swedish massage soothed my travel-weary muscles and I enjoyed a manicure that left my hands smelling divine. \nAs I chilled out with a smoothie in the relaxation area, watching a lizard climb a palm tree, I knew it had set me up for the rest of my holiday. \nSnorkelling the next morning was somewhat more active. I travelled to some of the world’s most unpolluted coral reefs on a traditional Maldivian dhoni boat, a wooden vessel that swung from side to side in the Indian Ocean waves. \nThe water is an unimaginable shade of blue – the kind of turquoise you would assume was Photoshopped in the brochure – and a temptingly balmy 25°C. Despite this, I had never been snorkelling and to be truthful was absolutely terrified to even let go of the ladder. But with some gentle persuasion and a helping hand from two lovely instructors, I soon saw the beauty below. Pink, yellow and green reefs stretched out for miles creating layers that resembled a naturally formed cityscape. Fish, big and small, swam through the crevices and an octopus poked its head out to see what was happening. The scene was so mesmerising I just didn’t want to leave. \nI was warned never to touch the centuries-old coral but one of my instructors dived down to pick up some red, polished remnants from the ocean floor. He gave me a piece as a truly unique souvenir and told me to make it into jewellery. \nBack on dry land the next day I got a taste of Maldivian culture by taking part in a cookery class. I am no Nigella Lawson but the colours and smells made me keen to learn. After making samosas and a fragrant Maldivian chicken curry (and eating the results), I vowed to practise at home. \nOf course, I didn’t have to cook all my food during my stay. With French, Italian, traditional Maldivian and Indian cuisine on offer, there is something for all tastes. The highlight of the trip was the Wagyu strip steak in Islander’s Grill. I savoured every bite. The beef, sourced from Australia, was succulent and tasty. I can say without hyperbole that it was the best steak I’ve ever had. \nFor fitness enthusiasts, the hotel also has a gym, a tennis court, an outdoor yoga studio and a diving centre. It has a family-friendly pool area, complete with waterfall, and another peaceful infinity pool next to a bar selling killer cocktails. \nThat last night summed up the beauty of the Maldives. Nothing can match how luxurious it felt to walk from my private pool and into an outdoor bathroom to wash with nature all around. Listening to the crickets, I felt entirely at peace. \nSouthall Travel ( southalltravel.co.uk ) offers seven nights at The Sun Siyam Iru Fushi ( thesunsiyam.com ) from £1,195 per person in September, including return flights with Turkish Airlines, transfers and breakfast. NC Cool cabanas at the Thompson Miami Beach hotel and (right) Laura in the Wynwood Arts District Miami \nMiami comes with many preconceptions. Sunny retirement destination? Beaches filled with wild students on spring break? Glamorous crime capital serialised by the likes of Miami Vice and CSI ? Not at all – the Miami I saw was a cool, cultured city with more variety than you might think. \nWe stayed at the Thompson Miami Beach hotel in Mid-Beach, the city’s hippest hotspot. It’s a classier, calmer area than its South Beach neighbour, but certainly no less fun. It’s where the crowds that partied hard on Ocean Drive 10 years ago now come to eat, drink and socialise. \nThe Thompson’s décor harks back to Miami’s golden age of the 1950s, with original Art Deco features alongside retro prints and sunny colours. Its restaurant, Seagrape, serves fresh Floridian cuisine from breakfast through to dinner. Start the day with a cold-pressed juice, a big portion of eggs and its famously indulgent sticky bun. The evening’s menu features lots of fresh seafood with a Caribbean twist – think ceviche, lobster and crisp salads. \nFor pre-dinner aperitifs and canapés, head to the 1930s House, a Spanish-style hacienda, and watch the sunset from across the pool. If you fancy a nightcap, the Crown Room is a speakeasy-style bar serving rare spirits, wines and cocktails. If you fancy venturing out, there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. For a real treat, try The Forge restaurant, a glamorous spot filled with Miami’s rich and famous, and $7 million’s worth of wine in its cellars. \nWhen it’s time to relax back at the hotel, lounge in a cabana by the two swimming pools lined with palm trees, amble a few steps on to the beach (there’s direct access from the pool area) or head up to the hotel’s roof for a treatment in its open-air spa. \nYou may be surprised to know that Miami has a huge modern art scene. If you’re not in town for the annual Art Basel show in December, be sure to pay a visit to the Pérez Art Museum Miami ( pamm.org ). Situated on the bay, it’s a modern concrete, wood and glass structure inspired by elevated houses on stilts and contains weird and wonderful pieces of art that are changed every six months. \nIt’s also worth taking a walk around the Wynwood Arts District, a trendy area with exterior walls covered in eye-catching murals, and a favourite for photo shoots and music videos. It’s street art at its finest. \nShopaholics should head to the Lincoln Road Mall in South Beach for a selection of boutiques, restaurants and excellent people-watching spots. For something slightly more active, the Oleta River State Park on Biscayne Bay offers plenty of off-road cycling trails to explore. \nThere seem to be two options with the Miami dress code: skimpy, sexy dresses and skyscraper heels or Lycra yoga clothing, seen on fitness enthusiasts jogging along the boardwalk with a juice in hand. Either way, there’s plenty of flesh on show, which probably has something to do with the year-round tropical climate. June to August is the rainy season, but showers come hard and fast then move on, and they can be a welcome respite from the humid temperatures that reach into the 30s. \nMiami will always be popular with those looking for fun in the sun, but as I found out, this stylish city has so much more to offer. \nRooms at Thompson Miami Beach start at £178 per night from May-September and £255 from September-May.
