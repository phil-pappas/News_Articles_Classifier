Priceline, the world's second largest online travel services company by bookings after Expedia, said net income fell 10.3 percent to USD$517 million from a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it earned USD$653 million in the quarter.\nBookings through the company, which operates Priceline, Booking.com, OpenTable, Kayak and other web sites, rose almost 10 percent to USD$14.96 billion in the quarter. Hotel room and rental car bookings experienced \"accelerating growth\" for the second quarter in a row, it said.\n\"We believe we are well set up to deliver the largest quarter in our company's history,\" chief executive Darren Huston said of the third quarter.\n\"Priceline.com continues to be a tale of two cities, with strong retail performance offset by a shrinking but still large name-your-own-price business,\" Huston said on an investor call, noting that its feature allowing customers to suggest a price they would pay has hurt its business.\n\"OpenTable continued to produce double-digit domestic diner growth,\" he said of the service, acquired by Priceline last year that allows customers to make restaurant reservations online. \"Itâ€™s on track to begin launching new international markets later this year.\"\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:36:33.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
