But chefs are generally prepared to whip up vegan recipes – often really, really good vegan recipes. Buffets feature spreads of fresh salads including creative concoctions involving legumes, there’s fresh fruit galore and rice and stir-fry have practically become a cruise ship staple. You may even find dairy-free ice cream. \nAs with any dietary requests, it’s best to alert the cruise line in advance of your specific needs – or have your travel agent make the call. You’ll also want to make contact with the restaurant staff when you get onboard to make sure they got the message. Vegan theme cruises, meanwhile, guarantee you will have plenty of choices, with kitchens switching to a vegan focus. \nHere are the best cruise lines for vegans. \nRegent Seven Seas Cruises, Oceania Cruises: These sister lines offer an entire Vegan Menu with breakfast, lunch and dinner selections. It works in a seven-day cycle for breakfast and a 14-day cycle for lunch (with four courses available) and dinner (with five courses). You might, for example, start the day with vegan “eggs” benedict, chow down at lunch on an Indonesian vegetable stew and indulge in a dinner of vegan protein with turmeric and vegetable curry, followed by vegan strawberry shortcake. The lines also have vegan cookies, ice cream and tea time selections. \nSeaDream Yacht Club: Try the Blood Apple Blaster (apple, ginger, red beet, lime juice and agave) and the Asian Cashew Curry Salad, and don’t miss the Cashew Lemon “Cheesecake.” This small ship line offers the only “raw food” or “living food” menu at sea. Created in conjunction with the Hippocrates Health Institute, the dishes are prepared with raw, organic and vegan ingredients, none of which are heated above 118 degrees Fahrenheit. \nHolland America Line: HAL’s vegetarian menu specifically designates vegan selections, with several choices for each course. For instance, you might do a vegetable Meze Plate with baba ghanoush, chickpea hummus, stuffed grape leaves and tabbouleh salad, served with warm pita; roasted butternut squash soup; and an entrée of Pad Thai noodles. \nDisney Cruise Line: Disney prides itself on meeting special dietary requests. Vegan meals are available at full-service, sit-down restaurants on all the Disney Cruise Line ships – including the adults-only specialty restaurants Palo and Remy. In addition to letting the cruise line know you want vegan cuisine in advance of your cruise, Disney suggests you alert the head server prior to ordering each meal onboard. \nSilversea Cruises: The luxury line goes with a personalized approach to addressing specific vegan requirements – whether religious, holistic, Ayurvedic or Raw. Guests are asked to advise the line of their vegan dietary needs several months in advance. Once onboard, you meet with the executive chef, who will custom-create a menu for your voyage. \nPrincess Cruises: Vegetarian items are designated with a “V” on dining room menus and at the buffet. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are vegan, but the line says some items can be modified to vegan on request. Tofu, egg-free pasta and vegetarian burgers are available onboard and can be prepared in a variety of styles. \nHolistic Holiday at Sea: This annual cruise, hosted by natural foods expert Sandy Pukel, sets sail on the MSC Divina from Miami, February 27, 2016.
