Nick Gibb said government reforms, which started in 2010, will lead to the end of a system which assessed only “vague thinking” and pandered to “the lowest common denominator”. A series of reforms to introduce “tougher” content for A-level and GCSE subjects will be implemented from this academic year. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing 2015 app for iPhone and Android However, teachers have criticised Mr Gibb for stripping out assessment of soft skills that are highly desirable by employers and for fuelling a “race to the bottom” when it comes to education quality. Writing for Telegraph.co.uk, Mr Gibb said that for years GCSEs and A-levels required “fundamental reform” to make sure their content “reflects the high expectations of employers and universities”. He added: “Over many years, the exam boards had competed with each other to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the battle for market share. “They had pandered to some in the educational establishment who believed that qualifications should assess vague thinking skills rather than core subject knowledge. “To extend opportunity and support more young people to succeed, we therefore launched a programme to reform every GCSE and A-level subject, bringing standards up to match the best around the world. From September this year, the first of these new qualifications will begin to be taught.” Concerns have been raised over OCR's marking and the potential delays students could have faced for their results last summer Photo: Alamy The minister has highlighted how from this academic year, pupils studying sciences will be required to master a minimum of 12 practical activities and the new history A-level will make it mandatory for students to “study topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years”. Reacting to Mr Gibb’s comments, Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said: “The Government’s rush for reform threatens to tarnish the status and quality of the A-level system whilst also creating major implementation challenges for teachers and schools. “The Government has failed to provide schools with clarity about new subject specifications in good time.” • 'Vague' school qualifications are set to become a thing of the past telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:48:07.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
