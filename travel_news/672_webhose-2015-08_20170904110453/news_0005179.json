Sign In Here A month after marking his one year anniversary as president and CEO of CheapCaribbean.com, Steve Dumaine has some new innovations that he hopes will land the company in financial paradise. Dumaine, who has spent more than 10 years in the travel and leisure industry at companies including Sabre Corp., Expedia and Hotels.com, said the company recently received board approval for a significant technology investment that will help it roll out its latest features by the end of next year. “We’re re-platforming the entire company,” he said, adding that teams are building all the technology in-house. “That will include an entirely new site experience for our customers that will be designed from a mobile-first perspective.” The updates should help Dumaine and his team with the firm’s lofty expansion goals. But it also challenges him to keep the company’s culture intact as the business scales. The company was founded in 2000 by Jim Hobbs , who recognized a business opportunity after arranging trips to the Caribbean for his friends and family. “He started out of his garage and just grew it over the years eventually into what we have here,” Dumaine said. “We retained a lot of that great legacy. It is extremely entrepreneurial. “We’re very scrappy.” The company has since been acquired by Apple Leisure Group, backed by Bain Capital. The Pennsylvania-based company bought CheapCaribbean.com for an undisclosed price and kept the existing management team in place to continue running the company. What were your goals in taking the top post at CheapCaribbean.com? When I was evaluating the opportunity, one of the things that I really liked is that we’re an extremely focused business. All we do is sell beach vacations to Mexico and the Caribbean, so we’re able to offer a far different experience than you might get from a full-service travel agency that’s focused on thousands of destinations and hundreds of thousands of properties. I also saw a real opportunity to scale this business. We currently do about a bit over half a billion dollars in sales. I can see the opportunity to double this business in the next few years. Why did you decide to relocate the company from Plano to Addison? Our lease was coming up at the end of May. While there were some things that we liked about the office we were in, there were several things that weren’t working for us. One of which was that there was not enough space on one floor. So we had our team split across two floors. That limited the kind of interaction and collaboration that we think is important. Secondly, the design of that office was much more what I would describe as an insurance company design. We had offices along the outside with all the windows and then in the middle no natural light. We were really trying to move somewhere that had great space that could really emphasize the collaboration of our teams. What has your growth looked like? We have recently been driving close to double-digit revenue growth. We think that there’s actually some pretty significant opportunities for us to continue that by becoming more sophisticated in how we manage our digital marketing — as well as building our brand. We’ve seen about a 35 percent increase in brand awareness, which has been aided by testing into some new channels. One example of that: We’ve been testing digital billboards in Dallas since June and that seems to have worked pretty well for us. In addition to that, we’ve also been testing video on some of the online channels like YouTube. What are your current challenges? We’re on the hunt for talent and there are a number of areas where we’re hiring up — areas like user experience analytics and developers. \nWant Dallas Travel news in your inbox?
