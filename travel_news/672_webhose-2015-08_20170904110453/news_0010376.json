But Israeli newspaper Haaretz, citing anonymous sources in the aviation industry, said the real reason was the carrier’s ties to Arab airlines through its Oneworld alliance . “Profitability wasn’t a problem,” said an industry source, who asked not to be identified. “The past year hasn’t been easy for the airline industry in general, but that’s far from saying that the route wasn’t profitable. No one would have operated a money-losing route for so many years.” American made the decision due to the OneWorld global alliance, whose members include Arab carriers like Qatar Airways and Royal Jordanian and the carrier of the Muslim-majority Asian country Malaysia, asserted the source.

In the case of PHL TLV, a number of factors have resulted in poor financial performance.” Bank cuts 280 positions in Center City When the service began in 2009, it was viewed as a sign of Philadelphia becoming more of an international hub for US Airways, which merged into American in 2013. The news comes at a time when Philadelphia officials are working feverishly to get more Israeli companies to pick Philadelphia as their U.S. headquarters location. Mayor Michael Nutter has made two trips to Israel — fall 2013 and last month — and at least five Israeli firms have agreed to open offices here. Nutter called American’s decision shortsighted. \nGet Philadelphia  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T16:48:29.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
