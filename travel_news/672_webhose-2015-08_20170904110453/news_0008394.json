We had the first visual of two murals we have commissioned and got to see the artists working on the third. We also commissioned a fourth piece to be developed by the Mayor of Seaham, Bruce Burn, which we are very excited to display on our station platform from September.”\nSource:- Northern Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:10:27.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
