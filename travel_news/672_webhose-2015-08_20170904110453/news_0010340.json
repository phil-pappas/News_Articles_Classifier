The situation isn't any better across the pond; only 27 per cent of graduates end up in jobs related to their degree. Stephanie Ritter is one such underemployed graduate, and she is selling her diploma for $50,000 (£32,364). • Top university chief: Is Uni really worth the money? She has been frustrated with her lack of job prospects - she graduated with a major in theatre in 2011 and has since worked as an assistant. A picture of her graduating Photo: Ebay While tidying her room, she found her degree certificate, and decided to sell it for $10,000 more than the degree cost, because the price also includes a 'college experience'. • Deliciously Ella: 'I lived off cereal and pick 'n' mix' • University was never meant to be for everybody The graduate told BuzzFeed: “I thought this piece of paper has so much worth to so many people, but for a theater major, it couldn’t mean less,” \"I’m doing the exact same things and probably getting paid the exact same amount as people that dropped out halfway through freshman year, except I’m still $40,000 in debt and they’re, well, not.\" Stephanie Ritter says on the ebay page that you get: \" • A TOUR of Florida State University including everywhere you would have gone/eaten/partied in your four years at FSU. (Possibly includes but not limited to: Suwanee Hall and a possible Ms. Killings sighting, Jimmy Johns, Mr. Roboto, dinner at Cool Beanz, burgers & beers at Monks, drinks at Poor Pauls) • Access to all of my college memories/Facebook albums for 6 months! (access to any memories by phone or text between 10-7 Sunday-Thursday so you can give someone the most authentic specific memories straight from my brain to their ears) • A show (on me) at the FSU School of Theatre (on opening night if time permits!) • I will rent a car and show you the best view of the capitol building (where it looks most like a penis) • A TOUR OF ALL OF MY FAVORITE PUBLIXES INCLUDING SWEET TEA AT EACH LOCATION!!\" If the diploma doesn't sell, and she's still left in tens of thousands of dollars of debt, Ritter said that she would either find a family with a \"wealthy Daddy Warbucks\" to pay it off, or pay the minimum payments for 25 years until the government wipes it clean. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:21:17.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
