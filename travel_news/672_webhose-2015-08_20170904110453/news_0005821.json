The risk of blood clots in pregnant mothers is almost ten times more likely than a non-pregnant woman . These patient safety risks increase for pregnant mothers who are obese. In the United States , more than two-thirds of adults are obese . Because of the increased risk of blood clots in pregnant mothers, the Physician-Patient Alliance for Health & Safety (PPAHS) released a podcast http://youtu.be/Um2BKewEWRg with Lisa Enslow , MSN, RN-BC. Ms. Enslow is the Nurse Educator for the Women's Health and Ambulatory Care Services at Hartford Hospital in Hartford , Connecticut . \" Pregnant women are at a significantly higher risk than the general public for developing a blood clot simply because of the mechanisms that are in place to help them prevent hemorrhaging,\" said Ms. Enslow. \"So, our pregnant patients really need a lot more risk assessment during their hospitalization and even after discharge. If a blood clot is not detected or treated, it may become dislodged and travel up into the lung and that can create even more problems for the mom.\"In the podcast, Ms. Enslow discussed a case of a super morbidly obese pregnant mother. This mother had a BMI (body mass index) of 67. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:18:12.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
