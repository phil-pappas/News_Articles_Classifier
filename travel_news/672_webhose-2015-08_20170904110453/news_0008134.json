London will be the biggest winner over all, with 17 matches earning the city £197,026,000. Furthermore, transportation bosses will be happy with £15,420,000 extra income as spectators descend on the capital. The 11 host cities will generate between £3,524,934.50 and £197,024,316.33 in terms of money spent on inner-city transport, accommodation, food & beverages, according to the number of expected visiting spectators and the number of games being hosted. For the tourism industry as a whole, the cup is expected to generate a whopping £957,429,314.07. The research focused on transport, accommodation and miscellaneous costs and did not take the cost of tickets into account. The methodology behind it involved making an average of tourist expenditure by nationality of visitors (Visit Britain and UNWTO statistics) along with GoEuro’s Price Indexes.
