For every £1 a visiting golfer spends on green fees, a further £5 is spent on extras such as food & drink and entertainment.\nMike Cantlay OBE, Chairman of VisitScotland said:\n“2015 is an incredible year for golf in Scotland as we cement our reputation as the “Home of Golf”. All across the world golf fans are tuning in to watch some of the biggest events in the sport and at the same time enjoying stunning images of areas like Ayrshire and Arran, where our double-header of major women’s events is being played.\n“This exposure is vital if we want to maintain global interest in Scotland’s golf offering and encourage enthusiasts, both men and woman, to make Scotland their number one choice for a golf break.”\nThe RICOH Women’s British Open was first played in Scotland in 2002 at Turnberry and since then has been played at St Andrews, in 2007 and 2013, and at Carnoustie, in 2011. The venue for the 2017 RICOH Women’s British Open has been confirmed as Kingsbarns Golf Links (the first Major Championship to be hosted there). The 2015 event will be the last Major competition played on the Ailsa course at Trump Turnberry before it undergoes a redesign.This is part of a multi-million pound refurbishment project being undertaken by The Trump Organization to upgrade and enhance all aspects of the Resort including the course, clubhouse, hotel and spa.\nJavier Diez-Aguirre, Vice President, Corporate Marketing, Ricoh Europe Plcof Ricoh said:“The RICOH Women’s British Open has grown to become a real highlight of the international golf calendar across both the women’s and men’s game, and we are very proud of how much it has achieved to promote women’s golf both here in the UK and internationally. We look forward to welcoming everyone this week and hope that as many people as possible will come to experience and enjoy watching the world’s finest female professionals test their skills at this unique, stunning championship venue.”\nThe RICOH Women’s British Open, which is supported by VisitScotland, is the latest in a series of nine top-class golf events taking place this year across the country and are expected to attract more than 300,000 spectators.Following the success of what what is regarded as the “best-ever” Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in 2014, the national tourism organisation has continued to support golf tourism – which is worth an estimated £220m to the economy and supports around 4,400 jobs.VisitScotland is investing a total of just over £2 million into eight professional golf events in 2015.\nScotland’s spectacular ‘summer of golf’ teed off in June at the SSE Scottish Hydro Challenge at Spey Valley Golf Club, Aviemore.The programme has included The Scottish Open at Gullane, The Open Championship at St Andrews and most recently The Aberdeen Asset Management Ladies Scottish Open at Dundonald Links.\nSource:- VisitScotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T22:17:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
