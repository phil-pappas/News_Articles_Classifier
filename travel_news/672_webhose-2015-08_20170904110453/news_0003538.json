In London, luxury hotels and tourist destinations have coordinated to best let people discover scones, jams and other delights that make up this special moment. Our selection of five unique places for your tea. \nTea masterclass at Harrod's \nThe famous London luxury store is organising masterclasses on August 13 and 14 dedicated to tea tasting. Within the confines of its iconic Georgian Restaurant, Harrod's will present a selection of ten of its very own tea specialties. The tasting will be accompanied by delicacies like scones served warm with a rose petal gelée. Expect to pay £50 (RM311) per person, and make sure to reserve ahead of time at reservations@harrods.com. \nA fragrant experience at the InterContinental Park Lane \nWhen the world of perfumes meets afternoon tea... To celebrate this event, the hotel has organized a workshop to demonstrate the way in which perfumes and cooking techniques can work together to create an ultra-gourmet afternoon tea. To this end, the head of Floris London and her spokesperson will lead demonstrations on August 13. Expect to shell out £35 per person for the workshop and an afternoon tea complete with a glass of Champagne in the Wellington Lounge. \nJapanese-style afternoon tea \nThe Courthouse Hotel will thumb its nose at British tradition by reimagining British tea with Japanese ingredients. Guests will, for example, taste a plum wine that is traditionally served in the land of the rising sun, or an Asian effervescent wine. The cost: £29.50 per person. \nA gourmet moment with author Rosie Millard \nAfternoon tea at the Conrad Saint James will adopt an educational outlook with the presence of author Rosie Millard. The journalist will discuss her latest book, The Square , while guests enjoy coconut or pineapple scones and mojito macaroons.
