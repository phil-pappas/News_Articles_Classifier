Also have it scanned electronically in case you need to email a copy to a physician or to the emergency room.\n• Credit cards: Remember the days when credit-card companies set up tables on the college green and pushed card offers at students with little or no income? Those days are over, thanks to federal laws that require anyone under 21 applying for a credit card to have an independent source of funds to pay the bills.\nThomas Nitzsche, financial educator for ClearPoint Credit Counseling Solutions in Atlanta, says in most cases college freshmen are using accounts cosigned by parents. He recommends parents sign up for mobile alerts to track expenses coming in from their kids. Have a conversation with your child about budgeting to head off any problems, he says.\nAnd know that if your child goes bananas, your credit will take a hit. One way to manage this is to pay the bills yourself and have your child pay you each month for his or her expenses.\nAnother option is to equip your child with a debit card instead of a credit card. She won’t be building credit history but will understand that when the money is gone, it’s gone. You could also add your child as an authorized user on your account. He will have his own card and begin building credit history, but you are managing the account.\nWith many cards, you can set spending limits for authorized users to avoid out-of-control spending.\nWhen you think your child is ready for an individual account, open a new account in his or her name or convert an existing cosigned account.\n• Cellphones: At age 18, your child may qualify for his or her own cellphone contract. If you prefer to keep your child as an authorized user on your account, know that there may be some restrictions.\nUnder AT&T policy, for example, authorized users cannot open or initiate a new line. If your child loses a phone or the phone is stolen, you should be able to authorize your child to get a replacement device at a retail location, says company spokesman Lance Skelly. Or you can purchase a new device yourself and ship it overnight to your child.\nIt may be cheaper to open a new line, but you would first have to remove your child from your account, he says. And you would then end up paying for two phones and two lines. Finally, if your child has a history with lost or stolen phones, it may be a good idea to get insurance so you can file a claim and replace the device.\nNedra Rhone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:18:12.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
