Visitors and residents can also cool off at the Crystal Lagoon water park, a 100-berth marina and 300 meters of sandy beach.\nMeydan One Mall -- because of course there's a mall -- will be home to 652 stores.\nWalking through its many aisles should offer the site's planned 78,300 residents entertainment and exercise enough, but there's also a 25,000-square-meter indoor sports facility and 8,000-capacity venue.\nThe estimated $8.6 billion scheme is scheduled for completion in time for the UAE's hosting of World EXPO 2020, with construction already underway.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-medium-plus-169.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/zi5PGvNaNt8", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150805140310-meydan-one-dubai-mall-3-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-05T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:57:41.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
