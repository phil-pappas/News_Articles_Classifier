But sometimes he grabs a bulkier one, packed with about $1,200 worth of athletic gear — trail-running sneakers, trekking poles, compression socks, salt tablets, a space blanket and a first aid kit — and heads to the airport.\nMr. Woon grabbed the larger bag one recent Friday and caught a two-hour flight to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. He spent much of the afternoon and evening dozing in a hotel, then, at 1 a.m., climbed into a shuttle bus bound for Gede Pangrango National Park, about 50 miles southeast of Jakarta.\nBy 4:45 a.m., he was stretching with more than 100 fellow runners in a meadow at the edge of a forest, the starting line of the Gede Pangrango Marathon. The grass was slick with dew, and the temperature was cool enough that some runners wore long sleeves; Mr. Woon had a neon-green jacket. Above them loomed the peaks of the Gede and Pangrango volcanoes.\nContinue reading the main story Gede Pangrango National Park Java Sea\nJakarta\nWEST JAVA\nBogor\nMT. PANGRANGO\nMT. GEDE\n20 miles\nMALAYSIA\nSINGAPORE\nINDONESIA\nIndian\nOcean\nArea of detail\n500 miles\nThe 42-kilometer, or 26-mile, race, which would include a net elevation gain and loss of almost 13,125 feet, was Mr. Woon’s fifth trail-running event in three years.\n“It’s very mental, it’s very technical, and physically, you’re tired and hungry,” Mr. Woon, 35, said of long- distance trail running. But he added that the sense of achievement after finishing a trail race was often greater than the one that follows a road marathon.\nMr. Woon said he began running in 2011, at first just doing about 1,300 feet by circling his Singapore apartment complex. After a few traditional marathons, he decided that he preferred trail races because they offered more chances to see nature and take pretty photographs — the sort of nature experiences normally associated with hiking and camping.\nAnd the physical demands let him challenge the limits of his increasing endurance. He even began training for ultra trail races, which are longer than the traditional marathon distance and require almost continuous motion for as long as 30 hours.\nWhen you’re on the trail for such a long time, “you get into a mode of meditation,” he said. “It becomes a religion.”\nMr. Woon’s interest in trail races — and his travel schedule — reflect the growing popularity of trail running in the Asia-Pacific region.\nTrail races have been expanding for more than a decade in Europe and North America, but Asia-Pacific runners and race organizers say interest in the sport has boomed in China, Singapore, Malaysia and elsewhere in the last two to four years. Such events offer a welcome contrast to life in crowded Asian megacities, observers say, and runners love the camaraderie that develops along the trail.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The growth since 2011 has been “amazing,” said Steve Brammar, a race director in Hong Kong: “Six, seven years ago, it was something a few skinny people did, whereas now it’s becoming a mainstream endeavor.”\nOne illustration is the surging interest in Vibram Hong Kong 100, a 100-kilometer ultra trail race that Mr. Brammar and his wife, Janet Ng, founded in 2011. The race initially drew 30 runners from Singapore, two from Malaysia and three from mainland China, he recalled. But this year’s race, in January, drew about 500 runners from mainland China and more than 100 each from Singapore and Malaysia.\nAnother sign is the emergence of the Asia Trail Master Series , a marketing platform for 20 trail races created by Kuai Sports Promotions, a Hong Kong-based company that specializes in outdoor recreation.\nThe series’ first race, Ultra Trail Hong Kong, was in February. Kris Van de Velde, a sports promoter who manages the series and founded Kuai Sports, said his company co-organizes a few of the 20 races and handles promotion for others. It also manages a point-scoring system that ranks runners by their top three finishes and gives them chances to win cash prizes.\nTrail running is becoming popular in Asia partly because people are proud to finish races, Mr. Van de Velde said. “But the big reason is people who have money in Asia just like to get out into nature from time to time.” He added that recreational runners from Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia are best represented in the series and that many runners come from the Philippines, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.\nThe Gede Pangrango Marathon was the first Indonesia trail race included in the Asia Trail Master Series. It is one of several organized by Fonesport, an adventure company founded last year in the Indonesian city of Bogor, about 35 miles from Jakarta. More than 500 of the race’s nearly 600 runners were Indonesian, according to Fonesport, while 49 were travelers or Indonesia-based expatriates from Singapore, Malaysia and 15 other countries.\nThe race began at 5 a.m., well before dawn, as about 100 runners in the full marathon category dashed up a forest trail in a swarm of bobbing headlamps. Runners in both the 21-kilometer and 15-kilometer categories started an hour later, just after the sun had broken over the twin volcanoes’ peaks.\nThe runners crossed a rickety concrete bridge and, as the strong tropical rays began to beat down through the forest canopy, began a long climb up Mount Gede. Dozens of Indonesian hikers along the trail cheered them on and at trail-side checkpoints, volunteers offered water and bananas.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The trail crossed some dangerously slippery rocks beside a hot spring and then snaked through the hikers’ trailside tent encampments. By mid-morning, Mr. Woon and other full- and half-marathoners began to emerge from the forest and scramble toward Mount Gede’s 9,842-foot peak, along a rocky ridge the width of a city sidewalk.\nThe sky was clear, and the scree-strewn summit offered panoramic views of the mountain valley and some steam vents spewing pungent, sulfurous gases. Some runners paused to take photos or simply to let the breeze cool their bodies.\nThe 15-kilometer runners had four and a half hours for their course. Those in the half-marathon category had seven hours, and some finished in time for lunch. Others came in after the deadline but still had plenty of time to kick their sneakers off and watch the sun set over the mountain valley.\nShinta Syam, a 35-year-old Indonesian runner who did a half marathon, lounged on the grass near the finish line. She and a group of friends who had driven from Jakarta all wore matching T-shirts that read “Happy Runners” in Indonesian Bahasa, the national language.\nMs. Syam said that the rocks along the course were more slippery than she had expected and that she was disappointed to finish after the official cutoff time. But she added that she was happy to be exercising far from Jakarta’s polluted air and proud to have lost 55 pounds in her two-year running career.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “Two years ago I was a big fat lady, and running made me slimmer,” she said. “No matter how far we run, and even if we get injured, we’re happy.”\nZedy Wiepandy Ng, 32, a marketing manager from the Indonesian city of Medan who lives in Singapore, said he had run more than 15 marathons and trail races around Southeast Asia, and the Gede Pangrango race was the hardest.\nHe broke his glasses while running through a rocky area and had to cling to a friendly stranger’s arm to finish a half marathon.\n“Would I do that again? No,” said Mr. Ng, who sat under a large, open-air tent near the finish line. “But it was quite fun when you look back — and when you’re sitting here.”\nAt the time, Mr. Woon and the roughly 100 other full marathoners still had a long way to go — and another volcano to climb — within their 16-hour time limit. The winner finished the race around 3 p.m. But most of the others were still pushing through the forest when night fell and a heavy thunderstorm began.\nAt one point during the evening, Mr. Woon recalled, a volunteer at a trailside checkpoint said he would not complete the race by the 9 p.m. deadline. He asked if there were shuttle buses to drive “D.N.F.”, or “did-not-finish,” runners to the finish.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story “Sorry, sir, there’s no bus coming,” Mr. Woon said the volunteer responded. “This is a mountain.”\nAs the rain pelted down, Mr. Woon said, two concerns began to weigh on him. First, he noticed that his battery-operated headlamp was growing faint and he wondered how long it would last. And because he had not eaten a full meal all day, he hoped he had enough energy to finish.\nBut for long stretches of trail, there were no race volunteers in sight, much less medical professionals, Mr. Woon said. His only companions were trees, rocks and raindrops. And his only option was to keep running, or walking, as fast as he could — without falling down.\nAround 10 p.m., he finally emerged from the forest, spattered with mud and with a bright-red cut over one eye. Near the finish line he found a shuttle bus and climbed inside with a few other exhausted runners.\nWhen the bus stopped well after midnight at Mr. Woon’s Jakarta hotel, he shouldered his pack and walked quietly toward a bank of elevators. His first priority was preparing a packet of instant noodles.\nBut within days, he later recalled, he was training for his next challenge: a 100-kilometer ultra trail race in Borneo. The net elevation gain and loss would be 19,685 feet.\n“To run a 42-kilometer road marathon, you have to have a certain mental discipline,” Mr. Woon said by telephone from Singapore. “To run an ultra trail marathon? You need to be really stubborn.”", "external_links": ["http://www.asiatrailmaster.com/"], "published": "2015-08-31T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T09:49:44.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
