You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Ghislain Mary/Flickr \n…Wanaka, New Zealand! This resort town has everything you need for a great daydream. Mountain views, cafes and vineyards, lake activities and restaurants, even a nightlife scene that is diverse enough to please any age group. Our favorite tourist attraction is Stuart Landsborough’s Puzzling World. The Puzzling World is home to the Leaning Tower of Wanaka, The SculptIllusion Gallery, and an incredible maze. Wanaka is also close to Mount Aspiring National Park, which represented Lothlórien and Isengard in Peter Jackson’s \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.
