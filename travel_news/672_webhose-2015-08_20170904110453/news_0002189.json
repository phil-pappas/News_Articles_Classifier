I go there to rest my soul. I also go there for adventure. \nI first visited Patagonia in 2011 to fly-fish with my husband Ed, a busy physician and medical school administrator, and we had a wonderful time. Our base was San Martín de los Andes, a charming resort town in the Neuquén province of Argentina surrounded by deep blue lakes and winding rivers that are home to large healthy rainbow and brown trout. Our fishing guides were superb, the accommodations were comfortable – some even first class – and the logistics were so well executed that except to fish, we barely lifted a finger. I marveled at this and decided that I had to share it with others. \nExcept that it’s not just about the place. The people of Patagonia are beautiful, too, and I have grown to admire them for their resilience and resourcefulness. Hardworking, kind and generous, they make every effort to ensure that visitors feel welcomed. A big hug (un abrazo grande) and a peck on the cheek are standard greetings, and when they say “Goodbye! I hope to see you again soon!” they mean it. So trek on a glacier, catch some trout, watch the whales or ski in the Andes Mountains. Better yet, do all of that and more. Here are a few reasons why you should make Patagonia your next travel stop: \n1) It's surprisingly accessible and affordable. From the U.S., you can be there in less than 24 hours, and a five-star meal with a scrumptious dessert costs no more than a movie. \n2) The Southern Patagonia Ice Field and its massive glaciers are breathtaking . Truly. Pictures don't tell the story; standing with and even touching them does. \n3) The empanadas are as big and fluffy as pillows. \n4) The whales swim so close that you feel their breaching mist on your face. \n5) The penguins ignore you, even when they're standing right there. \n6) The Argentine and Chilean men and women are strong, resourceful, resilient, and super. \n7) It’s so peaceful and quiet you can almost hear the grass grow. Just ask the guanacos. \n8) The trout are among the healthiest and largest in the world. Happily, your fishing guide will know precisely how to catch them. \n9) There are limitless opportunities for trekking and skiing, and the views will take your breath \n10) You see the color blue as you've never seen it before. \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR: Karen Dodson is Reveal Patagonia’s founder and Chief Executive Officer and divides her time between the company’s United States operations in St. Louis, Missouri, and Patagonia.
