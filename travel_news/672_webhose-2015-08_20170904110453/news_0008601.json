Tour members sample local dishes, hear about the region’s history and culture and see highlights of the area’s sights. When they complete the tour, they’ve enjoyed the equivalent of a meal and learned their way around a new city. \nMariela Rexach, a lawyer, and Jose Rodriguez, a cardiologist, visiting from Puerto Rico, started their visit to Miami Beach ’s popular South Beach neighborhood with the SoBe Tour des Forks from Miami Food Tours . \n“When you travel, food is the best way to learn about a place and its culture,” Rexach said. “We always plan our days around the food.” \nThey researched food tours on Trip Advisor because they had experienced and enjoyed them in other cities. \n“I like this because it’s a less touristy tour,” Rexach said. “You feel like you’re seeing the real city, the places where people who live here go.” \nThe Miami Beach food tour (one of several food tours here) starts at Books & Books , an institution on Miami Beach’s Lincoln Road shopping and dining mall. It’s a good example of how a tour can weave a city’s history into its food. \nWhile tour members sampled a platter of appetizers that included hummus, corn salad, guacamole, ceviche and homemade corn chips, tour guide Juanita De Castro described how this popular book store was founded in the 1980s by Mitchell Kaplan, a member of a unique cultural group in Miami -- Cuban Jews, who fled Castro and settled in Miami after the Cuban revolution. \nThen it’s off to the next stop, Abuela’s , a traditional Cuban restaurant with a take-out window where De Castro ordered a colada, a Styrofoam cup with enough Cuban-style espresso to share and serve four to six shots of the powerful brew. This is the way Miami workplaces are fueled, she said. As tour members sipped their coffee and tasted pasteles (Cuban pastries) they learned about the various types of Cuban coffee, from sweetened cortaditos to the milder café con leche. \nThe Miami Food Tour includes only individually owned restaurants, which is typical of Florida food tours. It stopped at a family-owned Peruvian spot and a Brazilian restaurant. At each, heaping platters of food were served family style and the cuisine and restaurant’s story were described. Along the way, visitors learned about Art Deco architecture, the enduring legacy of “Miami Vice” and the Hollywood-worthy story of Miami Beach founder Carl Fisher. \nThe final stop: The Frieze Ice Cream Factory , with choices including some definite only-in-Miami flavors: dulce de leche, tamarind, key lime pie and guanabana sorbet. \nThe Miami tour covers 1.5 miles on foot and tour members pay a single price. There are no transactions after that – no bills, no tips, no hassles – and that’s a standard feature of food tours. \n“You don’t have to decide what to order. In fact, you get to try something you would never order,” said the cardiologist Jose Rodriguez. “You get to taste a little of this, a little of that. A little fish. A little steak. \n“I’ve been to Miami on business several times,” he added. “But I didn’t get any real feel for the city like I did with this.” \nEating your way through Delray Beach \nNinety minutes north of Miami, there’s a food tour of one of three historic Palm Beach County areas every Saturday. These tours are operated by a non-profit organization, the Museum of Lifestyle and History, and its mission is both education and entertainment \nThis tour travels by bus. The Delray Beach / Boynton Beach tour makes eight stops, including a historic church and an urban garden. It’s chock-full of Florida history, with a particular emphasis on pioneer African Americans and Seminole Indians in addition to the white pioneers you often hear about. \nLike the Miami tour, the Delray Beach tour highlights family owned restaurants, starting at Sweet’s Jamaican Café . There, delighted tour member Carol Newman texted her son: “I just had curried goat!” \nThe Jamaician specialties filled big platters from which tour member also tried Jamaican beef patties, oxtail, rice and peas, curried chicken and plantains. \nAs the tour continued, Newman and tour mates sampled their way through herbal teas, paella, sangria, coconut-crusted tofu, meatballs in jerk-seasoned sauce, lemonade from a secret recipe, macarons, grass-fed beef sliders, almond-crusted swai (a fish), finishing up at Sicilian bakery where there is a huge variety of cookies and pastries that few have room for. \nThe quantity and variety, Newman said, “is more than I ever dreamt.” \nIn St. Augustine, it’s also a wine tour \nIn St. Augustine , one popular food tour isn’t by bike or foot; it travels the cobbled streets by horse-drawn carriage. And the tour isn’t only about the food and the history; tour members sample wines, too. \nThe three-hour-long Vittles and Vino VIP Carriage Tour offered by the Tasting Tours includes four to five food tastings, three to four wine samples and bottle of wine to share on the carriage ride, according to co-founder Andrea Jones. The company offers wine-only tours, beer-tasting ours and a food-wine walking tour called Corks and Forks. \nFor restaurants, participating in these tours is a good way to reach new customers, especially visitors from out of town. \n“We’re going off the beaten path,” Jones said. “We take them to places they would never find in a million years.” \nTips for visitors \nVisitors interested in food tours may want to find out whether vegetarians, vegans and those with food allergies are accommodated. (Miami Food Tour went out of its way to make sure one tour member avoided fruits and nuts and that another had vegetarian options. The Delray Beach food tour cannot make special provisions.) \nMost tours involve walking, so check if you need to wear those comfortable shoes. \nMost tours go rain or shine and you must pre-pay to hold your spot. \nAlmost all tours can be booked as private tours for groups. Food tours, in fact, are a growing trend for bachelorette parties. Tour guide DeCastro, added: “They come down for a short period of time and it’s a great way to see the city in an afternoon. And then they’re free to party at night.” \nHere’s a list of several established food tours. Check the individual websites for prices, dates and other details: \nMiami Food Tours .
