In his cramped office at the city’s morgue, Dr Vladimir Nunez explains that with five or six murder victims arriving at his gates every day there is neither the time nor the resources to investigate every death or calculate how many were victims of gang violence. “Ten per cent or less are investigated and the rest are just forgotten for whatever reason,” he says simply. “No one can give exact statistics on how many are killed by gangs.” The Honduran city is at the epicentre of Central America’s gang wars . Drug running, extortion and political corruption have earned the city the unwanted title of murder capital of the world since 2011. The most recent statistic records a rate of 169 homicides per 100,000 people – well above Flint, Michigan, for example, the US murder capital with 62. This grim statistic is partly why Kenco has established Coffee vs Gangs , as a way of getting young people away from the murderous drug trade. The statistics translate into a city where the wealthy live in gated communities and shopping malls buzz with armed guards. Traffic jams are silent – no one beeps their horn for fear of provoking a violent response. And it means the government mortuary is busy with relatives and funeral directors around the clock. Dr Nunez is the forensic examiner charged with trying to investigate as many murders as he can, all from a building he calls “obsolete”. Almost 100 bodies are currently stored in a refrigerated truck in the car park while the surgery rooms and morgue are upgraded. The smell of death from the old building is overpowering. Almost 100 bodies are currently stored in a refrigerated truck in the car park while the surgery rooms and morgue are upgraded “That’s 12 years of secretions that have soaked into the ground,” says Dr Nunez in a matter-of-fact tone during a tour of the facilities. He breaks off to answer his mobile phone. Police believe they have found the burial site of a woman who was kidnapped and then murdered. Officers are planning to exhume the body. Dr Nunez, 40, sounds like a man well used to the grim reality of life and death in the world's murder capital. “There are not enough resources,” he says, returning to his story. “We don’t have the capacity, the logistics to be able to do everything we want to, to find the evidence that we can use in a trial.” He estimates he needs another 50 staff to cope with the workload, which has already surpassed 1,200 murders this year. Dr Nunez has been in charge of the mortuary for the past eight months since being transferred from the capital Tegucigalpa. “The job is something of a hot potato,” he says with a giggle and a large dose of understatement. He says he tries not to think too much about the shattered lives and broken families represented by each body on the slab. “It’s not healthy, mentally or physically” is how he puts it. “The majority of homicides are young people,” he says. “They don’t know what the future is yet. It’s so sad.” Last year, 700 bodies were not even claimed.
