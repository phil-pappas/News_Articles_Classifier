Seven main venues for the festival are the Hub, Usher Hall, the Queen's Hall, Festival Theatre Edinburgh, Royal Lyceum Theatre, King's Theatres and the Edinburgh Playhouse. The festival traditionally ends with a spectacular fireworks concert. Visit www.EIF.co.uk. AWA ODORI August 12 to 15, Tokushima, Japan Tokushima's streets are filled with costumed dancers for four nights of partying and dancing at the traditional Awa Odori, the largest dance festival in Japan. The event is held as part of the Bon celebrations, Japan's festival of the dead that welcomes spirits of deceased ancestors. During the daytime a restrained dance called Nagashi is performed, but at night the dancers switch to a frenzied dance called Zomeki. The song used during the dance means both dancers and watchers are fools so let's dance. Spectators are encouraged to join the dance. GEORGE TOWN FESTIVAL Until August 31, Penang, Malaysia One of Asia's hottest up-and-coming arts events, Penang's George Town Festival (GTF), returns this month with an unbeatable line-up of local and international performances, exhibitions and events. Three of this year's highlights will be making their Asian debut, including the Spanish hip hop/flamenco fusion dance theatre Titanium, the Australian-made, highly choreographed musical and dance feature AM I, and the Iranian experimental theatre Slow Sound of Snow. Berlin's Rimini Protokoll will make their Southeast Asian premiere with one of the festival's most anticipated shows, \"100% Penang\". NAG PANCHAMI (SNAKE DAY) August 19, India Naga Panchami is a Hindu festival celebrated by Hindus in most parts of India. People go to temples and snake pits to worship the snakes. Milk, honey and silver jewellery is offered to the cobras so they will protect the worshippers from all evils. This festival is to celebrate the day lord Krishna defeated the serpent Kalia. PHILADELPHIA FOLK FESTIVAL August 13 to 16, Philadelphia, USA The family-friendly Philadelphia Folk Festival is held annually at Old Pool Farm, just outside the city.

NOTTING HILL CARNIVAL August 30 to 31, London, England Notting Hill Carnival is London's most vibrant celebration of diversity, colour and sound. The event first took place in 1964, when the area's Caribbean community, suffering from discrimination, came together to create a festival with calypso music and steel bands reminiscent of the annual Trinidad carnival. The Notting Hill Carnival has become an internationally acclaimed event which remains true to its Caribbean roots. Over the last five decades, it's matured into a melting pot of diverse cultural and musical genres that come together in modern West London streets. Today it is Europe's largest street festival with hundreds of thousands of regular visitors enjoying live Masquerade bands, Sound systems, street food, dancing and much more. During the event, the area around Notting Hill and Ladbroke Grove is packed so don't even think of driving - take the bus or Tube.
