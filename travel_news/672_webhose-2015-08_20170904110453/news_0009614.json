Frui's photography holidays are exclusively for solo travellers, for beginner standard right up to masterclass trips, and you could hone your talent anywhere from Burma to Cuba.\n3.

GoLearnTo has courses in globally useful languages from French and Spanish to Arabic, Chinese and Japanese.\n4. Write your novel\n© Provided by Huffington Post 2015-08-25-1440527231-1496739-womanwritenoveltravelpixabay.jpg Award-winning writers including Hilary Mantel and Hanif Kureishi have been guest speakers on the creative writing holidays at the Skyros Centre in Greece.

Master patisserie\n© Provided by Huffington Post 2015-08-25-1440527730-2061445-cakecookholidaytravelpixabay.jpg The country that gave us the word 'gourmet' should be your first stop if you're looking to brush up some cordon bleu-worthy baking - and there are cookery courses galore in France. Flavours of France has a string of four-day and week-long breaks across the country, some without single supplements, including ones devoted solely to mastering patisserie.\n6. Change someone else's life\nTaking to the sea in a tall ship will always be a memorable experience, but joining teens and young adults with a wide range of disabilities on the specially designed craft from the Jubilee Sailing Trust is even more so. As well as day-to-day activities like taking watch and helping prepare food, you'll be the able-bodied buddy of one of the other passengers - choose between short trips in the Solent or 55-day cross-ocean voyages.\nCathy Winston is editor of 101 Singles Holidays .\nPhotography image courtesy of Frui, all other images courtesy of Pixabay\n© Tetra Images via Getty Images ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9Mwd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9EZK.img&description=2015-08-25-1440527730-2061445-cakecookholidaytravelpixabay.jpg+-+Provided+by+Huffington+Post", "http://www.101holidays.co.uk/singles", "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9Mwd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9uSP.img&description=2015-08-25-1440527195-4011356-PhotographyholidaysFrui.jpg+-+Provided+by+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9Mwd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9uT8.img&description=Tetra+Images+via+Getty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9Mwd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9MvQ.img&description=2015-08-25-1440527231-1496739-womanwritenoveltravelpixabay.jpg+-+Provided+by+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBm9Mwd%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm9HvD.img&description=2015-08-25-1440527156-8805902-womaninspireworldtravelpixabay.jpg+-+Provided+by+Huffington+Post"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T07:32:33.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
