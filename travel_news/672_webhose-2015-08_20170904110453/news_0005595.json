However, a spokeswoman for Jet2holidays said the company had apologised to the party that included Phythian and immediately spoke to the hotel about the incident. \nShe added: “The hotel management have assured us it was never their intention to cause any offence or upset with their entertainment programme. \n“This was a Hollywood-themed poolside show, which included the characters Rambo and Superman, and it is always well received by the hotel’s residents. \n“The management now understands some of the costumes may have caused offence and will no longer use these in their shows.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:19:36.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
