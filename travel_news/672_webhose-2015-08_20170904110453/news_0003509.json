Just 30 minutes off the southwest coast of the main island, this small bit of land is lined with coral and caves, perfect for exploration by both land and sea. Although Liuqiu does have a tourism industry, it is not very developed, and best of all, you can reach this little paradise via a short ferry ride from the city of Dong Gang for about six bucks. I was amazed when I discovered the island, and visited several times while I lived in the area. It is Taiwan’s best little secret. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nAt about four square miles, Liuqiu is a tiny island. You can drive around the perimeter of it on a scooter (available to rent at the ferry landing for about $6 USD/day) in 30 minutes. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThe island has several scenic temples including this large one on a spit of land above a harbor. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThere are only a couple of beaches on the island (the rest of the coastline is jagged cliffs and caves), but they are beautiful, with gritty beige coral sand, flanked by rugged lava rock and foliage. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nOne of the island’s most popular attractions is Black Dwarf Cave, also known as Black Ghost Cave. Entrance costs NT$50 (about $1.50 USD). It is said that 300 aboriginals were burned alive there by the Dutch when they occupied Taiwan. A walkway leads you down through a maze of lava rock formations. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThere are spectacular views of the Taiwan Strait to the west. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nSome of the passageways are a bit tight. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nTree roots snake across the rock formations — the climate is so humid that the roots can absorb moisture directly from the air. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThere are several viewing platforms where visitors can rest and enjoy majestic sunsets. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nOwing to the coral formations and plentiful sea life, snorkeling on Xiao Liuchiu is excellent. One of the best places to do it is beneath the island’s iconic Vase Rock. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThe downtown area near the harbor consists of a brick main street lined with seafood restaurants, shops, hotels, and scuba and snorkel rental stores. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nOne of the island’s best-known attractions is its fresh seafood, which is famous throughout Taiwan. It’s not strange to see fish still flopping in the glass display cases outside of restaurants. \n(Photo: Matt Gibson/ XpatMatt ) \nThe island is also home to the best-dressed Taiwanese man that exists. He sells drinks out of a cooler to snorkelers while listening to his old radio and smoking cigarettes through a seashell. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
