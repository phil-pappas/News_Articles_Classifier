For a country that was issuing food coupons as late as 1993 it is too early for such questions. Chinese people care more about per capita GDP because it directly affects their lives, yet that does not mean they do not care about the world. Emerging from an unfair world order, which had its origins in colonialism, they naturally favour a world that is inclusive and just. In this respect, the US-dominated world order does face some challenges. The 2008 global financial crisis exposed the loopholes in global economic governance, the exclusive nature of which has resulted in far more troubles than achievements. Its security canopy is also full of the maladies of group politics. The US places its security interests, and that of its allies, over those of other countries. It offers few methods to address new challenges and, as such, some non-traditional security threats have come to rule the global agenda. Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, has said that today, he thinks most about how much time and space the US has to maintain the current order and conceive the future order. The US is worried China will eventually challenge its leadership. China considers such worries a thing of the past century, as the logic of power struggles is not part of its history and tradition. Besides, China has been a firm supporter of the world order based on the principles and conventions of the United Nations. The second decade of the 17th century saw the beginning of the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. The second decade of the 19th century had the Napoleonic Wars. And the second decade of the 20th century witnessed the First World War. President Xi Jinping wants the modern world to be a community of shared interests and destiny The question is: Can the world find a peaceful coexistence formula for major powers in the second decade of this century? The community needs to think about creating a framework for a more-inclusive global order in which all members have a say. Chinese President Xi Jinping wants the modern world to be a community of shared interests and destiny. Moreover, China has always emphasised the importance of fairness, justice, openness and equality in the world order, which should be realised through gradual and progressive reform. Reaching a consensus on building a new world order may be a lengthy process, but people in the 21st century are knowledgeable and aware enough not to fall into the old trap of power struggles. The new order should safeguard the principles of fairness, equality and justice; address the common problems confronting the world, and meet the new, complicated challenges that have emerged. Building a new and better world order should be the common objective of all countries But it is very important that, as core countries in the reform of the world order, China and the US avoid conflicts in political, security and economic fields by not provoking or unnecessarily criticizing each other. Instead, they should be conscious of the risks, support regional and international organisations such as the UN and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and expedite the process of reaching a consensus on the new world order to promote peace and development. The essence of a good world order is people-to-people communication and understanding. So countries should have broader and deeper dialogues. As a large emerging country, China also needs to publicise its policies and strategic purposes timely and clearly to the world to win more understanding and support. Building a new and better world order should be the common objective of all countries. Only when all countries perform their duties well can the 21st century be a truly peaceful and prosperous century, with people prevented from repeating the mistakes of past centuries.

Greater mutual trust key to successful ties Du Qiwen The depth, breadth and fruitfulness of the seventh China-US Strategic and Economic Dialogue and the sixth China-US High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange were unprecedented and unexpected for observers who were more used to reading reports on disagreements and tension between the two countries. The gap between the spreading negative perception of China-US relations and the often-ignored mutually beneficial nature of their relationship has long been a paradox; more so because China has talked more about the positive sides of the bilateral ties than the United States administration does, not to mention the media. Moreover, the public impression has tended to underestimate the real strength and potential of the bilateral ties, which above all has been the result of the absence of strategic mutual trust. In today’s globalised world, China and the US have large stakes in each other’s success. They have one of the world’s largest trading relationships, with annual trade worth more than $550 billion (£352 billion). The countries have worked together on regional and global issues such as climate change Two-way investment has reached about $100 billion and continues to increase, while about 4.5 million visitors travel between the two countries each year, with a flight between China and the US taking off or landing every 17 minutes. Many Hollywood movies are just as popular in China as they are in North America, and China has even surpassed the US as the biggest market for Apple products. Meanwhile, the two countries have been working together on regional and global issues such as climate change, and as such a win-win partnership, not rivalry, defines their relationship. They are certainly not on a collision course. As the world order undergoes profound changes, China and the US have a responsibility towards their own peoples, as well as the rest of the world, to pursue a stable and healthy relationship. Trust inspires positive expectations, with which major issues can become minor ones The latest strategic and economic dialogue in late June was encouraging precisely because it represented the bilateral relations as they should and will be. Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, has said that strategic trust holds the key to a strong and durable China- US relationship. Trust inspires positive expectations, with which major issues can become minor ones, whereas the absence of trust only invites problems. That is why China is fully committed to working with the US on the issue of mutual trust. The academic communities in both countries also have a vital role to play in building this badly needed trust. As Confucius said: “A wise man cannot be misled.” It is important for experts to be broad-minded, incisive and to not be guided by emotions because their words can have a direct effect on public opinion and policymakers. That is why the downbeat rhetoric used by some big names to describe China-US relations over the past few months has generated special concern among the public. ... as the US presidential campaign intensifies, rhetoric on China will get more aggressive The news media, too, plays a significant role in China-US ties. My friends who work in the American news media have said there is a serious need for more interaction between the two countries’ media. Despite the overwhelming increase in China-related reports, they say, knowledge about China remains inadequate, which often puts things in the wrong perspective. Our American friends say that, as the presidential campaign in the US intensifies, rhetoric on China will get more aggressive, making the domestic environment even harsher for the development of bilateral ties. We are fully aware what election politics means for the US, but we still hope that its political leaders will bear in mind the importance of having a sound relationship with China in the long run and do not do anything to undermine the fragile trust, so that we can together cultivate healthy and stable China-US ties.

WHAT THEY SAY Looking at geopolitics and the shape of things to come Editor’s Note: Comments from the international symposium Shared Security: World Peace and Global Governance, organised by the University of International Relations in Beijing. When China launched its reform and openingup in the late 1970s, it was a marginalised economy with per capita GDP of barely $400 (£250). Now, with per capita GDP of nearly $8,000, it has become the largest trading partner of many countries. Yet for China, the world order is not perfect, as it is supposed to play a bigger role in pioneering new agendas rather than be a passive participant. Holding the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world, China needs to have a bigger say in the global monetary system. The modern maritime law, which does not meet many emerging powers’ requirements, has also made it difficult for China to safeguard regional stability and protect its legal maritime rights. China should keep participating in the reform of the global system for shared security. Wang Yizhou , vice-dean of the School of International Studies, Peking University Washington’s attempts to contain China have proved futile and will not work in this century. Unlike the Soviet Union, China has been engaged in regular economic exchanges with the United States on an equal footing. The American policy of containing China … does not serve the primary interest of countries in the Asia-Pacific. Apart from its declining military expenditure, the United States government has more to deal with at home, such as its isolationism mentality. Moreover, for the United States, which has never succeeded in transforming another country, the most pressing issues are in the Middle East. China, as a beneficiary of the current world order, will not seek to confront the United States. It cannot replace the United States in global and regional governance because it still has to resolve domestic issues. Both countries should honour the new type of major-power relationship espoused by President Xi Jinping … rather than engaging in confrontations. Zhao Suisheng , executive director of the Center for China-US Cooperation, University of Denver The world has faced a slew of grave challenges, including civil wars and poverty, since the end of the Cold War. Unfortunately, global governance has failed many times because of the distance between emerging powers and traditional major powers and the low representation of the former in the global mechanism. The post-war global order has seen two major changes. The first is the decentralisation of power, as efficient global governance largely depends on proper communication and co-operation between emerging economies and major powers. The second is in the scope of security, as the world now faces an increasing number of non-traditional threats, including climate change and epidemics like Ebola, which are as dangerous as traditional ones. The healthy development of the global economy depends on closer co-ordination among all countries, given their increasing interdependence. Qin Yaqing , president of China Foreign Affairs University As a key variable of the ever-changing world order, China-US relations since the beginning of the Cold War in the late 1940s can be divided into three stages. In the first, relations varied mostly according to the direction of the Cold War, yet in the second stage they became a major factor in ending the longstanding East-West confrontation. To some extent, without the reconciliation between China and the United States, it would have taken longer for the latter to claim “victory” in the Cold War. Now, in the third stage, China is the world’s second-largest economy, making the bilateral ties a decisive variable of the future global system. Of course, the reciprocal co-existence might not come easily for both countries, which are likely to end up being “partners based on functionality”. That being said, bilateral ties can remain promising if the two sides properly manage and shelve some differences. Jin Canrong , vice-dean of the School of International Studies, Renmin University of China In Beijing’s experience, a safe and sustainable geopolitical situation can be achieved only through peaceful co-operation between maritime and landlocked countries. In essence their co-operation should be able to forge sound geopolitical ties among countries that favour long-term regional and global development. If all countries in Asia can reach a consensus on geopolitical issues, the number of major strategic confrontations along the Eurasian rim will significantly reduce, making the regions more conducive to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Unlike traditional geopolitical theories, the benign integration of landlocked and coastal states represents an open universal system characterised by reciprocity, inclusiveness and a sustainable security shared by all countries. This will help Beijing’s efforts to implement the Belt and Road Initiative without triggering regional clashes and wars.
