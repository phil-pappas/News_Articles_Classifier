There is only one port of call scheduled for the Faroe Islands next year. \n“We will refrain from further port of calls to the Faroe Islands for now and are currently checking possible alternatives for the scheduled itinerary next year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:20:31.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
