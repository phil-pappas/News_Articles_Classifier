Dancing has played a key role on the programme, especially in scenes showing the younger nurses unwind: the dance group Swing Patrol has featured in a number of episodes alongside the cast. The programme's cast do at least have plenty of time free: the fifth series of the show was filmed earlier this year, with the cast posting pictures of \"another Christmas in May\" as they shot their annual festival episode. Yep. Another Christmas in May :-) Me and @LauraMain1 doing our festive thaaang. #callthemidwife #Series5 pic.twitter.com/odcYu2X0h7 — Stephen McGann (@StephenMcGann) May 11, 2015 It's hard to pick a favourite, although Helen George, who plays vivacious Trixie, is in good shape having run the London Marathon earlier this year. Should a Call the Midwife star join the Strictly dancefloor, it is unlikely to be Miranda Hart, who plays gung-ho nurse Chummy and recently made her Hollywood debut in the hit comedy Spy alongside Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy. In other Strictly news, professional dancers Janette Manrara and Aljaz Skorjanec announced their engagement on Thursday night after three years together. Manrara tweeted \"I said yes!\" along with a picture of the couple shortly after Skorjanec proposed in a restaurant. I said \"YES\"! ?? pic.twitter.com/KB9bUtHDgg — Janette Manrara (@JManrara) August 13, 2015 The announcement came on the day that former Coronation Street actress Georgia May Foote was named as the fourth Strictly contestant .
