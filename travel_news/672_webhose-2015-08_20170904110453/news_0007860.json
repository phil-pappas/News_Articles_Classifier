A drop of delicious juice spills over your lips and traces a wet, sticky trail down your chin.\nNow that’s summer.\nFew experiences are more mind-blowingly sensual than eating a ripe peach bursting with flavor.\nBut that’s a fresh peach, consumed au naturel. What about cooking with peaches? What about using them in savory dishes? Are they still as amazing then?\nMost Read Stories Black Lives Matter protesters shut down Bernie Sanders; later rally draws 15,000 60 years ago: The famous Boeing 707 prototype barrel roll over Lake Washington Seahawks' 53-man roster projection, post-scrimmage edition Seahawks rewarded for sticking to their salary-cap plan Condition of boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert improves Of course they are. Peaches are still peaches, even when placed on top of a pizza.\nSo I put peaches on top of a pizza, where they more than held their own. The secret was my grill.\nUsing a recipe by Martha Stewart, I grilled the sliced peaches before using them as a flatbread topping. I knew that would caramelize the fruit, making it sweeter, but what I did not anticipate was how just a couple of minutes on the grill would give the peach a smoky flavor.\nThat extra blast of smoke (more prominent, actually, than the added sweetness) was the perfect accompaniment to a thin layer of salty, smoky prosciutto. A sprinkling of fresh basil added a heady bite, which nicely cut a rich and creamy layer of mozzarella.\nAnd all of this goodness was perched on top of a grilled pizza crust, or at least it would have been if I had followed Stewart’s recommendation. I wanted something slimmer so the other flavors would stand out more. I wanted to use a grilled flatbread, but just at the critical moment I couldn’t find a suitable version at the store.\nSo I settled on a naan, a thicker-than-flatbread flatbread that is popular in India. I bought three (they come in a three-pack), grilled them and topped them with the peaches, prosciutto, basil and cheese.\nThey were great. The distinct taste of the naan added one more complementary taste to the toppings, but to be perfectly honest a pizza crust would be just as good, or a flatbread or even a pita.\nI wasn’t through with savory uses for peaches. If peaches are one of the ultimate expressions of summer, then tomatoes are another. Put them together, and you’ve got a peach-and-tomato gazpacho.\nOrdinarily, peaches and tomatoes do not play well together. Peaches are sweet, tomatoes are acidic, and the flavors do not meld with ease. But a simple secret brings them together in culinary harmony: Just add salt.\nSalt brings out the sweetness and tempers the acid in many foods including tomatoes (and even peaches). Just a bit or two of salt turns these two competing fruits into the best of friends.\nIt’s even better when you add a dollop of Greek yogurt that has been mixed with diced cucumber, chives and a minced clove of garlic. It all tastes as great as it sounds.\nNaturally, I wanted to use peaches in a dessert, too; dessert is the natural medium for a peach. But I didn’t want to make a pie (too ordinary) or a tart (too commonplace) or even a galette (too much like a pie or a tart).\nAnd that is when I saw a recipe for a fresh peach cake. The recipe is by Ina Garten. It is more of a coffee cake than a cake cake. The batter has sour cream in it — I could just eat the batter all day — along with all the other ingredients that make cake so delectable: butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla and flour. Then it is topped off by a combination of cinnamon, sugar and pecans.\nBut it is the peaches that raise the cake from ordinary to extraordinary. In the middle, adding their sweet moistness, lies a layer of thin-sliced peaches topped with more of the cinnamon and sugar. And on the top is the same.\nTry it with a cup of coffee. Try it with a glass of milk. But try not to eat the whole thing at once by yourself.\nFinally, I decided to take advantage of one of those classic flavor combinations that are not too well known. Peaches go with bourbon. Bourbon goes with peaches. A slice of peach muddled in a glass of bourbon brings out a new and wonderful set of flavors.\nIf one slice of peach and one shot of bourbon is good, how much better would it be to slice up three or four entire peaches and let them steep in a bottle of bourbon for a week or so?\nA not overwhelming amount of sugar, two tablespoons, helped to mellow out the bourbon, and a couple of cloves and allspice berries added their own festive notes.\nWhile it is superb on its own or with a few cubes of ice, this lighter, friendlier version of bourbon also makes exceptional mixed drinks.\nThere is nothing like a drop of peach-infused bourbon spilling over your lips and down your chin.\nFRESH PEACH CAKE\nMakes 12 servings\n1 stick (¼ pound) unsalted butter, room temperature\n1½ cups sugar, divided\n2 extra-large eggs, room temperature\n1 cup sour cream, room temperature\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n½ teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n3 large, ripe peaches, peeled, pitted and sliced\n½ cup chopped pecans\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan. If you use a smaller pan the batter will overflow it while it cooks, so place it on top of a baking sheet with a rim or a larger pan.\n2. Using an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and 1 cup of the sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about three to five minutes. With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time. Add the sour cream and vanilla, and mix until the batter is smooth.\n3. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the batter and mix until just combined. In a small bowl, combine the remaining ½ cup of sugar and cinnamon.\n4. Spread half the batter evenly in the pan. Top with half the peaches, then sprinkle withtwo-thirds of the sugar mixture. Spread the remaining batter on top, arrange the remaining peaches on top, and sprinkle with the remaining sugar mixture and the pecans.\n5. Bake the cake for 45 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n— Recipe by Ina Garten, via Food Network\nPEACH-AND-TOMATO GAZPACHO WITH CUCUMBER YOGURT\nMakes about 8 (1-cup) servings\n5 large peaches, peeled and divided\n3 large tomatoes, cored and divided\n½ cup coarsely chopped sweet onion\n3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\nSalt and white pepper, to taste\n¾ cup finely diced English cucumbers\n1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives, plus more for garnish\n1 garlic clove, minced\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1. Cut four of the peaches and two of the tomatoes into quarters and put in a food processor or blender. Add the sweet onion and vinegar and process until smooth.\n2. Chop remaining peach and tomato. Stir into pureed mixture. Season with salt (if it tastes bitter, the salt will add sweetness) and white pepper to taste. Chill one hour.\n3. Meanwhile, combine cucumber, yogurt and the 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and chill one to 24 hours (chilling can dull the seasoning, so you may need to add more salt and pepper before serving).\n4. Ladle gazpacho into bowls. Spoon cucumber mixture over gazpacho. Drizzle each serving with about 1 teaspoon olive oil and serve immediately.\n— Recipe from Southern Living magazine\nG RILLED PEACH PIZZAS WITH PROSCIUTTO\nMakes 3 (9-inch pizza) servings\n3 pizza dough crusts, or flatbreads, pita or naan\n2 peaches, cut into ½-inch wedges\n1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced\n12 thin slices prosciutto, cut in half\n1/3 cup fresh basil\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling\n1. Heat a grill or grill pan on high heat and grill pizza crusts, flatbreads, pita or naan until grill marks are dark. Set aside and grill peach wedges until caramelized, about two minutes per side.\n2. Preheat oven to 400 degrees, or lower grill temperature to medium. Spread cheese on grilled pizza crusts. Bake or grill (covered with a lid) directly on grates until cheese melts and is bubbling, about eight minutes (time may vary slightly if grilling). Remove from oven or grill. Top with peaches, prosciutto and basil. Drizzle with oil.\n— Recipe from Martha Stewart\nFRESH GEORGIA PEACH BOURBON\nMakes 17 (1½-ounce) servings\n3 to 4 fresh peaches\n2 tablespoons sugar\n2 whole cloves\n3 whole allspice berries\n1 (750 ml) bottle good-quality bourbon\n1.
