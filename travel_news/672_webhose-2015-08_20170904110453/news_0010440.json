As befits its agricultural traditions there are cattle, sheep, poultry and heavy horse judging. With an increased level of both competition and demand in recent years, further classes have been introduced for retrained racehorses, working hunters, native beef breeds, and Zwartbles sheep.\nHorticultural, handicraft and home craft sections also feature, as well as a flower and a vegetable show. A vintage section includes tractors, cars and steam traction engines; with some entrants even travelling in from abroad!\nNewly established three years ago, the Food From Farming marquee attracts many local artisan food producers who offer a huge variety of local produce from pies and preserves to cheese, bread, and meat. | A successful equestrian section, which includes ponies ridden and in-hand, retrained racehorse classes; heavy horses and carriage driving are all very popular with the visitors.\nAround the showground there are hand-carved walking sticks to be seen, sheep dog trials, parading hounds, a dog show and a dry stonewalling demonstration. A local traditional brass band provides a musical sideshow.\nThere is plenty for children to do; a fun fair, face painting, a fancy dress competition and a bouncy castle and leisure area.\nSome 150 outdoor retail and corporate stands, and indoor craft and food stalls, give local traders a chance to entice the 7,000 visitors from all over the North of England to sample their wares. | Licensed facilities, varied hot food outlets and a full buffet type restaurant on site complete the line up.\nShow Chairman Mr Bob Dixon said: “The Wensleydale Show prides itself on being a traditional agricultural show with a big presence of sheep, cattle and poultry classes. The main ring has entertainment all day long with carriage driving, heavy horses, vintage vehicles and hounds as well as a spectacular motorcycle stunt show.”\nEntrance charges are adults £10 with children £5 and under 5s free. A family ticket costs £25 covering 2 adults and up to 3 children. There is an online discount if tickets are pre-booked. The site has free car parking and dogs on leads are allowed on the show field but only working guide dogs are allowed inside any of the marquees.\nMembership of the society at £25 also brings the benefit of three free tickets saving £5 on admission prices and exclusive parking.
