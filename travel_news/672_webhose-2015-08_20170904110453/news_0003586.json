Accordingly, the FCO has updated its advice, which counsels against all but essential travel to the country,” the company said in a statement. \n“In light of these developments, and given that we have no clear indication as to when the FCO travel advice may change, Thomas Cook can confirm that it has taken the decision to cancel all bookings to Tunisia up until 13 February 2016.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T16:30:13.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
