Over the course of 23 days, the guests will undoubtedly forge deep bonds as they share the experience of a lifetime with their fellow globe-trotters. And yet, at each leg of the journey, the individual travelers will choose how to spend their time. They may opt to take part in insider events and excursions carefully crafted by Robb Report editors and on-the-ground experts, or they might explore the magnificent surroundings, bask in their exquisite accommodations, and indulge in culinary pleasures on their own time. Regardless, whether racing Ferraris through the California countryside, finding nirvana at a Balinese spa, yachting off the pink-sand shores of Bermuda, or simply traveling in style from one destination to the next, the passengers will enjoy unsurpassed personal service from the expedition’s dedicated staff of journey managers, flight attendants, chefs, tour guides, and more. \nPre-boarding festivities commence on the evening of Thursday, October 13, 2016, with a celebratory dinner at the legendary Halekulani Hotel in Honolulu.
