The full learning program for the event-- starting with Smart Monday powered by MPI and Association Day on October 12th and running straight through to the show ending October 15th-- is now live on the IMEX America website and is free of charge to all buyers, attendees and exhibitors. \nWith this online catalog of learning opportunities at their fingertips, attendees can research upwards of 180 options with just a few clicks and create their own custom learning program based on their unique needs, interests and IMEX schedules. Over 75 percent of the education is estimated to qualify for CMP/ CEU certification points. Searches can be done under 10 speciality tracks including Business Skills, Creative Learning, Diversity, General Education, Health/Wellbeing, Marketing and Communications, Research/Trends, Risk Management/Compliance, Sustainability, and Technology/Social Media. Education Built for Impact All of the education on the show floor will this year be located at the Inspiration Hub, but recognizing that we all learn in different ways, the space features five distinct learning formats and set-ups. There are seminar rooms, a campfire area and a Hot Topic area providing the opportunity to debate the latest industry issues with peers. The Meet the Experts Clinic offers individual appointments with an industry expert, and presentations at the Research Pod area showcase the latest industry data. Though education sessions are open to all, two new ways to filter session searches -- Young Professionals sponsored by IAEE and Senior Professionals sponsored by SPIN -- have also been created based on number of years in the industry to help attendees pinpoint ideal classes. Those with three years or less in the business might like sessions such as “Six Proven Strategies for High Performing Young Professionals,” delivered by meeting industry pioneers, Susan Sarfati and Liz Jackson of High Performance Strategies. Meeting professionals with more than eight years in the industry may want to join in a discussion such as “Prove it or Lose it: ROI metrics that matter most to the C-Suite,” led by Dane Risley, Senior VP of Enterprise Event Marketing Sales at Cvent. Knowing that keeping up with the lightning pace of technology can be challenging, many “wired” sessions will be offered in Vegas from “Beyond the #hashtag” given by Josh Murray of Extraordinary Events and “Welcome to 2016: Tech you’ve never seen” delivered by Courtney Stanley, marketing & industry relations strategist for EventMobi, to a discussion dubbed “Insights from the C-Suite: How to have 'the talk' about going digital,” led by Deborah Sexton, PCMA President & CEO and Carolyn Clarke, leader of Virtual Edge Institute (VEI.) Data fans will want to visit the Research Pod for topics such as “The Global Exhibition Industry: Trends Worth Watching,” with David Dubois, President & CEO of IAEE. Smart Monday Play Room Features Quirkshops As past IMEX education has explored, the power of creativity and professional play can add a lot of “love” to business results. To further punctuate the theme this year, IMEX America will feature ‘The Play Room’ – sponsored by Play with a Purpose - which will run throughout Smart Monday and offer short ‘quirkshops’. This upbeat, fun alternative to classroom learning lets attendees get hands-on experience with a variety of tools, techniques and resources to create more engaging meetings in the areas of room design, tech, networking, teambuilding, F&B and more. The overall goal of the Play Room is to offer tangible, immediately applicable ideas that planners can build into their upcoming meetings. “We think this year’s line-up of education at IMEX America has something for everyone –from newcomers to industry veterans, from the very analytical to the highly creative, from hosted buyers and exhibitors to students and international participants,” said Carina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group. “Our goal is always to ensure that the education sessions are insightful and practical, with the end result being that learnings can be brought back to the office and put right to work with teammates and clients alike.” Keynotes Start Day Off Right Daily MPI keynotes will lend an intelligent and energizing note to each day of the show. Smart Monday powered by MPI is headlined by wellness expert Lee Papa discussing “How to Live and Lead Mindfully,” followed on Tuesday by Tim David, author, speaker and former magician touching on “Human Connection: A Lost Art in a Noisy World.” Wednesday’s program will begin with a keynote from film director Josh Tickell taking the audience through “Managing and Marketing to the Future Generation Y,” and on the final day of the show Patrick Henry, former songwriter and author of “The Pancake Principle: Seventeen Sticky Ways To Make Your Customers FLIP For You,” will teach skills around “Becoming Remember-able.” Finally, allowing more opportunity for hosted buyers to take advantage of the rich education program - as well as book other appointments and explore the show floor - doors will open this year at 9:45am, with no group appointments held before 11am or after 4pm.
