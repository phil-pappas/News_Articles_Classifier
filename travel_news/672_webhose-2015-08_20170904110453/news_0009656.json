Matti Siivonen, our guide, said the surface disturbance would camouflage the rare animals, relatives to the arctic seal, which have been stranded in freshwater lakes here for 8,000 years. But, he added, spotting seals usually requires more than a week’s stay in Kolovesi National Park , an 18-square-mile wilderness of wooded islands set amid a maze of straits and channels. We were booked for two days. The seals let us down, but the park did not: Kolovesi’s pristine wilderness teems with bird, mammal and fish life. Its numerous islands and islets boast soaring cliffs, forests laden with wild berries and mushrooms, ancient rock formations and caves with prehistoric drawings. The park covers only part of Lake Saimaa, which, at almost 1,700 square miles, is Finland ’s largest lake and Europe’s fourth-largest. It is in the region of Southern Savonia, not far from the Russian border, about 250 miles northeast of Helsinki, Finland’s capital. Photo Most visitors do come to Kolovesi with hopes of spotting the seals, whose ancestors were stranded here when glaciers retreated from the region 12,000 years ago, cutting off their access to the Baltic Sea. The current population of about 300 seals is considered critically endangered, already reduced over the centuries by hunting, net fishing and climate change . Kolovesi was created in 1990 to help save the animals, which are monitored by local and international authorities, as are the flat lakeside rocks where they loll in the sun and build their dens. This visit involved canoeing through one of the park’s protected areas, the red outline on maps indicating Jet Skis, snowmobiles and motorboats are forbidden to protect the tranquility and to ensure ideal mating conditions for the seals. We met Mr. Siivonen at one of the several park sites with boat ramps, campfire pits and other amenities, in various combinations. He and his brother, Jouko, run Kolovesi Retkeily , a company that mostly provides canoes for self-guided tours but also helps guests plan excursions and book stays in the park’s two rental cabins. A short while later the elusive seals slipped from my mind as we approached Ukonvuori, an impressive 165-foot-high forested mound of granite named for the Finnish god of thunder, one of Kolovesi’s main attractions. From the canoe, we craned our necks to look up at the ragged cliff faces as we drifted past boulders the size of S.U.V.s. In some spots, slabs of rock appeared to shoot vertically out of the water. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Siivonen said that for millions of years the landscape had been gouged and gouged again by glaciers, causing the earth’s surface to rise, buckle and twist. Some of the exposed bedrock in the park is 1.8 billion years old — a number that is not easy to comprehend, especially when you’re busy scanning the water for seal heads. On Ukonvuori, Mr. Siivonen led the way up a wooden staircase to a cavelike opening in a craggy cliff face and a 4-inch-tall figure of a dancing hunter-gatherer drawn in red iron oxide. The image is one of numerous prehistoric rock paintings in and around the park, whose waterways have been vital hunting and fishing channels for thousands of years. The guide also pointed out some other remains of human activity: spots where tree stumps had been used to make tar to seal wooden ship hulls as far back as the 1600s and boulders the size of kitchen tables that until the late 1800s had served as altars to nature gods. During the stop, we met Vesa Nystrom and his wife, Lilli, who were ushering their sons, Leo and Otso, out of a green canoe. I asked what had prompted them to drive about six hours from their home in Turku, in southwest Finland. Was it the rock paintings, the lakes, the forests — or maybe the seals? “The seals?” said Mr. Nystrom, his face breaking into a wide smile. “That’s the real reason we’re here.” (They hadn’t seen any.) Back in the canoe, we learned that the 69-year-old Mr. Siivonen, a genteel and remarkably spry man in a felt fedora adorned with raven and crane feathers, had grown up just outside the park. He shared memories of white summer nights spent exploring Ukonvuori, and pushing boulders over its sheer cliffs. “We were outside a lot,” he said. “At home we had no electricity; only battery-operated radios.” (Electricity didn’t come to the area until 1975, he said.) He then pointed out an area of steep rocky shoreline where, he said, he and his friends would hurl themselves into the deep water below. The silence that followed was broken only by the call of a nearby wood warbler and the lapping of the water against the oars. As the day wore on, Mr. Siivonen pointed out wild Finnish orchids, an osprey circling its nest, a beaver lodge, moose scat and logs hollowed out by grub-seeking bears. We saw — and heard — some of the many bird species in the park, and Mr. Siivonen explained that in addition to pike, zander and vendace, the lake contains endangered fish and shrimp species that have, like the seals, been landlocked here since the Ice Age. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He promised, once we’d settled in for the night, to let us sample his smoked muikku, tiny whitefish from the lake that are a big hit with Finns — and the seals. Once we reached Mr. Siivonen’s summer cabin on the shores of Mantysalo, one of the park’s largest islands, he began preparing a smoke sauna for us to enjoy after dinner. Smoke saunas are the original form of the sauna experience, dating to the days before modern wood-burning stoves and electric heaters. Some enthusiasts still prefer them. To prepare it, Mr. Siivonen built a small fire in a pit topped with rocks inside his wooden sauna hut. Once the rocks were heated through, the fire was left to die and the smoke was allowed to escape the hut. When we went inside, we threw water on the hot rocks to produce the sauna steam. While the rocks were heating, Mr. Siivonen paddled us to the foot of a nearby ridge, where we could look out over the sweeping landscape of islets scattered across the jewel-blue water. The view at our feet was equally spectacular: I counted five moss varieties in shades of green ranging from bottle and lime to kelly and sage. There also was a marshy forest clearing awash in cloudberry, a cold-climate fruit that resembles a gold raspberry. Though few were ripe enough to eat, Mr. Siivonen found a couple that offered up the berry’s unusual combination of tart taste and nutty sweetness. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story We had cloudberries in a cake that followed a dinner of moose steaks, in a woodsy, sweet marinade that Mr. Siivonen refused to divulge. Then we relaxed, alternating between soothing sauna steam and dips in the lake, whose surface had calmed to mirrorlike perfection. And there was muikku, Mr. Siivonen’s home-smoked fish, to replace the salt we’d lost while sweating. Sleep came quickly but not for long: At 4 a.m., I awoke and walked to the lake to watch columns of thick mist drifting across its glassy surface. The next morning, my shoulder muscles sore and my eyes still raw from sauna smoke, we hit the water again. The lake was calm; it should have been perfect for seal-spotting. Despite my disappointment — or perhaps because of it — Mr. Siivonen shared his favorite seal stories. Once, while he was building his house, a seal emerged from the water and nonchalantly positioned himself in the sun, alongside a blaring radio. Another time, when Mr. Siivonen was ice fishing, a seal emerged from a hole in the ice and casually nursed her pup. “They are curious animals,” he said. “Sometimes they like to come and see what you are doing.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T08:27:10.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
