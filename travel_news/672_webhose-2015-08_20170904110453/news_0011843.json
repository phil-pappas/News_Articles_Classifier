Why should Blue Line Arts' acquisition of the Arts & Business Council's assets matter to Sacramento’s business community? It’s all about the region’s economy. The business sector relies on the arts sector for a variety of reasons, such as executive recruitment, employee hiring and attracting (or keeping) companies.

Sign In Here When the Arts & Business Council of Sacramento began to unravel last year because of funding challenges, Blue Line Arts saw a two-fold business opportunity. First, by acquiring ABC’s programs and assets — mostly in the form of good will — Blue Line could preserve some very solid programs. And an added benefit would be to increase Blue Line’s footprint as a regional arts hub, a process that’s been underway for the past couple of years. Based in Placer County, Blue Line has twice hosted the prestigious Crocker-Kingsley exhibit and created an art show for the Sutter Club, a Sacramento institution. The acquisition was finalized last week. Blue Line Arts will now oversee — with assistance from Michelle Alexander , the former executive director of ABC — these programs: Prelude to the Season, a popular annual awards show that highlights the connection between the arts and business communities. It will return in February 2016. Flywheel, an “incubator” that mentors artists and art organizations on practical business skills. The program will re-launch in late 2016. A new program, sponsored by Sacramento Regional Transit, that will see local artists submit and execute designs to enhance the exterior of RT buses as public art-in-motion. So why should this matter to Sacramento’s business community? It’s all about the region’s economy. The business sector relies on the arts sector for a variety of reasons, such as executive recruitment, employee hiring and attracting (or keeping) companies. Quality-of-life issues play a serious role in economic development. In short, a strong arts sector contributes to a strong business sector. How much? Every day, more than 100,000 nonprofit arts and culture organizations act as economic drivers — creating an industry that supports jobs, generates government revenue and supports our tourism industry. Blue Line Arts operates on a very lean budget of $360,000. That yields an estimated $1.1 million in regional spending by audiences and the organization. It also will generate $141,000 in revenue to local and state government as a result of the programming of the combined organizations. The acquisition of ABC strengthens the regional arts sector, allowing it to conserve, collaborate, and consolidate services and resources in order to provide more effective outcomes. Our affiliation with Sacramento shouldn’t be viewed as a casual foray or aggressive campaign. The Sacramento-centric programs Blue Line Arts has acquired will remain that way. We already have a full array of programs at Blue Line in our Roseville location — including children and adult art programs; a music series; lectures; and local, regional, national and even international art exhibits. Stop by and see us. The future of art in the capital region should be a top priority for businesspeople, artists and families.
