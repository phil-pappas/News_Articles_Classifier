Born in Honolulu in 1916, Pualani Mossman danced hula at the opening of Matson’s Royal Hawaiian Hotel in 1927, was picked by the Hawaii Tourist Bureau to appear in the first color movie filmed in Hawaii, 1934’s “Song of the Islands,” and in 1937 was photographed by Anton Bruehl for a nation Matson ad campaign with a red hibiscus in her hair. She became known as the “Matson girl” from then on, and continued to dance hula in Hawaii and her later home in Florida until her death at age 89. The image of a woman with a flower in her hair on Hawaiian Airlines’ planes is also called Pualani. © Matson When you think of traveling to Hawaii, what do you see? An exotic tropical destination, a glamorous resort, a playground for ocean adventure or the cradle of a vibrant ancient culture, now part of an intoxicating mix with later arrivals? Perhaps it’s a combination of these images, and more, with a helping of whatever the latest media campaign (e.g. #LetHawaiiHappen) wants you to envision.\nWhile many in California now have strong family ties or memories of frequent vacations in the Hawaiian Islands, the Aloha State was more of a blank slate to most when the Matson Navigation Company began promoting passenger travel to Hawaii more than a century ago.\nAlthough the company had been sailing to Hawaii since 1882, its role in expanding tourism really began in 1908, with the 51-passenger Lurline. In 1927, Matson opened the Royal Hawaiian hotel and introduced the much-larger luxury liner S.S. Malolo, then the fastest ship in the Pacific. That led to the construction of three more “white ships”—Lurline, Monterey and Mariposa—by 1932.\nTo entice Mainlanders to fill all these ships heading to the islands, Matson hired a San Francisco ad agency to create an “ambitious and enduring” advertising campaign, which shaped tourists’ impressions of the islands for decades, according to Matson archivist Lynn Blocker Krantz. Krantz has assembled a variety of Matson travel posters and memorabilia from 1935 to 1941 for “The Travel to Hawaii Ads” exhibition (see gallery above), on view at the Royal Hawaiian through April 2016.\n“Matson's travel ads are like a porthole to the past — seeing what women wore,” said Krantz. “I loved curating this exhibit and reading the ad copy. ‘The Royal Hawaiian Smile’ and the ‘Matson Poster Girl Pualani Mossman’ say it all: ‘Welcome to Hawaii, Aloha!’ It's difficult not to be happy whenever I look at these ads.”\nAppearing in national magazines such as Vogue, Time, National Geographic, the New Yorker, House and Garden, the focus of the ads changed over the 1930s, according to Krantz. Initially, the ads highlighted the Hawaiian-style vacation that began as soon as passengers boarded one of the luxury liners. But by 1937, ad agency Bowman, Duet, Cummings, Inc., chose to feature the experience of being in Hawaii itself, including a stay at a Matson hotel, by then also including the Moana Hotel and the Moana Cottages as well as the “Pink Palace” in Waikiki.\nAnd by the 1940s, the focus had shifted again, judging by a recently discovered, Matson promotional film called “Let’s Go to Alohaland: Romantic Hawaii,” on view through Oct. 25 at Filoli in Woodside, the former estate of the Matson heirs. Curator Julie Bly DeVere first heard about it while working on an unrelated project with the film restoration team of the California Pioneers of Santa Clara County.\nThe 29-minute film, which now screens continuously in Filoli’s Hawaii-themed Ship Room , appears to include footage from 1940 to 1953, according to DeVere. “It features a cruise onboard the Lurline leaving San Francisco and arriving in Oahu (and) then shows all of the common tourist day trips that were available at the time,” she noted.\n“My favorite memory from this exhibit will always be watching it with Mrs. Lurline Matson Roth Coonan at our 2015 Flower Show opening gala,” DeVere added. “At age 94, she was clear as a bell remembering all of the fun memories of her and her twin sister Bren in Oahu. She remembered where they learned to hula and used to go surfing. How beautiful the hula dancers were out on the lawn in front of the hotel. She remembered the grand opening of each of the hotels that her father had built. Every change of location brought forth another gem of a memory.”\nWhat gems of memories do the vintage images in the above gallery make you recall?\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.filoli.org/", "http://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Aloha-spirit-thrives-at-Filoli-6191985.php"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:02:05.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
