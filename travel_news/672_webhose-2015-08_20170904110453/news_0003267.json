Flying a kite that interferes with public traffic \nYou can get a fine of up to US$5000 if you happen to be flying a kite or \"playing any game\" that gets in the way of traffic in any public road. \n4. Singing \nIf you're caught singing or uttering songs that have either obscene lyrics or obscene \"ballads\" in any public place, you'll face a punishment of imprisonment for up to three months, a fine, or even both. \n5. Spitting \nSpitting isn't the classiest act, but do it in any public place in Singapore — including coffee shops, markets, eating houses, school houses, theatres, public buildings, omnibuses, or public roads — and you'll be slapped with a fine of up to US$1000. \n6. Distribution of \"obscene\" materials \nThe distribution of any materials deemed \"obscene\" is prohibited in Singapore. Any violation of this — whether it is photographs, a DVD, books, or figures — can get you up to three months in jail, a fine, or both. \n7. Connecting to another user's Wi-Fi \nSingapore's Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act defines using another person's Wi-Fi network as hacking. If you're caught doing the deed, you can be fined a whopping $US10,000, face up to three years in jail, or both. \n8. Forgetting to flush the toilet \nWhile flushing a public toilet is common courtesy, in Singapore, there is an actual law against it. If you're caught leaving without flushing the toilet, you're looking at a fine of around US$150. \n9. Walking in the nude at home \nWandering around your house nude with any open curtains can land you a fine of US$2000, imprisonment for three months, or both. Both being nude in public and being nude in a private place where you are exposed to the public are considered public nuisances. \n10. Feeding pigeons \nYou might not think it's a big deal to toss your leftover sandwich bread to pigeons, but think twice when you're in Singapore because feeding the birds here will cost you US$500. \n11. Urinating in a public elevator \nIn Singapore, some public elevators come equipped with Urine Detection Devices that set off an alarm and close the doors when any odour or urine is detected until the police arrive. \n12. Littering \nYou shouldn't litter in any country and it isn't uncommon for littering to be against the law, but in Singapore, you'll find yourself paying a US$1000 fine for it. \n13. Graffiti \nIn Singapore, vandalism can get you both arrested and caned . Singapore's vandalism laws first shocked the media in 1994, after an American teenager received a caning as punishment for destroying cars and public property. Earlier this year, two men visiting the country also faced prison time and caning for painting graffiti on a public train. \n14. Taking drugs before you enter the country \nPenalties for drug possession in Singapore range from fines as high as US$20,000 to 10 years in prison . In certain cases, if the amount of the drug is high enough, the punishment can even be a death penalty. Singapore officials have the right to conduct anonymous drug tests without a warrant, so any drugs taken before you enter the country can still put you at risk. \n15. Same-sex relations \nAttempts were made last year to change the Singaporean laws which forbid two members of the same gender from being able to have sexual relations, but unfortunately the regulation still stands. The punishment for gay sex in Singapore is a two-year jail term. \n16. Jaywalking \nIn Singapore, jaywalking is defined as crossing the road within 50 metres of a crossing zone. Jaywalkers can receive a US$20 fine on the spot, a fine of up to US$1000, or three months of jail time. The punishment doubles to a fine of up to US$2000 and six months in jail if you're caught jaywalking twice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:11:32.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
