The passengers will be asked to produce a printed copy of the E-Visa upon check-in. \nIf they do not have the required visa, they will not be permitted to travel. \nTravelers can apply for their E-Visa via www.evisa.go.ke . The website is mobile phone-enabled which means the visitors can complete the application from an internet-enabled mobile phone. The system also accepts photos taken and uploaded from a mobile phone. \nPlease note, the website is currently only offered in English although other language versions are being planned. \nAlternatively, travelers can also contact nearest Kenyan Embassy/High Commission/Consulate. \nTravel agents or tour operators will be able to register and make visa applications on their clients' behalf. \nApplications are currently being approved within 24 hrs. However, efforts are being made to cater for “last-minute” travelers to allow an instant ‘real time’ approval process. E-Visa will be valid for 90 days from the date of approval and not from the date of arrival in Kenya. \nVisitors should therefore ensure the visa will still be valid at the time of travel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:23:02.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
