He played against his coach and Malin Pettersson, a 14-time Swedish tennis table champion, among others. The New York Palace will screen the U.S. Open at its courtyard for the duration of the tournament. The table that Rafa himself played on will also stay for guests and the public to play while watching the Open.\n\"We're celebrating a wink to the playfulness of the U.S. Open,\" says John Tolbert, managing director of the New York Palace. \"The U.S. Open and New York go hand and hand.\"\nHoney Deuces all around\nGrey Goose, one of the sponsors of the Open, has created the Honey Deuce cocktail for the event. It contains fresh lemonade, Chambord, honeydew melon balls and vodka, of course.\nThe InterContinental New York Times Square will serve the cocktail at its hotel lounge, Ca Va Brasserie, during viewings of the tournament.\nThe Bar at Clement at the Peninsula New York will also serve the drink. Guests who buy a bottle of champagne at the bar or in Gotham Lounge will also receive a dozen oysters. A half bottle of prosecco or champagne will get you half a dozen oysters.\nOther hotels serving the drink include the Westin New York at Times Square.\nThe cocktail typically goes for $15.\nFOR THE WIN\nRafael Nadal's abs star in steamy new commercial\nMatch point at the Westin New York at Times Square\nEach night from Aug. 31 to Sept. 10, the Westin New York at Times Square will present Match Point Hour, an evening match viewing series featuring experiential activities.

A U.S. Tennis Association pro will be available for complimentary consultations.\nA virtual Wii tennis station will be set up when guests want to take a break from watching the tournament.\nFinally, Bar 10 will offer a U.S. Open spin on the Westin SuperFoodsRx bar menu with items such as the Ace Turkey BLT.\nTune into tennis at the W New York\nIf you're staying at the W New York , you'll have ample opportunity to watch the Open.
