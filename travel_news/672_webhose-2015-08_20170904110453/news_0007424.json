(Bettina Hansen / The Seattle Times) “This was a tragic incident, and our hearts go out to their families, friends and colleagues,” said Mike Williams, the Forest Supervisor for the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.\nThe Forest Service has called in a national Incident Management Team to investigate the deaths of the firefighters.\nZbyszewski was from the small town of Carlton, Okanogan County. His Facebook page indicates he was active in drama classes and had been a lifeguard at Wagner Memorial Pool in Twisp.\nCollege President Kathy Murray sent an email Thursday notifying the “Whitman Community” of Zbyszewski’s death.\n“I am deeply saddened to share the news that one of our students, Thomas Zbyszewski, was one of the three firefighters who died on Wednesday in the line of duty while serving on a five-person Forest Service engine crew battling the Twisp Fire in Okanogan County, near his hometown of Carlton, Washington,” Murray wrote.\nMurray described Zbyszewski as a junior physics major who was “very involved in the Theatre Department.”\nMost recently, Murray wrote, Zbyszewski portrayed the Mushroom King in the Instant Play Festival, Rusty in the “Junglers” (The One Act Play Contest) and the son in “Three Tall Women.”\nHe also had “a passion for the Chinese language and loved Whitman,” the email said.\nDavid Dinsmore III, on his Facebook Quote: : “I worked with Tom Zbyszewski for two summers as a lifeguard in Twisp. Tom was one of a kind and I would find myself talking and laughing with him for hours on end. He was an incredibly intelligent young man and someone I looked up to.\n“Rest in Peace my friend, you were loved by many more than you could’ve ever known.”\nZajac lived in Winthrop, in Okanogan County, and was a wildland firefighter with the Forest Service (USFS). Originally from Illinois, he received a degree in biology from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 2010 and a master’s of science degree from the University of South Dakota in 2014, according to his LinkedIn page.\nZajac was a two-year starter at right tackle for Case Western’s football team, and was named an honorable mention to the all-university athletic association team during his senior year in 2009.\nHe had previously worked as firefighter in New Mexico.\nWheeler, a 10-year veteran seasonal firefighter in the Okanogan, was working on a career in public-land management, said his father-in-law, Doug Gruber. Wheeler had married Gruber’s daughter, Celeste, in 2013 and lived in South Haven, Mich., during the offseason. They did not have children, Gruber said.\nWheeler had just graduate from Grand Valley State College in Allendale with a degree in natural resources, Gruber said.\nThe Lyon family gathered at Harborview on Wednesday night and stood vigil by his bedside. The injured firefighter’s older brother believed Lyon “could register” that they were all there.\n“Oh man, he’s a good kid all around. He’s definitely the favorite child,” said Levi Lyon, 35, of Tacoma\nRichard Lyon has mostly third-degree burns on half to two-thirds of his body, according to Dr. Tam Pham, a University of Washington Medicine surgeon and burn-trauma specialist. He is undergoing the resuscitative phase, which involves replacing fluid. Depending on how things progress, he may move to the operative phase by Friday.\nHe will have a long road toward recovery, Pham said.\nLyon, a Rogers High School graduate and a reserve officer for the Milton Police Department, signed up to fight wildfires simply because he wanted to help, Levi Lyon said Thursday.\n“His hope and dream was to be a police officer,” he said. “He was doing some forest firefighting to get some extra work. He was trying to help out a good cause.”\nRichard Lyon is the youngest of three children. The siblings grew up in Puyallup. Their parents, a truck driver father and a schoolteacher mother, recently moved to Montana, where they had recently built their dream house.\nThis was Lyon’s first wildfire fighting season, his parents, Daniel and Barbara Lyon, said a news conference Thursday afternoon at Harborview.\nHe would call his parents every day and tell them not to worry, that things were going well.\n“He talked about the exhilaration,” Daniel Lyon said. “When you’re young, you only talk about the good aspects.”\nWashington State Patrol troopers and the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office were at the scene of the fatalities, which involved an initial-attack crew in a truck Wednesday on state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) land near Twisp.\nOkanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said Thursday that the dead and injured firefighters were part of the same crew. He confirmed that there had been a vehicle accident, but he said that it appeared at this point that the deaths and injuries were fire-related.\nHe declined to say whether any of the firefighters were able to deploy their emergency fire shelters.\nSheriff’s detectives were processing the scene and would oversee the removal of the remains later Thursday, the sheriff said. The USFS and local fire agencies would be responsible for determining how the deaths occurred.\nRogers said further details would be released by the Forest Service.\nAt a news conference Thursday morning, Gov. Jay Inslee said the wildfires have “burned a big hole in our state’s heart.”\nIn the meantime, the Forest Service had called in reinforcements to battle the Twisp fire, Forest Service spokeswoman Shoshona Pilip-Florea said.\nTwo Incident Management Teams — the highest level of wildfire-coordination teams — were en route to Twisp.\nOne of the teams will assist with fighting the complex of fires that has burned more than 30,000 acres, and the second will investigate the fire deaths.\nThe Forest Service also initiated its “critical response protocol” for the incident, which deploys a team to conduct an analysis of what led to the fatalities as a prevention learning tool, Pilip-Florea said.\nThe agency also coordinated crisis liaisons to assist families of the dead and injured firefighters, as well as Forest Service employees affected by the tragedy.\n“We have a critical incident stress-management team coming in for support,” she said.\nIn Twisp, which remains under mandatory evacuation, Public Lands Commissioner Peter Goldmark described the fire as having “pretty explosive growth.”\nGoldmark said winds are expected to be gusting again Thursday, to “make things extremely difficult” for firefighters.\nGiven the deaths of the firefighters, Goldmark said people shouldn’t undertake “heroic” acts just to save buildings.\n“It’s a grim reminder of how dangerous it is” to fight such fires, he said Thursday.\nThis season, 13 people have died battling wildfires, including the three in Washington, said Jessica Gardetto of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. She said it was a high number but could not immediately compare it to other years.\n“Our firefighting personnel have been particularly hard hit this year,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, calling it an “extraordinarily challenging wildfire season.”\nSeattle Times staff reporters Mike Carter, Paige Cornwell, Steve Miletich, Jennifer Sullivan, Lewis Kamb, Joseph O’Sullivan and Ángel González contributed to this story, which includes information from The Associated Press.
