An increase in international prices of bovine meat offset a decline for pig meat and ovine meat, while prices for poultry remained stable. \nThe trade-weighted index tracks prices on international markets of five major food commodity groups: cereals, meat, dairy products, vegetable oils and sugar. \nIn July, says FAO, the dairy price index dropped 7.2 percent from the previous month, mainly due to lower import demand from China, the Middle East and North Africa amid abundant EU milk production which has resulted in good availability of dairy products for export. As for the July vegetable oil price index, it was some 5.5 percent below its June level, reaching its lowest value since July 2009. \nThe recent slide was primarily caused by a fall in international palm oil prices due to increased production in Southeast Asia combined with slower exports especially from Malaysia. Another reason is a further weakening of soy oil prices on ample supplies for export in South America and a favourable outlook for global supply in 2015/16. \nThe cereal price index rose by 2.0 percent from June, but was still 10.1 percent below July last year's level. For the second consecutive month, higher wheat and maize prices, in part due to unfavourable weather in North America and Europe, kept the cereal index rising, but rice prices continued to fall. \nThe sugar price index rose by 2.5 percent from June 2015, largely due to less than ideal harvesting conditions in the main producing region of Brazil.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:26.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
