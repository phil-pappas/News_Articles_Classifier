The park has water rides, traditional fairground style attractions such as a carousel and swing rides, an animal barn and numerous play areas (indoor and outdoor). There’s something to keep most children entertained, but there’s probably most for the under 12s. • The ultimate guide to the UK's theme parks What's new Standing at 12 metres high, with 310 metres of winding track, the Twister rollercoaster is Crealy Devon’s largest ride and will offer something extra for older children (there's a minimum 1.2m height restriction). Thumbs up A trip to the pleasant Wilderness Area, which is essentially a woodland nature trail which runs alongside a stream, is a nice way to balance out the excitement of the rides. It offers children a chance to let off steam, crossing rickety bridges and playing in the tree-house hideouts. Information signs about the surrounding flora and fauna encourage children to stop and look at the natural world around them. While there is a respectable amount to do at the theme park, it’s a manageable size, making repeat trips to favourite rides a breeze. On our visit, the staff were unfailingly friendly and helpful. • 50 great days out in the UK Thumbs down Food offerings are dominated by fried chicken (a children’s chicken nugget meal deal costs £4.95), burgers (around £4.25) and pizza (an all-you-can-eat buffet costs £9.50 for adults; £6.50 for children aged 4-12; £3.50 for infants). For something more inspiring, a picnic in the capacious grounds, which have a lake and countryside views, is a good alternative and offers over-excited children a chance to wind down away from the action. Top tips If you have a specific must-do ride or attraction on your list, it’s worth contacting the park to check if it’s running - certain rides are not available year-round or may be closed for maintenance. Some rides have height restrictions making them unsuitable for very young or short children. Check the website in advance for specifics. Pack a change of clothes if you’re planning to go on the water rides. The “7 days of fun for the price of 1” deal offers excellent value for money. Buy your ticket online in advance and validate it at Guest Services for entry to the park on that day and the following six.
