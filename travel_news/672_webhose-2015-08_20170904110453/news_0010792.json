We are joining in the change reshaping our country,” said a message posted to the Twitter account of McDonald’s Guatemala.\n“This is a historic march. The president is a coward who no longer represents national unity,” said student Iván Castillo.\nThe Guatemalan Comptroller General’s office said it would allow employees to leave work for the march.\nIt urged Pérez Molina to step down, saying he must go “to preserve the peace in Guatemala in the face of demands from diverse sectors of the population.”\nThat came hours after the Public Prosecutor’s Office called on him to resign “to stave off the inability to govern that national instability could cause.”\nElsewhere in Guatemala, protesters blocked highways with picket lines, shutting down at least 10 major roads in the north and west of the country.\nGraft hotline\nThe scandal was first uncovered by a United Nations commission set up to investigate high-level corruption in the Central American country.\nU.N. investigators say Pérez Molina, ex-vice president Roxana Baldetti and a raft of other top officials operated a scheme in which businesses paid bribes to clear their imports through customs at a fraction of the actual tax rate.\nThe scandal has been dubbed “La Línea,” for the hotline investigators say importers would call to access corrupt officials.\nBaldetti, who resigned in May, has been arrested and charged with siphoning off some $3.8 million between May 2014 and April 2015.\nA judge ruled Wednesday that she must remain in jail pending trial.\nThe probe has also netted the head of Guatemala’s Tax Administration, his predecessor and several dozen other agency officials.\nThe heads of the central bank and Social Security Administration were also arrested in May over a separate corruption case uncovered by the U.N. commission.\nThe scandal has prompted an exodus from Pérez Molina’s Cabinet as ministers seek to distance themselves from the president.\nSix of his 14 ministers have resigned in recent days, along with several other top officials.\nPérez Molina has not been seen in public for five days.\nWith many Guatemalans exasperated with their political leaders, some have called to postpone the elections until sweeping reforms are implemented in the country of 15 million people, 53.7 percent of whom live in poverty.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/ExySYaAKwD", "https://twitter.com/McGuate/status/636937899846574080", "http://cicig.org/"], "published": "2015-08-28T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:55:43.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
