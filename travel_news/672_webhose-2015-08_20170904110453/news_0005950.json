The captain made the decision to return to Larnaca at around 11pm yesterday UK time due to a fault with the air conditioning system.\n'Customers would have felt the cabin become much warmer as a result – this is due to the body heat of that many people in an enclosed space.\n'Subsequently, we’ve pulled out all the stops to ensure the customers were taken care of really well. All customers were put up in hotels overnight – mostly in the Hilton – and provided with all meals and drinks.\nPassengers returned to Larnaca Airport less than three hours after setting off\nPeter Briant was not even confident the passengers would return to the UK today\n'They have remained in the hotels all day today and are about to be picked up to return to the airport to check-in again while the air conditioning fault is repaired.\n'They will receive vouchers for food and drink at the airport when they arrive and they will be provided with complementary food and refreshments during the flight. Any additional charges, such as parking, that have been incurred at Gatwick as a result of the delay, will be refunded.\n'The departure time from Larnaca will be mid-afternoon UK time.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1McI7rP"], "published": "2015-08-06T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:48:29.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
