It’s part of this city’s cultural and vital transportation fabric.” \nAngels Flight has been idle for nearly two years since a partial derailment in which no one was injured caused federal regulators to close it. Its boosters say Angels Flight is now in safe working order but is unable to legally operate until the state regulatory agency gives the okay. Mayor Garcetti and the MTA are actively exploring solutions. \nBecause of the prolonged closure and subsequent operational revenue shortfall, the board of directors of the nonprofit 501(c)(3) Angels Flight Railway – a group of philanthropic business leaders – has cited expenses ranging from insurance to routine maintenance needs, which need to be met in order to keep the iconic train from being shuttered permanently. \nAdele Yellin, chairman of the railway’s board and owner of the adjacent Grand Central Market, an anchor in the continuing renaissance of downtown Los Angeles, said, “Angels Flight is a crucial connector in this city – literally and figuratively – to the past, present and future. \n“It has meant so much to so many generations of Angelenos that we simply have to save it. It’s part of this city’s cultural and vital transportation fabric.” \nThe outreach has already received a $10,000 matching grant from The David Bohnett Foundation in addition to others from The Yellin Company, CIM Group, Beacon Capital, The Omni Hotel, Jerry M. Givens and downtown activist Hal Bastian. \nAngels Flight dates back to 1901 when Bunker Hill was one of the most fashionable neighborhoods in Los Angeles; and the cars, Olivet and Sinai, ferried prominent citizens up and down the steep slope between Hill and Olive streets. The beloved landmark was dismantled for “urban renewal” of the area in 1969. In the early 1990s, the railway was refurbished and relocated a half block south, reopening adjacent to California Plaza in 1996. As short as it is (298 feet), Angels flight is considered by many a quintessential Los Angeles experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:42:53.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
