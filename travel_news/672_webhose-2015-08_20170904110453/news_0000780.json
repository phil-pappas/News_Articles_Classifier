It recommends that the Department of Transportation, which has the power to investigate and prohibit “unfair or deceptive” practices in the airline industry, investigate whether bag fees should be tied to actual costs incurred by an airline. >> Related story: Airline fees take off \nThe report also says that five airlines surveyed by committee staff — United, Delta, American, Hawaiian and Spirit — charge consumers a flat fee for changing or canceling a ticket no matter how far in advance of a flight the changes are made. Further, it’s very hard for consumers to find information on airline websites on the cost of change and cancellation fees, the report said. \n“The traveling public is being nickel-and-dimed to death,” said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee’s top Democrat. “What’s worse is that many fliers don’t learn about the actual cost of their travel until it’s too late.” \nNelson said he intends to press his colleagues to act on the report’s recommendations when the Senate begins its work on legislation reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:46:34.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
