Red Rocks Park in Morrison — home to one of the nation's best-known outdoor music venues — and the nearby camp used by Great Depression-era conservation workers have been designated a national historic landmark. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis announced the designation today for Red Rocks and three other U.S. sites. Landmark status \"recognizes the sites as places that possess exceptional value and quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States,\" the announcement said. Ownership of the sites does not change, but they are eligible for technical preservation assistance. The natural amphitheater at Red Rocks has hosted concerts for more than a century, with local entrepreneur John Brisben Walker staging performances there between 1906 and 1910. But the venue was greatly improved during the 1930s and early '40s by crews from the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Depression-era federal program created under President Franklin D. Roosevelt that employed out-of-work Americans on outdoor projects. The CCC opened a camp at Red Rocks in 1935, and its crews made major improvements to Red Rocks Amphitheatre and other sites in the Denver Mountain Parks system. Fourteen of the camp's original 15 buildings still stand, making it one of the most intact CCC camps in the nation. The camp is home to a small museum that is open by appointment; call 720-865-0900 for information. The park's Santa Fe-style Trading Post store — also the new home of the Colorado Music Hall of Fame — was designed by W.R. Rosche and opened in 1931. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper hailed today's announcement. “This designation reinforces Red Rocks Park and its remarkable landscape of red sandstone monoliths as a true icon for Colorado,\" he said in a statement. “It’s renowned as the only naturally-occurring, acoustically perfect amphitheater in the world, and the diverse landscape attracts thousands of outdoor enthusiasts and even dinosaur fans. The Mount Morrison CCC camp is another historical treasure in the park, and one of the few surviving camps in the nation. It’s the perfect time to rediscover the park, see a show under the stars, and enjoy all it has to offer.” Red Rocks is Colorado's 25th designated national historic landmark. Others include the Bent's Old Fort replica in La Junta, the Central City-Black Hawk historic district and Denver Civic Center. Here's a full list . Here is the description of the site issued by federal officials today: \"The outstanding architecture and landscape architecture of Red Rocks Park and Mount Morrison Civilian Conservation Corps Camp illustrate the principles and practices of New Deal-era naturalistic park design and master planning in a metropolitan park as well as the use of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) labor to develop such a park. Mount Morrison CCC Camp is one of the few surviving camps in the nation that retains a high concentration of original resources. The amphitheater in the park is one of America’s best known performing arts venues, famous for its natural acoustics, design, and setting.\" \nWant Denver Travel   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:53:35.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
