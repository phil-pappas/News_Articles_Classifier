Regarding the results in the first half of 2015, Mr. Lee Ka Shing, Miramar Group's Chairman and CEO, said, \"The Group's ability to quickly adapt to changes in market conditions and a portfolio of businesses in different industries have served the Group well in an environment characterized by uncertainties and volatility. The Group rose to these challenges by effectively managing cost, mitigating risk and continuing to enhance its products and services. All  business lines recorded growth in revenue and profit except for Hotels and Serviced Apartments.\"  Property Rental Business The Property Rental Business recorded healthy returns during the Reporting Period. Despite sluggish growth in mainland visitor arrivals and a weakening retail spending, rental reversion rates remained positive, recording an increase of 8% to HK420 million in revenue. The Mall Repositioning Program is progressing well and is expected to significantly reinvigorate the visual landscape of Kimberley Road and Nathan Road into a Ginza-style shopping district, drawing an enriched profile of retailers and shoppers to Miramar Shopping Centre and Mira Mall. Miramar Tower continued to enjoy high occupancy rate with quality and stable tenants. Rental reversion rates were stable.  Hotels and Serviced Apartments Business Hong Kong's hotel industry experienced its toughest year in a decade.  The Group's two hotels, The Mira Hong Kong and Mira Moon, responded to these market challenges with resilience. They further sharpened sales and pricing strategies and continued to make inroads into MICE, leisure travel sectors and corporate clients. Online hotel marketing and channels were enhanced to attract free individual travellers (FIT) and direct bookings to our own website. New propositions and packages were offered to diners in our hotels; and events and banqueting offerings were carefully designed exclusively with flair to meet both corporate and individual preferences. Food and Beverage Business The Group's Food and Beverage business continued to perform well, having turned profitable last year. Revenue grew by a healthy 32 %. Two new School Food outlets were opened in high-traffic malls during the Reporting Period, increasing the brand's total presence to six. The revamp of our Chinese flagship restaurant Cuisine Cuisine at ifc mall was well received by our customers and recorded growth in revenue. Our Banquet business continued to grow at outlets such as Tsui Hang Village, French Window Brasserie and Bar and Assaggio Trattoria Italiana.  Travel Business The strong US Dollar and a general increase in the overall consumption power of Hong Kong and Mainland China citizens have translated to increase in outbound travels. During the Reporting Period, the business experienced increased demand from Hong Kong and Mainland China for overseas vacations and luxury cruise holidays. Japan, Australia and Europe are favoured destinations. As a result, the business recorded a growth of 56 % over the Last Corresponding Period.  Business Outlook Mr. Lee concluded, \"Whilst the business environment is highly competitive and the global economy is expected to remain uncertain, the Group will seek and seize market opportunities by adhering to prudent business development strategy. The Group will also optimize each of our core businesses by deploying prudent and flexible operational strategies. Barring unforeseeable circumstances, we expect the overall business will maintain steady growth during the second half of the financial year, except that the Hotels and Serviced Apartments Business will continue to be under adverse circumstance with occupancy and average room rates under pressure.\" Company Logohttp://release.media-outreach.com/i/Download/2697  \n\nAbout Miramar Hotel and Investment Company, Limited \nAbout Miramar Hotel and Investment Company, LimitedEstablished in Hong Kong in 1957, Miramar Hotel and Investment Company, Limited (Miramar Group) is a group with a diversified service-oriented business portfolio comprising stylish hotels and serviced apartments, property rental, food and beverage, and travel services in Hong Kong and Mainland China.
