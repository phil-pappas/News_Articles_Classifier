He does not own the building. \nThe street was closed shortly after 8:30 a.m. ET, during the morning rush hour, and Toronto Police said on twitter that the street closure was due to an “unstable antenna.” \nA woman who answered the phone at the hotel said the general manager and director of sales were in a meeting and not immediately available for comment. \nStreets below the hotel and condominium tower have been closed several times over the past three years due to falling or unstable glass. The building is located at the corner of Bay and Adelaide streets, in the heart of the financial district. \nIn 2012, Donald Trump Jr shrugged off an incident of falling glass from the tower, saying “If you know anything about construction, that kind of thing just happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:12:58.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
