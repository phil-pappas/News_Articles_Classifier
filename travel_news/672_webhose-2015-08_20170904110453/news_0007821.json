Some 4,000 pounds of narcotics were lost in the process.\nThe seizure, which took place on July 18, was the “largest recorded semi-submersible interdiction in Coast Guard history,” according to the agency.\nThe 40-foot (12-meter) vessel was deemed “unrecoverable” after it sank.\nThe Coast Guard said there have been 25 known interdictions of semi-submersible vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean since November 2006.\n“Every interception of these semi-submersibles disrupts transnational organized crime networks and helps increase security and stability in the Western Hemisphere,” Vice Admiral Charles W. Ray, commander of the Pacific area, said in a statement.\nSemi-submersible ships are designed for drug trafficking, and because they are mostly submerged — often with only a cockpit and exhaust pipe visible above water — they are particularly difficult to detect and interdict, the Coast Guard said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:07:12.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
