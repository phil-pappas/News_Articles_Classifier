In this popular holiday month, a total of 3,247,357 passengers traveled with airberlin. The decrease in the number of passengers, i.e. 3.2 percent as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year, can be ascribed to a capacity reduction. Passengers traveled 4.871 billion kilometers (RPK) on airberlin's global flight route network, which corresponds to a decrease of 3.7 percent, in line with the ongoing flight route network optimization. The available seat kilometers (ASK) declined by 6.1 percent, to 5.580 billion. \nAt 87.3 percent, the seat load factor (RPK/ASK) for July developed in a highly positive manner, and increased by 2.1 percent. Furthermore, airberlin's capacity utilization rate for the period from January up to and including July 2015 increased by 0.7 percentage points in yearly comparison to a total of 83.4 percent. For the same period, the number of passengers declined by 3.9 percent, to 17,282,976 passengers. \nAs Stefan Pichler, CEO of the airberlin group, stated: \"The increase of the overall capacity utilization in the holiday month of July is giving us a push for the coming months, and we are doing all we can to continue with this positive trend. Due to the consistent continuation of our flight route network optimization and the capacity reduction connected thereto, an increase of the overall capacity utilization in combination with a reduction in the number of passengers provides an important indicator for increased efficiency in the course of our business redesign\". \nJuly 2015 \nNumber of passengers 3,247,357 (-3.2 %) \nASK in millions 5,580 (-6.1 %) \nRPK in millions 4,871 (-3.7 %) \nCapacity utilization rate in % 87.3 (+2.1 pp) \naccumulated, 2015 Number of passengers 17,282,976 (-3.9 %) \nASK in millions 32,274 (-3.9 %) \nRPK in millions 26,908 (-3.1 %) \nCapacity utilization rate in % 83.4 (+0.7 pp)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:12:21.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
