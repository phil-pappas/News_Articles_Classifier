I have watched the business grow from one lodge to 12 and feel so much pride in thinking of all the opportunities I have had to contribute to what it is today. I am excited that Ruben will join us as the CEO and bring a unique perspective to our leading family entertainment brand. I look forward to being involved in the next phase of Great Wolf’s growth.”\nRegarding his new role, Mr. Rodriguez said, “I am impressed by the great brand and compelling business model that Great Wolf has built under Kim’s leadership. As the leader in indoor water park resorts, Great Wolf has excelled in creating special and memorable experiences at each Lodge. I am eager to work with the management team to continue building and growing the Great Wolf brand, and to delight thousands of guests each year.”\nWilliam D. Rahm, a Senior Managing Director with Great Wolf’s majority owner, Centerbridge Partners, L.P., said “I am delighted with Ruben’s appointment as CEO. Ruben is an outstanding leader and brings a track record of delivering exceptional value to consumers. Ruben’s varied experiences, including most recently at Carnival Cruise Line, will be tremendously valuable as Great Wolf Resorts enters the next phase of its growth strategy and expands its footprint to new markets.
