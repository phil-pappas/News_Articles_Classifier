The hanger will be home to several rare vintage jets from around the world where visitors can get an up close view and learn more about the aircraft and the roles they played in history. \nAccording WHAM board member and jet-owner/pilot Tom Proctor, \"We are thrilled to have this new space to expand the mission of WHAM at Oakland Country International Airport. These rare jets are truly spectacular and we hope to be able to continue to expand our fleet as well as encourage aviation interest in today's youth.\" \nThe mission of World Heritage Air Museum is to rescue military jet aircraft from the 50s, 60s, and 70s, return them to flight status, and use them to encourage the youth of America to dream, wonder, and soar. The current collection of jets originated from around the world including Britain, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Spain, France, Russia and Poland. \n\"OCIA welcomes WHAM to the airport and we look forward to watching this worthy charity grow in Oakland County,\" said J. David VanderVeen, Oakland County Director of Central Services. \"To see these types of military jet aircraft in one place will be a great experience for visitors and pilots alike.\" \nWHAM was founded in 2011 at Detroit City Airport. That space will continue to serve as the maintenance and restoration location while the Oakland County facility in Waterford will be the flight operation base and group tour location. \n\"We are passionate about planes and role they played in world history,\" said WHAM Founder and Board Member Martin Tibbitts. \"There is a steady decline in aviation careers in our country and we hope our museum can help the youth of today feel the passion and excitement we feel about flying. We are fortunate to be able to restore and fly these jets as part of our mission.\" \nWHAM has several levels of sponsorships and ways to donate including jet sponsorships, pilot sponsorships, plane donations, corporate sponsorships and general contributions to aid in the running of the not-for-profit 501(c)3 organization. \nWHAM is currently scheduling tours for 2015-16 and hosting a private dedication ceremony on August 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:54:25.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
