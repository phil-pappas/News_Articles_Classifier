No access before any Emirates-operated flights, other Oneworld flights or before a Qantas-operated flight when booked on the Emirates EK flight number.\nAlso keep in mind that while your Emirates boarding pass will show an invitation to the lounge nearest your departure gate (such as in Concourses B and C), you can still visit the newer – and frankly, much nicer – Concourse A lounges if you've arrived early for your flight or have a longer transit.\nFor example, we were booked on EK434 to Brisbane from Concourse B, but followed the signs to Concourse A after clearing security and passport control to make use of Emirates' flagship first class lounge, and returned to Concourse B in ample time to board.\nDining Much as in the Qantas First Lounges that Emirates passengers can use in Australia, the Gulf airline offers its own a la carte dining facilities in Dubai, complete with full table service.\nOur morning visit saw the breakfast menu available...\n... which began with a delicious berry fruit smoothie, warmed croissants and espresso coffee:\nAs first class passengers can do in the air, you can order dishes here 'as is' or can customise them to your liking.\nToday was no exception, where we ordered a fresh omelette with our preferred fillings, the 'Marmite soldiers' from a different dish and then a side of chicken sausages with a cherry tomato on top:\nEverything was tasty and cooked perfectly, and while there certainly 'fancier' options on the menu, sometimes you just feel like something 'homely' when you're on the road, which this lounge delivered.\nFor guests who are merely peckish or have limited time, a number of 'grab and go' items are also available including salad rolls, meats and yoghurts...\n... joined by an impressive selection of spirits...\n... and also wines, with the signature drop being Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial (A$55/bottle from Qantas epiQure ):\nWhile it's not the Dom Pérignon you'll get on taking your seat in first class, non-vintage Champagnes are the norm for first class lounges – particularly those shared with frequent flyers travelling in economy.\nWork For work that just can't wait, make use of the dedicated business centre – offering computer terminals for those travelling without their own tech...\n... plus a number of meeting rooms...\n... providing for both privacy and productivity:\nFor something more casual, you'll find group seats scattered throughout the lounge and with power outlets near the lamps...\n... or if you forgot to pack your charger, use Emirates' own charging station and securely lock your phone or tablet away while it's being refuelled:\nThere's also free WiFi throughout the lounge, which delivered download speeds averaging 1.5mbps during our visit. That's more than adequate for basic tasks such as email and web browsing but without being 'lightning fast'.\nRelax Aside from the serenity of having no boarding calls to constantly interrupt your train of thought, the lounge also squeezes in a Timeless Spa day spa, with a selection of free 25-minute treatments for first class passengers and Platinum frequent flyers.\nAmong them, a de-stress back massage and a 'reflex therapy' leg and foot treatment... The Timeless Spa features both kneeling chairs and traditional massage tables...\n... or indulge in a manicure, a hair trim and shape or a professional blow dry in the beauty salon.\nThere are also separate 'quiet rooms' within the lounge, which you can use to nap when you've got the time...\n... or to just read the day's news or a good book in peace:\nWe're told that Emirates doesn't formally offer a 'wake up' service in time for your flight, but that passengers are requested to keep their boarding passes visible for staff to check when passing by as a just-in-case.\nFurther, there's a walled-in cigar bar for travellers so inclined...\n... and a separate – and very colourful – room for young children:\nWith everything you could reasonably ask for as a first class passenger, and then some, Emirates' terminal-sized Concourse A lounge in Dubai easily deserves all five stars.\nAlso read: Emirates Airbus A380 first class 'shower spa' review Emirates: first class private bedroom for Airbus A380, Boeing 777 Review: Emirates Airbus A380 inflight cocktail bar and lounge A380 first class suites: Qantas, Emirates, Etihad, SQ compared Emirates Airbus A380 business class review: Sydney-Dubai Photos: inside the 'Emirates Executive' Airbus A319 private jet Review: The Emirates Lounge, Brisbane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:08:15.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
