It grew in size over the years and raised money for charities.\nIn 2013, Guinness World Records certified nearly 10,000 zombies were the world's largest gathering of the undead.\nOrganizer Jason Meehan broke the news on Facebook on Thursday. He wrote that costs have risen and the decayed buildings that once served as the event's backdrop in the city have been replaced by new condos and restaurants.\nMeehan is tentatively planning an Oct. 3 \"funeral\" on the Asbury boardwalk.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:14:29.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
