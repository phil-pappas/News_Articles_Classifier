Although the purpose of my trips were more business than leisure I found time to stroll around the city that 10 years ago was partially destroyed by a massive hurricane. My camera captured better than my words how the city is and feels today. Here are some shots of the Crescent City that we all love to visit. \nThe day starts with a long line at the historic Cafe du Monde. Locals go very early in the morning -- I was told -- to avoid those lines and so I did as well \nEmployees at the Cafe du Monde are taking a break \nEnjoying a cafe au lait with beignets at the Cafe du Monde \nAt the trendy Magazine street that extends from the Garden District to the Warehouse District areas there are several boutiques and cafes that both locals and travelers visit. Here locals relax at the Stein's Market and Deli \nOn the streetcar back to the French Quarter \nVisiting the French Market is an experience as it is one of the oldest public markets in the country \nThe famous muffuletta at the Central Grocery and Deli \nLittle boys are running (and dancing) happily on the street \nLater in the evening, musicians share their music in public on the streets of French Quarter \nAnd I am having the French 75 at Arnaud's with some of the guests \nLife seems to be fine in New Orleans. As a local told me \"it is fine but not the same.\" The sunset says it all though. \nFollow Thei Zervaki on Twitter: www.twitter.com/thefullybooked More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:53:47.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
