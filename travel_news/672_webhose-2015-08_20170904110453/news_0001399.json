Natalie Paris, who visited the resort recently, said: \"After a couple of tight bends, the river became lackadaisical and a gentle paddle was all it took to scoot past men fishing, children shouting and waving, and the odd buffalo glaring from out of the water.\" The island of Sumba is just an hour's flight from Bali but is an unspoilt paradise with a fascinating tribal culture that is only just starting to be properly explored.
