Our apartment building was constructed in the 14th century, and the curved building across the narrow piazza from us was built on the ruins of a Roman forum. Near our apartment was the Basilica of Santa Croce, a beautiful 800-year-old church that not only contained amazing medieval and Renaissance art, but is the final resting place of Michelangelo, Galileo and other historical figures.\nChurches throughout Italy house artworks commissioned by wealthy families during the Renaissance; crowds of tourists pass daily without ever seeing the beauty within. We visited 15 churches in Florence and attended Mass in many, including a Gregorian chant mass at San Miniato al Monte with few people in attendance.\nWe traveled to Milan on the high-speed train, which is more convenient and comfortable than flying, to tour the massive Duomo; the first indoor mall, called Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, which dates to 1877; La Scala; and Di Vinci’s painting of “The Last Supper.” The Duomo took 600 years to build, contains more than 3,000 statues and was designed to hold 40,000 people.\nOTHER ADVENTURES: Zimbabwe safari | 'Snow monkeys' in Japan\nOn another day trip we visited the Cinque Terre, the necklace of five cliffside villages on the Ligurian Sea. These villages have become accessible by vehicle only in the last 30 to 40 years. When crowds in Firenze grew, we found a quieter spot by traveling to Lucca, which has the best preserved wall fortification of any city in Italy. Lucca isn’t always quiet — its annual music festival takes place in July and August. This year’s performers included Elton John and Snoop Dogg.\nOur travels were enlightening and fun, but our heart remained in Florence. We enjoyed sampling fresh cheeses and salumi, and tried new foods daily. Our favorite restaurants knew our preferences, and welcomed us with a prime streetside table most evenings. After dinner, we joined everyone else on “passeggiata” and strolled through the piazzas, enjoying wonderful street musicians and usually stopping for gelato.\nLike the residents, we shopped for fruit, cheese and bread daily at small markets nearby, and walked miles each day to enjoy the splendors of Florence, its history and friendly residents.\nThe writers live in Scottsdale.\nTELL US WHERE YOU’VE BEEN: To contribute to Your Travels, send a large, high-resolution JPEG attachment photo and a description or essay of up to 400 words to traveleditor@arizonarepublic.com.
