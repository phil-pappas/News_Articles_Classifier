While the delivery of Cincinnati’s streetcar vehicles has been delayed, progress on trackwork around the city has continued as operating crews begin preparations for testing the system. The operations and maintenance team from Transdev is now working on site. General manager John Claflin , maintenance manager Scott Archibald and transportation/safety and security manager Phil Lind met with the rail activation committee last week and walked through the completed Over-the-Rhine loop with the construction team as work continued in the Central Business District. To see photos of the streetcar’s progress, click on the image above. While streetcar vehicles that were expected to arrive Sept. 17 likely won’t be delivered until as late as December, project managers don’t believe it will postpone the streetcar’s September 2016 opening date. It’s unclear how much, if any, additional costs will be incurred as a result, and more information is expected to come by the end of the week. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported on Monday that the city had sent a “sternly worded letter” to CAF USA , the streetcar’s manufacturer, last week and hasn’t received a response. The city has threatened legal action if the manufacturer doesn’t live up to its nearly $21 million contract, and Elmira, N.Y.-based CAF USA is expected to pay a $1,000 fine for every day the delivery of the first streetcar vehicle is delayed. The Cincinnati streetcar is a $133 million project with 18 stops along a 3.6-mile route. \nWant Cincinnati Manufacturing news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
