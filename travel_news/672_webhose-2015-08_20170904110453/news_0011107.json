The government mobilized vast numbers of civilians and material resources, spending large amounts to build air force bases across southern and southwestern China, including Chengdu in Sichuan province, Kunming in Yunnan province, and Liuzhou and Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Sichuan’s civilians incurred heavy losses and casualties in building the airfields, because they were created through manpower with simple and crude tools such as stone-rollers, shoulder poles and tow ropes. Many workers were crushed to death when grinding the airfield runway. They served as the strategic air force base for Allied forces on the Chinese mainland From summer 1944 to August 15, 1945, there were 33 military airfields in the southwestern province of Sichuan, one of the main battlefields in China, including four for bomber aircraft and five for fighter jets circling the Chengdu Plain. They served as the strategic air force base for Allied forces on the Chinese mainland. Towards the end of the Second World War, the US Air Force mobilized 52,000 fighter bombers and most planes took off from the manpower-built airfields, conducting successful strategic bombing, and targeting several Japanese cities.
