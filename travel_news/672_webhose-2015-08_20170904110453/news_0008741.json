The Irish sites included in the listing include: The Unesco world heritage site of Bru na Bóinne, Co. Meath (number 224) The Cliffs of Moher, Co Clare (number 378) The university campus of Trinity College (number 468) The Rock of Cashel in Co Tipperary (number 497) Speaking about the listing, Head of Communications, Alex Connolly emphasised – \n“The Irish sights which made it onto the list reflect the range of attractions Ireland has to offer and demonstrate that for a small country, Ireland is certainly punching above its weight internationally. \n“The Lonely Planet is one of the premier sources of information for people all across the world when researching a holiday and lists like these quite literally put Ireland on the map and in the mind’s eye of thousands of potential visitors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T17:01:49.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
