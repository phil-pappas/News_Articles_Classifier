San Antonio’s City Council voted 6-5 on Thursday to approve a new operating agreement with Lyft , paving the way for the ride-sharing company to return to the market roughly four-and-a-half months after departing in protest over what its leaders contend were onerous municipal regulations. The new agreement includes a provision allowing Lyft drivers to voluntarily submit to city background checks. Drivers who submit to such checks will then have an opportunity to notify prospective riders through the Lyft platform that they have done so. The Lyft agreement also allows the city to conduct random driver inspections. Some critics believe the voluntary background checks are redundant and send the wrong signal to more progressive companies looking to bring their technologies to San Antonio. City Councilman Ron Nirenberg has some concerns about the agreement. However, he voted in favor of the deal to get Lyft to return. “Sometimes public policy moves by three yards and a cloud of dust,” Nirenberg said. “We still have lots of work to do to ensure that our laws reflect a San Antonio that is ready for an evolving transportation landscape. Lyft is one first step, but it is one I’m glad we have finally made.” Roughly 70 people spoke at in the council chambers on Thursday about the Lyft agreement, according to one City Hall source who said most of those who addressed council members were affiliated with the taxi industry. The list of groups that lined up against the Lyft agreement includes the Taxicab, Limousine & Paratransit Association, which has funded a national advertising campaign called “Who’s Driving You?” The group has questioned the safety of ride-sharing companies. Councilman Joe Krier said the affirmative vote \"gives consumers choice and lets them choose if they want a driver with an additional background check.\" It's not clear what the vote means for Uber, which exited San Antonio in early April. The ride-sharing company also left over concerns about the city's ride-sharing regulations. Nirenberg, who is hopeful San Antonio can work out a deal to get Uber back, as well, said council members should revisit Chapter 33 of the City Code, which regulates all private vehicles-for-hire. \nWant San Antonio Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:08:40.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
