It destroyed 48 of the attraction’s 52 buildings, melted the incline to the bottom of the canyon, and closed down the popular Colorado tourist destination.\nSome might have called it quits.\nBut not Harry Hargrave, president, nor Mike Bandera, general manager.\n“It took a lot of hard work, but it’s back,” Bandera says.\nThe bridge was first built at the unlikeliest of times, in 1929, during the start of the Great Depression. Although the 2013 fire was the most destructive event in its history, the renewed park is fully open for business.\n“I think it’s better than ever,” Bandera says.\nThe bridge, an engineering marvel perched 1,200 feet above the Arkansas River, escaped the worst of the blaze. About 100 boards were charred, but the infrastructure remained sound.\nNearly everything else had to be rebuilt.\nTwo years and $3 million later, a spanking new visitors center greets guests and offers a 220-seat restaurant with an observation deck where you can sit, relax, enjoy a drink and admire the scenery.\nThe Mini-Train is back, along with a rebuilt Plaza Theater and a children’s playground complete with a carousel and a water pad, with jets of water soaking kids who want to get wet. All are included in the park’s admission.\nOn the south side of the bridge is a new barbecue restaurant. There’s also a new trolley that shuttles folks across the bridge if they’re too timid to walk. (Hint: It’s not that scary unless you’re really afraid of heights.)\nFor an extra fee, try the Royal Gorge Cloudscraper zip line or ride one of six shiny red gondolas carrying passengers back and forth across the chasm. Also for the brave is the Royal Gorge Skycoaster, where passengers get flung out over the vertigo-inducing drop on something that feels like a slingshot.\nNext year, the park likely will add a 6,000-seat amphitheater for concerts and other outdoor events. In December, look for the bridge to be lit up like a Christmas tree.\n“I think we’ve taken the facility to five-star status,” Bandera says. “Everything is state-of-the-art.”\nIn the theater, visitors can see and hear the story of the attraction, including footage that records the fire’s impact.\nThe park is the No. 1 attraction in Southern Colorado, Bandera says, with an average of more than 300,000 visitors a year.\nAt the rededication ceremony in May, Beth Fisher, granddaughter of George Cole, the bridge’s designer and builder, recalled that after the fire, scouring the ashes, they found the original dedication plaque for the bridge.\n“It had a rainbow burned into it,” she says. “I think that was a sign.”\nLinda DuVal is a Colorado freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:04:04.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
