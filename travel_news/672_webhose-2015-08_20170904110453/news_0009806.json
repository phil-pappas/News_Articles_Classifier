It is a brand by itself with its chalk white houses, blue waters and excellent weather. And Swissotel Resort Bodrum Beach is one of the investments in Bodrum that adds value to its brand. The newest item in the Swissotel Hotels & Resorts portfolio, the hotel opened its doors in June at Turgutreis, where is said to be the \"Saint-Tropez of Turkey\" by the New York Times. The hotel was designed by Gökhan Avcıoğlu from a well-known Turkish design studio, GAD international, with 66 spacious standard and suite rooms as well as 72 residences and villas offered for private service. The interior designer was Irmak Çağlar from Çağdaş Design Works. In particular, the lobby area is incredibly spacious, full of energy and modern. You can feel the dignity of white and the easiness of pastel colors in the whole hotel. I loved the harmony of wood and metal used in the design of room entrance doors. The asymmetrical fridge cabinets where minibars are located carry lines of modern architecture and are integrated into the hotel. Each and every room is a work of modern art. The walls are a mix of leather and metal paneling. Giant pieces of onyx marble used in bathrooms indicate that you are in a summer hotel. The textured, asymmetrical, massif and grey flooring reminds you of the sea. The Canadian Pürovel brand is preferred for products in the rooms. Swissotel Resort Bodrum Beach offers a sea experience that is very special. While it is not possible to find a wide beach area in many hotels in Bodrum, a crystal clear beach awaits you here. Having both a beach and a pier, the hotel also has a pleasant restaurant ashore. The restaurant serves sunbeds on the beach as well. In addition, the Swiss Cafe around the pool and the Yuri Restaurant on the terrace of the main building are some other qualified meal alternatives. The sushi and seafood are a must for dinner at Yuri, and you should enjoy the unique sea view there as well. The crew of the hotel deserves five stars for the pace, quality of service and geniality. I congratulate the general manager of the hotel, Emre Kocamustafaoğulları, for his crew. Work hard, play hard People that spend the whole year working hard dream of having a rest and having fun in Bodrum. In this case, they should stop by the beach clubs. Kuum Beach, with its qualified customers, sea, DJs and food has recently become one of the places I love the most in Bodrum. The place, which is in Türkbükü, is a beach club, a fish restaurant and a hotel at the same time. One should definitely stay in the rooms in Kuum Hotel. You can see the quality of the hotel, which is dominated by a simple design, the moment you enter its lobby. There is a luscious view and a simple serenity. Famous DJ Hakan Kabil, who performs here, and shows by professional percussionist Erkut Sezer are for party animals. What a show! Real entertainment. The place is not like other beach clubs where sunbeds are cheek by jowl. There are leather beds instead of hard deckchairs that are similar to soft beds for sleeping. As for lodges, they are another luxury. With its ambience and sea, Kuum Beach is a relaxing place as much as it is fun. It is as qualified as to be called elegant. Believe me, the cream and brown suits of the service crew, their white hats and smiling faces will make you happy in these suffocating days of summer. I congratulate the manager, Ersin Süzer, for integrating summer entertainment with summer rest. The best sunset view If you ask me, the best place to watch a sunset in Bodrum is the Limon Cafe in Gümüşlük. In service for 10 years, the restaurant is a place that is far from advertising itself; it only awaits those who know it well. At Limon Cafe, there is real household furniture in a large garden. There are canapes, large tables, couches and wooden chairs on the grass. Old-style lamps hang above your head, flowerpots surround you, there are carpets on the ground, and bookcases and many interesting decorative items distinguish the place. The fried octopus with butter is the most famous item on the menu. It is served on a large pan that is still on fire with plenty of butter in it. Their fried mantı is excellent as well. Before visiting, you should make reservations in Limon Cafe. 3 most popular restaurants this week 1) Limon / Bodrum 2) Kasa Roof Lounge / Karaköy 3) Mixo Terrace / Beyoğlu 3 most popular ethnic restaurants of this week 1) Hitode / Gümüşsuyu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T11:56:25.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
