National police chief Somyot Pumpanmuang downplayed any suggestion that the suspect was connected to terrorism. \nOfficers say the suspect, who was charged with illegal possession of weapons, was involved in the attack. \nHowever, they say he is not the man seen on CCTV footage leaving a bag at the Erawan Shrine before the explosion. The bomb tore through the crowded shrine on 17 August, injuring more than 100, mostly tourists. \nThe man, who was described as a 28-year-old foreigner by police, was arrested in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok on Saturday. Thai army chief General Udomdej Sitabutr said the man had so far not co-operated with investigators. \nNews reports indicated the suspect was a Turkish citizen, since stolen Turkish passports were found at his apartment along with bomb-making materials including ball bearings and piping, similar to what was used in the shrine attack. \nThe Turkish embassy issued a statement denying the arrested was connected to Turkey or had Turkish citizenship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T13:46:34.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
