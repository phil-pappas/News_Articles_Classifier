The results range from the impressively practical to the downright unusual, but most importantly they all show abundant imagination, and they are all unique. Not only do they give inspiration on what new cars to make, but also they remind Toyota of the kind of responsible global citizen it should be: whether it be helping little girls learn to read in Romania or conserving the environment in Paraguay .\n(Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osmcQntcLas )\nThe response to this year's contest was overwhelming: Toyota received a record total of over 875,000 artworks from 81 countries and regions. National contests were held until March 2015 , with selected entries progressing to the World Contest in May 2015 . World Contest entries were judged by Toyota President Akio Toyoda and a panel of outside experts in art and automotive science, and winners were invited to Japan for the ninth award ceremony in August.\nThis year, gold awards were given to children from Sri Lanka , Romania and Paraguay across three age categories. In addition, the newly created Engineering Inspiration Award (selected by Executive Vice President Mitsuhisa Kato) and a special award selected exclusively by President Toyoda were presented to exclusive winners.\nFor more detailed documents, visuals and videos, please visit our press site:\nhttp://www.image.net/dream_car_art_contest_2015\nRelated websites:\n- Toyota Dream Car Art Contest official site:\nhttp://www.toyota-global.com/events/dream_car_art_contest/\n- Campaign website: www.dreamcar-of-the-day.com\n- Facebook: https://facebook.com/ToyotaDreamCarGlobal\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/ToyotaDreamCar\n- Instagram: https://instagram.com/toyotadreamcar/\n releases/toyota-holds-ninth-dream-car-art-contest-award-ceremony-300133441.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://facebook.com/ToyotaDreamCarGlobal", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/toyota-holds-ninth-dream-car-art-contest-award-ceremony-300133441.html", "http://www.toyota-global.com/events/dream_car_art_contest/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osmcQntcLas", "https://instagram.com/toyotadreamcar/", "http://www.dreamcar-of-the-day.com/", "http://www.image.net/dream_car_art_contest_2015", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=HK87105&Transmission_Id=201508260605PR_NEWS_USPR_____HK87105&DateId=20150826", "https://twitter.com/ToyotaDreamCar"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:48:40.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
