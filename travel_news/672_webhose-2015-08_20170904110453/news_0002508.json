(Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) Yes, Mike Pouncey took — and is taking — grief over his emotional news conference in April. Pouncey had sobbed partly out of joy that the organization still has such faith in him, partly because he had been such a knucklehead (his word) early in his career.\nPouncey now recognizes his missteps and is determined to avoid them. But he also revealed he didn’t have a choice.\n“It was a collective agreement that I was either going to get better or be gone,” he said.\nAllen Eyestone Dolphins center Mike Pouncey (above), on twin brother Maurkice of the Steelers: ‘I feel like I’m chasing my brother my whole career, he’s been so outstanding.’ (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) The Dolphins just signed Pouncey, a first-round pick out of Florida in 2011, to a five-year, $52.2 million contract, so he’s not going anywhere. Teams don’t routinely cast aside centers who make two Pro Bowl appearances their first four seasons.\nPouncey, now 26, realized that off-field decisions, such as tweets that embarrassed the organization and any role he played in the bullying incident, were unbecoming of a leader. Today?\n“My look on it is I’ve got to be the leader that I always knew I could be,” Pouncey said. “I want to lead these guys to where we want to go. That’s the playoffs. I want to come out, show these guys, lead by example every day, how to work as a professional athlete.”\nAllen Eyestone Miami Dolphins guard Mike Pouncey (51) goes one on one with Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Earl Mitchell (90) at Dolphins training camp in Davie, Florida on July 31, 2015. (Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) An immature player typically gets a big contract, splurges and one day wakes up wondering where it all went.\n“Save it, man,” Pouncey said. “Save it. I was fortunate enough to be a first-round pick. I got all the gifts out of the way early in my career, so now, it’s just about saving it and making sure I’m secure in my life.”\nRather than focus on expensive toys, Pouncey is more concerned with being the best center in the NFL named Pouncey. His twin, Maurkice, has made four Pro Bowls and is a two-time All-Pro.\n“I feel like I’m chasing my brother my whole career, he’s been so outstanding,” Mike said.\nHe doesn’t feel weary from the chase. More like motivated.\n“He’s a guy that makes me better every day,” Mike said. “When I come out to practice, I think about how he practices every day and so it pushes me to be better. And I know when we both look at the end of our careers, we’ll be happy with them.”\nMaurkice was delighted that Mike provided him ammunition to razz him in that news conference.\n“Soon as I got done with the press conference, he killed me,” Mike said.\nTeammates?\n“I hear from them every day,” Mike said. “They’re just giving me a hard time, calling me a crybaby. But I say, ‘Look, man, when they give you that kind of money, I can’t wait to see your press conference.’ ”\nKnowing there’s a time for banter and a time to get serious is part of leadership. Coach Joe Philbin said he’s seeing Pouncey lead already in camp.\n“He’s got really good energy on the practice field and when he does something, even tonight when we do walk-throughs, it’s hard to slow him down,” Philbin said.\nHalf speed doesn’t work if the guy you’re lining up against is Ndamukong Suh. Is it more grueling going against him?\n“One hundred percent,” Pouncey said. “When you’re going against a player like that, a guy that’s going to come out and give you his all each and every play, every day, it’s going to make you better.”\nBetter and breathless.\n“I’m so exhausted at the end of the play, I can’t even talk trash like I want to.”\nThe Dolphins believe they have the right pieces on offense, from the new receiving corps to quarterback Ryan Tannehill to running back Lamar Miller. The unknown: the line.\n“On any team, your front seven on defense and your offensive line are going to take you where you want to be,” Pouncey said. “So it’s going to be on our shoulders this year, how our offense plays. If we keep Tannehill upright, you’ll see a lot of plays out of him this year.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/02/42/9b/073115-spt-dolphins-camp7.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/02/a1/4f/073115-spt-dolphins-camp27.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/02/da/19/073115-spt-dolphins-camp9.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-03T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:52:06.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
