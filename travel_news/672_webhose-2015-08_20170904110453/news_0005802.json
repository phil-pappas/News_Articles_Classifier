Jurors in the Colorado theater shooting case reached a decision Friday, Aug. 7, 2015, on whether Holmes should be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty. The same jurors rejected Holmes' insanity defense and convicted him of murder.(RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post via AP, Pool, File) They deliberated for about six and a half hours over two days before reaching a decision Friday. It will be announced at 5 p.m.\nThe same jurors rejected Holmes' insanity defense and convicted him of murdering 12 people and trying to kill 70 others three years ago at a suburban Denver movie theater.\nDuring the sentencing phase, the defense told jurors that the shooting was caused by the psychotic breakdown of a mentally ill young man. The nine women and three men also listened to the stories of the children, spouses and parents of the 12 people killed and how their lives were changed forever by the attack.\nJurors would have to unanimously agree for Holmes to be sentenced to death.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nJurors in the Colorado theater shooting trial will review a graphic crime scene video before deciding whether to give James Holmes the death penalty.\nThe panel of nine women and three men asked for the 45-minute recording Friday morning.\nDefense attorneys objected that the gruesome images taken immediately after the massacre would be prejudicial. But Judge Carlos Samour, Jr. allowed it and said jurors would only have 50 minutes to watch the tape. He warned them not to let it prejudice their deliberations.\nJurors must decide whether Holmes should be executed for killing 12 during the 2012 assault, which also injured 70.\n___\n9:15 a.m.\nJurors have resumed deliberating whether Colorado theater shooter James Holmes should be sentenced to death or life in prison.\nThe panel of nine women and three men deliberated for about an hour Thursday before going home without reaching a decision. They continued Friday.\nDistrict Attorney George Brauchler told them death was the only appropriate sentence for Holmes, who was convicted of murdering 12 people and trying to kill 70 more during a crowded midnight movie premiere in July 2012.\nBut defense attorney Tamara Brady urged them to have mercy on Holmes, saying his schizophrenia and psychotic delusions drove him to kill.\nDeath sentences must be unanimous in Colorado. If even one juror disagrees with capital punishment for Holmes, he would be sentenced to life in prison without parole.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/07/6a/bd/1a99b10284f5473a808f24d6b604c8b2-ca4fdb1f9805463b95b7afbf96df4f75-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-07T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:19:18.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
