McCullough, of Hastings, Minn., was scheduled to deliver twin girls at the Colorado Fetal Care Center at Children's Hospital Colorado by C-section on Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015. Hospital officials said Wednesday they had no update on the surgery. (KUSA-TV Photo via AP) \"I just can't lose both,\" she said. \"There's a chance of saving one.\"\nThe twins, Hannah and Olivia, share an abdomen, liver and intestinal tract. The girls have separate hearts and kidneys.\nMcCullough told the television station Olivia is not expected to survive because of her heart. She only has a single ventricle and is missing valves.\nDoctors said it could take up to 12 hours to separate the twins.\nConjoined twins happen once every 200,000 live births, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center, which says between 40 to 60 percent arrive stillborn.\nMcCullough said she wants to see both her daughters after their birth, even if it's for a short time.\n\"I will get to see my girls very briefly after the delivery,\" McCullough said. \"They will need to be intubated right away, but the doctors will hold them up real quick and I'll get a peek.\"\nMcCullough said she spent eight years in the U.S. Army, then went to law school and is now an attorney. She has a 6-year-old son named Tristan from a previous relationship that ended in divorce. She said her son is moving to Denver to be with her soon.\nShe became pregnant with her girls during another relationship, and it wasn't until her second trimester when she learned she was carrying conjoined twins. The relationship with the girls' dad ended shortly thereafter.\nMcCullough has lived at the Ronald McDonald House in Aurora since early August. Her stepmother is there, keeping her company and caring for her.\nBefore she moved to Denver, McCullough's friends organized a \"prayer shower\" and they gave her keepsakes that honor the girls' lives.\n\"If I had my way, I'd keep them together if they both could live,\" McCullough told KUSA-TV. \"But it's not possible. I wish it were. If they stay together, they'll both pass.\"\n___\nInformation from: KUSA-TV, http://www.9news.com", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/27/52/11/1cb5c5527b60429eb58a4e1e124a11df-ab29b0d34ce74ea2906894b0ee169be9-0.jpg", "http://tinyurl.com/ov7k3za"], "published": "2015-08-27T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T12:13:09.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
