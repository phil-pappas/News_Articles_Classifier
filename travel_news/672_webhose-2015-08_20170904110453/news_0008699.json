The suicide rate at the facility is more than eight times the national rate for female inmates and more than five times the rate for the entire California prison system.\nSuch deaths in custody have drawn scrutiny since Sandra Bland was found hanging in a Texas jail cell after a traffic stop that gained national attention amid increased focus on police practices, though she died in a county jail and not a state prison.\nThis Oct. 22, 2012 photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Stephanie Feliz. Feliz, 34, was serving a sentence of more than 11 years for crimes including theft, forgery and burglary, when she died March 6, 2015 in California Institution for Women in San Bernardino County. Feliz, whose death was ruled a suicide, is one of four women to kill themselves at this facility in the last 18 months.( California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via AP) In California, the Institution for Women is the only women's prison in the state to have had any suicides in the last five years, and another 20 of the prison's 2,000 inmates have attempted suicide during the last year and a half.\nIt is a shocking turnaround at a facility that last year was cited as a rare example of California providing proper mental health treatment for inmates. All four women who died were receiving mental health treatment in the days before their deaths.\nThe prison's psychiatric program was promoted as a positive example in May 2014 by Matthew Lopes, a federal court-appointed overseer who monitors mental health treatment for inmates. Of six inpatient programs for mentally ill inmates statewide, he found that only the one at the women's institution was providing proper care.\nThis Oct. 22, 2012 photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Margarita Murguia.

Murguia whose death was ruled a suicide, is one of four women to kill themselves at this facility in the last 18 months.(California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via AP) But this January, court-appointed suicide expert Lindsay Hayes labeled the prison \"a problematic institution that exhibited numerous poor practices in the area of suicide prevention.\" They included inadequate suicide risk evaluations and treatment and not checking on inmates as often as required by department regulations.\nThat was before Gui Fei Zhang, 73, killed herself a day after being released from suicide watch in February, according to the advocacy group California Coalition for Women Prisoners. Stephanie Feliz, 34, hanged herself less than a month later after several previous attempts and after seeking emergency mental health care the same day she died, the group said, citing letters from her fellow inmates.\n\"(W)e have women dropping like flies, and not one person has been questioned as to why we believe they are killing themselves,\" inmate April Harris, who has been in prison since 1998, wrote to the coalition after Feliz's death. \"I have never seen anything like this. Ever.\"\nThis Oct. 22, 2012 photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Alicia Thompson. Thompson, 31, was serving an 11 year sentence for burglary with a second-strike enhancement for possessing drugs in prison, when she died Feb. 24, 2014 in California Institution for Women in San Bernardino County.

There were so many variables in each individual's case that it didn't point to anything specific that CDCR was doing wrong,\" she said. However, the department increased mental health training for prison employees, with extra supervision for some who had \"performance issues,\" she said.\nThe prison system's inspector general recently began sending inspectors to the women's prison day or night whenever there is a suicide or attempted suicide, the only one of the state's 34 prisons with that level of scrutiny. The decision was made so \"our set of eyes can try to pinpoint what's going on ... since it seems to be spiking there,\" spokesman Shaun Spillane said.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/08/01/60/9a/d86c1087075146a0ba832137ff89aaf9-078a2c0f541f4d27ba03e3c086ce1abf-1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/08/01/24/e9/d86c1087075146a0ba832137ff89aaf9-078a2c0f541f4d27ba03e3c086ce1abf-3.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/01/a3/e6/d86c1087075146a0ba832137ff89aaf9-078a2c0f541f4d27ba03e3c086ce1abf-2.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/08/01/79/d5/d86c1087075146a0ba832137ff89aaf9-078a2c0f541f4d27ba03e3c086ce1abf-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-01T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T19:50:11.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
