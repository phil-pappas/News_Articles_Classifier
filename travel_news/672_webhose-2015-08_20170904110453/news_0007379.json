The man then walked through the security area and headed to an elevator, where he encountered another employee, O'Neil said. The man then shot himself in the head. \nAccording to PIX11, the 53-year-old private security officer was in cardiac arrest at the scene and was taken to the hospital where he later died. \nPolice said the motive for the shooting remained unclear. \nThe federal office building on Varick Street houses an immigration court, passport processing center and a regional office for the Department of Labor. The guard had a weapon but it doesn't appear he was able to fire, according to police. \nO'Neil, speaking at a news conference at the scene, said it appeared the shooter acted alone. He said nothing gave police any reason to believe the shooting was terrorist-related. \nEmployees at the building said they were told to get down on the ground when the shots rang out. A short time later, the building was placed on lockdown and then evacuated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:38:01.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
