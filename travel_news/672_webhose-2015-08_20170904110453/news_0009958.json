With pre-orders expected to open on Friday 11th September , and handsets to go on sale in a number of territories the week after , I'm expecting the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus to outperform the original 6 and 6 Plus handsets in the retail market, in customer satisfaction, and to accelerate the adoption of iOS 9.I'm also expecting much of September to be filled with a lot of internet hate over the latest 'S' handsets from Apple, with many ready to exploit any tiny mis-step from Cupertino to put down what is likely to be the world's most popular phone to date.[caption id=\"attachment_18745\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] SAN FRANCISCO, CA â€“ MARCH 9: Apple CEO Tim Cook exits the stage (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images)[/caption] A leaky supply chain has given many industry watchers the chance to extrapolate the specifications of the iPhone 6S platform. The latest additions to the knowledge-base is a 12-megapixel camera with 4K video recording. This joins a step up in RAM from the 1GB of the iPhone 6 to 2GB on the newer models, the new A9 chip, and potentially boosting the base model storage to 32 GB.Yet all of these numbers are dwarfed not just by the latest flagship Android handsets, but also by many of the mid-range handsets as well. The iPhone 6S may be new, but the argument will go that it's under-delivering by skimping on specifications to increase profit and force people to upgrade every year.Then there is the operating system. Although iOS 9 has been available in beta, the new handsets are expected to include ForceTouch - the ability to press harder on the screen to bring up an alternative menu or UI element. Stand by for many posts along the lines of Apple obviously knowing iOS weak (compared to Android) and having to add gimmicks to the platform to force you to buy the new handset as developers are forced to update all their apps just to keep a prominent place in the iTunes App Store.[gallery2012]Naturally, the Internet will point out that this risky gamble over ForceTouch will kill iOS and everything good about it, so why encourage Apple? After all, there's nothing new in the iPhone 6S, it's just an iteration of a handset that was released last year with a few minor changes. Because of that everyone is going to throw their money at Apple... and only The Knights of the Internet are smart enough to ride into Social Media City to stop you falling for this long con.Let's calm down and think about this. Of course it's about the money for Apple. It's about the money for any manufacturer, because that's what business is about. Making things that people want and selling to them. When you look at the iPhone 6S family, it's clear that it will be a smartphone that many people will want.One of the smartest tricks that Apple has done is create two product timelines. There's the family that includes the iPhone 4, the iPhone 5, and the iPhone 6. That updates every two years. When you reach the end of your contract, there's a new Apple handset just about to go on sale. The offset is perfect, but with the mobile industry loving the increased subsidy and reduced churn of twenty-four month contracts, Apple could have had an issue with those in the middle of the contract.Which is where the 'S' timeline comes in. Unlike the San Francisco Giants, Cupertino has a team that can deliver in odd-numbered years. Offset by twelve months to the original iPhone timeline, these years have the iPhone 4S, the 5S, and now the 6S. The goal with the iPhone 6S is not to sell to the iPhone 6 user, but the iPhone 5S user. To that group, the new handset is not an incremental update, it is everything that is new and improved, ready and waiting for them at the end of their contract.[caption id=\"attachment_19301\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Someone has to come out on top (image: Ewan Spence)[/caption]Every mobile operating system has to evolve otherwise iOS would still be lacking cut and paste, Android would only work with handsets using a physical qwerty keyboard, and Symbian would continue to rule the mobile world. The surprising thing for me would be if Apple did not include ForceTouch in the latest release of iOS. It's already present in OSX on the new MacBooks, and it's a huge component of WatchOS and the Apple Watch. While Apple is not going for a complete 'one OS to rule them all' in the mould of Windows 10, there is a consistency across the islands of the ecosystem.And it's unlikely that ForceTouch will run any key parts of the OS. iOS 9 still has to run on older devices that don't have the new hardware in the digitizer.As for the specification top trumps numbers game, it's not what you've got, but how you use it. A top of the range Android handset with 1GB of RAM is not the world's greatest experience, but it wasn't a killer weakness of the iPhone 6 (although at some points it did make operations awkward, notably when switching between tabs in Safari). Apple is balancing all-out power against flexibility and usability, and Cupertino has always biased towards a better user experience than providing a hot-rod engine that barely lasts the quarter-mile.The Internet will be lighting up the rant-o-tron to inform Apple why everything about the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is wrong. And with a narrow range of black and white facts using smart presentation, the Internet will be right.Yet the consumers who will be buying these new smartphones in their millions will be right as well. The Internet can hate on success all it likes, but the new iPhone is going to be a success, and there's nothing harsh language can do to stop it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T13:12:03.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
