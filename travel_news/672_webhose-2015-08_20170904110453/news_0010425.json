About 34,000 passengers ride on summer Saturdays.\nThe agency chose not to take on labor costs to assemble longer trains for just one day, since no huge public events were scheduled, said spokeswoman Kimberly Reason.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencikâ€™s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time Seattle Times staff", "external_links": ["http://www.soundtransit.org/sites/default/files/20150806_rpt_june2015_serviceperformance.pdf", "http://m.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail?tab=Saturdays"], "published": "2015-08-28T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:43:18.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
