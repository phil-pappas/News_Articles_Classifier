Photographer's Note \nI love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terror The wide brown land for me! - My Country by Dorothea Mackellar I took this photo on one of the loneliest stretches of road I've ever seen. There is no name for this place, and I'd driven for hours without seeing a single car, or town, but stopped here for a rest. In total I drove 4,000 kilometres on my Western Australian road trip. The solitude and silence really gets you thinking. After you lose your voice doing solo karaoke. PS: Really not happy with what TE is doing to the sharpness and colour rendering of photos. This image looks fine on my monitor, but when I upload, it's a dog's breakfast \nsnunney has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:42:21.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
