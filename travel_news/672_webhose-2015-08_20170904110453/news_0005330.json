According to the current progress, it would commence operation at the end of this year. The development includes a five-storey Midfield Concourse with 20 parking stands, and an extended automated people mover system that connects to Terminal 1. Upon opening of the Midfield Concourse, HKIA will be able to serve an additional 10 million passengers every year and increase the ratio of passengers served by frontal stands.\nMr So said, “The Midfield Concourse can help meet HKIA’s increasing aviation demand in medium term. However, as the current two-runway system will meet its practical maximum capacity in one or two years, the airport urgently needs a Three-runway System to cater for its long-term need of passenger and cargo growth, as well as maintain Hong Kong’s status as an international and regional aviation hub.”\nSource:-Hong Kong International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:46:19.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
