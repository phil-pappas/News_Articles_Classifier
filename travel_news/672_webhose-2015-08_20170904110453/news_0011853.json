We are committed to improving safety at level crossings wherever possible and we will work with the local authority and crossing users to improve safety at this crossing as soon as possible.”\nNetwork Rail is working with both the parish and county council and will communicate with local people as soon as possible to discuss the crossing and provide updates about its future.\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:40:54.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
