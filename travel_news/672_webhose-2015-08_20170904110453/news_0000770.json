Not the least of those is Auckland, New Zealand’s biggest city and urban area which spreads across 48 volcanic cones – many of these ancient volcanic hotspots are now tranquil parks and picnic spots.\nRangitoto Island is Auckland’s iconic natural landmark and, with its distinctive symmetrical cone and proximity to the city, it’s no wonder that a trip to Rangitoto is one of the city’s most popular activities.\nExplore by foot or, for the complete experience, hop on the Fullers Volcanic Explorer tour, for a scenic ferry ride across the harbour and a guided tour on a 4WD tractor train to the top. Walk through the pohutukawa forest, see lava caves and panoramic city and harbour views from the summit at 260m above sea level.\nRangitoto is Auckland’s most recently formed volcano, dating back about 600 years. Amazingly, although the island’s lava field contains no soil in the usual sense of the word, 200-plus species of native trees and flowering plants, 40 fern and several orchid species grow on the island. An artificial causeway connects Rangitoto island to the island sanctuary of Motutapu which was one of the earliest places inhabited by Māori in the Auckland region.\nTravel Tips\nRangitoto Island is in the Auckland’s Waitemata Harbour and is easily accessed by ferry from downtown Auckland. If you want to do it under your own power, rent a kayak from Mission Bay.\nAt 196 metres, Mt Eden – or Maungawhau in the original Māori – is the highest volcano on the Auckland isthmus but also one of the most accessible because of its central location overlooking Auckland’s busy downtown.Formed some 20 – 30,000 years ago, Mt Eden has three main craters in a row, creating an oval-shaped bowl of lush green pasture.\nYou can enjoy a guided walk with members of the Ngati Whatua tribe – guardians of the mountain. The Tamaki Hikoi explores the mountain, unlocking the history of a place that is of deep cultural significance to them.\nThe Heaven To Earth walk begins near the dormant crater which was once the site of a majestic pā or Māori village. The remains of occupation terraces, storage pits and housing sites are a glimpse into early Māori settlement as the guides bring Auckland’s unique landscape alive through storytelling, song and customs.\nSource:-Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:11:09.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
