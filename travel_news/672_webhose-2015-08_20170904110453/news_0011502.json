There is still plenty of time to enjoy the summer weather in Michigan, but Pure Michigan is encouraging travelers to start thinking about cooler temperatures and vibrant colors with the launch of the 2015 fall advertising campaign that began Monday. “The fall travel season in Michigan provides travelers with breathtaking scenery, as well as unique activities not available other times of the year – such as cider mills and fall color tours,” said David Lorenz, vice president of Travel Michigan, part of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. “By growing awareness of Michigan’s fall travel opportunities, we can extend the travel season and help bring additional traffic to local businesses supporting our state’s tourism industry.” The campaign, which includes regional and in-state television and radio spots, features 17 partners and will air through October 1. This year’s ads again feature the television spots Open Road, Nature of Trees, Deep Breath, Harvest Time and Tee Times and the radio spots Nature’s Greatest Show, Catch Up, Games on the Grass and Here’s to the Curious. Advertising spots will run in regional markets including Chicago, Ill.; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo, Ohio; Indianapolis, Fort Wayne and South Bend, Ind.; Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wis.; St. Louis, Mo.; and Southern Ontario. Pure Michigan billboards will also be up with new, fall images in many of these markets. Locations featured on this year’s fall billboards include Laughing Whitefish Falls, Carp River Valley and the Pere Marquette River. Fall bus wraps in Chicago feature the Au Sable River, the Keweenaw Peninsula and Copper Harbor. The 2015 Pure Michigan Official Fall Travel Guide is also now available to order on michigan.org and as a free, universally accessible digital edition, which will allow users to access the guide from their desktop and laptop computers, smartphones and tablets. This year’s cover photo is of Bond Falls in southern Ontonagon County. The guide is free and features travel tips and destination features – such as Deer Camp, Autumn on the Straits and Creative Drives – alongside vibrant photography, a fall events calendar and state parks and camping information. In tandem with the launch of the advertising campaign and fall guides, michigan.org and Pure Michigan social channels including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and the Pure Michigan blog are now featuring fall imagery as well. The total fall advertising budget of $2.39 million includes $935,778 in funding committed by this year’s private sector partners through the Travel Michigan Ad Partnership Program. In total, in 2015 there has been more than $5.7 million in partner funding committed to the Pure Michigan advertising campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T21:11:57.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
