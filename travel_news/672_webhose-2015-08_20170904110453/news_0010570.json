Trains are my favorite form of travel. I read, edit photos and daydream. Plus, there is more leg room than a plane or car. On a trip this summer, though, I got a glimpse of my own country, on my way from San Francisco to Seattle to visit my friend Trevor, who I met in Burma.\nTrevor is part of what I call the \"Anna Network,\" a group of amazing friends I've collected from the far corners of the world. I can pretty much go anywhere and have a friend to meet for dinner or a place to sleep. Trevor moved back to Washington recently after years of living in Singapore, Japan and England. (And he's not even 30!) We drove out to eastern Washington to a friend's lake house on the Columbia River to ride jet skis, eat ribs for dinner and watch movies late into the night. It was a perfect weekend.\nLiving it: After that Washington weekend, I moved on to Vancouver, where I took on a 20-mile brewery biking tour. My legs were burning, but I refused to stop pedaling. Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge finally appeared between the trees. Despite my lack of city biking skills, I was determined to conquer the bridge and the rest of the tour unscathed.\nAdvertisement The more I travel, the more my adventures revolve around outdoor spaces, local food and good beer. Vancouver has a huge outdoor culture. Plus, it's a runner's dream! I ran 8 miles my first night in town along the False Creek seawall and quickly fell in love with the city. Every day was spent running, biking or hiking. And once again I had help from the Anna Network.\nLast summer in Spain, I was stuffing my suitcase in a hostel luggage room when I met my friend Brittany, who lives in Vancouver. Fast-forward a year, and I am borrowing her bike to ride around one of the world's best parks, Stanley Park . The 1,000-acre park is filled with trails and a 5.2-mile seawall lined with a bike path. I took a picnic lunch and updated my travel journal on a bench over looking the water. Vancouver clearly knows the secret to my heart — great weather and seaside running trails.\nDreaming it: The e-mail arrived when I was deep in the Amazon jungle, unplugged from the world: A big university wanted to know if I was interested in teaching photojournalism courses in the fall. When I saw the e-mail four days later, I informed them that I was, indeed, interested and set up a guest lecture for the week following my Vancouver trip. Do I keep traveling the world, or move back to Texas for a semester or two?\nAnna Mazurek has been traveling the world and working (as an English teacher, photographer, bartender — whatever keeps her moving) as she goes since 2008.
