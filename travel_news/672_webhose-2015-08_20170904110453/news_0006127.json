The two brands are working together to inspire families to get out and experience everything that the outdoors has to offer.\nWith activities including an opportunity to create your own short story recalling the fabulous summer adventures you’ve had and a guide to how to build your own hide-out, it’s an irresistible call out to families everywhere to get more active and involved in creating wonderful and adventurous memories.\nThe Famous Five has been one of Enid Blyton’s best-loved collections since its release in 1942. Almost three quarters of a million copies of the 70th anniversary editions of The Famous Five books have been sold since 2012. In May 2015 Hodder Children’s Books released new covers for the next five books by some of the most highly respected and well known children’s illustrators – Five On Kirrin Island Again (Shirley Hughes), Five Go Off To Camp (David Tazzyman), Five Get Into Trouble (Polly Dunbar), Five Fall Into Adventure (Babette Cole) and Five On A Hike Together (Tony Ross).\nGenerations of children and parents have joined the friends on their many adventures – from spending the weekend hiking in the countryside to solving the mystery of kidnapped Timmy!\nThe Summer of Adventure campaign was inspired by a recent survey, commissioned to mark the release of the new covers for The Famous Five books, which found that playing on devices and watching films are proving far more popular for children than playing outside (83% vs. 63%). Children spend less time creating their own adventures, using their imagination and spending time outdoors in the fresh air compared to their parents’ generation.\nFrom the outset, Center Parcs was very eager to get involved in the campaign and agreed that family adventures need to be profiled more prominently – not least because they have a deep understanding of the fact that families who learn together and play together are much more productive.\nCenter Parcs welcomes more than 400,000 families each year to their Villages and works diligently to evolve new activities and concepts that meet with current family demands and desires.\nSue Goddard, Group Leisure Manager at Center Parcs, said:\n“It’s fantastic to be a part of the Enid Blyton Estate’s Summer of Adventure campaign. Nostalgic activities such as climbing, forest crafts, den building and woodland games are still as popular as they have always been and we have been introducing more and more to our offering. Our guests love them! The wholesome things families can do together are still very popular today and long may that last!”\nAnne McNeil, Publishing Director of Hodder Children’s Books, said:\n“This exciting partnership is a real call to action to involve children in activities from den-building to story-writing. It links creative play, reading and learning in a unique way. Enid Blyton, herself, would have thoroughly approved. What could be a better way to celebrate the reissue of five classic adventure titles than to link with Center Parcs in this innovative way? Let the fun begin!”\nSource: Center Parcs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:38:07.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
