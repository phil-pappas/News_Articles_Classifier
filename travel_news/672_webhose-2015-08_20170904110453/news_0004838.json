A search revealed 13.85 pounds (6.28kg) of cocaine in pouches hidden in the cast. \nDrugs prosecutors accused the defendant of smuggling and possessing cocaine for promotional purposes. \nWhen the defendant showed up before the Dubai Court of First Instance he admitted that he smuggled and possessed the cocaine but not for promotion. \nA.M. confessed before the presiding judge that he smuggled the cocaine against a tiny quantity from the seized drugs which he admitted he wanted to use for his personal consumption. \nThe Swedish refuted the intention to promote the cocaine in Dubai. \nThe policeman claimed to prosecutors that he suspected the voyager from the minute he saw him sweating heavily and looking frightened and confused. \n“Shortly after he passed through the metal detecting device, I asked him to step aside to have him searched. When I hand-searched his legs, they felt bulgy. When I asked him, he told me that his two legs were broken and in a cast. He claimed that he had the proper medical reports in his bags and said that he would get them from the luggage. While he was heading to the luggage conveyor belt, he started running suddenly. I ran behind him quickly and stopped him. We accompanied him to a private search room … there it was discovered that he had hidden the cocaine in five plastic pouches and wrapped them in the cast. There were four pieces of cast around his legs except for around the knee area to allow him to walk freely. Surprisingly, the suspect took out $100 and told me to ‘take it’. We took him to the airport’s clinic where his medical check up confirmed that his legs were not broken,” testified the policeman. \nAn anti-narcotics police lieutenant testified to prosecutors that A.M. confessed that he had agreed to smuggle the drugs for €2,000 (Dh8,050) for another Swedish man named Dragan. \nA ruling will be heard soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:36:42.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
