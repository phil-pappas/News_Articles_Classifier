Only Mexico sends more international visitors each year to San Antonio than Canada, and now Alamo City officials want to position this market as a preferred global destination for more Canadian travelers. The city, through its San Antonio Convention & Visitors Bureau , is seeking proposals from companies in Canada interested in marketing the destination to potential visitors in that country. A new contract with the selected company is expected to begin on Nov. 1. “Outside of Mexico, Canada represents our strongest market for incoming international travel,” said San Antonio CVB Executive Director Casandra Matej . “Thanks to more than 300 days of sunshine a year, more than 50 top-notch golf courses and a growing culinary and cultural scene, San Antonio is drawing growing interest from Canada.” Toronto-based Pulse Communications & Travel Marketing Inc. secured a contract with San Antonio in January and hopes to retain its relationship with the Alamo City. “San Antonio is a compelling destination,” Pulse Communications President Sana Keller told me. “Canadians are big fans of the city.” Proposals from interested companies are due to the city by Sept. 16. City officials anticipate that the new contract will be for three years with an option for a two-year extension. \nWant San Antonio Media & Marketing news in your inbox?
