Maybe because it’s little known. But Gatwick becomes the latest airport to launch a luggage delivery service that allows flyers to travel unencumbered by heavy suitcases on their commute to and from the airport.\nIn partnership with AirPortr, flyers traveling in and out of Gatwick Airport in London now have the option of trusting their suitcases with the luggage transfer service and traveling bag-free.\nFor departing flyers, the service is touted as a time saver and stress reliever, as they no longer have to factor in the extra time it takes to cross airport terminals dragging heavy suitcases behind them.\nFor arriving passengers, the service means that travelers can bypass the hotel and head straight into town while their bags are dropped off at their lodging.\nIn both cases, it means travelers can hop on the bus and the London Tube stress and bruise-free, without having to negotiate stairs and cobblestone streets.\nBilled as an ‘affordable luxury,’ the service to and from Central London to the airport costs £30 ($47 USD) for two bags, regardless of weight and size.\nOther airports and airlines to offer a similar service include the Hong Kong International Airport, American Airlines and United.\nUnlike third-party transfer companies, however, AA and United allow flyers to bypass the baggage carrousel altogether upon arrival and proceed directly to their destination. Bags arrive at the hotel within four to six hours.\nAirPortr is also available at London City Airport.\n© Provided by AFPRelaxNews Gatwick has launched a luggage transfer delivery service.
