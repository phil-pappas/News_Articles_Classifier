What's more fun than jumping in the car and taking the family on a last-minute road trip? Rand McNally , the leader in maps, navigation, and travel content, can help you maximize your final days of summer wherever you decide to go. The waning days of summer provide a great chance to spend quality time with loved ones, and make lasting memories. In fact, a recent survey supported in part by the U.S. Travel Association, noted that vacations have the potential to be life changing for the whole family. So in the spirit of family togetherness, here are 10 ideas for that last-minute, family fun, road-trip adventure: Have a picnic in a national park. Drive to the closest water park. Open up the Rand McNally Road Atlas to your state and pick an interesting town to visit. Draw a 100-mile radius around your house and create a mini-road rally, visiting back roads and stopping in small towns. Choose a weekend fest. Show your children around your college campus. Find a state park and take a family hike - maybe geocaching along the way. Pick a museum you've never been to before - and create a scavenger hunt for artwork or artifacts to make it fun. Pick a historical landmark or presidential library to visit. Go to a farm to pick fresh produce.
