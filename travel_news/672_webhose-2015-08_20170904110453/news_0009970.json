A leader who endlessly procrastinates, avoids making decisions or keeps on changing their mind will quickly drive employees mad - and just as importantly, lose their respect. As soon as you have enough information to make a sensible, informed decision, do it and move on to the next one. You should also be consistent. Leaders who are inconsistent in their actions are a complete nightmare to work for because everyone ends up getting stressed trying to second-guess what they are going to do – and invariably getting it wrong. Act in a fair, logical and open way, and you will quickly gain the respect of those around you. Own up to your mistakes, too. If you have made an error, be the first to tell your team. By doing this you will establish a culture where people understand it is ok to fail, rather than always playing it safe and never achieving anything. Don’t delegate anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Lead from the front and muck in Indeed, make sure you allow employees to think for themselves and find their own way of doing things. Set the task, but then let them get on with it however they feel is best, even if it might not have been the route that you would have taken. Praise effort and reward achievement, too. Show them their efforts are not going unnoticed, otherwise they will wonder why they are bothering. But don’t try to be best friends with your employees. Tempting as it is to try and make everyone love you, you are not there to be liked, you are there to do a good job and grow the business. And sometimes you are going to have to make tough decisions that not everyone will like. Be kind and courteous, but also keep some distance – as a general rule do not socialise with your team out of work, and do not encourage them to share their personal problems with you except where this directly affects their work. Remember you are not there to be their friend, you are there to be their boss. And if the business fails, you will be neither. Caitlin Blake-Lane is the director of strategy at family law firm Vardags. She says the secret to being a good leader is this: “Be true to your style. Most people can name great leaders, but don’t think you have to adopt their manner of speaking, their stance and their wardrobe to be equally effective. Everyone has a unique leadership style which can be fine-tuned, but at its essence, is still you. “The key to learning from leaders you admire is in distilling the qualities that make you perceive them as such and incorporating them into your own style, not adopting their entire persona.” She adds: “Don’t delegate anything you wouldn’t do yourself. Lead from the front and muck in when the time calls for it, especially in small business where there is no room for a ‘not in my job description’ attitude. \"Changing the toner in the photocopier, crunching the numbers, giving the workspace a quick once over: occasionally helping with these tasks proves to your team that their job is important in the running of the business, and motivates them to adopt the same attitude to helping out. “Act with integrity, treat others with respect, and be accountable. Set the bar high for yourself in whatever your role, and others will follow your lead.” • Back up your leadership skills with a fleet that delivers.
