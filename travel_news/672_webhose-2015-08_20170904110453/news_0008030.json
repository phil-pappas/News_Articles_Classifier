Rick Scott’s office.\nThe governor announced that 54.1 million tourists visited the state during the first two quarters of 2015, a 5.8 percent increase during the same time period last year.\nBetween April to June, 25.8 million tourists visited the state, up 5.5 percent over the same period in 2014, Scott’s office said.\nThe number of travel-related jobs is also at a record high. During the second quarter of 2015, more than 1.2 million state residents were employed in the tourism industry, up 4.9 percent over the same quarter last year.\n“We are excited to mark the first half of 2015 with our biggest second quarter ever, and we look forward to exceeding our goal of 100 million visitors to Florida this year,” Scott said.\nMeanwhile, hotel bookings in Palm Beach County remained strong this summer. The countywide hotel occupancy rate hit 67.2 percent in June, up 3.6 percent over the previous year, county tourism leaders said.\nIn June, there were 483,210 nightly bookings available at rooms in the county’s hotels and motels, according to the Palm Beach County Tourist Development Council. Nearly 325,000 of those nightly bookings were sold to out-of-town visitors and other guests.\nThe bookings marked a 6.6 percent increase over June 2014, according to the council. The county’s hotel room inventory grew by 2.8 percent in June compared to June 2014.\nThe mounting demand is driving up hotel room rates.\nThe average cost of a nightly hotel stay was $121.49, up 4.9 percent from June 2014.\nAn important benchmark for hoteliers — revenue per available room, which gives an average of what visitors pay based on actual occupancy — increased by 8.7 percent in June compared with June of 2014, the tourism council said.\nJune tourism tax collections also continue to climb.\nThe county collected $2.5 million in tourism taxes in June, up 31.5 percent over June 2014.\nThe bed tax is levied on all hotel stays and vacation rentals of six months or less. The revenue pays for tourism ads, beach renourishment and facilities such as Roger Dean Stadium.\nIn February, the county raised its bed tax by a penny to 6 cents per dollar. But even without the extra penny, county tourism leaders say bed tax collections would have jumped by 9.6 percent.\n</span", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T14:15:57.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
