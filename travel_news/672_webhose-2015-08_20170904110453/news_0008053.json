Here are eight tips that will make your Easter Island trip a little more affordable. Book Your Flights Early \nThe only really practical way of getting to Easter Island is to fly, and while the general wisdom on flying is to monitor the prices, the broad trend is that booking early is much more effective than waiting for the last minute. Flights booked several months in advance with a fixed schedule can be available for $600 or under, while those booked at short notice will often set you back up to $1400. Consider Camping Or Staying In A Hostel \nWhile flights are your biggest expense, accommodation is always the next item on that list, and if you are looking to trim your costs, camping is a great option with pitches available from around $10 per night, as opposed to the budget hotels that begin at $80-$90 per night. If you are looking for somewhere that at least offers a bed, the local hostels offer dorm beds from around $30 per night. Fast Food On Easter Island \nPeople traveling to most parts of the world will want to try the local cuisine, but with a reasonable meal in one of the local restaurants costing $30 or more, here on Easter island it can be a better idea to eat a little more simply. Hot dogs are available from several vendors and are quite tasty, while other Chilean fast food favorites such as empanadas, particularly with fish or seafood fillings are very popular. Rent A Car Instead Of Joining An Organized Tour \nThe organized day trips around the island will usually cost around $75 per person, but if you rent a car for three days the costs for two people are around the same, and the car will give you more freedom to explore. The additional benefit is that you can spend more time at each site than the schedule of the tours will provide, with the amazing Moai being the real reason that most people visit the island. Share Your Costs \nThe expenses of a trip to Easter Island can be significant, but there are many ways in which you can reduce your costs by looking for others traveling to the destination at the same time as you. Forums and social media can often put you in contact with others, and from sharing car rental costs to shopping together during your time on the island, this can help to trim your budget for the trip to Easter Island. When Flying Directly Travel Through Lima Not Santiago \nIf you are flying to Easter Island through the United States, there are two possible routes, one that goes through the Chilean capital Santiago and another that goes through the Peruvian capital Lima. Canadians, Australians and Mexicans traveling the route through Santiago will have to pay the reciprocity fee, but going through Lima helps people to avoid these charges. Consider Hiking Around The Island \nEaster Island is actually a rather small island and is largely accessible on foot, and if you are ready to spend time hiking back and forth to each site, you will find many of the Moai are accessible on foot. This will save a significant amount on car rental or tour fees, and will give you a perspective on the island that those who are taken around by bus certainly don't get to enjoy. Cook For Yourself Rather Than Eat Out \nWhile trying new cuisine is often one of the great joys of international travel, Easter Island depends on what can be imported from the mainland, so restaurants generally offer Chilean cuisine at a hefty premium because everything is flown on to the island. This is one destination where you can shop and cook your own meals, without losing out too significantly on any local delicacies.
