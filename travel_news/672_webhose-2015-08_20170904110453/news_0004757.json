Ever wanted to score a world first? Here’s your chance to dazzle and amaze your friends by setting a Guinness World Record. Be the best in your chosen field and we promise life will never be the same again. To set a Guinness World Record just follow these six simple steps. See? It’s as easy as lifting 12.5kg with your tongue ! 1. Choose your discipline Guinness World Records holds details of 40,000 records. So the competition is tough when it comes to setting a new one - but if you’re the creative type, a brand new title is yours for the taking. You are also welcome to have a bash at breaking an existing record. Fancy going for the world’s tallest mohican or the largest collection of Barbie dolls? These and more are up for grabs but, whatever you decide to go for, it helps if you stand a realistic chance of success. 2. Register your attempt Head to Guinness World Records to submit your record proposal. It’s completely free, although a charge is levied for fast-track applications. By registering your attempt, it will be formally recorded by Guinness World Records (GWR). That means it meets the organisation’s criteria and confirms the legitimacy of your claim to be a world-beater. It also ensures you are given a comprehensive evidence checklist, so you can prove your claim to a record and have it officially recognised by GWR. And if you want to go one step further and have a GWR judge observe your attempt, that’s possible for a small fee. 3. Practice, practice, practice To stand a chance of putting your name in the record books, you will need to be absolutely on top of your game. So whether you’re attempting to crush the largest number of apples in your biceps, build the world’s tallest playing-card tower or swim the furthest distance underwater, it pays to put in the hours practising. If you’re chosen pursuit is fitness-related, even better. Even if you don’t succeed all those hours of practice will get you into tip-top shape. 4. Get the experts in It stands to reason that you will have a fair degree of competence in your chosen record-breaking area. But it’s always worth consulting other experts to increase your chances of success. It is also a good idea to seek advice from seasoned record breakers. These people will draw on personal experience to help you handle your nerves on the big day and can ensure you meet the strict guidelines issued by GWR that mean your record will be officially recognised. By calling on their support you will maximise the likelihood of becoming a record holder. 5. Calm your nerves You may be the best chainsaw juggler or sword swallower in the world, but put the pressure of a record attempt on your shoulders and there is every chance you may have a wobble. So whatever you’re doing, find a way to keep calm beforehand. Perhaps you could try some breathing exercises or listen to your favourite music to get in the groove. 6. Go for it! With your ducks in a row and Guinness World Records on standby to mark your achievement, it’s time to put your plan into action. Get a group of family and friends to support you and give it your best shot, being careful to stick to the GWR guidelines to verify your attempt. And remember, there’s no shame in not achieving your ambition: it’s better to have tried and failed than never to have tried at all.
