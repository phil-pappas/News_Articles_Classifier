Copies of passports and other identifications should be saved in self-addressed emails or mobile phones, so they can be produced in case of an emergency or when visiting the UAE mission in the host country. \nHe called on the citizens to respect the general laws of the host country and to represent the UAE honourably abroad, while urging them to co-operate with the authorities upon arrival at the host country’s airport by disclosing some important personal information if asked, such as the duration of stay, accommodation, airfare and the date of return and the amount of cash they will have during their presence in the host country. \nIn the event of escorting non-citizens, normal procedures must be followed to issue a prior entry visa and a written undertaking from a sponsor to incur expenses of a housemaid. \nHe called on citizens to preserve the emergency numbers to communicate with the ministry or the state’s mission or contact with the number of countries, where there is no diplomatic representation of the UAE, to be used in the event of any emergency. \nAl Dhaheri wished the travelling citizens happy holidays and safe return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:57:57.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
