The fuzzy bodies aren’t easy to spot based on movement, because they’re only slightly speedier than sloths (which, in turn, are only slightly speedier than eucalyptus bark), so my search is for bulky shapes in the trees. \n“If you see what looks like a basketball jammed in a fork, give a shout,” the guide, Tim, says. \nThe stunning scenery of Kangaroo Island (KI), off Australia’s southern coast, can make the remote spot seem as if it were dropped into the ocean at the end of the Earth. Diverse habitats stretch across the Long Island-size KI, from untouched bushland to dense forest, and wetlands to sand dunes. It seems a million miles away from the mainland, but is in reality only a few minutes away by plane. \nWith one-third of the island preserved in conservation parks, national parks and wilderness protection areas, KI is regarded as the best place to see Australian wildlife in the wild. The island is home to kangaroos, tammar wallabies, fairy penguins, short-beaked echidnas (anteaters), New Zealand fur seals, glossy black cockatoos and much more than the few koalas in the trees above my head. From shore, visitors can spy migrating southern right whales and their calves out in the Southern Ocean. \nBut it’s not only about the wildlife. Kangaroo Island has a growing culinary scene that food lovers might expect in a larger, more urban setting. Of the 4,600 or so human residents, most are farmers, fishers and other primary producers (the industries that, in general, generate raw materials for other industries). The island’s pristine environment and isolation provide fertile ground for freshly caught King George whiting, sheep’s cheese, marron (crayfish), Ligurian honey, distilled spirits and small-batch varietal wines. \nThe rugged natural beauty makes Kangaroo Island the kind of place where there will always be mealtime entertainment — whether it’s the landscape or the animals that grab your attention. And with an abundance of both, the only reason you’ll need your smartphone is to take photos. \nLigurian bee sanctuary \nSmall jars, squeeze bottles and giant tubs of honey crowd the shelves at Island Beehive, one of the largest organic honey producers in Australia. But it’s the actual producers — the island’s Ligurian bees — that have a special distinction. \nKangaroo Island has been a sanctuary for Ligurian bees since 1885, shortly after the bees were shipped from Bologna, Italy, to protect their genetic identity. Due to the island’s isolation, all present-day honeybees on the island are descendants of the early Ligurian queens and believed to be the purest remaining stock of this strain of honeybee. To protect the bee population, an embargo has been placed on the entry of bees, honey, unprocessed honey products or used beekeeping equipment. \nMore than half of Kangaroo Island is native old-growth bushland, and there’s something flowering nearly every month of the year. Beehives are moved around the island to follow the flavors of the season, especially the many species of indigenous eucalyptus trees. \nI wander past tubs of honey for tasting, making sure I’ve narrowed down my choices to a couple flavors that I can take home. After a few dozen samples, I decide on Spring Flora (a medium-dark honey with a full-flavored taste) and Stringy Bark (which doesn’t have a sexy name, but makes a dark honey with a smoky flavor), but honestly, I could eat all of them and be happy. \nMy guide, Tim, is also a beekeeper and has about 200 hives all around Kangaroo Island. We stand next to a demonstration hive, which gives me an inside look at the “chefs” behind the honey jars I decide to take home. For them, the island is a rich resource for their gathering, and ultimately makes honey with a distinctive taste that visitors can’t get anywhere else. \nOutside, as I stand in the morning sun, a bee lands on my arm. Its body is dusted with pollen, and the bright sunshine makes it look a little like powder made of gold leaf. I walk slowly past a flowering shrub, and the bee zips away. Compared with the tasty pollen sources on Kangaroo Island, I’m too boring to keep a bee’s attention. \nCulinary capital \nIn the tasting room at Kangaroo Island Spirits, my first sample is a liqueur that links the island’s bees to the distillery. With freshly roasted walnuts and KI’s Ligurian honey, the rich dessert liqueur tastes like a liquid version of hot cross buns. \nThe island’s Cellar Door and Farm Gate trails allow visitors to navigate by taste, whether it’s local wine and spirits, or honey and cheese. I’m trying my best to sample the best of everything, even if I can’t possibly get to every single stop on the map during my stay. \nSouth Australia’s first boutique distillery, Kangaroo Island Spirits is known for its gin, vodka and liqueurs that incorporate native Australian botanicals and locally grown ingredients. The crisp, juniper pine spice taste of the distillery’s small-batch Wild Gin comes from Kangaroo Island native juniper and boobialla, a berry native to the island. Mixed with citrus, it’s what I imagine a summer day might taste like. The koalas can have their eucalyptus. I’ll take the juniper. \nAt Island Pure sheep dairy, I grab a taste of smooth, creamy yogurt made with Ligurian honey, and choose a package of haloumi cheese to enjoy later. The farm milks 300 to 400 ewes per day, but in between, the animals quietly graze in the shade of gum trees on the banks of Gum Creek. \nVines go back as far as 1837 on Kangaroo Island, but it was only in 2001 that KI was declared an official Australian wine region. I duck into the Bay of Shoals tasting room, which overlooks the Bay of Shoals and Reeves Point, the site of the first settlement in South Australia. \nThe jaunty pelicans on the label might make someone not take this wine seriously, but after a thorough tasting, I buy a bottle of Shiraz for my picnic lunch. \nAt the Andermel Marron farm, visitors wander through a holding shed where the farm’s freshwater crayfish are kept in tanks before being distributed to Kangaroo Island and mainland restaurants. The farm’s cafe features marron (and smaller “yabbies”), and although I’m not bringing any live samples to my picnic, I make a note to return here for dinner. \n‘Booze and roos’ \n“In the Dreamtime of the Aboriginals, Kangaroo Island was known as Karta,” says Tim, as we drive to Seal Bay. “It was believed that the spirit follows the path taken by Nguruderi (a creation being) after death, from Kangaroo Island to the spirit world in the Milky Way.” \nTo nearly 1,000 Australian sea lions, Kangaroo Island isn’t a passage to the afterlife — it’s just life. Seal Bay is home to the third-largest colony of Australian sea lions in the world, and once I complete my trek along the boardwalk to sit in the sand, I’m able to watch the colony go about its day. \nA beach full of sea lions is almost like a beach full of people (although the aroma factor is a little different): Pups play in the surf and call to parents, adults sunbathe and feed pups, males with something to prove pick fights. \nDespite having chosen my seat a distance from the sea lions to give them some privacy, two young pups have decided to check me out. They nose at my sandals; their moist breath and whiskers tickle my toes. \nUntil Mom calls, with a bark. Startled, the pups spin awkwardly and wiggle through the sand, belching hurried responses on their way back to her. \nA beach may be an optimal spot for a Kangaroo Island picnic lunch — especially since KI has about 335 miles of coastline — but Tim and I have something else in mind. He drives through deep green fields, past an echidna, and around the corner from a mob of kangaroos, we find the perfect spot. I unpack the haloumi, wine, salad, bread and King George whiting, while Tim fires up the barbecue. \nAs we eat, the KI kangaroos (a subspecies of the western gray kangaroo) inch closer. They stand and watch us for a short time, with younger roos seeming to be the most interested. Once their curiosity is satisfied, they sprawl under the shade of some nearby trees during the midday heat, scratching their bellies. \nTim hands me a plate of fish, salad and bruschetta topped with grilled haloumi, then holds up his glass of wine for a toast. \n“Here’s to booze and roos,” he toasts. \nOver in the shade, the gray kangaroos snooze away. More wine for us, then. \nJill K. Robinson is a freelance writer in Half Moon Bay.
