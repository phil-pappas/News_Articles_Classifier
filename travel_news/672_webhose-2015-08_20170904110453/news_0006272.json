however GEG today announced credible financial results for the first half, after the successful on time and on budget opening of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™. The expansion was only operational for 35 days within the reporting period and we continue to ramp up the performance and open additional facilities to further boost the appeal to the mass market.\nAs anticipated, customers' spending behavior across the market remains cautious, resulting in lower year-on-year revenues for the Group. As a result, earnings at GEG in the second quarter were partially impacted by lower revenues and the opening preparation costs of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™, including the additional staff costs in the lead up to the grand opening. Management has and will continue to focus on driving efficiencies, exercising rigorous cost controls and adapting our product offering to meet evolving market conditions.\nThe launch of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™ has been well received and the majority of the resort's amenities were launched on the opening date. A majority if not all of the remaining gaming, retail and F&B outlets are expected to be opened by year end. We continue to execute operationally and ramp up the property with a focus on the mass market.\nIn terms of the market, the fundamental drivers for long-term growth - such as increasing domestic consumption, a fast growing affluent middle class in China and planned major infrastructure improvements - remain unaltered, and should drive a new wave of visitors to Macau in the coming years. The strength of our existing offer, unique development pipeline and financial resources, position us well to capture this opportunity.\nWe are passionate about our Chinese heritage where we are focused on supporting Chinese brands and local Macanese SMEs as well as promoting the best of traditional and contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and arts. We are committed to supporting Macau to become the \"World Center of Tourism and Leisure\".\nOn 22 May, we paid a special dividend of $0.28 per share, and reflecting our continued confidence in the long term outlook for Macau and our commitment of returning capital to shareholders, we are pleased to announce another special dividend of $0.14 per share to be paid in October.\nI am also pleased to announce the strategic investment into SBM which owns and operates a number of world-class, iconic branded hotels and casinos in the Principality of Monaco . We very much look forward to working with them and building upon this strategic relationship.\nFinally, I would like to thank all of our team members at GEG for their hard work in enabling the Group to achieve these credible results, successfully launching Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™ and delivering our renowned 'World Class, Asian Heart' service to our guests.\"\nSuccessful Opening of the Mass Market focused Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and the Family Friendly Broadway Macau ™\nThe expanded mass market focused Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and the brand new family friendly Broadway Macau™ both opened simultaneously on time and on budget on 27 May 2015 , bringing GEG's total investment in Cotai to $43 billion .\nGalaxy Macau™\nIt is one of the world's largest destination resorts ever built, and consists of new signature features such as: the new Skytop Adventure Rapids which complements the largest skytop wave pool in the world; five world class hotels; the Promenade, which includes more than 160 outlets, from high-street brands and flagship stores to designer boutiques, first-to- Macau brands including Alexander Wang , Moncler and Qeelin; flagship stores for Burberry, H&M and T-Galleria Beauty by DFS and international luxury brands Bottega Veneta, Bvlgari, Lanvin, Louis Vuitton and many more; and finally; more than 80 food & beverage outlets, offering everything from authentic pan-Asian cuisine to world class dining experiences from Michelin starred chefs.\nBroadway Macau™\nIs a unique family friendly, street entertainment and food resort, consisting of: 3,000 seat Broadway Theatre; the vibrant Broadway street entertainment district celebrating the best of Macanese and Chinese culture; Broadway Hotel; 20 retail outlets and 40 mainly local SMEs food & beverage outlets.\nVisitors and residents of Macau alike have embraced both new properties, with daily visitor volumes surging significantly.\nMarket Overview\nAs expected, the macro challenges of 2014, in particular anti-corruption measures and softening macro-economic conditions in China , carried through into 2015. Total gaming revenue decreased by 37% year-on-year to $118.1 billion . Second quarter revenue of $55.2 billion was lower by the same percentage. Visitation of 14.8 million in the first half of 2015 declined slightly by 3% compared to the same period in 2014. Visitors from mainland China now represent 65% of total visitation.\nThe VIP segment was most impacted by macro conditions, with half-year revenue for Macau as a whole falling 42% to $67.2 billion (1H 2014: $116.2 billion ). It is still the largest segment of the market, accounting for 57% of total gaming revenue.\nThe evolution of the market to mass continued, as Macau diversified its offer by adding MICEE, recreational, dining, retail and entertainment options including Galaxy Macau TM Phase 2 and Broadway Macau TM in late May 2015 . Mass revenue in Macau as a whole declined by 29% to $45.2 billion in the first six months of the year but increased its share of the total market to 38% from 34%. Major planned infrastructure such as the Taipa Ferry Terminal, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, the extension of the railway network from Gongbei to Lotus Bridge and the Macau Light Rail Transit, will dramatically improve access to Macau and connectivity within Macau itself, driving visitors to the territory in the future. It is recognized that in the short term, Macau is experiencing some bottlenecks in infrastructure development and completion delays in certain projects.\nElectronic gaming revenue was $5.7 billion in the period (1H 2014: $7.3 billion ). This segment accounts for 5% of the total gaming revenue.\nSmoking Update\nWe are pleased that the Macau Government has indicated some flexibility and are open-minded to consider the retention of smoking lounges. The enabling legislation for the smoking ban is in the committee stage, and could be held up for another year. Allowing smoking lounges would be viewed as a positive for the market. The gaming concessionaires continue to work together for a pragmatic solution.\nGroup Financial Results\nFirst Half of 2015\nThe Group's results for the first half of 2015 include only 35 days of operation of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™ which opened on time and on budget on 27 May 2015. The Group posted revenue of $25.4 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 billion in the first half of 2015. As of 30 June 2015 , the latest twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was $10.0 billion . Net Profit Attributable to Shareholders was $2.0 billion including $1.0 billion of non-recurring charges such as $0.7 billion of pre-opening costs. Galaxy Macau™'s Adjusted EBITDA was $3.2 billion , a decrease of 41% year-on-year. StarWorld Macau's Adjusted EBITDA decreased 42% year-on-year to $1.1 billion . Broadway Macau™'s Adjusted EBITDA was $(2) million , which included $5 million of bad luck for its first 35 days of operation.\nDuring the first half of 2015, GEG experienced bad luck in gaming operations which reduced Adjusted EBITDA and NPAS by approximately $265 million , where the majority occurred at Galaxy Macau™.\nThe Group's total gaming revenue on a management basis [1] in the first half of 2015 decreased 36% year-on-year to $24.5 billion as total mass table revenue decreased 17% year-on-year to $8.2 billion and total VIP revenue dropped 43% year-on-year to $15.5 billion .\n[1] The primary difference between statutory revenue and management basis revenue is the treatment of City Clubs revenue where fee income is reported on a statutory basis and gaming revenue is reported on a management basis.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20150819/8521505390-a\nSecond Quarter of 2015\nThe Group posted revenue of $11.7 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Galaxy Macau™'s Adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion , a decrease of 47% year-on-year. StarWorld Macau's Adjusted EBITDA decreased 38% year-on-year to $509 million . Broadway Macau™'s Adjusted EBITDA was $(2) million .\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, GEG experienced bad luck in gaming operations which reduced Ajusted EBITDA by approximately $335 million , where the majority occurred at Galaxy Macau™.\nThe Group's total gaming revenue on a management basis [2] in the second quarter of 2015 decreased 38% year-on-year to $11.2 billion as total mass table revenue decreased 19% year-on-year to $3.9 billion and total VIP revenue dropped 47% year-on-year to $6.9 billion .\n[2] The primary difference between statutory revenue and management basis revenue is the treatment of City Clubs revenue where fee income is reported on a statutory basis and gaming revenue is reported on a management basis.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnasia.com/prnh/20150819/8521505390-b\nAccelerating Efficiency after Effective Opening\nConsistent with the successful opening of all new large projects, and to ensure absolute operational readiness on the opening day of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™, GEG recruited significant additional staff prior to opening. Inevitably this created a short-term mismatch of revenues and costs. This was an anticipated front-loaded investment to ensure that GEG's customers received the outstanding service and exceptional standards for which GEG is renowned. GEG is now focused on driving economies of scale and moving the property up the efficiency curve as it opens additional facilities to optimize its mass market appeal and revenues.\nCost Control Initiatives\nGiven the current challenging trading environment we have actively engaged in a review of our cost structures and implemented a number of cost saving initiatives while simultaneously opening two major resorts -- Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™. These initiatives are designed to align our costs with current revenues without compromising customer service standards where, as an example, we have implemented a salary freeze for all senior executives.\nBalance Sheet, Treasury Management and Special Dividend\nThe Group's balance sheet remains healthy. As of 30 June 2015 , cash on hand stood at $9.4 billion and net cash was $4.6 billion . Total debt increased from $2 billion at 31 March 2015 to $4.8 billion at 30 June 2015 due solely to a treasury management exercise where interest income on cash holdings exceeds corresponding borrowing costs. Following the successful launch of Galaxy Macau™ Phase 2 and Broadway Macau™, the Group will pay another special dividend of $0.14 per share on or about 30 October 2015 .\nGalaxy Macau™\nGalaxy Macau™ is the most important contributor to the Group revenue and earnings. In the first half of 2015, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 41% year-on-year to $3.2 billion , on the back of a 31% year-on-year reduction in revenue to $17.2 billion . Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA decreased 47% to $1.4 billion and reflects 35 days of operation of the expanded resort where we continue to ramp up and drive efficiencies. The Group expects to leverage economies of scale across the business as we open all outstanding gaming areas, hotel rooms, retail and F&B outlets. We also experienced bad luck in our gaming operations which reduced Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $250 million in the first half and $300 million in the second quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for the first half calculated under HKFRS was 19% (1H 2014: 22%), or 25% under US GAAP (1H 2014: 31%). Adjusted EBITDA margin calculated under HKFRS for the second quarter was 18% (Q2 2014: 22%), or 24% under US GAAP (Q2 2014: 31%). Bad luck reduced margin by approximately 100 basis points for the first half and 250 basis points in the second quarter.\nVIP Gaming Performance\nTotal VIP rolling chip volume in the first half of the year was $294 billion . This translated to revenue of $10.3 billion , 40% down year-on-year. Second quarter volume of $137.2 billion was 48% lower year-on-year and 12% down sequentially.\nVIP Gaming\nHK$'m\nQ2 2014\nQ1 2015\nQ2 2015\nQoQ%\nYoY%\n1H 2014\n1H 2015\nYoY%\nTurnover\n264,340\n156,645\n137,222\n-12%\n-48%\n517,174\n293,867\n-43%\nNet Win\n8,364\n5,623\n4,659\n-17%\n-44%\n17,061\n10,282\n-40%\nWin %\n3.2%\n3.6%\n3.4%\n3.3%\n3.5%\nMass Gaming Performance\nHalf-year mass revenue was $5.4 billion , down 15% year-on-year.
