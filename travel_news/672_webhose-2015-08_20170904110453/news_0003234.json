On the weekend we just weren’t able to get it done which was really disappointing,” said Ebert with the Bulldogs taking the game on using Port’s gut-running dare of impressive 2013-14 campaigns.\n“It was the biggest loss we have had this year in terms of points so when you are in that situation and working to win and maintain the momentum we created it was really disappointing.”\nThe Power, which has lost crack pair Jared Polec and Ollie Wines to season ending foot and shoulder injuries, has no choice but to get back on the horse, insisted Ebert.\nFundamental shortcomings in its game must be addressed after the 64-point drubbing against Luke Beveridge’s barnstorming Dogs.\n“Across the board there were a number of things. We fumbled the ball at times. Our skills weren’t up to it after quarter time,” Ebert said.\n“We missed kicks and handballs that cost us on the turnover. In defence they were able to handball through us and chip around.\n“With the four weeks left we have chance to rectify that.”\nPort will need all its stars to quell the Giants but in-form skipper Travis Boak didn’t train today at Adelaide Oval.\nAll-Australian bound forward Chad Wingard caused further concern, completing warm up exercises on Adelaide Oval No. 2 before leaving for treatment after consultation with a club medico. Wingard appeared to be troubled by leg soreness.", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9018760/", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9018760.js"], "published": "2015-08-12T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T05:01:34.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
