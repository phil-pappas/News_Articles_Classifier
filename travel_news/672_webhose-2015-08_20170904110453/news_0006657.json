FAA approves country's 10th commercial spaceport By Daisy Carrington for CNN POSTED: 12:35 AM PDT Aug 17, 2015 UPDATED: 10:50 AM PDT Aug 17, 2015 Land Rover MENA/Wikimedia Commons (CNN) - \nHouston, already home to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, is slated to add another notch to its aeronautic belt. Related Content \nThe Federal Aviation Administration has given the Texas city the go-ahead to build the United States' 10th commercial spaceport. \nIt's a move that begs the question: the United States already has nine spaceports? \nIt seems like an awful lot of infrastructure dedicated to an industry still in its infancy. \nSpace tourism was meant to have taken off years ago. \nWhen Virgin CEO Richard Branson first launched a \"mothership\" for his spaceflight venture Virgin Galactic, he predicted his company would be shuttling wealthy tourists to the edge of space by 2009, and over the decade 700 customers have paid up to $250,000 a pop for the promise of a bird's eye view of earth. \nThat possibility seems increasingly remote, and not abetted by last year's crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, which resulted in the death of the copilot and a handful of customers asking Virgin for a refund. \nOne of the biggest casualties of the industry's delays has been Spaceport America, a $200 million facility in New Mexico that depended on Virgin Galactic as its anchor tenant. \n\"Spaceport America borrowed money and built operations as if Virgin Galactic would be operating there already,\" notes William Ostrove, an aerospace and defense analyst for Forecast International. \n\"Because this has not happened, Spaceport America is in a little bit of trouble.\" \nWhile they wait for Virgin Galactic to move in, Spaceport America has had to readjust its business model. \nWhile the spaceport works to sign new clients -- CEO Christine Anderson says they're looking into unmanned vehicle testing -- the site has become an elaborate events space, hosting everything from school trips and corporate events to product launches. \n\"Airports don't make all their revenue from airplane landings; they have concessions, rental cars -- several I've talked to have hotels on land surrounding the facilities, she says. \n\"It's important to have a broad business model, both for airports and, I would argue, for spaceports.\" \nSpaceports, spaceports everywhere \nIn the last few years, spaceport projects have carried a certain amount of cache, and countries from every corner of the globe have announced plans for building their own. \nSweden and the United Kingdom are both hoping to build spaceports that will dominate the European space sector. \n\"Our vision is to develop Europe's gateway to space and offer services and infrastructure to space operators, space adventures and a platform for industry innovation,\" says Karin Nilsdotter, Spaceport Sweden's CEO. \nSpace tourism venture Space Adventures announced various plans to build spaceports in Singapore and the UAE, though haven't released any time frame. \n\"Governments want spaceports as a source of prestige, jobs and to act as engines for technological development,\" notes Ostrove. \nWhether there is or will ever be a market for them to survive, however, is another question. \n\"If the market for commercial space transportation grows substantially, there will be a huge demand for spaceports,\" he adds. \n\"In that best case scenario, there will likely be at least a few spaceports on each continent.\" \nWorst case scenario? \n\"If the market does not expand rapidly, or even fizzles totally, there will be almost no market at all for spaceports. We'll likely see somewhere in between.\" â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T05:23:53.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
