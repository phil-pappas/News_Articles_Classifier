One thing that's sure to leave a lasting impression is a thrilling helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon. You'll have several choices when it comes to helicopter tours, so you're sure to find one that fits the time and adventures that interest you. Best Time For You It gets hot in the canyon, and temperatures can sometimes hover well past 100 degrees. If you hate hot weather and prefer to stay cool, book an early morning tour or one that flies in the late evening. Morning air tours can be the perfect beginning to your day and still leave you with plenty of time for other fun. However, keep in mind, if you leave too early, your chopper will be flying into blinding sunlight that might hamper your ability to see well. Therefore, if you want to fly early and have the best sightseeing experience, you should pick a flight that departs between 8 am and noon. These morning flights usually have the best visibility anyway since the clouds haven't started building yet and the air is less turbulent. Since rising temperatures can cause storms and turbulence, the ride is also smoother. If you book an afternoon flight, it has a higher risk of being canceled due to frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Evening air tours can be a wonderful and romantic end to a beautiful day. It's cooler in the evening and you'll be treated to a colorful sunset view. Those particles kicked up during the day become part of the glow that happens at dusk. If you book a deluxe Grand Canyon helicopter tour, you will also get to see the beauty of Las Vegas coming to life at night, neon lights twinkling everywhere. The Difference In Helicopters Another important decision you have to make is the type of helicopter you will fly on during your tour. A lot of the tours use Bell Ranger helicopters, but the deluxe tours fly on EcoStar 130 aircraft. The Bell Rangers still offer great views, but your flight won't be as comfortable as a flight on an EcoStar. The EcoStar helicopters cover all the bases with comfortable seating, quieter flight, strong climate control, larger interiors and vast windows. So if you have the option, it's best to go with a deluxe version of the tour. South Or West Rim? You can choose to take a helicopter tour of the South Rim or the West Rim. The canyon's West Rim is more easily accessed from Las Vegas. Deluxe Vegas tours can add the luxury of taking a limo to your helicopter. If you want to tour the South Rim, you'll have to get there in a plane, bus, or car since it is too far away for choppers to make the flight from Vegas. If you want adventure and a closer look, West Rim tours can land on the canyon floor. However, if you are more interested in panoramic beauty, then touring the South Rim is ideal. If you want to look at awesome views and still have some adventure, you can upgrade your South Rim tour to include a Jeep tour of the canyon. Jeeps seat up to 9 and can go directly to many of the popular sights. The Ultimate Vacation Awaits A tour on a Grand Canyon helicopter is the perfect idea for a summer getaway. A Grand Canyon trip is perfect for a romantic celebration or a fun-filled family vacation. There are several tours and adventures you can choose from to match your interests. A fun vacation adventure awaits you. \n  going here for more info about helicopter tours .
