I finally joined here to ask a few question. My fiance(French Canadian) and I(Fijian born, American Citizen of Indian ethnicity) are thinking about getting married in India. This was the first country we traveled to together and has a special attachment to us both. This leads me to question 1 . Would it be easy for us to get married in India? I am Hindu and she is not. We are planning to be in India for about 4-6 months. Question 2: We are thinking about having a small wedding in the Himalayas. Specifically on Triund hill ouside McLeod Gang. How do I go about organizing things with a priest? Question 3: We want to have a very simple wedding, with only us and some friends to photograph and film. Is this possible or do we need witnesses ans such? I know I am missing a lot right now but please do chime in with any useful information. Thanks in advance!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T14:57:37.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
