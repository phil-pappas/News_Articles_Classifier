Wednesday marked the first day of bathing for those attending this year's festival on the banks of the Godavari River in Maharashtra state.\nMillions are expected to attend this year's two-month festival, which began in mid-July and runs until the end of September.\nThe Kumbh Mela derives its name from a mythical fight over a pitcher of holy nectar. According to Hindu mythology, gods and demons waged a furious battle over the nectar they needed to achieve immortality. Four drops spilled, landing in the four cities that alternatively host the festival: Allahabad, at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythic Saraswati rivers; Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges; Ujjain, in central India; and Nasik.\nThe festival is held four times every 12 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T03:01:40.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
