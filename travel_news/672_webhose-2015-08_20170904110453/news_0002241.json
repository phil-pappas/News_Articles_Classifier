At Athens airport, Greece's biggest, about 22 flights were called off and 173 rescheduled due to the four-hour stoppage, an airport spokeswoman said.\nThe civil aviation authority said it could not provide figures on how many flights were cancelled across the country but had informed passengers about possible delays.\nThe controllers want their government agency to be restructured and an independent one set up in line with European Union rules.\nThey say that this will help the country deal with staff shortages and a lack of funds for the maintenance of ATC systems.\nCash-strapped Greece is struggling to clinch a new bailout deal with its international lenders to stay afloat in the euro zone and get its economy back on its feet.\nTourism is a major cash earner, accounting for about one fifth of Greece's economic output.\nThe air traffic controller's union has threatened to step up action from August 14 if the government does not respond to its demands.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:23:44.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
