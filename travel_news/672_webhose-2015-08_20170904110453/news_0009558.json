Together they looked at challenges and agreed on doing more together, and this includes more joint work in China. \nMinister Alain St.Ange was on his way back to Seychelles after a two-day working visit where he led a tourism public-private sector delegation to get Seychelles and Ethiopian Airlines more known in Israel. \n\"I am thankful to Mr. Esayas WoldeMariam Hailu for making time to meet with me as I transited Addis Ababa. It was a great opportunity for us to analyze what the Seychelles Tourism Board was doing in the marketplace, and together we agreed on more joint actions that will be a win-win for both Ethiopian Airlines and for Seychelles,\" said Minister St.Ange at the airport in Addis Ababa. \nMr. Esayas WoldeMariam Hailu thanked the Minister for his passion for tourism saying that his Area Manager in Seychelles always speaks of the island minister's drive to make tourism succeed in Seychelles. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
