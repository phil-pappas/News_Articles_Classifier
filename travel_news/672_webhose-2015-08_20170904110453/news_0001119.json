Thousands were packed into a stadium in 45 degree heat waiting to be registered.

One is left to wonder what more the Greek authorities need to rise up to the occasion, take their responsibilities, and receive these people humanely and with dignity,” he said.

It’s double the number that arrived in the previous month and authorities have been struggling to cope, with people forced to live in filthy conditions or sleep in parks around the city. \nThis week, Greek police have tried to move people from urban areas towards a stadium on the edge of town where they can give their names to police to be registered. \nOvernight police officers worked to register more than 1000 people inside the stadium, however many were still outside waiting. \nKos Mayor Giorgos Kyritsis said the extra manpower means the process is operating more smoothly now. However with Greece taking over from Italy as the main entry point to Europe, it shows no sign of abating. \nRiot police have been sent to the area and Minister of State Alekos Flabouraris said a 2500 person cruise ship has also been dispatched to act as a processing centre. \nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called for European Union help with the crisis, as Greece struggles to deal with major economic woes.
