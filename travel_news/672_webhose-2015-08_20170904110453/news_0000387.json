in both aircraft they'll be arranged in a 2-4-2 layout.\nThe airline's entire superjumbo fleet will be fitted with premium economy \" by the first quarter of 2016\", Mak says.\n\"The 777s will take a little bit longer, until end of 2016, because we are installing the new premium economy at the same time as our new first class and business class .\"\n\"We want to reach a certain critical mass to be offering to customers to, hence our decision to go for a rapid and aggressive rollout to ensure we have critical mass of this product in the market.\"\nSingapore Airlines pegs total investment in the project as US$80 million.\nBut not all of the Airbus A350s are likely sport a premium economy cabin, with Mak indicating that a second tranche of A350 deliveries would adopt a two-class version without premium economy and intended for medium-range flights.\n“The exact number (of A350s) for long-haul flights is still something to be pinned down but certainly the first batch that will come in will be earmarked for long-haul flights and will have premium economy” Mak said.\nSingapore Airlines expects to have three Airbus A350 jets by March 2016, with at least the first 20 of the 70-strong order being a three-class fit-out with its latest business class, new premium economy and economy seats.\nMore exclusive Singapore Airlines news from AusBT New Singapore Airlines A380 first class suites, business class seats in 2017 Singapore Airlines lobbies Airbus, Boeing for ultra long-range jet New flagship Singapore Airlines lounges for Changi by 2017 we're @AusBT\nAbout David Flynn David Flynn is the editor of Australian Business Traveller and a bit of a travel tragic with a weakness for good coffee, shopping and lychee martinis.\nFollow @ausbt on\nEmail: [email protected]\nTwitter: @djsflynn\nShare this story Airline News Airport News Hotel News Lounge News Frequent Flyer News Reward Program News Tech News Travel Gear News Other News Search News Latest News Latest Cathay ANA Have ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T04:46:08.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
