Once again Brussels will show that it deserves its accolade of the world's comic book capital. Comic murals, museums and book shops will be in the spotlight, while special comic-themed activities will be popping up all over Brussels during the weekend. \nThe Brussels Comic Strip Festival will be held in Parc de Bruxelles/Warandepark but it will also extend well beyond the park’s confines: this year the whole of Brussels will be welcoming the world of comics over the weekend. Indeed Brussels is brimming with comic book locations that are not to be missed, with its 53 comic book murals dotted around the city, numerous specialist book shops and museums, comic book lovers are in their element in Brussels. \nThe major attractions linked together They will all come together for the Brussels Comic Strip Festival. And for the first time, a Mini Train will link all of these comic book hotspots. The free service runs through the Brussels streets starting from the entrance of the Comic Strip Festival. It will take visitors on a tour that covers several kilometres, passing by and stopping off at the Comics Art Museum, the Museum of Original Figurines, the Korean Cultural Centre (which will be holding its second comic book exhibition), the comic book murals, specialised book shops and other key attractions. \nFree guided tours Another way of discovering comic book haunts will be to take one of the free guided tours led by professional guides specialising in comic books. One such trip will be a walking tour of the comic murals dotted around the city: over the course of an hour and a half guides will tell the unique history behind the comic themed murals adorning the disused walls of the city . There will also be a three-hour bike tour, starting and finishing at the BIP (house of the capital region, right next to the marquees of the festival) heading off the beaten track to the Laeken quarter passing by comic book treasures such as the Corto Maltese mural and Laeken Park. The tours are available in French, Dutch and English with regular departures throughout the day. \nBD Pass To simplify things, for the first time this year the Brussels Comic Strip Festival is offering the BD Pass. Freely available at the Brussels Comic Strip Festival marquees, it gives holders special rates at museums, as well as discounts in bookshops and specialised stores in Brussels. \nSpecial activities at the Brussels Comic Strip Festival Alongside all of these events, several unique activities will be held. The Ligue d’improvisation belge professionnelle, in addition to its Festival performances, will offer attendees the opportunity to enjoy two of their shows to be held over the weekend at the Marni theatre. The special comic book-themed Impro Match (only in French) will take place with 3 performers and 2 illustrators taking part in the show. Together they will offer a humorous improvisation show combining theatre and art. \nThe Cinematek will also be screening a comic book-themed film every day during the weekend of the Brussels Comic Strip Festival. Figures from the comic world whose work inspired films, or vice versa, will introduce Signé Furax, Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot, and Snowpiercer. The films will be shown in their original language with Dutch and French subtitles. \nFinally, the City 2 shopping centre will be holding \"Comic Book Month\" in September, offering a special comic -themed schedule of events. What's more, during the weekend of the Brussels Comic Strip Festival, City2 will be inviting all comic book lovers to participate in a comic book picture marathon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:10:18.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
