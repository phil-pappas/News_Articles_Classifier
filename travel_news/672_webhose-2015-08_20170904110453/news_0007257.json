Here's what you can see and do in the capital around the festive season. \nYou may think it's too early to be planning for the holiday season. But when it comes to travel at this time of the year, the sooner you start preparing, the better. Your favourite London hotel, for example, will most likely be booked months in advance as thousands of visitors come to this amazing city each year specifically to enjoy the sights and traditions of the festive season. \nChristmas in London \nChristmas in London is one of the most evocative times of the year. Whether you’re a reader of classic English literature (Regency romances count!), or a fan of British cinema, you’ll no doubt notice that more often than not, they include Christmas scenes portrayed and described in loving detail. Anyone who’s ever read Dickens, for example, can't help but develop a fascination for the city, especially during the holiday season. Arguably Dickens’ greatest work, A Christmas Carol may start off with a grim premise, but goes on to paint Christmas in the city as full of charm and merriment, with visions of sleigh rides, shoppers laden with presents, carollers, families ice skating, parties, and Christmas feasts. And these traditions have endured throughout the ages, though perhaps slightly jazzed up for the modern world - such having champagne and croissants in your London hotel room as you open presents Christmas morning! Below, we present some particularly British Christmas traditions that will make your holidays in the UK capital truly memorable. \nExperience Christmas Past \nIf you’re a royal history buff, ask your London hotel concierge to get you some tickets to the Christmas at Kensington Palace celebration. Adults and children alike will love seeing the beautiful decorations, listening to music, eating delicious food, and participating in fun holiday games—all recreated from the times of the reign of King William II. \nSing Carols Around the Tree \nBritish people are big on Christmas trees, and decorating them is definitely one of the most beloved traditions. Although introduced to the country by George III's Queen Charlotte, their popularity soared during the reign of Queen Victoria. If you’re missing having a tree in your London hotel room, head down to Trafalgar Square to see the 20-metre tall Trafalgar Christmas tree—an annual gift from the citizens of Oslo to the British people—fully decorated and lit up with more than 500 Christmas lights. The tree is a favourite spot of carollers, which adds to the festive air. The tree-lighting ceremony takes place on the first Thursday of December and it remains on display until January 6th (Twelfth Night), so you’ll have plenty of time to see it. \nEnjoy a Winter Wonderland \nTake a walk outside your London hotel during the holiday season to catch a glimpse of the extravaganza that is the Winter Wonderland fair, held in Hyde Park from late November to early January. Experience all the magic of winter as you skate along with hundred of others on the ice rink, or explore the ice forest filled with ice sculptures and even an ice palace. There are also plenty of rides and shows—including circus acrobats, clowns, animal acts, and lots of stalls featuring great food and drink from all over the world. \nThere's really nothing quite like the magic of the UK capital at Christmas.
