Subscribe now to \nAlready a subscriber? Sign In Here Colleen DiPirro had a conversation recently that she never dreamed she would have. The president and CEO of the Amherst Chamber of Commerce was talking with a site selector for a new budget hotel that was considering the town of Amherst. “I told him, ‘Let’s see what’s happening in the marketplace in the next few years,’ ” she said. The town has welcomed a new hotel, Iskalo Development’s 138-room Hyatt Place , and there are plans for at least four others. If all are built, it would add 537 rooms in Amherst. Collectively, the hotel projects represent approximately $80 million in private-sector investment. And four of the five are proposed for what is vacant land that generates minimal property, school and special district taxes. “I really do want to see what happens,” DiPirro said. “Economically these investments could be great.” Besides Hyatt Place , other hotel projects in Amherst’s immediate economic development pipeline include the following: Uniland Development is considering a nationally branded hotel with six stories and 125 rooms in the University Corporate Centre. Canadian investor Sam Johal is looking at a Sweet Home Road parcel near the University at Buffalo campus for a 130-room Hyatt House. The hotel would be his first U.S. investment and the region’s first Hyatt House extended-stay property. Iskalo wants to reopen the renovated Lord Amherst on Main Street in Snyder as a 90-room boutique hotel. Along with its immediate neighbor, Hyatt Place , the hotel would anchor a hospitality campus Iskalo is developing on Main Street near the Youngmann Highway. Jay Patel this summer received approval from Amherst officials to build a five-story, 64-room hotel on Innskeeper Lane, just off Niagara Falls Boulevard. Johal said he considered building a hotel on that site, 1265 Sweet Home Road, eight years ago but a slumping national economy forced him to drop the plan. He said building in Amherst has always been high on his wish list. “The market and the economy are much more stable now than in 2008,” Johal said. “And the local hotel market is much more stable.” According to data for the first seven months of this year supplied by STR, formerly Smith Travel Research of Nashville, hotel occupancy in Amherst increased 2.9 percent, from 59.5 percent in 2014 to 61.3 percent. The average daily room rate rose 2.3 percent, from $96.56 last year to $98.79 this year. So what seems to be driving all of the interest? The University at Buffalo is a factor. So are Canadians, who continue to shop and use Buffalo Niagara International Airport despite the weakened loonie. Business travel remains a significant factor. “I want to remain positive,” said DiPirro of the Amherst chamber. “And as long as the occupancy and room rates remain high, it becomes easier to stay positive.” \nGet Buffalo Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:27:41.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
