World Travel Viking’s Ingvar plies 1100km in Russia known as the Waterways of the Tsars by: What are these? The sun rises over the Neva in St Petersburg. Picture: Getty Source: Getty Images \nTWENTY minutes from the heart of Moscow, longship Viking Ingvar is at rest in the Moscow Canal gently nudging the dock at North Port when the party begins. \nIn the Panorama Bar, the clinking of glasses of cocktails and premium wines is well under way when Jochen Kunkel takes the microphone. \n“Good evening,” the stout German maitre d’hotel from Cologne bellows cheerily at 200 guests assembled for their first night aboard. “I just want to tell you about dinner and let you know our executive chef Joachim Meier has outdone himself tonight,” he said. \n“We have lollo rosso salad and shaved serrano ham with raspberry dressing and it’s very yummy,” he effuses. “We have beef stroganoff with herbed noodles, beets, salted cucumbers and smetana, and that’s very, very yummy. \n“And, we also have bittersweet chocolate pots de creme and, I have to tell you, that that is extremely yummy,” he grins. “See you there.” \n“There” is the ship’s Neva Restaurant, a temple of fine dining for which Viking Cruises’ fleet of three longboats has become famous since the company launched their Russian river cruises in 1997. \nIngvar accommodates 210 guests in 104 staterooms and suites spread around three decks, all with private verandas, full-length sliding doors, river views, hotel-style beds with quality linens, flat-screen TVs, private bathrooms with L’Occitane toiletries, telephones, safes, refrigerators and free Wi-Fi. The Church of St Dmitry on Blood can be seen in Uglich, one of the towns that’s part of the “Golden Ring”.

There’s a sun deck with a shaded sitting area, an open-air promenade deck, elevator, observation lounge, two bar-lounges with vista windows and Neva Restaurant with panoramic views, open seating, fine wines, a choice of buffet or a la carte and elaborate five-course dinners. \nBetween May and October, the triple-deck riverboats ply continuously between Moscow and St Petersburg along an 1100km system of scenic rivers, lakes, canals, locks and reservoirs known as the Waterways of the Tsars. \nThe 13-day itineraries include four days exploring each city and five days cruising an arc of some of Russia’s oldest towns – dubbed the Golden Ring. \nGuests are generally English speaking, well-travelled professionals in the 55-plus range. With a destination-focused itinerary, Viking has skilfully combined a casual and convivial shipboard atmosphere with a detailed immersion into Russia’s history, arts, culture, politics, language and cuisine – with guides conducting on-board lectures and visits ashore. \nIn Moscow, tours include the Metro underground, St Basil’s Cathedral, galleries, museums, Red Square, GUM department store and the Kremlin. Port excursions from Moscow include a visit to the 19th century GUM department store on Red Square.

Silver birch forests, cherry orchards, dairy farms and summer dachas (cottages) slip past before Ingvar enters the scenic Sheksna River. \nIn the Panorama Bar, tour guide Sasha delivers a talk on Russian politics before a cooking class where chef Joachim Meier demonstrates how to prepare Siberian pelmeni (dumplings).

All are UNESCO World Heritage listed. \nFrom Lake Onega, the Svir River connects with the Neva River flowing west to St Petersburg, arguably Russia’s most beautiful city with a wealth of architectural and artistic treasures, especially the extraordinarily ornate Church of Our Saviour on Spilled Blood. \nA playground of Russian royalty, St Petersburg has an astonishing collection of fabulous palaces where tsars and empresses lived in gilt grandeur including the State Hermitage, Catherine Palace and Ingvar ’s final shore excursion, the confections of Peterhof Palace.
