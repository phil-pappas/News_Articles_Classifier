(AP) -- The Heart Mountain WWII Interpretive Center plans its annual pilgrimage Aug. 21-22. The center is a national historic landmark on the site where some 14,000 Japanese-Americans were confined near Cody during the war. This year's pilgrimage will mark efforts to return an original barrack to the site. The barrack is located in the town of Shell, where it's been used as a research facility by Iowa State University for more than 50 years. There's a fundraising effort going on to return it to the Heart Mountain site. Speakers at this year's pilgrimage will include former Sen. Al Simpson and former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta. The two became lifelong friends when Cody resident Simpson and Mineta, who was incarcerated at the camp, met as boy scouts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T07:44:51.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
