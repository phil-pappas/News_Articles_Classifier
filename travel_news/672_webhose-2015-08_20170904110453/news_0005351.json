Almost a mile high, Katahdin is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. By Beth J. Harpaz ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday August 9, 2015 5:00 AM \nBAXTER STATE PARK, Maine — I don’t remember much about my climb up Mount Katahdin 25 years ago. I was young and fit. It was no big deal. But my second climb is etched in my middle-aged mind with twinges of pain and fear — and much humility. \nMy husband and I started our hike up Mount Katahdin on a nice August day last summer about 8:30 a.m. We soon met people coming down the mountain and wondered how they had reached the peak so early in the day. Turns out they hadn’t gone far. They turned around when they realized how tough the climb is. \nKatahdin, located in Baxter State Park, is the tallest mountain in Maine — almost a mile high at 5,270 feet. \nBut it’s not just the physical challenge that makes Katahdin so challenging — though the relentless scramble over boulders without obvious footholds or handholds is exhausting. \nAnd it’s not just the distance — our route, Hunt Trail, was more than 10 miles round trip — or the scale of ascent, which traversed an elevation gain of 4,188 feet. It’s not even the unpredictable weather, although that nice summer day in which we began turned to rain, hail and 40-mph winds atop the mountain. \nIt’s the psychological aspects that are so daunting: fear of falling if you lose your grip on a tiny iron rung in a stone wall with a sheer drop below, fear of getting stuck in a crevice. And we didn’t even do Katahdin’s infamous Knife Edge, a narrow ridge with drop-offs on either side. \nOur biggest problem was time. On city streets, I can walk 3 mph. On Katahdin, climbing gingerly up an irregular course of sharp-edged boulders, fighting winds on exposed rock face, I averaged under a mile an hour. The hike I thought would take eight hours took 111/2. \nWhen we set out, a ranger asked whether we had a flashlight. I had nodded yes, but I had only a cellphone flashlight app. We never imagined we’d be hiking after sunset. Fortunately, I had shut down the phone to save battery power, so the app held out. We were lucky to be in flat forest by then. It would have been impossible to scramble down Katahdin’s granite blocks in pitch-black wilderness with one hand holding a phone. \nDo I regret last summer’s climb? Of course not. We considered turning back at times and got panicky after dark. But to have done it as a feckless 20-something and again as an out-of-breath 50-something whose muscles ached for days taught me that you don’t necessarily get smarter with age — just creakier. Mother Nature even celebrated our middle-aged triumph with a rainbow sighting from the top. \nFor others considering a climb, regardless of age, here’s my hard-won advice: \n• Be prepared. Take a headlamp for lighting up the dark. Wear hiking boots or trail runners; our sneakers were slippery on the rocks. Wear sunscreen; take water and food; and be prepared for rain, wind and cold. Baxter Park has recorded 47 fatalities since 1962, 20 of them above the tree line — including falls, lightning strikes and cardiac arrest. Rescues are exceedingly difficult there, and help is hours away. At least once each summer, someone sits down on the trail in the dark and waits until morning to get out, said park director Jensen Bissell. \n• Drive up the night before. Reservations for campsites, motels and parking go fast. Rangers start giving away reserved parking spots at \n7 a.m. We got the last parking spot for Hunt Trail at 8 a.m. on a weekday. \n• Research your route. There are a half-dozen trails up Katahdin. The mountain’s peak is the northern terminus for the Appalachian Trail, which begins in Georgia, and the trail we picked coincides with the Appalachian Trail. We got to watch as hardy hikers who had started months earlier completed their triumphant homestretch there. \nAs we drove away along dark country roads to our vacation house in central Maine, I looked out the window and saw the Big Dipper so bright and low in the sky it seemed close enough to touch. \nMy husband started to pull over for a look when an enormous moose emerged from the darkness, as if in a dream, loping across the road into our headlights. \nWe sped up and passed it with inches to spare. \nThe close call was a fitting end to a long day in the Maine wilderness — a day that made me grateful to be alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:55:36.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
