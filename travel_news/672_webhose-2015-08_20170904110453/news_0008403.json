The campaign includes a new website, promotional show reel and what is believed to be the first ever live chat function for a London venue. “The ‘Events with Personality’ campaign is about telling our story to event planners and brands who are looking for something with more character than the average venue, comments Alicia Duncan, General Manager of The Mermaid. “As a team we work hard to ensure that our client’s events are enhanced by the personality of our venue and our people; this is what we believe makes us different and gives them a distinctive experience.” The launch of ‘Events with Personality’ follows an 18 months programme of further investment and refurbishment which has included the installation of a new Bose acoustic audio visual system and a complete refresh of its communal areas. The Mermaid has a range of rooms including a multipurpose 600 seat purpose built tiered auditorium, 400 seat stage and the River Rooms, which with views of the Thames and the London skyline can accommodate receptions for up to 800.
