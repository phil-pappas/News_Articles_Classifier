Located just moments from Knightsbridge, Buckingham Palace and Hyde Park, The Lanesborough is London’s finest residence and one of the city’s most iconic hotels. The new hotel emulates the style and impeccable service of its French sister Le Bristol while staying true to the hotel’s strong British roots. \nHaving closed its doors on 20th December 2013, the Grade II* listed building was taken back to its shell and has been totally transformed by Cabinet Alberto Pinto. The renovation honours the building’s architectural heritage as one of London’s most revered Regency landmarks. The hotel comprises 93 rooms and suites including The Royal Suite, which extends to seven bedrooms. Executive Chef Florian Favario oversees The Lanesborough’s new restaurant, Céleste, hailing a new culinary era for the hotel. Strengthening the relationship with Le Bristol, Favario is the former Head Chef of Le Bristol’s three-Michelin starred restaurant Epicure and the protégé of Chef Patron Eric Frechon who will oversee the menu. French inspired, the cuisine is modern and imaginative, using only the best of British ingredients. Daily afternoon tea is a traditionally British affair, with a Tea Sommelier on hand to guide guests through an extensive tea menu. To add to the extensive services offered to all guests, 23 private butlers are on call day and night to care for the individual needs of every guest, while a fleet of 14 luxury cars including a Rolls Royce Phantom can chauffeur residents around London in impeccable style. Each one of The Lanesborough’s seven new private dining rooms possesses a character and atmosphere of its own - from the intimate feel of The Wine Cellar to the palatial setting of The Belgravia. With a sizable collection of Cuban and pre-Castro cigars as well as rare Cognacs dating back to 1770, The Garden Room is the ideal setting for a night of relaxed sophistication. With a celebrated walk-in humidor and knowledgeable team, this garden terrace is a favourite amongst cigar connoisseurs. For cocktails, The Library Bar offers a touch of grandeur in a warm and welcoming setting. A live pianist plays each night from 6-9pm creating an intimate, club-like atmosphere. A team of artisans using age-old techniques, often used in decorating Palaces, were entrusted to deliver a distinctive form of luxury, befitting for The Lanesborough. The craftsmen were all specialists in their fields and include embroiderers, crystal specialists, cabinetmakers, bronzers, lacquerers, gilders, mirror specialists, and makers of decorative trimmings. Over 300 people were involved in the day-to-day transformation of the hotel’s 93 rooms, allowing for exceptional time and care to be taken into each detail. Everything is handcrafted to perfection, with over 2,000 hours of stenciling in the public areas of the hotel as well as 5,500 original stencils showcased throughout guest rooms and within The Library Bar. Particular focus has been paid to the ceilings through restoring original detailing such as ceiling roses, coffering, cornicing and fresco painting. Award-winning British artisans in plaster produced a unique plasterwork design for each room upon Cabinet Alberto Pinto’s request and control. 2,100 books of 23 ¼ carat gold leaf were used to elaborately dress the ceilings of public areas and guest rooms, reimagining the Regency period and reflecting the heritage of the building. The majority of suppliers used for the renovation are British with over 95% made bespoke for The Lanesborough. Every trimming and finishing is made to measure, before going through specialist procedures to meet hotel safety standards. The Royal Suite has been reinstated as The Lanesborough’s largest suite, extending across 4485 square feet, with seven bedrooms and bathrooms, two living rooms and a dining room exuding exquisite taste, impeccable British craftsmanship and attention to period detail. The Lanesborough Suite carries every hallmark of its distinguished designer, with four bedrooms and five bathrooms, two living rooms and a dining room as well as a kitchen and private entrance for the butler. Cabinet Alberto Pinto imagined guest rooms being grouped into five design schemes, reflecting the Regency period, with each group consisting of three rich jewel colour ways to create warmth, harmony and comfort. 14 different types of bed canopies hang within the rooms, with over 3 million hand stitches and bespoke tailoring using the highest quality fabrics. Each marble block for the new bathrooms was individually chosen and acute attention was given to ensure that each slab was perfectly book matched. World-renowned British perfumer Roja Dove has created bespoke fragrances and bathroom amenities for every guest room. The Lanesborough is recognised as a building of special architectural and historic interest with a Grade II* listed status. ReardonSmith acted as Lead Design Consultant and Architect with responsibility for coordinating the renovation of the hotel in close collaboration with the interior designer, Cabinet Alberto Pinto.
