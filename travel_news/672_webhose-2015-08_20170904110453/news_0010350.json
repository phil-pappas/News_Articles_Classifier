The shift of choice and the growing confidence are going to influence the global travel industry in a number of ways.\nAmong the BRIC nations, China always had an upper hand as far as attracting business investment is concerned. Even five years ago, India was perhaps the least lucrative country for foreign investors. However, India is now the third largest economy in Asia and investors have marked the country as a positive investment destination.\nIn a survey conducted by JP Morgan during December 2014 and January 2015, 30 investment professionals of North American firms revealed their state of interest. Sectors like financials, industrials, consumer goods & services, technology and healthcare topped the list of the most attractive sectors over the next 12-18 months.\nFollowing the encouraging outlook of the North American investment sector and their interest in India, the country is set to experience a surge in business traveling. Hotels and hospitality groups offering conference facilities are expected to cash the opportunity and ensure superior service.\nThe recent crash of the Chinese stock market can fuel further interest about the Indian market among the North American investors. The result again will reap dividends for the Indian travel industry. To say the least, India is gaining a huge international attention and a comprehensive growth in the travel industry is not a distant vision anymore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:14:23.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
