A cruise ship without a buffet?\nP&O Cruises are saying bye, bye to the traditional buffet and hello to a brand new dining experience.\nBanishing trays, queues and the all-you-can-eat smorgasbord, the cruise line’s latest concept is named “The Pantry”, and is similar to an up-market food hall where passengers can choose between eight different stations and have their meals individually plated.\nThere’s a “Kettle & Bun” bar with sandwiches and soups, the “Fat Cow” bar for a traditional roast dinner, “Mexicana” gives you your taco fix, “Curry House” brings you a taste of Indian cuisine as well as an Asian food bar, coffee bar and fish and chips stand. And when you’re ready for dessert, the “Sugar Bar” offers homemade cakes and pastries.\nLooking more like a chic hotel lobby than a cruise ship.

It’s a game-changer — and it’s clear from our guests’ reaction that they love it,” P & O Cruises Senior Vice President Sture Myrmell said.\n“The Pantry is a dining experience like no other at sea. Designed as an international food market, it features eight bespoke outlets reflecting the many flavours Australians love to eat.”\nSoft shell tortillas from the Mexican stand had a choice of fillings including chicken, fish, rice and pork. As well as options for toppings including guacamole, sour cream and cheese served with a slice of corn bread.\nAt the Indian bar, passengers could choose from chicken, fish and vegetarian curry with a side of naan bread and raita.\nFor those not scared of a piece of meat, the “Fat Cow” bar offered carved slices of meat from a giant roast lamb along with the traditional accompaniments of roasted vegetables and potatoes.\nThe interior has also changed. Round tables and carpet have been replaced with a mix of bench seats and intimate tables, mosaic tiles give it contemporary chic, cutlery is wrapped in beach style napkins in baskets and homely bookcases stocked with vases and plants create a relaxed vibe.\nDespite earlier patron concerns, dining at “The Pantry” will still be all inclusive in the ticket price. “The Pantry” is currently available on the Pacific Jewel, and will unveiled on the Pacific Aria and Pacific Eden later this year.\nTake a seat by the window for views out over the ocean.
