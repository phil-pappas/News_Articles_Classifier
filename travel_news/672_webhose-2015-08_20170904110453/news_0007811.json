It gives artists the opportunity to discuss, share experiences, learn from one another and share their knowledge and traditions. \nAll men and women are alike in their beauty. Armed with this strong belief, Haiti opens its doors to welcome the Caribbean and the world from August 21st to August 30th, 2015. \nCARIFESTA XII activities will be held in five (5) cities across the island: Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, Cap-Haitian, Gonaives, and Cayes. All disciplines will be featured: dance, cuisine, fashion, cinema, visual arts, literature, music, theater, arts and crafts. \nCARICOM \nCARICOM (Caribbean Community) - the 14 member countries, including Haiti - has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that this 12th edition in Haiti continues to fulfill the legacy of CARIFESTA being a Great Cultural and Artistic event since 1972. \nAccommodation \nHaiti is able to accommodate its many guests at the 12th edition of CARIFESTA from August 21 to August 30, 2015. \nAgreements have been made with the hotels for special packages and attractive rates for CARIFESTA season. \nImpacts \nGovernment funding has been allocated to make this great international event possible in Haiti. The event will also be supported by private sector sponsors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:00:53.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
