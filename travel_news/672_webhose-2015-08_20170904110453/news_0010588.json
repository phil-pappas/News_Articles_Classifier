It comes amid escalating wildlife trafficking run by organised criminal syndicates who utilise commercial airlines to smuggle endangered species across countries and continents.\nThe initiative comes at a time when poaching and illegal trade of trophy has persisted on the global arena but more so in Kenya where the population of elephants and rhinos is threatened.\nKenya Airways CEO Mr. Mbuvi Ngunze said as a leading airline in the region Kenya Airways has a major responsibility to support the efforts of the international community to fight against illegal wildlife trafficking.\n“As KQ we are against movement of trophies of elephants and rhinos among other endangered species on our planes as part of our efforts to prevent the illegal trade and poaching of our wildlife. We note that as a result of globalization and the ease of long distance travel, wildlife traffickers are exploiting commercial airlines to smuggle illicit wildlife products.” He said during the opening of the workshop at KQ Pride Centre.\nMbuvi noted KQ remained committed to playing a significant role in curbing poaching and illegal trade of wildlife. The airline currently runs a ‘Change for Change’ programme on its airplanes where passengers can donate their change which is collected and donated to conservation initiatives.\nThe illicit wildlife trade is estimated to generate US$19 billion a year globally, ranking fourth on the list of the most lucrative illegal activities, behind drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking.\n“We are delighted to have helped facilitate this important workshop. Airline staff have a crucial role to play in the fight to stop illegal trafficking of endangered wildlife and plants. Training such as this can raise awareness and give employees the tools to help prevent the shocking destruction of our biological heritage. We look forward to holding similar productive sessions with concerned stakeholders across the region,” said Tony Tyler, IATA’s Director General and CEO.\nThe training comes two months after IATA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with CITES (Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).\nSource:- Kenya Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T21:02:12.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
