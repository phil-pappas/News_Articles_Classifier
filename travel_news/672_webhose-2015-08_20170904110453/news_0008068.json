The circuit will boast components such as a railway dining attraction, salt complex, caravan park, cycling track and night safari, among other things. \n\nAn additional US$9.5 million will also be spent on developing the town of Pushkar in the Ajmer district of Rajasthan. The area is well-known for its religious and cultural sites. \n\nBhim Singh, chairman of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) Rajasthan chapter, said: “We are further requesting help to increase the air connectivity within the state by asking international and domestic airlines to fly to destinations like Udaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer.” \n\nVasundhra Raje, chief minister of Rajasthan, also urged the government to fund tourist infrastructure projects that are yet to be completed due to the disruption caused by state and national elections in 2014. \n\nAnother US$10.7 million has also been earmarked for the development of Hope Island in Andhra Pradesh as a coastal and ecotourism circuit. \n\nRanga Reddy, chairman of IATO’s Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Chapter, said: \"The (allocation) of financial aid to develop this area is a good gesture, but we also need to employ and train staff who can protect the biodiversity and to attract visitors at same time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:09:40.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
