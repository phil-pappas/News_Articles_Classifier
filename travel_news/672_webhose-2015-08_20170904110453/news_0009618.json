Well you wouldn't really expect this resultâ€¦ \nIn proof that sometimes brains beat brawn, a video uploaded by Kruger Sightings shows a small baby bird captured by a leopard. \nThe little bird's mother can be heard screeching at the leopard and little hope seems left for the chick. \nHowever the chick frees itself from the leopard's grasp. The leopard recaptures the bird - but the battle is not over yet. \nThe chick does something incredibly smart - when it next dashes away, it heads straight for the water. \nThe leopard tries to recapture the bird, but jumps as soon as its paw hits the water. \nThe little bird then makes off happily while the leopard looks defeated. \nWatch the adorable and funny video below: Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T19:49:35.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
