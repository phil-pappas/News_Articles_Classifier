The announcement comes on the heels of MASTERPIECE earning 17 nominations for the 2015 Primetime Emmy® Awards. The new sponsorship deal will extend through 2016 and will support programming that includes the sixth and final season of the Emmy® Award-winning series Downton Abbey, as well as the hit series Mr. Selfridge, the Emmy®-nominated Sherlock, the popular new series Poldark and the upcoming Indian Summers. Viking first came onboard as a MASTERPIECE national corporate sponsor in 2011. MASTERPIECE is presented on PBS by WGBH Boston. \"It is our view that successful partners should enjoy growth together, and that is certainly the case for our partnership with MASTERPIECE,\" said Richard Marnell , Senior Vice President of Marketing for Viking River Cruises. \"Together with MASTERPIECE, we engage with audiences of people who strongly believe in enriching their lives through the arts, culture, history and exploration. We are proud to continue our relationship with MASTERPIECE, and we congratulate them on this year's Emmy nominations.\"\"MASTERPIECE and Viking River Cruises has been a dream partnership; our viewers and their current and potential travelers are cut from the same cloth,\" said MASTERPIECE Executive Producer Rebecca Eaton. \"Viking's support of our expanded MASTERPIECE schedule, including Wolf Hall and Grantchester, has worked well for everyone. Sail on, Viking!\"\"We are thrilled that Viking has extended their corporate support of MASTERPIECE,\" added Suzanne Zellner , VP Sales for WGBH's Sponsorship Group for Public Television. \"Viking's long-term partnership with MASTERPIECE demonstrates that PBS sponsorships work, and help build business for sponsors.\"In addition to its MASTERPIECE sponsorship - and as a response to the incredible popularity of Downton Abbey - Viking also offers its guests an optional excursion to Highclere Castle, the setting of the hit series. The Oxford & Highclere Castle pre- or post- trip experience is available for guests on the Cities of Light or Paris & the Heart of Normandy itineraries. Co-created with the owners of Highclere Castle, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, Viking guests spend three days in the rolling hills of England's countryside, with a champagne welcome and special tour of the famous home. As a response to increased traveler demand for Viking's destination-focused cruises, the company expanded its river offerings in 2015 with the launch of new award-winning Viking Longships® and new European itineraries. Since entering the North American market in 2000, Viking has continued to set industry standards with best-in-class river cruise ships, award-winning service, outstanding quality and all-inclusive itineraries offered at a competitive price. In early 2015, Viking officially expanded into the ocean cruise market and with the launch of its first ocean ship, the 930-passenger Viking Star® - marking the arrival of the travel industry's first entirely new cruise line in a decade. In June, Viking \"floated out\" its second ship, Viking Sea® at Fincantieri's Ancona shipyard. Viking Sea is set to launch in early 2016, and the company's third ship on order, Viking Sky®, is currently under construction for debut in early 2017. All three ships will sail popular routes in Scandinavia and the Baltic; and the Western and Eastern Mediterranean.
