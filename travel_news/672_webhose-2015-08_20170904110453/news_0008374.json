It looked like Gilliam had an overall nice night in his first game as the starter at right tackle, especially in largely keeping Justin Houston away from Russell Wilson. But the Seahawks struggled to run the ball all night and especially early, with just 36 yards on 18 attempts in the first three quarters. Gilliam said later that while he liked much of what he did, he knows the running game will be an area where he has to continue to work. “I’ve got to get a lot lower in the running game,” he said.”Drop my feet, dump some more people.Passing game, be a little bit more active with my hands. But for a first game out there I didn’t think it was too bad. A lot of room to grow.”\n2, The Seahawks need to not let penalties be an issue again this season. Seattle has struggled with penalties the last few years, and tonight did not set a great tone as Seattle had 11 for 105 yards. A few were certainly debatable, especially a couple of the roughing calls on quarterbacks. Still, coach Pete Carroll said he wouldn’t let his team off that easy. “I am not putting it on the officials at all,” he said. “We have to do better.” He also said “it was not a good night making decisions on the QB.” Carroll knows the NFL more than ever is going to watch anything with QBs closely. The Seahawks will need to adjust.\n3, I’m not sure any of the “bubble” receivers stood out. We’ve written a lot about the receivers at the bottom of the depth chart and if they have a shot at the roster. Nothing really appeared to get settled tonight, though. B.J. Daniels, who has seemed to be making a real run at a roster spot, had one clear drop of a pass and another that he got his hands on that would have been a tough grab but not impossible and the kind guys fighting for roster spots have to make. Kasen Williams had one catch for 11 yards but only one other target. Kevin Smith didn’t have any targets. The overall offense was sort of sluggish, and maybe the coaches will decide the receivers just didn’t really have much of a chance. But at first glance, it didn’t appear anyone really moved the needle tonight.\nMost Read Stories Interactive map of wildfires in the U.S. Thousands in state wrestle to tame relentless infernos Washington wildfires rage; Obama declares state of emergency Firefighters killed near Twisp: ‘three big heroes protecting small towns’ How to help — and 9 other things to know about the wildfires 4, Michael Bennett and Frank Clark working inside together could be interesting. Clark and Bennett got a few snaps together inside at tackle, something Carroll said “we have been testing since the first couple of days we have been here.” Clark had a sore ankle and at first wasn’t expected to play but ended up getting what Carroll said was “13, 14 plays just to get him back out there.” Regardless, it’s a sign of how big of a role the team expects Clark to play this season.\n5. DeShawn Shead’s versatility might keep him on the team. Shead has been a jack of all trades for this team for a few years now, a role he could have again this season. He’s played almost solely at strong safety through camp with Kam Chancellor out. But the Seahawks appear to be liking Dion Bailey more in that role now. So Shead instead played against the Chiefs at cornerback to help fill in at spot where seven players were out with injuries on Friday. KC seemed to notice, throwing a deep pass to Albert Wilson on Shead on the first play, the ball going incomplete. Carroll said he thought Shead held up well against what is a good group of receivers, which might bode well for his chances to stick.\n6, The run blocking might make it difficult to really tell much about Christine Michael. The much-discussed running back got to play the second and third quarters. But often having little room to run, he rushed for just 27 yards on 10 carries. Carroll made clear afterward that he put most of the run game issues on the line and not the backs saying “I don’t think we got the spacing that we needed for what we ran.” Ultimately, Michael’s best play might have been a block of an oncoming rusher that cleared the way for R.J. Archer to hit Tyler Lockett for 25 yards in the third quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:32:47.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
