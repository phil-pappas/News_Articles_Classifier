Not so grand ... The Grand Yazici Mares hotel, Icmeler, In Turkey is under fire for dressing up as faux terrorists. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nHOLIDAYMAKERS at a luxury hotel feared for their lives after hotel staff dressed as mock terrorists in a “joke” attack just months after the Tunisia massacre. \nThe Sun reports that British tourist Jason Phythian said he paid more than $10,000 to stay at the five-star Grand Yazici Mares hotel in Icmeler, on Turkey’s Dalmatian Coast, along with his wife, Maureen, sister Dawn Sutton, as well as her husband David and nine-year-old son, Tyler. \nThe 43-year-old said the tourists, many of them British, were panicked after mock terrorists complete with fake beards and headdresses pulled out a water canister marked ‘fuel’ and pulled out a lighter. Disgusted ... Jason Phythian said he had a canister emptied over him. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nIt comes just six weeks after Seifiddine Rezgui opened fire on tourists in Sousse, Tunisia, killing 38 people, including 30 Brits. \n“There were loads of British people round the pool, and suddenly everyone became terrified,” he told The Sun . “I looked round and saw Arab-looking guys stalking around and above the pool carrying big guns.” \n“(My sister) Dawn had been haunted by the news of the Tunisia attack and ... you could see in her face that she thought her worst nightmare was coming true,” he said. “One ran up to me with a bucket with ‘Fuel’ written on the side. He threw it over me and got out a cigarette lighter. I jumped up, not knowing what on Earth was going on. It was disgusting to try and make light of Tunisia in that way.” \nMr Sutton said his family ran for their lives. \n“I joined the crowd of British people who rushed down to the hotel manager to complain,” he said. Remembering the attack ... An Islamic State gunman on the beach at the resort town of Sousse in Tunisia.

The management now understands some of the costumes may have caused offence and will no longer use these in their shows.” \nThe mock attack comes as Australian tourists were evacuated from a resort in Vanauatu after a terrifying arson attack. \nThe 21 holiday-makers were forced to flee their accommodation on the island of Tanna after petrol bombs were hurled and vehicles set alight. \nOne Australian woman — who local media said was in Vanuautu to help with the Cyclone Pam recovery effort — reportedly suffered facial injuries after she was hit with rocks and stones. \nThe owner of the resort told Radio New Zealand a group of youths had been harassing him for months and had caused over $US2 million worth of damage is a series of arson attacks after he refused to give them money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:42:42.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
