Fares for additional kilometers are ₡610 ($1.13) for sedan-type taxis and cabs adapted for disabled people. For taxis in rural areas each additional kilometer costs ₡770 ($1.42). Costs for waiting also vary according to the service type.\nFares for taxis providing transportation services at Juan Santamaría International Airport will not be discussed at this hearing.", "external_links": ["http://aresep.go.cr/usuarios/noticias/1371-audiencias-publicas-agosto"], "published": "2015-08-04T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:48:08.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
