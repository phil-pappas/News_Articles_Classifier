More than 100 top pentathletes from around Europe will compete at the championships, which will be a significant opportunity to try and achieve the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. There are eight places for men and eight places for women on offer in the individual finals at the weekend.\nThe modern pentathlon is an Olympic sport that comprises five events: fencing, 200m freestyle swimming, show jumping and a final combined event of pistol shooting and a 3200 m cross-country run. The sport has been a core sport of the Olympic Games since 1912.\nThe athletes will travel from 20 different countries on services operated by KLM, bmi regional, easyJet and Brussels Airlines, with many making long haul connections via Amsterdam, Munich and Frankfurt. They will be met at the airport by a welcoming committee from the University with transport arranged for their transfer to Bath.\nPeter Downes, Head of Aviation Development at Bristol Airport, said:\n“Bristol Airport is delighted to welcome the athletes to the South West from countries ranging from A to U – Austria to the Ukraine. It justifiably puts the University of Bath on the world’s centre stage for sport. For some, this will be a first visit to the region, so we wanted to play our part in ensuring their first impressions were positive.\n“By flying into Bristol Airport rather than a congested airport outside the region, the athletes will reduce their onward journey, meaning they will arrive relaxed with more time to prepare for the sporting challenges they will face over the next few days.\n“We work closely with Bath Tourism Plus in promoting the many benefits to inbound international visitors of using Bristol Airport as a gateway to the region. This is one more demonstration of Bath being a destination of choice, adding valuable benefits to the regional economy. ”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:12:25.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
