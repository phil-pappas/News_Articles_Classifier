The event created a good deal of buzz because Vienna had not seen a luxury hotel opening in a long while. The Park Hyatt is now a serious competitor to the city’s well-known luxury hotels such as the Bristol and the Sacher.\nLocation The Park Hyatt Vienna is in the picturesque Am Hof Square in the first district, a central neighborhood that is a Unesco World Heritage site because of its concentration of such historical attractions as St. Stephen’s cathedral and Hofburg Palace. High-end international retail brands like Prada and Louis Vuitton as well as local favorites like the department store Steffl are within a five-minute walk, the Metro is right outside the hotel, and taxis are parked in front.\nThe Room There are 12 room categories including the 8,826-square-foot Royal Penthouse Suite, and all have modern décor with a handful of traditional accents. In our Studio King, the second category, the large white marble entryway opened to the main bedroom, which was furnished with a chaise longue and an oval wood desk as well as old-fashioned-style gold-leaf lamps and a gold and lapis woven wall hanging resembling an early 20th-century ladies’ brooch. The 40-inch television was concealed behind a mirror, and the comfortable bed had a leather headboard with a touch panel screen controlling the curtains and lights. We could also see a glimpse of St. Stephen’s from our window.\nThe Bathroom Pleasantly large, the bath had white marble floors and counters, double hammered-silver sinks, a deep tub, a spacious shower and fluffy white terry-cloth robes and slippers. We couldn’t get enough of the citrus-scented toiletries custom-made for the hotel by the French perfumer Blaise Mautin.\nAmenities A major draw is the hotel’s all-day restaurant, the Bank, which serves classic cuisine from different European countries, using local products. The spacious restaurant is housed in what was the bank’s former main cashier hall and has towering, beautifully restored ceilings and an open kitchen design. There are also two bars including a wood-paneled cigar bar and a lounge serving small bites and afternoon tea. The basement level has the Arany Spa, with its six treatment rooms including one for couples, a 50-foot-long pool where the bank’s former vault had been and a large fitness center. Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is free.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Breakfast The buffet breakfast is 33 euros and served in the Bank starting at 6:30 a.m. The generous and tasty spread included five kinds of fresh juice, house-made granola, several kinds of bread including dark rye, an array of in-season fruit like sugar-sweet tangerines, close to a dozen cakes and pastries, cheese from nearby farms, cured meats, eggs made to order and smoked salmon. Room service is also available.\nBottom Line With an unbeatable location near popular attractions, standout service and luxe touches, the Park Hyatt is an easy choice for travelers looking for high-end but contemporary accommodations in Vienna. It’s a departure from many other luxury hotels in town that have a more traditional and slightly stuffy feel, and, although it’s part of a chain, the historical former bank setting gives it a nongeneric, authentic sensibility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T16:04:25.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
