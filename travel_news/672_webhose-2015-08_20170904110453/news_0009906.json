Source: Facebook \nCHEZNYE Emmons was on a dream holiday with her boyfriend Joe Cook in Indonesia when tragedy struck. \nThe 23-year-old British backpacker started feeling unwell after drinking from a bottle marked as gin that she’d bought from a local shop in Bukit Lawang, near Sumatra. \nIt had been poisoned with methanol. \nWithin days, she was unable to see and suffered convulsions. She had to travel for hours through the jungle before reaching hospital where she was placed in an induced coma. \nHer parents Pamela and Brenton made the decision to turn off her life support. Her family are still pushing for the posters to be distributed.

But we seem to have hit a brick wall. We have 20,000 posters in boxes waiting to be delivered.” \nBut they have had success in getting a detailed warning posted on the National Health Service. \nThis is the article published on the NHS Choices page. I'd like to Thank Steven Shukor for writing such a good article....
