James Martin, Europe Travel Location and Population of Florence: \nFlorence is in the heart of Italy's Tuscany Region in western Italy along the Arno river. It is 172 miles north of Rome and 185 miles south of Milan. Florence is the capital of the region of Tuscany, and has a population of around 400,000 people, with around 200,000 more in suburban areas. When to Go \nThe narrow lanes of Renaissance Firenze are clogged with sweating tourists in July and August. Spring (April and May) or Autumn (September and October) are much better, although it's still tourist season. Tourists flock to Florence at Easter as well. November can be ok if you bring warm clothes and expect some rain. \nTo check on historic climate conditions for the time you're planning to spend in Florence, see: Florence Travel Weather . Florence Airport: \nThe Aeroporto di Firenze , commonly referred to as Aeroporto Amerigo Vespucci or simply Peretola, is located 4 km from the center of Florence. A taxi can make the trip in 15 minutes, and the Sita/Ataf \"Fly by Bus\" between the airport and Santa Maria Novella railway station takes 20 minutes. If you are coming into Florence from an international destination, you are probably using Galileo Galilei airport, closer to Pisa. Florence: Transportation Options \nFlorence's central station is called Santa Maria Novella. It is located in the northwest corner of central Florence. Many services, including stores and internet points, are located within the station.

Tripe is also a specialty, as is the bread soup called ribollita. Tuscan starters include crostini and bruschetta , toasted bread with various toppings. \nTo learn more about Tuscan cuisine and get some typical recipes you can try at home (or in your vacation rental), see: Tuscan Cooking . \nEating in restaurants can be a bit tricky in tourist-packed Florence.

The Ponte Vecchio - The Old Bridge looks from the outside as if it were still crowded with the crammed blacksmith and butcher shops of the medieval period, but it's all glittery gold and tourist baubles today. Spared from bombing in WWII, it used to be built of wood but a rebuild in the 1300's made it mostly stone. Free, unless you run afoul of a jewelry or porcelain statue salesman. The Church of San Lorenzo - It's not impressive from the outside, but it's probably the oldest religious structure in Florence. They say it was probably founded before year 400 and its art holdings include stuff by Donatello and Bronzino. \nFor more things to do in Florence, see the Top 10 Things to do in Florence , from Italy for Visitors. \nFor a map of the main attractions in Florence, see the interactive Florence Map .
