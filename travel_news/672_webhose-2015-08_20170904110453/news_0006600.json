It’s our aim to reduce this as much as we can. This rail line is only going to get busier in the coming years as demand for passenger and freight services increases, so it’s important we find a way forward.”\nSuffolk County Council’s cabinet member for highways and transport, Cllr James Finch said: “I am hopeful that we can find a solution that fits with the needs of the local community and solves this issue that has clearly divided opinion in the past.”\nMid-Suffolk district Cllr Wendy Marchant, ward member for Needham Market, said: “I am really pleased that Network Rail and the community are now constructively engaging in a conversation about the Gipsy Lane crossing. My own opinion is that an underpass would be ideal. It is a well-used pathway and the future of the crossing requires careful consideration.”\nResidents’ representative, Graham Oxenham, said: “A concern upon closing the level crossing is the potential for increased risk of pedestrian injury on alternative routes, and accessibility for existing less-able users. The local preference is for an underpass. It’s great that all parties now meet together under one roof to share issues, with the aim of finding the optimal solution at Gipsy Lane.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:35:04.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
