With that in mind, having our largest convertible debtholder submit to a lock-up agreement, was also a big move. Stopping any third party sales of this debt, means there will be an absolute reduction in the ongoing dilution that has occurred as a result of this singular noteholder.”\nWith an imminent beta launch of the Oveedia platform, the Company has endeavored to eliminate the majority of legacy debt , making way, to properly capitalize the Company in order to grow Latin America’s Central American-Caribbean online travel hub.\nSource:-Pure Hospitality Solutions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:17:53.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
