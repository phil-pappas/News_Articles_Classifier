The main purpose of Ardah is to show the beauty and strength of the Arabian camels and the riders' skills. Ardah (is) considered one of the most risky situations, since always the camels' reactions are unpredictable (and) it may get wild and jump (toward the) audience.\" Hide Caption 3 of 10 2015 National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest winners 10 photos Merit: \"A Night at Deadvlei\" by Beth McCarley – \"The night before returning to Windhoek, we spent several hours at Deadvlei\" in Namibia, McCarley said. \"The moon was bright enough to illuminate the sand dunes in the distance, but the skies were still dark enough to clearly see the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds.
