For many fans, the tournament may be their last escape of the summer, and for the players, it's the last PGA TOUR stop before the FedExCup Playoffs and seen as a must-play for those looking to win points to either qualify for or improve their standing entering the Playoffs. Earlier this year, the PGA TOUR and Wyndham Worldwide announced that Wyndham has extended its title sponsorship of the Tournament, one of the TOUR's longest-running tournaments, through 2026.\n\"It was a privilege to announce our 10-year extension as title sponsor and to continue calling the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina home of the Wyndham Championship,\" said Stephen P. Holmes , chairman and chief executive officer, Wyndham Worldwide. \"This tournament has a rich legacy, which we're honored to be a part of and take pride in what we have accomplished and will continue to build together with our partners throughout this great community.\"\nGiving Back\nAs a global hospitality leader, Wyndham Worldwide is not only committed to providing great vacation experiences for its guests, but also to serve the communities where it operates. Through its Wishes by Wyndham Foundation, the Company supports many local not-for-profit organizations each year. The Wyndham Championship is no different with philanthropy being a cornerstone of the tournament.\n\"Birdies Fore Backpacks\" supports local charitable organizations, including Backpack Beginnings, Forsyth Backpacks, Out of the Garden and United Way of Highpoint, which fill backpacks with nutritionally sound meals for low income kids and families to take home every weekend. During its inaugural run last year, \"Birdies Fore Backpacks\" raised nearly $200,000 to help feed hungry children in the Piedmont Triad region. This year, fans have the opportunity to include a donation to \"Birdies Fore Backpacks\" of $1 or more when purchasing tickets on-line at WyndhamChampionship.com, or merchandise and concessions on course.\n\"Philanthropy and the commitment to the communities in which we live and work are core values that drive our company,\" said Faith Taylor , senior vice president, corporate social responsibility, Wyndham Worldwide. \"We are proud of the positive impact the Wyndham Championship has had - from helping the Piedmont Triad Charitable Foundation's fundraising efforts to raising the tournament's visibility and elevating the on-site spectator experience through creative, experiential event activations.\"\n\"Escape to the Wyndham\"\nSince becoming the title sponsor in 2007, Wyndham Worldwide has introduced innovations that enhance the onsite spectator and social media experience, resulting in numerous recognitions by the PGA TOUR. Continuing the tradition, fans will be able to enjoy the vacation-like atmosphere and \"Escape to the Wyndham\" with activities including Passport to the Wyndham, which earns participants upgraded access, tournament tickets, and merchandise and concession discounts; a 3D Art Experience outside Margaritaville at The Wyndham allowing fans to capture themselves in a vacation-themed escape; and many opportunities to win great prizes including a 7-night stay in Puerto Rico and 25,000 Wyndham Rewards Points.\nAs a recipient of the PGA TOUR's \"Best Social Media Activation\" award, the Wyndham Championship is once again encouraging fans to get social. From seeing their tweets and posts on the 18th green scoreboard, to winning great prizes for socializing, spectators will be rewarded #AtTheWyndham. Attendees can also visit one of three twitter activated vending machines on-course and win vacation themed prizes just by tweeting with #AtTheWyndham and an activation code.
