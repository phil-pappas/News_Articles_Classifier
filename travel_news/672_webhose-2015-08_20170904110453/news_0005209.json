I have never been one who had to have designer label pocketbooks or clothes. Nor have I tried to keep up with the Joneses by buying things I didn’t need or could not afford. I was just trying to keep up with my family’s bills and keeping the budget balanced. I got there most times. However, I never seemed to have a lot of discretionary income. Whenever I managed to put some funds aside for a rainy day, thunderstorms would come… soon and all too often. \nThen, one day, the sun began to shine brightly for me—both metaphorically and literally. I suddenly had spending money. This wonderful thing happened when I moved to sunny Belize . \nDo I miss some things that are readily available in the States? Yes… at times. Do I miss paying the price for them? No, never! Do I miss seeing close friends and family on a regular basis? Most definitely. Do I miss going to my favorite stateside restaurants? Sometimes, when I’m hungry.
