Second-quarter momentum mainly came from the tertiary industry. Its share in the total industrial sector grew to 8.4pc from 7.95pc in the first quarter, partly owing to the rebound in the real estate and financial markets. Based on the contribution to cumulative year-on-year GDP growth, the secondary industry is still quite important in China’s economy, taking 37.91pc on average – from the first quarter in 2013 (41.4pc) to the second quarter this year (33.6pc). The amazing GDP growth of Xinjiang and Hainan may indicate China’s Silk Road Economic Belt strategy is actually starting to pay off Meanwhile, the financial industry contributed a lot in the first and second quarter of this year. But things will be different in the second half of 2015, because the stock market has fallen sharply since 15 June with the ensuing IPO suspension by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Among provinces that have released regional GDP growth data, 20 registered a better result in the first half-year than the first quarter, notably in western regions such as Sichuan and Xinjiang. The amazing GDP growth of Xinjiang and Hainan, with a rate higher than the national average of 7pc, may indicate China’s Silk Road Economic Belt strategy is actually starting to pay off by stimulating the country’s economic growth.
