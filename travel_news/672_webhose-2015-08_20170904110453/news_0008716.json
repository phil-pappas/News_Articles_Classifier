Some are hanging their hat on trendy restaurants and rooftop bars, but Alpha Mosaic has taken a more traditional route, focusing on quality and harnessing a slightly more sophisticated edge. Open for 12 months, it hasn't positioned itself as a go-to nightspot, which probably means it's not bathing in the same word-of-mouth glory as its neighbours. But those who've found it couldn't be happier. THE SPACE An arrangement with a nearby public pool might be, by hotel standards, a little unorthodox. But it works. As guests of the hotel, health nuts are able to go to the Valley swimming pool and gym. Others are able to indulge in an inner-city rarity – a spacious hotel room balcony overlooking the city's landmark Gateway Bridge. The lobby adjoins a seemingly under-utilised bar and restaurant area which is designed in modern greys and beige, and enlivened with stark placement of purple furniture. Large numbers on room doors are another attraction, big enough for even the thickest of spectacles to decipher. THE KIT It's tough to find a hotel in the inner-city area with enough space to stretch out, particularly a new one. Some of the showers are a hokey-cokey dance – you put your left arm in, you put your left arm out. Not this one. The open bathroom has a separate toilet and faces a robe and mini bar, removed from the main bedroom where there is a single chair, sofa and work desk. The television is mounted on the wall and can be seen from the sofa or the comfortable bed. Double curtains open to the balcony and a view which stretches to the Gateway Bridge. There's no cable television, but there is a selection of movies for A$4.95 (NZ$5.50) each. COMFORT FACTOR The only slight issue at Alpha Mosaic might be one of privacy. The hotel adjoins a block of apartments which look down on the hotel balconies, and there are offices directly opposite. But draw the curtains to a close, and all becomes cosy. Everything seems to have been designed with convenience in mind – from the spacious lobby and bar through to the rooms themselves where businesspeople won't feel like they're trapped in a cage while working away from home. Holidaymakers will appreciate the location, close to the eateries of James St, including the award-winning Gerard's Bistro. \nFOOD The hotel is geared to the business market, which means the bar and restaurant seems under-utilised on weekends. That doesn't prevent a sneaky room service chicken burger with feta, chargrilled capsicum, rocket and beer-battered fries for a reasonable $17. Breakfast is from 7am-9.30am where a basic continental spread is accompanied by an a la carte hot choice. The omelettes are generous in size and divine in flavour. If a night out is in order, James St's nighlife is a five-minute stroll down the road. \nA room with a sweeping view in the Alpha Mosaic Hotel. \nWORTH STEPPING OUT FOR \nIt's only five minutes to the revamped Brunswick Street Mall and Chinatown, so do a loop through the weekend markets and swing by James St for a spot of boutique shopping on the way back to base. \nTHE VERDICT \nThere are an increasing number of newcomers to Brisbane's inner-city hotel scene. Most are small, but this one gives you that new-car smell with plenty of legroom. Get a good weekend rate and enjoy the city. \nHOW TO GET THERE \nFrom the city, it's an easy drive through the Valley, past Constance St and right into Church St. The hotel is on your right-hand side, and there's a convenient parking bay for check-in. \nESSENTIALS \nA basic double room starts at around $169, while the executive room kicks in at about $229. There is a two-bedroom family option for around $329. It's at 12 Church St, Fortitude Valley.
