At least 120 people were injured \nThe bomb exploded on Monday close to the Erawan Shrine. It was followed by a second grenade attack on Tuesday, although no one was harmed. \nThe UK Foreign Office warned British nationals to “take extra care” in the wake of the attack, but did not alter its advice about travelling to Thailand. \nAito Agents chair and Haslemere Travel managing director Gemma Antrobus insisted the attack would likely have little impact on the UK trade, in part because household brands had not been involved. \n“When it directly hits the travelling British public, where travellers and travel companies are affected directly, then it tends to hit the headlines - the consumer press are very good at making things more dramatic,” she said.John Sullivan, head of commercial and marketing at the Advantage Travel Partnership, also said that the consortium’s members, like those at sister consortium Elite Travel Group, had not experienced any problems following the attack.” \nFor the moment it doesn’t seem to have caused any major repercussions,” he added. \nA Kuoni spokesperson said that of the 39 customers the company had in Bangkok, all were safe and had been accounted for, and the company was “monitoring the situation closely”. \nShe added: “We’ll be keeping in regular contact with customers who are in Bangkok now or due to travel imminently to make sure they are kept fully informed.” \nA Thomas Cook spokesperson said the operator had 14 Signature customers in Bangkok who would all be continuing with their trips as planned. \nMeanwhile, G Adventures also said its staff and 23 customers in Bangkok were “safe and accounted for”. \nA Tourism Authority of Thailand spokesperson said security had been stepped up. \nShe added: “The Erawan Shrine is not promoted as a tourist attraction to UK and Irish tourists. It is a sacred Hindu place that many Buddhists spend time at praying, and one of the most well-known shrines in the city, but not of cultural tourism interest to visiting Europeans.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:19:18.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
