Then they had to tell us ‘actually, she’s filming a reality show’. We couldn’t believe it,” the source said.\n“Then she comes back to work and people have been working back ‘til 7 o’clock to cover her work, and they’re p .”\nMs Dallikavak reportedly shook off a colleague’s suggestion that she “try to be a bit low key” while the dust settled.\n“At the end of the day, it’s not her fault, because management’s let her go. But people don’t like it.”\nSome colleagues expressed concern that the Westpac brand would be associated with “a show that’s objectifying women”.\n“It’s disgraceful,” a staff member told news.com.au\n“I’m here to be your Turkish delight,” banker Ebru Dallikavak tells The Bachelor.

I’m from Melbourne, and I’m here to fall in love,” she said.\n“Being a portfolio manager is quite full on ... I’ve been in the industry for seven years. I’d definitely say I’m strongly focused on my career and I do love what I do — but my love life is suffering a bit. I’ve got a lot of friends that do have partners in the same industry, but I tend not to mix business with pleasure.”\nNot just pretty faces: The Bachelor ’s new cast has career women aplenty.
