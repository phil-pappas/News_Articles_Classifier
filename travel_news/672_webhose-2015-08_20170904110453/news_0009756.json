What I love most about this city is its diversity. As a journalist, I’m constantly discovering new parts of this sprawling city and meeting people who have migrated from all over the world. On any given day, as you walk through, for example, the neighborhoods of Beyoglu on the European side, or Kadikoy on the Asian side, you see all kinds of people: fashionable conservative women wearing bright head scarves, hipsters and intellectuals. Everywhere you look there is a contradiction or juxtaposition that surprises you. For instance, during the holy month of Ramadan, I came across a group outside a mosque waiting to break their fast, just as a party boat full of apparently drunk youths passed by them. Everyone has a unique story to tell; it’s impossible to get bored. The city, however, doesn’t come without its challenges. On most days, driving feels like racing through an obstacle course and even the most patient person can easily find themselves shouting profanities out the window. That’s why I usually prefer to drive alongside the Bosporus, which runs like a sash between the European and Asian side of the city. It has a calming effect and makes the traffic that much more tolerable. Please discuss a few of the differences between the European side and the Asian side of Istanbul. I live and work on the European side of Istanbul, which can sometimes become overwhelming, as it’s the most populated side of this city of 15 million people. The European side is where you will find some of Istanbul’s signature sites: the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia, for instance. At any given opportunity I like to escape to the Asian side, which is calmer and, in many ways, the more authentic side of the city, with its strong sense of community. First and foremost, the ferry ride across is magical, and it is by far the best way to see and enjoy the architecture of the city. As the boat takes off, Istanbul’s vast landscape gradually unfolds in front of you while the sea gulls chase the boat in search of food. Kadikoy, the cultural center of the Asian side, is one of Istanbul’s most up-and-coming areas and offers an endless choice of quirky cafes, restaurants, bars and markets. If you happen to visit on a Tuesday or Friday, the Kadikoy market is the best way to embark on an adventure, with its countless stalls and entertaining vendors selling clothing, produce and spices. Locals like to interact with tourists and seem less interested in their money than people on the European side. There is also a huge sense of community in the neighborhoods, and the streets are lively with people, performers and events. The waterfront is also full of stunning restaurants, where you can enjoy Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fusion dishes while watching the fisherman on the Bosporus sail by.
