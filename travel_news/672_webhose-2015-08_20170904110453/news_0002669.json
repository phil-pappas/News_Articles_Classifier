That’s not to say that things can’t go wrong, but there’s a limit to how bad it can get, and reaching the end of the British school system is, in itself, a milestone. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android Hopefully, by this time tomorrow you will be wondering what you were ever worried about, and can turn your attention to getting prepared for the next major stage of your life, whether that be university or another route. Nonetheless, here are some last minute tips, to keep you calm and ensure tomorrow goes as smoothly as can be expected, good luck! 1. Do something to take your mind off it Let’s face it, if left to your own devices, you’re probably not going to be able to help overthinking Results Day . So instead of sitting around and clock watching this evening, try to make some plans. Meet some friends in a similar situation, go out for a meal or head to the cinema. Anything to pass the time and stop you from self destructing at home. Getting some exercise is a particularly good idea, as it will also help you sleep, and it’s likely to be the most effective at keeping your mind occupied. Exercise can help distract you Photo: Film still: Forrest Gump 2. Make sure you have alternatives ready It’s still not too late to spend a bit of time preparing in case things don’t go to plan . It’s far better to spend a couple of hours planning out some potential Clearing options and gathering contact information this evening, than in a panic tomorrow morning. Have a look at courses you’re genuinely interested in with a range of entry requirements, offered by universities who normally enter Clearing. Note down contact information for their admissions teams, their typical requirements and think of some questions you might like to ask; make sure you keep all of this to hand in the morning. Download the Telegraph Clearing app for iPhone and Android in advance too, as this will allow you to search regularly updated Clearing vacancies throughout the day. Many Russell Group universities enter Clearing and Adjustment , so you might be surprised at where a little bit of effort will get you. Doing something productive like this is a great way to stay calm, as you will feel as though you still maintain some form of control. Don’t be afraid to look at alternatives beyond university too. The hype around Results Day and the secondary education system’s focus on preparing students for university makes it hard to see any other options, and can create a fear of being left behind. Try to focus on how best to set yourself up for the long term, rather than worrying about missing out on anything in the short term. 3. Have all your details to hand Make sure you have your Ucas ID, Track login details and the contact information of both your firm and insurance choice admissions teams. If you have met your firm offer, or your Track status changes to unconditional for either one of your choices, you will not need to call anybody if you are still happy with where you've chosen. If you have missed your offer and Track hasn’t changed, it means the university are still deciding upon whether to admit you, and it would be advisable to give them a call. If they take a long time deciding, it might harm your chances in Clearing, so feel free to start calling universities to explore Clearing options just in case while they make up their mind. 4. Have a Results Day plan The day will go a lot more smoothly tomorrow if you have a plan. Ideally you should check Track before going in to get your results, as you might cause yourself unnecessary panic if you have missed your offer but have been accepted anyway. Set a time in the morning to check Track - it goes live at 8am - sort out how you’re getting in to school (and with whom) and have some potential celebratory options lined up for afterwards. Decide where you will head to start making Clearing phone calls if you need to, and if possible make sure there’s someone on hand for you to talk to for reassurance. 5. Your results are out of your control If you have a plan for the day, have done your research in case things don’t go your way and have all the necessary details ready, there’s nothing more you can do. Checking unofficial mark schemes and agonising over how you think you have done, will do you no good whatsoever. The results may be out of your control, but it's completely up to you to shape what happens afterwards. Focus on how you can make the best of whatever situation you might find yourself in, and not on what the results themselves might be. Accept that there's nothing you can do now Photo: Reuters/Nasa 6. Eat and sleep This might sound incredibly patronising but don’t forget to eat, it will do your anxiety no good to forgo food. If you’re at the point where you feel too nervous to eat then you need to take a step back and try to calm yourself down. Cut off contact for a bit with friends talking about results - who might be making you feel worse - put some music on and try to clear your head. Although you might not think it will be possible, or have made plans to stay up all night, sleep is an absolute necessity before Results Day. The likelihood is that you will have made your offer, and will be heading off to university, but celebrating is going to be difficult if you would rather lie down in the corner than get a round in. Conversely, if your results aren’t as hoped and you need to start making phone calls, you will want to be at your best, not resembling something out of The Walking Dead. 7. Enjoy it Most of all, enjoy tomorrow. The build up might be panicky, but opening up that envelope (unless your school has moved online) and seeing the grades you had been hoping for is something you’ll always remember. Even if you don’t do as well as hoped, being done with school for good and figuring out where you will be heading next is a massively satisfying step. Results Day should be a memorable day Photo: Paul Grover You only get your results once, and if you receive a university place then don’t bother wondering if you could have done better, head out and celebrate, tell your entire extended family and go annoy everybody on Facebook. You earned it!
