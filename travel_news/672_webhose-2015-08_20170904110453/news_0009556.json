Sending in the nomination was Linda Ching, an incredible photographer based in Hawaii, with over 10 books to her credit. She has traveled and shot photos from around the world, and says one of her favorite places is Villa Bodhi, and is definitely worthy of being included on THE LIST. \neTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said of the nomination: “Although I have not yet had the pleasure to visit Villa Bodhi myself, I know that Ubud is a special mystical place. It’s a small town with a soul, and Villa Bodhi represents this soul. I am told that a visit to this special property begins with a welcome drink brewed from fresh hibiscus blossoms, local rice delicacies sprinkled with fresh coconut shavings sweetened with palm sugar, and a cool towel. A full staff magically responds to every desire with simple kindness. How could one not fall in love with a place like this?” \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \n“Villa Bodhi literally started with a dream. I got up from slumber in Hawaii one day and said ‘Bali,’ and in 2 weeks I was there. I bought an antique door that was too big to ship, so I built around it, and Villa Bodhi appeared. Bali feels like old Hawaii - a place where you can feel the silence between the heartbeats,” said owner Amos Kotomori. “I am proud Villa Bodhi was added to THE LIST. To receive an award from a global publication is a great recognition of the work we do and believe in every day. It is truly an honor to be included with all the other giants in the industry. We are a humble place and love what we do. To be recognized for this is amazing,” Amos added. \nVilla Bodhi consists of 4 cottages. Each is unique in its own way, and all are wheelchair accessible. Each bedroom provides air conditioning and a fan, room safe, refrigerator, Wi-Fi, and local amenities. Recreational activities include yoga, massage, country bike rides, hiking, ethnic music, dance lessons, and tours designed to fit guests’ personal taste. \nVilla Bodhi's staff provides the best of care and attention to guests’ individual needs, and included with a stay at this villa is a salt water infinity pool, dream beds with luxurious 1,000-thread-count sheets, herbs from an organic garden used to prepare meals, as well as airport transfer and a car park. Villa Bodhi, is located just 7 kilometers from Ubud, and is specially designed for family, leisure, and business travel. It is an ideal place to create happy memories and special ceremonies. \nTo make a nomination for THE LIST, go to honesttravelawards.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:37:14.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
