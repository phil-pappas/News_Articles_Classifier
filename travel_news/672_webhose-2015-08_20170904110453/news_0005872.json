But there are situations where it is not the best form of communication. To get the response you need, you must choose the right medium.\nTo determine whether it is more effective to instant message someone, send an e-mail, pick up the phone or schedule a meeting, ask two questions:\n1. What is the nature of the subject? Is it specific and purely informational? Or is it complex, sensitive and nuanced?\n2. What type of response do you need? Are you asking a quick \"yes or no\" question, or are you looking for a more detailed answer?\nOnce you answer these two questions, the next step is crafting your message in a way that efficiently cues up context and a response. Consider these tips:\n1. Give context . You often need to bring people up to speed on the who, what, where, when and why upfront. As opposed to writing, speaking gives you more room to do this.\n2. Stick to three questions or less . This especially applies to instant messaging. If you have more than two follow-up questions, you probably want to pick up the phone.\n3. Calls can be easier . When you have a lot to say or are dealing with a sensitive topic, a quick chat on the phone or in person is more ideal than e-mailing back and forth. If you are engaging many different people, that is when you want to schedule a more structured meeting or conference call.\n4. Give people enough time to prepare . Be sure that people have been able to think through a thorough response — and have time to talk. If someone is on deadline or about to meet a client, you are better off postponing your conversation.\nBeing able to get your point across most effectively is increasingly necessary in today’s workplace. Remember, when it comes to business writing, you are in charge of getting the response you need from people. If you make it as convenient as possible for them to give it to you, everyone wins.\nAdapted from \"What e-mail, IM, and the phone are each good for\" at HBR.org .)\n© 2015 Harvard Business School Publishing Corp", "external_links": ["https://hbr.org/"], "published": "2015-08-03T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:18:32.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
