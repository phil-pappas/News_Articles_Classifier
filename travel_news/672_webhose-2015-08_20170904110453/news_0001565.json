Please be aware. We don't take any responsibility for this action\".\n© Provided by AFP It is forbidden to kill seagulls, so the only way to fight them is to destroy their eggs or release birds of prey to hunt them\n- 'Never been so bad' -\nLocal witnesses described a common plan of attack used by the birds, whereby a lone assailant pounces on an unsuspecting diner, forcing them to drop their food. At this point, hordes of reinforcements arrive to feast on the spilt remains.\n\"They'll eat everything except lemon and tabasco,\" one added.\n\"I see gulls grabbing food from people three or four times a day, more when it's sunny,\" said Chris, who works at a fish-and-chip kiosk on Brighton pier.\n\"The worst thing I've seen is one landing on the head of an old lady who had a hot dog. She obviously dropped it and the same gull took it away really fast, the woman was terrified,\" he told AFP.\n\"It's never been as bad. This is the worst year,\" said Jack Messenger, from the Sea Haze Bar, another beachfront restaurant.\n\"It's probably best for us, because when the seagulls eat their food, they (the customers) come and get more,\" he joked.\nIt is not only seaside towns that are suffering, with inland cities such as Bath and Bristol reporting problems.\nExperts blame a combination of factors for this summer's Hitchcockian events.\nThey include gulls becoming more accustomed to living close to humans and the birds being particularly aggressive in July when they have young in their nests.\nThree pets have been pecked to death by seagulls in southwest England in recent months: a turtle, a chihuahua and a Yorkshire Terrier.\n\"Blood was coming out of his head. It was like a murder scene,\" the Yorkshire Terrier's owner Emma Vincent told reporters.\n- Hysteria 'not justified' -\nEven Prime Minister David Cameron has swooped into the debate.\n\"I think a big conversation needs to happen,\" he said.\n\"Reading the papers this morning about how aggressive the seagulls are now in St Ives, for instance, we do have a problem.\"\nIt is forbidden to kill seagulls, so the only way to fight them is to destroy their eggs or release birds of prey to hunt them.\nTony Whitehead, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said he \"didn't think the hysteria is justified\".\n\"There is an issue... but to demonise the whole species off the back of a few incidents, I don't agree with that,\" he told AFP.\nPete Rock, an expert on urban gulls, called for further study using advanced technologies instead of destroying their eggs.\n\"They know everything there is to know about their home range, where all the food is, and where to go and mate,\" he told AFP.\n\"What we don't know, is what they know, and the only way to find that out is to use satellite telemetry.\"\nLaura Mayes, a councillor in southwest England, highlighted another problem encountered with nesting gulls.\n\"What has really affected us is noise. They fly over the houses of the neighbours crying 24 hours,\" she said.\n\"No way we would allow neighbours to have parties all night, but that's exactly what it means to have gulls living near people.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://api.grindnetworks.com/api/v1/msn/?feed=13&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=0&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1Prxu.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Just", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/AAbQchV.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelnews&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&qu", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAbYB02.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Raccoon", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/AAbRavu.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA6s9ye&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;When", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UON9.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Seagull", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/AAbRvvL.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAnvH2&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;By"], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T07:53:35.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
