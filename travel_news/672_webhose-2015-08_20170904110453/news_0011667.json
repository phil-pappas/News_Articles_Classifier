With immediate effect, passengers can now book and travel throughout the combined networks of both airlines, and enjoy convenient flight connections between India and South Africa, over Jet Airways’ Abu Dhabi gateway.\nThrough the codeshare arrangement, South African Airways will place its “SA” marketing code on Jet Airways’ services between Abu Dhabi and Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.\nIn turn, Jet Airways will place its marketing code on South African Airways’ flights from Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg and beyond to Cape Town and Durban.\nTickets went on sale on 4 August 2015, with travel effective from 13 August 2015.\nMr Sylvain Bosc, SAA Chief Commercial Officer, says: “This partnership enforces the historic commercial, political, and cultural co-operation between South Africa and India, leveraging on SAA’s daily services between Johannesburg and Abu Dhabi.”\n“There is substantial potential for trade growth between our two countries and our planned partnership aims to facilitate that growth. Through this agreement, SAA aims to greatly enhance the availability of affordable fares to help develop the growth of tourism from India into Southern Africa.”\n“The codeshare agreement will effectively enhance flight choices for customers, whether originating in India or Africa, thus truly bringing the world to Africa and taking Africa to the world.”\nMr. Raj Sivakumar, Chief Commercial Officer, Jet Airways, said: “We are delighted to expand our codeshare with South African Airways, enabling guests to enjoy seamless connectivity to several destinations in India and South Africa via Abu Dhabi. This enhanced partnership is a further demonstration of Jet Airways’ strong network that offers an unmatched connectivity between India and the rest of the world.\n“We are confident that our partnership with South African Airways will further stimulate business and tourism between India and South Africa.” Mr Sivakumar added.\n“SAA will continue to focus on partnerships. No airline is able to service every route with its own aircraft and, through effective partnerships and code-sharing, SAA’s reach will continue to grow, as was the case with our expanded middle-Eastern operations adding 26 additional destinations and source-markets to the SAA network.” Mr. Bosc asserted.\nSource:- South African Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:20:26.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
