Plus, for every delicacy there is a local wine to match. What’s more, amazing scenery greets you around every corner on your travels through the country and you are never far from a fabulous place to stay. If food and wine tourism were an Olympic sport, the Aussies would give even France and Italy a run for their money. Go wild out west In decades past, Aussie farmers were known for starting and ending the day on a steak, and while meat has lost none of its appeal, Australia’s menu of wild meats now goes beyond native kangaroos and wallabies to include boar, hare, deer, goat and rabbit. Western Australia’s Bushtucker River and Winery Tours is renowned for hosting wild food luncheons in the wineries of Margaret River, 170 miles south of Perth. Gourmet meats include marinated emu, slow-roasted kangaroo and grilled crocodile. You may even sample Australia’s infamous witchetty grubs along with unique seasonal condiments and sauces such as a pesto of macadamia, bush tomato and native pepper or a wild chilli and jackfruit sambal. While these fabulous lunches are a highlight, winery visits, tastings and breath-taking scenery are all part of the package. Margaret River, although small, grows a disproportionate number of Australia’s finest award-winning wines and the wider region boasts splendid beaches and remarkable ancient forests. A typical Bushtucker Tour takes in wineries such as Wise Wines on Eagle Bay, pioneering Cullen in Margaret River and lunch at the Vasse Felix estate. As well as tasting dozens of premium wines, guests get to sample local cheeses, chocolate and specialty beers. Tours depart from Bussleton, Dunsborough and Margaret River and tickets are all-inclusive. South Australia’s seafood trail With more than 22,000 miles of coastline, Australia is a rich source of seafood and the Eyre Peninsula, has long been regarded as the country’s seafood frontier. The pristine waters of Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight are home to countless cold- water delicacies which local fishermen and restaurateurs love to showcase to visitors. The Eyre Peninsula Seafood Trail links the finest seafood restaurants, boat charter and tour companies, fish farms and oyster beds from Ceduna on the Nullarbor Plain to Whyalla northwest of Adelaide. Hire a car or join an organised tour of some of the world-leading aquaculture farms and century-old fishing ports. See where barramundi and the threatened Murray cod are now farmed in Whyalla. Hand pick fresh crayfish in Elliston; feast on freshly-caught whiting, green-lipped abalone and blue swimmer crabs in Streaky Bay and Ceduna; or take the bluefin tuna cruise around Boston Bay. Aside from offering a memorable seafood adventure, The Eyre Peninsula has all the facilities for a summer holiday. White sandy beaches, a bracing ocean, comfortable lodgings and, not least, a great Aussie welcome. A capital food and wine destination A few decades ago Australia’s capital city Canberra was synonymous only with its Federal Parliament and the surrounding region with wool and cattle. It was of no more than passing interest to Sydneysiders racing to the Snowy Mountains for a winter break. How things have changed. As cool, fine wine regions such as Hilltops and Tumbarumba have come to the fore, an entourage of artists, chefs, galleries and rural retreats has followed suit and turned the Canberra district into a truly sought-after holiday destination. Finding your way around is easy thanks to the well organised tourist trail, known as The Poacher’s Way . Among its rarer attractions are French black truffles, grown on the outskirts of the city. With her truffle dog Snuffles, Sherry McArdle-English supplies local restaurants and runs truffle hunts and cooking classes with chef Andrew Haskins. Find out more at canberratruffles.com . Thirty minutes north of Canberra you find the vibrant village of Murrumbateman. Its boutique wineries include Shaw Estate Vineyard , where you can taste award-winning wines and enjoy Jai Dawson’s stylish cooking in smart yet informal surroundings. Don’t leave town without sampling Robyn Rowe Chocolates, flavoured with local produce such as honey and Clonakilla Muscat. A short drive away is Gundaroo with its quaint 19th-century colonial architecture and the sophisticated charms of the Capital Wines Epicurean Centre. Here, Jennie and Mark Moonie specialise in matching delicious morsels of the best regional produce with award winning local wines. Nearby, the historic town of Hall boasts one of Australia’s top smoke houses, The Poacher’s Pantry , and the unique range of smoked meats is sold to many of Australia’s leading restaurants. Grab a bite at the Smokehouse Café. A standout dish on the brunch menu is chef Marcel’s 62° hen’s egg, field mushrooms, Poacher’s bacon and spring onions with béarnaise sauce. Island life Tasmania shouts as loudly as the Aussie mainland. And rightly so. Fabulous cool-climate wines, internationally acclaimed whiskies, gourmet produce, World Heritage wilderness and a fascinating modern art scene are just some of the island’s assets. In the bountiful north-west alone, 20 or so of the best businesses line the Cradle to Coast Tasting Trail and extend a warm welcome to visitors from near and far. Accommodation ranges from the stunning lakeside setting of the Cradle Mountain Hotel to gracious federation-style digs at Alexandria Bed and Breakfast on the banks of the Inglis River. One of Tasmania’s quaintest boutique wineries sits on a hilltop overlooking the seaside town of Penguin. Blue Penguin is carbon-neutral and specialises in small batches of hand-crafted, cool-climate wines. It’s well worth a detour. With this and so many other tempting wineries en route, you may think twice about driving the trail. Cradle Coast Tours offers pre-arranged and bespoke itineraries with knowledgeable local guides. Alternatively, visit The Angel’s Share, in the historic port town of Stanley, to sample and buy finest Tasmanian whiskies and wines. While you are there, eat at the award-winning Old Cable Station restaurant and savour excellent local and seasonal produce such as cured fallow deer, wood oven-roasted Stanley crayfish or tea-smoked ocean trout.
