But its beauty pales to almost insignificance when we get on the ground of this very diverse 10,400-kilometre-square island that has two active volcanoes, incredible snorkelling, manta rays, turtles and other sea life, and, perhaps most importantly, is home to people who truly embrace the spirit of aloha. \nWe're greeted with shell leis at Kona Airport, a cruisy, rather laid-back affair. Our check-in at the Sheraton Kona Resort and Spa is followed by a tour of the spacious, history-stacked grounds, and it's time to get ready for our evening snorkel with the manta rays. \nAs much as I am looking forward to it, I am terrified, but the other four divers heading out with Captain Jeff and Alexis on the traditional double-hull waka Wa'a Kini Kini are bubbling with excitement. Diana Dobson \nThe active vent within the Halema'uma'u Crater in the Kilauea volcano. \nIt's surreal as we drop into the dark water right in front of the Sheraton – guests at the aptly named Rays on the Bay restaurant and bar are crowding the balustrades to also see the manta rays. We drift in our snorkel gear, in around 15 metres of water, our eyes peeled for any movement from the depths. It's quiet until a squeal from one of our group – unfortunately it was me – as a giant comes swooping up towards us like something from outer space, and does a graceful arc within centimetres of me. \nThree more join the dance and it continues for 40 or so minutes as these gentle giants – some up to 6m from wing tip to wing tip – feed on the plankton. They come right at us with gaping mouths wide open, and arcing back at the last millisecond. It's terrifying and thrilling all in the same breath. \nAlexis' passion for these sea giants is palpable. The sea-nymph-like eco-warrior encourages her divers to \"manta fest the manta rays\" . . . and it seems she may be right. \"They pick up on our energy and frequency levels and feel everything,\" she says. Diana Dobson \nA carver at Pu'uhonua o Honaunau, a sacred place on the southern Kona coast. \nEach manta ray is identified by its fingerprint-like spots, and they're named – there's Rightie and Leftie, so named for their damaged fins, probably by boat propellers, and Big Bertha, the largest, weighing in at an estimated 500-plus kilograms. Alexis says the worst that can happen is a \"big smushy hug\". There are 250 recorded manta along the Kona coastline, between Keauhou Bay and the airport, and they're fiercely protected. \nWe are greeted back on board with a hot cocoa. Everyone is buzzing, and appreciative of just how special an experience they've had. \nEverywhere you look on Hawai'i there is evidence of lava flow. It's a compelling sight and one can only imagine what it must have been like when it was actually flowing. Diana Dobson \nFishing for big tuna and cliff jumping are popular pastimes at South Point, the southernmost spot in the United States. \nWith that in mind, we hire a car and head to the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. The last eruption on the island was in 2008, but in April 2015, the lava lake rose to record highs and overflowed onto the crater floor. There is a lot going on up at the park, and it is best spread over two days, but can be done in one if you are there first thing. The day needs to be planned around being at the Jaggar Museum just before sundown so you can watch the live Kilauea Volcano. The active vent is within the Halema'uma'u Crater in the caldera of Kilauea. As dark descends, the glow gets brighter and brighter and although we willed it to bubble to the top for a real display, none was forthcoming. Ad Feedback \nDuring daylight, hike through native rainforest – very similar to New Zealand bush – into a crater and hike across the hardened lava lake that is still steaming from the 1959 eruption. It's a 6.4km loop, but you can also just wander into the middle of the crater to get a feel for the enormity of your surrounds. Another must is a walk through the 500-year-old Thurston Lava Tube. \nWhile you have that rental car, make the most of this island. There are diving spots all around it – we started at the Sheraton and headed down the coast. First stop Kealakekua Bay where the Captain Cook Monument is. Fantastic snorkelling and if you are lucky, you will see dolphins there. Diana Dobson \nTurtles love the black sand of Punalu'u Beach. \nA little further along is the historic Pu'uhonua o Honaunau village, with more good snorkelling nearby. The black sands of Punalu'u Beach are where you'll find plenty of turtles – both hawksbill and green sea – just hanging out. South Point is a must. Thrill-seekers jump off the cliffs into the water, right beside locals fishing for big tuna. It's heart-stopping stuff at the southernmost tip of the United States. \nThe Green Sand Beach (Papakolea Beach) is next – and it is actually olive-coloured sand, thanks to the mineral olivine. Unless you have a sturdy four-wheel drive, you need to catch a local shuttle out to the beach itself for $15, or walk the 6km round trip. \nAt 4205m above sea level, Mauna Kea is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Some say it is the highest mountain in the world because if measured from its base on the sea floor, it would be 10,000m tall. The temperature drops rapidly as we climb up to the visitor centre at 2800m. It is as high as we can go in our rental car. Mauna Kea is said to be one of the only places on earth where you can drive from sea level to over 4000m inside of two hours. The views are stunning, but we disappear into the clouds before we get to the centre. Diana Dobson \nSampling the goods at Kona Brewing Company. \nMauna Kea is also considered one of the most important land-based astronomy sites in the world, and there are a couple of very powerful telescopes at the centre to look through. \nWith so much local produce – both edible and drinkable – we do a Kona Coffee, Chocolate and Beer Tour with Hawaii Forest and Trail. Tour leader Danny chats constantly, giving us an in-depth but casual history lesson as we drive up into the mountains. \nHawaii is a unique state, as the only part of the United States that had monarchy. Geologically speaking, the island of Hawai'i is the youngest in the chain at \"just\" 700,000 years old. \nOur first stop is the family-owned Greenwell Coffee Farms. The farms' legacy was started in 1850 by shipping entrepreneur Henry Nicholas Greenwell, and today is run by his fourth-generation descendants. Kona coffee is akin to Champagne, in that it has to be produced in a certain area to use the branding. Some of the trees at the Greenwell Coffee Farms are more than 100 years old, and all of the beans hand-picked. We try a range of delectable coffees after the farm tour. \nNext we hit the Donkey Balls Factory – the tongue-in-cheek family operation of Lisa and Karl Ellis that uses up to 4500kg of locally grown macadamia nuts in its sweet production, featuring up to 80 different chocolate treats. \nAnd finally, it's to the Kona Brewing Company with its locally inspired beers including the Longboard Lager, Big Wave Golden Ale and Wailua Wheat, among many others. \nDanny figures if the island gets cut off from the rest of the world, all would be fine, thanks to all the organic produce, fresh water and beer readily available. \nAs the sun sets on another perfect day, we head back to Rays on the Bay at the Sheraton to sip our craft beer and cocktails, dine on gorgeous local produce, listen to some Kiwi-inspired live music and watch the manta rays on our last night. \nIt's a time to reflect on how special this island and its people truly are. \nGETTING THERE Fly to the Big Island with Hawaiian Airlines, which offers multiple 45-minute-ish flights a day between Honolulu and either Kona or Hilo. hawaiianairlines.com \nSTAYING THERE The Sheraton Kona Resort and Spa at Keauhou Bay has gorgeous locally inspired food and spacious rooms with fantastic views. sheratonkona.com . \nGETTING AROUND Hire a car from Hertz – John Poggensee runs the agency from right in the lobby of the Sheraton – and head off to the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. nps.gov/state/hi/index.htm \nBEING THERE Dive at night with the manta rays with Eka Canoe Adventures from a traditional double-hull waka. ekacanoeadventures.com Take a Kona Coffee, Chocolate and Beer Tour with Hawaii Forest and Trail. hawaii-forest.com - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T12:54:42.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
