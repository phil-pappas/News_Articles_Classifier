Trump is expected to make news in the travel industry following his appearance in tonight’s presidential debate. \nThe top spot at the Trump Hotel Collection has been vacant since Jim Petrus left earlier this year to lead St. Regis Hotels & Resorts, one of Starwood Hotels & Resorts’ luxury brands. Trump officials were not available for comment. \nDanziger most recently served as president and CEO of Hampshire Hotels Management, LLC. He began his career in hospitality more than 40 years ago at The Fairmont San Francisco, according to his bio on the website. His previous experience includes CEO-level roles at Starwood, Wyndham Hotel Group and Carlson Hotels Worldwide. \nHe joins Trump's luxury portfolio at a challenging time. \nWhile Trump has surged to a leadership position in most polls, an exclusive Travel Market Report survey with over 600 travel agents showed more than a third of advisors said their clients expressed concerns about staying in the billionaire's namesake properties. \nAt the same time agents said their focus remained on fulfilling the needs of their clients. \nA public announcement of Danziger's appointment is expected on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:56:02.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
