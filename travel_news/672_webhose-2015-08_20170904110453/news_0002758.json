Leicestershire Police faced outright ridicule earlier this week when it emerged officers will only probe break-ins at properties with even door numbers, while failing to turn out for identical crimes at homes with odd numbers. A burglary in action Photo: ALAMY Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the country’s most senior police officer, waded into the debate by revealing he disagreed with police chiefs who refused to investigate house burglaries, and pledged his officers will continue to look into all such crimes. • Opinion: Failing to investigate burglary won't solve anything, says police commissioner In a further development, the policing watchdog who oversees the force in David Cameron’s constituency said ignoring house thefts would lead to spiralling crime. Apart from Leicestershire’s trial burglary scheme, another police force has introduced a policy which allows officers to discontinue investigations into criminal damage, minor assaults and lower-value thefts. Merseyside’s “police discretion framework”, introduced last year, was described as a “common sense approach” to allow frontline officers to drop investigations which are “not in the public interest”.

Hampshire police told Gary Badnell, from Cosham, they would not pursue his case after he reported his parked Vauxhall Astra estate had been written off late at night in a hit-and-run crash. Despite turning detective and tracking down CCTV footage of the incident Mr Badnell, 33, was told the investigation would not be taken any further. “A decision was made that as this was a minor damage, no-injury road traffic incident reported some time after the fact, no further action will be taken as there is a very low likelihood of sufficient evidence being available to secure a successful prosecution,” a spokesman said after the incident in April. Sir Bernard, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said in a radio interview with LBC: “I don’t agree with the chiefs who’ve said that they’re not going to investigate burglary. “So, as far as I’m concerned, while I’m in charge of the Met, we will be attending and investigating burglaries. “It’s a serious crime. If somebody breaks into your home I regard that as serious.” He added: “I don’t really understand the logic behind it because I’ve not examined it enough, so obviously I’m sure they will have made a decision based on some reasoning, but it’s not one that I would follow in London.” There were further signs of police infighting last night as David Cameron's local police watchdog said the controversial even-numbers only policy would only lead to more break-ins and, ultimately, even more serious crime. Writing exclusively for The Telegraph Anthony Stansfeld, the commissioner for the Prime Minister’s local force, Thames Valley, said: “If minor burglary is not investigated then the crime will be repeated, until eventually the perpetrator commits one of such seriousness that it has to be investigated. “The number of household burglaries will escalate until whole urban areas become prey to crime, and a breeding ground of other serious crime. “A household burglary is not a minor crime, even though what has been stolen may not be of any value. The scales of justice Photo: GEOFF PUGH “It is a huge invasion of privacy and leaves the victim frightened and intimidated, and leaves a feeling of insecurity for many years. For older people it can be devastating.” His force had managed to reduce the crime to a 42-year low by” taking every household burglary seriously”, he added. “We need to look after all victims, but we also need to have fewer victims. “Getting this balance right is never going to be easy, but failing to take household burglary seriously is not going to solve anything,” said the commissioner. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:27:48.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
