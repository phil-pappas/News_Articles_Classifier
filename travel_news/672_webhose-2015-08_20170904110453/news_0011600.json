It seems we've gotten the point where even our leisure time involves a serious amount of multi-tasking.\nSitting by the pool and relaxing while on vacation, or lying on the beach and mentally checking out, became passé many years ago. Travelers are increasingly searching for meaningful experiences involving not just fun or relaxation, but also hyper-localized opportunities that include learning a local skill or trade, participating in cultural activities or gaining behind-the-scenes exposure to a country and its traditions.\nIn fact, according to the 2015 Resonance Report, which studies travel trends, the consumption of experiences (rather than the purchasing of old-fashioned material goods) has become a new way of signaling social status.\nThink of it as Vacation 3.0, where the hot commodity is interaction with intangible heritage such as traditions, storytelling and higher levels of cultural participation rather then passive observation.\nThis increasingly popular trend began a few years ago and is growing more sophisticated with each passing day, as hotels and resorts around the world seize on the desire among travelers to have more authentic or unique opportunities. Experiences once limited to the adventurous or the backpackers are now permeating the masses.\n© Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images A Mexican man in pre-hispanic Aztec costume play the ball during a traditional \"Juego de Pelota\" (in Spanish) at the Xcaret eco-park in Xcaret, Mexico on June 5 2009. Called by the Maya \"pok-ta-pok\" and for the Aztecs \"tlachtli\", it is a former Indo-American game of ball which practice goes back to approximately 3.500 years in the past and has been considered to be a precedent of the football. AFP PHOTO/Luis Acosta (Photo credit should read LUIS ACOSTA/AFP/Getty Images) Sandos Caracol Eco Resort , for example, in Playa del Carmen, offers more than 80 activities each week as part of what it calls the Xcalacoco Experience, or activities designed specifically to expose travelers to Mayan culture and traditions.\nThe offerings range from Mayan cooking demonstrations to ancient Mayan ball games. Each day of the week at the resort is dedicated to one element of Mayan life. One day is focused on corn, another on water, and yet another day on fire, and so on.\n\"In this region where our property is based, there was a Mayan settlement,\" says Vanessa Goig, marketing manager for the property. \"The area was called Xcalacoco. So we took the opportunity to start thinking about how to teach our guests more about local traditions, culture and nature. More and more people are interested in knowing more about the places they are traveling.\"\nOne of the most recent additions to the resort's educational and cultural lineup is Path of Senses, a sensorial activity that puts groups in touch with nature by leading them blindfolded and barefoot through the jungle.\n\"It's like a journey through the senses, so you can experience nature from the Mayan point of view,\" says Goig. \"We take them by the hand, they don't see anything, and they are led on a path through the middle of jungle, in one of the isolated areas of the resort, where there are no buildings. The path is made with different materials, and because people are barefoot they can feel things on their feet. During the experience the guide also has them feel different objects, and smell different things.\"\nAccording to the Resonance Report, the portion of American travelers interested in learning new things has increased to 94%. Meanwhile, hotels have seen as much as a 10% increase in local programming in order to accommodate that growing demand.\nMillennials in particular, says the report, are interested in experiencing everyday life in another country and increasing their knowledge.\nAll of which has led to multitasking vacationers.\n\"I think people are combining a lot of things because they are so busy,\" says Melissa Paston, catering sales manager at New York City's Kitano Hotel. \"If they're traveling, they want leisure and they want education at same time. They are multitasking leisure. People are looking for unique experiences. A hotel is not just about a place to sleep anymore, but is also about having a transporting experience.\"\nWith that in mind, here's a look at some of the localized experiences emerging in 2015.\n1. Miami Graffiti Experience, Marriott Stanton South Beach\n© Alan Diaz/AP Photo An unidentified person walks by a mural in the Wynwood area of Miami, Sunday, Nov. 4, 2012. Wynwwod, a neighborhood in downtown Miami, is known for its graffiti and street art genre. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz) Adding some color to the vacation itinerary, literally, the Marriott Stanton South Beach has teamed up with a local artist to offer graffiti lessons.\nGuests are given a chance to vandalize the hotel's walls during the lessons -- at least a small portion of the walls. The spray painting takes place on a wall that's shielding a large renovation project at the hotel. Allowing the space to be used for art lessons was a way of doing something more innovative than simply hanging a sign saying \"Excuse our appearance during renovations,\" according to hotel officials.\nInstead guests are provided with a hands-on experience working alongside the artist Atomik, whose signature orange character can be found all around the city.\nThe lessons, which last about an hour, cover the basics of forming shapes, patterns, gradients and the tricks to painting names. The classes are available upon request and are open to all ages. The cost is $170 per person.\n2. Japanese Tea Ceremony, The Kitano Hotel, New York City\n© Photographer's Choice/Getty Images Japanese tea ceremony Making a cup of tea is pretty straightforward right? Boil water. Add tea.\nActually, the answer to that question depends on whom you're talking to, because in Japan, and other Asian countries, making a cup of tea can be an art form unto itself.\nWhile many in Asian countries still grab tea on the go like the rest of us, the traditional tea ceremony is an elaborate and refined ceremony meant to demonstrate grace and good etiquette. Its roots trace back thousands of years and are tied to Zen Buddhism.\nIf you happen to be in New York City or visiting there, The Kitano (the city's only Japanese-owned hotel) offers the opportunity to take part in a tea ceremony class, giving travelers and locals an immersion in this unique tradition.\nNew York City resident John Frazier participated in a class as a way of understanding his partner's culture just a little bit better.\n\"Everything is done in traditional Japanese attire, and the tea master is basically walking on his knees,\" recalls Frazier. \"Everybody participating is sitting on the floor, and the tea master opens the shoji screen, bows, and bows again and comes into the room. There is a simple, elegant lineup of tea materials and there were a number of vessels that we drank tea from.\"\nThose are just a few of the highlights from the ceremony that Frazier recalled. The entire event, he says, was meditative and spiritual.\n\"It's very much focused on being in the moment and being in the experience and honoring the cup you are drinking out of and smelling the aroma of the tea before you drink it,\" he explains.\nWill Frazier incorporate tea ceremonies into his daily life? Probably not. But the experience, he says, taught him to be more mindful and more present in each moment.\n\"And that's a good lesson to learn over and over,\" adds the busy executive.\nClasses cost about $100 and also include a meal at the hotel's unique Japanese restaurant. Contact the hotel directly for more details.\n3. Foraging Adventures, Firelight Camps at La Tourelle Resort & Spa\n© Oxford Scientific/Getty Images Garlic Mustard--a serious invasive weed Connecting with nature and gathering food the way Native Americans did is yet another unique learning experience being offered to travelers these days.\nIn this case the opportunity is available at the Finger Lakes glamping site Firelight Camps, where groups are taken on foraging adventures and then indulge in a feast created by Food Network star Emma Frisch.\nThe wildly popular 90-minute foraging hike teaches participants to identify items that could be used as food or medicinally.\n\"A lot of people show up thinking they're going to fill a basket with tons of food, but it's about learning to identify things,\" says Frisch. \"We don't actually collect things and bring them back, unless it's something really prolific. It's more about seeing forest food as a seasoning or a trail snack, something small and light.\"\nAfter the hike however, Frisch prepares a meal that incorporates some foraged items. Recent menus have included garlic mustard pesto pasta using foraged garlic mustard and hemlock peach iced tea made with freshly gathered hemlock.\n\"People are really looking for a more authentic way of traveling and being able to connect with the natural environment and with local food is the ultimate way of doing that,\" says Frisch. \"People are less interested in tourist attractions and more interested in the insider knowledge and the experiences that the local would have.\"\nThe cost of the foraging hike is $20.\n4. Crafting Time in Geneva, InterContinental Hotel\n© Tony Hutchings/Getty Images Inside of 1930s Swiss Pocket Watch There are few things more synonymous with Geneva than the art of watch making. This fact has not gone unnoticed by executives at the InterContinental Hotels & Resorts. The high-end hotel chain recently announced five new additions to its collection of \"Insider Experiences,\" including such things as watch making in Geneva and goldsmithing in Greece.\nThe experience in Geneva allows hotel guests to explore the craft by visiting with some of the industry's living legends, touring their studios and experimenting themselves with watch making.\nHotel guests at the InterContinental Athenaeum Athens meanwhile are invited to experience the secrets behind the country's most treasured, ancient jewels with celebrated, local jewelry designer Ilias Lalounis. The offering also allows guests to try their hand at silver and goldsmithing.\nPrices for these activities range from about $2,200 to $5,000.\n5. Ukulele Lessons, Hilton Hawaiian Village\n© iStockphoto/Getty Images playing Ukulele Yes, Hawaii may be the ultimate beach destination, but there are plenty of cultural and educational activities to be taken in here as well. For the musically inclined, there's the opportunity to learn how to play one of Hawaii's earliest musical instruments - the ukulele.\nAt Hilton Hawaiian Village, Taylor Pave, an island resident, gives one-hour lessons that offer visitors exposure to one small slice of Hawaiian life.\n\"We want to provide our guests with a taste of Hawaiian culture,\" says Pave. \"Usually people coming to Hawaii are looking for that. The ukulele is one of our traditions here.\"\nGuests of any age are invited to participate in the lessons. In Hawaii the instrument is taught to children beginning in kindergarten, says Pave. If music is not your thing, the resort also offers lei-making lessons and hula lessons.\n\"I think travelers want to get more of a worldly experience and expand their cultural knowledge,\" says Pave. \"Instead of just hanging out by the pool they want to get a real feel of what Hawaii is all about.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NGM.img&description=Ukelele+-+iStockphoto%2fGetty+Images", "http://www.kitano.com/", "http://www.sandos.com/hotel-sandos-caracol-in-playa-del-carmen.htm", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NF2.img&description=Japanese+tea+ceremony+-+Photographer%27s+Choice%2fGetty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NFD.img&description=Garlic+mustard+-+Oxford+Scientific%2fGetty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NCP.img&description=Making+leis+in+hawaii+-+Greg+Elms%2fGetty+Images", "http://www.firelightcamps.com/#an-elevated-camping-experience", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NEh.img&description=Miami+graffiti+-+Alan+Diaz%2fAP+Photo", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5NGk.img&description=Swiss+watch+-+Tony+Hutchings%2fGetty+Images", "http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/miamb-marriott-stanton-south-beach/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlC6gG%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBm5H6a.img&description=pok-ta-pok+-+Luis+Acosta%2fAFP%2fGetty+Images", "http://mainstreet.com/", "http://www.hiltonhawaiianvillage.com/", "http://www.intercontinental-geneva.ch/"], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:43:50.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
