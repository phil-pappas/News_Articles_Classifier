The butler from Downton Abbey , that is. \nIn a display of typically dry and witty British humor, actor Jim Carter stars in a video to promote the city’s new theater, art, and music offerings. “We always take huge pride in our enormous modesty,” says Downton’s Mr. Carson says of his countrymen before going on to brag about London’s many cultural achievements. \nCarter teamed up with VisitLondon.com and GREAT Britain Campaign to promote the city’s Autumn Season of Culture, and he comments on many of the upcoming events. \nRelated: Completely Crazy?

(Photo: VisitLondon.com/ GREAT Britain Campaign) \n“If I were to pick one thing from the Autumn Season of Culture, I would pick the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition at the Natural History Museum,” Carter said of the exhibit that runs from Aug. 30 to Oct. 24 and includes professional and amateur photos. “You see photos on TV or in the magazines, but seeing these wonderful photographs for yourself is truly unbeatable.” \nHere are some other events to watch out for: \n“The World Goes Pop” at Tate Modern (Sept. 17 to Jan. 24, 2016): The exhibit will include about 200 works from the ‘60s and ‘70s and is meant to show how cultures around the world have contributed to pop art over the decades. \nRelated: How a Trip to London Changed My Life \n“The Crime Museum Uncovered” at the Museum of London (Oct. 9 to April 10, 2016): Lovers of underworld history will get to see previously confidential objects and evidence from the Metropolitan Police’s Crime Museum. Featured crimes include the Great Train Robbery of 1963 and the Millennium Dome Diamond Heist of 2000. \n“Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age” at the Science Museum (Sept. 18 to March 13, 2016): Russian spacecraft and artifacts will be on display to celebrate Cosmonauts’ contributions to space travel, from Soviet years to the International Space Station. \n“Gypsy” at the Savoy Theatre (through Nov. 28): The Broadway musical about American burlesque entertainer and stripper Gypsy Rose Lee will star Imelda Staunton, who happens to be Carter’s wife. Said the actor, “I would recommend going along to the Strand to see the fantastic Gypsy with Imelda Staunton in it. Although, I must admit I’m slightly biased, having been married to the leading lady for 31 years!” \nWATCH: How to Avoid Annoying The Locals In Britain on ‘A Broad Abroad\" \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
