The best shot of the year wins an Arctic activity and photography trip to Swedish Lapland\nEnter the August competition: the theme is coast Guardian readers\nFriday 31 July 2015 12.29 BST Last modified on Friday 31 July 2015 16.14 BST\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Rebecca Dorkins\nSunlight created sparkling summer colours on this freshly caught octopus I saw drying in Chania in Crete – it was late in the afternoon, as fishermen were returning to the harbour.\n Share Share this post close James Farley\nThe loud, bright colours and symmetrical design of this lifeguard station on South Beach in Miami epitomise summer for me.\n Share Share this post close Samuel Raybone\nI took this photograph from Parliament Hill, north London. Having captured a panorama of the City, as I was packing to leave I noticed how the last embers of the day illuminated a white tower block in orange and purple. The aircraft creeping into frame made it a perfect summer image for me: one of lingering evenings and the promise of adventure.\n Share Share this post close Isabella Pyrgies\nI live in Brighton and while walking back from town one evening I realised how lucky I was to live here. I tried to capture the thrill, fun and quirkiness of this seaside town. The West Pier and the carousel on the famous pebbled beach with the perfectly painted caption ‘pleasure & delight’ perfectly sums up summer for me.\n Share Share this post close Craig Fraser\nThe sun in northern Iceland on a summer’s evening.\n Share Share this post close Teresa Jozef\nAs a tourist I enjoy watching other tourists, to see how they spend their time. The moment when people arrive and admire their beautiful surroundings is very appealing to me. I took this picture in El Nido, Palawan, the Philippines – the tourists posing and lovely landscape reminded me how we all enjoy a summer break. I especially like the contrast between the landscape and the tourists’ outfits.\n Share Share this post close George Turnbull\nColourful sun umbrellas contrasting with the blue sea and sky prompted me to search for a pleasing composition on De Panne beach, north-west Belgium. On seeing the white boats I wanted to frame them with out-of-focus umbrellas and a family in the foreground, so as not to distract from the view on the horizon, giving a sense of adventure and intrigue out at sea.\n Share Share this post close Matt Davies\nA boy scooters towards the retro Cuddle Up pavilion which once housed tea cup rides at Glen Echo Park, Maryland, USA, while a plane cruises through the blue summer skies above.\n Share Share this post close Barra Bromley\nThe symbols of the sea – the tide marker, groyne, and sun bed – almost overshadow the sunbathing woman in Whitstable, Kent. This seems to add to her determination to make the best of the early summer day, lending the photo a Carry On feel. There’s also a sense of oneness between the subject and the calm sea behind.\n Share Share this post close Ben Hemmings\nA caballero riding home on Amantani island in Lake Titicaca, Peru. For me this image conjures up the warm glow of a long summer’s evening, adventure, nature and the great outdoors.\n Share Share this post close Chris Hansen\nI took this photo of my wife in the late afternoon, by a beachside bar in Binisafua, Menorca. The soft light, colour of the water and general feeling of complete relaxation comes across in the shot.\n Share Share this post close Claire Waring\nWildflower meadows in Swaledale, North Yorkshire, are renowned for their wonderful spectacle in summer as myriad flowers come into bloom. This golden carpet of buttercups at Isles Bridge, near Richmond, reminds me of carefree childhood summer days. Typical of our English summer, rain clouds threaten but the sun breaks through to light up this amazing scene.\n Share Share this post close Matt Parry, runner-up\nWalking along the beach huts in Whitby was like travelling back in time to the old days of British summers.\nMick Ryan, judge\nA great colourful holiday snap with a retro-Kodak and retro-subject feel to it. It brings a smile to the face, especially if you’ve ever holidayed at a UK seaside resort in the summer when the reality is often ‘bracing’ winds, sun and showers.\n Share Share this post close Giles Bennett, runner-up\nWe were visiting friends in Bontgoch, west Wales, on a super-hot day and their dogs were getting a much appreciated spray. It was a beautiful scene with the sun directly behind and their daughter looking on delighted at the dog’s playfulness. I took it in black and white to emphasise the shape and texture.\nMick Ryan, judge\nThis a captivating summer action photograph that could happen anywhere but well spotted by the photographer. Very well done with multiple but simple focal points made even more powerful by its conversion to black and white.\n Share Share this post close Ciara Milne, winner\nOn honeymoon in Montenegro. A trail led to a lake in Biogradska Gora national park where this tranquil scene stopped us in our tracks. Before one of the best swims of our holiday I stopped to take this photo, complete with holidaymakers perfectly expressing the feeling of total relaxation and quiet.\nMick Ryan, judge\nThis photograph captures the feeling of long hot summer days perfectly. A moment in time incredibly well recognised and composed, from the symmetry of the boats and deck, the postures of the figures and the distant hills above the mirror-calm lake.\n Share Share this post
