Wood eTN   \nBANGKOK, Thailand - As Bangkok struggles with the aftermath of Monday's pipe bomb at the Erawan shrine that killed more than 22 people, life in the city carries on. \nBombs or no bombs a joint chambers of commerce event at a city center hotel had a spectacular turnout last night. Australia, South Africa, Ireland, Singapore, and the NZ chamber members were all present. Most corporate business personnel were upbeat and commented about Thailand's resilience, and as in the past it will bounce back. \nThe chambers reported only fifty members cancelled for the event tonight at the Rembrandt Hotel, however, the turnout was extremely encouraging. \nWell done to the organizers, Allan Riddell and Pasit Foobunma (SATCC), and to sponsors DTC, Coral Expeditions, Island Tribe, and Capital TV. This is a sure case of “we will not be beaten” - the British bulldog spirit! \nThe event will also be hosted at the German Chamber networking evening in Pattaya at the Centara Mirage this Friday, August 21, 2015. \nA number of hotel managers commented to this correspondent that some room cancellations had started, particularly from within Asia - Chinese and Japanese visitors particularly. \nWhile normality is the goal of event organizers, other events in Bangkok slated to take place this week have been cancelled or postponed. So thumbs up to the chambers for “carrying on!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:36:25.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
