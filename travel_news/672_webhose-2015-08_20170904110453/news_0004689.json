First published in 1907, it was the essential guide for every young newlywed couple, and over the years it has become the biggest-selling book ever published in New Zealand. This is the first chutney I made and continues to be one of my staples. It is the perfect breakfast chutney with a poached egg on toast, bacon and eggs, or a bacon or sausage sarnie. With its clove-spiced undertones, it makes a lovely addition to the Christmas table. For tips and tricks on how to make the perfect preserves, read Chutneys, jams and pickled vegetables: a beginner's guide MAKES 6-7 x 350ml jars INGREDIENTS 1kg tomatoes (vine preferable) 1kg unpeeled apples 700g onions 600g dark brown sugar 750ml distilled malt vinegar 100g raisins For the spice bag: ½ lemon, quartered ½ lime, quartered 2 bird’s-eye chillies, halved 1 cinnamon stick, halved 1 tsp black peppercorns 1 tsp whole cloves INGREDIENTS The key to this recipe is to drain as much liquid as possible off the tomatoes to begin with and to reduce the chutney until it has thickened to the right consistency. Dice the tomatoes, sprinkle with two teaspoons of salt and mix together. Leave for 1-2 hours to draw out the liquid. Peel, core and chop the apples into 1cm pieces; peel and dice the onions. Drain off the excess liquid from the tomatoes. Put the tomatoes with the prepared spice bag and all the other ingredients, except the raisins, in a large, heavy-bottomed pan. Bring to a rapid boil. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring continuously, for 30-40 minutes, until the chutney begins to thicken. Stir in the raisins 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Use the trail test to check that the chutney is ready, then take off the heat and leave to cool for five minutes, stirring to release excess liquid as steam. Remove the spice bag, ladle into warm, dry sterilised jars and seal. Leave to mature in a cool, dark place for at least four weeks. It keeps for up to a year unopened. Once opened, refrigerate and eat within four months.
