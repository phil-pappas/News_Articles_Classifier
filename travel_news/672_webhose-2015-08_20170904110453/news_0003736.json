The MY Drenec was completely refitted and beautifully upgraded in 2012 with the interior designed by Sophie Bouakel-Kastelein. She is ideal for sailing Burma’s undiscovered coastal waters. She also carries her own dinghy, snorkelling equipment and even some water skis! A knowledgeable ex-pat expedition director leads each cruise.\nPandaw’s new coastal voyages will explore the southern region of Burma between a small Mon town of Thanbyuzayat and southernmost town of Victoria Point (Kawthaung). The region was closed to tourism until mid-2013 and there is still little tourism infrastructure in the town and cities, but now it is possible to explore the undiscovered old colonial ports and the incredibly beautiful and little known Mergui Archipelago with its thousand tropical islands, stunning white beaches and sea gypsy inhabitants. Pandaw’s itinerary also visits charming Moulmein and includes a stop at Kyaiktiyo Pagoda famous for its Golden Rock.\nHugh Clayson, Pandaw’s Commercial Director said: Pandaw clients will be one of the first to discover one of the world’s most beautiful, remote and undiscovered regions aboard the very comfortable and well-equipped expedition ship, the MY Drenec.\nSource: Pandaw", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:53:16.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
