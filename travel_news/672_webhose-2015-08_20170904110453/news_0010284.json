The fairest way for passengers to pay for standard airport services is through a single charge whereby all passengers pay the same fee to use the same core services. Optional services such as the use of air bridges are charged separately and in this manner, airlines do pay different prices depending on the services that they decide to use. This is the charging system that applies at Dublin Airport and at the vast majority of international airports. The Commission indicated in its report that it “does not believe there is anything to be gained by mandating the DAA to introduce differential pricing given it already does price differentially on occasion”.\nSource:- Dublin Airport Authority", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T13:54:28.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
