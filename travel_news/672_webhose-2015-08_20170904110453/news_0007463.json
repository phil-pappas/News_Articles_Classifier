There's a new way to look toned and honed – and it doesn't involve spending large sums of money every week for the privilege of hurting yourself while lifting clumps of metal. As student journalists Oli Dugmore and Bob Palmer have discovered , a quick spray and polish can now give you that muscular, beach-ready look that you've always wanted. In their report for the student newspaper The Tab, Dugmore and Palmer visit Amanda Harrington's bespoke tanning salon in Putney, London. Harrington has previously been described as \"London's top tanner\" , thanks to her patented body contouring technique, which can make you look slimmer or more muscular, depending on the service you choose. The body tint is readied at the start of Bob Palmer's contouring session Photo: Â© Tab / SWNS.com 'Student-bod' owner Palmer opts for the latter, morphing into the owner of a Hollywood torso thanks to the Harrington's artistic application of tints and creams. The end result is designed to fade away slowly over the course of roughly ten days. Harrington says she counts Bradley Cooper, Hugh Jackman, and Cara Delevingne among her clients. Brushes are used to sculpt more defined muscles Photo: Â© Tab / SWNS.com “Often people will appear in an article which says ‘so-and-so is in great shape – and check out their new tan’ and they’ll forward it to me and say ‘thanks, that’s you!’’ – but they all pretend it’s real,\" she told The Tab. “You can lose eight pounds with contouring. It becomes a confidence thing.” Photo: Â© Tab / SWNS.com The procedure takes around 60 minutes and costs £85 (which roughly equates to the cost of gym membership for a month in many London boroughs). @TelegraphMen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:20:20.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
