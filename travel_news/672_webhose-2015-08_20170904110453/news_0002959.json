Picture: Aero Icarus Source: Flickr \nTHE Latvian pilot of an airBaltic flight and three crew members have been pulled off the Greece-bound plane in Oslo after failing a breathalyser test before takeoff, Norwegian police say. \n“Results of the breathalyser tests confirmed that four of the five crew members ... were above the legal alcohol limit,” Romerike police prosecutor Edith Ek Sorensen said. \nThe pilot, co-pilot and two stewardesses — all from Latvia and employed by airBaltic — were taken into police custody and escorted to hospital for blood tests to confirm the breathalyser exams. Results were expected later. \nSorensen said police had acted after receiving a tip-off from an anonymous caller. \nAirBaltic spokesman Janis Vanags said the company had a “zero tolerance” policy with regard to alcohol. \n“Zero tolerance means no alcohol,” Vanags said. “It’s very straightforward — safety is our number one priority. \n“There has been an initial test and that is being followed up with more detailed tests. When we have the results we will take appropriate action,” he added, offering the company’s apologies to customers. \nThe airline even went so far as to release a video to show how sorry it is. We are sorry \nThe four risk up to two years in prison if found guilty. \nSorensen would not comment on the flight’s destination, but Norwegian daily Dagbladet said it was a tour group flight operated by the Norwegian group StarTour headed for Chania, Greece, with 109 passengers on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:58:15.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
