Only 49.9% of its flights arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, which is the government's definition of being on time. \nIt was the worst on-time performance by a major airline in 10 years. \nSpirit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nUnited Airlines had the second-worst on-time rating, at 66.3%. \"It wasn't the performance we like to provide for our customers,\" said spokesman Charlie Hobart. He said maintenance issues and bad weather -- thunderstorms at one of United's hub airports on 25 different days, he said -- contributed to the delays. \nUnited Airlines had the second-worst rating, at 66.3% on time. \nOverall, airlines covered by the U.S. Department of Transportation report operated 74.8% of their flights on time in June, up from 71.8% in June 2014. \nHawaiian Airlines, which benefits from many short flights in mostly good weather, finished on top, with 90.5 per cent of its flights landing on time, followed by Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Virgin America, all three of which beat 80%. \nSpirit performed poorly at nearly all airports it serves but was worst in Philadelphia, Chicago's O'Hare Airport and Detroit, where on-time percentages were in the 30s. About two in three flights were late. Nearly one-fourth of Spirit's flights were late at least 70% of the time in June. \nOn six routes, the Spirit delays averaged more than two hours. \nSpirit's on-time rating was the worst since June 2005, when Alaska Airlines posted a 49.8% mark. \nThe overall rate of complaints against airlines jumped 45% from June 2014, but Spirit alone was responsible for more than half the increase. It wasn't big enough to be included in the government reports last year. \nAccording to the government, 284 passengers filed complaints about Spirit. That's small compared with the number of passengers -- about one in 5,200. But the Miramar, Florida-based company had by far the highest complaint rate of the 14 airlines covered in the report. \nSpirit passengers were 43 times more likely to file a complaint than passengers on Alaska Airlines, which had the lowest complaint rate. More than half of the complaints against Spirit dealt with flight problems, with a smattering for refunds, baggage and customer service.
