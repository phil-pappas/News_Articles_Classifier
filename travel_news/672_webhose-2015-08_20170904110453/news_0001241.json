For the sixth consecutive year, Aloft is shining the spotlight on rising musical talent and giving these performers the chance to take the mic at Aloft hotels around the world. In a special twist this year, Aloft has tapped critically acclaimed indie pop star Ingrid Michaelson (\"The Way I Am\", \"Girls Chase Boys\") to act as special guest mentor for this year's finalists. \"I'm so excited to be a part of Project: Aloft Star this year - both personally and professionally,\" said Ingrid Michaelson. \"The platform and support Aloft Hotels offers rising musical talent is fantastic, and I can't wait to help in this search.\" #DigitalSearch: Emerging Talent across the Americas Invited to Win a Chance at Stardom Starting today through September 12, unsigned bands and artists across North America and Latin America are invited to upload an original song and photo to LiveAtAloftHotels.com for the chance to be named the 2015 Project: Aloft Star winner. An expert panel of music industry insiders will then comb through the submissions to identify the top five semi-finalists who will advance to the next phase of the competition. New this year, every Monday throughout the first phase, Michaelson will host \"Mentoring Mondays\" where unsigned bands and artists who enter Project: Aloft Star will be invited to post questions to Michaelson's Facebook page using #AloftLive and #ProjectAloftStar, for a chance to receive personal feedback and musical guidance directly from the indie songstress herself. #DownToFive: Fans Take to Facebook to Vote for the Best From September 28 - October 9, the five lucky semi-finalists will be featured on LiveAtAloftHotels.com, where music loving fans from around the world can vote for their favorite. An expert panel of music industry insiders will then pull together the fan votes and ultimately decide the two contestants who will advance to the live finale round in New York City. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T18:37:27.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
