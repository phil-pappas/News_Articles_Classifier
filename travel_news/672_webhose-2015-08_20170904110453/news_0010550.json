The move represents material progress in establishing a marketing alliance between the two parties.\nJin Jiang International Hotels and Prince Hotels signed a memorandum of understanding in June, under which, the two hotel groups will form a marketing alliance to collaborate on joint promotions and undertake other business exchanges, as well as improve brand awareness and market share by leveraging each other’s reputation, expertise and marketing network in the key customer markets identified by both groups. Mr. Simon Zhang, Chief Executive Officer at Jin Jiang International Hotels, said that the mutual benefits derived from forming an alliance and establishing a partnership with Prince Hotels will allow Jin Jiang International Hotels to further expand its international marketing network and to provide customers with more options and convenience, addressing the growing demand for casual and business travel in the Asian market.\nPrince Hotels, Inc. with its three main brands, The Prince, Grand Prince Hotel and Prince Hotel, is one of Japan’s leading hotel and leisure companies and operates 41 hotel facilities in Japan’s largest cities and leading holiday resorts, including Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Hakone, Karuizawa, Sapporo and Furano. The hotel group holds the largest market share in the Japanese hospitality sector.\nJin Jiang International Hotels expects to capitalize on the extensive visibility of Prince Hotel in the Japanese local market through the roadshow, and, by doing so, win more face to face negotiation opportunities and enhance cooperation with Japanese firms through promotional events and onsite visits with potential business partners. This event is expected to further expand the brand awareness and visibility of Jin Jiang International Hotels in the Japanese market.\nIn recent years, the increasing number of exchanges between Chinese and Japanese firms serving the business and leisure travel segments has created more opportunities for Jin Jiang International Hotels as the hotel group expands in the Japanese market. Mr. William Cai, Director Marketing & Sales at Jin Jiang International Hotels said that member hotels including Jin Jiang Hotel, Jin Jiang Tower, Hua Ting Hotel & Towers, Jian Guo Hotel, Rainbow Hotel, Park Hotel, Shanghai Hotel and Haiyun Jin Jiang International Hotel swill participate in the event.\nSource:-Jin Jiang International Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:11:57.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
