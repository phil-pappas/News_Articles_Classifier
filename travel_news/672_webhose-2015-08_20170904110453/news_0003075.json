The Guest House at Graceland will feature spacious rooms and a range of elegant and contemporary facilities, including two full-service restaurants, expansive meeting and special events space, a large outdoor pool and a 464-seat theater for live performances and movies. \nGraceland’s new, exclusive, Diamond-level “Founders” program will provide its members with VIP privileges at the new resort, including early, exclusive access to Guest House room reservations and priority admission to opening weekend celebration events. Founders will be able to book room reservations at the Guest House for the grand opening celebration starting this September -- 13 months in advance and well before the general public. \nThe Diamond-level Founders program is limited to only 250 members with a full roster of exclusive benefits including VIP invitations to special events and receptions, exclusive access to The Founders Club at the Guest House, VIP check-in, priority reservations for restaurants, live events and concerts, access to a private Founders path from The Guest House to the mansion grounds, special room rates, room upgrades and much more. Membership details are available at Graceland.com/TheFounders. \n“The Guest House at Graceland will be like no other hotel in the world – designed as if Elvis built an extension to his own home,” said Joel Weinshanker, Managing Partner of Graceland LLC. “Our guests will feel like they are staying in an actual guest room at the mansion, and they’ll experience the same warmth and southern hospitality that Elvis always showed his guests.” \n“Lisa and I, and our entire family, are excited to see The Guest House at Graceland take shape,” stated Priscilla Presley. “The Guest House will be the perfect place to stay while visiting Graceland and experiencing everything that Memphis has to offer. We can’t wait for this unique hotel to open in October 2016.” \nAs part of the Guest House opening weekend celebration, Elvis fans will gather to mark the closing of Graceland’s first hotel, Elvis Presley’s Heartbreak Hotel, with a ceremony to be held on October 26, 2016 to mark its final day of operations. The Heartbreak Hotel will be celebrated throughout its final year (October 2015 - October 2016) with exclusive Heartbreak Hotel mementos given to hotel guests and a select number of its most loyal guests being given the opportunity to take a piece of the Heartbreak Hotel home with them after the hotel closes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:45:43.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
