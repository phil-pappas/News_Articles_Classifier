Together, they will create a \"fast lane\" for iOS products in enterprise networks.The two companies also announced a plan to build tools to help iPhones and iPads take advantage of Cisco's business collaboration products, such as its voice and video conferencing services.By tightly integrating iOS and Cisco products, the end result could make iPhones and iPads perform better in corporate environments, as well as kickstart sales for the iPad, which has been experiencing declining sales for six consecutive quarters.\"Apple has mastered consumer, but not enterprise, and Apple is partnering in the enterprise on technologies and experiences that aren't their core competency,\" said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. \"Long-term, I think Apple is trying to completely rethink enterprise work and workflow.\"Although the two companies haven't laid out many of the technical details of this partnership yet, one area that Cisco and Apple could more tightly integrate is in Cisco's Spark and WebEx products, Moorhead said. They have iOS apps, but aren't engrained into the operating system like the way Twitter, Facebook and Facetime are. \"OS-based software delivers a better experience,\" Moorhead said. For networking, Cisco can modify its networks to make them smarter for faster and improved performance on iOS devices.Based on an interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Cisco Chairman John Chambers, the Wall Street Journal reported that the collaboration is the result of 10 months of hashing out the details. “It became clear to me that partnering with Cisco would yield the results that would enable us to transform work,” Cook told the journal.Under Tim Cook, Apple has been eager to push more of its devices into corporate environments. Last year, Apple partnered with IBM to work together on enterprise-focused apps. Apple also recently created a sales program to work with more than 40 technology companies to improve the iPad as a workplace tool with enterprise apps.“iOS is the world’s best mobile platform, and nearly every Fortune 500 and Global 500 company today has put iOS at the center of their mobile strategy,” said Cook in a statement. “iPhone and iPad have become essential tools for the modern workforce and are changing the way work gets done. Together with Cisco, we believe we can give businesses the tools to maximize the potential of iOS and help employees become even more productive using the devices they already love.”For Cisco, this could be a nice shot in the arm for the slow-growing networking giant. Since longtime sales executive Chuck Robbins took over as CEO in May this year, the company has been trying to focus more on more profitable divisions and making serious cuts in its workforce.", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-cisco-unveil-business-partnership-1441044139"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:24:08.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
