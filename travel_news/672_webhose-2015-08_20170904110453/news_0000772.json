Currie Dinosaur Museum, set for its grand opening Sept. 26, has launched helicopter tours over the Pipestone Creek dinosaur bone bed west of Grande Prairie. \nPassengers on the 15-minute ride listen to an audio track on iPads to learn about discoveries at the site, where there is an average of nearly 200 fossils per square metre. More than 3,000 bones have so far been recovered from the area. \nThe $195 tours showcase aerial views of the museum, Pipestone Creek and Wapiti River. \nThe tours depart from the museum 19 kilometres west of Grande Prairie, and run every 20 minutes throughout the day. \nONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:35:17.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
