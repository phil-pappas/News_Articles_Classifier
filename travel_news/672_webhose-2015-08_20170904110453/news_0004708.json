On a beach on one of the idyllic islands, perhaps? Or exploring the ancient sights of Athens?\nBut there’s a place in the north of the country – hopefully now recovering from the financial crisis – that offers all that and more.\nStunning architecture, fabulous beaches and the warmest of welcomes... so welcome to Halkidiki.\nI flew in to Thessaloniki – Greece’s second city – and headed first to the Gulf of Strymonikos and Olympiada, a lovely fishing village which is an ideal starting point to visit the area.\nHere, you are right by the sea and only a few minutes’ walk from Aristotle’s birthplace.\nIt’s well situated for a visit to Mount Athos, also known as the Holy Mountain, on one of Halkidiki’s three narrow peninsulas.\nHowever, it’s an autonomous monastic area with 20 monasteries and is only open to men.\nScenery: Margot by waterfall in the forest of Varvara\nWhether one of those visiting men has been Russia’s president Vladimir Putin... who knows? But the Kormilitsa wines from this region have been adopted at the Kremlin!\nOn your way from Thessaloniki to Olympiada, make a stop at Arnea.\nThe village, home to a few thousand people, is a typical mountain town, with small cobbled streets, secret passageways and old house facades, and many buildings have signs on the outside explaining their history.\nThe honey in Arnea is famous in the region, and rightly so. I recommend popping into a local shop and picking up a couple of pots (the honey made from chestnut flowers is specially good).\nAnd while you are there, do try a bit of Mountovina, an alcoholic drink made from honey – it will certainly clear any stuffiness you might have picked up on the flight.\nAfter your quick honey pitstop, visit Arnea’s church of Agios Stefanos. Remains of an ancient church were found under the current building and as you walk through you can see them from above, protected by a layer of glass.\nHarbour: Halkidiki\nAll this sightseeing was building an appetite and chef Dimitrios Bakatsianos’s fabulous restaurant beckoned. The place is hidden away in a forest of trees, making it an ideal spot to shelter from the searing sun ( bakatsianos.gr/en/ ).\nDo as the Greeks do and order a variety of plates to share across the table. We piled in to forest ­potatoes cooked in a clay pot, with cheese, egg and truffle (€8.50), and sausage (€7.50) on which you squeeze a little lemon juice – unlike anything you will find at home. And the roasted feta cheese (€3.50) is something else entirely.\nEnjoy your meal surrounded by nature with a bottle of local wine. If you still have space after all that food, the dessert menu is well worth a look – ice cream encased\nin little filaments of pastry finishes off the meal perfectly.\nI was staying at the Hotel Germany in Olympiada, situated ideally by the beach. The setting is perfect for a glass of Tsipouro brandy in the evening – actually it seems to be offered at all times of the day!\nIt’s a family-run hotel that will make you feel at ease, with the sound of the waves lulling you to sleep. Breakfast is served on the terrace, a mix of local yogurt, bread, jams and pastries. The dining room gives you a glimpse into the open kitchen, so you can watch your food being prepared.\nTry the local mussels, either steamed or deep fried. They are the best I’ve ever had (and I say this as a Belgian).\nAnd if you like your seafood, the octopus with figs cooked in wine is unlike anything you will have tried before – but it is magnificent.\nRugged: Coastline near Mount Athos\nThe local mussels are known for their taste and size – the warm waters help them develop – and I headed to a mussel farm in Olympiada for a tour.\nHere, you get to see the farming in action and, if you’re up for it, try a mussel straight from the sea – they have a taste not unlike oysters. If you can, arrange for the visit to include lunch.\nIf you want to burn off a few calories you’re in luck as this area is ideal for walks – and ancient Stagira, Aristotle’s birthplace, is great for roaming among the ruins, enjoying the sea views and doing a little philosophising yourself.\nInland also offers some idyllic locations and I visited the forest of Varvara, which\nis famous for its pair of waterfalls in the trees.\nIt’s perfect for a picnic in the beautiful surroundings – maybe pick up some\ndelicacies from the nearby town of Varvara itself.\nAnd if you are feeling a little too hot, dip your feet and ankles in the clear water. Then find a large rock, lie back, relax and take in as much of the peace and quiet as possible.\nFrom the food to the forest to the sea and the scenery, you’ll struggle to leave this part of Halkidiki.\nBut a solution is at hand.\nSimply have a sip of water at the fountain in Arnea’s main square; legend has it that whoever drinks it will stay for ever...\nGet there Ramblers Holidays has 7nt h/b walking holidays in eastern Halkidiki from £899pp inc flights from Gatwick on Oct 17, transfers, accommodation at the Hotel Liotopi in Olympiada ( hotel-liotopi.gr/en/ ) and guided walks. ramblersholidays.co.uk\nRooms at the Hotel Germany in Olympiada start at £91pn h/b in Sept based on 2 sharing. hotel-germany.gr\neasyJet flies to Thessaloniki from Manchester and Gatwick.
