The display of armed might has put off some invited countries from attending given ongoing tensions between China and Japan over wartime history and competing claims to islands in the East China Sea. \nChina's fast growing air travel market is the world's second biggest, but the heavy air traffic and tight control of airspace by the military have given it the world's worst record for flight delays. \nThink your friends should see this?
