Some people blame the recession, or the advent of tuition fees stopping students going out partying. Others say it is because the pubs are staying open later, or that people prefer music festivals. \nBut Alan Miller, chairman of the recently founded Night-time Industries Association and the former owner of a nightclub on Brick Lane in London’s East End, blames a deliberate effort by the police and local councils to strangle the clubs in red tape. More Property shortage leads to busy July \n“The real pressure is the new mentality from the authorities,” said Mr Miller, whose Vibe Bar shut after he was asked to install CCTV cameras and scanners to record details of ID cards, and hire large numbers of security guards. The last straw was the imposition of a 1am curfew. Clubbers were often “being treated like they’re going into a prison”, he said. \nMadame Jojo’s, a legendary Soho haunt, shut in November after 50 years following a fight between a bouncer and a punter. The owners offered to employ a new security team but this was not enough to stop its licence being revoked by Westminster council. \nThe Arches in Glasgow, which had a theatre and café as well as club nights, shut in June after demands for stricter security based on concerns over drug use. Police persuaded the council to impose a midnight licence, forcing the venue to close. At one point the police had asked the club to introduce “moments of calm” and turn the music off and the lights up for five minutes every hour (the idea was never implemented). \nFigures out this week showed the number of nightclubs in the UK has fallen to 1,733 from 3,144 a decade ago, according to the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, the industry body. The statistics were striking as the British clubbing scene was once considered among the most vibrant and varied in the world. \nOne owner of several big London clubs, who declined to be named, said this was the result of police blaming club owners for any kind of confrontation or antisocial behaviour outside the premises. “Crime happens whenever a large group of people get together,” the club owner said. “But at shopping centres and football stadiums the police cannot object to it, whereas they can and do with nightclubs.” \nMr Miller cited a speech in May by Bernard Hogan-Howe, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, outlining how the force could cut crime with fewer resources, and suggesting that task would be easier if there were fewer pubs and clubs. “We need to make sure there is good control of the supply of alcohol,” he said. “We know that many injuries occur inside or outside licensed premises, and if we can close down the repeat offenders, we will.” \nThe National Police Chiefs’ Council said most venues were safe and legal and that there was plenty of “joint working” between owners and officers to cut crime. \nBut other club owners blame the “crackdown on fun” not on police but on councils giving in to complaints from a minority of residents, particularly in parts of London where the buzzing nightlife attracts large numbers of young people. \nAlex Proud, who runs the venue Proud Camden, said: “In the 1980s it was crazy, you couldn’t get anyone to close anything down. But it’s gone completely the other way now . . . We’ll end up like Geneva or Frankfurt.” \nHe added: “If you don’t like noise, don’t live in a town centre.” \nOne battleground is Hackney, which has seen rapid change over the past 20 years, spearheaded by a vibrant bar and club scene. \nIn a recent draft council review of the area’s nightlife, a team of Hackney councillors stated: “Hackney’s current night-time economy is based too much on alcohol consumption and late-night bars and clubs that fit this culture. There is too much of an emphasis on venues for young people in Shoreditch and Dalston,” referring to the borough’s two hotspots. \nThe draft proposal setting “normally acceptable” hours for various types of new licence declared that nightclubs were “not considered appropriate”. This sparked a local campaign — with the inevitable #notconsideredappropriate hashtag — signed by 4,000 people which this week forced the council to postpone a consultation on its proposals. \nAt a rally on Wednesday evening in a Shoreditch street food emporium, Henry Dimbleby, a restaurateur and the campaign’s organiser, railed against what he called a “silent minority who want to impose their cultural norms on the rest of us”. \nDan Beaumont, a DJ and proprietor of the Dalston Superstore bar and neighbouring Dance Tunnel club, said he had detected a “hardening” of attitudes in authority. He dismissed the idea people no longer wanted to go clubbing. “Dance music and club culture is bigger than it’s ever been,” he added.
