Published on : Thursday, August 20, 2015\nFresh from winning Best Conference Venue Customer Service at the recent Conference Awards 2015, Cavendish Conference Centre continues to raise the bar as a member of The Westminster Collection with a refreshed look too.\nThe Auditorium along with the Whittington Suite, ideal for exclusive use for product launches and AGMs for up to 250 guests, has been undergoing an exciting transition this August.\nDermot Waldron, Operations Director and partner at Cavendish Venues emphasized: “Our clients are our future and we invest for the future. This major financial investment into what is already a state-of-the-art venue only goes to further enhance the status and service that we provide to our clients – that’s been a winning formula for the last 20 years which we look to continue for the next 20. It’s a very exciting time ahead for the team at Cavendish Venues. With this development showing our clients to be at the forefront of our ambitions, we have undertaken to make achieving their objectives smooth with the latest amenities so that every event works seamlessly.”\nTo celebrate, the Cavendish Conference Centre is hosting a special evening of Thursday 1st October 2015 to experience the venue in a light you’ll never have seen before. As part of an official rebranding as Cavendish Venues, corporate event bookers should register their interest now to attend the event as it’s first come, first served.\nSource:- HBAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:35:18.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
