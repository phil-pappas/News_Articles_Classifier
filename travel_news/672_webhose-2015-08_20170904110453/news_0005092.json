The span was then “pushed” starting from pillar P157 towards pillars P 156 at Rajouri Garden intersection. The steel span was pushed about 60 mtrs to reach the final location. The pushing work was started on 11th August, 2015 and was completed by 17th August.\nAbout 12 ‘HILLMAN’ rollers of capacity 200 MT each and 2 nos. hydraulic jacks of capacity of 50MT were engaged to complete the launching operation.The launching of the steel span was carried out in the night hours so as to avoid inconvenience to the road traffic during the day time. Adequate traffic marshals were deployed to regulate the traffic.\nUsually, Delhi Metro uses spans of 31 metres for construction of viaduct, but due to the presence of heavy traffic on the ring road, this mammoth steel span which is much longer in length (almost double) has been used to connect the upcoming Rajouri Garden station with the viaduct joining the line further to the upcoming Mayapuri station.\nSource:-Delhi Metro", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:11:10.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
