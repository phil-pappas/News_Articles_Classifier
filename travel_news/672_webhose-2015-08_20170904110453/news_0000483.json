This time we decided there would be no turning back. \nWe locked in a schedule a fortnight before D Day centred on the first matinee performance of the classic musical, Anything Goes, at the Lyric Theatre. \nThe show is only booked for a short run in Brisbane, finishing on August 16 before it ships out to Sydney, which meant no changing our minds. \nA noon arrival in Brisbane allowed for an easy check-in to the Sofitel, which is just a 25-minute stroll from the Lyric Theatre. With the matinee starting at 1.30pm that meant a drop-in to a favourite pub for a quick counter lunch was easily manageable. \nBefore I detail how we filled in the remainder of our day in Brisbane let me reflect on our musical. \nThe storyline involving shipboard frolics on the Liner SS American has been told and retold numerous times since Cole Porter first penned it way back in 1934, and while it has been modernised I'll be brutally honest and say that after 15 minutes I started to think maybe we had chosen the wrong play to watch. \nThat is a strange comment to make because an hour and a half later I was one of the first to give it a standing ovation. Suffice to say it's a little slow in the beginning, but it ends with a bang. \nTheatre royalty Caroline O'Connor is superb in the lead role as Reno Sweeney and it's worth buying a ticket just to watch her perform. \nJust a breath behind her as the star of the show is Wayne Kermond who plays Moonface Martin. It's a role that could well have been written for him. \nAussie favourite Todd McKenney's part in the show doesn't shine until after the break. The packed matinee crowd gave him plenty of support and he didn't let them down. \nThe clock chimed 4pm as we left the theatre, leaving us with plenty of time for a different type of Brisbane sightseeing trip. We clambered onboard Steve and Lyndal Torpey's CruiseMe luxury pontoon for a ride down the waterway. \nChampagne and cheese platters were welcome friends on the sedate ride. If you are visiting Brisbane with a group of up to 11 friends it's an ideal way to spend the afternoon discovering the beauty of the river. \nAfter a few hours gliding along the waterways we were back at the Sofitel for a freshen-up before our dinner booking at Jellyfish. It was our first visit to the seafood speciality restaurant we had heard glowing reports about. A two-hour cruise on the Brisbane River with CruiseMe is a special way to watch the sun go down on a perfect day. Photo Contributed \nA packed house vindicated the reputation when we arrived at Jellyfish which is located right on the Brisbane River in the heart of the action precinct. \nJellyfish prides itself on sourcing the best and freshest fish and our table certainly tested them out. \nBetween us we ordered rainbow trout, barramundi, garfish, mahi mahi and snapper and the conversation soon turned to who had selected the best. \nWe were united in that all varieties were cooked beautifully and while the voting was close the whole-baby barramundi won the gold. \nWashed down with a Reserve Villa Maria Sauvignon Blanc the meal has now gone down as one of our best in Brisbane. \nA walk back up to the Sofitel was needed, but we were keen to close off our 24 hours in Brisbane with a good sleep, so instead it was a quick cab ride. \nThe next morning a late breakfast at the Sofitel reading the Sunday paper before a noon checkout wound up a 24-hour break that ticked all the boxes. \nIt wasn't the cheapest way to spend a day in Brisbane, but who doesn't need spoiling now and then? \n*The writer was a guest of Brisbane Marketing. \nSEE \nAnything Goes: Season runs until August 16 at QPAC, Brisbane \nTicketing: 136 246 \nhttp://www.qpac.com.au or http://www.visitbrisbane.com.au \nSTAY \nSofitel Brisbane Central: Cruise into town with the Sofitel Brisbane Central's Anything Goes Breakfast Drive package.
