The Latest on Ferguson: Crowd thins along West Florissant Page 1 of 1 \nIt’s not surprising that it gets confused for the atomic testing site in New Mexico, but the Los Alamos that’s 50 miles north of Santa Barbara is decidedly more peaceful. \nWith an unhurried pace, personable shopkeepers and a bounty of wholesome grub, the cozy town is a refuge from the less pleasant signifiers of 21st century life. Throwback decor and antique shops filled with goods that predate overseas plastic call to mind an optimistic period in our history. \nBut don’t let this quaintness fool you. Today, Los Alamos’ vintage facades house city-savvy eateries, stylish accommodations and contemporary tasting rooms that highlight the region’s wines. \nThe former stagecoach stop makes for a worthwhile overnighter for those taking the scenic route to Southern California or tasting through the Santa Ynez Valley wine country. \nWhy now? You’ll want to experience the town’s homespun charm before the under-the-radar locale blossoms into a more popular destination. \nBackstory: Repurposed filling stations — some still sporting vintage pumps that warn of lead — underline the town’s former role as a highway pit stop. Founded in 1876 by San Franciscans who made their way to the Santa Ynez Valley, Los Alamos was a stagecoach stop before it became a stop along the Pacific Coast Railway. When Highway 101 bypassed the heart of town in the 1960s, it was left frozen in time like a wine country Radiator Springs. \nChecking in: The newly refurbished Alamo Motel, a 1940s motor court with glowing neon sign, is short on luxury but high on style. The remodeled property takes design cues from Georgia O’Keeffe’s New Mexico homes, with a soft, earthy palette and airy, stripped-down accommodations. A stand-alone studio houses a tasting room for Santa Barbara’s Municipal Wines, whose Rhone blends sip easy on the rocking chairs and tree swings out front. At night, a central lawn and fire pit draw sociable guests together under strands of lights. \nSpend your day: Most visitors are content to stroll main-drag Bell Street, popping in and out of its many antique stores, cafes and tasting rooms. Fluffy homemade English-muffin sandwiches are reason enough to stop by Bob’s Well Bread Bakery. Bob Oswaks, a 30-year Hollywood exec, traded his post at Sony for a stint at the San Francisco Baking Institute before opening a delightful bakery and cafe in a former filling station. \nAcross the street, Depot Antique Mall is what a garage sale at the Smithsonian might look like. Housed in the last surviving Pacific Coast Railway station, its three hangar-size rooms with creaky wooden floors are crammed with decades of pop culture detritus. \nWhen it’s time to wet your whistle, the Union Hotel hides a richly atmospheric Old West saloon that pours the wines of actors Kurt Russell and Kate Hudson . Grab a glass and wander the time-capsule property and its enchanting garden. \nDining: The vibe at Bell Street Farm is akin to that of a wedding reception in full swing. The upbeat tone is set by charismatic owner Jamie Gluck , who meanders through the dining room in a cowboy hat greeting most diners by first name. You’ll become a regular too after tasting the succulent rotisserie chicken and deeply satisfying porchetta sandwich. A relaxing back patio with shaded picnic tables set with mason jars of dahlias reminds you of its wine country setting. \nFull of Life Flatbreads fires up organic, thin-crust pizzas like the robust Pepperoni & Pepper pie laced with pasilla peppers and meltingly thin slices of pepperoni. The down-to-earth vibe is reflected in a wine list cover that states “Les Get Shum Dwinks” drawn in crayon by child or possibly tipsy adult. \nDon’t miss: Clinking pints of rare craft brews at cozy-cute Babi’s Beer Emporium. Sonja Magdevski and her husband, actor-director Emilio Estevez , also own adjacent Casa Dumetz Wines, which features Rhone varietals in a tasting room that could be a stage set for a European countryside cafe. \nDon’t bother: Going early in the week. You’ll miss the crowds, but also the shopkeepers who stay home after lively weekends. \nWord to the wise: The town has garnered some Hollywood attention, but they leave the red carpet behind. A sign at Babi’s warns against photos, lest you buy the bar a round before being thrown out on your, ahem, Google Glass. \nGarrick Ramirez is a freelance writer.
