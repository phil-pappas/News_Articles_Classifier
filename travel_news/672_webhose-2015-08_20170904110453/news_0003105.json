A month or months.\"\nJohn Goglia, a former board member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, told Reuters news agency: \"The real work is yet to begin\".\n\"They will identify everything they can from the metal: damage, barnacles, witness marks on the metal. They're going to look at the brackets (that held the flaperon in place) to see how they broke. From that they can tell the direction and attitude of the airplane when it hit. There's a lot to be told from the metal.\"\nHowever, experts said the cause of the disaster may remain beyond the reach of investigators until other debris or data and cockpit voice recorders are recovered.\n\"A wing's moving surfaces give you far fewer clues than bigger structures like the rudder, for example. As a single piece of evidence, it is likely to reveal quite little other than it comes from MH370,\" said a former investigator who has participated in several international probes of crashes at sea.\nThe examination of the part is being carried out under the direction of a judge at a French military aeronautical test facility in Balma, a suburb of the southwestern city of Toulouse, and witnessed by Malaysian and other officials.\nOfficials from Australia, Britain, China, Singapore and the United States as well as manufacturer Boeing were also on hand. Boeing said it was providing technical expertise.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:04:11.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
