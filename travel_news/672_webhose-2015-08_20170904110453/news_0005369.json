Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 06, 2015 Adv: \nBurundi’s capital Bujumbura, until now linked by Brussels Airlines flights via Nairobi to Brussels, will see a major routing change when the winter schedule 2015/16 comes into effect in October. \nWhen Brussels Airlines exits the Nairobi route in favor of Lufthansa at the start of the winter schedule – in turn Brussels Airlines will take over from Lufthansa the route to Accra / Ghana – the Bujumbura flights will be combined with Kigali / Rwanda. \nOperating every Wednesday and Sunday from Brussels via Kigali to Bujumbura under flight number SN 451 passengers save some added flying time due to the shorter distance between Bujumbura and Kigali as opposed to the longer flight to Nairobi. \nInspite of the volatile political situation in Burundi, Brussels Airlines decided to keep the destination online, facilitating travel to and from East Africa’s smallest economy as one of only two international airlines offering direct flights on intercontinental routes. \nTravelers intending to travel to Burundi are reminded that Visa must be obtained in advance, i.e. prior to the flight, as the airline will otherwise have to deny boarding. Visa on arrival are no longer available for passengers arriving in Bujumbura.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T04:16:13.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
