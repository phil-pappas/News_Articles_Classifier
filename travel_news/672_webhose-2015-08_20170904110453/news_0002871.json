Qantas will add an extra row of seats to its fleet of 737s. Picture: Supplied. Source: News Corp Australia \nQANTAS will squeeze an extra row of economy class seats on its 737 aircraft as part of a refurbishment of its fleet. \nAlan Joyce visited the Brisbane heavy maintenance facility today to announce the changes to the fleet of 67 737s, which fly the majority of domestic short-haul flights for the airline. \nHe said the additional six seats would be possible by changes to the galley and rest room area, increasing capacity on each aircraft by three per cent. \nCurrently each 737 has 12 business seats, and 156 economy. \nThe changes will mean the aircraft have 162 economy seats, as well as 12 business seats. \nVirgin Australia’s 737-800 aircraft have eight business class seats, and 168 economy. Room for more ... Qantas will add an extra row of seats on each of its 737 fleet, to create an additional three per cent capacity. Picture: Charles Brewer/News Corp Australia Source: News Limited \n“Qantas will still have less seats on this aircraft than all of its competitors, we still have the most luxurious level of comfort on our 737s,” Mr Joyce said. \n“The same pitch will apply to every seat that we have today but what customers get out of this is new fabric, new seats, all refreshed.” \nThe additional seats have the potential to generate an extra $1200 a flight for Qantas, based on an average fare of $200. Breathing space ... Qantas says more economy seats won’t compromise leg room. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \n“The 737 is the backbone of our domestic fleet and this refresh is part of our strategy to deliver the best experience for our customers, whether they’re in the air or on the ground,” Mr Joyce said. \nThe overhaul would also provide in-flight wireless streaming to those 737s currently not fitted with personal seat back video. \n“To get in flight entertainment for every seat (via passengers’ personal devices), will mean 400-hours of content including great channels like HBO which are available to our customers,” Mr Joyce said. Entertainment ... Passengers will be able to access Qantas in flight entertainment on personal devices. Picture: Supplied. Source: Supplied \nQantas will also embark on a major lounge upgrade and expansion in domestic and international terminals, increasing capacity by 30 per cent. \nVirgin Australia is also in the process of extending and upgrading its lounge, with the addition of “premium entry” for guests to avoid queuing for security. \nMr Joyce said work on all the new lounge facilities would begin before the end of the year, with completion dates throughout 2016 and early 2017. \n“Brisbane is a crucial hub providing connections between our major domestic routes and services into regional areas as well as international flights to Los Angeles, Singapore, Hong Kong and as of a few weeks ago, daily flights to Tokyo,” he said. Competitor ... Virgin Australia's expanded lounge at Brisbane Airport opened in April. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nEarlier this week, Qantas announced an additional 95 flights between Brisbane and New Zealand in the peak summer holiday period, following Virgin Australia’s decision to increase seasonal services. \n“Qantas has never been bigger here in Queensland,” said Mr Joyce. \n“This is a new reinvigorated Qantas making a big investment for the state of Queensand, making big investment for our cusomters, and making a big investment for our future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:49:44.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
