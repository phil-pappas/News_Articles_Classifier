One of the many ways to get out and enjoy the beautiful lakefronts and rivers in Holland can be a fun event through kayaking or paddleboarding. People of all ages can learn how to kayak and paddleboard, and there are many locations in the Holland and outside areas that allow for rentals to be used out on the water \"Kayaking is a great activity for people of all ages. We have had customers ranging from small children to people in their 70s. Many are surprised by how easy, fun, and relaxing it can be. Our customers often state that they wonder what had taken them so long to try kayaking and that they will be looking to purchase their own as soon as they can,” said Aaron Steenwyk from the Macatawa Boat House.
