Rosetta’s high-resolution OSIRIS camera had no problem capturing the brief show from 115 miles (186 km) away.\nSudden outbursts of material have been witnessed before by Rosetta, like this one on March 12. But this has by far been the boldest.\n“This is the brightest jet we’ve seen so far,” said Carsten Güttler, OSIRIS team member at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany. “Usually, the jets are quite faint compared to the nucleus and we need to stretch the contrast of the images to make them visible — but this one is brighter than the nucleus.”\nANALYSIS: Rosetta’s Comet Fires its Jets\nAs comets approach the sun their surfaces heat up from increasing solar radiation. This thaws frozen material trapped beneath the surface, which sublimates (turns from solid ice straight to gas) and bursts outwards, shooting icy, reflective material into space at high velocity.\nOSIRIS before and after images of a brief, bright jet erupting from Comet 67P’s “neck” on July 29, 2015. ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/LAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA These outbursts not only create bright jets but also incite activity in the expanding dust environment surrounding the comet’s nucleus, which in turn interacts with the solar wind.\nANALYSIS: Rosetta Watches Comet Erupt With a Dusty Surprise\nAt 02:03 GMT on Thursday, Aug. 13 (that’s 10:03 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 12 EDT) Comet 67P will be at perihelion, its closest point to the sun along the path of its 6.5-year-long orbit through the solar system. It will pass within 115.5 million miles (186 million km, or 1.24 AU) of the sun before beginning its trip back out past the orbit of Jupiter. Luckily for us ESA’s Rosetta and Philae spacecraft are along for the ride, and will intimately observe the evolution of the comet during this dramatic “hot” part of its journey.\nLearn more about Comet 67P and the Rosetta mission here.\nSource: ESA\nTags Rosetta ESA Rosetta ESA Current Events Comets Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko Comet Space ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Comet_s_firework_display_ahead_of_perihelion", "http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news", "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/blogs/dnews-files-2015-08-rosetta-jet2-670x440-150811-jpg.jpg", "http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2015/04/Comet_jet_awakens"], "published": "2015-08-11T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:25:56.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
