The robot requests elevators via Wi-Fi, calls the room ahead of its deliveries and (when it senses the room door has opened) pops open a two-cubic-foot cargo container before departing with R2D2-like electronic happy noises.\nThis robot is manufactured by Savioke , a company in Silicon Valley, and made its first appearance in August 2014 at the Aloft Cupertino, where it is known as Botlr. The hotel chain added a second robot-served location in the Aloft Silicon Valley earlier this year.\nThis month the nearby Crowne Plaza San Jose-Silicon Valley introduced its version of the system, which it calls Dash, to handle room deliveries.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
