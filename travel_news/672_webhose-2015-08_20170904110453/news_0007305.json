The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission voted Thursday to approve a portion of Yellow Cab of Pittsburgh's request to raise its rates. The PUC has approved an increase in Yellow Cab's \"flag drop\" charge, which is the amount charged when a trip begins, from its current rate of $2.25 to $4, as well as an increase in the waiting time rate from 25 cents per minute to 55 cents per minutes, according to Jamie Campolongo , president of Pittsburgh Transportation Group , parent company of Pittsburghâ€™s Yellow Cab \"This is a driver-driven increase, and it's good news for the drivers,\" Campolongo said. Yellow Cab's most recent rate increase was approved in January 2008. At the end of July the PUC denied Yellow Cab's request to institute higher weekend and holiday surcharges. The company had requested surcharges of up to $8 for every trip from 5 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Saturday and also between 5 p.m. Saturday to midnight Saturday. It is also asked to raise the holiday and Sunday surcharge \"not to exceed $8 per trip.\" Campolongo said the company is adjusting its proposal and will file another request to include a static weekend charge. \"Today's decision gives drivers some needed relief,\" Campolongo said. \"It's another step that allows us to become more competitive and compete with Uber and (transportation network companies) on a more level playing field.\" \nGet Pittsburgh  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:04:45.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
