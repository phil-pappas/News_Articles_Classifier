(AP) â€” Officials say tourism is surging so far this year in South Dakota, spurred on by landmark events such as the 75th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, good weather and reasonable gas prices.\nExpectations for 2015 have been high because of key events like the rally and the 50th annual Buffalo Roundup at Custer State Park.\nThe state Tourism Department noted nearly $350 million in tourism taxable sales for this year at the end of July, which is more than 14 percent higher than the same period last year.\nKirk Hulstein is research and visitor services manager at the department. He says indicators show that 2015 could be \"one of our biggest years ever.\"\nSoutheast South Dakota Tourism executive director Jacquie Fuks (FOOKS) says good weather and gas prices have also helped.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T03:45:28.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
