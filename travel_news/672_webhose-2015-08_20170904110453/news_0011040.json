It will eventually offer 3-D printing for hand and face prostheses. The eight-story building is also envisioned as a learning center where surgeons from the region and the West can teach each other new skills.\nIn this Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015 photo, Syrian girl Salam Rashid, 14, who lost both of her legs below the knee in 2012 in a tank shell attack, poses for a picture at the MSF Hospital for Specialized Reconstructive Surgery in Amman, Jordan.

(AP Photo/Muhammed Muheisen) \"It's a very new approach of war surgery,\" says Marc Schakal, head of MSF in Jordan.\nThe need for the facility is also testimony to how the region's conflicts become more horrific.\nMSF doctors began running a reconstructive surgery program in a wing of Jordan's Red Crescent facilities in 2006. At that time, the focus was on treating casualties from the Iraq war. Now, it's Iraq , the civil war in Syria and repeated Israel-Hamas conflicts in Gaza, all of which take a terrible toll on civilians.\nIn this Monday, Aug. 17, 2015 photo, Syrian girl Salam Rashid, 14, who was injured in 2012 by a tank shell attack, lies on a bed in a corridor of MSF Hospital for Specialized Reconstructive Surgery, waiting to be taken to the operation room for surgery, in Amman, Jordan.

(AP Photo/Muhammed Muheisen) Now 15, Ahmed has undergone almost a dozen surgeries, Saud said. Ahmed has gone back and forth between Iraq and Jordan multiple times.\nMost recently, Saud implanted a balloon-like device near Ahmed's clavicle that is being expanded gradually to grow skin to replace Ahmed's scarred neck tissue. That will allow him to move his neck more easily and hopefully have the extra effect of straightening Ahmed's mouth, which droops on one side — but if it doesn't, Saud will do another procedure to fix that.\nBut it will be at least another month before the neck surgery can be done, Saud tells Ahmed.\nIn this Monday, Aug. 17, 2015 photo, a group of patients wait for their turn to be checked by a doctor at MSF Hospital for Specialized Reconstructive Surgery, run by the international charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) in Amman, Jordan. The hospital MSF has a capacity of 200 _ it’s at 180 children and adults currently _ and the need is immense. In Syria alone, more than 1 million have been wounded in the war since 2011, the World Health Organization recently estimated. (AP Photo/Muhammed Muheisen) Ahmed says surgeries no longer faze him, but the waiting is hard. His latest stretch in Jordan has already lasted 14 months. He has years of schooling to catch up on.\nAhmed and other patients and their caretakers — usually a relative — live at a nearby hotel, their travel and residency costs paid by MSF. They cook in a communal kitchen and gather around a TV in the evenings, especially to watch soccer matches.\nFor Ahmed, football is a welcome distraction. Some evenings, he and other burn victims his age — all close friends — play on a lot across the street from the hotel.\nIn this Monday, Aug. 17, 2015 photo, a patient stretches his leg during a physiotherapy session at MSF Hospital for Specialized Reconstructive Surgery in Amman, Jordan.

There she hoisted herself onto a low chair and joined other children coloring under the supervision of a counselor. In contrast to her rambunctious playmates, Salam kept quiet.\nA few days later, she lay on a gurney ahead of surgery to reshape the stumps so doctors could fit new prostheses. She trembled slightly as she was wheeled into the operating theater.\nIn this Monday, Aug. 24, 2015 photo, Iraqi Ahmed Khalefeh, 15, who was injured by a car bomb in 2010, sits on a hotel bed watching the sports channel on a T.V. in Amman, Jordan.
