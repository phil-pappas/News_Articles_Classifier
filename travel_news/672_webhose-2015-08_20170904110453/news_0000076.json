The brainchild of seasoned aviation professionals, James Seagrim, Matthew Walter, and Geoffrey Cassidy, Zetta Jet promises to draw together the very best in talent, facilities and technology to deliver a revolutionary private flight experience.\nJames Seagrim, Director of Operations reveals, “Zetta Jet’s operations are flexible, fast acting, and able to react to the ever-changing environment in which we operate. Linking key cities across the globe, from Moscow to Los Angeles, and New York to Beijing, makes Zetta Jet a first for North American Business Aviation.”\nZetta Jet is a FAA certificated air carrier and the first only part 135 operator authorized to conduct Polar flights, enabling Zetta Jet to optimize routes without limitation. On a typical flight between Los Angeles and Moscow, this translates to over a 1.5 hours time saving.\nTaking the in-flight experience to a new level\nZetta Jet delivers an in-flight experience that is without parallel in the industry. Once onboard their newly commissioned, state-of-the-art Bombardier Global 6000, guests will have access to the fastest Ku-band in-flight Wi-Fi available, experiencing the softest of rides in a whisper quiet cabin, curated with only the finest of amenities. From hand-tailored Egyptian cotton linens to a carefully designed wine list from a renowned sommelier, no detail is overlooked. Such luxury indulgences are surpassed only by the white-glove service provided by Zetta Jet’s elite team of In-flight Concierges.\nTrue to its international outlook, the Zetta Jet experience combines the dedicated Asian service philosophy with the flexibility and ‘can-do’ spirit of the U.S., adorned with the glamour of Europe’s enduring chic. At the core of Zetta Jet’s philosophy is the conviction that no desire is too extravagant and no request too difficult.\nThe gift of time\nThe Zetta Jet team understands that the greatest luxury by far is that of time. Because Zetta Jet owns and operates their own fleet, their guests are not beholden to the timetables and lengthy check-ins of commercial airlines, nor to the whims and schedules of private charter owners. Zetta Jet operates solely on their clients’ schedules, giving them the gift of time – time to work, time to play, time to spend with loved ones.\nZetta Jet’s Director of Sales, Matthew Walter explains, “Zetta Jet guests exist in a perpetual balancing act between work, family and entertainment. They long for an extra few hours in the day so they can meet all the demands on their time. At Zetta Jet, we give them those hours.”\nThe only choice for the most discerning traveler\nZetta Jet is set to deliver the ultimate private jet experience for the most discerning of flyers. “Our years of experience have given us an in-depth insight into the needs and desires of the world’s travelling elite. We aim to become the number one choice for clients who seek the very highest level in bespoke travel,” expounds Geoffrey Cassidy, Executive Director at Zetta Jet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:15:18.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
