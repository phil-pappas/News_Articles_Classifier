AFP \nSANTIAGO, Chile – Fifteen former members of Chile’s dictatorship-era secret police must stand trial for the 1976 kidnapping and killing of a Spanish diplomat, the country’s Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. \nProsecutors accuse the secret police of abducting, torturing and killing Carmelo Soria, an official with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America who was found dead inside his car in July 1976. \nInvestigators say Soria was targeted for assassination by late dictator Augusto Pinochet’s regime as a suspected member of Chile’s then-banned communist party. \nCarmelo Soria.
