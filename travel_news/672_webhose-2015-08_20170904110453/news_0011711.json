The answer is track days and driving experiences . As the legendary Silverstone’s track day manager Oliver Wiltshire puts it, “Track days are the perfect setting for any level of driver to safely put your own car through its paces – no oncoming traffic, a full safety and medical team on hand and a fun and friendly atmosphere. Plus, qualified instructors can help hone your ability and understand how to drive your car faster.” Here are five of the UK’s best. Santa Pod RWYB Santa Pod’s “Run What Ya Brung” race days are dedicated to two things: top speed and reaction time. Drivers compete – in a fairly friendly fashion – drag-race style over a quarter-mile straight in whatever car they happen to turn up in, from Dodge pickups to Subaru Imprezas and AMG Mercs. Points are given for the fastest time, highest finishing top speed, and the fastest reaction time off the start line. It’s a straightforward way to get a feel for your car’s performance; just make sure your tyres survive the challenge! • 01234 782828 rwyb.co.uk » Silverstone Track Day In a sport as enormously expensive as Formula One, it seems almost unrealistic that one day a month anyone can turn up and drive the exact same circuit as the likes of Lewis Hamilton, but that’s exactly what Silverstone’s open pit lane track days offer. Any ability is welcome, from those requiring tuition to those who bring their own slicks (only permitted in the dry). You need no qualifications beyond a standard driving licence, but be warned – special insurance will be required. • 0844 3728 235 silverstone.co.uk » Goodwood racecourse When motor racing returned to Britain after the Second World War, it was here, in 1948, at what was then known as RAF Westhampnett, that the first race took place. The 2.4-mile Goodwood circuit held races for 18 years until it closed in 1966. Successive motoring-made generations of the duchy of Richmond turned Goodwood into the petrolheads’ mecca that it is today, however, and since the launch of Goodwood Revival in 1998, track days have been available at the circuit, barely altered from 1948. What better place to bring your own classic to stretch its legs? • 01243 755 055 goodwood.com » WildTracks 4x4 Giving your car a workout doesn’t have to be all about speed.

Home to British Touring Car Championship races, and formerly a British Superbike venue, its two miles of tarmac include a number of challenging corners (most notably the “Jim Clark Esses”). Open pitlane track days start at £179 per car, with tuition available for an extra £20 per driver. • 01325 721815 trackdays.co.uk / croftcircuit.co.uk » The views expressed in this article in connection with the track days are the author’s independent views Do you want to help look after your engine?
