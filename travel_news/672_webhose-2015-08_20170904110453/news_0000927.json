The seal was then thrown out of the water onto the beach, where it died. \nA one-hour swimming suspension was issued for Nauset Light and Coast Guard beach, due to their proximity to each other. Paige Long, a dispatcher with the Cape Cod National Seashore, says that’s standard protocol. \nSeals are a primary food source for great white sharks, which have been spotted in the Cape in increasing numbers over the years.
