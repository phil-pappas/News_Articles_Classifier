Now, the digital marketing agency is being recognized for its innovative approach once again, earning a Silver Stevie® Award in the \"Marketing Campaign of the Year - Automotive - Vehicles\" category of the 2015 International Business Awards™. With the highest score of any U.S. automotive campaign, C-4 Analytics was honored for one particular hypertargeted online strategy that created demand for the 2014 Jeep Cherokee in the Greater Boston market.\nA stylistic departure from the Jeep lineup, the 2014 Cherokee was met with initial skepticism from critics and brand enthusiasts, leaving a multi-brand dealership in Greater Boston with excess inventory. C-4 Analytics employed a multifaceted digital campaign to change buyer opinions and ignite sales, devising separate ad strategies that emphasized the Cherokee's capabilities to existing Jeep fans while attracting conquest buyers who were considering other compact SUVs. The agency's campaign more than doubled web traffic to the dealership's Cherokee-related pages and contributed to a 200 percent month-over-month increase in Cherokee sales, clearing out the excess inventory.\n\"By understanding the psychology of car buyers and leveraging data to precisely target their online behaviors, we're able to transform the complexion of a market, and our award-winning Jeep Cherokee campaign is a perfect example,\" said Justin Cook , vice president and general counsel of C-4 Analytics. \"Not only did we generate an impressive sales boost for a local dealership, but we helped make the Cherokee a segment leader in Greater Boston when many people were saying it wasn't 'Jeep enough.'\"\nThe 2015 International Business Awards™ received more than 3,700 nominations from organizations in more than 60 nations and territories. Stevie® Award winners were determined by the average scores of more than 200 executives worldwide who participated in the judging process from May through early August.\n\"Our latest Stevie® Award is a testament to the fact that our employees are some of the world's smartest, most dedicated digital marketers,\" added Michael Weiss , managing partner of C-4 Analytics. \"Instead of chasing industry standards with our campaigns, we are changing the industry with a forward-looking approach that anticipates and influences consumer behavior.\"\nAbout C-4 Analytics:\nHeadquartered in Saugus, Massachusetts , C-4 Analytics is a top-10 company on Deloitte's 2014 Technology Fast 500, a fastest-growing private company on the Inc. 5000, a certified Google Partner and the first agency to bring accountability to online marketing.
