At times it's confused and hectic, and it's definitely wounded from existing on an economic knife edge, and yet it is also incredibly energetic, pulsating and rapturous. \nHere are the things I learned during my 48 hour affair with BA.. \n1. The architecture is incredibly diverse \nDriving around Buenos Aires is like zooming past many of the world's cities all at once - from the refined French avenues to the rambling, windy Spanish streets and the bright patchwork corrugated iron houses in the port area of La Boca. \nThe Casa Rosada, the government house where Eva Peron immortally stood upon a balcony to deliver her final speech in 1951, is perhaps the most iconic building in Buenos Aires. The pink palace sits in Plaza de Mayo, which has been BA's political and civic heart since 1580. The grand old European-style building has witnessed many sharp manoeuvres in Argentina's erratic democratic history. \nThe Pink Palace that has a bloody history. Photo: iStock. \nBut why is it pink? Some say that in the late 1800s, the building was painted pink to placate the two warring political parties at the time - one of which had red as its colour, the other white. The other oft-touted reason is that the building was originally slapped in both lime and cow's blood in lieu of paint - an ancient and indigenous way of protecting structures from humidity - and then the pink hue just stuck. \n2. Everyone stays up really, really late Ad Feedback \nReset your body clock when you arrive, but make sure to set it on 'night owl', because if you go out for a nice dinner before 9pm you'll find yourself in an empty restaurant. \nSo where to go for dinner? Floreria Atlantico , which is directly opposite the swanky Sofitel on Arroyo Street, is a cavernous eatery and speakeasy-style bar hidden in a basement. It is as hip as it is inconspicuous - you walk through a closed florist to get in. \nWhen I went it was a Sunday night, it was 9.30pm and the glamorous Porteños (the name for folk from BA) were just getting started. I slinked back to my hotel at 11pm, beaten by sleepiness and happily full after gorging on delicious octopus and an Argentinian pinot noir, but the glamorous patrons who were all gesticulating wildly, deep in conversation, looked like they were just getting started. \nFloreria Atlantico - the coolest underground eatery in BA.

Tango isn't all cheesy and touristy \nYes, as you wander through La Boca - the working class area that has become a tourist magnet due to its cobblestone streets and brightly coloured makeshift buildings, you will see men in polyester suits and women in fringed dresses ready to pose for pictures with tourists for a price ... as seen here: \nBut in the middle of the night in Buenos Aires a vibrant and local tango scene comes alive with milongas, which are essentially weekly tango parties that are part-anyone-can-dance, part-demonstration and have their own set of informal but strongly held rules. \nMost milongas don't get interesting until after midnight, but a glimpse into the nocturnal pulse of the city is well worth staying up past your bedtime for. \nAs a stiff Kiwi I was too nervous to head straight into this seemingly sexy world and so opted first for an evening lesson with Lucia & Gerry in San Telmo (a historical area that, with its local characters, great markets and narrow streets, was my favourite neighbourhood in BA, and is definitely worth an explore). \nOn Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays married pair Lucia & Gerry (he's Irish, which I was not expecting) host 'Tango Nights Out' where they teach you the basic steps before taking you to the Maldita Milonga - a moody room where locals and foreigners alike stomp around the dancefloor while onlookers like me watch from the sidelines. \nThe absolute highlight of the night was the live music at the milonga, provided by the dramatic and intense Orquesta Típica El Afronte. I felt like I'd been transported into a key scene in a salacious Pedro Almodovar movie - basically my dream scenario. \nHere's a glimpse of the milonga in question, and the fabulous live music (make sure to book a table by the stage if heading there): \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \n4. Most Porteños don't like the movie Evita \nWhy? Well, as one local said, \"Is it really appropriate to make a movie about a controversial recent political time and make it a musical?\". Well put. \nAlso, Madonna - an American - was cast as one of the most important figures in recent history for most Argentinians, Eva Peron. \nTo add insult to injury, Antonio Banderas - a Spaniard - was cast as Ché Guevara, the country's other most iconic person. (In the movie he lurks around Eva Peron throughout her life as some form of creepy stalker. In real life, the pair never met). \n5. There are hotels you can rent out by the hour - and they're not considered that seedy \nBuenos Aires is teeming with 'love hotels', which locals call 'telos': they're basically rooms that you can rent by the hour for, well, 'love'. \nMany rooms come with their own brand of condoms and sex toys, others hot tubs and mood lighting, while some you can drive straight into with your car so that no one will see you arriving on foot. Prices - and quality - vary wildly, but they're not all seedy, and on weeknights they are a cheap option for the budget-conscious and intrepid traveller. \nWhy do they exist? Well, it's the norm to live with your parents right through your 20s and 30s and until you're married, but Argentines are passionate people. Amorous and socially conservative all at once equals the need for spaces that facilitate secret liaisons. (Also, an Argentine friend told me that fidelity is rare - \"I have millions of stories,\" she whispered when I asked her about love hotels). \nHere's a look at Hotel Rampa Car (where you drive straight to your room and rates start at around NZ$40 for two hours). \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \n6. Coffee isn't their national drink, or even malbec. It's mate. \nI went for the malbec, but I left talking about mate - while every drop of wine I drank in BA was delicious (and I managed to imbibe a plucky amount in 48 hours), it was the bitter, green tea called yerba mate that I found myself more interested in. \nAn incredibly popular hot drink in Argentina - it basically tastes like the most bitter green tea you'll ever sip - the drinking of it is ritualistic and all about hanging out with family (it's often drunk from a gourd through a silver straw and is sipped at a lower temperature than tea, so most kettles in BA have 'mate' settings that boil the water 'till it's just right). \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; \nOh and yes, while in the city you must eat one of the famously succulent steaks - which are delicious, yes, but almost always come unseasoned and with no sauce (I was expecting some chimmichurri-or-the-like on the side, but Porteños let their steak do the talking). \nOh, and warning, you will be offered tripe on many occasions if eating with locals. \nWhile I was anticipating great slabs of protein, I didn't realise that Argentines also consider the carb-offering that is pizza a national dish (which will have something to do with those of Italian descent making up around 60 per cent of the population). All steaked out, my last meal in Buenos Aires was at Pizzeria Güerrin, a bustling diner. The pizza there is thick-based and laden in cheese (the best bit for me was the chickpea pattie you can order as an addition to 'top' your pizza. Delicious). \nThe pizza at Guerrin, did I mention it came with a lot of cheese? Photo: Facebook/PizzeriaGüerrin. \n7. There are professional dog babysitters \nI went to the very European suburb of Recoleta - think the fanciest parts of Paris with elegant iron details and hanging plants on century-old balconies - to visit the fascinating Recoleta Cemetery (a who's-tomb-is-the-biggest? display of posthumous wealth that charts the history of the 'haves' of Argentina). \nWhile the cemetery is a must-visit, the most memorable part of my morning in Recoleta were the next-level dog walkers. \nFirst I saw a man being tangled up by a dancing dachshund, collie, terrier and about seven labradors; then I saw a small woman with enviable biceps confidently strutting down a wide avenue with 20, I kid you not, 20 dogs. \nA study in arm strength: BA's dog walkers. Photo: iStock. \nThe wealthy in Buenos Aires hire certified dog walkers to take their pets out for around three to four hours a day, exercise them, socialise them and get them out of the apartment-bound life most Porteños live. \nA small detail of the city, yes, but the image of one man walking 20 dogs with confidence while women minced past holding Prada handbags, is one of the things I will always remember about this fascinating, sprawling, characterful place. \nThe BA skyline.

You turn up, greenbacks in wallet, only to discover that most people won't take them. \nThis is not the case in BA. Almost everyone accepts US currency and will give you a seriously hefty discount if you offer to pay with it (the only time I was turned down with a dollar in hand was when buying a bottle of water). \nThe hunger for the green stuff stems from the fact that the government has imposed strict currency exchange restrictions on locals. When wandering around touristy areas you'll hear men cry \"CAMBIO, CAMBIO\" like they're trying to sell you copy watches. They're wanting to take your US currency and give you back pesos, at a far better rate than is official. \nI opted out of the back-alley deals, and stuck to giving the US dollars directly to the shopkeepers (which meant beautiful leather belts for the price of a movie ticket in NZ). \n9. New Zealanders can live there for a year \nAbout one in five Argentines listed off names of key All Blacks - past and present - when I revealed myself as a Kiwi. I was also told that whenever the All Blacks visit they're revered like gods (which I'm sure they love). \nAnton Oliver hanging out in Plaza de Mayo square (the civic centre of BA) back in 2006. Photo: Getty Images. \nI also learnt that NZ and Argentina have a reciprocal working holiday visa programme that means New Zealanders aged 18-30 can live there for a year, and Argentines can live over here for a year. \nApparently the flow of people has been almost exclusively one way due to the low value of the peso (the website catering to Argentines wanting to go to NZ crashed due to overloading when first launched), but if you're willing to forego savings for a year and learn tango, go to football matches and teach your body how to stay up past the usual Kiwi bedtime of 10pm, life in BA could be for you. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:40:19.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
