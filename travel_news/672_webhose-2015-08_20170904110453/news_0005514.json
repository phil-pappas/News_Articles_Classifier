Skiing in New Zealand is a popular holiday for Aussies. Source: Supplied \nDAYS after Virgin Australia announced plans to ramp up flights to New Zealand, Qantas has hit back — in the clearest sign yet it’s again “game on” between the two carriers. \nThe Flying Kangaroo will operate an additional 95 flights from Brisbane to Wellington and Christchurch between December and February to meet school holiday demand. \nQantas has also announced a fifth weekly flight between Sydney and Jakarta and daily services between Perth and Singapore in the holiday period, to give customers “more choice”. Land of the long white cloud ... Qantas will be an even more regular visitor to New Zealand in the summer holiday period.
