This was announced by the Tourist Guide Taskforce, comprising the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Singapore Tourism Board (STB), at a media briefing this afternoon.\nThe TG Taskforce and ensuing initiatives follow the implementation of the STB Amendment Act in October 2014, and are part of Government’s ongoing efforts to raise the professionalism of tourist guides and the quality of tourist guiding in Singapore.\nThe new initiatives are developed based on extensive industry engagement and studies by the TG Taskforce. Areas covered include enhancing the pre-licensing training and assessment process for tourist guides, advancing their professional development and giving greater recognition for experience and excellence. This is to help TGs enhance their knowledge and skill sets to adapt to the changing tourism landscape, to meet the needs of our discerning visitors, and to support our drive towards quality tourism growth.\nTo further support the TG profession, the Society of Tourist Guides (Singapore) (STGS) has been awarded STB’s Association Development Fund (ADF) to help drive their plans for a three-year period.\nEnhanced Pre-Licensing Training and Assessment Process\nFrom 2016, prospective TGs can look forward to a more comprehensive and streamlined training curriculum targeted at equipping them with the relevant and applicable skillsets to carry out guiding services effectively. There will be more practical training hours to hone their guiding skills, e-learning modules to learn at their convenience, and new modules to ensure breadth and depth of knowledge.\n“With these recommendations in place, there will be more opportunities for local TGs to not just be better equipped with professional skillsets but also achieve better career growth in the long run. TGs can also explore various initiatives under SkillsFuture to deepen their skills, become masters of their craft and enhance Singapore’s competitiveness as a tourism destination of choice,” says Ms Janice Foo, Director, Tourism Division, Singapore Workforce Development Agency.\nContinuous Professional Development\nA wider spectrum of professional development courses (PDCs) will be introduced as part of post-licence training to enable licensed TGs to upskill themselves to better meet the evolving needs of our travellers.\nMr Gilbert Tan, Chief Executive Officer of e2i (Employment and Employability Institute) said, “e2i has been working closely with our partners to identify and develop courses to equip our local tourist guides with useful and requisite skill sets and knowledge to deliver quality guiding services and improve their employability. We welcome this re-structured pre- and post-licensing training which can set the stage for a clearer progression pathway and better recognition of skills achieved.”\nRecognition of Experience and Excellence\nTo recognize and appreciate TGs’ contribution to Singapore’s tourism industry, TGs with extensive experience and who have exemplified quality guiding services will be given Long Service and Quality of Guiding awards. Starting in 2016, these will be given out at an annual award ceremony in the form of customized pin badges, which can be worn when they are guiding. Beyond the recognition of their achievements, this will also encourage the guiding profession to continue with their passion and efforts to enhance the visitors’ overall experience, through good service delivery and high quality of guiding.\n“With ever more discerning travellers who prefer in-depth experiences of the destination, TGs who are experienced, able to provide bespoke services or have expertise in different interest areas are now more sought after. Tourist guides are integral to the tourism landscape and tell the Singapore story to our visitors, and we want to acknowledge them for their contributions” says Ms Ong Ling Lee, Director, Travel Agents and Tourist Guides, Singapore Tourism Board.\nFunding support for the Society of Tourist Guides (Singapore) (STGS)\nTo further grow the profession, STB has awarded STGS an ADF grant for them to implement their three year plan from 2015 to 2018. The ADF supports tourism-related associations by strengthening their capabilities to enable them to take on a greater leadership role to drive the development and growth of their respective industries and precincts.\nOver the three years, the STGS will use the grant to focus on training and development initiatives to help their members enhance their knowledge and skills, and market their services for better employability. The grant will also enable the Society to take a greater role in growing the professionalism of TGs.\n“With funding support, the Society currently run by tourist guides can now focus more on the needs of our members. We will be engaging full-time professionals to execute our numerous projects, which include plans for training and the use of technology to market the services of our guides”, says Mr Howard Lim, Chairman, Society of Tourist Guides (Singapore).\nSource:- Singapore Tourism Board", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:32:41.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
