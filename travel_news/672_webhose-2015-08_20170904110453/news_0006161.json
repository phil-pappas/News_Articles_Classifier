This is a full €40 euros more than the next most expensive marina, Marina Grande in Capri, Italy. Both marinas are notable for their highly limited number of berths. \nFurther down the list, marinas in Italy and Spain continue to feature most prominently, with Ibiza Magna and Marina di Porto Cervo in Sardinia in third and fourth place respectively. Meanwhile in tenth place is Marina di Portofino in Italy, which charges a comparatively modest €56 euros a night, perhaps due to the fact that there are several other marinas along the Italian northwest coast. \nThe survey also serves to demonstrate the enduring popularity of the West Mediterranean as a yachting destination, with only marinas in Croatia and Turkey featuring in the top 10 from outside this region of Europe. \nAccording to Nicole Haney from TravelMag.com, while other areas of the world are increasingly opening up to yachting visitors, the West Med will always hold a strong appeal to traditionalists. \n“Our survey has produced some interesting results, but it’s no surprise to see the West Med dominating,” he said. \n“There is still nowhere to match the Italian Riviera or Cote d’Azur for history, while the Spanish islands can offer all-year-round sunshine and beautiful scenery.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:08:25.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
