That’s important and America has an obligation to show leadership in the troubled region.\nIt’s also instructive to learn which candidates are likely to repeat our terrible mistakes and ignore lessons we should have learned about the futility of military solutions to problems in a place defined by ancient religious rivalries.\nBut voters need to know where candidates stand on other overseas challenges the country will face in 2016 and beyond.\nChina now tops that list. Maintaining positive relations with this restless frenemy will have a much greater bearing on America’s economic security and long-term prosperity.\nThe ascendant superpower is undergoing a transition. It’s enjoying new levels of wealth and global influence. Yet its leaders are struggling to maintain the country’s remarkable economic growth — growth that has also maintained internal stability.\nWith China’s rise has come disconcerting nationalism. China is aggressively challenging borders in the Pacific, rattling U.S. allies in the region and testing boundaries drawn after World World II.\nThe U.S. response — including concerns expressed in May by U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter — has been outwardly dismissed by Chinese authorities and has stoked anti-Western sentiment in the country.\nChina’s move this month to devalue its currency is also troubling. Rising wages were opening the door for the United States and other countries to expand manufacturing and compete. But that door will be slammed shut if China further manipulates its currency to maintain its cost advantage.\nThat follows China’s moves to dissuade use of American technology products and turn to domestic suppliers, purportedly because of security concerns.\nInstead of discussing how to win manufacturing back from China, increase trade and create jobs, politicians rail on about the boogeyman of illegal immigration.” These moves affect the scarcity of jobs in America and the middle class’ sense of falling behind, which remain top concerns of voters .\nYet instead of discussing how to win manufacturing back from China, increase trade and create jobs, politicians rail on about the boogeyman of illegal immigration — the rate of which has leveled of f.\nCandidates should also stop threatening to start another terrible, misguided war in the Persian Gulf. Instead, tell voters how America can respond to China’s apparent intrusion into government computers and personnel files. Not to mention new revelations that Chinese security services are secretly operating on U.S. soil and harassing expatriates.\nPerhaps candidates would focus more on Asia-Pacific issues if Washington, Oregon and California would get their act together with presidential primaries. All three states hold their primaries late, long after the March runoffs elsewhere in the country. The timing diminishes the influence these trade-oriented states have on campaigns.\nEven so, the growing importance of China to the entire country demands that presidential candidates discuss the Middle Kingdom as well as the Middle East.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
