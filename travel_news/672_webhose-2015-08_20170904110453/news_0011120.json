She’s having a shower. She’s cleaning her teeth.” While Corina didn’t recognise the voice, it felt as if this woman was in the same room. Except of course that she wasn’t.\n“It was a very strange experience,” Corina says, “at that stage I couldn’t make any sense of it.”\nOther Stories We need a miracle for our baby to live Nsw 0 comments 15 years on, Bilal Skaf unrepentant Special Features 0 comments The sweet smell of success for Depp Sunday Style 0 comments Claims Salim did not disclose property interests Nsw Home bought for $23,000 sells for $3m News ’The best and worst day of our lives’ Nsw 0 comments Initially the voice 44-year-old Corina first heard back in November 2012 wasn’t a negative one, so she decided to “just put up with it, basically.”\nBut things were about to get much harder.\n“By March the following year I had three voices, and visions as well,” Corina says.\n“I had a female voice which was really derogatory and abusive. I had a male voice, which demanded I do random tasks. I had a another female voice which was the voice of a Buddhist nun,” she explains.\nThe voice that set Corina tasks would say things like: “Empty out the linen cupboard and repack it.”\n“Initially I didn’t do it. I just thought he was just being silly, but later on I found that it had a purpose,” she says.\nPerhaps the most alarming of her visitors is a character Corina calls “Drop Dead Fred” who manifests as “a visual hallucination that I get, where people I’m looking at turn into skeletons and I see all their innards and gizzards.”\nThe voices and hallucinations had such an impact on day-to-day life, that she was forced to give up studying event management.\n“Sixty per cent of the time I had the voices just going off. That took all my effort just to address them.\n“I ended up in hospital, and from there I started getting the help that I needed,” Corina says.\nKath Sellick is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Social Work at the University of Melbourne. She’s been working with voice hearers for seven years.\nBoth Corina and Ms Sellick presented sessions on voice hearing at the mental health focused “ TheMHS Conference ,” in Canberra this week.\nMs Sellick says “between two and eight per cent of the general population have at some point heard voices external to themselves.”\nBased on this, up to 1.9 million Australians or 1 in 13 people have experienced voice hearing.\nDespite its prevalence, Ms Sellick says people find it “shameful” to discuss because it’s “very stigmatised.”\nTraditionally, she explains, “mainstream psychiatry tries to get rid of voices and it usually does so through medications.”\nShe points out that long-term use of antipsychotic drugs can have serious side effects and may not actually fix the problem.\nThis is where the so-called “ Hearing Voices Approach ” comes in. Developed in the Netherlands in the late 1980s, it stems from the belief that the voices have meaning to the person hearing them and that it’s possible to find strategies to cope.\nA key facet of learning to live with the voices, Ms Sellick says, is “actually engaging with them” because then “you can get a better sense of what they represent in your life.”\nGiving the example of voice-hearing man and mental health advocate Ron Coleman who was sexually abused as a child, Ms Sellick explains: “One of his voices was of his abuser.”\n“The research is suggesting that there is certainly a link between trauma, such as childhood sexual abuse, and psychosis.\n“Many PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] sufferers do report hearing voices as well,” Ms Sellick says.\nCorina is a case-in-point. She suffered abuse as a child at the hands of a family friend and suffers from PTSD because of it.\n“The guilt and the shame’s probably the hardest part that I had to learn to deal with, and that’s still a work in progress,” she says.\nReflecting on the voices she started hearing nearly 30 years after the abuse took place, Corina is certain they are “a manifestation of unresolved emotion.”\nLuckily, she happened upon a “liberal” psychologist who was willing to embark “on this journey together.”\nCorina believes not all mental health professionals are so open-minded.\n“At times they can be very quick to put someone in a box and label them, rather than looking at the underlying cause,” she says.\nAccording to data emerging from Ms Sellick’s research, mental health professionals may neglect to ask their voice-hearing clients if they have suffered past trauma.\n“Thirty per cent of mental health professionals said that they do regularly ask voice hearers about trauma, which means that 70 per cent aren’t regularly asking,” she says.\nCorina, who is heavily involved in support group Hearing Voices Network WA, urges other voice hearers to “have hope that recovery is possible.”\nHowever she also makes it clear that “recovery” doesn’t necessarily mean the voices ever go away.\n“It’s not about getting rid of the voices, but changing the relationship with them. Changing the balance power away from the voices and back to yourself,” Corina says.\nCorina has found it helps to engage with the voices, rather than get rid of them. Photo: Ginger Gorman This is exactly the point she has come to her own life. She understands who all her voices are and how they help “make sense” of her trauma. Each voice even has a name.\nAside from Drop Dead Fred, Corina tells me there’s Silvia who is mean and critical, Norjin the Buddhist nun, Jonathan the taskmaster and Jack — a character who Corina originally thought “was trying to kill me” but now acts as a mentor.\nWhile dealing with the voices in public can sometime be tough, Corina uses meditation and conversation techniques to deal with the intruders.\n“I feel I’m in control. I’m no longer threatened or frightened by the voices,” she says.\nIf you have survived sexual abuse and hear voices or you are a mental health professional, you can participate in Ms Sellick’s research .\nVoice hearers or their loved ones can connect with Hearing Voices Network Australia .\nGinger Gorman is an award winning print and radio journalist, and a 2006 World Press Institute Fellow.
