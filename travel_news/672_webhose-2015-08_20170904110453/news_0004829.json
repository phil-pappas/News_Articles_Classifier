The company’s increase with regard to international passengers was once again in July, higher than the market average contributing thus actively to Greek tourism and economy.\nSpecifically, in July 2015, the company carried 1,473,568 passengers, 240 thousand more compared to July 2014, recording a 19% increase of the overall passenger traffic.\nAEGEAN NETWORK OVERALL TRAFFIC – JULY 2015\nJULY 2015 JULY 2014 CHANGE % OVERALL TRAFFIC WITHIN GREECE 665.118 602.260 10% OVERALL INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC 808.450 631.090 28% OVERALL NETWORK TRAFFIC 1.473.568 1.233.350 19% INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC\nJULY 2015 JULY 2014 CHANGE % ATHENS BASE 453.327 330.430 37% HERAKLION BASE 123.684 94.808 30% RHODES BASE 58.212 50.515 15%\nIncrease in international flights was particularly high, 28% higher than July 2014, for all 9 bases of the company in Athens, Thessaloniki, Heraklion, Chania, Rhodes, Corfu, Kalamata, Kos and Larnaka. International passenger traffic to Athens was highest in 2015, reaching 37% and 808,450 passengers, due to the company’s 16 new destinations such as Oslo, Helsinki, Malta, Dubrovnik, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Alexandria, Riyadh and Tehran. International traffic increase to Heraklion base was also significant, reaching 30%, while traffic increase to Rhodes Base reached 15%. Such performance was positive for the company, given that the overall market to these destinations showed a small decline in the first half of 2015, mainly because of Russia.\nThe company’s reaction and activation with regard to the flights within Greece was also of great significance, since long-standing capital controls and bank closure limited to a great extent Greeks’ buying capacity and domestic tourism, which mainly supports smaller islands. AEGEAN achieved a traffic increase of 10% compared to July 2014. The increase was achieved with continuous promotions, more than in any other year, so that Greek passengers are able to go on holidays despite the difficult conditions. Increase of traffic to public service obligation destinations was even higher, since those destinations were supported this year with more flights and enhanced international connectivity and achieved an increase of 25%, while certain of those destinations show an even higher rate of increase.\nPASSENGER TRAFFIC INCREASE PERCENTAGE 2015 COMPARED TO 2014 IKARIA 40% KARPATHOS 27% MILOS 46% NAXOS 39% SKIATHOS 55% ZAKYNTHOS 53% Mr Dimitris Gerogiannis, AEGEAN’s CEO stated:\n“AEGEAN, contributes with all its forces in order to support our country in these difficult circumstances, as well as to maintain its own growth potential. There are great challenges and difficulties, but tourism can once again become a driver for recovery and it should be supported. AEGEAN operating in 134 destinations in 45 countries, increasing thus Greece’s accessibility and fulfilling a targeted offer programme, managed to increase traffic to our country, as well as domestic tourism to small islands that are especially dependent on it”.\nSource:- Aegean Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:15:43.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
