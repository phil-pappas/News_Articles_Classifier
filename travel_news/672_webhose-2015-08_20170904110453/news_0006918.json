Economy. Up the back, on the right, in the aisle beside two very tall men. \nTIME IN THE AIR 12 hours and 15 minutes. \nTHE SEAT STUFF 83cm pitch with a 15cm recline, in-seat power and a USB connection. \nBAGGAGE ALLOWANCE Business class passengers are allowed up to three pieces, with a maximum weight of 23 kilograms. Economy passengers can take a single checked piece, up to 23 kilograms. \nCOMFORT FACTOR Unfortunately, my comfort factor was not high on this trip. I'm quite tall and my knees pushed against the back of the seat in front of me. Thankfully I was in the aisle seat so I could dangle my legs and arms into the walkway through the night. The adjustable head-rest was useful to stop my head from lolling sideways and bothering my neighbour mid-sleep. \nTHAT'S ENTERTAINMENT The in-flight entertainment was excellent, with local New Zealand drama, HBO television series' and new release movies on offer. There were more than 1800 titles all up, including movies, TV shows, radio shows, and audio books, as well as a wide selection of games. You can also order snacks, hot and cold drinks, and alcoholic beverages via the seatback screen. Ad Feedback \nTHE SERVICE Friendly and efficient. My midnight requests for green tea, snacks and a sneaky red wine were delivered in record time. \nFEEDING TIME For dinner I picked braised beef with green beans, which was accompanied by cheese and crackers, a slightly scary pasta salad, and a Kapiti ice-cream. It was pretty tasty, if slightly generic. \nONE MORE THING The in-flight ordering via the seatback system is great. Using the touch-screen, you can request such goodies as eye masks, Cookie Time biscuits or a gin and tonic, even when the rest of the cabin is fast asleep. \nTHE VERDICT Friendly and reliable, this was overall a great trip. The lack of comfort is to be expected in economy class on a 12 hour trip and was made up for by the excellent in-flight entertainment system. \nFREQUENCY Air New Zealand flies from Auckland to San Francisco once daily. \nClio Francis flew courtesy of Air New Zealand. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:35:22.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
