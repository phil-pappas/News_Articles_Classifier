They really push their luck because they go too close to the water. They don’t look at the big waves coming regularly. It looks OK the next thing your gone,” he said. \n“You don’t wish that to happen to anyone. We come with metal plates on our shoes they come in thongs on the moss, it’s slimy. \n“There is a sign but I think they should put it in different languages, particularly Chinese.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:14.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
