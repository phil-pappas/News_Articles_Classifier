I should know: I founded one and failed. \nAfter licking my wounds, I realized that I could still be a self-starter. While working at an investment bank, I traveled the world helping the firm to grow its revenue in new markets. \nWith all the time on the road, I found time to write a book on money , and my paycheck helped me to finance my other interests. Instead of being a classic \"entrepreneur,\" I was an \" intrapreneur ,\" someone who builds within an established organization, or uses his or her paycheck to finance other interests.

You'll receive a biweekly influx of capital to spend as you choose: buying groceries, donating to charities, or investing in your (or your friend's) start-up company. \nBehind every successful start-up company is a group of angel investors also known as intrapreneurs. They work traditional jobs at investment banks, law firms and fax machine companies. Usually they're top performers, making enough discretionary income that they can invest in other ventures. \nSara Blakely , the founder of SPANX , was an intrapreneur before she was an entrepreneur. She worked as a fax machine salesperson in Florida and noticed that traditional pantyhose didn't work well with her open-toe sandals. This gave her the idea for SPANX, a hosiery and slimming undergarment company. But she didn't quit her job -- at least, not at first. Her job helped her cover some of the initial costs of her company. This went on for years until she resigned two weeks before SPANX was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show . \nStarting a company isn't for the faint of heart. Not everyone can raise millions of dollars in seed capital, so you will likely be on your own. An intrapreneur knows that he or she doesn't have to leave a steady-paying job to invest in a company or start one. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T19:59:36.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
