Famous for its short-term delights, there I was in hot Las Vegas, exhausted and laden with luggage after a long flight, and then … there she was.\nDressed in red, she had curves in all the right places. Las Vegas had delivered on its promise of a beautiful escort to help me explore the bright lights and beyond. Picking up my hot- red convertible Volkswagen from Advantage Car Rentals was a seamless experience after a long flight from Australia and this gorgeous car had me wanting to hit the road immediately, to break the lure of the glitzy Strip and seek out Mother Nature’s finest spectacles in southern Nevada.\nMy mission was daily road trips up to an hour away before retreating to the luxuries of the famous Strip for world-class food and entertainment at night.\nWay to relax ... the penthouse master room at the Delano in Las Vegas. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nFirst stop was a 15-minute drive from the airport to my base camp for the week, the stylish Delano hotel at the Mandalay Bay complex. The all-suite boutique hotel’s floor-to-ceiling windows offer endless views of the city and with a location at the southern end of the Strip, Delano serves as an ideal place from which to explore the best of both worlds.\nSoon after a quick freshen up I was out the door like a rattle snake slithering through the Mojave sands. In the lift I greeted a bling-ed up and mannequin-esque Pamela Anderson with a courteous nod (though it may well have been a mannequin) and jumped in the VDub. That was the daily routine for the days ahead. Try these day trips for size.\nRoad tripping ... to the Red Rock Canyon. Picture: Scott Podmore Source: Supplied\nEscape No.1\nRed Rock Canyon\n(25 minutes)\nConditions are hot and dry in summer so load up on bottles of water provided free at Delano’s valet. The fast pace of the Strip quickly subsides once out on the highway as scenery smacks you in the senses. Copper-coloured mountains leap out from the desert floor highlighted by Red Rock Canyon’s bluffs, cliffs and petrified sandstone boulders.\nTime really does stand still out here. These mountains were formed by geological forces including fractured faults where the earth’s crust collided over millions of years and fossilised sand dunes. Some cliffs reach a kilometre high. It really is breathtaking. The 20km round-trip tourist route at the actual site is a must-do.\nThe return: Tom Colicchio’s Heritage Steak at The Mirage\nChef Tom’s game plan is about meats prepared entirely over an open flame from charcoal grills to wood-burners. A smooth-talking and well presented floor team raises the bar and the food is killer melt-in-the mouth Wagyu beef, scallops the size of baseballs and pork belly so tender you could cry. There’s heart in the mission, too: Colicchio only chooses antibiotic-free meat from farmers committed to time-honoured farming practices and heritage breeds. Big tick.\nMore: mirage.com/restaurants\nSpectacular ... houseboats can be rented on man-made Lake Mead. Picture: Scott Podmore Source: Supplied\nEscape No.2\nLake Mead and Callville Bay Resort & Marina\n(45 minutes)\nMonster-sized man-made Lake Mead is a major recreation area in addition to being a major water artery for the region, originally formed by the building of Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in 1935. Callville Bay Resort and Marina hums with houseboats, jet skis, and speed boats. The big drawcard is the ultimate houseboat adventures on offer providing a visual feast of desert/water contrasts, mountains and canyons. All Forever Houseboat rentals include a waterside, barbecue, kitchen and a top\ndeck with canopy; deluxe widescreen TVs and stainless steel kitchens. Wildlife comes out to play up around the banks and I was lucky to get close to a coyote, eagles, mallards, grebes and hummingbirds. If you’re lucky, a bighorn sheep may wander down for a drink.\nMore: callvillebay.com/rentals/Forever\nThe return: Lago at Bellagio\nSo much to choose from ... the Lago at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nThe new Lago by Julian Serrano at Bellagio sparkles with opulence. The journey to reach the restaurant alone is dreamy as you pass Bellagio’s Conservatory & Botanical Gardens summer display with vibrant ocean scenes and gazillions of fresh florals.\nThe exhibit combines iconic underwater and beach elements including mermaids, sunken ships and sandcastles, cascading water walls and more.\nTurning the tables on traditional big family serves, Lago’s Italian small plates take the spotlight as Spanish super chef Serrano dishes up daring and more-ish interpretations of Italian, each stacked with knockout flavours. Tip: Get a seat on the outdoor patio to absorb surreal views of the Fountains of Bellagio.\nMore: bellagio.com/restaurants\nMassive area ... The famous Hoover Dam. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nEscape No.3\nHoover Dam\nLet’s see, we’re back in 1929 in a harsh climate, remote location and facing solid rock. So why not build a massive arch-gravity dam? Something with 2.4 million cubic metres of concrete, spillways, the lot? Crazy but brilliant, and also serving the dual purpose of being a film set for great flicks such as Transformers and more recently San Andreas . The sheer size of this man-made but essential engineering masterpiece really is hard to put into words, so taking a guided tour of the powerplant and passageways within Hoover Dam itself is highly recommended to gain an understanding of the purpose this mighty Nevada icon serves.\nMore : Hoover Dam\nThe return: Boulder Brewing Co\nThe must stop-off point in the small township of Boulder is where the craft beers are cold and tasty and the atmosphere warm and addictive.\nPractically a museum in itself, Boulder Dam Brewing Co is a few minutes down the road on the return to Vegas. Mementos such as axes, picks and gauges used in the construction of the dam adorn the inside walls and in the beer garden.\nOwner Lisa Combs says the brewpub is Boulder City’s hot spot for music which can be “anything from bluegrass to rock ’n’ roll and old-fashioned country”. Get stuck into the food menu, too, which is a mix of naughty but nice treats including battered pickles and cheese-loaded pretzels, burgers, salads and pub fare.\nThe beers, of course, are the focal point. Boulder Dam Brewing Co brews everything from European pilsners to happy pale ales to rich, creamy stouts.\nAmazing rock formations ... the Valley of Fire State Park. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nEscape No.4\nValley of Fire\n(60 minutes)\nSeek out Pink Jeep tours, an institution in Vegas, for a small group tour through the mesmerising Valley Of Fire, Nevada’s oldest state park, with entertaining and informed commentary along the way. The park earnt its name from its fiery red sandstone, formed from fossilised sand dunes more than 150 million years ago by a shift in the Earth’s crust, faulting and wind and water erosion.\nToday, only wild animals dwell within Valley of Fire year-round. Rattlesnakes, kangaroo rats, kit foxes, coyotes, bighorn sheep and the white-tailed antelope ground squirrels are just a few. Oh, and cougars, of course, “but only at night”, as my highly entertaining guide Mike Franklin pointed out, “as opposed to the Strip – these particular cougars are hard to spot given they’re minus the bright red lipstick and high heels.”\nSee the sunrise ... in the Valley of Fire. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nMore: pinkjeeptours.com\nThe return: Order in at Delano\nA long hot day in the sun exploring the Valley of Fire couldn’t end any better way than a long soak in your double spa and ordering in at Delano.\nOf course, for those daring enough, try your luck in the adjoining casino at Mandalay Bay and, who knows, you just may find a way to cover the whole Vegas experience … or make it more expensive.\nMore: delanolasvegas.com\nGo2\nLAS VEGAS\nGETTING THERE\nFlight Centre has return airfares to Las Vegas from about $1100 with Delta/Virgin Australia.
