General Manager Rory MacAleece has enlisted an enthusiastic team of employees from the local area to work at the 101-bedroom hotel, which is set to open in the autumn. The new ibis Styles Glasgow Centre George Square Hotel will breathe new life into the formerly vacant Telfer House building in the Merchant City, which has undergone a £7m refurbishment. \nThe UK’s largest independent hotel management company, Redefine|BDL Hotels, which currently manages 69 properties across the UK, will operate the hotel and was responsible for hiring the new team. A mixture of full and part time positions including roles in the front of house, housekeeping, waiting and maintenance teams were filled following a recent recruitment drive. Rory, a proven hotelier with more than 20 years’ experience at the helm of several prestigious four and star venues including the Chester Residence, said: “I believe we have found the best team that Glasgow has to offer and we are all relishing the chance to make this internationally-branded hotel a huge success. “With a fantastic combination of experience with enthusiasm, we are extremely confident that we can build a hotel that will quickly become a much loved venue in Glasgow’s vibrant Merchant City. “Guest satisfaction is of the utmost importance to me. From day one, I want to ensure that guests are left smiling from ear to ear by the experience we have to offer.” Other recruits include Deputy General Manager Ross Saunders, who has previously held senior positions at both Radisson Blu and Park Inn by Radisson hotels in Glasgow. Working under Rory and Ross will be Front Office Manager Carly McGrain, Revenue Manager Julian Punch and Night Manager Craig Adams. Robert Ionesw, David Bruce, Ewan Campbell and Sally Mcintyre have been appointed as Guest Service Agents, while Rachel Harrow will be responsible for reservations. ibis Styles Hotels are renowned for telling the individual stories of their home cities and the Glasgow hotel will be no different. The contemporary interior has been designed with a Glaswegian personality firmly in mind, including tributes to the Duke of Wellington’s infamous cone hat, Buchanan Street’s instantly recognisable Police Box and Tunnock’s Teacakes.
