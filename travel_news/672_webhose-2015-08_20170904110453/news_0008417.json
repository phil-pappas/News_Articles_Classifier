Sometime in the future it might shuffle off all the way to Buffalo. The news kickstarted the idea of a return trip for me to the Falls. It’s the ultimate daily double. In a single day you can combine Canada’s most popular attraction (12 million visitors every year, over half a million litres of raging water surging over the brink every second!), with some terrific golf courses.\nLand of legends\nAt the top of the list of Niagara must plays are the three courses operated by Niagara Parks. Legends on the Niagara includes two eighteen hole layouts, designed by the two best architects in Canada. After winning the coin toss, Doug Carrick designed the Battlefield Course, which curls around a War of 1812 site. It is a typical high-quality Carrick design—heavy on the fescue and deep bunkers with a 19-acre pond providing the water holes. Tom McBroom designed the Ussher’s Creek loop, a more traditional, more subtle layout that uses the creek as a risk/reward barrier.\nStan’s last stand\nStanley Thompson was Canada’s most famous course architect, designer of treasures like Banff, Jasper, Highlands Links and St. Georges. His last great project was Whirlpool in Niagara Falls. The course boasts a stunning Hollywood-style backdrop which includes the Niagara River whirlpool rapids and gorge.\nGreen game\nPeninsula Lakes Golf Club in Fenwick is one of Canadian golf’s original environmental success stories. The club was built on a former sand and gravel quarry that was eating into the edges of the Niagara Escarpment but now is an oasis of green. The original course which was designed by Rene Muylaert has been divided into the Quarry and Hillside nines. The Orchard nine holes was added about 15 years ago.\nLong John’s Canadian adventure\nWhile it’s hard to believe today, at one time Long John Daly garnered nearly as many headlines as Tiger Woods. In the buttoned-down world of golf, Daly was an unlikely folk hero, as famous for his battles with his ex-wives and waistline as for his wins at the British Open and PGA Championship. Teaming up with Canadian architect Bo Danoff, Daly designed Thundering Waters, which sits just a couple of grip it and rip it drives away from the Falls. The majority of the course cuts through corridors of hardwood trees but also opens up to more exposed, British Open style holes that are dusted with fescue and lined with mounds.\nKeeping up with Jones’s\nRees Jones is part of golf’s royal family. His father was the game’s most prolific designer and his older brother was the man behind the controversial Chambers Bay Golf Club, recent host of the US Open. Rees though may be the most talented. A Yale and Harvard graduate, Jones was the architect behind Grand Niagara. Although just 10 years old, the handsome course feels like it’s been around for decades and is one of the best conditioned courses anywhere.\nJust the facts\nThere are a variety of stay and play packages available for the Falls including The Classic, which starts at $209 and includes one round of golf at Legends on the Niagara and one round at Whirlpool and a night of accommodation at the Best Western Plus Cairn Croft. www.niagaraparksgolf.com , 1-866-465-3642\nIan Cruickshank is a Toronto based writer who has been chasing the little white ball around the globe for 25 years.
