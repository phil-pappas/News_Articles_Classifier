What I didn’t eat much of was Cambodian food. As the jumping off point for Angkor Wat, Siem Reap (pronounced SEE-ehm REE-uhp), Cambodia ’s second-largest city, has long catered to international appetites. Yet it’s only relatively recently that visitors keen to explore local dishes have been able to do so beyond street stalls and mediocre buffets.\n“Real Cambodian cuisine is something that most average tourists, who see the same five dishes again and again, rarely experience,” said Joannès Rivière, a French chef who, with his partner, Carole Salmon, opened Cuisine Wat Damnak , serving modern Cambodian food, in 2011.\nBack then Mr. Rivière was the only chef in town using local ingredients to prepare dishes undiluted for foreign palates. Now, thanks to a growing number of restaurants opened by ethnically Khmer (as opposed to Vietnamese-Cambodian or Chinese-Cambodian) chefs and restaurateurs, that’s changed.\nPhoto Lotus salad at Khmer Touch Cuisine. Credit David Hagerman for The New York Times Cambodian food is “first and foremost a cuisine of place,” Mr. Rivière said, rooted in indigenous ingredients: pond frogs and fish from Tonle Sap, the freshwater lake not far from the city; rhizomes and herbs like galangal, turmeric, lemongrass and basil; palm sugar; coconut milk; prahok (salted fermented fish that is boiled to make a sort of stock or chopped fine); and a range of seasonal farmed and foraged fruits and vegetables, like young green jackfruit and wild mango kernels.\nSpice pastes called kroeung are building blocks for many dishes. Basic preparations include khaw, in which caramelized palm sugar coats meat or seafood; soups called samlor (sweet or sour, made with prahok and sometimes coconut milk) and sgnaow (light broths flavored with prahok or fish sauce); and dips featuring prahok, eaten with fresh and blanched vegetables.\nThe following four restaurants range in ambience from basic to fancy. Some offer faithful renditions of Cambodian classics while others serve contemporary interpretations of them. Taken together, they offer a deep dive into one of Southeast Asia’s lesser-known cuisines, one that is all too often unfairly reduced to comparisons with those of its neighbors.\nChanrea Dom Makara The fan-cooled dining room could do with a lick of paint, tables are clad in vinyl, paper napkins litter the floor and the kitchen wears a veneer of grease. Orders are served on plastic tableware and plunked unceremoniously in front of diners. Consider it all a blessing: at 10-year-old Chanrea Dom Makara there is no flash to distract from the delights on your plate.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Chanrea’s inexpensive offerings may be everyday fare for the average Cambodian, but there’s a deft hand in the kitchen. Grab a seat, order some ice-cold coconut water (served in an actual coconut) and mine the menu by flipping past the pages of Chinese-style stir-fries to the Cambodian section. Start, perhaps, with prahok ktis (“Cambodian cheese,” the menu says), an addictive dip that balances prahok’s sometimes off-putting pungency with fatty minced pork and spicy kroeung. Tiny pea eggplants burst between the teeth, providing a jolt of bitterness to awaken a palate lulled by coconut cream.\nGreen mango and smoked fish salad is a common dish in Siem Reap, but in Chanrea’s version the fish almost disintegrates into the dressing of lime juice and fish sauce, giving the salad a texture akin to that of a creamy-crunchy slaw.\nIf Cambodia has a famous dish it’s probably amok, which usually takes the form of a blandish coconut-curry steamed custard similar to Thailand’s hawmawk. Chanrea’s version mingles rafts of fish or chicken with brilliant green neu leaves from an evergreen shrub whose fruit is juiced as a health tonic. Their sweet-bitter flavor and collard-greens-like heft hold their own in the spicy turmeric-forward coconut sauce. (“If there’s no neu it’s not amok,” Mr. Rivière told me.)\nThe menu includes a list of samlor, those prahok-based soups. Some are light, clear and sweet, some sharpened with green tomatoes or lime leaves and redolent of galangal and Thai basil, others thickened with coconut milk and flavored with kroeung. “Dried fish with watermelon” is just that. Like the restaurant, the dish has no frills — simply alternating bites of sweet, juicy fruit and salty, chewy umami bombs.\nSivutha Boulevard (close to Kentucky Fried Chicken); no phone. An average meal for two, without drinks or tip, is about $18. (Dollars are preferred almost everywhere in Siem Reap.)\nRohatt Cafe When Phyreak Hang and his partners were developing the menu for Rohatt, he sought help from relatives in Siem Reap.\n“We wanted to make the food as authentic as possible, even if foreigners wouldn’t eat it,” said Mr. Hang, a Phnom Penh architect who designed his two-year-old timber restaurant to resemble a Khmer-style home.\nRohatt’s look sends up made-for-tourists red flags: spacious, tastefully furnished dining rooms; tree-shaded balconies overlooking the river; a bakery counter displaying muffins and croissants; dishes served on hand-thrown crockery. But what’s on those plates is faithful to the real thing.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story That’s reflected in a clientele that includes plenty of locals and in a menu that lists what might be seen as “challenging” fare, like pan-fried duck eggs with prama (long-fermented fish) alongside others meant to appease unseasoned foreign palates (fresh spring rolls, chicken with cashew nuts). The former turned out to be unthreatening triangles of firm omelet surrounded by crinkle-cut carrot and eggplant slices and fresh ginger coins, studded with tender bits of prama that give more flavor than pure stink.\nThe prahok kroeung is perhaps more approachable, a mélange of nubbly minced pork and exceptionally rich coconut cream with the addictive texture of a fine, long-cooked ragú Bolognese. Served with a plate of raw vegetables, it invites eating with a spoon instead. In Cambodia, vegetable scraps become kokor, a coconut milk stew seasoned with prahok, toasted rice powder and black pepper. Rohatt’s lush camouflage-green version includes green beans, water spinach and winter squash cooked until it melts into the coconut milk.\nI left Siem Reap wishing I could swing back to Rohatt for a breakfast of numban chok, fermented rice vermicelli doused with a choice of curries and served with whatever foraged leafy greens and herbs are in season.\nPhoto Produce at the Phsar Chas market, a source for chefs in Siem Reap. Credit David Hagerman for The New York Times King’s Road Angkor Shopping Center, Achar Sva Road-Siem Reap River; 855-11-676-734; rohattcafe.com . An average meal for two, without drinks or tip, is about $24.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Khmer Touch Cuisine Khmer Touch Cuisine sits opposite the Angkor Night Market; when the band takes the stage each night, floors shake and conversation is all but impossible. So go for lunch, when you can sit on the open-air ground floor, which smells appetizingly of wet herbs, lemongrass, shallots and kroeung.\nSomontha Oeng, who worked her way up from dining room steward to sous chef at the luxury Amansara resort before opening Khmer Touch Cuisine last October, has peppered her menu with what she describes as refined versions of Cambodian street foods, which I found to be the menu’s highlights.\nMs. Oeng turns ombok, flattened toasted rice flakes usually mixed with ice and sugar syrup as a treat for children, into an amuse-bouche by roasting it in a dry pan with garlic, slivered wild lime leaf and spring onion leaves. The rice cake with coconut sauce consists of golden orbs of crispy batter enclosing rich coconut cream that walk an intriguing line between sweet and savory.\nHer lotus salad is stunning: stem, root, seeds and blush pink petals (the traditional version uses only the stem) with chicken and basil in a lightly sweet dressing balanced by the kicky pepper-astringency of the flower. The classic street grill of skewered beef marinated in kroeung could do with a lick more fire and a lot more of the green papaya pickle, which is wonderfully fiery, sweet-sour and crunchy.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story The limited dessert selection includes a star: melting slices of banana gloved in light, velvety, perfectly grease-free batter and served with two scoops of smoky, butterscotch-reminiscent palm sugar ice cream.\nOld Market Area, Sivutha Boulevard (Opposite Triangle Bar); 855-63-76-56-89; khmertouchcuisine.com . An average meal for two, without drinks or tip, is about $45.\nMie Cafe Set in a traditional wooden house in a residential neighborhood 10 minutes from the center of town, Mie Cafe glows sofly at night, a beacon to food lovers seeking an escape from touristy Pub Street. A short path from the road cuts through the kitchen garden where the chef, Pola Siv, cultivates chiles, a few other vegetables and the herbs and blossoms he uses to garnish dishes and prepare infusions inspired by Cambodian herbal medicine. Tables in the open-air ground-floor dining area have a view of the glassed-in kitchen; upstairs, there’s air-conditioning, lower lights and a bit more privacy.\nWith a long à la carte section and two special menus that change daily, Mie covers a lot of ground — much like the chef himself. After washing dishes for several years, Mr. Siv moved first to Bahrain and then to the Cayman Islands, working as a waiter.\n“I love to cook because of my mother,” he said, but meeting Anthony Bourdain and Eric Ripert in the Caymans “inspired me to be a chef.”\nAfter graduating from a Swiss cooking academy, Mr. Siv worked at the Michelin-starred Domaine de Châteauvieux in Satigny before returning to Siem Reap in late 2012. He opened Mie Cafe as a noodle joint a few months later, then transitioned the restaurant to fine dining after he had saved enough money for renovations and kitchen equipment.\nSome dishes, like the gorgeous beef laab, are joyfully extravagant inversions of Cambodian classics. Mr. Siv reinvents the raw meat salad as a disc of beef tartare crowned with a luxuriant lawn of sea-salty wakame, delicate young herbs and violet pea flowers. Other plates, like the pan-fried chhlang fish crusted with sour fermented krill and garnished with astringent slivers of green tamarind, are straightforward expressions of the chef’s ability to combine local ingredients (he works with organic growers and local foragers) with European technique and plating.\nStill others feel like an attempt to appeal to less adventurous diners — the glazed barbecue pork ribs (sticky and delicious, if a bit tough) with French fries, for example, or the avocado rolls with Mekong langoustine: California rolls without the rice and nori.\nThe daily Surprise Menu showcases Mr. Siv’s enthusiasm for experimentation, sometimes at the expense of consistency. One night the winning beef laab starter was followed by a mysterious dish of three unwedded components — a short rib, a fried frangipani blossom and a pillow of plain sticky rice — and a crispy rice cake turned gummy beneath a crown of wonderfully rich coconut ice cream.\nBut each of my meals at Mie excited and intrigued enough to lure me back. One senses that Mr. Siv is the chef to watch in a city that may be on its way to becoming one of the region’s most interesting places to eat.\n85 Phum Treng Khum Slorgram; 855-12-791-371; miecafe-siemreap.com .
