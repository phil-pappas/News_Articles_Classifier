The décor is much too eclectic, the elevators climb at a woefully slow pace, and the gym has a did-it-myself ethos. The property opened last August to much buzz. It is in the same general area as the Fontainebleau and the Miami Beach Edition, but it seeks to be more affordable. Art Deco design details, like the sputnik ceiling lights and quirky tiles (some with images of dragonflies and fish, others with trompe l’oeil designs), are fun to check out, even if they’re not exactly coherent as a whole. Two selling points are the outdoor spaces: the pool on the ground floor and the spacious roof deck, which offers views of the ocean and the surrounding city.\nLocation A block from the ocean and a less-than-10-minute ride from the shopping and dining hubs around Lincoln Road, Hotel Croydon is both close to the action and removed enough to give guests breathing room. The Fontainebleau and its upscale club Liv are just a short walk away, as are Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s two top-notch restaurants at the Miami Beach Edition and the buzzy 27 at the Freehand Miami, serving New American cuisine.\nThe Room A standout feature in my double-queen room was the cooling gel memory foam on the beds, which made for a night of blissful sleep. Theoretically, the earthy tones of the room and leather furnishings should have created a cozy atmosphere, but in reality, the muted shades made the decent-size room feel smaller. This mildly claustrophobic sensation was reinforced by the small window that didn’t offer a lot of natural light or even a nice view. The usual suspects filled the minibar: snack foods, like a fig bar and veggie straws, as well as wine and liquor.\nThe Bathroom Mine was compact and neat, with a standing-only, glassed-in shower and relaxing beige and cream tones. Stocked with C.O. Bigelow bath products, it hit the right note between functional and elegant.\nDining Room service isn’t available, but guests are free to bring food from the Tavern, a Mediterranean restaurant in the hotel, to their rooms. Menu items are fairly standard, including a variety of sandwiches and burgers.\nAmenities Hotel extras are what set the Croydon apart. There’s free shuttle service to and from Miami International Airport. Guests interested in lounging directly on the beach across Collins Avenue are offered free towels and two beach chairs. The gym has the basics, including a treadmill, stationary bicycles, weights, yoga mats, a rowing machine and a punching bag. The pool is the perfect spot to cool off after a workout, to which the building’s Art Deco architecture, palm trees and black-and-white umbrellas add a dash of old-school Miami glam. There I overheard a guest describe the lounge beds as “divine,” and they were. Take advantage of them during the hotel’s happy hour, when libations are free for guests. The Croydon also has a spa, where guests can indulge in an Ayurvedic facial ($130), a Thai yoga stretch and massage ($130 for 60 minutes) or even a universal kabbalah consultation ($100). Those in the mood for more active relaxation can try one of the yoga classes offered several times a week for $20.\nPhoto The restaurant at Hotel Croydon.
