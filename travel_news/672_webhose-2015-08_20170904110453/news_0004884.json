Incorporated in 1956, and located five minutes from O’Hare Airport and twenty minutes from Chicago’s downtown, the entertainment suburb hosts an average 75,000 visitors a day. Residents and visitors alike enjoy all the amenities for which Rosemont is known, including the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center, a wide variety of hotel and dining options, the Allstate Arena, Rosemont Theatre, the lively entertainment district MB Financial Park and the new Fashion Outlets of Chicago, plus a popular indoor sporting venue known as The Dome. \nThe Dome was destroyed today in a thunderstorm and luckily was empty at the time the storm hit. The dome is a poly-vinyl bubble attached to the ground; it is held up by air. When the air is let out, the structure collapses. \nThe arena is \"quite large\" and holds two professional sized softball fields, there is \"very little'' room for spectators.It's hundreds of feet long by probably a couple of hundred feet wide. Volleyball, Little League baseball, field hockey and other sporting events are also held at the venue, which is about two years old. \nA burst of thunderstorm activity across the Chicago area on Sunday afternoon resulted in multiple injuries and a death at an event in west suburban Wood Dale, besides the collapse of the Dome in Rosemont. It also caused the temporary evacuation of the music festival Lollapalooza in Grant Park downtown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:30:38.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
