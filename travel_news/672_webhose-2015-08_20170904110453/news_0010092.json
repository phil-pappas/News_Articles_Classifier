Twenty of the rooms are equipped with a private open-air bath overlooking the surrounding woodland. \n\n\"Our other Kai properties reflect the regional culture and cuisine in different parts of Japan. This time we wanted to focus on the culture of Tochigi Prefecture,\" Fumi Miyauchi, a spokeswoman for Hoshino, told TTG Asia e-Daily . \"Part of our aim was to enable visitors to feel and enjoy the charm of local handicrafts and the culture of the region during their stay.‚Äù \n\nHoshino anticipates that the property will appeal across age groups and expects to attract visitors from overseas as well. The hotel also offers a room for pets. \n\nWith the addition of the Kinugawa outpost, Hoshino Resorts will boost 13 Kai properties in operation, each consisting of fewer than 50 guest rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T08:45:05.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
