Adv: \nAug 06, 2015 Adv: \nTORONTO, Canada - It might be August, but summer is in full swing with heat wave alerts and temperatures topping 40 degrees across the country. It's no surprise that Canadian travelers are seeking relief from the heat and flocking to water-based attractions. Whether you are looking to spend the day lounging on a beach, on a surfboard or a gravity defying water slide, Canada is overflowing with water attractions to help travelers keep cool this summer. \nThe travel experts are sharing their favorite attractions and where to stay if you're planning a water-based trip: \n1. Calypso (Limoges, Ontario) \nWhy we love it: The country's biggest themed waterpark features more than 35 waterslides and 100 water games, including two lazy river rides, a kiddie park and a mad scientist themed area. The park's 52,000-square-foot wave pool is the largest in Canada and Summit Tower is the tallest waterslide tower in North America. \nWhere to stay: Quality Inn (3363 St. Joseph Blvd., Orleans, ON) \n2. Lawrencetown and Stoney Beach (Lawrencetown Provincial Park, NS) \nWhy we love it: Lawrencetown Provincial Park is great for sporty and adventurous travellers and is known for some of the best surfing in North America. Lawrencetown Beach is the popular choice for surfing enthusiasts and swimmers, but Stoney Beach is a great option for kite surfing thanks to its shallow waters and strong winds. \nWhere to stay: Comfort Inn (456 Windmill Rd., Dartmouth, NS) \n3. Magic Mountain (Moncton, New Brunswick) \nWhy we love it: Magic Mountain, located near the infamous Magnetic Hill, is the largest man made tourist attraction in Atlantic Canada.

Beachclub (Pointe-Calumet, QC) \nWhy we love it: Just 30 minutes outside of Montreal is the largest outdoor club in North America, where guests can party on the beach with some of the world's hottest DJs like Tiesto and Hardwell. It's also great for celeb spotting. Rumour has it Justin Bieber will be visiting soon and Kylie Jenner is slated to celebrate her 18th birthday here. \nWhere to stay: Quality Suites Montreal Aéroport (6300 Transcanadienne, Pointe-Claire, QC) \n6. Cultus Lake Waterpark (Cultus Lake, BC) \nWhy we love it: This award-winning waterpark gets the top spot in British Columbia for a reason.
