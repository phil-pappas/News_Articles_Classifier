Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB) has debuted a campaign called “Thailand MICE Planet” to promote the Thai MICE industry and amplify the position on the global scale.\nNothing projects confidence among industry leaders better than a true collaboration between the government and private sector. Consequently, the alliance between TCEB and Thai MICE operators largely impacts the country’s economy as a whole, as it will help attract more international conferences, exhibitions, incentives, and conventions. The core objective of the campaign is to boost Thailand’s tourism industry, calling upon Top’s Thai MICE practitioners to partake in the Digital MICE Award 2015 on condition that the participants must be able to illustrate his/her expertise in harnessing marketing strategies electronically, Ms. Jintana Phongpakdee, Corporate Communications Director of IMPACT Exhibition Management Co., Ltd, said.\nIMPACT Exhibition Management Co., Ltd has initiated a simulation game application named “The Land beyond Dreams” to encourage individuals as well as exhibitors and consumers alike to get to know more about this industry in the area of hotels, tourism and hospitality, as well as exhibition and meeting venues, while providing downloaders a fundamental knowledge and familiarizing them with what this industry does and offers.\nThis simulation game application is vital for venue operators across the country to introducing themselves via a Facility’s guide and presenting their uniqueness, hence giving a competitive edge in the local and global market. Players can win many fabulous prizes by competing daily challenges.\nSource:-IMPACT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:15:27.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
