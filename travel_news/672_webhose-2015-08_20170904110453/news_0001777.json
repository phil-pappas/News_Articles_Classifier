Although it won’t be available on shorthaul Singapore-Manila services, it will be available on flights to other SIA destinations via Singapore. \n\nLike SIA, sister airline SilkAir is also enjoying brisk business connecting Singapore to secondary gateways in the Philippines, with Boracay and Cebu being added to its routes last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T11:38:01.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
