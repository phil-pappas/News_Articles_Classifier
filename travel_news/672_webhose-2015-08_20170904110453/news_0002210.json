By incorporating destination partners into the pavilion, Etihad Airways and Alitalia are able to bring the world to the Expo, one week at a time. These events will give a better understanding of what the travel industry can offer, and “Chengdu Week” is just one of the premium destination showcases to be featured at the joint pavilion.\nChengdu is the capital city of Sichuan Province in southwest China, and is famous around the world as the home of China’s Giant Pandas. Sponsored by the Chengdu Culture and Tourism Development Group, “Chengdu Week” will include a themed exhibit and activities to showcase the city as a premium tourist destination and a regional cultural centre in Southwest China. The Chengdu Culture and Tourism Development Group, established in 2007 by the Chengdu municipal government, is crucial to the development of the tourist industry in Chengdu, and the main partner responsible for programming this event.\nThe full schedule of events will include a master chef class to teach guests how to make Sichuan cuisine at home, a traditional tea ceremony, a Chengdu heritage talent show called Face Changing Opera, and a “Kungfu Panda” welcome show. The cooking show includes five popular Sichuan family cuisines, including Chinese scrambled eggs, braised eggplant, Kungpao Chicken, Mapo (spicy) Tofu, and Chengdu Spicy Dumplings, which will be presented for sampling at the Etihad Airways and Alitalia Pavilion every day during the week.\nShane O’Hare, Senior Vice President, Marketing of Etihad Airways, said: “As one of our four destinations on Greater China, Chengdu is an important market for us. We are excited to use the Expo Milano Joint Pavilion to allow more people to know the beautiful city. ”\n“Etihad Airways launched its Chengdu route with four flights per work on 15 December 2011, with daily services beginning on 30 March, 2014, offering the first and only direct airline connection between the UAE and China’s Sichuan province, home to a population of over 80 million.
