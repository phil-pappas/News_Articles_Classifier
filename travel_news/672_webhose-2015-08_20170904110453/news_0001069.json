You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Eric Montfort/Flickr \n…Tassili n'Ajjer National Park!!! What we love about this location, is that incredible surreal landscape. It looks like something that NASA would publish from Rover’s latest adventures. Except it’s not on Mars, it’s actually in the Algerian portion of the Sahara Desert. If you’re a fan of all the arches and waves Utah and Arizona have to offer, then you’ll really love this place.
