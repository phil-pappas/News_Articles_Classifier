At the time myself and other beachgoers just stared at the strange sight of a chap dressed in shorts and a t-shirt standing on what appeared to be a surf board, using a giant paddle. \nOriginating in Hawaii as an offshoot of surfing, it's one of the fastest growing watersports and not such a strange sight anymore around the coast and on river waterways. \nI was keen to give it go and where better than the Westcounty's mecca of surf, in Newquay? \nTicket to Ride Surf School has recently created two fun evenings for stand-up paddleboarding (SUP). On a Wednesday is the men-only Paddle and Pint evening, and on a Thursday is the ladies-only Paddle and Prosecco evening, so I placed myself in the hands of their expert instructors for my first go. \nAfter a safety talk on the beach from experienced surfer and paddleboarder Gordon Ingram, who is operations manager for Ticket to Ride's Newquay and Perranporth branches, we headed out over small waves to a calmer spot. \nGetting onto my knees I started paddling and it wasn't too long before I felt reasonably capable of propelling myself in roughly the right direction, i.e., away from the beach. \nUnfortunately I can't stay on my knees for too long so we progressed to the stand up part of paddleboarding. \nGordon patiently talked me through moving from a kneeling to standing position as my legs and the board seemed to take on a life of their own and want to go in different directions. \nI appreciated the board from many different angles as I tumbled into the sea on several attempts to remain upright. \nAnd then it happened. I stood up, with the nose of board pointing towards the horizon, took a couple of paddle strokes and for a few glorious moments I was on my way. The world was my oyster and this was merely the beginning of my great exploration. Then my legs wobbled and I fell into the sea. \nPleasantly tired, I bobbed about and got my breath back while taking in the amazing location. \nThe school uses Great Western Beach which makes a fantastic backdrop for an evening paddle. There's nothing like a bit of fun and a healthy activity to balance out a hectic week. \nSUP is good for you too. It's a cardio-vascular workout and great for core muscles. It also helps your balance and co-ordination, though mine would need a few more goes to improve! \nAfter the session I joined the other ladies for Prosecco (mine was sparkling apple) on the terrace of the Trebarwith Hotel. It overlooks the beach, with private steps leading down onto the sand. \nThe evening was over too soon, but left me with the sight of a glorious sunset and a yearning to return to the water again soon. \nGordon said: \"This summer at Ticket to Ride Surf Schools we have seen a dramatic increase in popularity. More people are trying it out and taking lessons with us. \n\"It's great to see the sport taking off so much here in Newquay.\" \nIt's fun, healthy and potentially addictive, so why not give it a try? \n- The evening sessions cost Â£15 per person or you can book a SUP lesson.
