Bubble wrap is an effective insulator thanks to the air trapped inside the bubbles. Within confined spaces, air is slow to react to temperature changes, so in winter bubble wrap can protect against the cold penetrating through your windows. Bubble wrap is returning to its insulating roots, helping homeowners cut their energy bills Bubble wrap was invented in 1957 by engineers Alfred Fielding and Marc Chavannes to use as a fancy wallpaper texture. The idea never caught on, so the pair sold it as greenhouse insulation. Sadly, this application did not become commercially successful either. It was only when marketer Frederick Bowers pitched bubble wrap as shipping protection to computer firm IBM that it became a hit. But now the product is returning to its insulating roots, helping homeowners cut their household energy bills by keeping the cold out. How to use bubble wrap for insulation The good news is that it requires no technical skills, just a spray bottle of water, a knife and bubble wrap. First, mist the water onto a window. Then spread the smooth side of the bubble wrap over the wet surface and cut away any excess. The water should hold the bubble wrap to your window all winter (and it will not stain the window). Bubble wrap can be bought online for £2 for a 10m roll. Once cut to size for your glass, you can reuse it for years. And while you won’t want to block out your front window, adding bubble wrap to the small side one you never use could make a difference to your bills. And you can bet the neighbours will soon be copying the idea to slash their own energy costs. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:33:11.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
