Expert Videos \nWhile the Golden Mile beachfront and new harbour development is the focus of central Durban, for many holidaymakers the focus of fun has shifted northwards, mainly to Umhlanga Rocks (or just plain Umhlanga*), but also to places such as Ballito, some 20 minutes north of town on what is called the North Coast. Until about a decade ago Umhlanga was a satellite holiday village of Durban, but today it has been gobbled up by the city and is in fact now the most upmarket residential, business and holiday area. The Oyster Box This will always, I hope, be my first choice of lodgings in Durban. Actually it's in Umhlanga Rocks, once a separate holiday village but now guzzled up in the city's north-bound sprawl. When it was first opened this British colonial dowager, with a touch of Nouveau, stood lonely sentinel next the the Umhlanga lighthouse. Generous lawns rolled down to the rocky shore, and still do, except now Umhlanga (a Zulu name inferring a stream with reeds) is a bustling seaside suburb at the heart of modern-day upmarket Durban. The hotel has undergone extensive renovations. Imagine a dash of old colonial, a shake of Art Nouveau, a heaping spoon of Caribbean sugar estate, mixed with a sprinkle of South East Asian minimalism, and you get \"The Oyster Box\". You cannot imagine until you see it, but the recipe works just splendidly.\nPrices: Range from R2,000 a person sharing a standard room (no view) to R6,500 for a sea-facing de luxe room. There are also garden villas (R6,500 a person) and a presidential suite (around R50,000 for the suite) Contact: Tel +27 (0)31-514-5000 \nBeverly Hills When the Oysterbox was already a grand old dame of the beach-front, upstart Johannesburg inn keeper Sol Kerzner opened his - and Durban's - first five-star holiday hotel down the lane in Lighthouse Road. Sol went on to become the world's most celebrated hotelier (Sun International, Atlantis, Sun City, One&Only) and the Beverly Hills (just love the name) continues his tradition of world class service with all the amenities you'd expect (including wireless room access and its own e-library). \nPrices: around R1,700 a person sharing (out of high season) Contact: Tel +27 (0)31 -561-2211 \nTeremok Marine The story of Constantine Vladykin and Termok is as romantic and intriguing as the place itself, what with escaping from the Russian revolution, a mining education in England, life on the mines in SA, and love, life and death - all encapsulated in this 5-star boutique lodge on Marine Drive in Umhlanga Rocks (neighbours include the Oppenheimers of Anglo-American and De Beers fame). There's a maybe even more impressive sister riverside lodge in northern Johannesburg, if you happen to be stopping in there. \nPrices: R2,750 for a double suite, B&B Contact: Tel +27 (0)31-561-5848 \nThe Boathouse If you're looking for somewhere special a little bit of out town, and I suggest this is a fine option for claustrophobics, the beach house at Ballito Beach, about 20 minutes north of Durban has generous, open spaces and lightness, feeling of being on a luxury liner, with white backdrops and dark wood decking in public areas, views of the sea interrupted only by a sliver of powdery sand, and with no chance of getting seasick. And then there's the beach itself, which many people would say is the nicest swimming beach in KwaZulu-Natal. \nPrices: Starting around R850 a person sharing a standard room, to R6,500 for penthouse Contact: Tel +27 (0)32-946-0300", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T08:08:21.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
