It is paramount that we work with organisations such as the BHA and represent and reflect the interests of the UK independent hotel sector.” Registration for the Independent Hotel Show 2015 is now live and the show promises to be bigger and better than ever before, with a packed seminar programme and new features such as the ‘Independent Think Tank’ designed for targeted workshops and events.
