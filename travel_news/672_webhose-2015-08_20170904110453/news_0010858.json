Globus currently operates 46 hypermarkets and 90 DIY stores throughout Germany and is one of the few large independent family-run businesses in the German retail industry. \nReason enough to celebrate the company’s successful development in style. Some 9,000 employees came to Messe Stuttgart, which for one day was transformed into a wonderful world of Globus-themed events. In a total of three halls, the guests enjoyed a variety of stage shows and concerts, took part in activities and sampled tasting stands hosted by many of the company’s partners, and fortified themselves at various buffets offering specialities from the countries in which Globus is represented. Even the Rothaus Park and East Entrance were part of the event concept, featuring a number of event highlights. The Atrium was transformed into a relaxation zone, where guests could discover the barefoot trail or enjoy a refreshing drink at the juice bar in the specially created indoor garden area. The Messe Stuttgart team were also well prepared to handle the complex travel logistics: a total of 180 coaches brought the Globus staff to Stuttgart from all over Germany. The grounds outside the venue served as a coach park. Company events and anniversary celebrations like those organised by Globus SB-Warenhaus GmbH & Co. KG are now commonplace at Messe Stuttgart. “The way in which the different areas are used shows the versatility of our grounds when it comes to hosting guest events. Whether it’s the halls, the Rothaus Park or foyer – we can cater to the specific needs and requirements of our individual guests, and at the same time, offer them a professional comprehensive package from lighting through to catering”, explains Stefan Lohnert, Division Director Guest Events at Messe Stuttgart. Olaf Schomaker, Managing Director at Globus, was also clearly satisfied: “We wanted to celebrate our company anniversary with a wide range of exhilarating events. Messe Stuttgart provided the ideal conditions for our ambitious event concept and impressed us immensely with its service and the versatility of its grounds.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T22:19:15.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
