General Dawpong Ratanasuwan. “Economic growth and nature conservation must go hand in hand if we are to secure the future and build the resilience not just of Thailand, but of Asia as a whole,” he added. \nAsia is one of the world’s most dynamic regions, accounting for 40% of global economic output and 2/3 of global growth. At the same time 60% of the world’s population call Asia home, but 800 million live below the poverty line. Meanwhile, urban populations are predicted to grow from 1.9 billion to 3.3 billion in 2050.(1) \nThe fast pace of development is taking a toll on the region’s species and ecosystems. Asia is known for its rich natural diversity, hosting five of the world’s 17 mega-diverse countries. But this biodiversity is in crisis. Loss of mangrove cover and the rate of loss of wetlands are the highest in the world, and 95% of Southeast Asia’s coral reefs are at risk. Ten countries in Asia are experiencing high or very high water stress and more than 1,400 plants and animals are listed as Critically Endangered.(2) \nAt the centre of the crisis are the hundreds of millions of people who rely, directly or indirectly, on nature for food and livelihood, and those who live in vulnerable areas that are predicted to be hardest hit by climate change and disasters. \n“The challenges Asia faces today present an opportunity to build bridges between global and local action towards sustainable development,” said IUCN President Zhang Xinsheng. “Human, social and economic well-being – the keys to resilience of societies – depend on the health of natural ecosystems. We need to act now to protect nature, we need to innovate to rediscover the solutions already provided by nature, and we need to work together across all sectors to make these solutions happen,” he added. \nThe forum, ongoing at the Royal Orchid Sheraton until 12 August, provides a platform for leaders from all sectors of society to discuss nature-based solutions to environmental, economic, and social challenges in Asia. Under the theme of “Resilience in action: creating solutions for people and nature,” the forum will address themes such valuing and conserving nature, effective and equitable governance of nature’s use and deploying nature-based solutions to address societal challenges. A variety of side events on a broad range of topics will also be held from 10-11 August.
