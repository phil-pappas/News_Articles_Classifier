A two-hour session led by Nicola Crossland, a board member of ABPCO previously MD of an international events agency and social media marketing agent for companies worldwide, is designed to offer practical guidance on improving your social media plan.\n“Social media is a great marketing tool for events and event organisers. This workshop will offer practical hints and tips to those who have taken the plunge, but need a smarter approach,” said Nicola Crossland. “We will be using plain English to explain how to maximise accounts, build a community and design a social media strategy that will help save time, raise your profile, build brand, generate enquiries and take the stress out of managing your online presence.”\nShocklogic, leaders in online event management software and solutions, will also offer practical guidance on the significance of content and how a solid content strategy is the foundation of an enquiry generating social media campaign.\nThe Exhibition Centre Liverpool, opening at the start of September, is a 8,100 sqm venue capable of hosting exhibitions, conferences, banquets, concerts and sporting events on a national and international scale.\nSource:-ABPCO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:05:39.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
