The president of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grimsson, was on hand for the festival last year. \n\"Outside of Iceland we have the highest population of people of Icelandic descent anywhere else in the world,\" said Kathi Thorarinson Neal, a member of the Islengadagurinn organizing committee. \n\"The mission of the festival is sharing Icelandic culture and heritage with Manitobans, Canadians and people from all over the world,\" she said. \n\"It's really important for me as a third or fourth generation of western Icelanders, that connection to the homeland isn't lost,\" commented Robbie Russo, who brought several Icelandic musicians to play at the festival. \n\"Art is a really great bridge to get our generations communicating and getting interested in each other,\" he said. \nThe cultural education component of the festival is important. Re-enactors present the daily life of the Vikings of centuries past, including demonstrating their warfare tactics on a field adjacent to the encampment. \nThis year the blacksmiths, tailors, weavers and other re-enactors share their knowledge of the Viking cultures across Scandinavia, the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland and Canada's Newfoundland island province between the years 850 and 950. \nSporting a luxurious-looking tunic, Christian Arel is playing the role of jarl — a Viking royal. \nIt is the tenth year the Quebecer, who moved several years ago to Alberta (two provinces over from Manitoba), has participated in the festival. \n\"Viking history is vibrant, dynamic, with a lot going on,\" he said, explaining why he keeps coming back. Also, he added, he gets to make crafts. \n\"We often see Vikings stereotypes in popular culture,\" noted Eric Limpalaër. The French historian who recently moved to Winnipeg also takes part in the annual festival, appreciating an opportunity to \"reestablish certain historical truths.\" — AFP-Relaxnews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:48:47.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
