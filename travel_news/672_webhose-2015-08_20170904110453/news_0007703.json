Risky assets also fell while bonds gained in Thailand after the bomb blast in Bangkok, Barclays said.\nThe Shanghai Composite ended the session 6.15% lower and the Hang Seng lost 1.43%. The Dow Jones was flat at the JSE’s close (0.02%) and the FTSE 100 was 0.33% lower. The Paris CAC 40 was 0.15% lower and the German Dax had also lost 0.15%.\nAt 5pm the all share was up by 0.45% to 50,977 points and the blue-chip top 40 gained 0.4%. The gold index firmed 3.16%. Industrials rose 0.58%. Financials were also up by 0.58% and banks gained 0.49%. Property rose 0.42%. Resources dropped 0.48% and platinums shed 0.46%.\nGlacier International MD Andrew Brotchie said the local market, however, remained under some pressure.\n\"It is difficult to see some good news.\"\nOn the whole, however, the market was not looking as bad as the rand, with the weaker currency supporting rand hedge stocks. The top 10 JSE stocks on market value earned 70% of their earnings offshore, he said.\nBut emerging markets could expect continued headwinds.\n\"Further capital outflows could materialise if the US hikes rates,\" Mr Brotchie said.\nChina’s growth was also slowing down, and this would continue to exert pressure on the global market scene, he said.\nAmong individual shares on the JSE, Anglo American was 1.26% lower at R150.20, while ArcelorMittal slumped 7.64% to R12.93.\nAmong the rand hedges SABMiller added 0.76% to R667.95 and British American Tobacco firmed 0.4% to R742.43.\nAmong gold stocks Harmony lost 1.87% to R12.60, but Sibanye closed 2.26% higher at R14.04.\nPlatinum producer Lonmin continued its losing streak, closing 4.49% down at R6.80.\nFirstRand added 1.04% to R53.31 but Barclays Africa lost 1.03% to R178.48.\nRetail giant Shoprite was 1.39% higher at R160.25 after reporting strong annual results on the day. Massmart Holdings rose 2.29% to R127.86 and Woolies added 1.85% to R102.\nAfter losing nearly 10% in early trade, construction group Aveng recouped some of its losses in later trade, closing 2.73% lower at R4.98. It reported an annual loss on the day.\nAmong property stocks Resilient rose 1.62% to R113 and Growthpoint added 0.69% to R27.54.\nTelkom rebounded 3.7% to R62.16.\nIndustrial conglomerate Remgro ended the day 2.88% firmer at R259.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:13:17.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
