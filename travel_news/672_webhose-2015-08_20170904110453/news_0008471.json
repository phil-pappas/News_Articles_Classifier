If you stand by that pedestal and look up, you can take yourself back almost 70 years to a humid, mid-summer day. In the clear, morning sky you can see a single airplane. It’s big — four propeller-driven engines — and painted silver. You can see something separate from the plane and begin falling. Several seconds later there’s a blindingly bright flash. Being in that spot in Hiroshima, Japan, now is surreal. Knowing that for miles around from the hypocenter of the Little Boy atomic bomb tens of thousands of people died instantly and tens of thousands more would die in the days, weeks, months and even years later from the burns and effects of radiation — it’s a sobering reminder of man’s inhumanity to man. And, yet, for me and for many more, there is a very real possibility that we are alive because of the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later. The bombings led Emperor Hirohito to agree to surrender and end World War II. In my case, my paternal grandfather was in the Army at Fort Ord, California. He likely would have been a part of the invasion of Japan and, given the casualty rates experienced in fighting the Japanese, it’s reasonable to think he might not have survived. My Aunt Mary recalls traveling by train with my grandmother late in 1945 from Baltimore to Fort Ord to visit my grandfather. My father was born 13 months after Hiroshima was bombed. Hiroshima today is a busy, metropolitan, port city. If you’ve been to San Diego or Boston, you’ve been to a city like Hiroshima. The Mazda Corp. has its headquarters there. The Carp are the city’s Japanese major league baseball team. There is an efficient and inexpensive trolley system that makes getting from the train station to the central business district to the port area fairly easy. There’s an airport, too, but why fly when you can take a bullet train — or shinkansen — through the beautiful, seaside Japanese landscape of mountains and farms at speeds up to 186 mph? A year ago I visited my Aunt Patti and Uncle Tom who live at a U.S. air base in a suburb of Tokyo. As a World War II history buff, I wanted to at least visit Hiroshima while I was there. I looked into also going to Nagasaki, but decided against it because adding the two days to go there would mean doing less in Tokyo. Visiting Hiroshima from Tokyo by train is at least a three-day excursion. It takes about six hours to get to Hiroshima, so if you leave Tokyo mid-morning, by the time you get there and settled in your hotel you have time to look around a little, but not really see much. So then you have the second day to leisurely explore the memorials and the Peace Museum. The third day is for the return trip. Page 2 of 3 - There are many hotel options — some right near the train station, some closer to Peace Memorial Park and a few along Hiroshima Bay. Patti and I stayed at the Hotel Hokke Club, which has an average rating on TripAdvisor.com of four out of five stars. The rooms were small, which is typical in Japan, but who needs a big room when you’re only using it for sleeping? They were only about $80 a night, including taxes. It was only about a four-block walk from the peace park, which is the focal point for most visitors to Hiroshima. The park is in an island in the Ota River, which splits into several branches as it reaches the bay. At the south end of the park is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. At the north end and across the river is the A-Bomb Dome, the former Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall that is recognizable to most as the enduring image of the effects of the atomic bomb. In between are several memorials and monuments that are both historical and religious in nature. The most revered memorial is the concrete cenotaph in the center of the park. Designed to resemble an arch-shaped house, it contains a registry of all the people who have died from the A-bomb. As of last Aug. 6, 292,325 names were in the registry along with many unidentified persons, according to the park’s website. Throughout the day, visitors stop and pray for the souls of the dead. Inscribed on the cenotaph is the declaration, “Let all the souls here rest in peace; For we shall not repeat the evil.” Most touching to me was the Children’s Peace Monument. It was inspired by the 1955 death at age 12 of Sadako Sasaki, who contracted leukemia from the bomb’s radiation when she was 2 years old. Her story is recalled in the children’s book “Sadako and the Thousand Cranes.” Her roommate in the hospital told her of a Japanese legend that anyone who folds 1,000 origami cranes will be granted a wish. She started folding cranes, but did not reach her goal before dying, the book says. However, Sadako’s family says she exceeded her goal of 1,000 cranes. Whether she did or not, her story spread first in Japan and then throughout the world, and schoolchildren started to make origami cranes and send them to Hiroshima to reach Sadako’s goal. Thousands of them are now displayed in cases near the Children’s Peace Monument. Her classmates and students from throughout Japan and in other countries raised money to design and build the monument. Within the monument is a bell that visitors can ring after offering a prayer. Below the bell is a polished stone bearing the inscription, “This is our cry. This is our prayer. For building peace in this world.” Page 3 of 3 - Another moving site within the park is the National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. It sits mostly below ground level on the park’s east side. Above ground is a sculpture designed to look like a clock stopped at 8:15 a.m. —the time when the bomb exploded. Below ground is an exhibit similar to the Cyclorama at the Gettysburg National Military Park. The Hall of Remembrance, a large, circular, dimly lit room, shows a 360-degree view of Hiroshima from the blast hypocenter at Shima Hospital. Tiles rise from the floor marking the distance from the hypocenter to show the extent of the bomb damage. Outside the Hall of Remembrance are interactive kiosks at which visitors can look up victims by name and read brief biographies. On the ground floor is a small theater that shows historical videos about bomb survivors and reading stations where visitors can learn more about individual survivors. The Peace Memorial Museum is a large complex of two buildings that houses collections on the history of Hiroshima leading up to, during and after World War II. The East Building that houses exhibits on Hiroshima before and during the war currently is closed for renovations. While there were American and European visitors to the museum on the day I visited — there was a group of Michigan State University students there — the vast majority of the visitors were Japanese. In some areas, the crowd was shoulder-to-shoulder, moving slowly past the exhibits — which have signs in English, Japanese and other languages — that explain how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were selected as targets — they and a few other cities had suffered relatively little damage during the war, meaning the effects of the bombs would be easier to quantify — and what happened after the bombing. Toward the end of the exhibit are descriptions of modern nuclear weapon systems. These exhibits percolate with an under-lying frustration that these weapons of mass destruction continue to exist. A display shows the dozens of letters mayors of Hiroshima have sent to the heads of state of countries that have tested nuclear weapons since 1968, calling on them to stop testing the weapons and dismantle their arsenals. There is a letter for every test. The city has clearly devoted itself to the cause of promoting peace in the world. It is certainly a worthy cause and one Ifeel compelled to adopt so that, to borrow a phrase from Abraham Lincoln, the deaths from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs will not have been in vain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T11:37:39.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
