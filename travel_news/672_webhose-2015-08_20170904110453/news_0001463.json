On the restaurant's website it is described as 'Australia's most popular take away food shop known for its quality services'.\nHowever, an inspection found conditions were far from 'quality.'\nThe shelves were found to be rusty, and as this photograph shows, food was left uncovered\nThe stove was caked in grease when the Sunshine Coast Council officer visited the restaurant\nThe Sunshine Coast Council inspected the property and told Caloundra Magistrates Court how they found cockroaches in the kitchen, stoves caked in grease, dirty worktops, walls and fixtures.\nThe Brisbane Times reported that inspectors also said food was 'poorly stored and likely to be easily contaminated', while they also found old rusty shelving inside the cool rooms and freezers.\nThe restaurant serves seafood, carvery, salads and Asian cuisine in an area popular with locals and tourists.\n Timing is everything: Save up to 45% on your summer...

The owner of the restaurant, Jerry Li, told the court that he was angry that the information and photos had been released now when the inspection had taken place in February.\nHe also stated that he had closed the restaurant for 10 days to make the necessary improvements required by the Sunshine Coast Council.\nWhen asked to re-affirm that the improvements had been made, Mr Li added: 'Of course we have, Council would not have let us open if we didn't.'\nWork surfaces were dirty, and the officers also found cockroaches when inspecting the property\nIn an interview with Sunshine Coast Daily , Mr Li added: 'I just run a small business and now they tell everybody I am no good.\n'I have been in business 19 years and every year I do okay (with Sunshine Coast Council inspections), then this happen and it is not so good.\n'The photos, they make it look worse (than it was).'\nMagistrate Stephanie Tonkin issued a global penalty for nine charges of £8,000 (AUS$17,000) in addition to £670 (AUS$1,423) for professional and court costs.\nThe Council said that after inspecting Centrepoint Buffet, they had no alternative but to 'enforce the law'\nSunshine Coast Council community programs councillor Jenny McKay told the court that 95 per cent of the area's restaurants were up to standard where hygiene was concerned.\n'Our focus is on education and awareness, and if a food safety contravention is identified Council will consult with the food business to understand and address the issue', she said.\n'And most of the food operators on the Sunshine Coast are doing the right thing, with only around five per cent issued with improvement notices.\nThe Council told the court that 95 per cent of businesses pass the hygiene requirements on the Sunshine Coast (file photo)\n'In this instance however, council determined the business had a number of critical food safety non-compliances and out of concern for customer safety took the case to prosecution.\n'The central message from today's case to all food businesses on the Sunshine Coast is provide your customers with safe, hygienic food or face the consequences.\n'Council takes food safety seriously and works with food businesses to ensure they meet the food safety standards. When a business fails to work with Council, we have no option left but to prosecute to enforce the law to protect the community.'\nMailOnline Travel has contacted the Centrepoint Buffet for comment.\nRead more: Caloundra restaurant cops $18,000 fine for cockroaches in the kitchen", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1McFCpt", "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/caloundra-restaurant-cops-18000-fine-for-cockroaches-in-the-kitchen-20150805-gis4og.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:48:40.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
