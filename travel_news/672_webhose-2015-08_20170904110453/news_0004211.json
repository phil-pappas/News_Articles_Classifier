The hotel is the creation of PTT Family, whose empire of award winning restaurants and bars in Indonesia and Singapore include the internationally acclaimed ‘Potato Head Beach Club’ in Bali – a must do on any visit to the island – as well as a 20 villa estate synonymous with cutting edge environmental design and a leading contemporary Indonesian art gallery. \nOpening in December 2015, The Katamama has been created by PTT Family using ‘home’ as a watchword, with all aspects of the design and experience based on this philosophy. Every facet of the hotel has been personally designed and created by Indonesia’s finest craftsmen, utilising the dying arts and artisan practices that are unique to Indonesia. At the helm is the visionary Ronald Akili, one of Indonesia's leading entrepreneurs who has now broadened his hospitality horizons to The Katamama, the first of three hotels to be built on prime Bali beachfront locations. The second landmark project, The Kataoma – collaborating with world-renowned architecture practice OMA, headed by Rem Koolhaas - will open in 2018 with The Katamama Canggu following shortly afterwards in 2019. The Katamama will offer guests the chance to experience understated luxury and Indonesian culture through PTT Family’s contemporary context with inviting architecture, sophisticated design and exciting international brand collaborations from the disciplines of design, fashion, music, art, mixology and the culinary arts. Contemporary design elements pay reference to the Balinese lifestyle and lush green gardens epitomise the natural beauty of the island. Renowned Indonesian architect and long-time PTT Family collaborator Andra Martin has designed The Katamama, with interiors a partnership between the owners and the Singapore based design company Takenouchi Webb. The hotel will be finished with Indonesian materials such as Balinese bricks, teak, hand-made tiles from Java and terrazzo made on site. With only 58 suites, The Katamama is intimate and serene, offering some of the largest living spaces of any hotel in Bali, in each of its categories. The suites will be filled with curated artwork, handpicked furniture and cherished collectibles, many of them originally part of the owner’s personal collection. All suites will feature plentiful outdoor space, whether balconies, secluded gardens or individual pools. Unique in Bali will be the One-bedroom Penthouses; at 268 sqm these two storey suites offer internal access to a rooftop garden complete with stunning ocean views, a spa bath and rain shower and dining and lounge areas, complete with its very own bar. The crowning glory of the hotel will be the Presidential Penthouse suite, housing two bedrooms and a completely private rooftop garden with picture perfect ocean views. The Katamama forms the core of a community of like-minded businesses, a neighbourhood that is fast becoming Bali’s creative hub. These local establishments include Potato Head Beach Club, Escalier - Indonesia’s leading independent luxury fashion boutique and Alchemy, the island’s first 100% raw vegan cafe & juice bar, with more to be announced. In addition to these neighbouring companies, two more are situated within the hotel itself. ‘MoVida x Potato Head’ restaurant will be a unique collaboration that will combine MoVida's Spanish cuisine and Potato Head’s design and architectural expression. With five sites across Australia and best-selling cookbooks to its name, this restaurant will be MoVida’s first international venture. Also housed within the hotel space will be ‘Akademi’ – a bar created by award winning mixologist Dre Masso. Akademi will be a hub for the world’s most celebrated mixologists and a centre for the craft, offering patrons a curated selection of cocktails using the finest Indonesian tropical ingredients, many of them previously overlooked. Free from formality but uncompromised when it comes to personal service and with exceptional design and creative programming The Katamama showcases Indonesia’s rich culture and traditions through PTT Family’s lauded contemporary outlook.
