The free SIM card summer promotion is one of the many benefits and cost-savings that pass holders can enjoy while traveling in Europe with Eurail,\" said Silvia Görlach, Sales and Marketing Manager of Eurail Group G.I.E. \n\"Following the popularity of the summer offer in 2014, we've increased the number of SIM cards available this year and added additional customer service tools,\" stated Ms Görlach. Eurail Global Pass customers can enjoy unlimited free incoming calls and 200 minutes of free Wi-Fi in selected premium hotspots across Europe, allowing them to easily share their journey with friends and family back home while they experience the trip of a lifetime. \nAdaptable for all SIM card types, each card comes pre-loaded with 18 EUR of credit, and pass holders can opt to choose from 100 minutes of free international calls, 100MB of data, or 300 text messages. Once the pre-loaded credit is used, travellers can conveniently top up their credit and still enjoy the same attractive Eurail roaming rates across Europe. \n\"Using the Eurail SIM card is up to ten times cheaper than standard roaming fees. Passengers can benefit from competitive rates across all 28 Eurail Pass countries in Europe, and not worry about returning home to an unpleasant, expensive phone bill with excessive roaming charges,\" added Ms Görlach. \nAvailable until 30 September 2015, or until stocks last, Eurail Global Pass holders simply need to register their details and pass number on the dedicated website to apply for the free SIM card. Cards take 6-11 days to deliver and come with a quick-start user guide, while travelling passengers can easily check their account history, balance and top up their credit through a special Eurail Members Area site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:39:49.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
