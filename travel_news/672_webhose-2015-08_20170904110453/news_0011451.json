Teddy Bear Tea, the favourite New England holiday event for families, begins December 1, 2015 at the Bristol Restaurant and Bar. Four Seasons furry resident Truffles the Bear makes a return appearance at this year’s series, delighting families and young guests.\nSince its inception more than two decades ago, Teddy Bear Tea has become a popular New England event series, featuring a festive afternoon tea at Bristol Restaurant and Bar accompanied by a reading of a holiday children’s book by a Boston celebrity. Running December 1 through December 23, 2015 Teddy Bear Tea is seated daily at 3:15 pm, and features a menu of delectable tea sandwiches and pastries prepared by Four Seasons chefs, and a delightful array of special holiday beverages and premium teas, served in the relaxed elegance of Bristol Restaurant and Bar overlooking the beautiful Boston Public Garden.\n“Teddy Bear Tea is a special event for all of us at Four Seasons Hotel Boston, as each year we welcome back generations of families and friends who have been part of this tradition for more than twenty years,” says Ryan Jimenez, Director of Public Relations at Four Seasons Hotel Boston. “More than a holiday event, Teddy Bear Tea is an important community benefit program of the Hotel, teaching young guests the spirit of charity. We invite guests to bring a teddy bear to donate at the event, with the Hotel in turn donating all collected bears to local Boston organisations that benefit children in need.”\nSince founding the event series, Four Seasons Hotel Boston has collected more than 100,000 bears for local children’s organisations, and collects approximately 5,000 bears each year for distribution. Over its storied history, Teddy Bear Tea has hosted notable celebrity readers including Red Sox player David Ortiz, model Gisele Bündchen, Miss Massachusetts and many figures from Boston news media.\n“As one of Boston’s favourite annual holiday happenings, there is an extreme demand for reservations for this event series,” says Jimenez. “In fact, in some years, the call volume for reservation requests has temporarily overwhelmed our phone system. We recommend calling as early as possible once reservations open so guests can secure their date of choice.”\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:19:44.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
