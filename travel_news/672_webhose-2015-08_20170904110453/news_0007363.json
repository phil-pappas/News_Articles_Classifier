June was the 19th consecutive month that full-time equivalent (FTE) employment for US scheduled passenger airlines exceeded the same month of the previous year and was the highest monthly total since September 2008. \nMonth-to-month, the number of FTEs rose 0.3 percent from May to June, the sixth consecutive monthly increase (Table 1A). Scheduled passenger airline categories include network, low-cost, regional and other airlines. \nThe five network airlines that collectively employ two-thirds of the scheduled passenger airline FTEs reported 3.1 percent more FTEs in June 2015 than in June 2014. Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways increased FTEs from June 2014 while United Airlines reduced FTEs. Month-to-month, the number of network airline FTEs rose 0.4 percent from May to June, rising for the ninth consecutive month. Network airlines operate a significant portion of their flights using at least one hub where connections are made for flights to down-line destinations or spoke cities. \nThe six low-cost carriers reported 4.9 percent more FTEs in June 2015 than in June 2014. Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and Virgin America reported increases while Frontier Airlines reduced FTEs. Month-to-month, the number of low-cost airline FTEs rose 0.6 percent from May to June, rising for the third consecutive month. Low-cost airlines operate under a low-cost business model, with infrastructure and aircraft operating costs below the overall industry average. \nThe 12 regional carriers reported 0.1 percent more FTEs in June 2015 than in June 2014. Eight regional airlines – PSA Airlines, Mesa Airlines, Compass Airlines, Horizon Air, Republic Airlines, GoJet Airlines, SkyWest and Envoy – reported increased employment levels. The others reported decreases. Month-to-month, the number of regional airline FTEs declined 0.2 percent from May to June. Regional carriers typically provide service from small cities, using primarily regional jets to support the network carriers’ hub and spoke systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:45:22.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
