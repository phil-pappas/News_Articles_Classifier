Teaming up with its two UK sister properties Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane and Four Seasons Hotel London at Canary Wharf, the Hotels aim to raise more than GBP 25,000 in support of the Terry Fox Foundation and the Hampshire-based Brain Tumour Charity.\nVisitors of all ages are welcome to run or walk the 5 km course around the Dogmersfield Estate and enjoy an afternoon of live music, delicious food and recreational activities. Registration will open from 1:30 pm with the run starting at 3:00 pm. A dedicated area will keep the young ones entertained with face painting, archery, pony rides and zorbing. The Hotel’s Highwire Adventure rope course will also be open for children and adults alike while the culinary team at Four Seasons Hotel Hampshire will be in charge of a barbeque and hog roast. All proceeds will go to the nominated charities, and supporters will be making a great difference in the fight against cancer locally as well as worldwide.\nThe Terry Fox Foundation continues in memory of Terry Fox, a Canadian cancer victim who ran more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometres) in 143 days with a prosthetic limb to raise money for cancer research. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, as a Canadian company, has supported the charity ever since Terry’s death in 1981. In addition, Four Seasons Hotel Hampshire, Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane and Four Seasons Hotel London at Canary Wharf are proud to support The Brain Tumour Charity, the leading charity dedicated to brain tumour research in the UK.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:49:53.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
