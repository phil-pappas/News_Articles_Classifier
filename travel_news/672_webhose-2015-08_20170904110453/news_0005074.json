As Italian cities go this is one of the prettiest, thanks to its central concentration of neoclassical and art nouveau architecture. \nBut nearby Brera, a 10-minute walk away, is where you will find the coolest place to hang out this year. The area's Bohemian atmosphere extends across the tiny streets which are lined with bars and independent shops selling Florentine jewellery and clothing. \nA little farther away is the district of Navigli with its series of canals, particularly pretty at night when the lights slung between the trees are lit up and the floating bars come to life. \nTHE HOTEL \nOn the lively central, shop-filled street of Corso Buenos Aires, close to the Piazza San Babila and Central Station, the Hotel City has rooms with balconies where you can sit and watch the comings and goings. It's all about location here - the hotel is also opposite the city's famed opera house, La Scala, which has been recently renovated. Rooms in the hotel are contemporary with wooden floors and full-length windows. The city centre square is dominated by the Duomo, Milan's gothic cathedral \nWHERE TO EAT \nOn the chic shopping street of Montenapoleone is the Armani building (milan. armanihotels.com) comprising a boutique and hotel, with the all-glass upper floors home to the restaurant. \nThe bar sits on the 7th floor. In typical Armani style, the colour scheme is beige on beige with wooden shutters. But it's the view across the magnificent skyline and terraces that is the real crowd-puller. \nThe restaurant menu includes all the italian favourites, including risotto, pastas and some excellent beef, all artfully presented on large white plates. Don't miss the bombolone - an italian doughnut. Dinner is £120 for two. \nIt is also worth joining the queue at Luini Bakery (luini.it) on via Santa Radegonda. Open since 1888, this is where those in the know go for panzerotti - a dough filled with cheese and tomato which is then deep fried, and which will set you back about £3. It's just as well there are plenty of sightseeing routes in the city to help you walk it off afterwards. \nAl 91 ( ristorantepizzeria91.it ) near Maciachini metro station, is the place for veal Milanese - bread-crumbed veal cutlet which at around £10, is bigger than any pizza. \nThe family-run restaurant, with a loud and lively vibe, has rustic interiors with heavy wooden tables set inches apart Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T14:09:02.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
