It puts us in a unique position among global news providers,” said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of the New York Times Company.\n“We believe that no other news organization has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or comparable digital subscription revenue.\n“It’s a tribute to the hard work and innovation of our marketing, product and technology teams and the continued excellence of our journalism.”\nThe Times began its pay wall strategy in 2011 and has been emphasizing digital as print circulation and advertising decline. In 2012, the company said it took in more revenues from circulation than advertising for the first time.\nThe Times said separately that its profit for the second quarter jumped 78 percent from a year ago to $16.4 million. The rise in profit came amid lower costs, while revenues dipped 1.5 percent from a year earlier at $382 million. Circulation revenues grew, but failed to make up for the drop in advertising revenues.\nSecond-quarter print advertising revenue fell 12.8 percent while digital ad sales grew 14.2 percent. Digital advertising pulled in $48.3 million or 32.5 percent of total ad revenues for the quarter to June 30.\nDigital ad growth “was again driven by growth in mobile, paid posts and video,” Thompson said.\n“Expense management will remain a top priority as we head into the second half of 2015, although our emphasis on digital investment and execution is also more intense than ever.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:10:22.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
