The grave was within the precincts of a Greyfriars monastery destroyed in Tudor times. \nDNA testing confirmed their identity, while inspection showed Richard had not been a hunchback, though his spine was abnormally curved. In March his remains were reburied in an elegant limestone-and-marble tomb in Leicester Cathedral in a major public ceremony. \nThe cathedral, which prior to Richard's entombment would get a handful of visitors daily, had almost 2,000 people visit one day last spring, church officials said. \n\"We're getting used to being the place that hosts King Richard III,\" said David Monteith, the Dean of Leicester. \nThe cathedral charges no admission and relies on volunteers to deal with the stream of visitors. The modestly priced souvenirs on offer include Richard III teacups and fridge magnets. \nColombian Lilian Pantoja drove from Liverpool, where she lives, to see the tomb and the nearby battlefield. \n\"The burial of a medieval king who is the last English king that died in battle, I thought that's amazing,\" she said. \nPREPARED FOR INFLUX \nLeicester has been preparing for the influx for some time. A new \"Dynasty, Death and Discovery\" visitor centre, opposite the cathedral, contains a diorama depicting Richard's life and exhibits explaining how his remains were found and identified. \nPart of the centre juts into the car park where the skeleton was found, and visitors can walk on a plexiglass floor and see the king's former unmarked grave below. Open seven days a week, admission is 7.95 pounds ($12.40) for adults, 4.75 pounds for children under 16. \nLeicester, like many mid-sized British cities, lost much of its medieval past to urban renewal, but visitors still get a flavour of what it looked like in Richard's time. \nThe Guildhall, beside the cathedral, is 600 years old and described on the city's website as being \"one of the best preserved timber-framed halls in the country\". \nNearby, the \"Jewry Wall\" - so-called not because it was the Jewish quarter, but probably from a medieval word for legal officials - is said to be one of the largest surviving pieces of Roman masonry in England, dating to 125-130 AD. \nThe Blue Boar Inn, where Richard spent his last night, is long since demolished; a Travelodge on the supposed site now caters for the budget traveller. \nLeicester has a wide range of hotels and restaurants, among them the popular Belmont Hotel on De Montfort Street, the Indian restaurant Kayal at 153 Granby Street and the White Peacock, which features regional produce, at 14-16 King Street. \nThe city also sits in one of England's great food-producing regions. The market town of Melton Mowbray, which bills itself as England's \"rural capital of food\", hosts an artisanal cheese fair in May which this year attracted some 50 cheese makers displaying 250 cheeses, most available for free sampling. \nIn October, the town stages an annual food festival featuring a wide range of foods, including the locally produced Stilton cheese and Melton Mowbray pork pies. \nThe story is that the pies were popular among foxhunters in the 18th century. The gentry who carried them in their saddle bags would have nothing to do with the crusty pastry, which they threw to the hounds, but devoured the grey pork inside. \nThe pies may not sound appetizing to some, but Peter Cross, bakery manager for pie maker Dickinson & Morris, founded in 1851, said that, during Christmas week, some 40,000 pies \"fly out the door\" of his shop - meaning yes, pigs can fly.
