(HANDOUT/NYT) 0 of 0 African Americans go online for advice and fellowship to navigate a world unaccustomed to them as travelers. By ASHLEY SOUTHALL The New York Times \nAs I stood barefoot at the entrance to the Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Temple, a labyrinthine Hindu shrine in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala that is forbidden to nonworshippers, a man studied me. \nWrapped in a blue silk sari, I was an anomaly in the crowds of worshippers and wedding guests sweeping past. My pecan-brown skin had been tanned by the sun, my tightly coiled hair was cut in a close crop, and I spoke a foreigner’s English. There was no one like me there except my then-boyfriend, who was standing next to me with his modest Afro as we waited for my college roommate’s wedding party. \n“What are you? South African?” the man finally said. When I told him we were American, he asked again, “South African?” Finding fellowship \nThis kind of encounter with incredulity is a recurring scene for black Americans traveling to far-flung destinations, and their experiences led to the creation of the Nomadness Travel Tribe, an invitation-only collective of more than 10,000 globe-trotters spread out over 36 countries ( nomadnesstv.com ). Most Read Stories Portage Bay crow battle lands in court \nThe group began in September 2011 on Facebook as a fellowship of travelers who rely on one another as they navigate a world not accustomed to black American travelers, one that is liberating in the best cases and inhospitable in the worst. I joined over a year ago. \nThough open to any invitee with at least one passport stamp, the vast majority of Nomadness members are African Americans and women. About half are millennials, and most are strangers, the plus-ones of plus-ones. We meet up like old friends in cities from Los Angeles to Seoul, South Korea, refer to each other affectionately as tenders (a shortened slang term referring to attractive women) and JBs (short for “jungle brothers”), and snap up flights going just about anywhere in the world. \nNomadness is one of several virtual communities that have sprung up on social media catering to African Americans, who rarely find themselves the target market of tourism and hospitality companies. \nThey are carrying on a long tradition of travel media created by and for black consumers, from the “Negro Motorist Green Book,” which helped black vacationers find lodging during the years of segregation, to the professional and fraternal organizations that book large group trips, to cultural sponsors like Essence, which draws thousands to New Orleans each year for its music festival. \nLed predominantly by black millennial women, the new virtual communities rely on networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to push travelers to venture out more often and farther afield. These networks include 2-year-old Travel Noire, Soul Society and Black Adventuristas. \n“We’re here,” said Evita Robinson, 31, the creator of Nomadness. “We’re taking our stake, we’re planting our flag and we’re very unapologetic about it.” Overlooked travelers \nThe images uploaded by the black travel networks run counter to the typical profile of the international traveler. On television and in magazines, many hosts and writers are middle-aged white males, and travel media and advertising campaigns often feature people of color only as the airport and airline staff or locals. \nYet African Americans are one of the fastest-growing travel markets. Black-travel spending is approaching $50 billion on domestic travel, and about 1 in 5 black travelers take at least one international trip each year, according to a 2011 online panel study by Mandala Research. \nOn social media, that growing travel base is represented. Black vacationers zip-line through the jungles of Central and South America, hitch camel rides across the Arabian Desert, tour the ancient temples of Asia and make pilgrimages to Africa. We are even taking in the ancient ruins of Greece and relaxing on beaches in Kenya, despite warnings about increasing racist attacks in Europe and extremist violence in East Africa. \nNomadness members have been to all but a handful of countries, according to Robinson. \nLike their predecessors, the groups help black travelers figure out where it is safe to go, whether they will feel welcome once they arrive, and which activities might interest them. \nIn addition, the organizations provide tips on things like caring for natural hair while traveling, responding when someone utters a discriminatory slur, and dating interracially and interculturally abroad. And unlike blogs and books, questions are answered in real time by members all over the world. \nBut the appeal of the movement lies mainly in the imagery, and it is no accident that these sites have taken off amid a boom in visual social media. Since it began in September 2013, Travel Noire ( travelnoire.com ) has gained more than 125,000 Instagram followers attracted to a movement that is about representation, said Zim Ugochukwu, 27, who created the site to put to rest the notion that black travelers do not wander the world. \nThe community draws on contributions from more than 100 black travelers worldwide who share their experiences and expertise on Travel Noire’s website. \n“If you see somebody who looks like you in a certain destination, on a billboard doing things you never thought you could do, then that thing becomes a possibility,” said Ugochukwu, the Minnesota-born daughter of Nigerian immigrants. \nWhether traveling solo or in groups, African-American travelers are often the only black passengers on an international flight. And once we land at our destination, we can be the only black guests at the hotel, restaurant or attraction. \nAlthough people the world over have heard of famous African Americans like President Obama and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., many locals, like my fellow wedding guest in India, really do not know what to make of ordinary black travelers. \nThese experiences can be isolating, and they are part of what draws black travelers to the movement emerging on social media. \nRobinson created Nomadness after returning from a year spent teaching in Asia, and following a fruitless search for a young, diverse and energetic community where she could be vulnerable and share her experiences. One of the most common reasons people join Nomadness, she said, is “knowing that anywhere you want to go in the world, there’s someone there.” Finding deals \nIt is a movement that exists in an economy that says it should not. The Great Recession wiped out twice as much black wealth as it did white, and created the widest wealth gap between blacks and whites in nearly a generation, according to the Pew Research Center. \nThe post-recession growth of the African-American travel market has been helped by the proliferation of websites and mobile apps that make it easier to travel cheaply. \nNomadness’s members, who range from broke college students to millionaires, share tips and tricks in group files. They use messenger services like WhatsApp to spread the word about cheap airfares in chat rooms governed by a single rule, “No dinging if it ain’t dealing.” ASHLEY SOUTHALL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:37:30.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
