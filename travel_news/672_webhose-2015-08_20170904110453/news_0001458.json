The boy's name wasn't released. They were tourists from the small town of Bourgogne, near the city of Reims, France.\nThe couple appears to have died of heat-related causes, House said. An autopsy to determine the official cause of death was pending, according to the state medical investigator's office.\nThe family had two 20-ounce water bottles when they set out on the hike along the national monument's Alkali Flat trail at about 1 p.m., House said. The trail is known for crystalline-white sand dunes and ends at the edge of the Alkali Flat, an ancient dry lake bed.\nThere is no vegetation or shade, and the National Park Service warns summertime visitors to hike only in the cool hours and carry at least a gallon of water per person.\nThe high temperature at the monument Tuesday was 101, according to the National Weather Service.\nHouse said warning signs were posted in several languages, including French, at the trailhead.\nThe boy told deputies that his mother began feeling ill and complained of an injured knee about a mile and a half into the hike.\n\"So she made the decision that you guys go ahead and go on, I'm going to go back to the vehicle,\" House said. \"She made it about a hundred yards before she went down.\"\nHe said the father and son were unaware that she was in trouble and continued on the trail, making it about 2,000 feet before the father collapsed.\nPark rangers on a routine patrol found the family.\nThe sheriff's office contacted the French consulate in Los Angeles and officials there notified the family's relatives.\nThe boy's grandmother flew to Albuquerque and was reunited with him Thursday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T09:55:03.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
