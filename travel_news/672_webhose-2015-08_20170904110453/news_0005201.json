National Transportation Safety Board Member Earl Weener Ph.D. delivered the keynote address discussing how motorcoach companies can improve their internal culture of the company safety. Dr. Weener’s presentation focused on the 20-year effort to improve safety in commercial aviation, and how many of those changes can be implemented by motorcoach companies.\n“Dr. Weener’s presentation challenged members of the Bus Industry Safety Council to look at innovative, and in many cases significant ways to create an improved culture of safety in their overall operations. The motorcoach industry is the safest form of surface transportation, but we must continue to strive to do better every day. Our members went home with many additional tools because of what Dr. Weener said and because of the collaboration that takes place during the BISC meetings,” said BISC Chairman Stephen Evans, the Vice President of Safety for Pacific Western Transportation.\nThe Bus Industry Safety Council, which meets twice a year bringing together bus industry safety and compliance professionals, centered its 2015 summer meeting on collaborating with its federal agency partners. The NTSB was just one of many federal agencies to attend and participate in the event. The three day meeting also included a security specific training exercise provided by the Transportation Security Administration. Overall, attendees had a prime opportunity to get to know and build stronger relationships with their federal partners, all in the interest of improving motorcoach safety as well as security.\nSource:- American Bus Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:02:38.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
