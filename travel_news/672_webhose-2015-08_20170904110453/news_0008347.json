The Valley of the Leopard\nZambia is one of the few African countries that can pretty much guarantee the full pantheon of Africa's wildlife without having to be inside a fenced area.\nAll of Zambia's national parks and almost all of its accommodations are unfenced, and elephants, hippos, giraffes, buffaloes, hyenas and even lions are regular visitors to many towns, villages, lodges and camps even outside of national parks.\nBut to see Zambia at its absolute wildest, nothing beats South Luangwa National Park .\nThis park has one of the highest densities of big game anywhere in Africa, but vast swathes remain largely unexplored.\nEven in the \"busier\" sections along the Luangwa River visitors are unlikely to be jostling with an army of other game vehicles to get the best view of the action.\nAbove all else, South Luangwa has become feted for its leopard sightings -- anyone who comes here and doesn't see any leopards needs their eyes tested.\nSouth Luangwa National Park has one of Africa's highest densities of big game. 2. Zambia's French Riviera\nThe fashionable Lake Kariba is the largest man-made body of water in Africa, a veritable inland ocean.\nVisitors could be forgiven for thinking they're in Mediterranean Europe at times here, but when the sun sets there's no doubt they're in Africa.\nAside from the stellar African sunsets, the order of the day at Lake Kariba tends to be as follows: sunbathing, watersports, fishing, fresh crayfish, ice-cold sundowners and general relaxation.\nA luxury houseboat holiday is a particularly special way to enjoy all of the above.\nOtherwise there are numerous reasonably priced lodges, self-catering villas or campsites along the edge of the lake in and around the pretty town of Siavonga, many of which in some way capture the French Riviera feel of the area.\nAn increasing number of Zambia's wealthy elite own second or even third homes in Siavonga, with the lake just an easy 200-kilometer jaunt from the capital of Lusaka.\nJust another beautiful African sunset at Lake Kariba. 3. A walk on the wild side\nAmong safari aficionados, Zambia is feted for its guided bush walks and walking safaris.\nThough these activities aren't unique to Zambia, the level of knowledge of the guides generally is.\nWith the density of wildlife, dearth of fences and continued prevalence of traditional rural living, one of the arguments is that Zambia's guides grow up in closer proximity to the wonders of the African bush than most.\nWhatever the case, there's probably nothing more exhilarating than tracking lions through the bush on foot, and Lower Zambezi National Park has to be the best place in Zambia to do this.\nLower Zambezi National Park , Sud di Lusaka, Lusaka Zambia;\nJust a few hours' drive from Lusaka or a 30-minute chartered flight, the park is astonishingly remote and the landscapes are striking.\nThe green banks and elephant-filled islands of the mighty Zambezi flank the park on one side and a high and densely forested escarpment on the other.\nA morning bush walk can be coupled with an afternoon or even overnight canoe safari down the Zambezi for a truly special Zambian combination.\nZambia's guided bush walks and walking safaris are celebrated because of the local guides' expert knowledge. 4. A fascinating colonial heritage\nFor those with a soft spot for colonial nostalgia or in need of a quick cultural fix, a visit to the picturesque and spectacularly incongruous Shiwa Ng'andu manor house should do the trick.\nThis was the former home of a young British colonial officer by the name of Stewart Gore-Browne who came to the area in 1911 to determine the border between Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo.\nShiwa Ngandu , Mpika, Mpika Zambia;\nGore-Browne developed a deep affinity for the area and determined that when his work was finished he would return and settle in this part of Africa.\nHe came back in 1914 looking for a piece of land to buy.\nThe huge and elaborate manor house that he built, overlooking a lake and surrounded by pristine gardens, gives a number of fascinating insights into both the eccentricity and determination of its creator and the colonial heritage of Zambia in general.\nThe Shiwa Ng'andu manor house was built by a British colonial officer in the early 20th century. 5. The mighty Zambezi in full force\nWhile we've aimed here to shine a spotlight on some of Zambia's lesser-known highlights, it's impossible to leave Victoria Falls off this list altogether.\nOver the years this incredible natural wonder has exhausted all the superlatives in the dictionary in attempts to describe it, but none manage to do it justice.\nKnown to locals as \"Mosi-oa-Tunya\" (\"The Smoke that Thunders\"), spray from the falls can be seen rising high above the deep Batoka Gorge from literally kilometers away.\nOnce jaws have returned to their usual positions and eyes have stopped popping out of heads, there are an unprecedented number of adrenaline activities on offer in and around the falls.\nThese can all be washed down with a stiff drink on the banks of the Zambezi at the decadent colonial-themed Royal Livingstone , while zebra and giraffe graze on the perfectly manicured lawns nearby.\nRoyal Livingstone , Mosi-Oa-Tunya Road, Livingstone Zambia;", "external_links":
