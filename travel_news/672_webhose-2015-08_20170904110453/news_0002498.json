I zip-lined down Fremont Street in Vegas and stopped for pictures of the famous Reno sign and Truckee River. A quick detour was my first visit to Lake Tahoe.\nOnce in Seattle, we had to go to the top of the Space Needle. We did this late in the afternoon for two reasons: the prices go down after 6 p.m., and we got to see the sunset and watch Seattle go from sunlight to night lights. We also hit the Pike Place Market, the Experience Music Project Museum and ate Ivar’s famous clam chowder before moving on to Portland.\nThe Portland Rose Festival and Fleet Week were in full bloom. It was such fun to watch the parade, visit the fair, watch all the people and see the sailors stand at attention while ships pulled into port on the Willamette River. No trip to Portland is complete without a visit to the International Rose Test Garden and the famous Voodoo Doughnuts. Yes, we ate doughnuts for dinner.\nNext we drove south to Hillsboro for the graduation, then continued down the coast.\nAfter stopping at Multnomah Falls, we backtracked a bit to Astoria to drive the famous coastal Highway 101. We stopped in Seaside for a drink and a quick view, then rolled through beautiful Cannon Beach. We made our way to Tillamook, where we stopped at the Tillamook Cheese Factory for a tour and a sandwich. It was fascinating to see how the cheeses are made, and the samples were wonderful.\nAs we crossed into California, the Trees of Mystery redwood attraction was a must. We took the Sky Trail gondola ride up to the observation points to look over the treetops out to the ocean and hiked down the 1-mile path even though it was pouring rain.\nIn San Francisco we saw the famous Pier 39, Lombard Street, Golden Gate Park and Japanese Tea Garden, and the Golden Gate Bridge. That old saying of, “The coldest winter I ever felt was the summer I spent in San Francisco” is true!\nNext we ventured to San Jose for a tour of the Winchester Mystery House. The tour includes 110 of the 165 rooms of the mansion as well as the grounds. The history of Sarah Winchester, widow of William Winchester and heiress of the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. is enthralling.\nWe were running out of time, so we settled on one theme park to visit. With its 60th anniversary celebration going on, Disneyland and California Adventure won. The new World of Color light and fireworks show is worth the frustrations of the summertime crowds.\nFinally, it was down to San Diego. We always make a quick visit to the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery (my husband is a retired Navy veteran) which has views of downtown San Diego on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other. Then we enjoyed a visit to Cabrillo National Monument, enjoyed a scrumptious burger at Hodad’s and watched surfers at Ocean Beach to round out an amazing coastal trip.\nThe writer lives in Glendale.\nTELL US WHERE YOU’VE BEEN: To contribute to Your Travels, send a large, high-resolution JPEG attachment photo and a description or essay of up to 400 words to traveleditor@arizonarepublic.com.
