(File photo) - + Bicycle tours in Bangkok's historical district Several foreign aviation regulators have contacted Thai Airways International (THAI) requesting an audit, says the airline's president Charamporn Jotikasthira. \nThey include the Indonesian aviation regulator, which has notified the airline that it will come for an inspection this month, he said. \nOthers have also made contact, but THAI has yet to disclose their names. \n\"THAI is fully prepared [for the audits],\" said Mr Charamporn, adding the airline's overseas flights have already been subject to stringent checks. \nThe increased scrutiny of THAI flights came after the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) gave Thailand a red flag on June 18. \nThis was in response to the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA)'s failure to meet a 90-day deadline to correct shortcomings earlier identified by the ICAO, in particular its failure to meet aviation safety standards as it regulates aviation businesses and in the granting of air operator certificates. \n\"The level of scrutiny intensity has increased by four times from the period before ICAO red-flagged Thailand,\" said Mr Charamporn. \nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), meanwhile, gave Thailand 65 days to fix aviation shortcomings following its audit of the DCA in mid-July. \nAmong the flaws identified by the FAA was a shortage of qualified DCA staff to conduct air safety inspections of airlines -- a concern that was also raised by the ICAO. \nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will also inspect Thai aviation standards in November, Mr Charamporn said. He said THAI must be ready for intense scrutiny, and any overseas flights of the airline would face more stringent checks at their destinations. \nThe THAI president said that regardless of the results of the EASA's audit, he believes the airline will still be able to continue operating its flights to Europe as usual. \nA THAI source said the Indonesian aviation regulator requested an audit from the chief of the airline's Indonesian office, and the airline had responded saying it welcomed the inspection. The airline is waiting for further contact from the Indonesian authorities, the source said. \nThe source also said the Indonesian regulator would need to inform the DCA of the inspection. \nAnother source in the aviation industry said Indonesia wants to demonstrate the veracity of its own aviation standards. \nIndonesia banned Thai-registered airlines from increasing their flight frequency or changing the types of aircraft that fly into the country, following the ICAO's red flag. \nDCA director-general Parichart Khotcharat said the Indonesian aviation regulator has yet to submit its request for the inspection. \nAs for the DCA's efforts to address the ICAO's concerns, Ms Parichart said the agency held a training course on safety supervision last month. \n\"The training allowed officials to understand safety issues in line with the ICAO's standards,\" she said.
