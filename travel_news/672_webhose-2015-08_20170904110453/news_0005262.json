Local legend states that once the shrine went up, the problems besetting workers stopped and devotees have flocked there ever since. \nSuch shrines are not unusual in Buddhist majority Thailand, a nation which has forged a syncretic relationship with animist and Hindu traditions. \nShrines to the Hindu gods Ganesha and Shiva can be found just a few hundred metres away from the Erawan while Thais have their own version of the Ramayana epic -- the Ramakien. \nIn recent years Chinese devotees in particular have flocked to the shrine, fuelled by the belief that prayers and donations there will bring them good luck and fortune. \nThe fervour with which locals treat the shrine is so great that in 2006 a mentally ill man who attacked the statue of Brahma with a hammer was beaten to death by an angry mob. \nThe shrine has also been witness to key recent moments in Thailand's febrile political history thanks to its location at the Ratchaprasong intersection. \nThe key crossing has been taken over by both sides of Thailand's political divide at various times during recent street protests. \nIn 2010 much the intersection was the scene of a military crackdown against Red Shirt supporters loyal to ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra. \nWhen the crackdown finished a large mall opposite the shrine was gutted by fire. \nFive years on the shrine has once more been witness to violence in the capital. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
