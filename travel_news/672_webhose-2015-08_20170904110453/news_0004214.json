The national airline of Uzbekistan says it has begun weighing those traveling along with their carry-on luggage. \nThe isolated Central Asian state's carrier said that it had introduced the new regulations out of concern for \"flight safety\". \n\"According to the rules of International Air Transport Association, airlines are obliged as a rule to weigh passengers with their hand baggage to ensure flight safety,\" Uzbekistan Airlines said in a statement posted online Thursday. \nThe International Air Transport Association has, however, denied knowledge of such a regulation. \nThe airline took the statement down from its website following a storm of media interest. \nThere are very few airlines that weigh humans in addition to baggage at check-in. \nOne other exception is the Pacific island of Samoa, where obesity is rampant and the country's national carrier has introduced extra-large seats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T22:47:38.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
