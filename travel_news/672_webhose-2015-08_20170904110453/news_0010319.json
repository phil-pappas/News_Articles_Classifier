The Vatican says Friday, Aug. 28, 2015 its former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, who has been charged by church prosecutors with sexually abusing children in the Caribbean country, was found dead in his Vatican room early Friday: the Vatican prosecutor ordered an immediate autopsy. (AP Photo/Manuel Diaz, File) After work performed so far, \"and from the initial conclusions based on the macroscopic examination, a natural cause of death, due to a cardiac event, is confirmed,\" said the Vatican statement.\nThe Vatican prosecutor's office appointed a panel of three experts coordinated by a forensic medicine professor at Rome's Tor Vergata University to determine the cause of death.\nA Vatican trial against Wesolowski was an opportunity for Pope Francis to show he's carrying out pledges to punish high-ranking churchmen accused of sexually abusing minors or covering up abuse.\nWesolowski never set foot in the tiny courtroom for the trial, held in the same building where he was residing. On the eve of the trial's opening, Wesolowski was hospitalized in intensive care in a Rome hospital. Citing privacy concerns, the Vatican would only say he was hospitalized for \"sudden illness.\"\nBut before the trial was adjourned indefinitely for Wesolowski's illness, the court clerk's reading aloud of the charges gave a vivid idea of the case's gravity and sordidness.\nProsecutors alleged that Wesolowski \"corrupted, through lewd acts, adolescents presumed to be between 13 and 16 years old, in order to carry out on them, and in their presence, sexual acts\" and that at least once, the sexual abuse happened in a public place.\n___\nFrances D'Emilio can be followed on Twitter at a href='http://www.twitter.com/fdemilio%3c'www.twitter.com/fdemilio/a", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/fdemilio%3c", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/29/09/f6/e8692e86f72c44f6a76745c31ef5ba6b-6e62d76fe57f415fada429d5af89d7a4-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-29T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T16:10:21.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
