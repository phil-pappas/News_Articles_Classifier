St. Petersburg, Florida, home to the largest Pride event in the state and a longtime supporter of LGBT tourism, was selected by IGLTA’s board of directors for the 34th edition of the conference, 3-6 May 2017.\n“Not only does St. Pete have a charming downtown and incredible beaches, it also boasts major attractions like the Dali Museum and has been actively engaged in the LGBT market,” says IGLTA Board Chair Dan Melesurgo. “Our goal as a travel association is to showcase the host destination in conjunction with the conference, so we look forward to expanding the global audience for St. Pete.\nWe know our attendees are going to fall in love with it, if they’re not already fans.”\nIGLTA’s conference will take place at the Vinoy Renaissance St. Petersburg Resort & Golf Club, a historic downtown luxury property that overlooks Tampa Bay. The property is part of Marriott’s collection; the brand recently signed on as one of the association’s global partners. Downtown St. Petersburg also is home to a thriving LGBT community, drawing an estimated 250,000 people this year for the Pride Parade along Central Avenue..\n“As home to one of the largest Pride events in America, St. Petersburg/Clearwater has long been a welcoming destination for the LGBT traveler,” says David Downing, Executive Director Visit St.\nPetersburg/Clearwater. “We’re honored to be the host city for IGLTA’s 2017 Annual Global Convention, and we look forward to showing off our gorgeous white sand beaches, world-class cultural scene and unique Gulf Coast vibe.”\nSource:-IGLTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T06:23:19.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
