The balmy waters of tropical Fiji are a metre away and the stuff that crowds into my brain back home has wafted off on the breeze. My beachfront tent comes with a plug to recharge the phone but that thought floats off too. \nBarefoot Manta is home for the next few days, a small, delightfully down-to-earth resort in Fiji's Yasawa islands. Distant from the well-trod tourist routes of \"mainland\" Fiji, the Yasawas, with their rims of coral sand, set their own languid pace. \nBarefoot Manta is surrounded by a marine reserve and is named for the magnificent manta rays that feed in the adjacent channel. The resort is also home to the Vinaka Fiji volunteer programme, whereby paying guests offer their time to assist the local inhabitants with education, marine and sustainable living projects. Despite the beauty of the Yasawa Islands, life for the locals is not the paradise that first greets the visitor's eye. They struggle with below-world standards of health and poverty and limited sources of fresh water. Susan Buckland \nThis little girl is among those the volunteers work with. \nEnter Vinaka Fiji, a charitable trust set up five years ago to assist with amenities through fundraising and \"volun-tourism\" programmes. The name \"Vinaka (thank you) Fiji\" reflects the relationship of giving back to the people for welcoming them to their islands. The communities are helped to become self-supporting and encouraged to determine their needs and help plan and implement the projects. \nI opted to spend some time in the local village school with Sarah, Charlotte and Amelia, English friends staying at Barefoot Manta. In their early 20s, they enthused about the experience of combining a holiday in Fiji with lending the locals a hand. It was Sarah's fifth visit to Barefoot and she had learned to dive so she could be a marine research and conservation volunteer. Marine reserves have been set aside to ensure coral reefs and sea creatures are protected. As well as assisting with manta ray research, volunteers remove the devastating crown of thorns starfish from the reefs and teach sustainable reef practices. \nSarah pays the same amount for her accommodation and food as Barefoot Manta's non-volunteers and is fine with that. What counts for her is the camaraderie and helping to make a difference. It will be a struggle to leave when the three weeks are up, she says. Jack, a young builder from London, agrees. He has been helping to build a new school playground and has had a blast outside of working hours with local and volunteer comrades. \"People have asked if I mind paying for the experience of helping out. All I can say is that this has been one of the best experiences I've ever had,\" says Jack, glowing bronze after a fortnight in the Fiji sun. With our Vinaka Trust escort, retired teacher Tema Savu, Sarah, Amelia, Charlotte and I boated across to the village school on neighbouring Naviti Island to be greeted in unison by a room full of primary-school-aged children. An afternoon of reading and singing with them was topped off by games outside when even the shyest of the children became immersed in the fun. At the helm was Tema, a dedicated educationalist who has been heartened by the improvement in the children's reading in English and their general education. For our part, Charlotte, Sarah, Amelia and I got a kick out of helping our responsive young students. The marine research programme at Barefoot Manta is run by American marine scientists Dan Bowling and Heather Pacey. \"The manta rays don't mind our presence if we do it right,\" says Dan. However, persuading resort guests to do it right is a challenge. A highlight at Barefoot Manta is swimming with the giant manta rays as they pass through the channel. Dan and his team politely implore guests to keep their distance or they risk driving the creatures away. Susan Buckland \nEven the shyest of the children became immersed in the fun. \nInvariably the advice is forgotten at the first sighting of a manta ray. Goggled and flippering guests flounder en masse towards the creatures who understandably take off. \nI was fortunate to find myself beside one of these graceful giants before it barrel-rolled out of sight. For a few split seconds as we moved along together it seemed the entire silent underwater world belonged to us. Until a bunch of berserk flippers crashed towards us. \nTravel agents could help deter such counter-productive scrambles by including environmental guidelines in itinerary briefing notes. They could also advise the importance of mastering snorkelling skills to avoid standing on the fragile coral reefs. With pollution degrading so much of the world's oceans, the coral reefs of Fiji – and especially those of the more remote Yasawa Islands – are, in the main, still magnificent, with abundant fish life and brilliant coral formations. The marine volunteers would return to Barefoot Manta from underwater working bees with photos of the vivid coral gardens and fascinating sea creatures. Susan Buckland \nThere's still time to relax once the volunteer work is done. \nIt could be argued that \"volun-tourism\" programmes are in part a marketing strategy, particularly as accommodation is not discounted. But the model has been used quite widely in other countries. And at the end of the day, participation is voluntary.
