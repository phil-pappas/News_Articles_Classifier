Here are some useful tips on how to save money while you are exploring this amazing natural habitat. Book Your Cruise in Advance or Book on Arrival? \nThis will largely depend on when you visit the islands, as there is a stark difference between the availability of berths on cruises during the peak season in July and August when spots can be quite limited. \nIf you do look to travel during the shoulder season from April to June or between September and October, you will often find that there are plenty of boats going out on a daily basis, and you can negotiate some great deals once you arrive on the islands. For those traveling in the peak season if you book in advance you are likely to get the cruise you really want, but there still may be some good deals as operators look to fill all of the berths. Do Your Research and Find the Cruise That Does What You Want \nNot all of the cruises travel to the same destinations, and by doing your research in advance you will know what the sights are that you have to see, and you can then choose your cruise accordingly. \nMany people will opt for a longer cruise to give them more time out on the water, and even if you are looking for a luxury yacht for your cruise, you can still compare itineraries and the different islands visited to ensure you visit all of the sites that you want to see. Give Yourself Some Extra Time on the Islands for Flexibility \nOne of the best steps that you can take to allow yourself a few extra days on the islands, as this will allow you to pick and choose the right cruise for you, and those leaving at different times of the week are often more open to negotiation in order to fill their berths. \nThis certainly isn't a sacrifice if you can do it, as spending a day or two in Puerto Ayora offers the opportunity to take a few day trips, and accommodation doesn't have to be too expensive, particularly if you are staying in a hostel. Taking a Cruise or Exploring by Land? \nThe majority of people who are taking a vacation in the Galapagos islands will choose to take a cruise, but this is not the only way of exploring the islands. While exploring by land will not allow you to see as much of the islands, particularly those islands that are more remote, you can still see some of the amazing sights without taking a cruise. Day trips from the main towns on the islands will still help you to get around, and this approach can also help you to bypass some of the areas on cruise itineraries that may not be of as much interest to you. Choosing When to Travel \nTraveling during the shoulder season has long been a great way to save money on travel, wherever the destination, and this approach is certainly one that can work when exploring the Galapagos too. From being able to save hundreds of dollars on cruises around the islands, through to cheaper flights, this is a great time to travel. Another useful hint to save money on flights is to fly from Guayaquil rather than Quito , which will often trim another fifty dollars from the cost. Inexpensive Activities to Enjoy During Your Visit \nAlthough cruising can be quite costly, you don't need to break the budget every day, and there are plenty of inexpensive or free things you can do. \nHiking is a great way to see the islands, and the walk down to Tortuga Bay from Puerto Ayora is a very nice walk to a good swimming beach. If you are staying in Puerto Villamil, hiking to the Flamingo Lagoon is a nice walk and offers an amazing viewpoint of the pink flamingos. If you fancy a bit more of an adrenaline rush, take the water taxi over to Las Grietas, where you can swim and try some of the cliff dives there.
