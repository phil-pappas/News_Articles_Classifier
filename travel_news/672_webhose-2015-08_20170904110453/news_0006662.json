He is charged with felony aggravated assault and intoxication.\nA judge set the afternoon preliminary hearing in Park City so prosecutors could lay out their evidence against Hirsch, or for the two sides to present a plea deal if one has been reached.\nDaniele Bernfeld, an executive for the Paramount Pictures subsidiary Insurge Pictures, described the incident as being \"insanely painful and absolutely terrifying,\" according to public records obtained by The Associated Press. Bernfeld told police that Hirsch put her in a chokehold from behind, dragged her across a table and body slammed her to the floor, records show.\nHirsch was slurring his words that struggling to balance, the reports show, and said he had three or four drinks. He told police he couldn't remember exactly what happened, but acknowledged \"mouthing off\" a bit with Bernfeld and then defending himself when she came at him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:31:30.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
