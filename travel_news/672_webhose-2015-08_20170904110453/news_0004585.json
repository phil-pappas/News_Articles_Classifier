After around three years, the gap widens, with former private school students earning roughly £4,450 (or 14 per cent) more. The study attributes this pay gap to factors including assertiveness, awareness and confidence. Ouch. But hope is not lost for anyone who didn't go to a private school. It's never too late. In our experience as confidence coaches, working with women from all sort of educational and cultural backgrounds, the thing we’ve noticed that really sets the high achievers apart is actually the right kind of mind set and a good dose of self-belief. • How private schooling is deciding the millionaires of tomorrow The power of a belief system Anyone can create the conditions for confidence that private schools boast Photo: GETTY When it comes to graduate salaries, privately educated students don’t necessarily earn more because they received a better standard of teaching in English, maths, science or any other subject. More likely, in our experience, is that the culture and environment of these schools instils a belief system in their students from a much younger age, which gives them a more positive sense of what’s possible and a level of confidence in their own worth. These are invaluable skills, and it perhaps does give privately educated students a head start in some ways. However, it is absolutely not something that is exclusive to those from more privileged backgrounds. Anybody can create it for themselves. In fact, outside of schools, families can work to make these belief systems part of everyday life. We have seen it time and again with our clients – those people who start to really understand their own value radiate confidence, and that’s something people really respond to. • Screw your CV: Here's how to really succeed at work Perception is projection Meryl Streep as the formidable Miranda Priestly in 'The Devil Wears Prada' Photo: Rex Whether we realise it or not, each and every one of us projects our own sense of value on to the world, every day. It’s in the way we talk, the way we carry ourselves and the way we react to others. This is why confidence and assertiveness is such a crucial life skill. When we talk about helping people to be confident and assertive, many people worry that we’re going to turn them into some kind of pushy, arrogant or aggressive Devil wears Prada character. But assertiveness isn’t about steamrolling over others to get what you want at any cost. It’s simply about having the strength in your own beliefs to take action and see things through. It’s something we refer to in our coaching as ‘magic’ - but all that really means is ’intention plus belief plus action’. This kind of magic is something that absolutely anyone can achieve. • Women are losing custody of their ambition - and they don't even know it Have the confidence to get paid what you’re worth Negotiating a pay rise means knowing your own worth Photo: Alamy When it comes to negotiating a pay rise or a promotion, having confidence in who you are is vital. Think about the following four tips before your next appraisal or job interview - and don’t be afraid to go out and get what you want. Know your value Prepare a mental list of all the skills and qualities you possess and think about the value they add to the company. You have a lot to offer an employer, but most importantly, you have to believe it yourself or you will never convince anyone else Use your body language Having the confidence to look someone in the eye is a powerful way to show interest and enthusiasm. But your posture and the way you project yourself also speak volumes. Having a positive attitude and body language can truly change the way people interact with you Be authentic Don’t feel that you need to start acting like somebody else in order to get ahead. Many people feel the need to hide their softer side or even their accent in order to be taken seriously, but being confident and comfortable with whom you are as a whole goes a long way Connection not perfection There was an interesting study recently that showed that men are 30 per cent more likely to enjoy five or more promotions than a woman, regardless of whether she has children. The reason was that many women only feel confident when applying for a job or asking for a promotion if they are ‘perfect’ and fit every single criteria. Whereas men would tick off three quarters of requirements and wing it on the others. Again comes down to an attitude, and if you can have the confidence to embrace your excellence - rather than waiting for perfection - then you can make your own opportunities. Regardless of where you went to school. Places are currently available for The Good Witches of the North “Grab Your Wand” sessions on October 6 and 7.
