Questions about security and data protection will immediately follow those looks, as consumers look to understand what exactly will happen to their personal information once it is trusted to an abstract “new” technology. But what many consumers and businesses don’t realise at first blush is that not only is Cloud technology secure, it’s also a necessary advancement that will allow local and central governments to stay up-to-date in a hyper-connected world. Cloud has become a term used across the world to denote an agile, data-rich infrastructure that is low in cost and available on demand. However, within the context of local and central government, it often seems hard to see the practical benefits of using Cloud. Cloud benefits To start using Cloud, organisations need to take a number of issues into account, including security, choice of public versus private Cloud, legislation in regard to where data is held, and integration with existing infrastructure. But on the flipside, this technology gives organisations a new option and a new set of tools to tackle issues in an increasingly digital world. Introducing Cloud to government infrastructure offers myriad potential benefits, such as efficiency gain, the improvement in outcomes, and innovation. A virtual environment can be secured, audited and governed in the same way as on-premises applications With a Cloud infrastructure, files can be accessed by teams of analysts and approved government officials from multiple locations, allowing them to complete work simultaneously and remotely. Cloud security Many may ask whether sharing computing resources opens government organisations up to attack and viruses. However, with Cloud, it is possible to contain any malware or viruses in a virtual environment, maintaining the integrity of the evidence chain. If the correct solutions are selected, this virtual environment can be secured, audited and governed in the same way that you would manage on-premises applications. Managing your Cloud infrastructure in this way allows you to have complete control and visibility, enabling you to implement access controls to satisfy the diverging demands of IT and government protocol with embedded security. Rather than panic at the thought of moving government data around, it’s important to take a minute to assess the solutions available and the benefits they can offer. If Cloud deployments are managed correctly and assessed with security implications in mind, it is possible to reap the benefits while maintaining a secure infrastructure.
