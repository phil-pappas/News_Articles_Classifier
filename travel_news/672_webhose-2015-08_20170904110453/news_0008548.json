What once seemed the stuff of sci-fi films is now a reality, from the fridge that knows you’re running low on milk to the lightbulb whose colour and brightness you can control through your smartphone. Even for those who grew up before the internet, technology is becoming easier to use, leaving us with more time to spend with our friends and family and doing the things we love. Smart energy in the kitchen The kitchen is one of the areas of the home which has benefited the most from rapid technological development in the past few decades. Fridges that scan food and text you to alert you when it’s past its best – and even suggest what meals to make from the ingredients you’ve accumulated – are becoming de rigueur, while smart hobs you can pre-programme to the optimum temperature are aiming to make careless burning and curdling a thing of the past. In a modern version of the Teasmade, you can switch on the iKettle – the world’s first Wi-Fi kettle – from the comfort of your own bed, choosing from four temperature settings depending on the kind of hot beverage you require. After syncing the iKettle with your smartphone, you can set it to turn on as you arrive home from work or set an alarm for it to brew at a certain time in the morning, avoiding early arguments about whose turn it is to make the tea as well as earning you an extra five minutes in bed. Ikea’s new range of wireless-charging furniture features inbuilt pads on which to rest your phone, charging it without the need for wires and plugs Technology is also helping to take the tedium out of preparing meals. All-in-one assisted appliances such as the Thermomix are capable of weighing, chopping, whisking and blending ingredients, all within a single device. Thermomix’s creators claim the average household can save hundreds of pounds a year as it can do the job of at least 12 kitchen appliances – including bread-maker, slow cooker, steamer, blender and food processor – reduce energy bills and help cut food waste. Smart energy in the living room Another major trend is to do away with unsightly cables and wires. Ikea’s new range of wireless-charging furniture features inbuilt pads on which to rest your phone, charging it without the need for wires and plugs. From bedside cabinets to lamps with pads in their bases, the new range means you have to worry about one less thing before going to sleep at night. Given how busy our lives have become, technology has also developed to help us keep all of our notes, ideas and doodles in one place. Taking inspiration from those who love the feeling of putting pen to paper, Moleskine has developed a series of Cloud-connected notebooks that allow budding creatives to sketch and make notes on the physical pages before they are uploaded via the special page markings to become fully workable digital files. Smart energy heating Another huge asset in living in ever more connected homes is that there’s no longer any need to pay over the odds for basic services. Technology is giving us the power to move from paying for estimates of power use to being able to monitor precisely how much energy we are using, and help us save it. This is one of the key benefits of smart meters, which monitor your exact energy use and are currently being rolled out across the nation, while smart prepay (due to go live in mid-2016) will help you spread the cost of the energy you use. Also part of the smart upgrade, Google’s Nest thermostats allow you to set a heating schedule to the degree, and provide monthly home reports to summarise energy use and further tips on how you can save more money. “I just had a new heating system installed, so thought I’d try the Nest thermostat,” says James Gwinnell. “I can now make sure the house is warm on arrival, and can also see how high my wife has set the temperature.” The old adage that bathrooms and electricity should never mix has been dispelled by a number of forward-thinking gadgets When it comes to heating rooms more quickly or cooling them down, all-in-one devices such as Dyson’s AM09 fan heater are leading the way in energy efficiency. With no potentially dangerous blades or cumbersome grilles to clean, the oval-shaped design distributes air powerfully and evenly to heat the entire room and can lower energy bills by up to 20 per cent when used in conjunction with air conditioning when cooling. “We recently turned down our central heating in anticipation of summer, but the Hot + Cool heater has come to the rescue during cold evenings,” says John Kay. “At the other end of scale, we have a south-facing garden room which is a sun-trap and we’ve already made use of the ‘cool’ mode which appears equally efficient.” Smart energy in the bathroom The old adage that bathrooms and electricity should never mix has been dispelled by a number of forward-thinking gadgets, as well as aiding our personal hygiene. The Oral-B SmartSeries Pro 6000 electric toothbrush prides itself on being the first smart toothbrush to communicate with a paired smartphone via Bluetooth, providing real-time feedback on your brushing habits. It claims to remove 100 per cent more plaque than manual brushes, and feeds your performance back to its app to help you perfect your brushing technique. While the world continues to change rapidly, being able to rely on our appliances to work harder and make our lives easier is a welcome development. If only members of the family were so predictable. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T21:34:01.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
