We’re very excited to have the opportunity to fly nonstop between London and San Jose and we’re sure this route will prove very popular with those looking for a holiday that’s definitely out of the ordinary.”\nMauricio Ventura, Costa Rica’s minister of tourism said: “British Airways’ new service from Costa Rica to the United Kingdom is wonderful news and demonstrates the success of our strategy to attract premium airlines to our country.\n“In the last 12 months alone we have seen an increase of 12.9 per cent of tourists from the United Kingdom visiting Costa Rica, staying an average of two weeks, helping to make a valuable contribution to the Costa Rican economy.\n“Europe is a priority market for Costa Rica. So the start of this new route by British Airways will help attract tourists from across Europe, and specifically from the United Kingdom, making it much easier for them to visit all the wonderful places Costa Rica has to offer modern holiday-makers.”\nEach of the new twice weekly flights will offer 48 seats for customers travelling in Club World, 24 in World Traveller Plus and 203 in World Traveller. With stylish cabin interiors and on-demand in-flight entertainment, British Airways also offers free in-flight dining, a full service bar and a generous baggage allowance.\nDuring summer months the flights will operate on Wednesday and Saturday, departing from Gatwick at 11:55 and 11:00 respectively, arriving in San Jose at 15:45 and 14.50 respectively, with an average flying time of 10 hours and 50 minutes.\nIn winter, flights will operate on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, departing at 10:15 on a Tuesday and Saturday, arriving in to Costa Rica at 15:35, and departing at 11:25 on Thursday, arriving in to Costa Rica at 16:45. Flight times during the winter months will be 11 hours and 20 minutes.\nReturn fares start from £2,532 in Club World, £1,100 in World Traveller Plus, and £687 in World Traveller, including all taxes and charges.\nThe new long-haul route to San Jose, follows the airline’s recently launched route to Kuala Lumpur from Heathrow and a new Gatwick route to Funchal in Madeira. Gatwick also launches new routes to Sharm El Sheikh and Vienna later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:00:31.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
