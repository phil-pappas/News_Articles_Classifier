Slimy rocks, subterranean waterfalls and more stalactites than you can throw a stick at (be advised: don’t). It’s all well-lit and spacious, so uncomfortable mining helmets aren’t needed, nor is there any squeezing through potholes. Outside, the attraction is dinosaur-themed, with life-size models of T rex and co dotted about the place – creating a sort of 1970s-style Welsh Jurassic Park. A free app with maps and “treasure hunt” is available but download it beforehand because the phone signal is stone age. There’s also a farm and play barn, with crazy golf coming soon.\nRelated: Wales’ perfect new wave: Snowdonia’s inland surfing lake\nFun fact\nStalagmites grow one cubic millimetre a decade. One cave has a 2m by 40cm pillar. Do the maths.\nBest thing(s) about it\nThe audio tour in Dan-yr-Ogof cave – it’s priceless. Tommy and Jeff, the local farmers who “discovered” the caves in 1912, chat as though they’re down the pub. As the name suggests, the Cathedral Cave boasts an awe-inspiring vaulted ceiling and crystal-clear river for an aisle. It’s open for weddings, too, for those up for a big family day out.\nWhat about lunch?\nFairly standard stuff at the on-site cafe, so a picnic is the best option. Otherwise, there’s the Pen-y-Cae Inn about a mile away that does no-nonsense pub grub.\nListen up … for an audio tour in the Dan-yr-Ogof cave.

Parking is free.\nValue for money?\n£13.75 adults, £9.50 kids (3-16 year-olds) – but after three hours you’ll have done everything.\nOpening times\n10am (last entry at 3pm), seven days a week from April to October, showcaves.co.uk .\nVerdict: 6/10", "external_links": ["http://www.showcaves.co.uk/", "http://www.showcaves.co.uk/app.html", "http://penycaeinn.com/"], "published": "2015-08-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:06:12.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
