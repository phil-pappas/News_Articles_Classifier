As before, passengers are allowed to carry \"one cabin bag per passenger (excluding infants travelling on a parent's lap) weighing up to 10kg with maximum dimensions of 55cm x 40cm x 20cm\". These restrictions are stricter than many other airlines, including easyJet and British Airways, which both allow bags up to 56cm x 45cm x 25cm on board. Since December 1, 2013, however, Ryanair passengers have also been permitted to bring along \"one small bag up to 35 x 20 x 20 cms\". But this policy has caused problems. After flying to Rome with the low-cost carrier, Telegraph Travel's Adrian Bridge reported that there was not enough room in the overhead lockers to accommodate all the extra stuff people are now bringing on board. \"The solution? When Ryanair officials decide the lockers can take no more, passengers yet to board have to leave their cabin bags on the tarmac, from where they are collected and placed in the hold,\" he said. Ryanair staff often check the dimensions of bags in a rigid frame. If it doesn't fit, and if any part of the bag or wheels protrudes, be aware that Ryanair is still inflexible over hand baggage size and weight, and the cost of getting it wrong remains steep: €50/£50 for putting the oversize bag in the hold (double this if you return with the same bag on the way home). For information on travelling with a musical instrument or sporting equipment, see Ryanair's website . On busy flights, your bag may have to go in the hold at the gate. There is no charge for this - but you will have to wait at the baggage carousel at the other end. Having to give up one's cabin bag at the last minute can be avoided by purchasing priority boarding, which is charged from €/£2 per person per flight.

There is no weight limit on the second, smaller bag, but it must fit under the seat in front of you. Can I book a hold bag on a single leg, and travel hand-luggage only on the other? Yes. Indeed, remember that you must book hold luggage for both legs of your journey when reserving your flight online - otherwise you will likely have to pay a higher charge for adding a case at a later date. Am I allowed any items in addition to my two cabin bags ? An overcoat is allowed, but duty-free purchases made airside at the airport, as well as umbrellas, must fit within the two cabin bag allowance. Anything else? Ryanair allows adults with a child aged 8 days to 23 months travelling on the parent's lap to carry a baby bag up to to 5kg in weight in addition to their own cabin baggage allowance.
