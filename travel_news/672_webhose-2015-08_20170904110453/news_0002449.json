Two planes have crashed in midair near an airport in southern San Diego County. Source: AP \nTWO small planes have collided in midair while approaching an airport in southern San Diego County, killing at least four people and sparking fires in a remote field where the wreckage landed, authorities said. \nThe collision occurred about three kilometres northeast of Brown Field Municipal Airport, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said. \nBoth planes — a twin-engine Sabreliner jet and a single-engine Cessna 172 — were approaching Brown Field, Gregor said. The Sabreliner jet and a single-engine Cessna 172 were approaching Brown Field Airport. Source: AP \nThe aircraft caught fire when they hit the ground and broke apart, said Nick Schuler, a division chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. \n“It appears it was a very violent crash, as you can tell by both aircraft being in multiple pieces,” Schuler said. \nFirst responders initially reported three fatalities, but as they inspected the wreckage which was strewn across a quarter-mile area, they determined that at least four people were killed, he said. \nThe Sabreliner crashed on a grassy slope and the Cessna fell within the bounds of the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge. \nCrews extinguished several brush fires where the planes came down. One firefighter was taken to the hospital after he suffered a heat-related injury, Schuler said. \nBrown Field, a former Naval auxiliary air station, is in the Otay Mesa area about 15 miles southeast of downtown San Diego, near the border with Mexico. \nThe FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, Gregor said. Pieces of the aircraft were scattered around the crash site.
