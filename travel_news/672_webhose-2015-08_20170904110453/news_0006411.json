The agreement also moves the event to the second Sunday in October from the traditional date in late-August.\nIn addition, Norton Sports Health announced today that it has signed on to be presenting sponsor of the IRONMAN® Louisville for an additional five years. Norton has been presenting sponsor since 2013 and has provided medical support services since 2007.\n“With its downtown finish line, considered among the most exciting in the sport, Louisville is one of the most vibrant IRONMAN venues on the circuit,” said Philip LaHaye, vice president, North American operations for IRONMAN. “Last year we announced a date shift to October, which will provide participants an enhanced athlete experience. This paved the way to a new five-year contract that allows us to continue to work with the incredible people of Louisville to deliver this outstanding event.”\n“The IRONMAN Louisville event represents the preeminent brand name in endurance competition, and we are delighted to continue our long-standing relationship through 2019,” said Louisville Sports Commission President & CEO Karl Schmitt. “We’ve had tremendous support from the Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau, Louisville Metro and Oldham County government agencies, Waterfront Development Corp., facility operators and the local hospitality industry to make this happen.”\n“Every year, our community comes together to embrace and support this event. Businesses and citizens have helped create great experiences for our visitors as they swim, bike and run through neighborhoods, towns and rural areas in Louisville and Oldham and Henry Counties,” Schmitt continued.\nThe 140.6-mile triathlon is comprised of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run on a course that takes advantage of the Louisville Waterfront, urban core and proximity to bucolic, rural settings. This year’s event sold out in March as 3,200 participants registered to enter the Ohio River through a rolling start at the docks near the new Doc’s Cantina restaurant. The scenic bike course winds through eastern Jefferson and Oldham Counties and bisects LaGrange, where thousands of spectators cheer on the athletes in an energetic atmosphere. The run course passes through Old Louisville, Churchill Downs, home of the famous Kentucky Derby, and the University of Louisville, showcasing many of the community’s local assets.\n“IRONMAN is a great event for the city. These exceptional male and female athletes are successful businesspeople, and we love having them in town to show off what makes our city such a great place to live and do business,” said Mayor Greg Fischer. “If that wasn’t enough to celebrate, this event pumps $5.2 million into our economy each year – that translates to $26 million during the next five years.”\nSince it was first held in Louisville in 2007, more than 16,000 IRONMAN participants from across the United States and around the world have visited the region and spent approximately $36 million in the local area. Charitable groups in Louisville and Oldham County have earned several hundred thousand dollars and thousands of service hours, providing support for the event through The IRONMAN Foundation.\n“Norton Sports Health recognizes the importance and prestige that hosting an IRONMAN event has for the Louisville community, and we are thrilled to continue in our role as presenting sponsor through 2019,” said Steven T. Hester, M.D., MBA, Norton Healthcare system senior vice president and chief medical officer. “We also look forward to providing Norton Healthcare’s medical team to oversee the athlete recovery center in the Kentucky International Convention Center and support IRONMAN personnel in monitoring athletes during the course of the event. It is critical to us that all the participants have a safe and rewarding experience as they compete in such a demanding and inspiring event.”\nSource:- Louisville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T06:05:58.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
