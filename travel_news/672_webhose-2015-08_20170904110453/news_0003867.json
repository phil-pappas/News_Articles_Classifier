Bruce Irvin and the first-team defensive line looked dominant. Granted, it was against the Seahawks’ second-team offensive line so keep that in perspective, but Irvin and his fellow rushers, Cliff Avril and Michael Bennett, were causing chaos during Saturday’s scrimmage. Irvin has always had the physical tools to be a pass-rusher, and he had 6.5 sacks last season in a limited role as a pass-rusher. But coach Pete Carroll said Irvin “is the best he’s been, the strongest he’s been, the heaviest he’s been and the most fit.” Irvin sped around Seattle’s backup tackles on Saturday and consistently put pressure on the quarterback; there’s no tackling in practice, especially quarterbacks, so it’s hard to know how many sacks Irvin and the defensive line actually had. But it was clear that they were creating consistent pressure off the edge.\n2. Receiver Chris Matthews and cornerback Richard Sherman had some good duels. Matthews is gigantic; officially listed at 6-5, 218 pounds, he looks bigger on the field. And Sherman, we know, is tall for a corner. Before the scrimmage, when receivers and corners went head-to-head, Matthews made a tough, jump-ball catch over Sherman down the sideline. Sherman had great coverage and ran with Matthews step for step, but Matthews used his size to come down with the ball. It was a great play. In the scrimmage, Sherman locked up Matthews, best I could tell. I didn’t see every time they squared off — there’s a lot to watch in a scrimmage — but in the times I did see them paired together, it looked like Sherman clung to Matthews’ every step. Matthews isn’t a burner so he won’t run by many defensive backs, but if he’s going to be a contributor for this team, he’ll have to make the kind of tough catches he made against Sherman.\n Boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert at CenturyLink 3. Linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis is trying to corral one of his best attributes — his speed. Ever since the Seahawks drafted Pierre-Louis last year, they’ve talked about his speed and ability to play in space. But there’s a difference between being fast and knowing how and when to use that speed, a balance Pierre-Louis is working to find. One play that stood out from the scrimmage: The offense faked a handoff, Pierre-Louis took a few steps forward before, realized it was a pass and tracked the tight end who slipped into the flat. Pierre-Louis broke up the pass in the flat. He said a year ago, he likely would have been a few steps late on that play. Pierre-Louis explained the balance he’s looking for like this: “The whole defense is fast,” he said. “I am pretty quick, and that’s an attribute a lot of people see, even the rest of my teammates. But now it’s controlling that speed. It’s just making sure I’m in the right position. Our defense is a sound defense, and everybody has a job to do. So if I use my speed and run out of my gap, I’m exposing someone else. So it’s really just controlling that speed.”\nAnd from Condotta:\n1. Kasen Williams has a long road to go to make the roster — but he took a good step in the right direction today. It’s still a longshot that any of the undrafted free agents here will make the final 53-man roster at receiver. But Kasen Williams did what he could to at least make the coaches notice him today with four catches, tying Doug Baldwin for the most on the team. Williams also had a couple of catches in the one-on-one sessions before the scrimmage started. His most impressive play might have come when he got a step behind Cary Williams down the sideline and then corralled an R.J. Archer pass for about a 25-yard gain or so, using his body and leaping ability to finish the play. Said Carroll afterward: “He’s a tough now. His senior year (at Washington) didn’t look like the senior year people probably expected or he expected and he came back from a very, very difficult injury and he may not have really had all of his confidence back. He’s battling out there. He’s a real tough, aggressive, physical type of receiver and we love his style so we will let it keep going. We certainly can go to him. You can throw to him and he’s going to make plays, you can see that. He’s just like the guy he was when we saw him coming out his senior year of high school.”\n2. The center position continues to be one of great intrigue. As has been noted here and elsewhere, Drew Nowak was suddenly running with the ones at center on Friday and did so again today when the scrimmage began, after it appeared a few days ago as if Lemuel Jeanpierre had the inside track for the job. Jeanpierre also got some work with the ones. But Carroll said Nowak is definitely still in the running for the starting center job. Asked afterward about having said earlier that Jeanpierre would be the starter if the team played a game today, Carroll said, “that was earlier. Drew Nowak is doing a really good job right now. He’s getting a great shot to show us how he fits together in there. That was a real key spot for competition and that’s one. Drew has been doing a good job.” Also of note today is that Terry Poole continued to work at right tackle and Mark Glowisnki at left guard. Poole had been at left guard and Glowsinski at right guard behind J.R. Sweezy. Carroll said the team wants to give Glowisnki a shot on the left side, where the starter is Alvin Bailey (who worked with the first team throughout after Kristjan Sokoli had worked there some during the week) and see what he can do. Asked later if it’s possible the team could play a rookie on the OL this year, Carroll said yes. “Anything could happen a month from now with four games coming up and all that, so we’ll see what happens. Done it before so you know we could do it again.”\n3. Other than Richard Sherman, the starting cornerback jobs are also getting intriguing. The assumption the first week has been that Cary Williams will be the team’s starter at right corner and Will Blackmon at nickelback since that is how it has almost always looked out here when the first team defense has taken the field. That’s how it looked again today, as well. But Carroll afterward said he was pleased by the play of the corner spot as a whole and that Williams and Blackmon will have to continue to fight to keep those spots. Carroll specifically mentioned Blackmon, Tharold Simon and recently-acquired Mohammed Seisay as competing at corner and Marcus Burley and Tye Smith, in that order, for the nickel spot. “I want to leave the competition on here for the nickel spot and Cary’s got to push, too,” Carroll said. “Cary’s got all the experience you would ever want but I don’t want to just close the door on the other guys. Tharold Simon is going to come back in a couple of weeks now, too. So it was great to see Mo Seisay make a good play today. He is starting to gain enough play where we can get an evaluation on him. Will Blackmon is also in the competiton over there so we’ll just let those guys keep going over there and see what happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:20:34.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
