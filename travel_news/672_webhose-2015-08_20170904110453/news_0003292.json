Gladiator Games Ambitiously, the Museum of London this week brings gladiators back to the site of London’s only Roman amphitheatre, found at the Guildhall in the City. It was here that gladiators fought 2,000 years ago, and in a somewhat less brutal re-enactment of those devastating battles, fighters will gather to prove their physical supremacy and secure their future. These Gladiator Games promise to be quite a spectacle but there’s more in store throughout the event. As well as watching the combat, the audience can participate in less rabid pursuits. Roman pottery classes, music lessons and cookery sessions are all on offer, while there’ll also be a chance to tour Roman ruins and explore the streets of Londinium.

The London Triathlon See the capital’s toughest athletes battle it out at the annual event, with individual distance levels ranging from a 400m swim, a 10km bike journey and a 2.5km run to a 1.5km swim, 80km bike race and 10km run. thelondontriathlon.com 4. Wilderness Festival With wild swimming in a wooded lake, natural saunas, vintage stalls and even camel rides, Wilderness was the first major UK festival to shift the focus from its music bill to a more holistic idea of fun, involving crafts, theatre, forest raves and good food. Lavish banquets along long wooden tables sell out each year, with dishes from chefs Angela Hartnett and Raymond Blanc. There is a cookery school too, along with a debating forum, a fiction tent and yoga masterclasses. Not that the music is to be sniffed at. This year sees Bjork, Perfume Genius and Hercules & Love Affair down at the pretty Oxfordshire estate.

This sailing regatta takes place over a week in the demanding five-mile-wide channel between the Isle of Wight and the south coast of England. The partying happens afloat and on shore. Cowes has really got its act together ashore, including huge screens live-streaming the racing action and loads of music, bars and activities for all ages. The fireworks are a must-see: they take place at 9.30pm on the harbour on the last Friday, after an RAF Typhoon fly-past.

Fantastic Four The American sci-fi film based on Marvel Comics’ longest-serving superhero team of the same name opened across UK cinemas yesterday with critical reviews. While the film might feel “grindingly dour” with an “infectious” gloom, you have to “at least admire its attempt to introduce a few new flavours into the ice-cream stall”, describes the Telegraph’s film critic Robbie Collin .
