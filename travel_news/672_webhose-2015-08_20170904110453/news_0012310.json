The upstream reservoir on the town’s Mitford Estate works by storing up to 1.4 million cubic metres of water when river levels are high – enough to fill more than 560 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\nIn September 2008, severe and prolonged rainfall caused 1,000 properties in the town to be flooded and forced hundreds of people to evacuate.\nThe scheme has also created 17 hectares of new habitat for local wildlife. 3,500 endangered white-clawed crayfish have been relocated upstream of the River Wansbeck – one of the last places in the UK where the native species has a stronghold. Construction has allowed for ‘refuges’ and continued habitat to ensure the crayfish will continue to thrive.\nThe project has been jointly delivered with Northumberland County Council, which provided £12 million in funding – one of the largest partnership contributions the Environment Agency has secured.\nSir Phillip Dilley, Environment Agency chairman, said: “With one in six people at risk of flooding in England, flood schemes like Morpeth have a key role to play in protecting people and property, and provide a valuable boost to the local economy. Creating large-scale habitat is also vital to ensuring the survival of the country’s endangered species such as white clawed crayfish.\n“The success of this scheme is down to the way it has been developed in collaboration with others. In particular, the funding from Northumberland County Council is among the largest contributions received under the partnership funding regime.\n“We are making record levels of investment, spending £2.3 billion over the next six years to reduce flood risk to more than 300,000 properties in England, and successful partnerships like this, with local authorities and business, will be key.”\nConstruction work on the scheme began in 2013 and has included a new flood wall and embankment along the riverside, over 368m long, including three new flood gates. Repairs and improvements to existing defences have also been carried out, with efforts to ensure that the look of the defences fit with the history and character of the town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:04:21.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
