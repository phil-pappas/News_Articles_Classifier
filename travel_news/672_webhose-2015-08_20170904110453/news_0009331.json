Baltimore ranked 30th on Cvent's list of top 50 convention destinations, falling two spots from its position at No. 28 last year. Baltimore's place on the list has fallen each year since 2012 when it was ranked 23rd by Cvent, an event management software company. This year's ranking comes as Baltimore's tourism and convention industry has struggled to drive business following riots and protests earlier this year. Orlando, Fla., topped the list, followed by Las Vegas and Chicago. Some of Baltimore's nearest competitors also secured higher spots. Washington, D.C., ranked sixth; Philadelphia came in at No. 21; and Charlotte, N.C., ranked 25th. Competitor cities that ranked lower included No. 35 National Harbor, Arlington, Va., at 36th and Pittsburgh, No. 43. The full list is available here . Cvent evaluated more than 5,000 cities to compile the list, and ranked each based on event booking activity in the Cvent Supplier Network and number of meeting venues in the area. \nWant Baltimore Travel news in your inbox?
