After touching down at the capital’s Noi Bai Airport at 5.10pm (local time) Sunday afternoon, aircraft VN-A861 was officially welcomed by Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Trong, Executive Vice President of Vietnam Airlines. \nThe aircraft will go straight into operation on domestic services between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from 4 August, before making its international debut on Vietnam Airlines’ nonstop routes to London in September – making it the first Asian airline to operate both Boeing and Airbus’ modern next-generation aircraft at the same time. The airline will also become the first to operate the new B787-9 Dreamliner nonstop between Southeast Asia and Europe. This is the first of a total of 19 Boeing 787s which will be delivered to Vietnam Airlines by 2019, as part of a major fleet upgrade programme which also includes 14 Airbus A350-900 XWBs. The new aircraft will replace the airline’s entire fleet of widebody aircraft, dramatically enhancing its product offering while also maintaining its cost-effectiveness on long-haul and intercontinental routes. Vietnam Airlines’ next Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is due to be delivered on 10 August 2015. The latest extension to Boeing’s super-efficient 787 family, the B787-9 Dreamliner can fly farther, and with more passengers and more cargo, than the B787-8 - but with the same exceptional environmental performance: 20 per cent less fuel usage and 20 per cent fewer emissions than the aircraft it will replace. The new aircraft will feature fully flat beds in Business Class, with in-flight WiFi services also set to be introduced. Passengers in all three cabin classes will benefit from larger windows and stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity and cleaner air, lower cabin pressure and a smoother, quieter ride. Frequencies between Hanoi/Ho Chi Minh City and London Heathrow will rise from four flights to five or six flights per week following the deployment of the Dreamliners, before increasing to a daily service for Summer 2016. Return fares from Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi currently start from £441 or £525 per person respectively, inclusive of taxes.
