I want s’more! ... One of the 10Below Ice Cream flavours, S’mores Galore. Picture: Instagram/10Below Ice Cream Source: Supplied \nIN 2013, people became obsessed with the Cronut — lining up for hours just to get their hands on the popular croissant-cross-doughnut pastry. Now there’s another shop in New York City that has foodies, and the curious, queuing around the block. \nBy 6pm on a Wednesday, 10Below ice-cream shop has already sold out of its most popular flavour — I Love You a Latte, which blends cold-brew coffee with chocolate chips, reports the New York Post . \nAnd yet Edis Kandic, 24, still has to wait 30 minutes for an Oreo-packed Cookie Monster in a paper cup. \n“Last Thursday I tried to get it, but I waited 30 or 40 minutes without the line moving!” says Mr Kandic, who had first seen the ice-cream on his Instagram feed. Line up! <div class=\"iframe-alt\">(Frame content direct link: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5Q6N3PGiD5/embed\">https://instagram.com/p/5Q6N3PGiD5/embed</a>.)</div> \nEver since it opened in July, tucked between restaurants and spas in Chinatown, foodies from far and wide have been waiting up to three hours to get a taste of 10Below, which serves an American twist on Thai ice-cream rolls. \nThe frozen concoction is created by pouring liquid homemade ice cream onto a cold plate reaching temps well below zero (-18 degrees Celcius). Employees mix in toppings, flatten it out like a crepe, and then scrape it into ice-cold rolls with a putty-knife-like tool. The result is five cute little rolls with toppings ranging from fresh strawberries to a blowtorched marshmallow and Tiny Teddys. The next big thing in ice-cream? <div class=\"iframe-alt\">(Frame content direct link: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/6sEHMqmiGv/embed\">https://instagram.com/p/6sEHMqmiGv/embed</a>.)</div> \nThe store offers eight different flavour combinations, each US$7 ($9.80). \nUnlike placing a Cronut in a box, the trendy dessert takes about four minutes to create. But that’s part of the show: The ice-cream makers call you over to their cold plate before they begin so you can get a front-row view — and an ideal spot to snag a pic with a smartphone. \nLeave it to three 20-somethings to create this summer’s most Instagrammable dessert. \n“I kind of quit my accounting job and decided to do this,” founder Richard Tam, 23, says while mashing bananas and Nutella with a slowly freezing crème anglaise ice-cream base to create the shop’s Monkey Business flavour. Beary cute <div class=\"iframe-alt\">(Frame content direct link: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/6TRTZXGiHE/embed\">https://instagram.com/p/6TRTZXGiHE/embed</a>.)</div> \nMr Tam first saw the freezing technique in a Facebook video of a friend’s trip to Thailand, and he jumped at the chance to turn his ice-cream-making hobby into a career, enlisting his brother Wilson, 28, and friend David Chen, 22. \nRecent university grad Tam found a space in Chinatown — where he grew up — and rounded up his college buddies to work with him behind the cold plates, leading to the shop’s laid-back atmosphere of bros working in backward caps while T-Pain blasts through the speakers. Making the ice-cream <div class=\"iframe-alt\">(Frame content direct link: <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5GQ75tGiCL/embed\">https://instagram.com/p/5GQ75tGiCL/embed</a>.)</div> \nLiliana Ma, 23, lives down the street from the shop and has been waiting for the right time to swoop in. \n“Me and my boyfriend would check [the line] almost every day,” she says, comparing her Monkey Business treat to “having Beyoncé serenade you in ice-cream form. \n“Every single bite was the perfect blend of Nutella and frozen banana.” \nAlbert Hu, 23, who waited 40 minutes for a Strawberry Shawty, is less effusive with his praise. “It just tastes like ice-cream,” Hu says. “You could get it anywhere else, but the roll-up is a good presentation.” Ice Cream 22:45 \nIs ice cream simply fat and sugar-laden junk food or is there some nutritional goodness?
