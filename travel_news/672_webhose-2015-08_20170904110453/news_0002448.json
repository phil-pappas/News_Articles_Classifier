After the company's experts presented him with sketches, edits were integrated, plans were finalized and the AmericanMuscle team began to transform Johnathan's car into the vehicle presented at the show. A portion of the proceeds from the event were also presented to Make-a-Wish's Philadelphia chapter. Overall, Andrew and Steve Voudouris and their team amassed more than $55,000 in contributions for the national nonprofit organization.\nAfter the Make-a-Wish festivities portion of the AmericanMuscle Car Show program, designer and fabricator Chip Foose named Brad Brallier of New Horizons, Pa. the winner of the 810-horsepower, 5.0L V8 MMD by Foose 2015 Mustang GT.
