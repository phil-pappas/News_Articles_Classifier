New series 9 picture released 4 Aug 2015 (Photo: BBC) We're still 46 days from the new series (yes, we're counting) but here is a brand new picture of Clara and the Doctor running away from an explosion on an unspecified planet in the opening episode The Magician's Apprentice. Doctor Who series 8 to arrive on Netflix next month... but not for UK fans 18 Jul 2015 For those who missed out when it was shown on BBC One, Peter Capaldi's first series as the Doctor will arrive on Netflix next month. Viewers in the US will get to see it first, when it hits on 8th August. Then it will arrive in Australia and New Zealand on August 31. Here in the UK, however, there is still no date (so anyone looking to legally binge-watch will have to buy the DVD boxset). Series one to seven of \"New Who\" are available to watch on Netflix UK, however, so it's likely to turn up eventually. Classic episodes of Doctor Who were removed from Netflix UK in 2013 – much to the chagrin of fans – though they are currently being aired on Freeview's The Horror Channel . As well as all the modern-day Who series, Netflix US users have access to 18 classic stories, beginning with the show's sixth, The Aztecs starring William Hartnell, and ending with Sylvester McCoy's penultimate serial The Curse of Fenric. Watch the full Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con 15 Jul 2015 Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Michelle Gomez and Steven Moffat took questions from The Nerdist's Chris Hardwick and members of the audience at the 2015 Comic-Con in San Diego. Now BBC America has uploaded the full video to YouTube. First series 9 trailer released 9 Jul 2015 The full-length trailer for series nine, first shown during the Comic-Con panel, has been released online. The season premieres on September 19, and according to an an interview Peter Capaldi recently gave to Entertainment Weekly it will have \"an epic sweep... I think the villains and monsters reflect that. Great new ones, brilliant old ones and some very scary creatures looming in stories with real emotional ambition.” This trailer has all that, plus a first glimpse of Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams meeting the Doctor... read more Doctor Who at Comic-Con: series 9 will have Vikings 9 Jul 2015 Jenna Coleman, Peter Capaldi and Michelle Gomez at Comic-Con 2015 (Photo: Rex) We're still a few hours away from the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con in San Diego, but news has already begun to trickle out. Filming in Wales has ceased for two weeks as Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Michelle Gomez and executive producers Steven Moffat and Brian Minchin have headed over to the States to take part in this year's event. Peter Capaldi has already been out and about, taking photos with fans in the queue for Hall H (one of the many enormous auditoriums in the San Diego Convention Center. It looks like this , if you're curious). The Los Angeles Daily News has even been Storifying the sightings on Twitter and Instagram. #docorwho !

They have also been answering fan questions for the Press Association, which is worth watching if only for Capaldi's story of accidentally soaking himself in an emergency shower while looking for food during a break in filming in a power station. The Doctor Who panel begins at 10.30pm UK time and the Doctor Who Twitter account has been repeatedly and not-remotely-subtly hinting that \"something special is coming\", so there's sure to be some exciting announcements. Something special is coming soon? We suggest making an appointment for around 10.30pm tonight on this very feed... pic.twitter.com/IRpa5iuKhk — Doctor Who Official (@bbcdoctorwho) July 9, 2015 Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman to appear in Lego Dimensions 8 Jul 2015 He may be able to fight off aliens and monsters, but how will the Doctor cope when he can't bend his knees or elbows? Lego Dimensions, the hotly anticipated new video game due out next month, will feature a Doctor Who world. The news was announced at a preview event at Comic-Con, which officially begins on Thursday. Players will be able to play as every incarnation of the Doctor from the show's history – John Hurt's War Doctor included – and when the character dies they will be regenerated into the next Doctor in the series. Each Doctor will be even matched with the Tardis interior from his time on the show and players will be able to choose which version of the theme tune they want as well. Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman and Michelle Gomez will provide the voices for their characters in the game and Daleks and Cybermen will be among the villains. The game will go on sale on September 29 and be available for PS4, Xbox One, Wii U, Xbox 360 and PS3. Peter Capaldi is reprising his role as the 12th Doctor in #LEGODimensions . Find out more July 8 at #SDCC pic.twitter.com/UzVV23n70J — LEGO Dimensions (@LEGODimensions) July 6, 2015 New series 9 image released 3 Jul 2015 (Photo: BBC) The BBC have released a new, decidedly atmospheric-looking picture from the forthcoming series. No word yet, however, on which episode it's from or what the Doctor is up to. Series 9 finale director announced 1 Jul 2015 Rachel Talalay on the set of series 9 (Photo: BBC) This year's finale double bill will be directed by... [drum roll]... Rachel Talalay. The two episodes, numbered 11 and 12, have been written by Steven Moffat. And having brought us the two-part closer of series eight ( Dark Water and Death in Heaven ), we already know that Talalay is up to the job. A Thick of It reunion on Doctor Who 5 Jun 2015 Rebecca Front, Peter Capaldi and Chris Addison in The Thick of It (Photo: BBC) There will no doubt be far less swearing than Rebecca Front is used to when in the company of Peter Capaldi, as the doyenne of British comedy is to appear in a guest starring role for a two-part episode of the ninth series of Doctor Who. She will appear in the two-parter featuring UNIT and the Zygons that Jemma Redgrave and Ingrid Oliver have already been confirmed to appear in... read more Will River Song be back? 26 May 2015 Alex Kingston and Matt Smith in The Angels Take Manhattan (Photo: BBC) All the signs – well, two – point to River Song (Alex Kingston) making a return to Doctor Who at some point in the future. She is dead, of course, but given her and the Doctor's intertwining, time-and-space-hopping storyline and her repeated reappearance, it's entirely possible. In an interview with the Radio Times , Steven Moffat said that he had not ruled it out. \"It entirely depends on whether we've got a good story... I have a sort of worry about keeping anybody around in the Doctor's life for too long. Because he's the man who leaves. He's the man who outlives everybody: that's his story. In the end it's the boy in his box, and he's alone. In the end if we had a great story, we'd do it.\" Russell T Davies , the man behind the recent Channel 4 sex-triptych Cucumber Banana Tofu and Moffat's predecessor, is, apparently, particularly keen on seeing the Doctor and River reunite. According to Moffat: \"He [Davies] said, 'You can't be done with River! No, no, no. Capaldi and Kingston, it's a sex storm!'\" Kingston herself has also hinted as much. Speaking at MegaCon (a convention in Florida), she said: \"All I can say is… spoilers! But what I will say is the sonic screwdriver that I had in Silence In The Library, which had been given to me by the Doctor, is not the sonic screwdriver that has been seen… yet,\" adding, \"I haven’t been told I’m done [on Doctor Who].\" Meanwhile, here's the latest update from the Doctor Who Instagram account. It's Ingrid Oliver, once again on set and in costume. Unfortunately they've censored the good stuff. Hello again! It's great to have #IngridOliver back? Here's Ingrid rehearsing a scene. #DoctorWho #BTS #BehindTheScenes #Osgood #UNIT #DrWho #whovian #fandom A photo posted by Doctor Who Official (@bbcdoctorwho) on May 24, 2015 at 5:41am PDT Bafta New York to celebrate Doctor Who 13 May 2015 Bafta Cymru and Bafta New York have teamed up for a special Doctor Who event taking place tomorrow to celebrate 10 years of \"New Who\". There is to be a screening of the episode Listen , starring Peter Capaldi, followed by a Q&A with Steven Moffat. A lucky 220 people will be in attendance. Chairman of BAFTA New York Charles Tremayne said: \"Doctor Who is such an iconic part of British television culture that it's always a privilege to celebrate its enduring success here in New York. \"The last 10 years since the re-launch in Cardiff have been among the most memorable of its many years on air.\" He added: \"Apart from some great backstage stories, it will be great to hear from Steven how they keep Doctor Who so fresh and part of the zeitgeist around the world.\" Osgood isn't dead after all 8 May 2015 Ingrid Oliver as Osgood (Photo: BBC) Osgood was lovely; we liked Osgood. And then, during the series eight finale Death in Heaven , she was brutally killed off by new arch-nemesis Missy (Michelle Gomez). But, it seems that Ingrid Oliver will be back in the role of Osgood next series after all, such is the beautiful flexibility of science fiction. She will be returning for a new two-parter (written by Peter Harness) alongside Jemma Redgrave as UNIT chief Kate Stewart and they will be facing those familiar Whovian baddies (the clue is in the picture above), the Zygons – who were last seen in 50th anniversary episode The Day of the Doctor. Here, fleetingly, are both Oliver and Redgrave on the set of series nine in Cardiff. And, as a bonus, Oliver looking really happy. How pleased is #IngridOliver to be back as #Osgood? We love it! #DoctorWho #OsgoodsBack #BTS #behindthescenes #UNIT #Dancing A video posted by Doctor Who Official (@bbcdoctorwho) on May 9, 2015 at 12:06am PDT Doctor Who and science 2 May 2015 Truthfully, we've not spent a great deal of time pondering the science of Doctor Who because, surely, it's all made up, right? Well, it seems there might be more truth to the science than we think. Or at least there's enough to flesh out a whole book. On 4 June, BBC Books will publish The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who by Simon Guerrier and Dr Marek Kukula. The blurb says: Doctor Who stories are many things: thrilling adventures, historical dramas, tales of love and war and jelly babies. They’re also science fiction – but how much of the science is actually real, and how much is really fiction? The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who is a mind-bending blend of story and science that will help you see Doctor Who in a whole new light, weaving together a series of all-new adventures, featuring every incarnation of the Doctor. With commentary that explores the possibilities of time travel, life on other planets, artificial intelligence, parallel universes and more, Simon Guerrier and Dr Marek Kukula show how Doctor Who uses science to inform its unique style of storytelling – and just how close it has often come to predicting future scientific discoveries. This book is your chance to be the Doctor's companion and explore what's out there. It will make you laugh, and think, and see the world around you differently. Because anything could be out there. And going out there is the only way to learn what it is . Rufus Hound is terribly excited 29 Apr 2015 As we learn from this new behind-the-scenes video, Rufus Hound is pleased as punch to be on the set of Doctor Who. He's playing a character called Sam Smith in the episodes The Girl Who Died and The Woman Who Lived, alongside Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones . We see him sat in the BBC's studio in Cardiff during a script read-through, with Peter Capaldi flanked by both Hound and Williams. Fortunately it looks like Hound managed to keep his cool. Doctor Who wins a Bafta for its special effects 27 Apr 2015 Remember that T-Rex wandering through London at the beginning of series eight? Or the creepy two-dimensional creatures from Flatline ? Or the alien that hatched the new moon? Well the teams that created those nifty effects have just bagged a Bafta. The Bafta Craft Awards, which honours British TV talent from behind the scenes, took place last night in London. Doctor Who's special effects were created by the companies Milk VFX, BBC Wales VFX and Real SFX, who collectively took home the award for Special, Visual and Graphic Effects - making it their second in a row after also winning last year for the 50th anniversary episode, The Day of the Doctor . They beat the likes of Atlantis, Ripper Street and Sky's David Attenborough’s Conquest of the Skies 3D to the award. Here be monsters 22 Apr 2015 The BBC have released pictures of a couple of monsters that will be appearing in the next series. The first will be seen in episodes five and six, The Girl Who Died and The Woman Who Lived, both of which are currently being filmed. (Photo: BBC) What we don't yet know is what on earth they actually are but we do know that they're at Cosmeston Medieval Village in the Vale of Glamorgan (thanks to Wales Online ), which has been transformed into a Viking village for filming purposes and is closed to the public until May 2. The same location was also used in the episode Robots of Sherwood last year. Here is director Ed Bazalgette having a chat with this giant metal being. (Photo: BBC) Did you know that Ed Bazalgette is, in fact, the same Ed Bazalgette who was the lead guitarist in the Eighties rock group The Vapours? Yes, the band that released the one-hit wonder Turning Japanese. So let's revisit that old classic while we're here. Happy birthday Peter Capaldi 15 Apr 2015 The man himself celebrated his 57th birthday yesterday while on the set. And it looks like the crew were nice enough to get him a birthday cake.

Maisie Williams, who is known to millions as Arya Stark in Game of Thrones, has begun filming a guest role for the long-running sci-fi series Doctor Who . On her first day on set, Maisie Williams said: “I'm so excited to be working on Doctor Who as it’s such a big and important part of British culture. I can’t wait to meet the cast and crew and start filming, especially as we’ll be shooting not too far from my home town [Williams was raised in Bristol].” We can expect to see two new period adventures titled The Girl Who Died, written by Jamie Mathieson and Steven Moffat, and The Woman Who Lived by Catherine Tregenna.
