We are using a terminal that is unable to sustain the carrying capacity resulting in overcrowding and poor infrastructure in terms of toilet facilities, car park, air conditioning, insufficient immigration counters, baggage carousels, luggage X-rays machines, check-in counters, amongst other amenities”.\n“There are no GST counters for tax refund under the Tourists Refund Scheme causing disappointment to tourists departing at KKIA T2. But more worrisome is that we have also compromised our security by mixing international and domestic passengers at the terminal”, said Tan.\nThe Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi disclosed that relocation was set for January 1 this year but was delayed pending the outcome of several applications made by the budget carrier, and now the 1 August 2015 deadline has passed.\n“Passengers are made to suffer under horrendous conditions at the old Terminal 2. To add insult to the injury, a 6% GST is charged for atrocious facilities,” Tan pointed out.\n“Malaysians, particularly Sabahans, are ashamed that foreign tourists have to put up with the inconveniences at the dilapidated Terminal 2. We have waited patiently for some years for the Ministry of Transport and AirAsia to find a mutually acceptable solution but it appears that the Ministry is indecisive.”\n“Due credit ought to be given to AirAsia for bolstering air connectivity to Sabah and boosting tourist arrivals to the State. The industry welcomes the recent announcement by Aireen Omar, CEO of AirAsia to make Sabah a key international hub. However, it is imperative that MOT makes a decision whether to relocate AirAsia to KKIA T1 or AirAsia to build its own terminal,” Tan concluded.\nSource:- MATTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T01:04:55.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
