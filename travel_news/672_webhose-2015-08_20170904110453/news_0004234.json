However, museum President Christine Howard says more than half of them are in various states of disrepair, and it has hired an expert to spend three days per week repairing them. \nBoard President Tom Burke says the museum has received a $50,000 matching grant that could double the size of donations. He says gifts of at least $1,000 will be rewarded with a placard on a windmill with the donor's name. \nInformation from: The News-Sun, http://www.kpcnews.com \nThink your friends should see this?
