Operated with an Airbus 330-300 offering 30 seats in Business and 275 in Economy, the additional flights will allow even more connection opportunities for customers flying from the Middle East, the U.S., Europe and Africa.\nFor the Doha-Asmara route, all flights are operated with Airbus A320 aircraft in a two-class configuration with 12 seats in Business Class and up to 132 seats in Economy. The Asmara expansion comes only nine months after the Eritrean capital was first introduced in December 2014 and demonstrates the growing demand for this route.\nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said: “Qatar Airways is committed to continually enhancing the five-star experience we offer to all our customers and this further expansion is in direct response to a growing demand on these popular routes. We are delighted to offer even more opportunities for our customers across the globe to connect through Doha’s state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport to both Eritrea and Bangladesh, flying on board one of the youngest fleets in the industry.”\nQatar Airways has seen rapid growth in just 18 years of operation and today flies a modern fleet of 163 aircraft to 151 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. At this year’s Skytrax Awards, the airline won Airline of the Year, Best Business Class Airline Seat and Best Airline in the Middle East.\nCustomers flying Qatar Airways can also enjoy the newly launched in-flight entertainment system, Oryx One, with up to 2,000 movies, TV shows and entertainment options available to view on board.\nDoha-Asmara schedule from 7 September 2015:\nMondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays\nQR1443 Departs Doha 21:30hrs, Arrives Asmara 01:00hrs (next day)\nTuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays\nQR1444 Departs Asmara 02:00hrs, Arrives 05:20hrs\nDoha-Dhaka schedule from 9 December 2015:\nDoha-Dhaka double-daily schedule\nQR634 Departs Doha 01:45hrs, Arrives Dhaka 09:30hrs\nQR636 Departs Doha 08:55hrs, Arrives Dhaka 16:40hrs\nDhaka-Doha double-daily schedule\nQR635 Departs Dhaka 10:40hrs, Arrives Doha 13:50hrs\nQR637 Departs Dhaka 20:00, Arrives Doha 23:10hrs\nSource:- Qatar Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T09:30:02.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
