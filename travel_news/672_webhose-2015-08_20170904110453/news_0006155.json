Visitors can play as many times as they want for the admission price of 2,500 forints ($8.80; 8 euros). TripAdvisor recommends it as one of the best Budapest attractions, currently ranked 18th out of more than 420 things to do in the Hungarian capital.\nPalfi opened the museum in April 2014 with his personal collection.\n\"Our aim is to collect exciting and the most popular models from all eras,\" Palfi said. \"The oldest model is from 1871 and the first modern pinball machine is from 1947.\"\nDespite obtaining a government permit, the museum quickly got into trouble with the tax office, which objected to the initial pricing scheme and drew no distinction between the free-play exhibit and slot machines in bars that cost money and offer prizes.\nThe museum closed in May because Palfi did not want to risk the possibility of large fines but a July court ruling favouring the museum and a new ticket system alleviating the tax collectors' concerns allowed it to reopen.\nThe museum will host a pinball tournament in November, its 128 places filling up in 30 minutes. Players from a dozen countries will compete in the three-day event.\nMachines include all-time favourite themes like Star Wars, the Simpsons, Indiana Jones and even a Bally table inspired by \"Pinball Wizard,\" the hit song by The Who.\n\"This can offer people the possibility of going back in time, of returning to their childhood,\" Palfi said. \"Others can also experience what machines we played on 20 or 30 years ago.\"\nMarvin Fessler, a 20-year-old tourist from Switzerland, said he found out about the museum on the Internet and had played only computer pinball before.\n\"I only know pinball from Windows, that little game, and this is the first time for real play on a machine,\" Fessler said. \"It's quite fun.\"\n___\nOnline: http://flippermuzeum.hu/en/\n___\nThis story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the museum owner's first name to Balazs.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T09:55:16.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
