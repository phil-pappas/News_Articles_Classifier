Published on : Wednesday, August 12, 2015\nSaint Lucia is celebrating its century-old cocoa industry with a choc-a-block schedule full of cacao-related activities for the month of August.\nThe heritage of cocoa on Saint Lucia, an island in the eastern Caribbean, dates back to the early 1700s. Today, there are several plantations on the island, all of which have been harvesting and producing cocoa for centuries. In celebration, the month of August has been declared the “Month of Chocolate”.\nAtlyn Forde, Assistant Director of Marketing UK and Europe at the Saint Lucia Tourist Board, said: “Chocolate Heritage Month recognises the role cocoa and its beloved by-product, chocolate, has played in its history. Visitors will have the opportunity to learn the process of making chocolate, from bean to bar and also the wellness benefits attributed to it.”\nTravellers can expect four weeks of chocolate-related fun with an exciting programme full of chocolate tastings, chocolate infused spa treatments, choc-tails and chocolate infused dishes, bean to bar experiences, chocolate making workshops, cocoa plantation tours, Cocoa-Rina dances, and a chocolate heritage trail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:41:33.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
