This summer, UNESCO designated areas of Burgundy's Côte de Nuits and Côte de Beaune vineyards, along with Dijon's ancient center, as World Heritage Sites because of their cultural significance in wine production, which began in the Middle Ages. Exquisite cuisine, stone-built towns, medieval abbeys, château hotels, and bike rides past vineyards and canals also await. In Burgundy it's easy to combine a visit to top French wine regions with other pleasant pastimes—all just a short train ride from Paris. \nBy Linda Cabasin Sign in to leave a comment Top News Use of this site indicates your consent to the Terms of Use.
