Revenge.\nIn São Paulo, a security guard and a police officer had just been killed.\nIn Uberlândia, a prison guard had been killed on his way home the day before the massacre.\nIn Manaus, a sergeant from the national paramilitary police had been murdered as he came out of a bank.\nFailed by the state\n“These cases are fairly frequent,” said Rafael Alcadipani da Silveira, an expert on the police and a member of the Brazilian Forum on Public Security.\nAlcadipani explained that police often mete out their own justice in Brazil because they feel let down by the state, especially in the cases of killings of unprotected off-duty officers.\n“What happens is that if you see your friend is killed and nothing is done, you take things into your own hands and avenge your friend,” he said.\nCrime statistics in Brazil are often incomplete and unreliable and Alcadipani says an official estimate of 500 police officers killed annually is not even half the true number.\nSeventy five percent of those killings involve off-duty officers, according to the latest Brazilian Public Security Yearbook.\nAlcadipani said around 80 percent of police have had a close colleague who was murdered, while 52 percent say they have trouble providing for their families, given that civil police officers earn only around $865 a month.\nWill of the people\nLarge portions of Brazilian society seem happy to put up with state lawlessness if it’s directed at criminal suspects.\nEven vigilante justice by ordinary citizens gets a sympathetic hearing on social media forums and in commentaries on news sites.\nPhotographs of mob lynchings — including one in which a young man was tied to a post and beaten to death in the far northeastern town of São Luis de Maranho — regularly appear in newspapers without arousing protest.\n“If they killed bandits, you could say that was a good thing. Brazil is in an undeclared war,” ran a typical comment on Band News after the site published the security camera footage of the São Paulo bar killings.\nDespite strong suspicion of police involvement in the three recent massacres, few expect convictions anytime soon.\nEven in Manaus, the senior local police officers remain in their posts and little progress has been made, despite a month-long investigation.\nIn São Paulo, officials have acted quickly to launch a probe and on Tuesday announced that at least 10 people had been involved in the executions, with security officers the main suspects.\nHowever, analysts say that successful prosecutions are rare.\nCamila Dias, an expert on violence at the University of São Paulo, said that “death squads” operate almost with impunity.\n“Almost all the massacres that take place in São Paulo have military police involvement. The dynamic of the executions, the use of masks, the timing, the large numbers of victims — all this is a model that gets repeated,” she said.\n“Sadly, many times we see police participation, but it can’t always be proved in court.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:22:18.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
