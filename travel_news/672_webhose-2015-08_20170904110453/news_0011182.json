This one of a kind attraction will feature no less than 100 traditional battle vessels. ”Gala Soro will involve about 100 traditional boats that have not been seen for 1-2 centuries” added Amon DJobo.\nMeanwhile, 25 professional national and international divers/photographers will participate in the underwater photography competition. The final agenda of the Alor Marine Festival is the Gala Dinner which will take place at Batu Putih Beach featuring a sumptuous meal of seafood freshly caught by local fishermen and cooked with various traditional recipes.\nMeanwhile, as the Alor Marine Festival is ongoing, the Festival Adventure Indonesia will feature 5 main activities, which are: diving, mountain trekking, cycling, photography, and cultural tour.\n“The dive spots will be around the islands of Kepa, Alor, Ternate, and Pantar. There will also be mountain trekking where participants can view the magnificent sceneries of white sands and step on hot sand at the foot of the mountain” said Adi Gerimu, Chief Executive Officer of Way 2 East Indonesia.\nSource:-Tourism Indonesia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:32:04.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
