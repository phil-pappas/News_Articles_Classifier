Jari-Matti Latvala and his Volkswagen co-driver, Miikka Anttila, took victory at a whole-stage average speed of 125.444km/h (79.473mph), making it the fastest rally in history. The Finnish duo, using the Michelin LTX Force S4 soft-compound tyres that were introduced in 2014, completed back-to-back wins in the race, holding off Sebastien Ogier and Julien Ingrassia, also in a Volkswagen, by 13.7 seconds, and eclipsing the record set in the same race three years previously by Sebastien Loeb, the nine-times world champion. With top speeds of around 200km/h and its famous jumps, this rally is always very exacting A Finnish winner was not unexpected. Since the event that now bears the name Rally Finland was first staged - in September 1951, as a 1,700km endurance race - it has been dominated by home drivers. Only eight times has the winner come from another country. Hannu Mikkola and Marcus Gronholm lead the Finnish roll of honour with seven wins apiece, Markku Alen six, Tommi Makinen five and Timo Makinen four. Latvala, who also won with Ford in 2010, joins a list of three-time winners that also includes Osmo Kalpala, Simo Lampinen, Juha Kankkunen and Loeb, the most successful overseas driver. Rally Finland is one of the most exciting rounds of the World Rally Championship These “Flying Finns” are clearly at home on the superfast gravel roads that pierce forests, hug lakes and are punctuated by the blind crests that launch the cars into flight and have helped to make Rally Finland the country’s leading sporting spectacle. Indeed, from the mid-Fifties, the race featured stages as we recognise them today – dominated by fast straights and cornering speeds that would not disgrace a tarmac circuit. But it is the sheer variety of surfaces, says Pascal Couasnon, Michelin motorsport director, that make Rally Finland such a rigorous test of performance. The Michelin LTX Force S4 was submitted to harsh treatment, but very little wear was noted “Today’s WRC gravel tyres have to be so versatile,” Pascal says. ‘They need to deliver grip, performance, and durability as a function of the different characteristics of the eight rounds that take place on dirt – which speaks volumes for what the engineers at Michelin Motorsport have achieved.” In 2003, on the rally’s famous Ouninpohja stage, Markko Martin’s Ford covered almost 60 airborne metres at more than 160km/h. (The secret, as any pilot knows, is not so much in the flight as in the landing.) After 2004, that stage was temporarily split into two sections because its average speed topped the 130km/h that the championship organisers regard as a desirable limit. After a couple of years it was reinstated, with token chicanes but little change in overall character. “With top speeds of around 200km/h and its famous jumps, this rally is always very exacting,” Couasnon says. “This year, the Michelin LTX Force S4 was submitted to particularly harsh treatment, as witnessed by the new speed record. But very little wear was noted.” Not on the tyres, perhaps. But has anyone asked Latvala and Anttila how they feel? It’s not easy being a Flying Finn.
