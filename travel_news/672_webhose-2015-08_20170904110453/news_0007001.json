The stock surged by as much as 11.3pc after the company, which moved its listing from Athens in April 2013, posted adjusted first-half profits of €219m (£156m), far surpassing investor expectations for €194m and up 31.2pc from 2014. Overall volumes grew by 3.8pc but adverse currency movements, including the collapsing Russian rouble, saw net sales revenue slip by 1pc to €3.2bn. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 3 rose to €164.7m from €129.2m. Despite having been previously based in Greece, the company's two biggest markets are Russia and Nigeria. While conditions in the former remain tough as Western sanctions over Ukraine take their toll, in troubled Nigeria, which is Africa’s biggest producer of crude, the group enjoyed a robust performance. “Obviously oil at $50 [a barrel] is not great news for them, but we have been focusing on the things we control,” said Dimitris Lois, the chief executive, who highlighted the company’s successful ‘Share a Coke’ marketing campaign in the country. The bottling group has also proved resilient in war-torn Ukraine, where it has stepped up its promotional activities in the face of a “fragile” consumer environment. The bottling company switched its stockmarket listing two years ago to London from Athens Photo: Alamy Greece now only accounts for about 5pc of group volumes and its business in the country, which recently imposed capital controls amid fears it would crash out of the euro, “maintained positive momentum”. Nevertheless, Coca-cola HBC cautioned that the wider economic outlook in Greece remains “uncertain”. Last week, the bottling world was transformed by Coca-Cola Enterprises' proposed merger with its counterparts in Germany and Spain in a €28bn three-way deal . Mr Lois said “there was no role to play for Coca-Cola HBC” in that transaction. However, he added that the bottling company might consider taking part in industry consolidation once its margins return to pre-financial crisis levels and the business has grown through smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. “Then, if there is an opportunity for further expansion obviously we are open,” Mr Lois said. Shares were up 7.7pc at £14.25 in afternoon trade. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T23:12:31.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
