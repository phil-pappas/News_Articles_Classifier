They demand the authorities to reconsider these vital projects and encourage investment there according to strict regulations in order to raise the level of the provided services. \nThey said that marine tourism was not up to the desired level not commensurate with its various beaches and parks and the waterfronts lack high-quality tourism services. \nSaleh Al-Gelaud a citizen said: 'The region lacks high quality entertainment with competitive prices which would attract citizens and visitors. The existing existed marine tourism projects lack means of safety and organization and also are very expensive.' \nMeanwhile one investor Badr Al-Rashidi said that the activity of renting marine entertainment suffers from the scarcity of investors poor infrastructure and lack of visitors or tourists confirming that some locations have no restaurants and buffets that attract visitors and increase investment opportunities. \nHe said: 'There are some restaurants and cafes on the waterfronts but they are not well-equipped; therefore the authorities pay annual compensation to investors due to the low turnout and losses incurred.' \nAnother investor said that summer vacations and holidays were the only season for marine activities but the demand becomes weak in winter explaining that the waterfronts of Dammam and AlKhobar have no dedicated boats for fishing or cruising in contrast to Half Moon and Azizia beaches. \nMuhammad Salman owner of a cruise boat said: 'Investment in marine tourism is profitable but there are several obstacles including the suspension of licenses for walks and boat rentals at Half Moon Beach. I am still trying to get a license to start my business there.' \nAs for the price of rental Salman said that it depended on the site the time taken and also the weather.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T00:23:08.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
