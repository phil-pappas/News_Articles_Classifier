Beach Whiskey ™, a meticulously crafted, super-premium American whiskey, is set to launch this fall.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150826/261453LOGO\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150826/261454\n\"Over the last decade, the spirits industry has seen significant growth in both market size and share,\" said J. Smoke Wallin , co-founder and CEO of Beach Whiskey and CEO of Taliera , a brand incubator and global sales, marketing and distribution agent. \"At the same time, global fascination with American whiskeys and the explosive growth of flavors in the category means the time is right for a new brand like Beach Whiskey.\"\nBeach Whiskey (SRP $27.99 , 750ml) is carefully crafted in the United States from corn at partner distilleries to produce a clean and crisp base, before filtering and blending to exact specifications. The team at Beach Whiskey spent much of the past year tasting whiskeys and flavors and testing those profiles with consumers and trade experts to perfect the recipes and final product.\nAt launch, the Beach Whiskey portfolio includes Original (40% ABV / 80 proof), Bonfire Cinnamon™ (35% ABV / 70 proof), and Island Coconut™ (26% ABV / 52 proof).\nBeach Whiskey celebrates the beach life and all that comes with it… parties, sports, relaxing, good music, and having fun. Even the packaging – an etched label on an embossed sea glass bottle – is designed to evoke the spirit of the beach life, and it's a love of the beach that brought the Beach Whiskey creators together. In addition to Wallin , founding investors of Beach Whiskey include TV and radio personality Billy Bush , and entrepreneurs Andrew McGinnis and Kenny Dichter .\nWallin , a native of Longboat Key, Florida , said while growing up he spent all his free time either at the beach or in and around the water. \"Because we all love the beach, we also share the responsibility for protecting it. Beach Whiskey believes in preserving the world's water and beaches, and by promoting the beach lifestyle, we hope to raise people's awareness of this precious natural resource.\"\nAndrew \"McG\" McGinnis , co-founder and SoCal native, is an avid surfer, waterman and beach volleyball player, who grew up playing beach sports and living the beach life in Santa Monica , Malibu and on Lake Tahoe. \"Beach Whiskey is about combining my love of whiskey with my love of the beach,\" said McGinnis. \"It's about creating a fun and delicious whiskey that can be enjoyed at a daytime beach party or by a bonfire at night.\"\nBeach Whiskey will be featured at the Hospitality Executive Exchange (HEE), a gathering of food and beverage industry leaders, at the beach on Amelia Island, FL ( August 29-September 2 ) where Bush will be giving the keynote. \"I love the idea of combining fine whiskey with the beach life,\" said Bush . \"Beach Whiskey provides the right mix of fun with great flavors. I'm excited to be a part of this ground-breaking brand!\"\n\"We are absolutely thrilled to be the first conference to introduce Beach Whiskey to the Hospitality Industry, and having Billy Bush as our welcome keynote speaker is the icing on the cake,\" said Jen Robinson , CEO/Duchess of The Pineapple Group LLC, which owns and manages HEE. \" Beach Whiskey is definitely a brand that we want as a long-term partner, and where better to showcase it than at the beach.\"\nSimply delicious and smooth, Beach Whiskey cuts across traditional beverage categories and appeals not only to whiskey aficionados but also to anyone who loves a great cocktail and a fun time in the sun. \"Beach Whiskey is exceptional!\" said Kendall Lockwood , Indianapolis Craft Mixologist and GM of the Ball & Biscuit, who created signature cocktails for the brand. \"It is wildly versatile – great straight, on the rocks or blends beautifully with a variety of flavor profiles in cocktails.\"\nMichael Tolley , CCO/Beverage By Design agreed. \"As a seasoned beverage trainer, bar consultant, and a drink recipe developer, there is nothing I enjoy more than a spirit in the raw! Beach Whiskey is one that can stand on its own, conceived in an era of craft, not misery. A spirit of today, for today… Beach Whiskey! I'll have mine on the rocks.\"\nBeach Whiskey will be initially available in Southern California and Florida , with a selective rollout planned in major markets during early 2016.\nAbout Beach Whiskey™\nBeach Whiskey was founded in 2015 by entrepreneurs who are leaders in the beverage, entertainment, lifestyle and business services industries.
