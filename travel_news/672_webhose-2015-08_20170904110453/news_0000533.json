Communities along the 220 mile route will also benefit from additional journey opportunities at a number of other stations in the North West and the Midlands.\nIan Yeowart, Managing Director of Alliance said “We are naturally delighted that the ORR has approved our application to deliver a new direct rail service linking Blackpool and London The introduction of these new services will further grow the market for rail travel. As well as bringing new direct services to a number of locations, notably Blackpool, it will give passengers further choice. Experience on the East Coast Main Line (ECML) with Grand Central has shown how this stimulates the market and helps put pressure on prices, a fact noted by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in its recent rail review”.\nThe key features of the new service are:\nSix return trains a day between London and Blackpool – starting in 2018 Investment in a fleet of new tilting trains 120 new jobs created for this operation Significant wider economic benefits across the towns and cities served, particularly Blackpool which has recently received Enterprise Zone status.\nSource: Arriva", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:57:43.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
