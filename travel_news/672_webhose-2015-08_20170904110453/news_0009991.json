They would then put the safes in their suitcases and leave the hotel. \nThe thefts happened in a number of high-end hotels in Paris and on the Riviera before the twosome were apprehended at a hotel in central France last week. They were arrested after being identified through surveillance videos. \nAccording to a report by France’s RTL radio, police recovered jewellery, luxury clothing and varied Arab currency worth Dhs 328, 534 amongst the suspects’ possessions. The thieves also had about 20 hotel key cards, the report added. \nEurope is a popular destination among Gulf Arab tourists during summer months. Arab visitors also account for a sizeable chunk of spending within these countries. \nHowever their flashy behaviour has often attracted criticism from local residents and at times even prompted robberies. \nRecently the UAE issued a warning to all its citizens travelling abroad to avoid flaunting expensive clothing or accessories to ensure their safety in a foreign country. The ministry urged citizens to follow travel guidelines and procedures of the countries that they visit. \nThe warning follows an incident in the UK last year where three Emirati sisters were attacked and robbed in a luxury London hotel. The attacker bludgeoned the sisters with a hammer, leaving them seriously injured, and fled with a suitcase filled with iPads, gold jewellery and mobile phones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T23:08:13.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
