Their peer-reviewed report, Advanced Low-Floor Vehicle (ALFV) Specification Research , evaluated market comparisons, operational cost efficiencies, and prototype tests. Results showed a savings on operational costs, but several design adjustments are necessary for a final version. Principal investigator was Suresh Iyer, PhD, working with Partha Mishra and David Klinikowski . The free report is available for download at http://transweb.sjsu.edu/project/1151.html\n\"This study comes in light of what is required by federal mandate, what is available now, and what may be needed in the future,\" said Dr. Iyer. \"It is also intended to extend the way manufacturing and procurement can meet the transit industry's increasing requirements to serve the public. This is especially true in rural areas with challenging road surfaces or in small urban areas that may have insufficient transit funds.\"\nThe research team tested a prototype purpose-built, low-floor, diesel-powered, 25-seat, 26-foot (8-meter) bus. Ride Solution, Inc., of Putnam County, Florida , developed the bus for the Federal Transit Administration's Advanced Low-Floor Vehicle Specifications Research project.\nIt is well designed for flex-route operation.\nUnique features include a low floor with no steps (therefore, no need for a wheelchair lift) and the ability to carry 25 passengers, or five wheelchairs, or six gurneys, or a combination of these. This feature is especially valuable for disaster evacuations or for routes serving nursing homes and veterans' hospitals. The shortest rear overhang in its category allows operation on rural, unpaved roads.\nThe manufacturer predicts that the welded steel structure will improve the shell life to 20 years or more. Locating the engine/transmission in a cradle aids in low replacement time for the power unit. Internet connectivity is available for passengers and to help with maintenance. Good ground clearance is also designed into the bus, as well as good traction and stability, a longer service life, and a low lifetime cost.\nIn fact, if the ALFV serves out its predicted 20-year life, it potentially can deliver operational savings that offset the purchase price.\nThe report includes 34 tables and 20 figures, such as specifications; suspension travel data; turning radius data form; fields of view; ADA compliant checklists; time data for wheelchair securement; scheduled maintenance; savings vs. purchase price; and more.

The Consortium was organized in January 2012 after winning a competition sponsored by the US Department of Transportation to create consortia tasked with \"Delivering Solutions that Improve Public Transportation.\" Member universities include Bowling Green State University , Grand Valley State University , Howard University , Penn State University , Rutgers University , San Jose State University , University of Detroit Mercy , University of Nevada Las Vegas , and University of Toledo . Visit transweb.sjsu.edu/mntrc\nABOUT THE MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE (MTI)\n(The Lead Institute for the MNTRC)\nThe Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI) conducts research, education, and information transfer programs regarding surface transportation policy and management issues, especially related to transit. Congress established MTI in 1991 as part of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. MTI won national re-designation competitions in 2002, 2006 and 2012. The Institute is funded through the US Department of Transportation, the US Department of Homeland Security, the California Department of Transportation, and public and private grants. The internationally respected members of the MTI Board of Trustees represent all major surface transportation modes. MTI, the lead institute for the nine-university Mineta National Transit Research Consortium, is affiliated with San Jose (CA) State University's College of Business.
