The Telegraph has teamed up with The Student Room , to deal with the questions that are most troubling students in the build up to the big day. Members of The Student Room suggested questions and then voted for the ones they wanted to see answered, with a selection of the most voted for being put to the experts. Providing answers are Lynsey Hopkins, head of admissions at the University of Sheffield , and Hannah Morrish, education community manager (and resident Clearing expert) at The Student Room.

What does it mean if a university you applied for as your firm choice is in Clearing and you haven’t heard back yet? Is it a bad sign? Lynsey says: “It's not a bad sign at all. Universities no longer have rigid limits on the number of students they can take, and with fewer school-leavers in the population than there were several years ago, most universities are in the position of having room for more students in lots of areas. “Some universities and courses prefer to take their own firm candidates who've just missed their grades above new Clearing candidates, whereas others are more rigid on their grade requirements and will seek Clearing applicants with the right grades above firm candidates who drop grades. \"So a lot depends on how willing your specific course's admissions tutor is to be flexible on grades. “If your firm choice is in Clearing, results have been released but you haven't got a decision yet on whether you've been accepted, it could be that the university is missing a piece of information about you - you should phone to check what the delay in your decision is about.\" 2. What do I do on Results Day? Hannah says: \"Try and get as much sleep as possible the night before, don’t bother trying to logon to Track until after 8am and make sure you eat something! \"Pack your bag the night before and include a pen, notepad, calculator (in case your modules aren’t adding up), a screenshot on your phone or a print out of your exact uni offers, contact details, a bottle of water and some tissues (just in case.) \"If you think you’re going to be using Clearing or Adjustment, have the details of the courses you are interested in with you at all times. \"If you’ve made your offer, you can crack on with celebrating. Track will update and you can await your AS12 confirmation with information about what to do next. If you’ve missed your offer, check Track immediately. \"If it says unconditional firm then you’re in and you can relax. If it says that you’ve been unsuccessful but you’ve met the conditions of your insurance choice then this will change to unconditional. \"If you haven’t met your insurance offer, then you’ll be assigned a Clearing number, and if you have but you don’t want to go there anymore, you’ll need to contact them to ask to be released.\" 3. Can I use Clearing if I already have a conditional offer? Lynsey says: \"Not officially. Universities will only accept Clearing applications from students with completed qualifications who are not holding places elsewhere. \"That said, there's nothing to stop you ringing universities and seeing if they'd be interested in you, but in order to use Clearing you'd have to get released from any commitments you have to any other universities. \"This is a risk because once you've given up your place, a university may not be able to take you back if you change your mind. \"Also, a university isn't obliged to release you as in effect your choice of them as firm is a commitment on your part. You will have to ask them to release you into Clearing and explain your reasons. \"Think long and hard before giving up a confirmed place, and make sure you're very clear what universities are offering to you before taking any drastic action. \"A lot of Clearing negotiation is done on the phone, so make sure you're hearing what the person you're speaking to is actually saying and not just what you want to hear.\" Students should make sure they go into Clearing prepared (Photo: Alamy) 4. How does Adjustment work and what do I do if I’m abroad on holiday during my Results Day? Adjustment is for students who exceed their offer, and you become eligible as soon as your Track changes to unconditional firm. Lynsey says: \"Securing a place in Adjustment is similar to securing a place in Clearing: you check Ucas and universities' websites to see if there are vacancies, then contact the university to discuss a place. Even if you're away, you need to be ready to phone. \"For Clearing, once you've got a verbal offer you enter your Clearing choice on Track (this facility opens at 5pm on Results Day) but for Adjustment it's the university which goes into the Ucas system and picks you up. \"This immediately gets rid of your previous firm place, so it's highly unlikely that a university will do this until they have spoken to you and made sure that you know what you're doing and are certain you want to change.\" Hannah says: \"If you’re on holiday during Results Day, it’s a good idea to ask a friend or family member in advance to collect your results for you, make sure you inform the college of your plan. Don’t forget to take your Track login details with you and make sure someone at home also has access to Track so they can check for you if needed. \"Bear in mind that if you are looking to adjust, it’s likely you’ll be making a lot of phone calls to universities so being abroad at the time is likely to make this more difficult and expensive. If you want to adjust you will have five days to do so from Results Day. \"If you’re on holiday during this period and haven’t done your research but are desperate to adjust it’s probably worth asking your firm to release you and make a fresh application for 2016 with your exam results confirmed.\" 5. Will a university still accept me if I rejected them but re-applied through Clearing? Lynsey says: \"Well they're not obliged to, but if they have places left and you meet their requirements and call them up to secure a place, there's no reason why they shouldn't. \"You shouldn't worry too much about the decisions you made in the main cycle. \"You certainly shouldn't worry that having turned down a university before will prejudice them against you - they just want to get good students who are enthusiastic about their courses and capable of thriving on them. \"Admissions people know that going to university is a massive decision and understand that people change their minds and develop their ideas. \"If the university has places and you have the right grades, give them a call and don't be embarrassed about the fact that you turned them down before.\" 6. Do universities ask for lower grade marks in Clearing compared to their original offers? Lynsey says: \"Sometimes, but not always. Some courses and universities are looking to recruit large numbers in Clearing and may drop a grade or two to widen the pool of available applicants, whereas others may just know they have room for a few more students and want them to have the same grades as the original applicants. \"There are no hard-and-fast rules: applicants should simply take care, look carefully at the Clearing requirements on the Ucas website [on the Telegraph's Clearing search tool ] and the universities' own websites to check.\" 7. Can you apply for deferred places through Clearing? Lynsey says: \"In a word, no. Clearing is a way of matching up students and available places quickly at the end of the cycle prior to the academic year starting a month or so later.\" Hannah says: \"If I was you, I’d wait until the 2016 applications open in September and apply then. You’ll have your results, so you’ll be able to apply with confidence to universities who are looking for students with grades like yours. This option is practically stress free and with your grades already confirmed there is no reason why universities will not make you an unconditional offer.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:29:03.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
