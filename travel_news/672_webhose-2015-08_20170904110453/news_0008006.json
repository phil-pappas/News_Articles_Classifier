Inhabited predominantly by migrants from post-colonial countries, the area is a mini-Africa, a relic of colonialism, the French heart of darkness. Walking through Goutte d’Or, one section of the 18th, is like travelling across the entire African continent. First you pass Arabic apothecaries selling shisha pipes and tagines. There are Algerian butchers and Tunisian pastry shops. Women have their hair braided in Nigerian salons, or peer through shop windows at extravagant gold jewellery. However, travellers tend to admire anything but the population of the 18th. Guidebooks encourage tourists to trudge up the steps to Montmartre, to pay high tariffs to watch shows at the Moulin Rouge. They sip absinthe, and snigger at the sex shops of the Pigalle. While the sites of the 18th are praised, the people who live in the area are either censored from accounts or perceived as “dangerous”. The Sacré Cœur basilica, Montmartre's best-known attraction Photo: AP/FOTOLIA One evening, I was invited for couscous at Les Trois Frères, a bar near the African market that fills the daytime streets with a medley of shouts, fruity smells and rich colours. My new acquaintance, Apoline, locked my arm tightly under hers as we exited the metro. “Do you think it’s dangerous for us to be in the 18th at night?” she whispered. • Paris for romantics • Paris attractions: eight of the city's best lesser-known places to visit The community I witnessed during my 10-month stay wasn’t “dangerous” but poor and excluded. Recently, an airy glass construction popped up among the dilapidated buildings and fast-food restaurants on Boulevard Barbès. Glancing inside I saw nearly all white customers, tucking into their gourmet burgers, sheltered from the bustle of the street. The same is the case for La Recyclerie. It is a restaurant haven for middle-class “bobos” who munch on organic, locally produced food, and try to avoid the attention of the people outside desperately trying to sell fake designer handbags.

Sean Hash, who I met one day in a café, could reel off the entire history of every pre-existing Muslim people: the Abbasids, the Seljukids, the Safavids… He could talk forever about Islamic civilisation and became my alternative tour guide, recounting to me the background of the quarter. Although many other tourists will only appreciate the famous sites of northern Paris, such as Montmartre, I am pleased to have had my eyes opened to life in the 18th, which emerged from an important and sensitive period in French history. • Paris's grumpiest visitors • Is graffiti ruining Paris?
