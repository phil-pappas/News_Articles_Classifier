This is an outstanding and unique place full of pelagic life, so we need to accelerate the incorporation of the islands into UNESCO as [a] natural heritage site in order to increase the protection of the islands against the prevailing illegal fishing corporations and big-game fishing. \nWith over 17, 000 photo submissions from around the globe, National Geographic's judges had a tough task in front of them. The winners of the 2015 National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest have been announced and their photographs are unbelievable. \nTaking out the first place is an underwater photograph of divers swimming near a humpback whale taken by Anuar Patjane Floriuk of Tehuacán, Puebla, Mexico. \nShot near Roca Partida, an island off the western coast of Mexico, the winning photo is titled \"Whale Whisperer.\" \n\"The photo wasn't planned,\" Floriuk said. \"I was taking photos near the head of the whale, and all of a sudden she began to swim toward the rest of the diving team. The divers gave the whale and her calf space, and I just clicked at the moment when the flow and composition seemed right.\" \nFloriuk has won an eight-day National Geographic Photo Expedition to Costa Rica and the Panama Canal for two for his stunning photograph. \nSECOND PLACE: GRAVEL WORKMEN \n[This] gravel-crush working place remains full of dust and sand.

The faster camel is the loser … so they must be running [at] the same speed level in the same track. The main purpose of Ardah is to show the beauty and strength of the Arabian camels and the riders' skills. Ardah [is] considered one of the most risky situations, since always the camels reactions are unpredictable [and] it may get wild and jump [toward the] audience.

The moon was bright enough to illuminate the sand dunes in the distance, but the skies were still dark enough to clearly see the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Deadveli means \"dead marsh.\" The camelthorn trees are believed to be about 900 years old but have not decomposed because the environment is so dry.

Wearing only a well-adjusted loincloth (langot), wrestlers (pelwhans) enter a pit made of clay, often mixed with salt, lemon, and ghee (clarified butter). At the end of a workout, wrestlers rest against the walls of the arena, covering their heads and bodies with earth to soak up any perspiration and avoid catching cold. This relaxation ceremony is completed with massages to soothe tired muscles and demonstrate mutual respect.

Skulking through the grass carefully, trying to stay 30 feet away to be safe, didn't provide me the photo I was hoping for. In the morning, however, I woke up to all three rhinos grazing in front of me. Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary, Uganda.
