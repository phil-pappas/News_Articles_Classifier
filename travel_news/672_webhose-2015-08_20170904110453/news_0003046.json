Photograph by: Cristina Jacob , Vancouver Sun \nMy October 2014 trip abroad had three distinct legs: Taipei , Hong Kong and Sanya . All these places are in the South China Sea . \nWhile chatting with friends about their travel experiences in places I have not been, the first question I ask is: Would you go there again? If the answer is yes, I add that place to my list of future travel destinations. \nTAIPEI \nWould I go there again? Yes. \nTransportation in the city: Wonderful using the subway system with a convenient multiple-day pass available to purchase at the underground stations. \nHighlights: Taipei Zoo (a great collection of apes and monkeys for a noisy jungle feel), the two-kilometre gondola ride (the cabin makes a right angle turn and on the top there are myriads of tea plantations and tea houses), the museums, especially the Museum of Modern Art (the permanent collection is not very large but consists of well-selected pieces and the temporary steel-horse exhibit was very interesting). \nHigh moment: Being dwarfed by the size of cultural buildings in the public square in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Mausoleum . \nLow moment: Walking on sidewalks crowded by mopeds and smelly metal containers burning paper. \nTravel guide used: The free city map available at the hotel, which listed on the back the main attractions in English. \nAccommodation: Obtained through the Internet at super-modern hotel Park for $100/night/room, located away from downtown but right on top of the subway system at the St. Ignatius Station. Great breakfast. Language: Locals speak Mandarin, I spoke English and used sign language. No problem communicating like that. \nNew skill learned: To make the sound of baboons in the jungle. I will be using it at future sports events and when chatting with my nine-month-old granddaughter. Weather: Mid 20s, great for walking. \nShopping: Great, if trinkets are your passion. \nNext trip there: I would like to travel south of Taipei and see more of the island of Taiwan. \nHONG KONG \nWould I go there again? Yes. \nTransportation in the city: Wonderful if using a smart card called Octopus. The deposit fee and unused fare is refundable from the place you bought the card. Card works on subway, buses and ferries. \nHighlights: Stanley Peninsula (beautiful beaches, displaying a mix of windsurfers and beatenup fishing boats), HK Museum of History (an amazing collection of artifacts, costumes and beautifully narrated history), Kowloon Park (lush gardens, ponds, miniature turtles and a vibrant sports complex). \nHigh moment: Eating a whole roasted duck for $15. \nLow moment: Not being able to take a crisp picture of the beautiful architectural landscape of the city because of the heavy air pollution. \nTravel guide used: Hong Kong city guide by Insight Guides. \nAccommodation: Obtained through the Internet at super-modern hotel Ovolo for about $100/night/room, located away from downtown on the south end of the island. The hotel had a free shuttle bus several times a day to and from HK Station, where everything happens, including arrival by train from HK airport. Ovolo hotel deserves more than one paragraph. The reception area, which resembles a coffee shop, served breakfast in the morning and had free beer, soft drinks, coffee, tea, snacks and fruit all day and night. At 6 p.m. every day, they also had free happy hour, including hot and cold appetizers. The room was small, but who needs to be in it when there is free food and drinks nearby. \nLanguage: Locals speak Cantonese and English, so we had a common language to communicate in. \nNew skill learned: Looking without buying. At my age, I am trying to live by the motto “if you cannot it eat, don’t buy it.” It does not always work, but HK prices in the high-end stores made it easier. Weather: Mid 20s, great for walking. \nShopping: Fantastic if you are on a $50,000/month pension. \nNext trip there: Five me free airfare and it is done. \nSANYA \nWhere is that? It is a city surrounded by a multitude of resorts on the only true tropical island of China, Haina n, which is about 1 ½ hours by plane from Hong Kong. Latitude is similar to Hawaii. \nWould I go there again? Yes. \nTransportation: By taxi or privately arranged rides with the locals. \nHighlights: The beach at Yalong Bay (kilometres of fine sand, plenty of shells and colourful rocks and gentle non-treacherous surf), the nearby tropical forest national park (have been there twice both times in torrential rain, but I guess that was part of the experience), Li and Miao (native inhabitants) villages (unique display of native art and traditions). \nHigh moment: Hiking in the tropical forest. \nLow moment: The trip to downtown Sanya. \nTravel guide used: Internet. \nAccommodation: Five-star Marriott hotel on the beach in Yalong Bay at about $200/night/room. The hotel had expansive and expensive grounds with many amenities. Language: I only remember what I was speaking, but things got done. Lots of signs in Russian that I could read due to my knowledge of the Cyrillic alphabet. Sanya is a resort destination for the rich from China and Russia. \nNew skill learned: When doing yoga at 64 years of age, stay with the moves you already know. Trying new things ruined my mobility: I screwed up my right knee by staying in a new position for too long. \nNew motto: Pain, no gain. \nWeather: High 20s. Great beach weather. Water temperature 29 C. Shopping: Great for beachwear and linen. \nNext trip there: Whenever I will be in that part of the world, I will revisit the beautiful Yalong Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:41:30.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
