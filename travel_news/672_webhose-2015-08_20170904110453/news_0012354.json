[caption id=\"attachment_725\" align=\"\" width=\"1387\"] The iPhone 6 Lens incorporates five individual lens elements, resulting in the familiar 'bulge'. (Image Credit: Apple)[/caption] A person “within Apple’s supply chain” told Business Insider Malaysia that a new five-element lens is being produced, designed to work with a 12 megapixel sensor upgraded from the 8 megapixel sensor found in current iPhone 6 handsets. The unnamed person went on to reveal that a more complex six-element lens has also been ordered for a future undisclosed iPhone. Why add a lens element? Each element in a lens enables further refinement of the image, including the correction of unwanted distortions which can result in the bending of straight lines, as well as the removal of any coloured fringes which can often appear at the edges of an uncorrected photo. A six-element lens isn’t necessarily better than a five-element one. The number of elements required to achieve adequate correction will depend on the angle of view of the lens and the physical size of the imaging sensor. If the physical size of the sensor remains constant, then when the number of megapixels is increased, the lens will have to perform better to deliver a sharp enough image to the smaller pixels. This may require additional elements to correct smaller imperfections which may not have been picked up by a lower-resolution sensor. Many competing phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the OnePlus 2 already come with six-element designs.

This statement is false. Each lens element actually reduces the amount of light reaching the sensor by a tiny amount. Simply adding more elements to an existing lens design will therefore negatively impact the amount of light captured. To capture more light, a lens needs to have a wider aperture - i.e. a bigger hole for the light to pass through on its way to the sensor. However, high-quality wide-aperture lenses are more difficult to make and therefore require more optical corrections which can, in turn, require additional lens elements. The positive impact of the wider aperture vastly outweighs the small negative impact of the additional lens element. With this in mind, I could speculate that this additional sixth lens element might form part of a wider-aperture lens on a future iPhone as compared to the iPhone 6. The current iPhone 6 rear lens offers an aperture of f/2.2, but newer phones such as the previously mentioned OnePlus 2, Samsung Galaxy S6 and also LG G4 all have lenses which let in much more light than an iPhone 6- the G4 in particular offering an incredibly bright f/1.8 lens making it around 80 percent brighter. Higher resolution sensors and wider-aperture lenses give these competing phones a massive head start over the iPhone 6 when it comes to image quality- especially in low light. But, Apple does a great job of narrowing that gap through its excellent image processing algorithms. Perhaps soon with the addition of a 12-megapixel sensor and an improved wide-aperture lens the iPhone will retake the lead. The truth will come out in only a few weeks .
