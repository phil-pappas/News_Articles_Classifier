The connection with nature and music manifests itself. Tanglewood is not a destination. It's an experience.\" \nOn the heels of the Transcendental movement of the early 1800s, the Berkshires evolved into a resort for the rich and culturally astute, giving birth to some of America's great philosophers, writers and artists. \n\"Artists and writers wrote and painted gloriously about the beauty of the Berkshires,\" Sexton says. \nOne such celebrated local artist was Norman Rockwell. \nThe Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge features the world's largest collection of the illustrator's original works. Exhibits include paintings, drawings, studies, photographs and artifacts that reflect the evolution of Rockwell's life and career. \nThe work of Rockwell's sons, Jarvis and Peter, (now in their 80s), is also featured. A third son, Thomas, writes children's books. \nOn this visit to the museum, Jarvis was spotted working on his latest creation in the museum. \nAnother venue to embrace local art and music is MASS MoCA in North Adams. \nSince opening in 1999, MASS MoCA has quickly become one of the world's premier centres for contemporary art. \nOne popular exhibit, As Above, So Below, by artist Teresita Fernandez, features a suspended upside-down tree. \nThe gallery is unique because it can accommodate over-sized art that can't be displayed elsewhere, tour guide Jodi Joseph says. In fact, one gallery at Mass MoCA is larger than an American football field. \nWhile in the Berkshires, a visit to author Edith Wharton's home, The Mount, is a must. \nThe estate, built in 1902, showcases the life and works of the famed American writer of novels, short stories, poetry and non-fiction. Wharton won the Pulitizer Prize for her 1920 novel, Age of Innocence. \nThe Mount is the only monument to Wharton in America and one of just 5% of U.S. National Historic Landmarks dedicated to women. \nAfter a day of discovering, an afternoon lunch at the breathtaking Blantyre mansion takes you back to days gone by. \nBuilt in 1902, this historic building has been restored to its former glory by its latest owner. \nBlantyre -- meaning \"the warm retreat\" in Gaelic -- lives up to its name offering guests elegant accommodations and fine dining, as well as a chance to relax in its luxurious spa, The Potting Shed. \nNEED TO KNOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:26:29.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
