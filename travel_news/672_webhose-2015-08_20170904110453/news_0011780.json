At least not officially. \nEven though the list is clearly a work in progress, it’s nice to know that someone in the Alberta government is recording all the humps, bumps, coulees and canyons on the landscape. \nBecause you can have all the clinical legal descriptions that the sterile Torrens system throws at you, unless you give it a name the land lacks a soul. \nAnd if you are going to love it, admire it and protect it for whoever comes next you have to give it an identity first. \nDon’t get me wrong, there are also some real brutal names too. All those railroad towns named after railway company suits. Or the mountains in Kananaskis Country with names of bad World War I generals and Royal Navy dreadnaughts sunk in the Battle of Jutland. \nSeveral because they collided with each other in the night. \nTo tell the truth I don’t really know the difference between a butte and a mesa. Or a mount and a butte either. \nThat may explain why I couldn’t find Mount Butte on the government site, although Alberta Parks has the Mount Butte Natural Area on its protected places list. \nThe natural area and some adjacent quarter sections preserves the Crown land where the butte is situated. Although if there was any foresight and planning in the Alberta government, the entire Battle Lake basin would have been placed under a strict preservation order decades ago. \nUpwellings from the crucial Haynes Aquifer under the little, central Alberta lake are the Battle River’s sole source, which is our only significant southern river that doesn’t receive its critical initial flows from mountain snows and glaciers. \nBut because of high coliform bacteria levels (cows) and excessive amounts of agricultural fertilizer, the Battle is pretty much a dead river. Sad, really. \nMy walleye fishing buddies Emmerson, Peter and I launched Emmerson’s Explorer jet boat at the County of Wetaskiwin ramp, loaded my fox red Lab Penny and the gear and cruised to Battle Lake’s south shore where we began to hook up almost as soon as our baits hit the water. \nAt first we cast frozen shiner minnows threaded on a chartreuse jig, let the package sink to the bottom, then brought it back in a pop-and-pause retrieve. \nBut we soon figured out that a shiner dropped over the gunwale and suspended a foot or so above the bottom in vegetation-free water of about 20 feet was even better. \nWe’re all committed fly fishers and had brought 8-weights and Deceiver streamers along. But somehow we never got the impulse to string them. \nThe bite continued sporadically until we returned to the dock to eat our sandwiches and let the dog have a pee. \nWe then went looking for new water up lake. Mount Butte beckoned. \nWhen the bottom profile projected on the Lowrance’s screen began rising as we approached Battle Lake’s dominant hill, Emmerson killed the Yamaha and set the anchor. \nAt first there was no action and we feared we’d miscalculated. Then Peter got a bump, counted a couple of “steamboats”, and let rip. \nThe class of fish had definitely improved. These were market hog walleyes which fought deep and determined and got our spin-caster reel drags screaming when they made their runs. \nIt was a subtle bite but once we got the feel it turned into a cosmic evening under the soulful slopes of Walleye Butte.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T09:08:31.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
