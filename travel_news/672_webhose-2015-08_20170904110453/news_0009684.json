The menus mirror Goldfinch Tavern, with an emphasis on customising each meal to serve the purpose of the event, from a selection of dishes for appetisers and cocktails for a small reception to family-style or three-course meals for a casual dinner.\nAndrea Ikata, Goldfinch Tavern’s new Private Dining Manager, is responsible for booking and coordinating events in Whidbey and Vashon. One might also see her in the restaurant, assisting General Manager David Kim. David brings more than 25 years of experience in the restaurant industry, most recently from TableSafe and prior to that Canlis as service director.\n“Being in the restaurant means constantly interacting with all kinds of people and having the opportunity to make a connection with them via great meals and great experiences,” says Andrea Ikata. “I am thrilled to begin something that will be characteristic of what makes dining at Goldfinch Tavern truly unique.”\nGoldfinch Tavern also welcomes Thomas Rotherham as Sommelier. Thomas and Chef Joe Ritchie can elevate private events with their wine and culinary expertise to offer a memorable experience.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:32:47.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
