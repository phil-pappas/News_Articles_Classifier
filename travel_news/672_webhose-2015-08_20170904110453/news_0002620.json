In the category of “Best In-House Developed Application”, SFO was recognized for creating an Application-Based Commercial Transport System, which tracks app-enabled commercial vehicles operating at the airport boundaries.\n“We are always seeking innovation in our industry, and we saw a technological solution to airports’ unique data needs when integrating app-based commercial ground transportation,” said Chief Information Officer Ian Law. “We are proud to be recognized by the Center for Digital Government for our efforts, and we hope this system can benefit airports across the nation.”\nThe Application-Based Commercial Transport System developed by SFO allows airports with a GPS “geo-fence” to tabulate the commercial activity generated by app-based forms of ground transportation. This data can be used for fee calculation, roadway planning, and facility improvement efforts. In March 2015, SFO announced that the system will be licensed through the American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) for use at other airports around the United States.\nThe Center for Digital Government, a division of e.Republic, is a national research and advisory institute on information technology policies and best practices in state and local government. In their annual “Best of California” awards program, winners are selected by a panel of judges based on a number of criteria, including collaboration among agencies, innovative use of technology, economic benefits, and improving services and business processes. Awards will be presented on August 13, 2015, at the annual California Technology Forum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:00:25.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
