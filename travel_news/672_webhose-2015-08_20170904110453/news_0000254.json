With the presidential hopeful on the campaign trail for the foreseeable future, the collection may see its impact before the election. \n“The Trump Hotel Collection continues to be incredibly strong,” said Lisa Potts, senior vice president of sales and marketing, The Trump Hotel Collection , New York. \n“Our properties are performing at the highest levels and are outperforming our luxury competitive set,” she said. “Mr. Trump is leading in all national polls and we are seeing tremendous positive buzz surrounding the Trump brand.” \nOn the trail According to CBS News poll results released Aug. 4, Mr. Trump leads the crowded field of candidates with 24 percent of voters, and 79 percent of those polled say they believe he says what he believes instead of aiming to appease. Showing the divided feelings towards him, he is the number one candidate mentioned when surveyors asked who voters would most like not to see as the candidate. \nDuring his campaign announcement on June 16, Mr. Trump made inflammatory statements about Mexicans who immigrate to the United States. In his speech, he classified them as criminals, rapists, drug users and generally people with problems, ending his thought with “And some, I assume, are good people.” \nDonald J. Trump \nFollowing these comments, Spanish language television network Univision canceled its airing of the Miss Universe pageant, which is partly owned by Mr. Trump. Furthering the feud, the hotelier filed a lawsuit against Univision and banned its employees from a nearby golf resort in Miami, and the network advised its employees to avoid any of the Trump properties, according to CNBC . \nTelevision network NBC, which aired Mr. Trump’s program “The Apprentice” since 2004, and Macy’s which carried his branded merchandise, also cut ties with the entrepreneur in response to his speech. \nA Washington resident started a petition asking for chef José Andrés to walk away from his plans to open a restaurant in the upcoming Trump International Hotel opening in the remodeled Old Post Office Pavilion in the city ( see story ). After the petition received hundreds of signatures, the chef backed out of his contract with the hotel chain. \nWhen the chef’s dining flagship in the hotel was announced in January, Mr. Trump and his son Donald Trump, Jr. called the restaurateur a “local favorite” and said how his culinary skills would live up to the elevated aesthetic of the rest of the property. \nChef José Andrés \nMr. Andrés is quoted in the same statement saying, “I have long respected Donald Trump for his business acumen and am proud to partner with him to create a truly remarkable, fine dining restaurant in the city I have called home for many years, right in the heart of the historic Post Office.” \nThe following day, Geoffrey Zakarian, who owns multiple dining establishments in the New York area and is a frequent judge on television show “Chopped,” also backed out of his own restaurant deal with the Washington property. He had a lease to open an outpost of his restaurant The National within the hotel, and is losing money to preserve his image. \nGeoffrey Zakarian \nIn their reasons for leaving, both chefs say they employ many immigrants, with half of Mr. Andrés’ team being Hispanic, according to The New York Times . \nIn addition to its chefs, the property has also seen protests at the site by local officials and citizens who would like Trump to abandon and end construction on the project in the capital. These demonstrators were joined by a group of Mr. Trump’s supporters, showing the continued divisive effect the candidate is having. \n“When you have a person who is running for a political office, and has a reputation for being outspoken, it’s sure to cause added drama when it comes to his/her family and business,” said Damon Banks , freelance journalist and media consultant, New York. “In the case of Donald Trump, having a business as visible and public as the Trump brand is around the world, it can only mean the level of drama will be multiplied many times over. \n“The Trump brand has built a strong reputation for providing a unique level of services, and outside of minor setbacks along the way when emotions become involved with business, the Trump brand should not be negatively impacted long-term.” \nEven with the negative attention from the local community, the hotel chain says it is not having difficulties finding replacement chefs for the property. \n“We have had dozens of chefs and restaurant groups reach out to us and are reviewing our many exciting options for our signature restaurant,” Trump’s Ms. Potts said. “We will be making an announcement on this front very soon and Trump DC will have a world-class dining experience when the property opens in 2016. \n“We have always intended to self-operate the banquet facilities and room service at the property and continue to plan to do so,” she said. \n“Our efforts remain, and have always been, singularly focused on operating and managing the finest luxury hotels in the world.” \nMaking an appeal The Trump name has been at the center of controversies in the past. \nTrump Taj Mahal is among the number of casinos floundering in Atlantic City, NJ and the Trump family, owner of the property’s parent company, is suing to strip its name off the hotel’s lawsuit. \nThe hotel, part of the Trump Hotel Collection, was hit with a record-breaking $10 million penalty in January for anti-money laundering failures, further implementing the government’s actions to attempt to keep casino money clean. A luxury brand’s name adds to the consumer’s desire to own a product, or stay at the hotel, so the Trump family’s push to remove their name from the lawsuit is likely an attempt from the brand to maintain its reputation among guests ( see story ). \nEven before its namesake was a candidate, Trump Hotel Collection was capitalizing on the excitement surrounding the presidential election with a unique bidding initiative coinciding with the Trump International Hotel’s Washington debut. \nThe brand worked with Forward Market Media to let politically passionate consumers bid on rooms for the week of the presidential inauguration Jan. 20, 2017. To add another element of excitement to the campaign, winning bids are legitimate only if the right candidate is predicted ( see story ). \n“If Trump continues to pursue the presidency additional problems are likely,” said Marie Driscoll, chief executive officer and chief consultant of Driscoll Advisors, New York. “Everyone is not going to like his political stance and they will vote with their dollars. On the other hand, those who agree with Trump may consider his establishments and otherwise might not have. \n“Our memories are shrinking. Over the long term is shorter than a presidential term today,” she said. “Trump’s candidacy will attract and detract alike. A potential wash.” \nFinal Take Sarah Jones, staff reporter on Luxury Daily, New York Sarah Jones is staff reporter on Luxury Daily, New York.
