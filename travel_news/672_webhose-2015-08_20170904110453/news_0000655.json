The legend says the Gods granted them 24 children but on the provision that the 25th must be tossed into the volcano in sacrifice. The 25th child, Kesuma, was finally sacrificed in this way after initial refusal, and the tradition of throwing sacrifices into the caldera to appease the mountain Gods continues today. \nSupporters of LGBT community ride bicycles during the fourth gay pride parade in Hanoi, Vietnam. \nPeople play video games at the Gamescom 2015 gaming trade fair in Cologne, Germany.
