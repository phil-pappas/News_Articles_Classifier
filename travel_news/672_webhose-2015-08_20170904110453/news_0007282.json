Published on : Friday, August 21, 2015\nJune 1st marks the beginning of the 2015 Hurricane Season. Officially, it will last until November 30. So the entire summer travel season is potentially threatened and you might have to be ready with the alternative travel plans. There were as many as six hurricanes in last year along with a plethora of storms whose severity were no significantly less than those hurricanes. Again, you cannot just dabble with the travel plans even if your itinerary does not include the hurricane path; travel plans might still not go unaffected. Even if the planned destination is not within the hurricane path, storms can greatly affect travel and flight schedules at airports all across the country.\nThere are travel insurance offers which will cover most of the complications which you might face during the hurricane season. With an insured travel, you not only have a security to protect the investments but also have the peace of mind which is essential to mark a successful end to your trip. While an insurance plan solely for the disruption of a hurricane is not available, purchasing a plan with coverage that protects the inconveniences that hurricanes can cause can be helpful.\nSo here are some best tips that you might think to follow while travelling during the hurricane season.\nNo matter where you go, keep a policy purchased One of the major mistakes which most of the season travelers ought to do is assuming that there will be no issues in their travel path. However, it might not be the case as not only hurricanes but also the forecast for storms might even lead to the delay in plane scheduling or even cancellations.\nBuy policy before there is a name for the storm When the first payment towards the trip is made, make sure to buy the travel insurance policy. This is because, as the storm or hurricane gets a name, it would be too late to avail the benefits of the policy. It will not help you in any coverage that might be required to alter the already set travel itinerary.\nCheck for the Cancel for Any Reason benefit clause in the policy If there is any concern about the weather interfering with set travel plans, make sure you look for the ‘Cancel for Any Reason benefit’ clause in the travel policy to avail the best coverage needed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:26:56.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
