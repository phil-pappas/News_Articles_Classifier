The elite club of concierge managers boasts only 37 qualified members. \nMr. Peter Mansourian, General Manager of Grand Millennium Dubai said, “We were delighted to host the group for the second time at our hotel. This was an opportunity for our concierges to reacquaint with colleagues from various other hotels and strengthen the spirit of the group. The meeting also updated the concierges with growing demands of the guests and suggested ways to meet those expectations.” \nObtaining membership of the Les Clefs d’Or UAE also brings responsibilities in promoting tourism and enhancing the group’s commitment to increase its member’s network with other concierges. Les Clefs d’Or Concierges have their fingers on the pulses of their cities, able to advise guests on restaurants, night life, sporting and theater events, sightseeing tours, shopping, etc. They can direct guests to any location, to any product, at any time of day or night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T22:45:50.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
