Brosnan chose to pack the knife. \nBurke said that police wouldn't be called to Burlington International Airport for such an incident and they don't have a report on it. \nTMZ also reported that Brosnan was not arrested or cited and made it to his flight. \nThe Irish-American actor played secret agent 007 in movies including GoldenEye and Die Another Day . He also starred in The Thomas Crown Affair and Mrs. Doubtfire . \nHis publicist hasn't returned messages seeking comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:05:05.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
