The tunnel is an important complement to existing ferry service that connects the airport, located on Toronto Island, with the mainland.\n“This is a highly anticipated day for our passengers and team members,” said Robert Deluce, president and CEO of Porter Airlines. “The airport is now even more convenient for everyone who uses it. It’s already strong contribution to economic development and tourism will continue as it becomes increasingly successful.”\nThis improved infrastructure also supports the airport’s growing popularity with 2.4 million annual users. The tunnel is free to use and includes a combination of elevators, escalators and moving sidewalks to move people end-to-end within six minutes.\nSource:-Toronto City Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:41:11.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
