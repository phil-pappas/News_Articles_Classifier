Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 07, 2015 Adv: \nAs Emirates, Dubai’s award-winning national airline, takes delivery of yet more Airbus A380 aircraft – already being the largest operator in the world for this aircraft type – so will more destinations be able to see this giant bird come their way. \nOnly yesterday, the airline confirmed their intent to up the last of their 8 daily London flights from the B777 to the A380 come January 2016, the flight in question being one of 3 daily services to London Gatwick. \nEmirates presently operates 5 daily services on the A380 to London Heathrow and 2 of their 3 Gatwick services, too, offering a massive seat capacity for passengers from in particular Africa, the Gulf, and Asia to the UK’s capital city. \nWith British Airways’ pulling out of Uganda in October, Emirates, along with the other Gulf airlines, will provide options to reach London though the European legacy carriers flying out of Entebbe and will no doubt put up a fight to capitalize on shorter flying times and a wider range of connections from their hubs in Brussels and Amsterdam to London and other UK cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:08:22.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
