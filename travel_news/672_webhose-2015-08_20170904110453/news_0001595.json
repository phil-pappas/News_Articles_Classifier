The Sun Devils will practice at Camp T, about 17 miles east of Payson off State Route 260, from Aug.11-15 in preparation for their Sept. 5 season opener against Texas A&M.\nFormer ASU star Danny White will address fans and sign autographs to kick off the pep rally. The Sun Devil Spirit Squad cheerleaders will perform, and mascot Sparky is expected to arrive via a medical helicopter. He might also want to depart by air evac after taking part in several challenges, including a push-up contest, with fans.\nDavis said there will be food vendors and other attractions, such as face painting. The highlight, though, might be the NFL-style football skills course.\nFans can test their abilities in sprinting, throwing and kicking, or take part in strength challenges. One challenge pits two combatants connected by a rope who must battle the pull one another out of a ring.\nRELATED: Arizona hike: Round Valley Trail, Payson\nTimes and other results will be posted on a leader board so fans can see how they stack up.
