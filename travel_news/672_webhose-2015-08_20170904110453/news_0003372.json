IHG was forced to deny that it was looking to agree a deal with Starwood – which runs the Westin and Sheraton brands – after reports emerged that the two had held early-stage talks. Such a tie-up would have resulted in the world’s biggest hotel operator. \nThe newspaper cited senior city sources who said IHG and Starwood had discussed a deal earlier this year, but “talks never got off the ground” owing to regulatory hurdles. \nStarwood, which has a market value of around £8 billion, is now understood to be running a formal auction and is reportedly a target for the £7 billion French hotels giant Accor and the US-based Wyndham Worldwide. \nIHG is now said to be eyeing other targets, with plans to bring more global brands into its group. The British company is considering a bid for the Canadian operator Fairmont, which manages the Raffles hotel in Singapore. Deutsche Bank is advising the company, which is majority owned by the government of Qatar. \nMeanwhile, Deutsche is also working with Movenpick, which is controlled by the billionaire von Finck family of Germany and operates 100 hotels. \nInsiders said IHG had “not yet decided” whether to make an approach for either business. IHG is also likely to face strong competition from Asian sovereign wealth funds. \nIHG declined to comment, while Fairmont and Movenpick did not respond to request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:46:55.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
