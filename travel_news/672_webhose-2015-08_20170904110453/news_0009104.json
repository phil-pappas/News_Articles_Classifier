The alleged subway rage occurred aboard a Manhattan-bound F train from Queens last Friday. Police say the 45-year-old victim asked a woman to move her bag so she could sit down. When the woman ignored her, the victim attempted to sit down anyway. That's when police say the seated women flew into a rage. They say she scratched the other rider, pulled her hair, and bit her forearm, causing bleeding. The suspect fled when the train stopped at the 21st Street and Queensbridge station in Long Island City. The victim was taken to a hospital and is said to be in stable condition, while the attacker remains at large, the New York Daily News reports. The NYPD has released a picture of the suspect, shown here via CBS New York . (If the victim was late to work that day, maybe the NYC transportation authority will give her a late note .) The NYPD has released this picture of the suspect.
