I’m glad he rushed us, because this is an adventure you don’t want to miss! Kayaking with Beluga Whales \nWe arrived late and had a short window before we had to fly back to Winnipeg, so our group, quickly adjusted our foot pegs, frantically pulled the skirt over our cockpits and instantly paddled out to the bay to see what if we could catch a glimpse of the belugas swimming in the bay. A beluga whale says hello! \nYou see, flights in Northern Canada are unpredictable. We had just flown in from Nanuk Lodge where we spent the last few days walking with polar bears. (more on that next week) With weather delays messing up our schedule, we arrived back in Churchill late in the afternoon. We had a kayaking excursion booked to see the beluga whales that migrate by the thousands through the area at this time of year. But time was quickly running out. Tress was patient and easy going. (as he said, his name is weird, just like he is) but you could tell he wanted to get us on the water to have as much time as possible with these magical creatures. A beluga swims between us to say hello \nRead: Whitewater Kayaking, the Ultimate Ontario Adventure \nWe suited up as quickly as possible wondering how cold we’d be in the boats. Should we wear layers? Is the water cold? We were pretty far north, perhaps, we’d get a chill sitting in the cool Arctic waters. It turned out to be a stellar day and we were toasty warm in our kayaks. My hands were even comfortable when I dipped my GoPro into the bay for a closer look at the belugas, and the water was calm and smooth as glass. Balmy weather, mixed with sunshine and zero mosquitoes made for the perfect afternoon for a kayak adventure. A beluga scratches his nose on Dave’s boat \nThere is something about wildlife encounters that makes people happy. You cannot paddle through pods of belugas without having a huge grin on their faces. You could hear other paddlers laughing and gasping with delight when a beluga whale surfaced right beside their kayak and we followed suit whenever they were near us too. We have played with sea lions , snorkelled with dolphins and swam with whale sharks , and each time, the feeling is the same. The word that often comes to mind is glee. Watching beluga whales play in the water, bump our boats to scratch their noses and bite at our cameras to say hello was something we’ll never forget. Another friendly hello \nNote: This excursion is perfect for inexperienced kayakers as you don’t go far from the shore and there is a zodiac watching your every move should anything happen. \nSee more kayaking tours with ThePlanetD at", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:14:20.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
