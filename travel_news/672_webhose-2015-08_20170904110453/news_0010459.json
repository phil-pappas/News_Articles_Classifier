The number of creative lifestyle and design hotels is increasing. The promising creations include the new brands CitizenM, Moxy, Ruby, W Hotels, Mama Shelter and some more. TOPHOTELPROJECTS, worldwide leading provider for global b2b hotel data, has listed some.\nW Hotels (Starwood Hotels) – 38 new building projects among others in the USA, UAE, China and India\nMoxy Hotels – 19 new building projects among others in Germany, USA and Norway\nYotel – 7 new building projects in the USA, UAE and Singapore\nSoho House – 5 new building projects in the UK, the Netherlands and India\nCitizenM Hotels – 4 new building projects in France, UK and China\nRuby Hotels – 1 new building projects in Vienna/Austria\nAce Hotels – 1 new building projects in New Orleans/USA\nMama Shelter – 1 new building projects in Lille/France\nCasual style is no longer a unique selling point for new hotel types. Instead a design, which will merge living and working, is in demand. Thus, the new lifestyle hotels are characterized by generous lobbies, where you can lie on couches and sofas while working via the ultra-fast Wifi internet, ordering drinks and snacks at the kiosk. Due to smartphone automation, previous typical hotel operations as annoying as queuing at the reception desk for check-in or check-out are things of the past. Another technical benefit of the “Hotels 3.0″ is the Smart TV screens in the rooms, which will offer personal video libraries via the i.e. Netflix app access.\nE-mobility is also a feature of the new hotel types: Electric cars provided by cooperation partners can be recharged outside of the hotel. Guests can simply book these cars via smartphone app. A new hotel concept in Germany, which will be presented this autumn, will provide an E-Smart directly upon arrival at the airport or train station. The guest can drive immediately to a business meeting or directly to the hotels. Hotels will be (new) centres of mobility, also with e-bikes and transport bicycles to borrow.\nTOPHOTELPROJECTS collects and evaluates data about all hotel construction projects and hotel chains worldwide in an online database and provides its subscribers with a comprehensive overview of all major hotel projects, refurbishments and extensions worldwide. The online database currently holds over 5,000 live and confirmed projects and more than 1,800 hotel brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T06:21:03.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
