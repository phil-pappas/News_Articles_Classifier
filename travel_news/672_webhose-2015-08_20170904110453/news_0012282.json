Sitting alongside the fully themed, interactive 150-room Hotel and leading directly onto the Park, the LEGO® Suite offers contemporary meeting and team building spaces plus conferencing options for up to 320 delegates in a unique, inspiring environment. With access to the on-site entertainments team plus an incredible cast of LEGOLAND characters, properties and team building challenges each occasion can be tailored in memorable ways.

LEGOLAND Day Build: Kick off a meeting with the new ‘LEGO Build A Badge’. A perfect 15-minute ice-breaker, delegates can choose from a box full of LEGO® bricks and pieces to design and build the perfect name badge to express and introduce themselves. Or better still, task each participant with building someone else’s name badge! Names get remembered and the badge creates an excellent keepsake to the event. Then develop team work, strategy, creativity and time keeping skills with the 60-minute LEGO Architect. With every member of the team assigned a specific role and task, the build challenge is to construct the tallest possible DUPLO structure, without it collapsing …. Alternatively, to focus more on communication skills, delegation, memory and attention to detail, opt for the LEGO Creator – where the team is set a common build goal with no written instructions against the clock. The LEGO Suite Daily Delegate Rate is from £60, and meetings for 25 delegates or more in November and December will benefit from a complimentary ‘Build a Badge’ team build as their ice-breaker. LEGOLAND Day and Night Build: For more immersive corporate occasions, follow your day time meeting with an exclusive dive beneath the sea to spot the sharks on LEGOLAND’s Atlantis Submarine Voyage, followed by drinks and canapes in Park, then a three course dinner in the LEGO Suite or interactive Bricks Restaurant before an intriguing overnight stay like no other in a fully-themed Pirate, Adventure, Kingdom or new LEGO Friends bedroom. Rates for 24-hour events start from £190 and bookings for 80 + delegates can benefit from their complimentary ‘Build a Badge’ ice breaker and an exclusive, memorable experience on LEGOLAND’s Atlantis Submarine Voyage.
