Published on : Tuesday, August 25, 2015\nThe next winner of the ibtm world Technology and Innovation Watch Award is about to be found. With just two weeks left for submissions – entries close on 4 September – the industry’s annual global award is open to anyone who has an inspiring and innovative product that could contribute to the future of the meetings industry.\nA judging panel will shortlist 10 submissions to be recognised as the ‘Top 10 Innovations to drive the industry forward’. These 10 innovations will be offered the opportunity to feature in the dedicated Innovation Zone at ibtm world. The panel will also vote for one of these top ten to become the Technology and Innovation Watch winner.\nConsidered by previous winners to be a key platform for launch and awareness of their product, this year’s winner will not only benefit from a global pre- promotional campaign via ibtm world (www.ibtmworld.com), the leading global event for the meetings and events industry, but also a prominent presence in the Innovation Zone, and the opportunity to present their winning product at the show in Barcelona. www.ibtmworld.com/techwatch\nWinning the award in 2014, LiveGroup, made the most of the opportunity: “We’re absolutely delighted to have gained such clear recognition for the quality of our work. The award is a ringing endorsement of the extraordinary capabilities of the Live Group’s mobile app, not least the newly launched Locator Function, which we think is set to be a game changer for delegates, clients and venues hosting live events”\nShowcasing their products in the Innovation Zone gives companies access to some 15,500 meetings and events industry professionals including exhibitors, Hosted Buyers and visitors. Showslice who took part last year said: “The major change we made was to our income generation and we are now currently growing at a rate of 25% each month. We received a lot of support and insight from various organisations. Being part of the Innovation Zone got us noticed by Shell who gave us £3,000 and the Shell Livewire Sustainability Award in December 2014 considering us to be a smart city solution for events. This has helped us to define our offering further and ensure that we always provide our clients with a professional service that brings the industry together.”\nGraeme Barnett, Senior Exhibition Director commented: “Since its creation, the Innovation Zone has always been a great showcase of the creativity, passion and drive needed to create real change within the meetings and events industry. It is also an opportunity to secure real business with Hosted Buyers, trade visitors and even exhibitors, all wanting to see how this part of the industry can improve their own business. Many young companies have had the opportunity to be part of the discussions, to uncover potential and to connect with the innovative and the influential.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T11:12:50.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
