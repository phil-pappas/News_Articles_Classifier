While some customers understand why Air Koryo has such a low rating, others touch down feeling pleasantly surprised. \nThat's the thing about being 'the world's worst' - you only have to beat low expectations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:22:34.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
