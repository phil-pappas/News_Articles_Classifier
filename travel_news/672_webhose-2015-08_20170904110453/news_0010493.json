The film will make its Alabama debut at the 17th Annual Sidewalk Film Festival Saturday, Aug. 29, at 4:30 p.m. in the historic Carver Theatre. Q will also be broadcast on Alabama Public Television Sunday, Sept. 6, at 6 p.m. Alabama barbecue is the basis for a compelling story, and the film tells that story in multiple ways. It showcases the diversity among restaurant owners, pit masters and barbecue experts within the state, as well as the diversity of the barbecue itself – from white sauce in the north to red sauce in west Alabama.\n“If Alabama had an official smell, it would have to be hickory smoke,” said Lee Sentell, Director of the Alabama Tourism Department. “Memphis, Kansas City, the Carolinas and Texas each have their own defined style of barbecue. Alabama has become the center of the barbecue world because we adopted the best of all these different styles and also added a few unique ones of our own.”\nOther storylines extend beyond the people to the food itself, from the main attraction – be it pork butt or ribs, chicken, beef brisket or sausage – to sides and desserts, from collard greens to banana cream pies. Storylines in the film also address the variety of sauces from place to place and among regions. Each restaurant sets itself apart from the next with its own unique approach.\nInterviewed in the film:\n● Sam Nakos, Demetri’s BBQ, Homewood\n● Cliff Mortimer, Barbecue Stop, Clay\n● Earlie “Bam” Threatt, R & B Bar-B-Q, Lincoln\n● John Bishop Jr., The Original Dreamland Bar-B-Que, Tuscaloosa\n● Van Sykes, Bob Sykes Bar-B-Q, Bessemer\n● Dale Pettit, Top Hat Barbecue, Blount Springs\n● Chris Lilly, Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q, Decatur\n● Don McLemore, Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q, Decatur\n● Mike Holley, Chuck Wagon BBQ, Madison\n● Melvin Rogers, Melvin’s Place of BBQ, Huntsville\n● Tim Fife, Tim’s Walk Hard BBQ, Leesburg\n● Wade Reich, Butts To Go, Pell City\n● Rusty Tucker, Rusty’s Bar-B-Q, Leeds\n● Beth Tucker, Rusty’s Bar-B-Q, Leeds\n● Carolyn Jackson, McMillan Bar-B-Que, Mobile\n● T.J.
