You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Adi ALGhanem/Flickr \n…The London Eye! Some consider London to be the greatest city in the world and there is certainly something for everyone here. You can cruise the River Thames, visit Westminster Abbey, get a glimpse of royalty at Buckingham Palace, feel tiny next to Big Ben, stroll across the Tower Bridge, catch a show in the West End, or visit some of the many museums. One thing you should do at least once in your life is ride the London Eye. From 443 feet in the air, you’ll be treated to the most incredible views of the city. For a truly magical experience, you can try to time your ride to be at sunset when the sky is a rainbow of colors, but the views are equally dazzling during the day or at night when the city is all lit up. Once you’re done with your trip high above the city and have returned to ground level, treat yourself to some fish and chips and a pint at Kerbisher & Malt , one of the finest chip shops in all of London.
