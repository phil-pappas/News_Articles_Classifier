Yikes!\nThe “commons” continue to die.\nThe email addresses of 19 Arizona government employees are among those hacked from the marital cheating website AshleyMadison.com. Using your taxpayer-funded email to send a note to your spouse is one thing, but to cheat on him or her? So much for common sense.\nThe other possibility is someone borrowed the addresses; AshleyMadison doesn’t validate how people sign up. If that is what happened, it’s an affront to common decency.\nRobert Leger Editor: Robert Leger oversees the opinions page, including The Republic's editorials and columns, your letters to the editor, My Turns and syndicated columnists.
