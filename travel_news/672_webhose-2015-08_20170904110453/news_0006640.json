Stir fry the ingredients until the spices appear to stick to the base of the pan. At this point, add 2 chopped tomatoes and stir till the ingredients are cooked well. Now, throw in 2 pounds of cubed lamb or beef, as per your choice. Add 4 chopped garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons ground ginger and 6 curry leaves to the meat and gravy. After a while of simmering, add 2 chopped potatoes and a bit of water. Let the contents of the pan simmer until the meat is tender. \nVoila, you've now cooked the curry that goes into the bunny chow!
