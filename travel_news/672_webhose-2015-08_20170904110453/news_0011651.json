The warehouse is due to be completed by October 2017 .\n\"DENSO is committed to strengthening and expanding its product development and manufacturing capabilities across the region, and we're excited about the additional opportunities this expansion will bring to our company, our employees, the Maryville community and the state of Tennessee ,\" said Jack Helmboldt , president of DMTN.\nIn January 2013 , DENSO announced it would invest nearly $1 billion in North America over the next four years, which will result in more than 2,000 jobs across the region. The investment will allow DENSO to better support its North American customers, as well as expand new business areas and localize products, many of which will help automakers meet upcoming fuel requirements. More than $750 million will be invested in the United States alone, along with more than 1,200 jobs.\nIn recognition of the community's 25 years of support and DMTN's theme of \"healthy living\" for its 25 th anniversary, DMTN will present a $50,000 donation to Blount Memorial Hospital and a separate donation of $50,000 to East Tennessee Children's Hospital.\n\"We know our employees and their families depend on these wonderful medical facilities, and we hope that these gifts can help with the many special programs and services needed by the people of East Tennessee ,\" stated Helmboldt.\n\"We congratulate DENSO on this announcement, and we appreciate their continued commitment to Blount County and the great state of Tennessee ,\" said Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam .\n\"Last year when I walked through the DENSO plant, it was bursting at the seams,\" said Senator Lamar Alexander . \"These 500 new jobs are one more example of how the auto industry has spread into 80 of Tennessee's 95 counties to become the main contributor to raising our family incomes.
