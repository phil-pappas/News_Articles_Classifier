Edward Robertson reports \n﻿Facebook generates nearly four times as many interactions on social media for travel firms as Twitter. \nNew research revealed in BDRC Continental’s Social Media Impact “Freemium Report” shows that while 98% of the 1,007 consumers surveyed use Facebook generally, 59% said they used it for travel and leisure (T&L) interactions within the past six months. \nThis was way ahead of the 16% who use Twitter to interact with T&L businesses and proportionally far more than the 55% who use it generally. \nWhile a further 73% admitted in spring this year they use YouTube, even fewer - 11% - use it to interact with the business in question. \nLinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr are much further down the field with 5%, 4%, 4% and 2% using the respective sites for T&L interaction. \nAssociated director at BDRC Continental Jon Young said he believed Facebook was the most popular social media site because it offered greater opportunities for engagement than any of the others. \nHe added: “For T&L brands, not all social media platforms are equal. \n“Facebook is obviously a leading social media platform… you can share content on it that is educational, entertaining and lively and there’s more space to do it. Twitter is very fleeting engagement - it is about short and sharp updates. Facebook is a community… It is like the equivalent of a local pub - it is somewhere you go to spend time.” \nOf all the brands using social media with the T&L industry, car rental firms were the best at doing so, he said. \nYoung said the study had shown that they generate the highest levels of satisfaction, 85%, and highest brand usage conversion, 83%, as a result of using social media. \nMoreover, 26% said social media posts exercised “a lot of influence” on consumers and directly prompted them to use the brand, higher than any other T&L type of company. \nYoung said this was largely because car rental firms focused on more than just the basics in their social media, adding: “We were initially surprised with the success of car rental companies but when we looked at their Facebook pages we saw some really inspiring posts. \n“Rather than focus on the transaction, they talk about the romance of travel and the open road. \n“Car rental companies demonstrate how a fairly dry transaction can be made into so much more with interesting and inspiring social media content.” \nYoung added that visitor attractions were the next best at using social media, with 74% of respondents saying they were likely to use a brand following a visit, while 80% said the interaction had “at least some” influence on personal satisfaction with the brand. \nOTAs followed, with the same proportion claiming they would use a brand after social media interaction, although 74% said it had “at least some” influence. \nLastminute.com was the most effective in driving use at 31% and hotels.com came second on 25%. Booking.com ranked third at 20% while expedia.com drew 14%. \nOf the entire sample, 46% had had an interaction with a T&L firm within the past six months. Unsurprisingly, generation Y (18-34s) is still the biggest user of the media, with 66% having done so. This was more than the 50% of generation X (35-54s) who said as much - and considerably more than the 35% of baby boomers (55 and older). \nGeneration X is most likely to use social media to find useful information, with 47% saying they used it, while generation Y is most likely to be connectors, interacting with brands that are important to them, with a quarter stating that they use social media for this purpose. \nBaby boomers are the least likely to use social media to connect with a brand - with 6% saying they do so. Most use the media to learn about a brand, with 46% saying they do so.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:01:36.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
