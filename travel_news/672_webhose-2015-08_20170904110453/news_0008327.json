(Photo: National Park Service)\n302 CONNECT 4 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The history, and the people, of the Jacks Fork and Current rivers are a bit rugged, but that water is crystal clear.\nThe rivers, which make up the Ozarks National Scenic Riverways, meander across southeast Missouri for more than 200 miles.\n\"There are several large springs that pump 200 million gallons a day,\" says Dena Matteson, public information officer for the park. \"And interwoven in that is a really unique landscape and cultural history.\"\nMatteson says the land was settled by the Scotch and Irish in the 1800s. She described theirs as a hard-scrabble lifestyle. \"You can trace the roots of a lot of the locals to those original settlers,\" she says. \"It's a different area to live in. They're a really hardy people with a lot of cultural pride.\"\nThe land hasn't been developed much in the intervening 200 years. \"It's an isolated area for the most part,\" Matteson says. \"It's hard to get in and out of. The people settled in around these hills and hallows, digging out an existence in the area.\"\nBut a result of that isolation is the high quality of the water.\nMatteson says people are surprised at how clean the water is, especially those who have floated in other rivers. \"There are big springs, the most beautiful springs in the area,\" she says. \"You can stand next to them in the clean water. It's a beautiful, picturesque setting.\"\nShe says the limestone landforms and waterfalls also add to the beauty of the area. \"You won't believe it until you walk to the edge,\" she says.\nCanoeing is one of the most popular activities in the park, along with kayaking and rafting. Behind the shores there are caves, trails and the historic Alley Mill. The caves include Round Spring Caverns, which offers ranger-led tours in the summer.\nMatteson said it's an unusually large piece of public land.\n\"It's an unusual benefit,\" she said. \"Most people would never be able to head out into the landscape for miles and not be trespassing. It's a unique way to live.\"\nHerzog also reports for the Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader.\nTo learn about park sites from all 50 states, order USA TODAYâ€™s special edition, National Treasures at onlinestore.usatoday.com.

They built cabins and promoted the idea of a state park, which was established in 1925. Four decades later, it was made part of the national park system.\nWhen visiting : The park is open year-round and has multiple visitor centers. For more information, call the park headquarters at 573-323-4236.\nOf note : Visitors should keep an especially close eye on the weather, as traveling the rivers can be dangerous in certain conditions. Heavy rain can cause flooding in the area and can cause the rivers to run faster.\n302 CONNECT 4 TWEET 3 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1LmBnYb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LmBnYb&text=The%20Ozarks%3A%20Scenic%20rivers%27%20attraction%20is%20clear&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e676adb7763afbfc12abd555188cf443afc525b9/c=0-0-1640-2186&r=183&c=0-0-180-238/local/-/media/2015/07/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635729076639784773-NationalParksFINAL.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635723804637219515-XXX-NP-Ozark-National-Scenic-Riverways02.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LmBnYb&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LmBnYb", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9b2613171fe63999b66d30209ed30c82a3fc766/c=2-0-1598-1200&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635723804637219515-XXX-NP-Ozark-National-Scenic-Riverways02.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/07/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635729076639784773-NationalParksFINAL.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T08:22:29.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
