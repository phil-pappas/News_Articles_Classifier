Working in partnership with Manchester Airport, Qatar Airways invited guests to its stand at the popular event so they could learn more about the award-winning airline’s products and services out of Manchester and have a chance to win a pair of return flights to any of the more than 60 destinations on the Qatar Airways network in Africa and Asia. \nParticipants were able to enter the competition either by visiting the Qatar Airways stand and spinning a destination wheel, created by Journey 9, or by tweeting #digthedestination. One lucky winner secured a pair of return flights to their choice of a range of exotic locations, including Bangkok, Cape Town, Hong Kong, Maldives, Bali, Goa, Melbourne, Shanghai, Colombo and Singapore. The experiential activity is part of a prominent campaign highlighting the convenience, frequency and choice that Qatar Airways offers both leisure and business travellers with a double daily service from Manchester Airport to the state-of-the-art hub, Hamad International Airport. Qatar Airways UK and Ireland Country Manager, Richard Oliver, said: “Qatar Airways proudly supports the Manchester region by offering long-haul flights direct to Doha with convenient connections to more than 150 destinations worldwide. “Our double daily service opens up new destinations to Manchester residents and we were delighted to see such strong engagement with #digthedestination at Dig the City this weekend as we inspire the community to explore new destinations with Qatar Airways.” The Qatar Airways Manchester to Doha service commenced in 2003 and in February 2015 became a double daily service. Qatar Airways serves a total of three destinations in the UK including London Heathrow and Edinburgh.
