Schmidt has previously held positions at the J. Paul Getty Museum in California and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Between 1994 and 2001 he worked at the German-funded Art History Institute in Florence and he also curated a show at the Pitti Palace in Florence two years ago. \n\"I will certainly bring international experiences to the process, but I think it is also important, and I imagine that it might have played a role, that I am quite familiar with the Italian system,\" he said. \nFranceschini actively sought foreign candidates for the jobs, publishing advertisements in publications abroad to attract experts from around the world with the aim of making Italian museums more dynamic in both their services and fundraising. He also has pledged to give museum directors more autonomy. \n\"Modernizing our museums means better protecting our treasures, but also investing in the growth of the country,\" Franceschini told SkyTG 24, adding that museum visitors today expect multi-media exhibits, cafeterias on site and educational laboratories for children. \nFranceschini said the recruitment process was only part of cultural reforms he has enacted, citing also a move to make Italy's 400 state museums free on the first Sunday of the month. He said the policy had boosted visitor numbers to 40 million last year, up by 2.6 million from a year earlier. \nStill, Italy's museums are generally seen as being under-exploited: only five receive more than a million visitors a year, including the Uffizi and the Pantheon in Rome. \nWhile the recruitment choices were greeted with diplomacy, some in Italy criticized the process. Vittori Sgarbi, a former Milan culture official and well-known commentator, said Franceschini had demoralized his troops with the new recruitment system, calling it \"a dangerous political act.\" \n\"There are capable people among the 20 selected, but I don't believe that the new director of the Uffizi ... is better than the outgoing,\" Sgarbi was quoted by the news agency ANSA as saying. \nFor his part, outgoing Uffizi director Antonio Natali told ANSA that he didn't expect to retain the post after the changes were announced but that he was no longer bitter. \n\"I was bitter when I understood the script. But I continued to work as always, as if I would remain at the Uffizi until the year 3000,\" he said. \n  \nIn this 2009 photo, German historian Eike Schmidt poses for pictures in the galleries of the Minneapolis Institute of Art in Minneapolis. Italy's culture minister announced Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015 that Schmidt, a 47-year-old art historian, will run the famed Uffizi Gallery in Florence after the government opened up top museum jobs for the first time to an international competition.
