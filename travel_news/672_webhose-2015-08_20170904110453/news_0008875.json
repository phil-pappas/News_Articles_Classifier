Celebrating six decades of magic, the Disneyland Resort Diamond Celebration features three new nighttime spectaculars that immerse guests in the worlds of Disney s The Happiest Place on Earth is about to get bigger. One billion dollars bigger.\nOver the last year or so, Disneyland purchased three parcels of land near its current location in Anaheim, California. Then, last month, Disneyland officially promised to spend at least $1 billion on new attractions and a parking structure .\nWait a second... could this mean a whole new Disney park ?!\nThe answer is no. Disneyland won't add a third theme park to its Anaheim outpost anytime soon, the Orange County Register reports. Instead, the new land will be used for office spaces, parking and other infrastructure needs , a Disney rep told the L.A. Times.\nTheme park pros speculate that this would free up space in or around the Disneyland and California Adventure parks for new attractions involving \"Star Wars\" and Marvel comic book characters .\nAnd they're speculating for good reason: Disney acquired Marvel in 2009, and in 2012, it acquired Lucasfilm (aka the entire \"Star Wars\" franchise ). Since then, it's been no secret that Disney could add both Marvel and \"Star Wars\" elements to its parks. They've even experimented a bit already .\nKeep your mouse ears tuned, because something new IS going to happen soon: Disneyland promised to start construction on a park expansion by 2017 .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-670657-anaheim-city.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://marvel.com/news/movies/22076/captain_america_arrives_at_disneyland_park_in_anaheim?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disney-buys-anaheim-land-sparking-expansion-speculation-20150804-story.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://waltdisneystudios.com/corp/unit/246?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.slashfilm.com/disneyland-land-purchase/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://ktla.com/2015/08/04/disneys-purchase-of-land-in-anaheim-sparks-speculation-about-resort-expansion/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-654003-third-disneyland.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2012/10/30/disney-star-wars-lucasfilm/1669739/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-668511-city-anaheim.html/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618"], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:07:46.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
