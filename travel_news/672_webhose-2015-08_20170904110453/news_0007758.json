Still, he will cut back on his work with the Carter Center and will give the treatment regimen his “top priority.” His first radiation treatment was set for Thursday afternoon.\nCarter, appearing in a dark blazer, red tie and jeans and surrounded by friends and family, said at first he thought the cancer was confined to his liver and that the operation earlier this month had completely removed it, “so I was quite relieved.”\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid CenturyLink takes on Comcast in Seattle with rival Prism TV But that same afternoon, an MRI showed it was on his brain.\n“I just thought I had a few weeks left, but I was surprisingly at ease. I’ve had a wonderful life,” the 90-year-old Carter said.\nHe didn’t give any prognosis, but spoke about receiving treatments for at least several months and left open the possibility of traveling to Nepal in November.\nCarter announced Aug. 12 that liver surgery found cancer that has spread to other parts of his body. Doctors removed about 1/10 of his liver during the surgery, he said. Carter said it’s still not clear exactly where the cancer originated.\n“So far the only place they’ve known about cancer has been my liver and my brain,” he said.\nHis father, brother and two sisters died of pancreatic cancer. His mother also had the disease. Carter said no cancer has been found on his pancreas so far.\nCarter said President George W. Bush and Bush’s father called him Wednesday, and he has received well-wishes from President Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Secretary of State John Kerry.\nThat’s “the first time they’ve called me in a long time,” Carter said to laughter.\nCarter’s health has been closely watched this year. He cut short an election monitoring trip to Guyana in May. A spokeswoman said he did not feel well and Carter later said he had a bad cold.\nThe center announced Carter had a small mass removed from his liver Aug. 3. Nine days later, Carter said that surgery revealed the cancer.\nCarter was the nation’s 39th president, advancing as a virtual unknown on the national stage to defeat President Gerald Ford in 1976. But several foreign policy crises, in particular the Iran hostage crisis, crushed his bid for re-election and Ronald Reagan swept into the White House.\nThe native of tiny Plains, Georgia, rebuilt his career as a humanitarian guiding the center focused on global issues, including health care and democracy. Carter earned a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, helped defuse nuclear tensions in the Koreas and helped avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti.\nHe and his wife, Rosalynn, still make regular appearances at events in Atlanta and travel overseas. When the couple is in Plains, Carter frequently teaches a Sunday School class before services at Maranatha Baptist Church. He plans to teach this weekend as scheduled, according to the church.\n“No matter where we are in the world, we’re always looking forward to getting home to Plains,” Carter said.\n___\nAP Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report.\nKATHLEEN FOODY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:59:16.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
