A lot. At least, that’s what successive governments at the Centre seem to suggest. Henceforth, the ministry of agriculture will be called the ministry of agriculture & farmers’ welfare, PM Narendra Modi declared on Saturday in his Independence Day speech, adding the well-being of peasants was as important as the growth of agriculture.\nThe state of Indian agriculture has undergone a sea change since independence, and so has its most visible face in the national capital — the 68-year-old ministry of agriculture in Krishi Bhavan. However, the changes to the latter have mostly been in its names, as per the convenience of the ruling dispensation, political equations and, of course, the ease of governance.\nSo while the Modi government isn’t the first one to change the name of the ministry since its formal christening as the ministry of agriculture in August 1947 from the erstwhile department of agriculture, but his would be the first one since 1991 to do so.\nSome analysts, however, view the name change as an attempt by the government to be seen as pro-farmer rather than pro-rich, as the Opposition has tried to portray it since the beginning. They say such an image makeover is essential, especially when the government is trying to drum up support for its land acquisition Bill . Farmer leaders, meanwhile, expect more than just the name change to be re-assured of the NDA government’s intent on farmer welfare.\nSince 1947, the name of the ministry has been changed to the ministry of food & agriculture (1951), the ministry of food, agriculture, community development and co-operation (1966), the ministry of agriculture (1971), the ministry of agriculture and irrigation (1974), ministry of agriculture (1980), the ministry of agriculture and rural re-construction (January 1985) and the ministry of agriculture and rural development (September 1985).\nIn July 1991, the department of fertilisers was transferred from the ministry of agriculture and rural development to the newly-established ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, and the department of rural development was segregated to form another ministry. So, the parent ministry was again named as the ministry of agriculture having three departments: the department of agriculture & co-operation, the department of agricultural research and education and the department of animal husbandry and dairying. While the name of the ministry has remained the same since 1991, its composition, just like in earlier decades, was at times tweaked around to insert or part with certain departments.\n 16, 2015 12:00 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T03:39:44.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
