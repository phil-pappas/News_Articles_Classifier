Funded in part by VISIT PHILADELPHIA, PHLCVB, WMOF, and SEPTA, the videos provide visitors to Philadelphia and attendees of the WMOF events with insights, information and visuals for some unique and historically significant Catholic churches and shrines in order to enhance their Philadelphia experiences.\nProduced by HMP, a Philadelphia documentary film company founded and led by Sam Katz, and hosted by Diana von Glahn, creator and on-air hostess of The Faithful Traveler website, thevideos explore historical, religious and architectural information about five national Catholic shrines located in the region, as well as several of the region’s most beautiful and significant churches and destinations that have long played important roles in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.\n“By watching our short films that present such important Catholic landmarks, visitors will gain a better understanding of the extraordinary influence religious life has played in shaping the culture of our city,” says Sam Katz, executive producer. “These films provide a context and framework that visitors will value.”\nThe videos are viewable on the Go Philadelphia! App, created by WMOF to provide visitors with information about activities taking place from September 18 through 29. The app is available for Apple and Android devices.\nThe first of the 10 videos focuses on St. John the Evangelist Church, built in 1864 and located in Center City Philadelphia. St. John’s served as the Cathedral for the Diocese of Philadelphia until1864 and as the church for Katherine Drexel’s first Holy Communion and Confirmation services. It’s also the church where John Neumann resided when he became the Bishop of Philadelphia in 1852. Both Drexel and Neumann were later canonized as saints.\nOther videos in the series introduce visitors to the National Shrine of St. John Neumann, the Saint Katherine Drexel Mission Center and Shrine, the National Shrine of Saint Rita of Cascia, the Central Association of the Miraculous Medal – Mary’s Central Shrine and the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa. Films presenting the Cathedral Basilica of Sts. Peter and Paul; the Convent of Divine Love, home of the Holy Spirit Adoration Sisters, also known as the “Pink Sisters;” St. Augustine Church; and St. Francis Xavier-the Oratory are also in the works. Production on the series will be completed by early September, well in advance of the opening of the World Meeting of Families. The films will provide visitors with information about how to use SEPTA to access each location through public transportation, as well as suggestions for where to lunch, snack and shop before or after their visit.\n“Whether visitors are here for the World Meeting of Families and papal visit, for the upcoming visit by the Dalai Lama or any time of the year, we hope they’ll watch these accessible and short films and be inspired to tour our wonderful sacred sites,” says Meryl Levitz, president and CEO, VISIT PHILADELPHIA. “Religious freedom is deeply woven into the fabric of our region and having the opportunity to discover these sacred sites is one of the many reasons that 39.7 million people visited the region last year.”\nJack Ferguson, president and CEO, PHLCVB concurs. “The story of Philadelphia as a city founded on religious freedom and welcoming to people of all faiths is one that resonates not only with Americans but with people from all over the world, who travel here to learn more about what our city’s founder William Penn dubbed his ‘Holy Experiment.’ We hope that these videos will further motivate visitors to explore these sacred sites, which are truly an integral part of the Philadelphia experience.”\nSource:- VISIT PHILADELPHIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:49:06.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
