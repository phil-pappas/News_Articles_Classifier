Win-win ... Qantas has notched another victory, getting ACCC approval to coordinate services with China Eastern. Picture: AP Photo/Rick Rycroft Source: AP\nThe ACCC decision noted that Qantas and China Eastern would also coordinate the timing of connecting flights in both Australia and China to reduce total travel times.\n“The ACCC considers that the addition of a significant number of new services, and expanded range of destinations will constitute a significant public benefit,” said ACCC Chairman Rod Sims.\n“The ACCC has imposed conditions on the authorisation requiring Qantas and China Eastern to grow their capacity on routes between Australia and China Eastern’s hub in Shanghai by 21 per cent over five years.” Teaming up ... China Eastern has been given the green light to coordinate services between China and Australia. Picture: Brendan Radke/News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia\nThe competition watchdog had initially refused the application by the two airlines to coordinate their services because of the risk of a reduction in competition, leading to higher airfares.\nMr Sims said it was not uncommon for airlines to charge higher fares for passengers on a point to point route where competition was limited.\n“The ACCC considers that Qantas and China Eastern would have an incentive to adopt this strategy on the Sydney-Shanghai route if the alliance proceeds,” he said.\n“To enable the ACCC to monitor such behaviour, conditions have been imposed requiring Qantas and China Eastern to report to the ACCC their average fares, month by month, on each route between Australia and China on which they offer services.” Winners are grinners ... Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has had plenty to smile about this week. Picture: AAP Image/Paul Miller Source: AAP\nQantas CEO Alan Joyce said the decision would help the airlines deliver a “better travel experience for the growing number of customers travelling between the two countries, and strengthen Australia’s connections with China, a key trading partner”.\n“We put a strong case to the ACCC that outlined the benefits of this partnership for travellers as well as Australian tourism and trade,” said Mr Joyce.\n“China is Australia’s most valuable inbound tourism market, projected to contribute up to $9 billion annually to the Australian economy by 2020.”\nThe decision caps off a successful week for Qantas, which yesterday reported a $557 million net profit , representing a $3.3 billion turnaround on the previous year .\nMr Joyce also announced the airline would buy eight new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners to replace five of their oldest 747 jumbos.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b&title=Qantas+and+China+team+up+for+more+flights", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b&h=Qantas+and+China+team+up+for+more+flights", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b&title=Qantas+and+China+team+up+for+more+flights", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Qantas+and+China+team+up+for+more+flights&c=IT+may+look+like+a+great+partnership%2C+but+the+alliance+between+Qantas+and+Eastern+China+airline+is+being+watched+like+a+hawk+by+the+ACCC+watchdog.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/qantas-china-eastern-partnership-means-more-flights-to-china/story-e6frfq80-1227493092205?sv=6b8e21a2693aaaf00c922340b7f4781b"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T06:46:44.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
