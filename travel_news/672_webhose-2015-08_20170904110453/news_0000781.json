In fact, on some level, I had contempt for guys who cared too much about what they drove. Proof that I didn’t share their affliction, in my mind, was the fact that I had been driving the same beat-up base model Toyota pickup, with camper shell, for 23 years, ever since my father sold it to me for $4,000 in 1992.\nI had a strict maintenance philosophy — all necessary oil changes and tuneups — but I never spent a dime on fixing dents. Because again, I was not that kind of guy. I cared about reliable transportation, nothing else. My truck, in other words, represented anti-materialism, anti-attachment, a refusal to identify with material possessions. The banker with the Porsche was the guy with the problem. Not me.\nMy truck also represented utility: As a rock climber in my early 20s — sometimes with my dad, sometimes with buddies — I slept in the back a hundred times. In my later 20s, 30s and 40s, I drove the coast a thousand times with my surfboards in back. When I remodeled my house, I ferried many imperial tons of lumber in that truck. I made literally dozens of dump runs too, schlepping tens of thousands of pounds of construction debris. (On Saturday mornings, my daughters would sit beside me on the bench seat with blueberry muffins, chanting: ‘‘Treats in the truck to the dump with Dad! Treats in the truck to the dump with Dad!’’) It always ran. I turned the key; the engine started.\nThen one day last winter, while I was driving in rush-hour traffic to go surfing at Ocean Beach, the engine died. My little truck had never failed me for any reason other than lack of fuel, so I asked the Highway Patrol to tow it to a gas station. I filled the tank, but it still wouldn’t start. So I had it towed to a mechanic, who said it would cost $700 to diagnose and probably twice that to fix.\nI called my wife to say that my truck was finally dead. I felt a lump in my throat. Then I cried. Like, really cried. I thought: That’s weird, I’m crying over a car. What’s that about? I came up with psychological explanations: I’ve been really tense lately, feeling money worries.\nLives Short, powerful stories about meaningful life experiences.
