Complete with saloon, pistol shooting and with a view that's hard to drag your eyes from, he's called it Cowboy Paradise . \nBut his clientele has changed since a cycle trail was carved across six kilometres of his property. He and his staff, mostly young backpackers, hear the cyclists \"whooping and hollering\" as they come into sight of his 'Old West' town. \nHe's at a prime location on the West Coast Wilderness Trail - one of 23 trails in Nga Haerenga, the New Zealand Cycle Trail. SARAH-JANE O'CONNOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nRic Kean, owner of Westsiderides, says this summer will be a test for him as he has yet to make any money from the trail. \nRather than just run the trail along the coastline, where it would be relatively easy and quick, the wilderness trail hikes up the Arahura Valley from Kumara before dropping down to Lake Kaniere and Hokitika. It is 136km in total and graded level two for easy riding with only a couple of short steeper sections. \nMilne is right between the most strenuous sections, an excellent spot to catch people who need rest and refreshment. So these days his business is less about corporate functions and pistol shooting and he's having to thing about catering to the baby boomer cyclists who are already hitting the West Coast to test out the new trail . \nAnd it isn't even finished yet. Though the section from Greymouth to Hokitika was opened in November 2013 , the final section through to Ross has been delayed. The plan now is to have it complete for the goldmining town's 150th anniversary this Labour Weekend. SARAH-JANE O'CONNOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nAveril Lark, general manager of the Kumara Theatre Royal Hotel, which is building six new cabins aimed at cyclists. \nThough the trail starts in Greymouth, the bulk of its 180km lies in Westland and under the helm of the Westland District Council. Chief executive Tanya Winter came to town three years ago and took over where her predecessor had left off. She says she can't claim credit for the trail's existence - since it was established long before her arrival - but locals seem to agree she's got behind it since arriving. \n\"I felt it needed senior support in the council. It's what I would call a flagship project for a small council. It's not often you build assets $8.6m worth...for me there was a lot at stake.\" \nFunded via the Government's cycle trail kitty and Development West Coast, ratepayers have been spared the expense of construction though they will have to stump for maintenance. Sarah-Jane O'Connor \nDespite the warning sign, the West Coast cycle trail is not too technical. \nWinter says one lesson in hindsight was that they should have put a fulltime manager on the trail construction from the start, instead the work was \"tacked on\" to the roles of other council staff. Now they've used a contingency fund to bring on a fixed-term project manager to forge ahead with the Ross section. Ad Feedback \nAnd the work has taken longer than expected, Winter says, considering for most of Westland's section there was no tramline or likewise to follow. Instead they have carved track through bush, especially the section between Kumara and Hokitika. \n\"We haven't just pushed through bush and thrown down gravel, we've built a track that needs to sustain one of the highest rainfalls in the world and that has taken time.\" Sarah-Jane O'Connor \nThe trail must must survive heavy rainfall. Washouts in June along sections of the track cost $40,000 to repair. \nFinished or not, people have already started coming. For about a year track counters have tallied over 8000 trail users. Winter says the council's estimated 10,000 for the coming year and in a few years hope to hit 15,000 annually. \nIt'll need to start bearing fruit for the businesses that have dug deep and invested, then had to wait and watch as deadlines were missed and timeframes dragged out. \nBased in Rimu, alongside the Hokitika River, Ric Kean started West Side Rides in 2009. This summer is going to be the test for him. He's stuck it out, running cycle hire, accommodation and guiding alongside his music career. \n\"Last summer was the best one, the one before was okay, it's got better every year.\" \n\"I haven't been flat out yet . . . I'm not making any money on it yet. I'll look at the end of this season and sort of decide how far or where I'm going.\" \n\"If I was just relying on this I'd be closed by now...I'm lucky I've got other things I can do and other things to fall back on. I might even have to get a job next winter.\" \nKean says there are still plenty of business opportunities along the route, especially when Ross finally becomes the end-point of the trail, \"but there are a lot of people that are waiting for it to finish, because it's a bit overdue\". \nBut like Kean, not everyone has sat on their hands and waited. Many have plunged in and started, or expanded, their business based on the \"if you build it, they will come\" philosophy. \nUp at Kumara, the turn-off point between Greymouth and Hokitika, the Theatre Royal Hotel was in disrepair in 2010 when Kerrie and Mark Fitzgibbon bought it . \nTwo years' of toil brought it to what it is today: deluxe rooms themed for the times - it was built in 1876 - and drawing heavily on Kumara's most famous son, Premier Richard John Seddon. \nIt takes a certain audacity to plunge money into a small West Coast town like Kumara, banking on a cycle trail that hasn't even fully opened yet. But last summer bikes were a common theme at the hotel. \nIts spot at the end of the route from Greymouth means even if people aren't spending the night perhaps they're at least stopping for coffee or a meal before pedalling on. \nAn extra six cabins are being built for this summer behind the hotel specifically for cyclists. There will be outdoor baths looking over the bush, room for bikes and space to air out cycling garb. \nThis year the Fitzgibbons are off travelling - currently in Alaska - but have left the hotel in Averil Lark's capable hands. She ran Christchurch's Latimer Hotel for 40 years before the February 2011 earthquake called time on that part of her career. \nShe says the Fitzgibbons have made a significant investment, given they've yet to start making much money from the hotel, but \"their whole focus is the cycle trail and they believe in it\". \n\"Hats off to them, they made a huge personal investment in the future of the cycle trail and the town. They could see the future happening and they just had the vision and the passion.\" \nAs with Kean, this summer will matter. Lark says they will need to be prepared to cut back over winter. \"It's all very well to say, 'hey we can really cash in on the summer and make it work', you actually really need to put that into the business. So next winter we're going to have to just be on survival mode, offer less, open less hours.\" \nMilne's cowboy town is also expanding. It might seem the polar opposite of the opulence of the Theatre Royal, but the accommodation he's building is neat and tidy with wood decor for a warm, rustic feel. \n\"Cowboy Paradise isn't going to be everything for everyone, but hopefully most people will enjoy it,\" Milne says. \nLast summer he saw cyclists coming through but being ferried back to Hokitika for accommodation. So he's focused on building more units, hoping to start getting people into them in the New Year. \n\"We've got some advanced bookings already for this coming summer for 50 people or more a night and we haven't got that many beds, so I'm flat out.\" \n\"I think this beast, this cycle way, is exceeding anybody's expectations of what it possibly could have done. Which is a good thing for the community and a good thing for the businesses along the way.\" \nThe thing about a tourist attraction like a cycle trail is that it doesn't focus all the tourist dollars in one place. People need accommodation, but not all in one town. They need bikes and food and perhaps a guide or a ride back to their car at the other end. All these businesses could work in together without stepping on each other's toes. \nThere is still room for more, says Ashley Cassin, the project manager tasked with completing the final section. \n\"Unfortunately there's going to be gaps in the market . . . but hopefully that all comes on board soon.\" \n\"You've got [Lake] Mahinapua, you've got [Lake] Kaniere...no-one's doing anything at either of those. There's heaps of options there through some pretty special parts of the country.\" \nAs a cyclist himself, Cassin says while the wilderness trail is not the most technical of rides, \"there's some pretty cool bits of feature that you don't see on a lot of the other ones\". \nAnd there are other mountain bike tracks around the region that could be future projects for someone keen to push that aspect. The West Coast also has a second cycle trail, the Old Ghost Road, in Buller which has received a funding boost to help complete the final sections . \nAt a grade 3-4, Old Ghost Road is a \"whole lot more technical than what we've got,\" Cassin says. \"But we couldn't have two of the same trails. Grey and Buller couldn't operate what we do down here, otherwise you're just cutting each other's lunch. Whereas now it works quite well, there's something for everyone.\" \nWith the final completion in sight, the game will change to maintenance, improvements and getting people on their bikes. \nWinter says the councils have already budgeted for maintenance, $70,000 annually from Westland and $30,000 from Grey District Council to take care of its section. \nBut heavy rainfall in June flooded Hokitika and caused washouts along many sections of the track, a reminder that maintenance could be expensive in a region with such infamous rain. Though the repairs were completed within a month they cost $40,000, funded by a one-off grant. Winter says each big storm highlighted sections that needed to be future-proofed to be able to cope. \nEventually, maintaining and upgrading the trail should be covered by business partnerships, a method that New Zealand Cycle Trail manager Evan Freshwater says is working on other trails around the country. \nThat's where local businesses pay an annual fee to be part of the promotion of the trail, including some you might not expect to be tourist ventures. \nWinter has been surprised at some of the local businesses that got on board, like the chemist and an accountant. \n\"People who you think, oh they're not accommodation, or cafes or a bike hire place . . . but they can see the benefit to business of being a partner.\" \n\"In little communities where maybe the local pub might have closed down of there's shops that have been empty for a long time, you start to see little businesses opening up.\" \nOn paper, it sounds ideal. A tourist attraction that will slow people down, instead of seeing rental cars racing through to get to the glaciers. Something that encourages small businesses to crop up around the place, spreading the coveted tourist dollars around. \nThis summer, expect to see eyes out looking for bikes. How many people will visit, how much will they spend? \nIt's been a long time waiting for the trail to be finished, so once it's complete, will they come? - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T00:02:09.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
