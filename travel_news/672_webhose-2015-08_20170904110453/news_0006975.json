It was believed that Mohammed Rayhan was among 117 people who had died when government forces shelled the market place in Douma, just over six miles north east of Damascus. His family had given up all hope when he failed to return home and started mourning Mr Rayhan’s death. However after three days beneath the rubble he was extricated by rescuers. With the dust still embedded in his beard and long hair, he returned home. In doing so he interrupted the final day of mourning, much to the delight of his family. Pictures of his ecstatic relatives were posted on a Facebook page run by he Eastern Ghouta branch of the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a group of opposition activists. Mr Rayhan is s now being called the “Living Martyr” after his miraculous survival. \"Lots of people go missing, get lost in rubble, and only turn up later. However the story is not unique, according to Rami Abdurrahman, director of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"It often happens with children - I have heard of three-year-old children who have been mourned by their families and then found alive in rubble.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T03:09:56.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
