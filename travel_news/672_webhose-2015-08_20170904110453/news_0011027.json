Air Seychelles operates four-flights-per-week on a modern Airbus A320 aircraft that departs Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 04:00 on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and arrives in Seychelles the same morning at 06:55.\nRoy Kinnear, Chief Executive Officer of Air Seychelles said: “As the gateway into India with a population of more than 20 million people, Mumbai represents a strategically important point in our network.\n“Air Seychelles has carried thousands of passengers from Mumbai to Seychelles and travel demand has been so strong that we increased frequencies from an initial three flights-per week, to four-per-week in April 2015, providing a total of 1,088 return seats to and from the archipelago each week.\n“In May 2015, we made our islands more accessible to the Indian market by signing a codeshare agreement with Jet Airways for domestic flights between Mumbai and nine cities in India, including Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Cochin and Trivandrum. This has opened up seamless and convenient one-stop connections to Seychelles via Mumbai.\n“Going further, Air Seychelles offers some of the fastest connections over its Mahé hub in Seychelles to Antananarivo, Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Mauritius. The archipelago is geographically well-placed as a stepping-stone between India, East and South Africa and the Indian Ocean, and we have optimised our schedules to ensure that onward connections are short and convenient.\n“Whatever the final destinations, we are committed to ensuring that our guests in India experience a high level of service, both in the air and on the ground, where we have an excellent support team.”\nAir Seychelles has appointed and is represented by Jet Air as its General Sales Agent in India. The airline is also working closely with Jet Airways and more than 75 travel agents to develop its presence in the market and offer support services to the travelling public.\nMr Kinnear added: “There is a strong level of cooperation between Air Seychelles and the travel trade, which has committed to booking 800 seats on Air Seychelles in the coming weeks, with the aim of booking over 700 more for travel before the end of 2015.\n“This demonstrates the strong sales platform that we have developed in India and our commitment to continue driving tourism growth in the Seychelles, which remains the core engine of the economy.”\nSource:- Air Seychelles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:22:06.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
