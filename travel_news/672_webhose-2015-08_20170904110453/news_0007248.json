The organization's delegation met in Paris this week to vote in favor of a resolution that would excuse prostitution and brothel ownership. \nAs a staunch opponent of sex trafficking, Hof (star of HBO's \"Cathouse\" series and author of \"The Art Of The Pimp\") credits the human rights organization with taking a bold and progressive step towards eliminating exploitation. \n\"What I have done legally in Nevada is the continuation of a 60-year-old social policy that works effectively,\" Hof said. \"The legal prostitutes that work in my brothels are licensed and medically cleared of any diseases. The only people who aren't invited to my party are the pimps and underage girls. They can't meet the qualifications for licensing.\" \nHof points out that in Nevada, a brothel owner's license is harder to procure than a gaming permit. \"You have to be squeaky clean to do what I do legally. I understand that a lot of people may not like what I do, but the only way to rid our society of sex related crime and disease is to decriminalize it, regulate it, and hold people like me to the highest of standards.\" \nThe newly minted position has met with vocal opposition, including former president Jimmy Carter and actresses Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet, and Lena Dunham. Hof thinks they are misinformed. \"I'm issuing an invitation to President Carter and any of the celebrities who oppose Amnesty International's policy to be my guest at The Bunny Ranch and see it for themselves. I can't promise that I will change their personal opinion of my business, but I can tell you that there is no way they can come here and not leave with the enlightened view that decriminalizing prostitution is the safest way to eliminate the crime and health risk that comes with keeping the sex trade illegal.\" Asked if he believes that they will take him up on his offer, Hof quips,\"I can assure you they wouldn't be the first Hollywood celebrity or elected official to visit The Bunny Ranch. Their anonymity is always respected here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:31:59.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
