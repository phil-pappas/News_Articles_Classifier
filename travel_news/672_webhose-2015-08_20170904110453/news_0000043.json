A cold-weather Christmas is very appealing to those who enjoy all the traditional trimmings, and several major festivals, including Venice's famous carnival, take place in winter. \nAnother incentive is that fares are considerably cheaper than in the height of summer. You can cruise on MSC Preziosa or MSC Fantasia from just $50 a person, a day. Other lines operating winter cruises in the Mediterranean include Azamara Club Cruises, Costa Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Cunard, Princess, Swan Hellenic Cruises and the new Viking Ocean Cruise line. \nCelebrating Christmas at sea is also becoming a popular option – you can enjoy all the fun without doing the hard yards in the supermarket and kitchen. Viking Star will be cruising from Barcelona to Rome from December 22 to 30, so why not stay on for a couple of days and enjoy New Year's Eve, or La Festa di San Silvestro, as it's called, in the Eternal City?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:40:18.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
