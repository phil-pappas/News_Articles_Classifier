Grand Bohemian Hotel Charleston joins Autograph Collection Hotels , Marriott International's curated portfolio of hotels recognized for celebrating individuality. The Kessler Collection inaugurated the Bohemian infused property with a ribbon cutting ceremony and celebration featuring a progressive event designed to showcase hotel highlights, from an innovative wine blending experience and the largest art gallery in the Collection to unsurpassed views from the garden-influenced rooftop terrace. In a city where no building can be taller than the church steeples, few establishments offer this caliber of view and superior location, just steps away from famed Kings St. in the historic district. \"The opening of our first South Carolina hotel in Charleston - a location we've been scouting for over 10 years - is a great accomplishment and we look forward to enhancing the destination's celebrated hospitality scene,\" said Richard C. Kessler , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Kessler Collection. \"We offer guests unique experiences such as the hotel industry's first-of-a-kind Bohemian Wine Blending, lavish guest accommodations, and gourmet cuisine and craft cocktails at our rooftop terrace and restaurant, Eleve.\" In keeping with the Collection's passion for the arts and Bohemian lifestyle, the opening consisted of speeches by local dignitaries, the Kessler family and majority owner Xenia Hotel & Resorts executives, followed by cutting an authentically Charleston Lowcountry sweet grass adorned ribbon, and a champagne toast led by general manager Nick Saltmarsh . The festivities continued inside the hotel where local influencers and media members enjoyed Intelligentsia coffee, signature cocktails and sneak peek menu items from charcuterie to gourmet sweets. Building upon the property's debut, Grand Bohemian Hotel Charleston will continue delivering guests unparalleled offerings with new and highly valued experiences such as decadent seasonal menus, Grand Bohemian Gallery artist receptions, a 32-tap wine tasting room, and wine blending - an interactive 90-minute experience where guests learn the art of winemaking and customize their very own blend with personalized label to take home. Grand Bohemian Hotel Charleston is bathed in French elements combined with classical European lines all with a modern Bohemian twist. The 50-room luxury boutique hotel incorporates diverse offerings including an on-site Grand Bohemian Gallery featuring rare, local, international and original artwork, 3,000+ sq. ft. of meeting/event space, fitness center, wine blending experience and tasting room with curated selections, specialty coffee shop with micro-roasted coffee and pastry desserts, farm-to-table culinary offerings with a regional focus, as well as a rooftop restaurant, Eleve, and terrace providing unmatched views of the city.
