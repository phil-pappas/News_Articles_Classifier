Compliance for July was more than 99 per cent as the movement for minors totalled 216,259. July arrivals for foreign children were 128,839, with their departures at 87,420.\nThe department noted that travellers from Europe and America showed a slight increase for July (year on year) after showing slight declines for June (year on year).\n“There is no evidence conclusively to say that since the new immigration regulations took effect there has been a sharp decline in numbers of foreign travellers arriving in South Africa and that jobs had been lost,” the department said.\nWhen Statistics South Africa released its 2014 tourism industry report it noted that the salient characteristics of the 2014 tourists did not differ much from observations from previous years.\n“South Africa’s regulations are not onerous, but rational. They are applied similarly in some countries, including guidelines from the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada and the Schengen countries (the 26 European countries which have abolished passport and any other type of border control at their common borders),” the department said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:33:38.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
