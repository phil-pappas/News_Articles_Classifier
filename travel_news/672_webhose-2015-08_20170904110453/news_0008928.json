Safety Statistics \nThe number of deaths on the road has dropped significantly since the opening of the South Yungas road which now takes the majority of the vehicle traffic, but there are still a significant number of deaths that happen on Death Road every year. \nAn estimate in 2006 suggested that up to 300 people die each year on the route and in 2010, there had been 18 verified cycling fatalities on Death Road, which means it is vital to be careful as you ride. Riding on the Left Hand Side of the Road \nThroughout the rest of the country, Bolivians will drive on the right hand side of the road, but for those driving and riding on this road it is compulsory to ride on the left, although in many areas you can spread out across the road where there is less traffic. \nThe reason for this is that it means those heading downhill will always give way to those coming uphill, making the journey much safer for all concerned. Passing Other Cars and Vehicles on the Road \nIf you were to drive on the right hand side of the road on the way down, you would find that the passenger side of the vehicle was furthest out, which certainly doesn't help when things get narrow and you can't see the side closest to the cliff too well. You will have to pass on the outside, but make sure you give yourself enough space and don't try to pass any vehicles at speed. A slow pace is your friend in these situations. Ride at a Pace You Are Comfortable With \nWhile some people may be happy enough careering down this road at pace, it definitely isn't for everyone, and it is far more important that you reach the lowlands in one piece. It is worth discussing this with the company you will be riding with beforehand, to check that there is more than one guide to ensure that you won't get left behind unaccompanied. The Importance of Safety Equipment and Your Bike \nGood sturdy brakes and a well maintained bike will help you to survive in a pinch, and especially when the trail gets muddy you want a good brand of bike to be beneath you as you ride the Death Road. While it can be tempting to go for the cheapest option, those companies that give you all the right kit will be worth the small extra premium. Make Sure You Are Mentally Ready for the Trip \nRiding on Death Road is at times an experience that will not only get your adrenaline racing, but it can have a real element of fear as you look down over cliffs with a fall of up to six hundred feet to the valley floor below. While it is natural to get butterflies when looking over such a drop, if heights are a real problem for you, this is not the cycling trip for you. Discuss the Trip with Your Guide Before Starting the Route \nGetting a good guide is vital to help you make the most out of this wonderful day of downhill riding in Bolivia , and having a guide and a tour company that you are comfortable with and that has your confidence will make a big difference. The best guides won't emphasize traveling at pace, but will have their focus on safety as well as the wonderful experience you can enjoy as you ride. It is also worth checking to make sure your guides are first aid trained and have the right equipment for the journey.
