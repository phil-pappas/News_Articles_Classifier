The programme now includes an event first-thing on the Monday morning to start negotiations at WTM London, followed by an event on Thursday morning to help facilitate post-WTM London business deals.\nThe two sessions were attended by 303 buyers and 1,436 exhibitors and play a key role in WTM London 2014 facilitating a record £2.5 billion in industry deals, before WTM London 2015.\nWTM Buyers’ Cub Manager Raj Thakkar urged buyers to sign up to the Speed Networking sessions. The email inviting registrations will be sent to all WTM Buyers’ Club members in August.\n“The WTM Speed Networking sessions are vital in helping buyers and exhibitors conduct business negotiations and sign contracts,” he said.\n“Due to this the sessions are over-subscribed every year so buyers should apply immediately to avoid disappointment,” he said.\nWorld Travel Market London, Senior Director, Simon Press said: “WTM Speed Networking has been a great success since it was introduced in 2010. Both exhibitors and WTM Buyers’ Club members have really embraced the concept of quick initial business meetings to discover if there is an opportunity for further detailed discussions.\n“World Travel Market London’s purpose is to facilitate business deals between exhibitors and buyers and the WTM Speed Networking programme can only lead to WTM generating even more industry deals.”\nThe WTM Buyers’ Club is sponsored by India for WTM 2015.\nSource: WTM London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:08:35.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
