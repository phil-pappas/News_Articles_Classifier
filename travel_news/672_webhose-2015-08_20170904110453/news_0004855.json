Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 05, 2015 Adv: \nWhen flydubai airline at the end of October shifts up to 70 flights a week to over a dozen destinations to Dubai World Central, travelers to and from the airline’s East Africa destinations will not be affected, for now. \nThe Dubai-based, low-cost airline currently serves Entebbe, Bujumbura, Kigali, Kilimanjaro, Dar es Salaam, and Zanzibar, and all these flights will continue to operate in and out of Dubai International Airport, in short DXB. \nHowever, regular Gulf-based sources have suggested that the move of flights from DXB to DWC may be the start of a gradual shift to the Jebel Ali-based airport, as capacity for expansion at Dubai’s main airport gets ever more constricted while flydubai in turn continues to expand their fleet by at least eight aircraft every year. \nDestinations to be additionally served from DWC will be mainly regional and near-distance international departures to such airports like Muscat, Kuwait, Doha, Amman, and Beirut but also Kathmandu and Chittagong, while flights to all these destinations also continue from DXB. \nEmirates, the award-winning national airline of Dubai, has already given some indication that by 2025 they will shift the bulk if not all of their flights from DXB to DWC and flydubai is expected to have completed their move to what will become the world’s largest airport by then. Presently, the passenger capacity at DWC is only estimated to be sufficient for 7 million passengers a year, rising to over 25 million in 2018. When all development stages are complete, DWC will be able to handle 150 million passengers a year at which time it will become Dubai’s primary international passenger and cargo airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:48:32.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
