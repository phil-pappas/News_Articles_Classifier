It’s a move that has reduced the electricity bill for these “chillers” by a significant 16%. \nThe list of green innovations goes on, with Movenpick Resort & Spa Dead Sea becoming the first hotel in the Middle East to use solar-powered club cars for guest transportation. \n“In 2014, the average sustainability performance of Movenpick properties in the Middle East was 84%, which is 1% above the Green Globe international industry average,” says Hotelier. \nOver the last five years, Green Globe CEO Guido Bauer has been overseeing the annual sustainability certifications of Movenpick properties worldwide and has been impressed with the level of commitment by the company’s portfolio of hotels. \n“Movenpick’s Middle East properties were some of the first to benefit from our continuous improvement certification program having found numerous ways to improve environmental aspects of their surrounding communities. Most impressive is this region’s measurable gains in reducing global carbon pollution while conserving water, which is a most precious resource for all in the Middle East,” said Bauer. \n“Green Globe will be promoting many of Movenpick’s Middle East hotels to Gold Member status later this year in recognition of their year-on-year improvement and dedication to sustainability.” \nAbout Movenpick Hotels & Resorts \nMovenpick Hotels & Resorts, an international upscale hotel management company with over 16,000 staff members, is represented in 24 countries with 82 hotels, resorts and Nile cruisers currently in operation.
