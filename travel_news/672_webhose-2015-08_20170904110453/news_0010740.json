By Alan Behr TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE • Sunday August 30, 2015 5:00 AM \nWaves jostled the high-speed ferry as it bolted from the harbor at Philipsburg on St. Martin, aiming with churning indignation for St. Barthelemy. \nOn our three or four prior visits (my wife and I debate the number), we had taken the famously entertaining/unnerving 10-minute flight over. Riding in an airplane about the size of a banquet table, you make the landing approach by skimming a few feet over a hilltop traffic circle, then diving down the hillside to an undulating runway. If all goes according to the flight plan, you come to a halt before tipping into St. Jean Bay. \nThe catamaran ferry was much cheaper and, so we thought, would be gentler on our 6-year-old, Ryan. \nAs the rugged little island — with the familiar contradiction of brown-green jagged hills and stately white villas — appeared into view, Ryan got seasick. \nExclusivity is bred by inaccessibility, and the very difficulty in getting to St. Barts (in French, St.-Barth) makes it a destination for the type of people who want quiet, sophisticated relaxation — the occasional yacht-borne bacchanalia notwithstanding. The bulging, mass-market cruise ships moored in Philipsburg are too large to dock in St. Barts, and there are no large hotels. \nOur hotel, Le Guanahani, sat along Grand Cul de Sac in one of the many bays on the 8-square-mile island. Those bays shelter perfect white-sand beaches, snorkelers, kite-surfers and pleasure boats. \nOur bay-view suite was practically a small villa, complete with lush tropical landscaping and a large pool in back. \nAs with other hotels, ours was staffed by pretty young women from France, in for a couple years to practice their English, get some sun and make the place look even better. \nServer or served, a sense of uniform equality prevailed. The secret of St. Barts is that you do not feel that post-colonial tension of other places in the Caribbean — those formed by the evil of slavery and where the local population still serves (sometimes resentfully) interlopers from afar. \nTraveling to St. Barts as a family requires preparation. There are no all-inclusive options. It is an a la carte island, because the goal is to try the different beaches and many fine restaurants. \nWhen you have a first-grader, however, you need kid-friendly things to do, which is why we chose Le Guanahani. With only 67 rooms and suites, it is the largest hotel on the island. \nAlassai, the manager of the Kids’ Club, showed Ryan the facilities and, in turn, introduced him to the eight other youngsters staying at the hotel during our visit in the comparatively underpopulated summer offseason. \nRyan is studying French; the French kids were learning English. They all played bilingual games, and, this being France, they had a cooking lesson. \nOn our prior visits, all made before we were parents, the beaches were the definition of casual. Any woman wearing a bathing suit top betrayed poor fashion sense; among those who had the physique to pull it off, nudity was widely practiced on two strands, including our favorite, Saline Beach. \nThat was then — before everyone had a concealable camera that could send pictures around the world in less time than it takes Ryan to say (as is his wont), “I can see your butt.” We arrived at Saline this time to a couple dozen people in G-rated attire — splashing and playing in the water. \nWe drove back to the hotel just in time for our turtle-in-residence to appear, scavenging for castaway gourmet food. \nThen it was time for Ryan to work on his summer writing project for school, and here is the result: Daddy’s Driving Skills \nBy Ryan N. Behr \nWe went to St-Barth. A turtle came and I named him Yertle. He was the coolest. My daddy started the car. I said, “Run, Yertle, run!” \nI hasten to report that no turtles were injured in the making of this story. \nThe family settled into the St. Barts routine. Each morning, we had breakfast at the poolside, open-air Indigo restaurant, and Ryan would jump in with his kickboard before he had finished his pancakes and croissant. \nBetween Kids’ Club visits we would try the beaches, a favorite being Shell Beach, just above the orderly little capital of Gustavia. True to its name, it is a seashell collector’s open-air boutique. Sailing yachts drifted into the bay, and the restaurant and diurnal hangout Do Brazil served people on chaises longues parked on the beach just below its shaded terrace. \nThe master class in St. Barts beachgoing is a visit to Colombier, which requires a 25-minute hike down a treacherous cactus-lined path, nearly all of it narrow and covered with rough sand and jagged rock. I was nursing a puncture wound after a fall onto a sharp stone when a group from Puerto Rico came up the path; one of their number, Luis, had his arm in a bandage improvised from a shirt and was on his way to the hospital for stitches. \nA large blue cooler, containing wine and Champagne for a beach party that would not be, lay on the path 30 yards below, and beyond that, the ice dumped from it lay with cold irony on hot sand. By good luck or good fortune, Ryan and my wife made it down and back safely in their flip-flops and, while on the beach, enjoyed some of the island’s best snorkeling and marine-life viewing. \nAt dinner that evening, in L’Isola, one of the most fashionable of the island’s depots of gourmet cuisine and model-on-the-arm-of-banker partying, a man from Tyler, Texas, asked how he should get his beautiful wife and teenage daughters to Colombier. My wife and I called out nearly in unison, “Hire a boat, dude!” \nWe dined twice at Bartolomeo, the gourmet restaurant at Le Guanahani, which offered novelties such as a citrus-accented appetizer formed around a tartar of local fish. One of our favorite meals was at the Sand Bar, the beachfront restaurant run by Jean-Georges Vongerichten at the Eden Rock, which, built like a fortress atop a rocky outcrop in St. Jean Bay, was the first hotel on the island. \nMy entree was penne with ham and black truffles. \nOur favorite dining moment, however, was at Maya’s, the open-walled beachfront restaurant that, like so many others, we return to on each visit. Let Ryan tell you the story: Maya’s Restaurant \nBy Ryan N. Behr \nI went to Maya’s in St-Barth. I got sleepy. I fell asleep in the restaurant. The waitress made me a bed of chairs. I felt happy. \nWhen we were done, I carried Ryan out, shaking Chef Maya’s hand while cradling Ryan’s head in the crook of my right elbow. \nOn our final morning, as dawn broke over the bay and Ryan slept, my wife and I returned to our St. Barts roots by skinny-dipping, this time in private in our suite’s pool. \nNeptune, the god of the seas, commanded smooth sailing for our boat heading back to St. Martin. St. Barts receded behind us, melding with the sea that nurtured it. \nSt. Barts had done its good work, adding to the joyful memories of three (or was it four?) visits before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T21:28:37.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
