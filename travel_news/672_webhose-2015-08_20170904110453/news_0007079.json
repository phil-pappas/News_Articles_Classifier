California artists apply their distinctive styles in exploring the beloved cultural tradition, celebrated with sugar skulls, altars and offerings to dead loved ones and ancestors. Visitors are welcome to leave photographs and remembrances at a Community Altar. If Day of the Dead just doesn’t feel right until fall, the museum’s Halloween Party is Oct. 16. \nVitals: Tuesday-Jan. 3; see website for museum hours. Free-$9. 1020 O St., Sacramento. (916) 653-7524. www.californiamuseum.org. \nIn praise of mountain men: The rugged hunters and trappers who pioneered the Santa Cruz Mountains in the early 1800s get their due during Roaring Camp Railroad’s Summer Gathering of Mountain Men. In addition to riding a steam train into the mountains — or, alternatively, a diesel train to the beach — passengers will get to walk through wilderness camps populated by frontiersmen demonstrating their survival skills and feast on a chuck wagon barbecue. Saturday- \nnext Sunday, Aug. 22-23. $27-$29 adults, $20-$23 children; parking $8. (831) 335-4484. www.roaringcamp.com. \nNoshing through Benicia: With restored 19th century Victorian and Old West buildings — including the brick former state Capitol — as a backdrop, Benicia’s Taste of First Street offers a chance to sample many of the restaurants lining the waterfront downtown’s main street. Flavors run the gamut from Indian, Mexican and Thai to pizza, barbecue and Italian, including a bakery and a coffeehouse/bar/lounge for good measure. Aug. 25, 6-9 p.m. $35/two for $55 (includes two glasses of wine).
