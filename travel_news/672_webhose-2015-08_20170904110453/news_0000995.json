If we put up enough of them in one spot, does it deplete the power of the winds in those passes?\nThis is sort of a hazy area. We wouldn’t know for sure until wind farms cover a much greater area than they do today.\nHowever, according to a “Scientific American” article from Feb.14, 2014, researchers have found those turbines when concentrated in a small area possibly can have an effect on the rainfall and temperatures .
