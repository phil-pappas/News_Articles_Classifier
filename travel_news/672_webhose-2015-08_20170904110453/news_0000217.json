The aim of the drive was to fill almost 50 employment opportunities in various fields such as events, operations and food and beverage, as the Centre prepares to launch a new and exciting era for Oman’s business events industry. \n“The response to this third recruitment drive has been impressive, not just in terms of the interest it has generated and the number of applicants it has produced, but also in terms of the quality of the applications we have received,” said Trevor McCartney, the OCEC General Manager. McCartney added, “While job creation for Omani nationals is a priority for the OCEC, all appointments will be made on individual merit and successful applicants will have the satisfaction of knowing they have earned their position in the face of tough international competition.” Over the next 15 years the OCEC and its surrounding precinct will be responsible for the creation of up to 24,000 direct and indirect jobs, contributing up to OMR240 million to the national economy. It is also expected that the OCEC will spur the creation and growth of Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with design and print, transportation, food and beverage, event management, security and IT services directed towards Omani businesses. The employment campaign was promoted in domestic and international media, as well as across several online platforms including OCEC’s social media channels, leading international job-site Naukri and at Sultan Qaboos University, the National Hospitality Institute and the Oman Tourism College. The campaign attracted more than 7,000 views on the OCEC website and in excess of 20,000 on Naukri.
