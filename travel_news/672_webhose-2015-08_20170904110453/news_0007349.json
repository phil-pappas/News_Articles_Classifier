You can find more of her news and recommendations at arizonahiking.blogspot.com.\nHiding across the street from the horse corral at the busy recreational hub of Mormon Lake Lodge is a sweet little trail that's packed with interest. If you can get past the multiple distractions near the trailhead (horses, cowboys, saloon, lake views, aroma of mesquite), a hike up Navajo Spring Trail offers respite from the commotion of the Mormon Lake Lodge-area trails and Passage 30 of the Arizona Trail.\nThe hike begins as an easy stroll through meadows and ponderosa pines. As the trail ascends along a ridge above a drainage, the woodlands get thicker and the chipping squirrels more profuse before you enter a clearing where wire fencing protects aspen seedings from marauding wildlife.\nHere, just downhill from a prolific spring, reliable moisture fosters a bevy of wildflowers. Fields of wild bergamot, Mexican silene, wild geranium and red cinquefoil bloom bright in a boot-brushing color mania. Beyond the aspens, a conga line of concrete water troughs arcs around the green pastures of Navajo Spring. This is a good turn-around spot for an easy hike. For those who want a longer trek, the Arizona Trail and the lodge’s trail system are just yards away.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona hike: Carr Lake trails\nMormon Lake Lodge offers a free trails map for resort guests. The map, which was was created by David Babcock, Arizona Trail Association Webmaster and trail steward and Larry Snead, Mormon Lake Lodge environmental programs manager (and former AZT executive director), shows the layout of roughly 13 miles of linking routes.\nHere's one loop to try: Follow Navajo Springs Trail 1.1 mile to the AZT junction, turn right (north) and continue 1.6 miles to Forest Road 90N (not signed, but it's the first big road intersection). Head right (north east) on FR 90N and hike 0.4 mile to the Fakowie Trail (FR 90J), turn right and hike 1.7 miles back to the trailhead following the “lodge” directional signs.\nCheck out our hiking board on Pinterest!\nLength: 2.2 miles up and back or 4.8-mile loop.\nRating: Easy.\nElevation: 6,880-7,550 feet.\nGetting there: From the intersection of State Routes 87 and 260 in Payson, go 37 miles north on SR 87 to Lake Mary Road, just past the village of Clints Well. Turn left and go 27 miles to Mormon Lake Road (Forest Road 90). Turn left and drive 2 miles to Mormon Lake Lodge. Park in the dirt lot behind the reservation office and horse corral. Hike begins at the Environmental Education Center across the road between the pizzeria and the “national bank.”\nDetails: www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_30.html , www.mormonlakelodge.com .\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona hike: Walnut Meadows to Walnut Canyon", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6de839b5a2325f7f6993692555f4ddff814fe33/c=269-0-1331-1062/local/-/media/2015/07/30/Phoenix/B9318258352Z.1_20150730155320_000_GEMBG3944.1-0.jpg", "http://www.aztrail.org/passages/pass_30.html", "https://www.pinterest.com/azcentral/azcentralcom-arizona-hikes/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6de839b5a2325f7f6993692555f4ddff814fe33/c=269-0-1331-1062/local/-/media/2015/08/07/Phoenix/B9318337553Z.1_20150807154849_000_GHGBI2B35.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-19T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T00:38:16.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
