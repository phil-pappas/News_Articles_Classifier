Today, the \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative proposed by the Chinese government will bring new opportunities of cooperation between China and Africa . Air China's forthcoming Beijing - Johannesburg service will be a \"Silk Road in the Air\" and a new bridge of international cooperation, bringing Asia and Africa closer and facilitating the exchanges between China and Africa . 2015 marks the year when Air China returns to Africa .
