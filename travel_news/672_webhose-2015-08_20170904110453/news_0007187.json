This year the Napoleonic Association joined the Battle Proms fresh from the battlefields of Waterloo, where they had participated in the Waterloo 200 programme of events, while Crown & Empire were also on hand with dramatic cavalry displays showing the ‘skill-at-arms’ that would have been seen in Belgium 200 years ago. Each year the concert raises funds for Combat Stress, the Veterans’ Mental Health Charity, which specialises in helping veterans of the Armed Forces and Merchant Navy with psychological injuries caused through service to their country. This year £8,986.96 was raised from audience donations at the Ragley Battle Proms! Said Amie Allen of Combat Stress: “We are delighted to be working with the Battle Proms again, and to date have raised over £225,000 at various concerts over the years. We would like to offer our sincere thanks to the generous Ragley Battle Prommers, many of whom attend year on year and never fail to surprise us with their generosity.” The Battle Proms will return to Ragley on Saturday 20 August 2016.
