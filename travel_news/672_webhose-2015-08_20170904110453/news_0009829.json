Thai AirAsia is ready to open its newest flight base \"U-Tapao\", its fifth after Don Mueang, Phuket, Chiang Mai and Krabi, with flights to two Chinese cities; Nanning in the southwest (4 flights weekly; Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) and Nanchang in the southeast (3 flights weekly; Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday). The airline is confident that Pattaya 's popularity and appeal to Chinese travelers will stimulate the economy at the end of this year. Tassapon Bijleveld, CEO of Thai AirAsia, stated at a press conference in Nanchang today (31 August) that AirAsia is very excited to be debuting new routes from its fifth flight base, U-Tapao ( Pattaya ) International Airport. He lauded Nanchang as a city of world heritage that is home to many of China's \"greatest\" sites such as Lushan Mountain and Wuyuan Village; China's greatest countryside attractions, The Star of Nanchang; China's greatest Ferris wheel and the world's second largest, as well as China's greatest porcelain at Jingdezhen. He voiced confidence that Thai travelers will definitely enjoy the new destination, especially those from the east who will now have a convenient and low cost option to travel to China. \"We believe that tourism in the east and Pattaya is growing very rapidly and that U-Tapao Airport is absolutely ready to accommodate regular flights. These beliefs led us to creating our latest flight base and we chose the two Chinese cities of Nanchang and Nanning as its first routes. With plans to expand to other routes both domestic and international we have targeted acquiring 2 Airbus A320s for a fleet at U-Tapao\" Tassapon said. For the U-Tapao to Nanning route, available four times per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday), Thai AirAsia held a press conference on the same day (31 August) in Nanning with Santisuk Klongchaiya, Thai AirAsia Director of Commercial, in attendance. Nanning is an important economic city in the south of China that allows for quick connection to Guilin, where travelers can cruise the Lijiang River at Yangshuo to relax among the mist, water and mountains or savor Guilin's signature noodles. Nanning is connected to Guilin by high speed train, making the two locations only two and a half hours apart. A one hour flight is also available.
