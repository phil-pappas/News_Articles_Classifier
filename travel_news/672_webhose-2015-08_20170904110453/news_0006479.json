Here, I’ve added a little sage, to infuse with the sugar syrup, and some fresh mint – which makes the lemonade all the more refreshing. SERVES 8-10 INGREDIENTS For the syrup: 120g caster sugar a small bunch of fresh sage For the lemonade: 4 lemons a few sprigs of fresh mint METHOD To make the syrup, put the sugar, 100ml water and the sage in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil for 3-5 minutes, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for a further five minutes. Lift out the sage and discard it, then set the syrup to one side to cool. It will keep for a few days in the fridge. Halve the lemons and squeeze the juice into a large jug, top with 800ml cold water, then add the sage syrup to taste. Throw in a few sprigs of fresh mint and serve chilled over ice.
