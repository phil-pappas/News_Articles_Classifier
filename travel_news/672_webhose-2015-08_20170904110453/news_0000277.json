Florida Finds By NAPS, North American Precis Syndicate Star Local Media | 0 comments \n(NAPSI)—When it all becomes a little too much, many say, there’s nothing like the gentle joys of a tranquil and relaxing vacation in a seaside town with “old Florida” charm. \nOver the years, idyllic Englewood in Sarasota County has remained true to its roots while developing into a resort town. \nOne of the area’s barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico, Manasota Key, features charming communities and four beaches. Manasota Beach’s sand dunes and mangroves attract nature lovers, while Englewood Beach offers grills, picnic tables, pavilions and outdoor sport facilities. Stump Pass Beach is excellent for hiking and exploring Florida’s natural flora and fauna. \nWhat To See And Do \n• Fishing in Englewood, originally settled as a grove town to grow lemon trees, offers some of the best whether by boat, kayak, charter or from the shore. There’s even a fishing tourney for families every October as part of the Englewood Beach WaterFest. \n• Lemon Bay Park and Environmental Center has 208 acres of trails and various species of animals. \n• When you’re not on the water, you can shop along West Dearborn Street in Olde Englewood Village. \n• The area’s restaurants celebrate “Let’s Eat, Englewood” in the fall with three-course dinners for just $23 and two-course lunches for $12. \nFor further information, go to http://visitsarasota.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:42:55.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
