Whether this is due to a lack of ecotourism options or a lack of affordable ecotourism options is debatable, but one thing is for sure: it represents a stunning opportunity for accommodation providers and tour operators. \nCertain destinations within Australia are particularly popular with travellers who say they’d like a total ecotourism experience on their next holiday. For example, almost 45% of Aussies planning to go to the Ningaloo/Coral Bay/Exmouth region in Western Australia on their next trip would like their trip to be eco-friendly – more than double the national average. ‘For my next holiday, I’d really like a total ecotourism experience’ by destination intention Source: Roy Morgan Single Source (Australia), July 2013–June 2015 (n=32,676) . \nPeople planning to visit the Dandenong Ranges/Yarra Valley area outside of Melbourne (39.5%), Mt Buller in snow season (38.7%) and Kalgoorlie (38.4%) are also considerably more likely than the average Australian to express interest in a total ecotourism experience. \nCuriously, only 12.7% of Aussies planning to visit the Whitsundays — a destination renowned for its natural beauty and pristine beaches — on their next trip show any interest in an ecotourism experience.
