The Bentonville-based museum says the Bachman-Wilson house will open Nov. 11. The museum acquired the home in 2013, and the entire structure was taken apart and brought to northwestern Arkansas. The home was then reassembled on the grounds of Crystal Bridges.\nThe museum says the home is an example of Wright's classic Usonian architecture, which he developed during the Great Depression. Crystal Bridges says the Usonian homes were simpler and lower-cost than Wright's more elaborate, highly customized homes.\nAbout 120 Usonian homes were built.\nTax to be added on rentals in Paris\nPARIS » The home-sharing company Airbnb has agreed to put a small tourist tax on rental apartments in Paris — following a request by Paris authorities.\nIn a statement Tuesday, Airbnb said it would collect 0.83 euros ($0.95) per person per day to be paid by lodging tourists from Oct. 1.\nParis' City Hall said that it's a move to bring Airbnb more in line with city hotels, which already pay the tax and are bearing the brunt of increased competition. Parisian hosts are already required to pay income tax.\nMotherhood show opens in Milan\nMILAN » They called it \"The Great Mother,\" but organizers of an exhibition focusing on motherhood opening this week on the sidelines of the Milan Expo world's fair may just as well have been called \"Mamma mia.\"\nCurator Massimiliano Gioni said there was some irony in the choice of theme \"because motherhood and the mamma is part of the Italian stereotype, and we wanted to play with that.\"\nThe exhibition, which previewed Tuesday, features 400 works by 139 artists, including Cindy Sherman and Yoko Ono, and focuses on motherhood as a form of nourishment to accompany the exposition's theme of feeding the planet.\nThe exhibition at Palazzo Reale, organized by the Trussardi Foundation, runs through Nov. 15.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T00:24:31.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
