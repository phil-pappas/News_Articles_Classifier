Aside from the oddly popular ' old people dancing ' videos (of which there are over 7 million) the lack of content or channels on Youtube produced by anyone over the age of 30 is painfully obvious. Though that doesn't mean they don't exist. Here are five Youtubers who prove you don't need to be young to succeed on the internet. 3 Golden Sisters The premise of 3 Golden Sisters is simple - Mary, Josie, and Teresa get together every Wednesday to have lunch and discuss the latest topics to take over social media. Justin Bieber's 2014 arrest , Robin Thicke's controversial Blurred Lines , Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's \" conscious uncoupling \", and more scandals to rock pop culture have all been a topic of discussion around the lunch table for these three ladies. Three years and over 7 million views later, the 3 Golden Sisters have proved so popular they even had their own television series on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Peter Oakley Better known as ' geriatric1927 ' 86-year-old Peter Oakley was, to many, the grandfather of the internet. From August 2006 to February 2014, he posted a series of short autobiographical videos under the title 'Telling it All' where he told stories of his time serving as a radar mechanic during World War II or how to find the hashtag button on the keyboard. At one point, Oakley was the most subscribed user on Youtube, the only person from the UK to ever done so, and remained at the top spot for 31 days. Over 50 and Fantabulous The first video on the channel, \" Over 50 and Fantabulous \" begins with a brutally honest confession: \"Hi there, I've been watching Youtube videos. They're all about young people and I'm tired of looking at them. I'm tired of twerking, I'm tired of screaming. This channel is going to be for old people. We're going to talk about old stuff; grey hair, sagging butts, sagging breasts, menopause, cranky men, wanting to have sex, wanting to have too much sex, trying to date younger men, being stupid. You know, that kind of thing.\" Over the last year, the channel has racked up more than 500,000 views, thanks to a series of videos showcasing the uncensored \"opinions of we 'well seasoned' individuals\". Great Depression Cooking For six years, 98-year-old cook, author and great grandmother, Clara Cannucciari cooked meals, shared recipes and told stories about her childhood during the Great Depression to an audience of over 70,000 subscribers. Her most popular video, \"The Poorman's Meal\" has over 1 million views and shows her making potatoes and hot dogs. She posted her last video in November 2013, and died a few weeks later. Grand Illusions Thanks largely to Reddit , 71-year-old Tim Rowett has developed a dedicated internet following, boasting over 200,000 subscribers on the channel, Grand Illusions. Despite amassing over 28 million views in the last five years, the concept of Grand Illusions is incredibly simple. Tim, who has been collecting toys for over 30 years, will demonstrate how a toy works - from his collection of over 20,000 - before explaining how the mechanism inside also works. A great one for the grandkids. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:44:21.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
