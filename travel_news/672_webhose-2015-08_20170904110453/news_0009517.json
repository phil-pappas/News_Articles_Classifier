Thredbo’s looking pretty good right now, but is it good value? Source: News Corp Australia \nSKIING is crazy expensive. But so worth it. Something happens in your brain when you spend an afternoon in soft powder snow. You forget your troubles. You’re happy. \n(Yes, this also applies if you’re a snowboarder!) \nIt’s winter in Australia and the ski resorts are looking as good as they have in years. The snow gods are throwing the white stuff down with benevolence. \nBut should you ski in Australia? \nWould you be better off saving your money and going somewhere else instead? \nNew Zealand is a short flight and their resorts — which make ours look petite — are covered in more white crystals than you can poke a pair of planks at. \nTreble Cone in the South Island had 46cm of snowfall in one night last week. \nBut maybe you could do even better by waiting and skiing while everyone else is at the beach. Japan’s skiing is famous for a reason. Then, if you want to get really serious, there’s Canada and the USA. \nShould you go there? Or is the Aussie dollar too low now? It gets complex. Let’s break it down. \nI’ve collected costs for flights, a week’s accommodation and ski tickets for five resorts around the world. In the foreign countries, deals I found included a ski pass built into the accommodation cost. \nHere’s how they compare: The cheapest option is a week in Thredbo. Source: Supplied \nThe cheapest thing to do is take a week at Thredbo (based on their September holiday special), although New Zealand is not far behind. In the foreign countries, deals I found included a ski pass with accommodation, built into the accommodation cost. \nI tried to choose options that are cheap, although not always the absolute cheapest. Why? Because that’s how I’d do it if I was booking my own holiday. I added $400 for travel connections and the high cost of ski meals, etc. \nIn each place you could find something cheaper if you tried, and it would be easy to find more expensive options. \nAnd here’s another thing. If you go to Thredbo or New Zealand for a week, you can pretty easily get six days skiing in. If you fly to those other places, your time gets squeezed. \nIn Canada, the USA or Japan you’ll probably only get five days skiing in your week. That’s why we next have this chart that breaks down the price per day you actually spend with your boots on. Australia looks even better when you look at the price per day. Source: Supplied \nAt this stage, things are starting to look pretty obvious. Skiing in Australia is our best option! Why would anyone bother with their passport and all those tricky foreign coins? \nHere’s your answer . This graph shows snow depth in Australia for the last two years. It’s dicey. Source: Supplied \nSnow in Australia is just not that reliable. This year we waited until mid-July before there was anything much. A ski holiday without natural snow is possible thanks to snow-making, but it’s never quite the same. \nFurthermore, it’s flat here. Our ancient continent has seen very little plate tectonics. That means less of the tall steep geography you get in Japan, NZ and the US West Coast. Not Australia. Source: AP \nThe vertical drop at Whistler is more than twice that at Thredbo, (which itself is \nalmost twice that at Perisher or Falls Creek) \nSkiing in its pure form is not about seeing tanbark poking through and riding the \nchairlift 30+ times a day. Once we adjust for quality, the northern hemisphere \nstarts to look a little better. \nYou can see I rated Thredbo 1, New Zealand 1.5 and the northern hemisphere \nresorts a 2. I divided the price by these “quality factors” to make the \ncomparisons fairer. \nSkiing in its pure form is not about seeing bits of tanbark poking through and riding the chairlift 30+ times a day. Once we adjust for quality, the northern hemisphere starts to look a little better. You can see I rated Thredbo 1, New Zealand 1.5 and the northern hemisphere resorts a 2. Source: Supplied \nIt makes the NZ resort the best value, with Niseko hot on its heels, then Whistler, then Thredbo. Park City is last. \nI admit these quality ratings are totally subjective! If you’re a beginner the reverse is probably true. A local resort is probably a better place to learn. But if you’re a powder hound or a snow bunny, the numbers above may just ring true. \nThere’s one more wrinkle to look at. The price per day of skiing in Australia is pretty constant whether you ski one day or 20. Expensive international flights don’t factor in. If you’re coming from Perth or Darwin you might want to stay for more than a weekend, but the rest of the country can do a two-day jaunt. \nWhat if you want to go skiing for three weeks? If you’re going for three weeks and you’re looking for good quality snow, Canada is the best value. Source: Supplied \nThis time, the resort of Whistler in Canada — just north of Vancouver — wins easily. Rated the number three resort in the world , it’s easy to see why so many young Aussies head over there for long stints. If you’ve ever been to Whistler, you know the number of Aussies there is surprising. They even call it “Whistralia.” \nThis is why. \nJason Murphy is an economist.
