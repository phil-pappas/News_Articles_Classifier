This could be a photo of an icy tundra, a scorching desert or something that shows the extremes of both. As always, feel free to interpret the theme as broadly as you like and don’t forget to tell us where you took the shot! \nJudges \nYour work will be reviewed by former Time photo editor Erica Campbell, New York Times contributing photographer Jared Kohler and BBC Travel contributing editor Richard Conway. The winner will join the ranks as a BBC Travel Photo nomad and the winning shot will be featured on BBC.com. \nDeadline \nSubmissions will close Monday 17 August, and finalists will be announced the week of 24 August. Our judges will name a winner at the end of the month. \nNext month, we'll be looking for photographs that epitomize the view from the open road. See last month’s finalists and the winner for the theme of unbreakable . \nExamples \nWant to know what photos make us shiver and sweat? Here are some inspiring photos we love:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T08:29:07.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
