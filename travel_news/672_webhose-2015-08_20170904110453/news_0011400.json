The top-notch properties in the French capital have openly vented their anger regarding the growing popularity of Airbnb among global travelers.\nAirbnb now offers more than 50,000 flats and houses for rents growing up from a few thousand that it used to offer in 2012. Rents ranging from €150 (£109) a night to €1,000 (£730) in Paris makes the city the biggest market for Airbnb worldwide.\nAirbnb’s growing popularity has enraged hotels including some of the city’s five-star “palaces”. Moreover, the civilians of the city have also complained about the noisy guests invading the peace and quiet localities. However, in an attempt to appease the growing dissatisfaction, Airbnb has agreed to collect a minimum daily tourist charge levied on hotel guests by the Paris town hall.\nTravelers visiting Paris and availing the flats or residential properties by Airbnb have to pay extra 0.83 euro centimes per person per night. These taxes will directly go to the city authorities. Airbnb director in France revealed that they are happy with the simplified tax process and will continue its strong relationship with the French authorities.\nThe recent undertaking is believed to assuage the anger of hotel owners and managers temporarily. The Airbnb poses a strong competition for the Paris hotels as the homes offered by the company are relatively cheaper. Moreover, the luxury flats are proving to be quite popular among celebrities and other potentates, who are finding Paris hotels too ‘public’.\nThe hotels complain that the competition is unfair because home owners – who are allowed under French law to sub-let their home for 12 weeks a year – do not face the same burden of regulation and taxes.\nFor its part, Airbnb has previously stated that it is not in competition with luxury hotels, saying the accommodation offered provides a different experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:09:07.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
