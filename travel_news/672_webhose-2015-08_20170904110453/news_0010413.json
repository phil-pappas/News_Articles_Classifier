He believes it hints at the secret railroad switch that the Nazis were said to have built to redirect trains into a massive network of underground passages.\nNazi Germany had concentration camp inmates build the huge tunnels -- code-named Riese (Giant) -- to notably shelter Adolf Hitler and his associates.\n- 'Gold Train' tee-shirts -\nThe train's exact location was supposed to be kept under wraps but curious onlookers can already be seen loitering around where X marks the spot.\nMost joke about finding gold bars but one young couple with two children say they live nearby and are worried their house may be in danger if the tunnel is found to be booby-trapped as is suspected and explodes.\nNo such concerns at the nearby Ksiaz Castle, once known as Furstenstein, whose only source of revenue is tourism. It will be swarming with crowds if the train proves to be real.\n\"I don't have any concrete evidence to show the train exists, but reliable sources have confirmed it to me and I would love for it to be true,\" said Ksiaz castle manager Krzysztof Urbanski.\nThe massive 400-room castle \"is already reaping the benefits of a kind of Loch Ness Monster effect,\" he added.\n\"No one's seen the monster but that doesn't stop it from attracting people.\"\nEver the effective administrator, he is already preparing promotional material: starting next week tourists will be able to buy \"Gold Train\" T-shirts.\nThe castle is equipped with some of the underground Nazi passages -- which perhaps still have a secret or two to reveal.\n\"We found a document detailing the amount of building material brought here for the facilities meant to welcome the Fuhrer,\" said Urbanski.\n\"But according to experts, only about half of that material is found in the parts of the castle that we known of.\"\nSlowikowski, the retired miner, stands in his Walbrzych garage and shows off his model of the secret tunnels including a miniature version of the train he has sought for 30 years.\n\"I'm 100 percent sure the train exists, but we don't know what it was carrying,\" he told AFP.\n\"Now it needs to be dug out. And if it turns out to be a hoax, then its instigator will have to pay.\"\nÂ© Provided by AFP Rumoured discovery of Nazi train sets Polish gold rush ", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nazi", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmcISZ.img&quot;}}", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdK9hQ%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdJR3U.img&description=Rumoured+discovery+of+Nazi+train+sets+Polish+gold+rush+-+Provided+by+AFP", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelnews&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTim", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdKgZZ.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBm7sl2.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA5ZTIC&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T11:02:22.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
