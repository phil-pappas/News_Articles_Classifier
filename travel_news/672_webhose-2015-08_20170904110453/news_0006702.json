Today, as an internationally renowned contemporary artist his work is exhibited all over the world.\nThe former paralympian-turned-painter stands by the piece on London life as it nears completion\nDuring July, between the hours of 2pm-6pm, Gregory painted ‘live’ in The Cumberland lobby creating a bespoke collage of his journey throughout London, sourcing inspiration from the hotel’s iconic location, guest experiences and staff memories of the capital city.\nAnd once the masterpiece was finished, Travelmail decided to pay a visit to inspect the work and chat with the Artist-in-Residence.\n AN INSPECTOR CALLS: There's not much to fault at The George...

New York's autumn collection: Why you SHOULD visit the city... 13 shares The most unique thing about this installation is that not only is it for the people, but it is by the people too. While Burns had his own ideas on what London is all about, basing himself in the hotel lobby enabled him to listen to what the general public talked about in the capital.\nSo while a booking at the Cumberland will bring you sharp, modern, bright and airy rooms in one of London's most tailored hotels, it now offers the opportunity to admire the very reasons why you're in England's capital city.\nThe Cumberland Hotel is eager for visitors to check out Gregory Burns' masterpiece in the lobby area\nGregory admitted to listening to tourists and their opinions on London when painting the piece\nThe painting itself encapsulates not only what tourists may pick as key sites and landmarks of London, but also what it means to the locals. While I won't spoil it for you, some of the features on show are clearly distinguishable and some will focus the mind.\nGregory is a charming character. It's clear to see the word 'defeated' does not figure in his vocabularly. He was diagnosed with polio in 1958 aged only six moths old that resulted in paralysis from the waist down.\nYet he went on to break five world records in paralympic swimming and numerous national records.\nAfter a pleasant evening with Gregory Burns, it was time to retire to my equally artistic bedroom suite\nThe Cumberland Hotel is clean, bright and airy throughout and offers something for everyone\nA MASTER IN FINE ART Gregory Burns has held 80 solo and group painting exhibitions in a dozen countries throughout the world since 1980 and has been the celebrated Artist-in-Residence at 25 5-Star Resorts and venues since 1999.\nHe has published two books in English and Mandarin and has been featured on BBC, CNBC, ESPN, CNA, CCTV and in The AWSJ, Time Magazine and The China Daily.\nHis skillset did not end there. His paintings have been shown in dozens of solo exhibitions plus dozens of group exhibitions in at least 16 countries. He is also a world-renowned motivational speaker, helping others learn that adversity is there to be beaten.\nThe masterpiece is in the hotel lobby until the end of Augusts. Guests and visitors are invited to view the painting, and the restaurant and bar are both open for bookings.\nBurns said: ‘I love exploring London, taking my art pad wherever I go. Thanks to The Cumberland Hotel I have a chance to speak to guests and staff from all over the world and capture what London means to them.\n'My painting is inspired by a collection of people with personal experiences and I look forward to adding to it over the next few weeks.’\nGregory gave up some of his time to speak with people in the conference room of the Cumberland Hotel\nHOW TO BOOK YOUR 'ART-FULL' STAY AT THE CUMBERLAND To stay at The Cumberland and enjoy the ‘Art-full’ stay experience click here or Quote: 'Art-full stay' via the phone booking service on 0871 376 9014.\nRead more: Hotel Deals - The Cumberland Hotel", "external_links": ["http://www.guoman.com/hotels/united_kingdom/london/the_cumberland/hotel_offers/an_art-full_stay.html", "http://dailym.ai/1LbSLvL"], "published": "2015-08-15T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T01:24:22.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
