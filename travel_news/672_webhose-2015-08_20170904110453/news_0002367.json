During the fiscal year 2014-2015 (July 2014 to June 2015), a total of 1,113 events were held at the HKCEC, including 111 exhibitions and 38 conferences along with hundreds of corporate meetings, banquets and entertainment events. The total attendees at these 1,113 events combined with diners at the HKCEC’s seven restaurants was almost 6.4 million people, including visitors from around the world, and broke the HKCEC’s attendance record. \nSeven of the year’s 111 exhibitions were new at the HKCEC. They included industries as diverse as foreign exchange service, natural and organic products, photo imaging and camera, vegetarian food and rail. The other 104 exhibitions were recurrent events, which continued as the backbone of the HKCEC’s exhibition portfolio. In the reporting year, 15 of the recurrent exhibitions recorded double-digit growth in terms of gross exhibition space compared with their previous editions. Conference business remained strong. Among the 38 conferences held at the HKCEC, 31 were international and 12 were new to the venue, covering different subjects including medical science, yoga, banking, and electrical and electronics engineering. The strong attendance is especially positive in light of the “Occupy Central” movement that took place in Hong Kong during the peak trade fair season in October and November 2014. Despite the HKCEC being nearby the affected area, its management and staff worked closely with exhibition organisers to enable all trade exhibitions at the HKCEC to proceed uninterrupted. This achievement, in face of difficult external circumstances, clearly demonstrates the solid foundation of Hong Kong’s exhibition industry. Underlining Hong Kong’s successes as the leading city of international exhibitions in Asia are many factors, one of which is the responsiveness and flexibility of the team behind the HKCEC to cope with challenges as they emerge. Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (Management) Limited (“HML”) is the professional private management company responsible for the management and daily operation of the HKCEC. HML Managing Director Ms Monica Lee-Müller remarked, “We take pride in attracting organisers from around the world to Hong Kong, and providing quality services for event attendees.” “At HML, we are targeting more upmarket events and niche topics, like auction events, art exhibitions and luxury product shows,” she comments. “Our advanced facilities, talents and experience allow us to tap the up and emerging markets. Event attendees of these markets look for a total experience and quality, such as food and beverage, technology and customer service etc.” “We strive for providing innovative solutions for people to meet. I am delighted that event organisers clearly recognise our commitment to enhancing HKCEC’s competitiveness through our continuous investment in new technologies, new equipment, and new talent.” Related articles National Railway Museum launches Leaves on the Line campaign The National Railway Museum in York is launching a campaign to celebrate the great English heritage and tradition of afternoon tea.
