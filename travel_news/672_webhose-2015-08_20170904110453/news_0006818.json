With a powerful V8, sophisticated 4WD chassis and seating for eight, the Lexus LX 570 remains one of the few luxury utility vehicles that combine sumptuous luxury with true off-road capability. Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7599251-lexus-pebble-beach-concours-2015/ Lexus left barely any surface of the LX 570 untouched in a sweeping upgrade for 2016, with only door panels carried over from 2015. The restyled front end wears an even bolder rendition of the Lexus signature spindle grille, framed by elegant satin chrome trim and complemented by distinctive new standard LED headlights, turn signals and fog lights. The LX 570 design makeover gives it new 20-inch split 10-spoke wheels, and new available 21-inch 10-spoke wheels. The taillights and rear bumper also get a new look. The upgrades for 2016 go beyond skin-deep. An eight-speed automatic transmission replaces the former six-speed for enhanced performance and efficiency. New Drive Mode Select, as used in other Lexus vehicles, allows the LX 570 driver to tailor powertrain and suspension responses by using a dial on the console. The system also controls responses of the Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS), which continually adjusts shock absorber damping rates while driving, helping to ensure optimal comfort even as the road surface changes. Modes include ECO, which adjusts powertrain responses and air conditioning to prioritize fuel-efficient driving; COMFORT mode optimizes AVS damping to help deliver the smoothest ride possible; SPORT S mode dials up powertrain response and dials down power steering assist to yield a sportier driving feel, and, to that, SPORT S+ mode adds firmer damping control from AVS to prioritize handling agility. 1 of 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T10:37:33.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
