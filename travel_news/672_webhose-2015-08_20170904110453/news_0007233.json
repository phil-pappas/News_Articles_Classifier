It is a river cave located between Satun and Trang provinces in the South, about 900km from Bangkok. \nThe cave has been promoted as a new tourist destination by the Tambon Administrative Organisation (TAO) of Thung Wa. It has a river called Wang Kluay running through and flowing to mangrove forest and the sea. Visitors can ride a kayak along the river 4km inside the cave to find the spot where there are 1.8 million-year-old fossils of the Stegodon, a proboscidean with a physical resemblance to present-day elephants. \n\"The route is the longest cave journey in Thailand,\" said TAO Chief Narongrit Thongprue. The entrance is in Ban Khiriwong, Thung Wa district of Satun. The TAO has built a rest area, public toilets and elephant sculptures together with a large sign at the front of the entrance. \nAccording to Narongrit, the Stegodon fossil was found seven years ago by three locals living near the cave. Like other people in Thung Wa, they often went inside the cave to fish for giant river prawns. But one day during the dry season in April 2008, one of them accidentally found a strange shaped rock with eight ridges on the surface. \nHe picked it up and took it back home, but a couple of weeks later he decided to offer the specimen to TAO of Thung Wa. The dark brown rock was kept at Thung Wa police station. \nNews spread that the rock might be a fossil. An expert team went in to verify the object. What they found became the remarkable history of Satun. The item was indeed the fossil of a Stegodon's jaw and teeth. It was identified as the second and third molars of the lower right jaw. The fossil size is 44cm in length and 16cm in height and weighs 5.3kg. Based on the specimen, this Stegodon could have been about 4m high. Stegodon was a large ancient elephant that roamed Asia and lived from 2.5 million years to 11,700 years ago. \nAfter the fossil was identified, a discovery team from local authorities started to explore the cave. They also found other fossils of other ancient animals such as elephas (the origin of the Asian elephant), nautiloid (ancient squid), ammonoids (squidlike creatures with coil-shaped shells), trilobite (distant relatives of horseshoe crabs) and a jaw with teeth of a gandatherium (ancient rhino). \nSince the Stegodon fossil was found, the cave was officially renamed from Wang Kluay to the present name. Some locals call the cave by its short name \"Tham Le\", meaning cave which links to the sea. \n\"Satun is the only province in the South that a Stegodon's fossil was found,\" said Narongrit. \nTo make the locals proud of the remarkable site, TAO of Thung Wa introduced the kayak tour through the cave two years ago. \nBefore exploring the cave, visitors are required to wear a life jacket and a helmet for safety. Each kayak can carry two passengers. As visitors, my friends and I did not have to paddle the kayaks ourselves. Trained locals do this and act as guides. \nMy guide Bang Air, who normally works at a rubber plantation if there are no visitors, has paddled kayaks for tourists since the project started. When we sat properly on the kayak, we gave him the signal to go. Our kayak slowly moved inside the cave. The ceiling of the cave is high and the temperature cooler than the outside. Sometimes water fell from above and wet our cameras. Many parts of the cave wall have running water which look like small waterfalls. \n\"Above the cave is the forest. But none of us have ever climbed to the top of the mountain as the cliff is very steep,\" he said. \nAlmost an hour later, we reached the middle of the cave, identified by a T-junction. The left led us to the exit and the right was the dead end, said my guide, adding that this area was where the Stegodon fossil was found. \nHe and his friends always come to the cave during dry season for prawns. He can catch six or seven of them plus fish for his family within a couple of hours. But he never knew that there was a fossil there. \n\"I never come across any fossil. Even if I had found one, I wouldn't have known that it was fossil,\" he said and laughed. \nWhen our kayak reached about three-quarters through the route, Bang Air told us to notice some tree roots growing near the cave wall. \n\"They are seedlings of mangrove trees. It indicates that seawater can reach to this area when it is high tide,\" he said. \nThe seedlings do not have leaves as there is no sunshine inside the cave. When we turned off all the lights, the cave was totally dark. I couldn't even see my hands. \nWhen we were about to reach the other end of the cave, we spotted bats and after a short while we saw light from the end of the tunnel. Bang Air happily told us the cave exit has a heart-like shape which he said could be a romantic moment for lovers to take pictures of themselves, especially during Valentine's Day. \nTham Le Stegodon can be visited any time of year even during the rainy season, except when it rains heavily as the river may flow too fast. \nDuring the dry season touring the cave can add adventure to those who are young at heart. But sitting for two hours in the kayak can result in leg or back pain for some people. Sometimes the kayak needs to be carried. The activity is popular among youths and the tour can last four hours. \nAfter finishing the cave tour, the TAO chief advised us to visit Thung Wa Ancient Elephant Museum where visitors can observe various types of fossil found in Satun, including the Stegodon's jaw. The compact museum also exhibits the history of Thai elephants. \n\"Thung Wa has many things to offer. We hope that visitors will not only have fun, but gain more knowledge about the geological sites of Satun,\" said Narongrit. \nStegodon models. \nFossils and an ammonoid model. \nFossil of a Stegodon's jaw. \nWang Kluay River flows between Trang and Satun provinces.
