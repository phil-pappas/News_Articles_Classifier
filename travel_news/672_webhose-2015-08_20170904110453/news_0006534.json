It was sharp, but welcome, because all year we’ve been checking the brambles’ progress from bud to flower, watching the berries changing from green to black, and charting the growing year. There’s also the cheeky thrill of finding food for free, something probably lost on most four-year-olds, but alive and kicking in even the most unadventurous forager. Blackberries are starting to ripen (Alamy) Garden writer Alys Fowler is queen of foragers. Where others see weeds, she sees food, and she believes there’s bounty closer to home than you think. All you need is the confidence to identify, pick and eat, and perhaps a really good book to point you in the right direction. Her latest, The Thrifty Forager: Living Off Your Local Landscape, is just that. • Foraging: how to find wild mushrooms in London A helpful mixture of guide, rule book and recipe book, the amateur forager will be encouraged by inspirational case studies: by Incredible Edible Todmorden in Devon, a whole rural community growing fruit and veg on previously unused public land from graveyards to road islands; by Los Angeles’ Fallen Fruit project which maps and plants fruit trees in the urban environment; and by Stephen Barstow, academic and author of Around the World in Eighty Plants, who lives in Norway and has eaten his way through 15,000 or so plants. • Britain's best places for foraging Foraging is always assumed to be a countryside passion, but Fowler, who lives in Birmingham, is on a mission to encourage us all to look for food in unexpected places. She urges us to search in wild parks, on canal and riverside pathways, in allotments and churchyards, in car parks and on derelict ground. All the familiar worries are dealt with competently, such as pollution: foraged food is no dirtier than supermarket food; trespass: ask permission before picking wherever possible; and poisons: keep her guide in your backpack to consult. However, it’s the recipe section that I love best. Alys Fowler suggests searching alongside canals and in wild parks for food (Simon Wheeler) As Fowler says, “It’s not a book about eating weird things. I have been ruthless about taste.” Encouraged by her example, I tried my spectacular blue mahonia berries in a peanut butter sandwich (they were sour – but then I realised the recipe was for mahonia berry jelly, so I made some quick fridge jam and it was delicious). • Urban foraging: what foods can you find growing in cities? I also tried fat hen (tasteless) and hairy bittercress leaves (spicy) in my salad for lunch; and, finally, damsons in the tart, which both grandson Ludo and I loved. Damsons are the perfect addition to any fruity pudding (Jay Williams) Fowler learnt most of her foraging from her mother. Did she have cautionary tales that I could pass on to Ludo, who is fascinated by the toxic lords and ladies and honeysuckle berries that grow next to the blackberries? Fowler says her mother used to march about the garden, shouting “You will die” at the sight of non-edibles, but she reminds me “most poisonous things taste awful. We should rely on our instincts, on our other senses and ask yourself, 'Does it smell nice?’ ” For small children, I prefer to tell them to always ask before eating anything they find wherever it’s growing. • Grow damsons for luscious jams and moreish brandy I also asked Fowler for her favourite foraged meal at this time of the year. She suggested a walnut pesto (culled from a secret tree in a housing estate near her home) eaten with Japanese noodles; then maybe a salad of bittercress, wild rocket, herb burnet and deadnettle leaves; followed by a cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera) tart. We can all share in nature’s bounty.
