But in recent years, with tickets capped and crowds approaching 65,000, it's losing sight of those founding principles. \nEspecially, the \"radical self-reliance\" bit, summed up best here by a team making US$3745 (NZ$5697) for each of the 50 air-conditioned, fitted containers they hire to wealthy techies who want to be able to call themselves \"Burners\". \nBut if you missed out on a ticket, and still want to spend US$3745, you could probably get to Amsterdam, where there's another way to get that sun, and an alien planet vibe. \nIt's called UrbanCampsite, and it's an art installation that occurs every year in a different location around Amsterdam. \nThis year, it's actually in Amsterdam, but in very un-Amsterdam place. \nAbout 6km east of the CBD lies IJburg, a neighbourhood still under construction on a group of artificial islands being raised from the bed of the IJ Lake. \nIt's a controversial project, mainly due to environmental concerns, and while it was originally meant to house 350,000 people, its 10 islands will eventually be home to 45,000 residents. Ad Feedback \nCentrumeiland (Centre island), has a large empty stretch of sand waiting for houses. \nLarge enough so an entire temporary community can be set up and still maintain some sort of isolated vibe. \nExcellently, you can book one of the bizarre pods through Airbnb, for as little as €85 (NZ$144) per night. Here's what you get: \nUrbancampsite has been here since June 1, and has another three weeks left to run on its \"installation\". \nUniverse 7 – you can turn the house with the sun!

Photo: Airbnb/Urbancampsite \nDo we need to explain why? \nPhoto: Airbnb/Urbancampsite \nAll of the installations have a bed and the campsite has toiletries and cooking facilities. \nBut you have to bring your own towels and toiletries. (There's that radical self-reliance.) \nTribal Toilet Tower by Atelier van Lieshout (and showers). Photo: Airbnb/Urbancampsite \nOK, so you get coffee in the morning and there's a supermarket a five-minute walk away. \nAnd you can even work on-site by booking use of the KantoorKaravan during the day. They're calling that option a \"workation\". \nPhoto: Urbancampsite \nBut the campsite is beautiful, and there are also lots of workshops and performances. \nSuperfire.

You can check them all out on Urbancampsite's web site and book them through Airbnb. \nSolid Family. Photo: Airbnb/Urbancampsite \nCarved from wood.
