I ignored the overhead nets that caught many flung objects. \nHalfway around, I thought \"Oh, bad, bad idea,\" but I held onto the phone through my pants leg for the rest of the trip, promising the coaster gods that I'd never do that again. \nCoaster gods said \"Ha!\" \nWe pulled back into the station, I stood up, and the phone was gone. My denial was so deep, I thought with certainty that the phone would be resting in ride vehicle seats. After all, I was holding on to it. Nope. \nI walked around to see if we could see the phone resting peacefully on a grassy knoll beneath the tracks. The ringer was on mute, so calling myself was out. And then it started to rain. \nSo my deal with the coaster gods officially was off, but these days my smartphone goes into the locker 99 percent of the time. Universal has made that a requirement for the Hulk, installing a metal detector to rat out the overly optimistic cargo-shorts types. \nMoving on up \nThe best times are when you're seated next to a Hulk virgin. Everyone is strapped in, and the train moves slowly up the lift hill. Right now, I must say \"Spoiler alert.\" \nI like to chat up the newbies on the way up. \"Say, have you ever been on this before? Are you enjoying the park?\" \nI use soothing tones until, with little warning, Hulk thrusts forward, upward, onward. You can't see this from the ground, so the startled rookie cusses. It's a good time. \nP.S. The official Universal announcement said the version of Hulk will get \"enhancements to its storyline, ride vehicles and overall experience.\" I have no official clues, but I do have two wishes: New costumes for team members (death to electric-lemon ensembles) … and floorless ride vehicles? \nA ranger can dream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:55:55.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
