The 1950s may be recalled for many now-quaint things, but it was also a decade with antecedents for our current technological pursuits. On this date in 1955, William G. Cobb of the General Motors Corporation demonstrated the world's first solar-powered car. This vehicle didn't take the world by storm because it was a model a mere 15 inches long. The first solar powered car that could actually be driven was unveiled in 1962; a 1912 Baker electric car was fitted with nearly 11,000 individual solar cells on the roof to power the vehicle. Now, more than 50 years on, a fully practical solar-powered car remains a goal, but manufacturing automobiles, mostly powered by internal combustion, is a nearly $110 billion a year business in the U.S. Profile America is in its 19 th year as a public service of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSources: Kane's Famous First Facts, 5457\n1962 version: http://www.automostory.com/first-solar-car.htm\nAutomobile manufacturing/NAICS 336111: http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ASM_2013_31VS101&prodType=table\nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
