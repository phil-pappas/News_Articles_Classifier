The Mayor of London acknowledged he risks being eclipsed by “Tory thrusters” by the time David Cameron steps down. Mr Cameron has said he intends to serve a full five years, until 2020, and there is speculation he may attempt to govern for longer if the Labour Party descends to turmoil. In an interview with Der Spiegel, the German magazine, Mr Johnson invited comparisons to Sir Winston Churchill, saying that the public like a \"Falstaff character\". Mr Johnson was regarded as a favourite to succeed Mr Cameron due to his strong popularity ratings, but he has suffered a rocky return to Parliament, with claims from rivals that he is poorly prepared for Cabinet meetings. Attention has shifted to Mr Cameron’s deputy, George Osborne, as well as young figures such as Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, and Elizabeth Truss, the Environment Secretary. Asked if he would like to succeed Mr Cameron, Mr Johnson, 51, said: “Thankfully, there's not going to be a vacancy until late 2018, if not later. By that stage, you know, a new generation of Tory thrusters will be sprouting like dragons' teeth. So the torch has been passed.” However, he added: “Mind you, Churchill was 65 when he became Prime Minister.” The Mayor suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Theresa May earlier this year when she ruled that three German-built watercannon that he bought for £200,000 in the wake of the London riots would not be used. He said it was a “brilliant deal”, and indicated that Mrs May’s decision could be reversed. “These machines are perfectly usable. If there's a riot, we'll use them,” he said. Mr Johnson was photographed last year holding a Kalashnikov rifle in Kurdistan, which invited comparisons to a famous portrait of Churchill holding a Thomson machine gun. He said: “It was done to show solidarity with the Kurdish Peshmerga at the beginning of the year. All the experts say that I'm holding the gun completely wrong, there are no bullets in it. I don't regret the picture, because I hate the Islamic State.” Like Mr Johnson, Sir Winston spent years in the political wilderness and was a prolific writer and bon viveur. “He certainly understood that the British like an element of Falstaff in their leaders,” Mr Johnson said, referring to Shakespeare's heavy-drinking buffoon. “The idea of the amateur. Someone, who looks like he is willing to make jokes.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T02:10:03.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
