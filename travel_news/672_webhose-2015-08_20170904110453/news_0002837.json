All proceeds raised from the sale of these bags will be channeled to Biji-Biji Initiative. \n\nThis programme marks the first Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activity undertaken by MACEOS. \n\nVincent Lim, president of MACEOS and president of C.I.S Network, the joint organiser of ARCHIDEX, said: “Recycling advertising banners into something artistic and wholly practical is the first step we are taking towards creating a more environmentally friendly events industry.” \n\nMatthieu Mertens - Partner, Head of Systems & Electronics, Biji-Biji Initiative, said: “These banner tote bags that we make from discarded advertising tarpaulin offer a creative solution for the global waste problem and each (will have its) own quirky design. These banners have been given a second life, saving them from ending up in the landfill. \n\n“There are countless creative ways we can up-cycle fashionable and useful everyday objects from discarded items. All that’s required is an open mind and a willingness to look at waste from a different perspective.” \n\nAt the same time, MACEOS is calling for industry partners including professional conventions and exhibitions organisers, venue owners and operators as well as contractors, to be committed towards reducing carbon footprint during the staging of business and leisure events. An official Green Events logo will be accorded to events that meet the criteria set by MACEOS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T07:30:08.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
