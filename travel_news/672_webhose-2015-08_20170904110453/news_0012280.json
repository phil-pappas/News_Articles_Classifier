You could put a hold on those granny undies though; I was going to be a successful career woman, living out my dream in the city of dreams. Landing a London job: How did you do it? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nIt took all of two weeks for the shine to wear off. Or more accurately, wash off. \nPounding the pavement during winter rainstorms and ticking off various recruiters across town, in heels no less, did little to enamour me of London. \nOn one particularly gloomy day, after getting caught in yet another rain storm, I arrived at a recruitment appointment only to find my CVs were a pile of wet mush and my mascara was have an identity crisis and imitating foundation. It goes without saying, I had hit a new low. \nI arrived in London one year after graduating, searching for a career without a great deal of experience or a strong vocation - which left me in the minority. \nIt can be hard to get your first foot on London's corporate ladder, but persistence pays off. PHOTO: ABIGAIL DRANE \nI have many friends who graduated and moved straight over to nanny or work in a pub, party, conquer the Waitangi Day pub crawl, travel and squeeze the life out of London on a two-year visa, before going back to 'pursue a career'. Ad Feedback \nSimilarly, I have friends who have spent years gaining work experience in New Zealand, before making an advantageous career move to London. They are gaining long stay visas, are more financially stable, and even partake in mini-breaks (just like Daniel Cleaver and Bridget Jones, sigh). \nThe latter group have, for the most part, landed jobs relatively easily in London, in a wide range of sectors. I currently live with two health professionals who are on significantly increased salaries, and working in specialisms that New Zealand does not provide, right off the bat. \nIt was just that 'experience', or lack thereof, that got the mushy remains of my CV thrown back in my face on that wintry day. \nYet days later, my very own fairy godmother appeared in the form of a brutally honest recruiter - not quite what I had in mind - who stripped my CV, pulled out my experience, which had been hiding there all along, and packaged it up in a nice little bundle. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T03:21:51.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
