The international outrage over the killing of Cecil the lion by a Minnesota dentist is prompting changes on several airlines that will make it more difficult for big-game hunters to bring their trophies home. Delta Air Lines Inc. on Monday joined several other major airlines in banning hunting trophies from its planes. Atlanta-based Delta (NYSE: DAL) is the dominant carrier at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and the only U.S. airline that flies direct routes to Africa. The worldwide Delta ban specifically includes lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies. \"Prior to this ban, Delta's strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species. Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments,\" Delta said in a statement Monday. Delta joins the likes of British Airlines and Lufthansa in banning the trophies from its cargo holds, The New York Times reports. Several other major airlines including KLM are also weighing similar prohibitions. \nWant Minneapolis / St. Paul Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:01:29.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
