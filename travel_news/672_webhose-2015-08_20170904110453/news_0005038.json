In most instances this includes insurance, break down cover and maybe even a certain amount of kilometres that you can enjoy completely free. But at the same time, there are things that can be added to your final bill, which can leave you shocked when you return the car expecting to pay nothing and then finding out your travel budget hasn't gone far enough. \nThe first tip to ensure you rent a car at a cheap price is to book in advance. Pre-booking your vehicle before you leave for holiday can provide you with a discounted rate, much cheaper than if you were to book a car at the airport on arrival. Remember that the further in advance you book, often the cheaper the price will be. If you are working to a tight travel budget, but you still want to enjoy the conveniences that car rental provides, then book from home weeks before your travel date to secure the best prices and deals, helping your travel budget go that little bit further. \nCheck to ensure that the company you have chosen to rent a car from offers insurance and that it is included in the price. It's also worthwhile identifying what the excess is in the event that you do have an accident. Most insurance companies can provide you with comprehensive insurance, putting your mind at ease. Remember when you hire a vehicle it is the same as if you owned the vehicle, if you have an accident, then you are liable to pay an excess for the repairs or replacement of the vehicle. Ensure that you know exactly if insurance is included and what the excess is before booking. \nIn addition to this, experts recommend that you go around the vehicle when it's delivered to you and make note of all scratches, marks and dents both inside and out. It's advisable to take photographs and get the person delivering it to you to make note of any marks. This way when you return the vehicle, should the company try and blame you for these scratches and marks, you can prove to them that they were there when you took possession of the vehicle. This can save you considerably. If you cannot prove that these marks were not you're doing, you could be held liable. \nFurther, you will want to check on all fees and inclusions in the rental price. Some companies include a host of benefits to their car rental price, pushing up the daily rate. Others offer you a bare bone package, with extras being charged for. Knowing the hidden charges and fees can help you budget accordingly and ensure that you rent a car at the cheapest possible price to meet your needs and budget. \nConsider using an independent company over the international rental companies. The independent companies can often offer you better deals, a great selection and better prices. In addition to this, you find that international rent a car companies only accept credit card payments, which isn't practical if you don't have a credit card or you don't want to pay high fees if you are travelling from overseas. Independent companies often enable you to pay cash, internet transfer or debit card payments, helping you rent a car and not break the bank in the process. : Xtreme Car Rental is a well-established car rental company which has been operating in South Africa since 2002.
