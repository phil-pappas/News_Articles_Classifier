After a pilot program that covered five airlines in a dozen cities back in 2002, the agency moved its efforts for a trusted traveler program to the private sector in 2005, with operators including Clear (the largest, with 22 airports), FLO, rtGo and Preferred Traveler.\nClear shut down abruptly on June 22, 2009, after being unable to make arrangements with its creditors. The company got back into the verified traveler business in May 2010, and is now operating in 12 U.S. airports. For $179 a year, travelers get a biometric card that they can use at a separate security checkpoint entrance.\nSo the TSA decided to get into the trusted traveler business. PreCheck, an expedited screening program, began as a pilot program in October 2011. It covered frequent flyers of 11 airlines, along with members of Customs and Border Protection’s Global Entry , NEXUS , and SENTRI programs and active duty members of the U.S. military to get expedited screening for domestic and select international flights. Since then, the program has expanded to all airlines at 156 airports.\nTo apply travelers, who must be a U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident, pay a non-refundable $85 fee. Applicants must visit an application center to provide biographic information that includes name, date of birth and address.\nThey will also be fingerprinted and will be required to provide valid required identity and citizenship/immigration documentation, including a U.S. passport or a driver’s license and birth certificate. Other acceptable identification includes: an unexpired Enhanced Tribal Card; an unexpired Free and Secure Trade Card; an unexpired U.S. Enhanced Driver’s License Enhanced Identification Card; a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card); an unexpired Foreign Passport and immigrant visa with I-551 annotation of “Upon Endorsement Serves as Temporary I-551 Evidencing Permanent Residence of 1 Year;” or an unexpired Re-entry Permit (I-327).\nTo find the nearest application center, go to the TSA PreCheck appointment web page to make an appointment or call the Universal Enrollment Call Center at 1-855-DHS-UES1 (1-855-347-8371). Walk-ins are also allowed at most application centers, but wait times may be longer. After two or three weeks, approved applicants will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN) via U.S. mail. The KTN is valid for five years.\nTo use a PreCheck line, travelers put their KTN in the ‘Known Traveler Number’ field when booking flights on participating airlines. The KTN also can be added when booking reservations online via a participating airline website, via phone call to the airline reservation center, or with the travel management company making reservations. It can also be entered in participating airline frequent flyer profiles, where it will be stored for future reservations.\nUnder PreCheck, low-risk travelers may leave on their shoes, light outerwear and belt, keep their laptop in its case and their 3-1-1 compliant liquids and gels bag in a carry-on in dedicated screening lanes. Dedicated PreCheck lanes are now available in 156 U.S. airports . Members of the Global Entry, NEXUS or SENTRI programs are automatically enrolled in TSA’s PreCheck program.\nBut TSA emphasizes that it will continue to use random and unpredictable security measures both seen and unseen throughout the airport. All travelers will be screened, and no individual will be guaranteed expedited screening.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Please follow my travel-related magazines on Flipboard: Best of About Travel , a joint curation venture with my fellow About Travel Experts; and Travel-Go!
