We are delighted that the NYMR has not only restored the gantry to its former glory but also brought it back into operational use at Grosmont. This project is a testament to the teams involved and great example of how we can work together as an industry to protect our heritage whilst continuing to grow and modernise the railway for passengers.”\nPhilip Benham added: “The gantry has given us the ability to improve our operation at Grosmont and was vital for the expansion of our Whitby services. Following full restoration, it has been integrated into our signalling at Grosmont and is controlling trains during this summer season including, most appropriately, the signalling of trains onto Network Rail. I want to thank our team of volunteers and Network Rail for their hard work to protect this important part of the railway skyline.”\nThe gantry is a listed structure so its removal needed to be sensitively handled. Tony Rivero, town planning manager at Network Rail explained; “Planning authorities are, understandably, very keen to see listed structures retained in an environment which reflects their original purpose. This project has allowed us to carry out the improvements we needed on the main line whilst still finding a useful, not to mention, beautiful, new surrounding for the gantry. It’s a real win-win for everyone involved.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:42:35.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
