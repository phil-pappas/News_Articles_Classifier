They want to figure out how they can make the region a home away from home, not just by enjoying the beach, but also volunteering for an hour or helping a school - whether by contributing towards the cost of a computer or a smart board,\" said Archer-Cunningham, who specializes in community and organizational development, philanthropy, and social entrepreneurship. \nArcher-Cunningham believes that the hospitality industry, especially hotels, should be encouraged to establish strategic partnerships with local and regional media to increase awareness of the social and philanthropic needs within the destination. \"We need broad communications channels so that people traveling to the Caribbean - either single or multiple destinations - receive the information and access they need to make decisions about how they can contribute their time, dollars and energy,\" she commented. \nAccording to Carrie Kahn, National Public Radio's international correspondent, more than 1.6 million volunteer tourists are spending about US $2 billion each year. \nArcher-Cunningham's firm Global Ase facilitates social transformation by creating strong relationships between the people who want to help and people who need help.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:59:34.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
