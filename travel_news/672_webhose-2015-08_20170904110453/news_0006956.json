Railway is the lifeline of the country. Employees are working round the clock across the country,” Mishra said.\nHe, however, said servicemen in defence forces should get OROP but the same principle should also be applicable to Railways.\n“Our brothers in defence should get it as soon as possible. But at the same time we should also not be ignored,” AIRF leader said.\nExpressing disappointment over Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s Red Fort speech, Mishra said “PM should have offered something concrete on the OROP issue. Though there were expectations for an announcement on the issue, nothing happened.”\nPM, in his Independence day speech, said in-principle the government has accepted the demand for OROP but it is a long pending issues, and discussions are underway and in the last stages.\nTaking on lawmakers, he said, “MPs are increasing their salaries whenever they want to increase. They even get full pension irrespective of their term or attendance.”\n 15, 2015 6:41 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:24:15.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
