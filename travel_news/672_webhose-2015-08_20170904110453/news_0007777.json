She asks: What are your five top business tips? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: 1. Find something you will love doing, day in, day out. Starting a business is hard work and will take up many hours. You can only hope to give this level of commitment if it is something you really want to do. Choose something you can get really excited about. 2. But make sure, too, that you choose a product or service that people will actually want to buy. Do thorough research first and make sure you really have identified a gap in the market. If there aren’t enough people who want to buy what you are selling, then you don’t have a business. 3. Act like a proper business right from the start. Many first-time entrepreneurs almost apologise for starting a business and act as if it is just something they are doing as a hobby, especially if they run it from home. But if you don’t take your business seriously then no-one else will – not customers, suppliers or investors. 4. Get your numbers right. Too many small businesses price their products or services too low and then wonder why they can’t make any money. Build in a good profit margin – and don’t forget to include your labour costs. Even if you are not paying yourself a salary, one day you will need to pay someone else to do your job. 5. Keep it simple. Your business idea does not have to be complicated. Many of the most successful businesses have incredibly simple ideas; it’s just they do them better than anyone else. Business expert Lara Morgan of companyshortcuts.com adds: 1. You cannot grow a scaleable business alone – you need to build a culture based on values that excite you and your team. A mission statement of what makes you better and different, and a vision that gives people clear goals will allow them to play their part in the process. Then learn to delegate, trust others will do a good job and utilise their skillsets. 2. Communicating more is always better than not communicating enough. Communicating repeatedly the same message about the values of your business is imperative to success, and that means walking the walk as well as talking the talk. 3. Never distance yourself so far from the financial performance of the company that you do not have your fingers on the pulse of where the cash is and whether it's being best utilised for higher return on investment. 4. Hire the most talented people you can find, then expect, encourage and empower them to perform. Build working environments that suit people’s lives - the flexibility will allow them to perform to the best of their abilities, feel trusted and valued and, as a result, be paid back in triplicate. 5. Keep learning and never stand still in this regard. Don't let your team get complacent, either - build an expectation that the only constant is change. • One great business tip is to get the right company car, financed in the best way.
