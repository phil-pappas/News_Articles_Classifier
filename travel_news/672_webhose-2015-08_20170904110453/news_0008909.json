SYDNEY, July 31 — Sydney is well known for its hip cafes, magnificent landmarks and cool markets. However, there’s so much more to this lively city as you will discover when you take a self-drive holiday to explore Sydney’s surrounds. \nBlue mountains \nThe first stop was the Blue Mountains, a 90-minute drive from Sydney Airport. On the way there, my partner and I stopped at Featherdale Wildlife Park, which is home to a variety of Australian native animals and birds, such as the barking owl, dingo and saltwater crocodile. \nFor AUD$1 (RM2.80), you can feed the kangaroos, wallabies and emus as they wander around in an enclosed area. Or get up close to koalas for a cuddle at the Koala Sanctuary. \nAfter that, it was on to the Blue Mountains. The best place to check out the World-Heritage-listed site is at Scenic World. Here, you can explore the area in a variety of ways. \nBe mesmerised by the beauty of the Blue Mountains. — TODAY pic The Scenic Cableway is a steep aerial cable car ride that descends 545m into Jamison Valley and provides a panoramic view of the area. \nYou can also take a stroll through the Jurassic rainforest via the 2.4km Scenic Walkway. \nFor amazing views of Katoomba Falls, the Three Sisters and Jamison Valley, the Scenic Skyway suspends you 270m above the ancient ravine and glides 720m between cliff tops. It also has a glass floor where you can view the rainforest canopy below. \nAt Blue Mountains, be sure to visit Katoomba Town and Leura Mall. Lining the streets are dozens of charming cafes, galleries and boutiques selling everything from books to antiques. \nPort Stephens \nNext up is Port Stephens, located in the Hunter Region of New South Wales. With smooth traffic and good music, the four-hour drive from Blue Mountains didn’t feel long. \nCuddle a koala at Featherdale Wildlife Park. — TODAY pic Port Stephens is known for its crystal-clear waters, pristine beaches and yummy seafood. There’s a lot to do here, such as sand boarding and quad-bike riding. \nSince Port Stephens is home to more than 140 bottlenose dolphins, go dolphin-watching to see if you can catch sight of these graceful, wild mammals. Travelling to Port Stephens from May to November? Opt for a whale-watching cruise to see the migrating humpback whales. \nCentral Coast \nOn the way from Port Stephens to the Central Coast, stop by the Australian Shark & Ray Centre in Bobs Farm. This small, indoor aquarium features pools of various sharks and stingrays. You can get into the water with the friendly creatures or stand at the sides to touch and feed them. \nThe Central Coast is nestled on the coast north of Sydney and comprises six precincts. As I wanted to see the pelicans, I headed to The Entrance precinct. Pelican feeding is a popular activity that takes place at The Entrance waterfront daily. \nGet up close to wild pelicans at The Entrance on Central Coast. — TODAY pic This activity began more than 20 years ago when staff from a local fish shop started feeding scraps to wild pelicans every day. Over time, flocks of the water birds turned up for feeding and a platform, Pelican Plaza, was eventually built for them. \nWhile the volunteers feed the pelicans, they also educate the public about the birds. During this time, they also check the pelicans and ensure they don’t have any hooks and lines tangled up in their gullets and wings. \nThe road trip was a pleasant way to experience Sydney’s surrounds. Relish the slow pace and took our time to explore the various towns and its attractions. \nEnjoy the picturesque view of the yachts at sea against the sunset at Port Stephens. — TODAY  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:00:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
