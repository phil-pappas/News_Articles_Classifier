(Pratham Gokhale/HT photo) \nWhen Mumbai girl Sheetal Darda got married and moved to Aurangabad, she was keen to invest in art but was unable to find a suitable gallery or art space in the city. She found it surprising since a lot of artists and art students visited Aurangabad to sketch the Ajanta and Ellora caves. \nRealising that there was a wealth of untapped talent, she started Shlok, a platform for upcoming artists to showcase their work. It has been seven years since. After hosting 18 exhibitions in Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nashik, Darda is finally hosting Shlok’s first exhibition in Mumbai. \nTitled Rethinking the Regional, it’s an ambitious project spanning a century of artworks (from 1900 to 2000), and showcasing paintings and installations by 175 artists from across Maharashtra.

We have shown in smaller towns where there are few galleries and little awareness of art,” says Darda. \nAt the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), the exhibition presents art from regions like Konkan, Marathwada, Khandesh and Vidarbha, alongside works from Mumbai and Pune. The highlights include paintings by SH Raza, works dating back to 1890 by Abalal Rehman, and paintings by acclaimed artists like B Prabha, Shivaji Tupe, and MV Dhurandhar. \nIt took Darda 18 months from conceptualising the exhibition to executing it, especially since it involved sourcing works from collectors, museums and families. “It took time getting permissions and approvals. We had to approach around 30 museums and trusts, as well as art institutes and studios like the Abhinav Kala Mahavidyalaya in Pune, the Nagpur Museum and Nashik Kala Niketan,” Darda says.

The art community was also helpful, so if one person learned something, they taught others,” observes Darda. She cites the example of artist Bhaiyaji Goswami, who was a friend of SH Raza and painted with him but was never in the limelight. \nThe show also features letters written by artists, photographs, and books pertaining to regional art. \nDarda is now planning to document the show and screen the recordings in art colleges across Maharashtra.
