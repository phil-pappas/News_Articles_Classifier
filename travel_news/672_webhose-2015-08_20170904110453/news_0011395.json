Travelers who venture into town can find duty-free shops and a crafts market on Harbour Street and a few historic sites around Sam Sharpe Square, named for the leader of a failed slave resort who was hanged here in 1832. \nThe town’s “Hip Strip” -- on Gloucester Avenue -- has nightclubs and a casino; the local Margaritaville restaurant has a fun water play area and slide that will dump you into the Caribbean (put your drink down first). \nLess adventurous tourists stick to the hotel district along Doctor’s Cave Beach or the outlying resorts along the local shoreline. Just outside Montego Bay is Rose Hall, home to the Great House of the same name that’s reputed to be haunted; the Rose Hall Beach Club is the place to go for watersports, and the Ritz-Carlton and other big resorts are located in this area. \nThe Montego Bay area also is home to some of the best golf courses in Jamaica and, in fact, the world. \nMontego Bay is located on the northwest coast of Jamaica and is served by nearby Sangster International Airport. It also has a cruise port that can accommodate the largest cruise ships in the world.
