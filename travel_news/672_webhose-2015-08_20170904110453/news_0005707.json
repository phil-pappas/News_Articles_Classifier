We always seem to say “it’s been a funny year weather‑wise”, but my colleague and keen gardener Peter Gibbs is a BBC weatherman so he scrutinises the weather more than most. He makes the point that there have been massive variations across the country this year. Bunny Guinness at work in her veg plot During the first half of July the eastern parts of England have been unusually dry, whereas eastern Scotland and Northern Ireland have been unusually wet. For gardeners in the east, this paltry rainfall combined with a dry June has caused problems, such as my garlic becoming stressed and bolting. •Gardening in the rain: advice and tips Peter adds that when it is dry in high summer the deficit is exaggerated by the high evaporation rate – his pond, for example, has dropped by 1ft and some of his perennials are wilting. He did, however, reassure me by saying that it was just surface water we are short of and that groundwater levels are still good, so hopefully my spring (and sole water supply) will continue to flow. Pippa Greenwood, my colleague from Gardeners’ Question Time, runs a mail order vegetable plant business from Hampshire and so is well informed on how crops are doing around the country. She said that even her mature, cropping courgette plants have started to wilt on sunny days. •Where to buy the best-value vegetable seeds I, too, have had several failures. While my early 'Douce Provence’ peas, sown last autumn, got their roots down and cropped well without watering, my spring-sown 'Lord Leicester’, which should produce peas over a long period, went straw coloured too early. With hindsight, I should have watered more frequently from the onset of flowering and put them in some of my deeper raised beds. Still on peas, Colin Randel of Thompson and Morgan says older growers tend to ask for taller peas so they don’t have to stoop when picking. Their other advantage over modern, shorter varieties, bred to be harvested with a combine harvester in one go, is that they reward you with multiple crops. On Colin’s advice I am sowing a new pea called 'Terrain’ (available soon from Thompson and Morgan ). Its standout quality is that after being sown on July 30 last year they were still being picked in mid-November, which is extraordinarily late. He says they stood out like a beacon in the trials as their green foliage resisted the mildews that hit many other varieties. Sow later to beat the heat Sweetpeas also love a deep, moist root run, and later sowings can be highly successful. Ian Thompson, a head gardener with whom I work, put me onto this. He usually sows some in late June for later garden decoration and cutting. The sweetpea specialist Roger Parsons, meanwhile, agrees that although hot, dry conditions normally shorten the flowering period for sweetpeas, these later-sown plants seem to withstand the hot, dry conditions much better. Bunny's red onions have done well this year. Copyright: GAP photos As to problems with bolting of onions , Radio 2’s Terry Walton told me that some varieties of onion are far better from seed than setts. 'Red Baron’, for example, will often bolt from the latter but not the former. My red 'Electric’ onions, however, which went in last autumn from setts, have done me proud with no sign of bolting at all. I wish I could say the same for my dill, which seemed to want only to flower, producing pretty much no leaf at all. I know Mary Berry says dried dill is just as good for gravlax – but I think it is cheating. This weekend I will be sowing a dill variety called 'Hera’ (kingsseeds.com), which is slower to bolt according to recent AGM trials. Peter Miller from Kings Seeds thinks that much of this is down to sowing time (as with coriander). He advises always to avoid sowing in June and July; sow it in August and again next spring. I will sow a batch in August as I did this time last year as the plants, which were outside, carried me right through the winter to early summer and were brilliant as an alternative to basil in pesto and added sparkle to many winter curries and kedgerees. Another useful piece of information from Peter Miller concerns 'Big Daddy’, an impressively flavoursome beefsteak tomato . Last year he grew it outside (although I think it would probably do better indoors) and it was cropping by mid-August, which is amazingly early even for Essex. Some beefsteak tomatoes can weigh up to a kilo each, so if you are after whoppers, Peter says limit the numbers of fruit per truss to two or three. Pesky problems Netting is one way to keep pigeons off brassicas. Copyright, GAP photos Many gardeners are experiencing increasing problems with pigeons, which descend en masse as soon as the fields of oilseed rape are cut. While netting and spraying fortnightly with Grazers is a good option, I have heard of amazing success obtained by putting up an artificial hawk. Set one of these birds (£24.99 from The Trap Man ) at a height of about 2m on a pole directly over your brassicas to create a shadow over your crop to try to keep the pesky pigeons away. Another solution I have stumbled on is that by growing some of my cucumbers in straw bales in my greenhouse the red spider is non-existent – so far. Sadly, in many other parts of the country it is a major problem this year owing to the hot, dry weather. The humidity that the rotting straw bale contributes may be doing me a massive favour as my cucumbers have the healthiest foliage I have ever seen. With my cauliflowers (Sapporo F1), instead of letting them mature fully I cut them small while they still look good and bug free. Incredibly sweet and crunchy, they have been an excellent addition to my salads. Pippa Greenwood points out, wisely, that picking vegetables early can be a good strategy to avoid any potential bug and weather disasters. •What to do in the garden this week telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:15:33.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
