The SpringHill Suites by Marriott in downtown Houston is located on Dallas Street in the former Humble Oil Building complex, which was placed on the national register of historic places in 1999. The company first acquired the complex's three towers, which span an entire city block, in 2013 for $79.5 million . The previous 82-unit apartment tower has now been converted into a 167-suite hotel. The other towers operate as a 191-room Courtyard Houston Downtown Convention Center and a 171-room Residence Inn Houston Downtown Convention Center. Developers of the project preserved the 94-year-old building's original facade and windows, while adding an outdoor swimming pool, fitness center and 24/7 market to the building. The hotel will also feature iridescent tile walls, creative lighting fixtures, marble vanities and rooms with separate living, working and sleeping spaces. The SpringHill Suites downtown will operate as a Marriott International Inc. (Nasdaq: MAR) franchise and will be managed by Indiana-based White Lodging Services . Several other Marriott hotels have opened recently or plan to open soon near the historic building. Last year, the JW Marriott Houston Downtown opened on Main Street. The 328-room hotel, equipped an art gallery and in-house restaurant won HBJ's 2015 Landmark Award in the rehabilitation/renovation category. Marriott also broke ground in 2014 on the Marquis Houston , which will be adjacent to Discovery Green and the George R. Brown Convention Center and will feature a rooftop lazy river in the shape of Texas. It is slated to open in 2016. Overall, downtown Houston is seeing a wave of new hotel construction projects in preparation for the 2017 Super Bowl. Five projects with a total of 1,906 rooms were underway as of March. \nGet Houston Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T16:49:58.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
