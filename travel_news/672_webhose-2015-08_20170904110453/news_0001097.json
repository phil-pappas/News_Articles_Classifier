Flybe are also flying from LCY throughout the summer for the first time, to the likes of Aberdeen, Belfast, and Exeter.\nJuly was a seven year high for sterling and holidaymakers who headed out to sunnier climates in France, Italy and Spain benefitted by getting 10% more euros for their pounds, while business travel has continued to go from strength to strength – more than half of LCY’s customers in the second quarter of 2015 were travelling for business purposes, with business destinations Edinburgh, Dublin, and Amsterdam the most popular routes.\nLCY Chief Executive Officer Declan Collier said: “I am delighted to announce that for the second time this year we have set record passenger numbers, a big milestone in the history of our airport.\n“These numbers are undoubtedly a reflection of the continuing improvement in the UK economy, but also confidence from our customers, who know that they can get here from the centre of London in just 20 minutes, check-in in under five minutes on average, and get away on time – we’re the most punctual airport in London once again this year.\n“But these record figures also underline that we must be allowed to grow. The £16 million plan to transform our Western Pier departure gates will provide huge benefits when complete in autumn 2016, but it is only a small step on the journey to improving our airport.\n“It is critical that we are allowed to proceed with our City Airport Development Plan (CADP) that will deliver better infrastructure, more jobs for our local community, better facilities for our airlines, and a better passenger experience for our growing passenger numbers.”\nLCY has mounted an appeal against the decision by the Mayor of London to refuse permission for CADP. The plans, which include building a parallel taxilane and seven new aircraft stands, will provide vital London airport capacity, create 1,500 new jobs and generate £1.5bn annually for the UK economy by 2023.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:54:26.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
