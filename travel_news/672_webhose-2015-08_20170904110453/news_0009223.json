PUBLISHED: 11:09, Fri, Aug 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:43, Fri, Aug 21, 2015 GETTY West Beach from Broadchurch \nSo it’s not wonder that some of the key scenes from this year’s film Far From The Madding Crowd were filmed there. \nWest Beach, as well as being that beach with the crinkly cliffs in television’s Broadchurch (a third series is being filmed there this summer), is also where farmer Gabriel Oak’s bloated sheep ended up dead after tumbling over the cliff in the film. \nAnd Gabriel’s shepherd’s hut and sheep scenes were shot in a field above Down House Farm in Higher Eype, which you can sort of see as you prepare for the hard slog up Golden Cap, the highest point on the South Coast with panoramic views along this Jurassic Coast – famous for the fossils in its crumbling cliffs. \nWe were staying at Amber Cottage, one of several contemporary-styled self-catering cottages in what were once barns and a dairy at Manor Farm in Charmouth, a seaside village that Jane Austin described as “the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide”. GETTY The happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide Jane Austin \nWith its brilliantly equipped kitchen, reclining armchairs and TV with DVD player in the lounge plus powerful shower in the modern bathroom, Amber Cottage was an oasis of comfort after our five-hour hike along the cliffs. \nIt is one of a terrace of holiday homes overlooking an indoor swimming pool for guests and those staying at the farm’s adjoining caravan and campsite. \nWe were just a 10-minute walk from the beach and a half-hour’s drive from Mapperton House, the 17th century manor house used as Everdene Farm in the sumptuous new film. \nStarring Carey Mulligan as Bathsheba Everdene and Matthias Schoenaerts as the singular Gabriel Oak, much of the countryside would be recognisable to Hardy, who was born in Dorset and lived there most of his life. \nMapperton’s Italianate gardens, with their fountains and topiary, grottoes and statuary, are open from March to October, with the Jacobean house open on weekdays in July and early August (see www.mapperton.com). 20TH CENTURY FOX Scene from Far From The Madding Crowd \nAnother nearby historic home with a starring role in the film is Forde Abbey, which doubled as the corn exchange. \nThe former Cistercian monastery turned stately home near Chard is renowned for its 30-acre all-season garden. \nThe spring bulbs are particularly impressive and when we visited the herbaceous borders were at their stately best – although autumn is almost as colourful thanks to the arboretum.. \nThis year it has an Autumn Colours Week from October 24 to November 1, and throughout November there is free entry to the garden from Thursday to Sunday every week (see www.fordeabbey.co.uk). \nWe didn’t visit Dorset’s famous Durdle Door beach, where Bathsheba’s ne’er-do-well sweetheart Sergeant Troy (Tom Sturridge) swims out to sea, or the lovely old town of Sherborne, which was used for the Casterbridge Fair scenes, but we did visit Dorchester – the town Thomas Hardy had in mind when he wrote about Casterbridge. \nA Blue Plaque on Barclays Bank in South Street says the building was the model for Henchard’s House “lived in by the Mayor of Casterbridge in Thomas Hardy’s story of that name”.
