Source: Supplied \nA BRITISH reporter has sparked fierce debate calling parents who bring their kids on a plane “selfish.” \n“Your holiday starts from the moment you sit on the plane. You let out that sigh of relief, you’ve left work behind, left all the stresses behind and you take off and all of a sudden you get the kicking at the back of your seat or you get the wailing” said Kelly Rose Bradford. \nSpeaking on the UK television show This Morning , Mrs Bradford raised eyebrows by calling for child-free flights and child-free zones on planes. \n“Surely that would be better for everybody.” \nDespite admitting to taking her son William, now 12 years old, on planes when he was a baby, Mrs Bradford said there were times she didn’t bring him out of consideration for others. \n“I took him on short haul flights when he was a baby, when they sleep and feed throughout them and then I had this little interlude from when he was 18 months until he was about two-and-a-half,” Mrs Bradford said. \n“I didn’t travel, I didn’t fly with him simply because I didn’t want the grief and I didn’t want to subject everyone else to it as well because I know how irritating it is when you are the person sitting next to that family, behind them or in front of them.” \nAnd what about those who continue to take their babies on flights? \n“Is it really necessary to take a tiny baby on a long flight,” she asks. “I think there’s an element of selfishness from parents who insist on not changing their lifestyle once they have their children because there are some things that just aren’t practical. \n“The reason I think it is slightly selfish is that when you’ve got a child who is like 1-3-years-old, they couldn’t really care less whether they’re going to Brighton or Barbados on holiday. It’s the parents who choose to take them on these long flights.” \nShe suggested a separate section for children as a solution. \n“We’ve got business class, we’ve got first class, why can’t we have a family section? \n“Surely that would be better for everybody? You’ve got miserable, moany people like me who do not want your delightful children wailing in my ear for my flight. \n“But obviously from your point of view and your children’s point of view, if there’s a dedicated family area where the cabin crew are just looking after families, where the children can play, can be noisy, nobody would be bothered.” \nThe comments sparked much debate on Twitter, with opinions divided. #thismorning this women is having a Laugh right ??
