These special excursions perfectly complement the recently announced overnight stays on over 40 Caribbean sailings departing January 2016 and beyond – more than any other cruise line.\nCelebrity’s Caribbean Evenings Around the World program offers guests a curated menu of evening experiences that go beyond the port, expose travelers to the true soul of the Caribbean, and provide experiences that can’t be captured on a postcard.\nGenuinely Caribbean excursions include evening jazz, bonfires and exclusive boat parties in Cozumel, Mexico; an exclusive wine tasting at the Caribbean’s first winery in Willemstad, Curacao; drifting along Aruba’s picturesque coastline, to live Caribbean music, on a special sunset cruise; and nighttime, horse-drawn carriage tours along winding cobblestone streets, past historical colonial mansions in Cartagena, Colombia.\n“We have created ‘must-do’ experiences to give our guests a unique way to enjoy the vibrancy of the Caribbean at night,” said Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, President and CEO, Celebrity Cruises. “More time at the port means more time to explore, and we now offer more overnights, more excursions and more of the Caribbean than any other cruise line. We are taking vacationers beyond the ordinary to capture firsthand what makes each island truly special.”\nCelebrity’s Evenings Around the World shore excursions are available in Caribbean destinations such as Cartagena, Colombia; Philipsburg, St. Maarten; Cozumel, Mexico; Aruba; Curacao and Barbados.
