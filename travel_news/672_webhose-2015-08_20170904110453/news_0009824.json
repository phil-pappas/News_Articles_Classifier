This review process has been consistent with the practices and criteria used in previous Port internal investigations.\nThe investigation concluded: the e-mails violated the Port’s e-mail policy (Code of Conduct CC-7), no evidence of racial bias was involved, and the disrespectful language was in conflict with the Port’s Values Statement. As a result of this situation, two employees have left the organization and changes have been announced in the Port’s management structure.\nSource:- Port Seattle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:16:15.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
