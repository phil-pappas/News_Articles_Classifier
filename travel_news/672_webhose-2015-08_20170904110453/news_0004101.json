Today, they are gaining positive exposure across the country by earning a ranking on the Inc. 5000 list, proving that they have consistently grown and have been successful within their industry for many years. This is the fifth time that BuyAutoParts.com has appeared on the Inc. 5000 list, with their most recent appearance occurring in 2014.\nThe Inc. 5000 list has BuyAutoParts.com in the category of Consumer Products and Services and their rank is #4,075. On the 2014 list, their revenue was $42.1 million with a 101% growth rate. In 2015, BuyAutoParts.com had a revenue of $45.9 million and a three-year growth rate of 70%.\nSince the Inc. 5000 list tracks revenue growth over a three-year period, this ranking is very significant for BuyAutoParts.com. The difficult economic environment of the past several years has not hindered BuyAutoParts.com, as they have overcome challenges and come out on top of their industry.\nBuyAutoParts.com is one of the only businesses of its kind on the Inc. 5000 list, as just over 200 companies made the list within their category. Additionally, BuyAutoParts.com stands out as one of the few companies who distributes specialty auto parts online. The Inc. 5000 list only includes companies that are US-based, independent, and privately held, so many companies that compete within the same market as BuyAutoParts.com do not qualify. Those features make the company stand out and succeed with customers who appreciate their US-based operations, independence, and privately held ownership.\nSince this is the fifth time that BuyAutoParts.com has appeared on the Inc. 5000 list, they will be officially considered for the Inc. 5000 Honor Roll, taking a step up from the already impressive title of Multi-Year Honorees. They first appeared on the list in 2011 and have received a ranking every year since then. Their presence on this list for five years in a row proves that BuyAutoParts.com has consistently demonstrated high growth and is committed to providing their customers with exceptional products, value, and service.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131126/LA23860LOGO\n releases/buyautopartscom-makes-inc-5000-list-for-fifth-time-300129609.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20131126/LA23860LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA81423&Transmission_Id=201508171934PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA81423&DateId=20150817", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/buyautopartscom-makes-inc-5000-list-for-fifth-time-300129609.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20131126/LA23860LOGO"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T07:43:00.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
