The initiative makes Avis the first car rental company to offer this capability. The enhanced application guides customers enrolled in Avis Preferred, the Company's express rental/loyalty program, through the reservation process through spoken and visual prompts for airport rentals around the globe. The application speaks and displays four car classes (compact, intermediate, full-size and luxury) as well as the car rental's estimated total cost. Once the reservation is made, customers will automatically receive a confirmation email. In addition, users can use their voice to initiate a call to customer service using the app. \"This new enhancement is another easy, convenient and fast way for the busy traveler to make, change or cancel reservations and reach customer service,\" said Neal Zamore, vice president of consumer marketing and customer relationship management, Avis Budget Group. \"Our new app is like having a personal car rental assistant with you around the clock. We hope our valued Avis Preferred members appreciate this added benefit.\" The voice mobility feature builds upon the Company's commitment to put the customer first by employing the latest technology to enhance the rental experience. To utilize the new feature, travelers must be Avis Preferred members and have their rental preferences on file. With Avis Preferred, members can also earn points for every dollar they spend on vehicle rental and select optional products. In addition, members can skip the counter and paperwork at many locations and go straight to their car, enjoy Avis Preferred Select & Go, the Company's vehicle selection service available at top airport locations in North America, and receive e-receipts upon completion of the vehicle return process, which saves time and paper and eliminates the problem of lost receipts for travel expense accounting. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:39:29.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
