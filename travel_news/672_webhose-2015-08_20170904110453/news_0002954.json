Committed to quality and provenance, they grow herbs, cure and smoke meat and fish and make their own bar cordials and shrubs on site, using unusual ingredients to great imaginative effect without ever lapsing into preciousness. The menu is helpfully divided into ‘bite’, ‘small’ and ‘large’ dishes, all cooked with careful consideration. Lunch or dinner around £25-£40; reservations recommended (0131 221 1222; timberyard.co ) • The best hotels in Edinburgh • Top 10 bars and pubs in Edinburgh 21212 Michelin-starred Paul Kitching (not to be confused with Tom Kitchin) works his endlessly inventive magic in a classic Georgian townhouse, its décor an immaculate lesson in soothing modern elegance. With never more than three courses and a new menu each week, he achieves a delightfully light-hearted feel for such serious cooking. Do not come here if you like your food simple: with a reputation for completely unique if startling flavour combinations that always work, this is a chef at his most playfully confident. Three-course lunch menu from £32; set-price five-course dinner £69; reservations recommended (0131 523 1030; 21212restaurant.co.uk ) 2121212 Restaurant Martin Wishart Awarded the first Michelin star in Edinburgh in 2001, Martin Wishart was a fine-dining pioneer in Leith. The restaurant serves what I can only describe as tweezer food with attitude: painstakingly composed to create the prettiest plates imaginable, but full of intense and sometimes surprising flavours. The piped music is puzzlingly intrusive for such an elegant, restrained setting, but it is the only off-note in a more often than not pitch-perfect composition. The six-course tasting menu, including the signature ceviche of Gigha halibut with mango and passion fruit, costs £75; there is a fish and shellfish version for the same price or, more unusually, a £70 vegetarian tasting menu as well. If fiscal responsibility intrudes, try the terrific Tuesday to Friday lunch menu for £28.50, or head to Wishart’s popular brasserie, The Honours, on Castle Street just down the hill from Princes Street. Reservations recommended (0131 553 3557; restaurantmartinwishart.co.uk ) • The best holiday apartments in Edinburgh ravioli-wishart-use The Kitchin Cherubic-looking Tom Kitchin took only six months to earn his first Michelin star at this restaurant in a converted warehouse on a previously uninspiring street in Leith. Applying classical French technique and exactitude to predominantly Scottish ingredients, he doesn’t just talk the talk about his ‘nature to plate’ philosophy. With a new facelift and expanded premises it should be a little easier to get a table at the weekend or during the summer, but it is still safest to book well in advance – although it is always worth checking for last-minute cancellations. Set-price lunch £28.50; otherwise lunch or dinner around £65 (0131 555 1755; thekitchin.com ) • Edinburgh city break guide Number One, The Balmoral With Jeff Bland, the executive chef who's held a Michelin star for 13 years, and his talented head chef Brian Grigor, the newly refurbished Number One at the Balmoral Hotel continues the tradition of serving some of Edinburgh's best food. The deep red lacquered walls, covered in an intriguing selection of modern art, warm oak floors, deep banquettes, and generous space between tables give a feeling of old-school glamour and ease. There's nothing old school about the cooking, though, with dishes to make you sigh with quiet pleasure - the signature Balvenie smoked salmon is a silken, citrusy delight. Three-course a la carte menu £70; reservations recommended (0131 557 6727; roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/the-balmoral-hotel/restaurants-and-bars/number-one ) The Gardener’s Cottage With communal seating at two tables in one room and one table in the other, this little restaurant is no place for misanthropes. It really was a gardener’s cottage although it sits rather incongruously just off the busy London Road. They grow vegetables out front to prove their credentials and the look is sympathetically simple, although I would describe the cooking as sophisticated-rustic. If you are a vegetarian or have allergies, request a copy of the set menu in advance so they can accommodate your needs. For those who just have to have a choice, lunch is served à la carte and there is brunch at weekends. Lunch around £25-£30; set-price dinner £35; reservations recommended (0131 558 1221; thegardenerscottage.co ) • Free things to do in Edinburgh gardeners-cottage Restaurant Mark Greenaway You have to love a man who is all about puddings, which means I have the biggest crush in the world on Mark Greenaway. Peanut caramel cheesecake has my name written all over it, although 11-hour slow-roasted belly pork makes me go weak at the knees as well. Since his appearance on the TV show The Great British Menu, tables at the restaurant have been more in demand than ever, but the £22 pre-theatre Market Menu is worth eating early for. Lunch or dinner around £35; also £22 pre-theatre menu; reservations recommended (0131 226 1155; markgreenaway.com ) • The best b&bs in Edinburgh The Scran and Scallie ‘Scran' is a Scottish word for food, while ‘scallie’ appears to mean squint-eyed — which must refer to people having trouble with the menu, which is littered with phrases like: ‘sit ye down yer welcome’ and ‘nae meat, nae fish’. Don’t let these regrettable lapses into tweeness send you running for the door, because the food at Tom and Michaela Kitchin’s new venture is as good as you would expect from a man with two Michelin-starred restaurants on his CV. The sheep’s heid broth is a great deal better than it might sound and main course portions of fish pie and meltingly delicious braised hogget are enormous. If you want to be sure of a table make a reservation, but they do hold a few tables back every service for walk-ins. Children allowed until 10pm. Lunch or dinner around £18-£30 (0131 332 6281; scranandscallie.com ) scran-and-scallie The Dogs David Ramsden, owner of The Dogs, is an Edinburgh restaurant stalwart (and well-known curmudgeon), and this consistently good, mid-priced place to eat is his response to the ubiquitous gastropub. It serves what can only be described as good, honest cooking in an appealingly rambling, just the right side of scruffy setting. The menu is heavy on recession-busting offal and cheaper cuts of meat, like liver, oxtail, venison and rabbit. The wine list is as straightforward as the food, with many bottles under £20. It is usefully located on Hanover Street between Princes Street and George Street. Lunch around £15; dinner around £20-£30; reservations recommended (0131 220 1208; thedogsonline.co.uk ) dogs Ting Thai Caravan Chef Ting’s restaurant started life as an itinerant pop-up across several Festival seasons before disappearing again like a swallow with a poor sense of direction. However, it has now settled into an Old Town nest and shows no sign of flying off anytime soon. This is as close as Edinburgh gets to real Thai street food: hot, sour, sweet, slippery, crispy, comforting and utterly addictive. It is food for sharing… and fighting over. The food comes in cardboard boxes, they don’t take credit or debit cards, you can’t book, service is stripped back and so is the décor, but who cares when it all tastes so good? If you don’t like perching on high stools at communal tables you can order take-away, but either way be prepared to wait – everyone wants a taste of the Thai life. Panang Nua, £8.60 (00 44 131 225 9801).
