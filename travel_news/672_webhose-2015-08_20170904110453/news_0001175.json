Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 04, 2015 Adv: \nAlready serving Tanzania’s most extensive scheduled route network, Auric flies to 30 destinations across East Africa’s largest country with their fleet of ten Cessna C208B Grand Caravan aircraft, has the airline earlier today confirmed the addition of Kahama and Shinyanga during the month of August. \nShinyanga is the headquarter town of the region going by the same name in Northern Tanzania while Kahama is the home of the district headquarters of the same name in North Western Tanzania with the towns approximately 110 kilometres apart. Flights to the two destinations are likely to be combined and operate out of Mwanza. \nShinyanga Airport, IATA coded as SHY and Kahama will likely be served through the Bulyanhulu airstrip outside the town. The area, already a major centre for mining activities, has few tourism attractions though and the flights are therefore mainly aimed at commercial and business traffic. \nIn addition does Auric also operate tourist charters on demand to smaller airfields close to the more remote safari camps out of their three hubs of Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mwanza.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:28:40.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
