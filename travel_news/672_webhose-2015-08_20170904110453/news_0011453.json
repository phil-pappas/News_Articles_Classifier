Nothing says summer in England quite like taking to the water for a leisurely punt along the river. Dappled sunlight, the slow rhythm of the water lapping on the edge of the boat, the quiet, gentle motion, picnic hampers and strawberries and perhaps a bottle of something cold and sparkling… When we punt it’s as if we’re characters in Brideshead Revisited , tapping into an idyllic past of languid, easy aristocracy. The beauty of it is, of course, that you do not need either to be a student at one of the world’s best universities or a member of the upper classes to live out the dream yourself. Channelling your inner Sebastian Flyte for an afternoon is not only surprisingly affordable, but it’s also remarkably easy to master. Many places offer the chance to punt – but let’s be honest: if you’re going to punt anywhere, you’re going to have to punt in either Oxford or Cambridge. These cities are the spiritual home of the pursuit, and both offer leafy, soft-flowing rivers that almost feel designed for it (the Cherwell in Oxford, the Cam in Cambridge). Both cities offer numerous spots from where you can hire a punt. An hour on the river will set you back around £20 for a punt that can hold up to five people – and at four quid each, that’s cheaper than a pint of beer per person. Punting is one of those activities that is at once easier and harder than it looks. When done properly it appears effortless; when done badly, hilarious Guided punting tours are also offered, in which you simply lie back and relax and let an experienced punter do all the work for you. Although that may seem a smart option for the nervous or lazy, the real fun comes in doing it yourself. Punting is one of those activities that is at once easier and harder than it looks. When done properly it appears effortless; when done badly, hilarious. The trick is to let the pole do the work. Stand at the back of the punt in an easy, comfortable stance and let the pole slip through your fingers until it’s resting on the river bed. Then simply push off and walk your hands up to the top of the pole as the punt moves forward. When you reach the top, gather it back up again, hand under hand, until your next push. Steering is a little trickier – after pushing off, let the pole trail behind you and use it like a rudder, dragging it left or right to turn your punt. It does take a little practice, but once you get the hang of it, gliding along the river becomes both easy and relaxing. And relaxation is the key: the point of punting is the journey itself. It’s a slow, leisurely, supremely laid-back way to experience the beauty of the river. And as you slip peacefully through the water it’s easy to forget about all the stresses and nonsense of the modern world and dream instead of how it must be to be a character in Brideshead Revisited . And that’s got to be worth twenty quid of anyone’s money.
