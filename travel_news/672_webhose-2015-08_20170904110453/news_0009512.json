Tucked away north of Highway 88 and east of Highway 49, little Volcano has managed to remain much as it was in Gold Rush days. The Whiskey Flat Saloon is an honest-to-goodness old-time saloon. If you rode up and hitched your horse in front of the Volcano Country Store, no one would bat an eye.\nCalifornia’s first theater company opened in Volcano in 1854 to entertain gold seekers. Over 160 years later, Volcano’s theater tradition still runs strong, with year-round productions by the Volcano Theatre Company. Spend your day exploring caves, hunting for swimming holes or shopping for antiques, but for the main attraction grab a bottle of Amador wine and head to the outdoor amphitheater for an unforgettable evening under the stars.\nWhy now? The warm evenings of summer in the Sierra foothills make for perfect play-watching weather. If you miss the summer season, you’re in for another treat: the changing green to red of the Shenandoah Valley vineyards in Amador wine country is one of the state’s most gush-worthy autumn sights, with or without a glass of local Zin in your hand.\nBackstory: A stroll around Volcano takes only a few minutes, but it just might offer more commemorative plaques per mile than anywhere else in the state. Volcano had California’s first theater company and circulating library. The first astronomical observatory in the state was just up the hill. The Moose Milk cocktail was invented there (perhaps). There was even a little-known Civil War standoff in town settled (without bloodshed) by a 6-pound cannon named Old Abe.\nThe name Volcano may be misleading, but it certainly doesn’t lack for geological interest. The vast caves of Black Chasm Cavern National Natural Landmark and their many wondrous formations were discovered by gold prospectors in the 1850s, and early tours were given in the 1860s, but it wasn’t until 2001 that the cavern was properly opened up to the public. Today, it’s one of the main reasons travelers stumble across Volcano.\nChecking in: The St. George Hotel is the first thing you see as you roll into town and the best place to roll out of bed in the morning. Built in 1862 (after the two previous hotels burned down) and one of California’s first three-story buildings, the hotel is charmingly creaky, with 14 rooms in the main building, six newer rooms in a rear addition, and two private suites hidden in the lush gardens.\nFor a unique camping experience that transports you back into California history, Indian Grinding Rock State Historic Park has seven traditional Miwok bark huts that hold up to six sleepers.\nSpend your day: Start your day on the rocks with a cave tour of Black Chasm, either a basic walking tour or the longer Labyrinth Tour for those who like a physical challenge. Head back into the light, and stroll the shops and cafes of Sutter Creek.\nThere are wine tasting rooms right in town, but it’s worth a drive through the Shenandoah Valley vineyards out of Plymouth even if you’re not a wine lover.\nWind back to Volcano by the back roads, and you’ll still have time to take in dinner and a show at the Volcano Theatre Company.\nDining: The Volcano Union Inn & Pub is the place to head for evening grub. The sister restaurant in nearby Plymouth, Taste, is one of the top fine-dining destinations in Amador County. The food is more low-key at the Union, but the pedigree comes through. For a nightcap (or an anytime-cap), a visit to the Whiskey Flat Saloon is a must.\nDon’t miss: Ice cream lovers will come from hours away just to sample the frozen delights at Munnerlyn’s Ice Creamery just up the hill in Pine Grove, a tiny shop with artisanal ice cream and creative flavors that would draw rave reviews in any major city, but without a sprinkle of snobbery.\nDon’t bother: Unless ducking into cramped, dusty holes is your hobby, don’t get drawn in by the signs to the Masonic Cave. It’s free, but you still might want your money back. The real cave is just down the road at Black Chasm.\nWord to the wise: Summer weekends at the St. George Hotel are wedding territory, so book early, go during the week, or try the Union Inn & Pub.\nAndy Murdock is a freelance writer in Alameda.
