(Photo: Ritwik Ghosh) \nAditi Rao Hydari’s Andheri apartment has three wardrobes full of clothes. And yet, like most other girls, she always wonders what to wear. Her sense of style is vintage and feminine, but Rao Hydari doesn’t shy away from experimenting either. \nStyle sensibility : “Style to me is an extension of my personality and attitude. For a lot of people, style is synonymous with buying expensive things, but I believe that becomes a burden. Even simple things can look stylish if you carry them off with a flair. Style is about having fun.” \nVintage girl : “For me, it is not about Indian versus western silhouettes. My body structure is such that I can carry off both. I love vintage fashion and it’s something I veer towards very naturally. If you put a vintage and an edgy design before me, I’ll pick the former. Also, I tend to lean towards feminine items.” \nWatch fetish : “I have a fetish for watches. I don’t know what it is about them that makes them so attractive. I could go without earrings, I could step out in slippers, but I need to have a good watch on. I have a decent collection, some of which I have nicked from my grandfather. There are a few from my grandmother too.” \nMost Attached To : “I am very attached to some of the jewellery my grandparents gave me. There’s this one piece I’m really fond of, which my grandfather gave me on my 12th birthday. It’s an old, uncut diamond piece with Basra pearls. It actually belonged to my great-grandmother. She was also 12 when she got it. I wear it every now and then.” \n\n\nGo-to outfits : “For casual wear, it would be playsuits, because they have a cute vibe. I also like a good pair of shorts and a ganji. For the red carpet, I love long skirts and crop tops — especially the voluminous skirts. I also love classic tube dresses with a big flair. That’s a very Audrey Hepburn-like silhouette. Also saris — they’re stunning and a complete no-brainer.” \nFashion faux pas : “Straight after London Paris New York (2012), I got a fringe cut. Once, for an event, I wore a lovely Gaurav Gupta gown and a pair of long earrings. I was told to leave my hair open and I ended up looking like I was going to school wearing a gown and earrings. It was quite weird. Thankfully, I’ve not had too many terrible experiences.” \nPhotos: Ritwik Ghosh \n(The writer tweets as @shaallwe ) \nWatch Aditi Rao Hydari gives you a sneak peak into her wardrobe \n<span itemprop=\"name\" content=\"Watch: Aditi Rao Hydari gives you a sneak peak into her wardrobe\"></span> <span itemprop=\"description\" content=\"Bollywood actress Aditi Rao Hydari gives you a sneak peak into her wardrobe while she defines style for her viewers.\"></span> <span itemprop=\"duration\" content=\"145\"></span> <span itemprop=\"thumbnail\" content=\"http://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1679921/sp/167992100/thumbnail/entry_id/0_sz6y6ihm/version/100002/acv/162\"></span> <span itemprop=\"width\" content=\"640\"></span> <span itemprop=\"height\" content=\"368\"></span> Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T02:47:01.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
