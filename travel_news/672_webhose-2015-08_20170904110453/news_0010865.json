Details Category: Awards   12:00 This year’s inaugural London Venue Awards is encouraging all venue employees past and present and suppliers to cast their vote for the Best Venue To Work For. This exceptional, free-to-enter category in the new awards is aimed at identifying venues that inspire their employees and suppliers to go the extra mile, creating an environment where the whole team is motivated to deliver the highest level of service to clients. \nRory Ross Russell, Co-Director of the Global Conference Network (GCN) who organise the awards, says: “Having a team that is energised and feels valued at your venue will translate into great customer service for clients. This award category really will be a people’s choice and we are looking forward to seeing who comes out on top.” Entries to the Best Venue To Work For category are free of charge. Votes can be made via the online form at londonvenueawards.co.uk by September 11th 2015. The shortlist will be announced online in September and the winners revealed at the awards ceremony on October 16th at the Emirates Stadium in London.
