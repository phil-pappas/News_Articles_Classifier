Economic recoveries across the U.S. and in east Central Florida — which PNC defines as Deltona, Orlando, Palm Bay, Port St. Lucie and Vero Beach — and lower transportation costs are boosting consumer confidence and buoying travel and tourism in the region. In addition, several investment projects in hotels, resorts and high-speed rail suggest that tourism’s long-term outlook is bright, the report said. Other findings from the report: Professional services and health care continue to grow strongly, as they have for several years. The regional jobless rate fell to 6.4 percent in May from 7.2 percent in the prior year, while the labor force grew at a healthy rate. In mid-2015, payroll jobs were up by 3 percent from their pre-recession peak. The region’s above-average rate of job growth is pushing aggregate personal income growth well above average. However, average earnings have not made progress because retail, leisure and hospitality are accounting for a disproportionate share of the region’s job growth, PNC said. The median income has been stuck at about 12 percent below the U.S. median household income for much of the economic recovery. Prior to the recession, the region’s median income was only about 5 percent lower. Looking ahead, PNC said, this pattern is unlikely to change materially. Home prices in the region are forecast to grow moderately in 2015 and 2016, thanks to stronger in-migration and a smaller amount of heavily discounted foreclosures. However, because the severity of the housing crash is expected to keep both buyers and builders more cautious, permitting and construction likely will settle at a new, significantly lower trend rate. It will easily take another couple of years for residential vacancy rates to normalize, PNC said. \nWant Orlando Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
