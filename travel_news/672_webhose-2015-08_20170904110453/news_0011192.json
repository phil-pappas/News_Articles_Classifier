It seats over 200 people and includes a large outdoor patio where guests can kick-back and enjoy the experience with friends and family. TR Fire Grill is Romacorp’s newest restaurant concept, launched in 2013 as a chef-inspired American bistro with cuisine from globally-recognized Chef Bob Gallagher. “We’ve spent nearly two years perfecting this concept, and now we’re so excited to open in Winter Park, where we believe our innovative cuisine and beverages will shine,” said Brad Smith, Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President. “We want our guests to think of us when they’re looking to enjoy a fresh, seasonally-driven dining experience, or when they’re simply in the mood for a refreshing cocktail to lift their spirits.”\nThe kitchen is open concept, offering guests an intimate glimpse at the fresh preparation each dish receives from the culinary team and enhancing the dining experience. Meats and veggies are smoked in-house daily using hickory wood for authentic flavor. Steaks are fresh and hand-cut daily in the restaurant, grilled to perfection on a wood burning grill. The filet and NY strip follow the guidelines of NatureSource® Natural Beef program, known for its grass-fed beef produced without antibiotics, hormones or GMOs. The menu offers locally-sourced ingredients using seasonal produce from farms in Central and South Florida.\nTR Fire Grill delivers a unique artisanal beverage experience, with a focus on craft beers, wines, and signature hand-crafted cocktails. Cocktails are made with liquors aged in small oak barrels or infused with the flavor of fresh fruit and spices in glass vessels at the bar. A unique selection of American craft beers and some of the best wines from the West Coast complete the beverage experience.\n“We’re letting the freshness and quality of our ingredients take center stage for authentic flavor that’s humble, yet powerfully impressive,” said Chef Bob Gallagher. “We’re passionate about the food we’re creating and we believe our guests will taste that passion, along with our attention to detail in every meal we craft.”\nRomacorp Inc. tested the TR Fire Grill concept at a location on Semoran Boulevard near the Orlando International Airport.
