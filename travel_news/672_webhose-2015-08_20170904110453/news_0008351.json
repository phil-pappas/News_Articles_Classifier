The agreement is part of an eight-month pilot program and marks the airport's second agreement with a TNC, airport officials said. \nTwo weeks ago, the airport announced it had entered into an agreement with Lyft, also under an eight-month pilot period. \nAfter the two respective pilot periods, airport officials will evaluate the success of the agreements and then review their options from there. \n\"Uber's availability at OAK expands our ground transportation offerings for our passengers,\" Acting Director of Aviation Kristi McKenney said in a statement. \"It is important that we are inclusive and responsive to customer demand, which includes the ability to use TNCs.\" Copyright Â© 2015 by Bay City News, Inc. -- Republication, Rebroadcast or any other Reuse without the express written consent of Bay City News, Inc. is prohibited.
