After the first initiative in Santiago and Buenos Aires in 2012, and the second in Colombia in December 2014, this one is going to take place in Chile and Peru on 17 and 18 September, respectively.\nThe World Travel Market team will be at the W Santiago Hotel in Santiago and the JW Marriot Hotel in Lima, where the events in both locations will begin at 8:30 a.m. and will include breakfast, which will provide an excellent networking opportunity for those attending. The breakfast will be followed by presentations that will include content that is both relevant and specific to the interests of the local tourism industry.\nThe main objective of the action is to present the opportunities and what’s new that the trade shows in the World Travel Market’s portfolio, especially the 2016 edition of the World Travel Market Latin America, offer in terms of their contribution to business turnover in the sector and growth in inbound and outbound tourism in Latin America and the world.\nThe successful WTM Latin America 2015 recorded impressive growth figures of 37% in the number of trip buyers, which firmly consolidates its position in the tourism industry. It also received more than 8000 visitors, 21% more than the previous year, and generated US$ 363 million in agreements signed during the three days of the event and in the months following it.\nThe events in Chile and Peru will also be attended by the CEO of Braztoa (Brazilian Association of Tourism Operators), Monica Samia. Braztoa has 90 associates, which represent 90% of the travel packages sold in Brazil, and Ms. Samia will share information and important data about them with tourism professionals present.\nResearch carried out after WTM Latin America 2015 indicated that 98% of the exhibitors consider it important to their business, while 95% said that the show is constantly evolving to meet the sector’s needs. The survey also revealed that 93% of the participants met quality professionals during the initiative.\n“This will be the perfect occasion for strengthening relationships with tourism professionals in Chile and Peru and presenting all the opportunities offered by WTM Latin America in its greater objective, which is to promote Latin America to the world and bring the world to Latin America”, says Lawrence Reinisch, Director of WTM Latin America.\nThe overall satisfaction of exhibitors also grew a lot. Consolidation of the event, its more central location, the presentation of more trends and insights and the quality of the events and buyers are just some of the factors indicated for its success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:56:45.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
