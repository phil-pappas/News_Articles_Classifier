The White House hosted Demo Day yesterday, an event to showcase the wide-ranging talents of innovators from across the country. White House chief technology officer (CTO) Megan Smith announced the plan July 13th at Fortune's Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen . Hundreds of companies applied for spots at the event, Smith said, and a small number were selected to present. Kris Akins , CEO and founder of BikeTrak, traveled to Washington and met with the President. The event was simulcast and the video can be seen at the White House Demo Day web site. \"We are honored to have the opportunity to demo the BikeTrak theft detection and activity tracking system to the President,\" said Akins, who presented to the President. \"Bicyclists have a real need to increase security and track their activity and BikeTrak will meet it. The White House support is tremendous to entrepreneurs and start-ups like BikeTrak that provide the seed for economic growth and new job creation.\"The BikeTrak theft detection and activity tracking system pairs a GPS and Cell connected device mounted to the bike with a mobile app on the cyclist's smartphone. It alerts cyclists if their bike moves unexpectedly and tracks its location. It will connect and post to stolen bike registries and social media, and will provide information needed for police and insurance reports. It also provides ride activity tracking including location, speed, mileage, and elevation and will connect to popular fitness, safety, and other activity tracking applications. The BikeTrak system is currently in the final stages of development and targeting launch in the near future. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:24:13.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
