In addition to the Maldives and Mauritius, Sri Lanka is yet another destination in the Indian Ocean.” \n\nThe Vienna-based airline also flies to Delhi, Bangkok, Beijing and Tokyo in Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:54:04.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
