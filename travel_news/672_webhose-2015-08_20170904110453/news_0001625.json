What about buying some Hawaiian Sun Papaya Pineapple Jam for your family and friends back home so they will suffer food poisoning from products you bought in the Aloha State? \nReading a review on Amazon Dianne Cardillo posted: Love it!, and gave Sun Papaya Pineapple Jam Five Stars. You may actually be better of to buy this delicious product at Amazon. \nFoodland Hawaii is a leading grocery chain with stores on all Hawaiian islands. When checking a Foodland Hawaii store on the Island of Oahu and with a large food and souvenir section including also Hawaiian Sun Products they put a number of exotic jam flavors on sale. Foodland offered this Hawaiian treat on a 2 for 1 basis. Buy 2, pay the price of one. If the deal sounds too good to be true - this one was. \nMy advice to a tourist ready to be: \"Please look twice.\" On the jam bottles in Foodlands shelf the expiration date printed in small letters on the bottle was from 2014 Most bottle showed expiration dates in early 2015, only 2 out of 20 had current dates in 2015, one had a 2016 date. Expiration date April 1, 2015 on sale on August 1, 2015 Expiration date February 8.2014 on sale on August 1, 2015 \nWhen eTN alerted a clerk she tried to explain there was no expiration date. \nThe manager finally agreed, apologized and took the large selection of expired Hawaiian Sun products off the shelf. \nMy tip for our visitors: Avoid getting sick in paradise and consider buying your \"fresh Hawaiian products\" at home!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T07:01:11.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
