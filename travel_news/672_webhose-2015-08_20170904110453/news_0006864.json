In July, the index equaled 135.0 (2000=100), the second highest level on record. The all-time high of 135.8 was reached in January 2015 .\nCompared with July 2014 , the SA index increased 3.7%, which was above the 1.9% gain in June. Year-to-date through July, compared with the same period last year, tonnage was up 3.4%.\nThe not seasonally adjusted index, which represents the change in tonnage actually hauled by the fleets before any seasonal adjustment, equaled 137.3 in July, which was 0.8% below the previous month (138.4).\n\"After several soft months starting in February, tonnage really snapped back in July,\" said ATA Chief Economist Bob Costello . \"July was the single best monthly gain since November 2013 .\"\nCostello said a few factors added to July's strength, including better retail sales, factory output, and housing starts. \"However, I remain concerned in the near term about the high level of inventories throughout the supply chain. This could have a negative impact on truck freight volumes over the next few months.\"\nTrucking serves as a barometer of the U.S. economy, representing 68.8% of tonnage carried by all modes of domestic freight transportation, including manufactured and retail goods. Trucks hauled just under 10 billion tons of freight in 2014. Motor carriers collected $700.4 billion , or 80.3% of total revenue earned by all transport modes.\nATA calculates the tonnage index based on surveys from its membership and has been doing so since the 1970s. This is a preliminary figure and subject to change in the final report issued around the 10th day of the month. The report includes month-to-month and year-over-year results, relevant economic comparisons and key financial indicators.\nThe American Trucking Associations is the largest national trade association for the trucking industry. Through a federation of 50 affiliated state trucking associations and industry-related conferences and councils, ATA is the voice of the industry America depends on most to move our nation's freight.
