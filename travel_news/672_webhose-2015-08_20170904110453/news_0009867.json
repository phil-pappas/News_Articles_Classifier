The city of Atlanta is excited to announce the imminent opening of its revolutionary retail space, Ponce City Market . Skylar Morgan Furniture & Design, however, is more than thrilled to announce its collaboration on a part of the architectural amazingnessWilliams Sonomas (WS) flagship southern location . Created via a close partnership led by Ponce City developer Jamestown Properties and Williams Sonomas in-house design team, Skylar Morgan was tapped to create furnishings and retail fixtures for a unique space that stays true to the soul of Ponce Citys historic Sears building and pulls inspiration from WSs legacy. Conceived by Chuck Williams on 1953 as an outlet for his passion for European cookware and started in a hardware store in Sonoma, California, WSs style has always been elegant and approachably functional. This space, studded with industrial and minimalist elements, takes the concept to new places that feel fresh and functional without veering into the cold or impersonal. Skylar Morgan-designed and fabricated standalone shelving units of raw, unfinished oak and custom-finished blackened steel, round display tables with metal bases, rolling ladders, steel and marble-wrapped checkout counters, and much more fill the space with fresh furnishings designed for modularity. Shelves are all adjustable with custom pins fabricated by Skylar Morgan. All units roll on large casters. One-of-a-kind cutlery and flatware bins feature WS Homes butter-soft leathers in its cubbies. This was as much an engineering project as a design exercise, says Skylar Morgan Managing Director Stephanie Morgan. Every detail was considered, from exposed rivets to the way shelves tilt and can be re-arranged to accommodate displaying different kitchen appliances. Overall though, were thrilled to have this opportunity to meld our skill set with an historic brand to help them evolve their design language in a way that honors their history and the feel of this amazing place, too. \nis a furnishings-maker and design studio contributing to the everyday dialog of design that is making the South a creative capital of the U.S. The studio creates friendly, functional pieces for commercial and residential spacesunique, high-end architectural woodworking and custom furniture designed to be eaten upon, stomped on, gathered around, shared and most importantly, lived in.
