Both restrict the amount you can pay in each year in order to benefit from those tax-efficiencies, and both limit your ability to withdraw money when you want without implications. What’s more, the ISA regulations limit the type of investment you can choose. So, for unfettered access to your money and to investment choices, our General Investment Account could be the answer. Many of our customers use a GIA alongside their ISA or SIPP, so if you open one of those accounts we’ll automatically add a GIA. And because we don’t charge separate investment administration fees for each account type, this added flexibility is good value too. (Please note, a separate SIPP Administration fee applies – see our charges for details.) • Investment choice – all in one place Whether you prefer to invest via funds or Investment Trusts for a more hands-off ‘managed’ approach, track indices with ETFs, pick your own individual stocks or take an active approach trading derivative-based investments such as Covered Warrants and Structured Products, you’ll find the breadth of choice you need to match your investment approach. And the information you need to help you make your choices.

Open your account today > Please bear in mind that the value of investments, and any income from them, can fall as well as rise so you could get back less than you invest. Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. ‘Complex investments’ are not suitable for all investors; please make sure you understand the additional risk involved. If unsure about whether any investment is suitable, please take independent advice. Tax rules can change over time and the benefit of sheltering your investments from tax in an ISA or SIPP will depend on your personal circumstances.
