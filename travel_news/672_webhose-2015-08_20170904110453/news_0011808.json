After a spate of high-profile shootings, consumers had rushed to buy more guns over concerns that politicians would restrict sales. Then the market seemed to have peaked and shares in Smith & Wesson and its slightly larger competitor Sturm, Ruger fell in 2014. The slump is over. Shares in Smith & Wesson rose 10 per cent on Friday to a seven-year high. Its stock is up 88 per cent this year, while Sturm, Ruger is up 77 per cent. \nTrading on about 7.5 times forward earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Smith & Wesson is no longer cheap. But profit estimates look light given this week’s strong fiscal first quarter. Adjusted net income rose 11 per cent to $17.7m; a gross margin of 39.8 per cent was the highest in the same quarter for at least 15 years — apart from the elevated buying in 2013. Although the company increased its guidance for the year it budgeted for a thinner gross margin. Smith & Wesson says it will be discounting to take market share. \nOther upside could come if Smith & Wesson wins a competition to supply a new pistol to the US army. \nBut it is also worth watching the presidential election. Barack Obama’s efforts to promote tighter gun control have prompted panic buying, and so proven to be good news for gun manufacturers. \nCongress seems an impenetrable barrier to tougher gun laws. But a president who can attempt to promote such laws from time to time could prompt another wave of demand from the public. \nEmail the Lex team at lex@ft.com Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
