That means there's the same level of hate in the broad market today as there was back in September 2008, back when stocks were getting hammered during the financial crisis. \nThe thing is, if some of that animosity towards the stock market is misplaced, it should spell a big buying opportunity in some of the most-hated names. \nLet me backtrack a bit. When I say that investors hate stocks right now, I'm talking about short interest . As I write, total U.S. short interest (that is, bets against U.S. stocks ) is at the highest level we've seen since September 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis. When the S&P 500 is sitting just 1.7% below all-time highs and investors are betting against stocks en masse, there's a pretty big disconnect going on. \nEither everyone is picking a broad market top correctly for the first time in stock market history, or Wall Street's most-hated names are getting oversold. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks George Soros Loves This Year \nSure enough, when short sellers pile into the big-name stocks, being a contrarian tends to pay off in a big way. Over the last decade, buying the most hated and heavily shorted large and mid-cap stocks (the top two quartiles of all shortable stocks by market capitalization) would have beaten the S&P 500 by 9.28% each and every year. \nA stock with a high level of shorting indicates that there are a lot of people willing to bet on a decline in its share price -- and not many willing to buy. Too much hate can spur a short squeeze , a buying frenzy that's triggered by short sellers who need to buy the stock at any price to cover their losing bets and exit the trade. \nOne of the best indicators of just how high a short-squeezed stock could go is the short interest ratio , which estimates the number of days it would take for short-sellers to cover their positions. The higher the short ratio, the higher the potential profits if the shorts get squeezed. \nToday, we'll replicate the most lucrative side of this strategy with a look at five big-name stocks that short sellers are piled into right now. These stocks could be prime candidates for a short squeeze in the weeks and months ahead. 1 of 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:14:52.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
