Kansas City released new images of its under-construction streetcar vehicles ahead of a planned announcement on the status of its delayed order. On Wednesday, Kansas City's Twitter account and Facebook page published four new images of the streetcar vehicle being built in Elmira, N.Y., by CAF USA Inc. On Monday, the city announced City Engineer Ralph Davis , a streetcar project manager, and Tom Gerend , executive director of the Kansas City Streetcar Authority Inc., were going to visit the facility and discuss the vehicle situation with the U.S. subsidiary of Spanish rail company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles S.A. The images released on Wednesday appear to show progress since the city last released images in August . Those images reflected the vehicle's state of construction on July 23. Messages attached to the new images said an update on the streetcar vehicles will be given during Thursday's meeting of the streetcar authority's board of directors and during a business session of the Kansas City Council on Thursday. Kansas City said in August that the delay is \"critical\" â€” meaning late delivery of the vehicles will delay the opening of the 2.2-mile streetcar line. The city has said CAF is proposing a December delivery of the first of four streetcars, but the city says that date is unacceptable. The Twitter account said a \"new delivery date (is) possible, but negotiations to continue.\" Kansas City ordered four streetcar vehicles from CAF for about $18 million in November 2013 with the expectation that the first vehicle would arrive in June 2015. Thursday's meeting of the Kansas City Streetcar Authority will be take place at noon at 300 Wyandotte St. in Kansas City. That building is the headquarters of Port KC, an organization formerly known as the Port Authority of Kansas City, Mo. \nGet Kansas City  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:30:14.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
