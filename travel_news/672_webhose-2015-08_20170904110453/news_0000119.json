On completion it will mean our investment in this part of London will total in excess of £2bn and help breathe new life into the area.\n“The new station will not only complement and enhance London Bridge Quarter but it will make the visitor experience so much better. I believe the long term benefits significantly outweigh some of the short term inconvenience that such a major piece of new infrastructure inevitably creates.”\nThameslink Programme director Simon Blanchflower said: “Rebuilding a station in this way does not just improve travel, it acts as a catalyst for regeneration and development. More than 140,000 people come through London Bridge station every day and when our work is complete those people will not only have a much better station, but also a place to meet, to eat and shop – along with fast and frequent trains to Farringdon, St Pancras and beyond.”\nWhen the redevelopment is completed London Bridge Station will become one of the capital’s truly major transport hubs as it enables easy access to Heathrow airport – through interchange with Crossrail at Farringdon – as well as direct journeys to Luton and Gatwick airports as well as St Pancras International and destinations as diverse as Cambridge, Brighton and Peterborough.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:38:59.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
