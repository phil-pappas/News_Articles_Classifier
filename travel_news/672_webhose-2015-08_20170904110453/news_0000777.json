The GSTC Board of Directors plays an integral role in the leadership of the organization. Most seats on the board are filled via annual elections of and by current members of the Council. The GSTC Election Committee has validated the votes and has released the results.\nTwo current board members were re-elected: Heidi van der Watt (Better Tourism Africa) and Melinda Watt (Earthcheck, as the board’s designated Certification Representative). The election brings one new member to the board: Molly Turner (Airbnb).\nCommenting on the election, Board Chair Luigi Cabrini stated “I am very pleased to welcome the newly elected and re-elected members of the Board. The GSTC can count on a vibrant, committed and respected group of professionals ready to engage with all its members and to strengthen our organization as a global leader on sustainable tourism.”\nGSTC CEO Randy Durband adds: “As we welcome one new board member and the return of two through re-election, we wish to acknowledge and thank outgoing board member Gwen Migita for her contributions. She devoted her time and organizational resources from Caesar’s to support GSTC, especially in the area of our communications activities and team.”\nm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:49:55.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
