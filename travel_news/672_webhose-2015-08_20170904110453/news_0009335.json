My self-belief is still there and that’s because I continued to work as hard as I have throughout my career,” he said.\n“For me to have success, it’s always been about my preparation and working hard. That gives me my best chance.\n“At the end of the day, you can only do your best. While I keep doing the preparation I’m doing, I believe I can have success out in the middle.”\nClarke will consider taking some time away from the game in the coming days, at the advice of close friend Shane Warne, as he looks to try and freshen up before the do-or-die encounter at Trent Bridge.\nBut come match eve on Wednesday he will have had to make a big decision on where he will bat at Nottingham.\nClarke possesses one of the best records of any No.5 in history, with extraordinary numbers of 20 hundreds at an average of 61.83.\nJoe Root catches Josh Hazlewood rocket 0:46 Play video\nCricket: England's Joe Root takes a spectular catch to dismiss Australia's Josh Hazlewood for 11.\nFox Sports 31 Jul 2015 Sport/Cricket/Ashes/Highlights At No.4 where he has based himself in more recent years, that average sits at just 30.89 with five tons.\nClarke is open to change, but only if it benefits the team structure.\nHe and selectors would have to be satisfied Adam Voges’ likely replacement Shaun Marsh would be up to the pressures of No.4.\nAt the end of the day Clarke says batting position is a sideline issue to the cold hard facts that he needs to lift and lead from the front.\n“That’s 100 per cent my own form,” he said.\n“I think it’s always going to be hard to beat any opposition when they’ve got 11 and we’ve only got 10.\n“At the moment that’s how it feels. With my performances so far I certainly haven’t led from the front like I’d like to do as captain.\n“I’ve always made that very clear, that’s a big part of my role as leader of this team, that I’m scoring plenty of runs and leading by example.\nClarke is averaging less than 50 in Test cricket for the first time since 2012.

No.4 is such a critical position, you need to make sure you’re scoring a lot more runs than I have been so far.\n“I will wait and see what XI the selectors give me (regarding batting order). It’s never bothered me.\n“Statistically it shows that I have performed a lot better at No.5 than No.4 but it’s not like I have walked in at 2-10 throughout this series.\n“I think our whole top order has done a really good job.\n“The number is irrelevant, it’s about what’s best for the team.\n“If the team needs me to bat at No.4 (I will), if the team needs me to bat at 5 I will bat at 5.”\nClarke’s brutal self-appraisal even extended to the point of taking responsibility for Voges shocking form.\nVoges is in line to be dropped, but Clarke said it was on him.\n“I am more concerned about my form. When you bat at No.4 in an international cricket team, you have to make sure you lead the way and make runs.\n“If I make runs I am sure Vogesy will follow.”\nAdam Voges’ form struggles have mirrored those of Michael Clarke. Source: Getty Images\nClarke said he was unsure whether he had the personality to follow Warne’s advice and take time away from the cricket field in order to relax his mindset.\n“Someone like Ricky Ponting used to go and play a week of golf and then walk onto the field and make a 100 without picking up a bat at training – that’s never really been me,” he said.\n“That’s the reason I played (the tour match) at Derby. The selectors asked me if I wanted to have that game off but I wanted to go to make sure I could do my training and have a bat as well.\n“The next few days will be about balance. When I’m not training, trying to get away from the game and clear my head – but training is still a big part, that’s what’s given me the success I’ve had throughout my career.\n“I have stuck to it to date and I don’t think it will change now.”\nOriginally published as Clarke’s stunning Ashes admission", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/01/1227465/711707-a212e9b4-37c5-11e5-9c70-bb8d701e73e2.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/ashes-2015-michael-clarke-says-his-poor-batting-form-has-let-australia-down/story-fni2fnmo-1227465711735", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217244225&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/01/1227465/711281-7d990992-37c5-11e5-9c70-bb8d701e73e2.jpg", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217209245&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/07/31/DVU_310715_CRI_ASHES_ROOT_CATCH_HAZLEWOOD.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-08-01T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:54:10.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
