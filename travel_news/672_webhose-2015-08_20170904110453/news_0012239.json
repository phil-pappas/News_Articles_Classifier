Set foot on Antarctica – As any adventurer worth his or her worn-in \"bunny boots\" will agree, you ain't hardcore till your gnarled toes have stepped onto the coldest place on the planet. Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 8. Take the ultimate road trip – Route 66 has been called \"the most famous highway in the world,\" and it remains the ultimate road trip. More than 2,000 of Route 66's original 2,448 connected miles can still be driven. Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 7. Photograph the \"Big Five\" on safari – For those wanting to photograph the \"Big Five,\" -- plus a few extras -- there's South Africa's Kruger National Park. The largest game reserve in South Africa, it's home to over 500 bird species, 100 reptiles and nearly 150 mammals. Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 6.

Hide Caption 7 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 3. Admire the sunset over Santorini – Open any Greece travel brochure and chances are you'll see a shot of the famed blue and white domed houses of Santorini. But the island's sunsets, which rank up there with some of the best in the world, are just as deserving of travelers' attention. Hide Caption 8 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 2. Sleep in an overwater bungalow – Nothing says \"my vacation is way more awesome than yours\" quite like an Instagram photo posted from the Four Seasons Bora Bora. Hide Caption 9 of 10 10 photos: Dream journeys 1. See the Northern Lights – Akureyri, Iceland is one of many cool places to get a glimpse of the greatest show on earth, the Northern Lights. Hide Caption (CNN) There are two types of vacations. The ones we take once or twice a year to recharge and reconnect with those close to us -- maybe a quick getaway to a resort somewhere hot or a road trip to Disney with the kids. Then there are the ones you spend your whole life dreaming about, whether it's a luxury African safari or a road trip down Italy's Mediterranean coast. The latter is the inspiration behind TripAdvisor's new list of 10 trips of a lifetime, compiled based on user votes. Warning: Seasoned travelers will scoff at some of the picks. \"Santorini? Been there done that -- 20 years ago.\" 1. See the Northern Lights The greatest light show on earth. Hands down. But before you get too lost in the beauty of the Northern Lights, it's worth remembering there are some pretty impressive forces at work behind the scenes. Caused by collisions between gaseous particles in the Earth and sun's atmospheres, the Northern Lights commonly appear during the winter months in northern countries like Canada, Finland, Alaska, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and the place that seems to be on everyone's travel wish list right now, Iceland. That includes Akureyri, which topped Lonely Planet's \" 10 Best Places in Europe \" list in June. Less than 100 kilometers from the Arctic Circle, it's Iceland's second-largest city and a great spot to watch the aurora borealis dance through the sky. \nSaga Travel - Day Tours , Kaupvangsstraeti 4, Akureyri 600 Iceland; 2. Sleep in an overwater bungalow The Four Seasons Bora Bora has 100 overwater bungalows. Nothing says \"my vacation is way more awesome than yours\" quite like an Instagram photo taken from the edge of your overwater bungalow -- particularly when it's in Bora Bora, according to TripAdvisor's users. Can't decide which resort to choose? The Four Seasons Bora Bora is consistently rated as one of the world's best overwater bungalow resorts. Not hard to see why. It's made up of 100 overwater bungalows with traditional teak wood furnishings and roofs thatched with pandanus leaves that sit on stilts over a turquoise lagoon. \nFour Seasons Resort Bora Bora , Motu Tehotu BP 547, 98730 French Polynesia; 3. Admire the sunset over Santorini Open any Greece travel brochure and chances are you'll see a shot of the famed blue and white domed houses of Santorini. But the island's sunsets, which rank up there with some of the best in the world, are just as deserving of travelers' attention. The village of Oia is where you'll find some of the best sunset views, whether you choose to take it all in from a restaurant or offshore on a boat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:29:20.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
