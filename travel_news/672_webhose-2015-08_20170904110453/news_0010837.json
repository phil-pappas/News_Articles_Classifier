Every year, the publication invites readers to rate travel categories such as airlines, cities, cruise ships, hotels, etc. In the category of destination spa, readers rated five characteristics-accommodations/facilities, treatments, service, food and value-in which Golden Door scored 98.33 out of 100 points.\n\"We are so pleased and humbled to be recognized with this award,\" said Kathy Van Ness , Golden Door general manager and chief operating officer. \"We thank our loyal guests for their support and our dedicated employees who make this magic happen every day. During the past several years, we have worked hard to make improvements for our guests, including a $15 million renovation of the facilities and upgrades to the guest rooms.\"\nGolden Door provides seven-day stays for a maximum of 40 guests, each in a private room, with a ratio of four staff members to each guest. With a nod to busy individuals, the spa recently added three- and four-day-stay options. Guests are encouraged to pursue a healthy mind, body and spirit with a focus on fitness, spa and nutrition programs, all personalized to meet the goals and needs of each individual.\nIn addition to a complete range of daily and optional spa services, Golden Door offers hiking and mountain-biking trails, a 2000-square-foot equipment gym, two swimming pools and a therapy pool, three group exercise studios, a Pilates studio, cycling room and tennis court.\nThe 600-acre property features mature Japanese gardens, bamboo forest, woodlands, mountains and citrus, avocado and olive groves. The culinary gardens and orchards, which are organically and bio-intensively farmed, provide a large portion of healthy garden-to-table meals for guests.\nDuring the past year, the spa has expanded its retail products, which until now were available only onsite and online. On September 1 , Golden Door opens two retail kiosks, one at Westfield Century City and one at Westfield UTC in San Diego . These first off-site kiosks feature selected products from the Artisan Food, Skin Care and Jewelry lines. Gift certificates for visits to the 2015 World's Best Destination Spa also are available.\nPerhaps the most innovative and far-reaching endeavor is Golden Door Foundation, established in 2013. The spa's philosophy of helping to transform lives extends beyond those of guests to select local, national and international charities. As a show of support to those involved in making the world a more loving, more humane and more peaceful place, Golden Door pledges 100 percent of net profits from the resort to select charities that make a difference in the lives of children.\nAbout Golden Door\nwww.goldendoor.com\nThe Golden Door experience empowers each guest to achieve a healthy mind, body and spirit.
