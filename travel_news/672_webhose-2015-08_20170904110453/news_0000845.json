In baseball, his only chance at sudden death is a walkoff home run — which he has done six times in his career. By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nLOS ANGELES — Andre Ethier hit his second dramatic homer in three innings — a two-run shot in the 10th — to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a three-game Freeway Series sweep with a 5-3 victory over the sputtering Los Angeles Angels on Sunday. \nThe Dodgers are 4-0 when Ethier hits cleanup. \nDrew Rucinski walked Adrian Gonzalez with one out in the 10th before Ethier deposited the rookie right-hander’s 1-1 pitch into the Angels’ bullpen in right field for his 12th homer and the Dodgers’ NL-leading 131st home run. \n“I guess I did it at the right time today and put us over the top,” Ethier said. “In baseball, there aren’t too many times where you get to take the last shot, and that was one of those opportunities right there.” Most Read Stories Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's \nThe Dodgers’ second three-game sweep of the Angels put them a season-high 15 games over .500 (60-45). \nThe loss was the Angels’ season-worst sixth straight and ninth in 10 games after a 17-3 stretch that matched the best 20-game span in franchise history. Notes \n• The New York Mets recalled top hitting prospect Michael Conforto from Class AAA Las Vegas when fellow outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis was placed on the 15-day disabled list with discomfort in his neck and left shoulder. \nConforto, from Redmond High School, was optioned to Las Vegas on Saturday to make room for slugger Yoenis Cespedes , acquired Friday in a trade-deadline deal with Detroit. But the rookie never even left New York, and he was back on the big-league roster before Sunday night’s series finale against Washington. \nConforto was 4 for 19 (.211) with two doubles, three walks and five runs in six games with the Mets. He had three RBI. \n“He wouldn’t be here if he’s not going to play,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. \n• Kansas City Royals pitcher Edinson Volquez , after Toronto Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson objected to tight pitches during their game: “He’s a little baby. He was crying like a baby.” \n• The Minnesota Twins will place pitcher Tommy Milone on the 15-day disabled list with a mild left elbow strain, retroactive to Saturday.
