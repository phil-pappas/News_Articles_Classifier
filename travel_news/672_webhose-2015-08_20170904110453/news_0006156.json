Sky News 06 Aug 2015 News Tough going ... GO Phoenix experiencing rough conditions in the search for MH370. Picture: ATSB/Supplied Source: Supplied \nREUNION island will launch a one week search for further debris from MH370, starting today. \nMilitary police, armed forces, the island’s civil aviation body and local police will work together, said Reunion’s top politician Dominique Sorain. \nThe search zone will be determined by ocean current mapping. After seven days of searching, Mr Sorain said the search would be suspended for an analysis of results. \nMr Sorain said Reunion authorities had been waiting for confirmation the debris found last Wednesday was from MH370 before acting. Search ... officials have released a map of the MH370 search area around Reunion Island. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nHe said no sonar technology would be deployed, but that for one week every resource on the island would be dedicated to a surface search for more evidence on the waters and coastline of Reunion. \nIt was the first official statement from the Reunion government. He was joined at a press conference by Jacques Luthaud, commander of the French southern Indian Ocean armed forces who will supervise the military aspect of the search. More aid ... The Reunion island government has officially spoken for the first time, announcing its intention to dedicate all of the island’s resources to searching for MH370 wreckage for one week. It will join Malaysia’s (above) search teams.

One of his aide’s later said “window matériel” was found by the four-person delegation sent to Reunion. \n“This is just not true,” said a source close to the investigation. “There has been no extra matériel, no plane window. \n“French authorities were with the Malaysians while they searched the beach on Tuesday and they are not aware of this debris.” Discrepancy ... Local government on Reunion Island has contradicted Malaysian Minister of Transport Liow Tiong Lai’s claims that debris found on the island is from Flight MH370. Picture: Kena Betancur Source: AFP \nOne of those Malaysian officials revealed there were tensions among coordinating authorities. \n“I know this is difficult,” he said of the wait for answers. \n“But we must respect the local authorities here and they are answerable to Paris. \n“All I can say is that I am sorry. It would be different if we were in Malaysia, but we are not.” \nFrench authorities on Friday said they would begin air, land and sea patrols for more evidence of MH370 around Reunion Island. \nThe belated start to official searching came nine days after a council worker discovered a wing part from the downed plane. Wing part ... The debris that sparked it all. Picture: Supplied Source: Twitter \nUniversity of Toronto forensics engineer Doug Perovic said the discord between the main players — Malaysia, France and Australia — was difficult to understand. \n“I’m surprised that with all that’s happened in the past, and we all think of the families who are suffering greatly, to be once again stretched and pulled with this uncertainty I don’t get that,” said Dr Perovic. \nAmerican aviation safety expert Captain John Cox said there were only two missing flaperons on earth. \n“And they’re both from MH370,” said Captain Cox. \nLate on Thursday, Mr Liow, speaking in Kuala Lumpur, had said paint and maintenance-record matches proved the flaperon was from MH370. A seal on the wing part was the conclusive evidence. \nA Malaysia Airlines maintenance expert identified the seal and the international team analysing the part in France agreed, he said. Experts can’t agree on plane wing part \nOngoing tests on a Boeing 777 flaperon have triggered a new round of speculation on the final moments of MH370. \nAs French investigators continue to examine the plane part which Malaysia has confirmed as belonging to the missing jet, experts have put forward new theories about the crash. \nWhile some believe the intact flaperon is proof of a “controlled ditching” by the plane, others are convinced the part was “sheared off” as the 777 plunged at high speed towards the ocean. \nFormer pilot turned author Peter Lee said from what he had seen of the flaperon in the media, its condition made the “soft landing” theory significantly more likely.

Mystery ... No one has been able to explain the disappearance of MH370 on March 8, 2014. Picture: Greg Wood/ Getty Images Source: Getty Images \nProfessor Perovic said he saw no reason to believe that mechanical or systems failure could not have caused the MH370 “ghost flight”. \n“There’s no disputing that the pilot turned the plane back in an almost U-turn after the last communication,” said Prof Perovic. \n“The trajectory of the flight path was directly in line with the Malaysia Airlines’ maintenance facility. \n“It could be coincidence but you could argue the pilot was trying to get the plane back to get repaired and things on board were just getting worse and worse.” Final path ...

Source: Supplied \nHe said by steering the plane away from land, the pilot may have been preparing for a water landing when the oxygen supply ran out. \n“I can’t fathom what it would be like to be in a position of the families right now but given a choice I would find it easier to deal with the possibility it was a mechanical problem rather than some sort of intentional act,” Prof Perovic said. \nUS aviation safety consultant, John Cox said it was pure speculation to postulate a death dive. \n“If the flaperon departed prior to impact then it would indicate an in-flight break up,” said Captain Cox. \n“This is a possibility but there is no hard evidence to support or refute it. \n“Theories abound, facts are few.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:28:43.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
