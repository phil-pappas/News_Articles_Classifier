More than 80 per cent holiday bookings are done online and the number of consumers heading to their local travel agent continues to deplete.\nEvery flight, hotel reservation and online currency exchange creates data which the travel industry can utilise to improve the customer experience. With all of this data available, and the rise of impressive technology to make travel fun, interactive and simple, it’s surprising that so few of our journeys are really seamless. Too often the entire system is broken down into siloes; airlines don’t collaborate with hoteliers, who in turn don’t talk to the travel agents themselves.\nThe rise of big data means travel businesses have the ability to build in-depth profiles of their customers. However, despite it being easier for airlines to collect passenger data than ever before, only 20 per cent currently use such data to offer passengers a personalised experience.\nAt the same time, Ofcom statistics show smartphones are now UK’s preferred device for connecting online, moving ahead of laptops for the first time. It’s now natural for customers to be using their mobile devices whilst they travel to check on traffic, bookings and updates. When used wisely, this combined consumer data and connectivity can form the basis of a personalised, seamless travel experience, facilitated by emerging technologies such as iBeacons and wearables.\nA seamless travel experience should use technology to put the customer first. It should close the gaps between a previously siloed process, via an accessible online user interface. After all, if a seamless process is available, why would a consumer choose to book travel through a business which doesn’t communicate with any other element of his or her journey?\nThe recent partnership between KLM and Uber proves this collaboration works. Last year customers that booked European city trips through KLM automatically received €30 of Uber credits to take them to their hotel. United Airlines is also collaborating effectively – its app includes inventive features such as passport scanning and a travel wallet for customer convenience as they travel.\nThe travel industry has clearly started to realise the potential of seamless travel but there is still a long way to go before the industry as a whole meets consumer expectations. Travel businesses need to start innovating now, in order to keep up with the competition.\nNow that consumers are becoming tech-savvy, the time has come for the travel industry to embrace the technology at hand and put customers first.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:08:23.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
