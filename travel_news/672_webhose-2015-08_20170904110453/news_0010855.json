Of the games produced in the first six months of this year, worth a combined 45 billion yuan (£4.5 billion), almost 24 per cent was exported, up 121 per cent year-onyear, according to the 2015 China Gaming Industry Report. The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, the industry regulator, also approved the release of 355 online games over the same period, up 88.7 per cent year-on-year. The increase in domestic titles has helped boost the Chinese gaming market, which stood at 60.5 billion yuan in July. The key is combining regional and Chinese culture in the game export markets The gaming report said emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, India and South America, where competition is less intense, were the main target markets for Chinese developers. West House, a unit of Beijing software company Kingsoft Corp, said it had concentrated on overseas markets for three of its latest games, while Perfect World, which started to work with Xbox in September, released its blockbuster, Neverwinter Online, in 78 countries and regions. The game reached number one in the North America Massively Multiplayer Online gaming market in the first quarter of this year. Xiao Hong, chief executive of Perfect World, which is also based in Beijing, said the worldwide success of Neverwinter could be attributed to having the right talent and innovation. “More importantly, the key is combining regional culture with Chinese culture in the markets where the games are exported to,” he added. All companies will come to realise that only the best quality games can survive FL Mobile, which specialises in the distribution and operation of games for mobile devices, has also found success abroad, including in South Korea. The company’s co-founder and chief executive, Ni Xianle, said strategy games and role-playing games are the most popular Chinese products overseas. “Exporting a large number of games is not necessarily the right tactic,” he said. “At the end of the day, all companies will come to realise that only the best quality games can survive.” Tap4Fun, based in the western city of Chengdu, specialises in mobile games and said overseas markets contributed almost 96 per cent of its sales revenue last year compared with 94 per cent in 2013. However, Chinese developers still have some way to go to catch up with their international rivals. According to market consultants AppAnnie, only seven Chinese companies feature in the list of the world’s 52 top mobile game developers. Tap4Fun is ranked 45th.
