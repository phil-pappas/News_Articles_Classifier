And China has been the world's largest auto producer and seller for six years from 2009 to 2014. In 2014, auto sales reached 23.4919 million in China with a year-on-year increase of 6.9% while auto output reached 23.7229 million, increasing 7.3% year on year. Specifically, passenger car sales reached 19.7006 million in China in 2014 with a year-on-year increase of 9.9% while auto output reached 19.9198 million, increasing 10.2% year on year. The rapid growth in auto output and sales promotes the fast development of automobile distribution industry.\nThe level of concentration in auto market is rising fast. In 2014, 6.245 million vehicles were sold by the top 100 dealers in China with a year-on-year increase of 12.5%, among which 0.35 million are due to second- hand car replacement which increasingly contributes to the sales of new car. In China , quite a few car dealers report a higher profit than listed car makers.\nAs car market in big cities has already saturated while that in small and medium- sized cities is growing fast, car dealers find it the hope for future growth. Due to car markers' high attention to big cities as well as the ignorance of small and medium- sized market, there are few distribution channels in small and medium- sized cities and the competition there is not that fierce too. Meanwhile, as the land and labor force is relatively cheap in small and medium- sized cities, the cost is low.\nWith the rapid development of Internet in China in recent years, such concepts as Internet and O2O exert increasingly remarkable influence on auto sales and service with new forms of marketing keeping springing up and e- business of car industry developing fast. For example, many car makers and dealers have introduced new distribution channels through cooperation with such platforms as B2C and C2C.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1 Overview of Automobile distribution Industry in China , 2010-2015\n2 Business Model of Automobile distribution Industry in China , 2011-2015\n3 Major Auto Dealers in China , 2011-2014\n4 Competitiveness Analysis of Auto Sales Channels in China , 2011-2014\n5 Investment and Financing Analysis of Car Dealers in China , 2011-2014\n6 Expectation to Automobile distribution Industry in China , 2015-2019\nCompanies Mentioned\n- China Grand Automotive Services, Co., Ltd\n- China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings Limited\n- China Zheng Tong Auto Services Holdings Limited\n- GWQM Corporation\n- Hengxindelong\n- Lei Shing Hong Limited\n- Pang Da Automobile Trade Co., Ltd\n- Shanghai Kailong Automobile Trading Co., Ltd.\n- Sinomach Automobile Co., Ltd\n- Zhongsheng Group\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4qm578/research_report\nMedia Contact: Laura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/2015-research-report-on-chinas-automobile-distribution-industry-300134666.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4qm578/research_report", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN89027&Transmission_Id=201508281210PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN89027&DateId=20150828", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2015-research-report-on-chinas-automobile-distribution-industry-300134666.html"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:07:45.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
