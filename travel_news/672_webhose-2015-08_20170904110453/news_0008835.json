AirAsia Berhad management is puzzled as to why MAHB is extremely hesitant to make the documents public to the members of the media, the public and especially the airport operator’s biggest client at klia2 if indeed MAHB has received them.\nWe hope this simple request will be met with the appropriate response by MAHB.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:21:26.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
