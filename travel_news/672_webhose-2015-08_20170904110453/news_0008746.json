A blended wing design would mean better fuel management enabling direct flights from Europe to Australia\nThe AHEAD aircraft, which stands for Advanced Hybrid Engine Aircraft Development, is being designed to carry 300 passengers over a range of 8,700 miles – which would put the UK within striking distance of .\nWriting on the company's blog, KLM engineer Rob Duivis says: 'A blended wing body is one of the very promising designs to minimise the drag and, is so doing, making aircraft much more fuel-efficient.'\n Disgruntled mothers up in arms after Coventry hotel sign...

Flaming craters, ice tunnels and hot springs filled with... 662 shares Another key feature are the two hybrid engines, which make the plane much greener.\nThe first burns either cryogenic hydrogen or liquefied natural gas (LNG), and the second burns either kerosene or biofuel, thus reducing emissions into the atmosphere.\nWhile KLM bosses insist the innovative design could well be the future, it is still some way off\nThis is instead of turbofan engines, where heated air powers turbines.\n'By using two different combustor and fuel systems, the engine's total efficiency increases and emissions are reduced,' added Duivis.\nBut don't get excited just yet, as KLM's concept is a long way from becoming reality.\n'The AHEAD design is a long-term study, with many aspects yet to be researched,' said Duivis.\n'The timeframe for introduction of an aircraft of this type is expected to appear sometime around 2050.'\nBlended wing body concept by Cranfield University (related)", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1fHLJnt"], "published": "2015-07-30T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:21:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
