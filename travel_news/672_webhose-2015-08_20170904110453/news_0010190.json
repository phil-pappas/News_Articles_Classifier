Just showing ordinary people living their lives, dreaming their dreams, makes us truly appreciate that we are all the same. Africa also needs marketing like this to combat what people see in the news every day. \nYou can really help promote a positive image of Africa by telling others back home about your trip. Tourism is the mainstay for many African economies, it supports thousands of local jobs. When Ebola made headlines last year, it affected the tourism industry throughout Africa - even in South Africa, Kenya and Botswana - literally thousands of miles away. People in London and Paris lived closer to the outbreak than Tanzanians or Zambians. If you combine the USA, China, India, Europe and Japan â€“ they all fit into Africa. In fact the USA fits into the African continent three times! The tourism sector has still not bounced back from the \" Ebola Scare \" and this means thousands of jobs lost, and also leaves wildlife in increasing peril from poachers (and American hunters). \nOf course safety is a big concern for anyone planning a vacation , but Africa's reputation as an unsafe, poverty stricken destination is unfair for the vast majority of the continent. There are middle class people in every African country commuting to work every day, complaining about taxes and watching their kids play soccer every weekend. Diseases take millions of lives every year in Africa because the poor lack access to childhood immunization programs and basic health care, not because the continent is infested with scary illnesses. \nHelp Promote a Balanced View of Africa The way many people perceive regular daily life in Africa is not even close to reality. If you can show your friends and family back home photos of people going about their daily business, market places filled with traders, and stalls piled high with food, you'll already be doing your job as \"responsible traveler\". Take videos of churches filled with song and kids running home for lunch in their smart school uniforms. Check out these \" Myths and Misconceptions of Africa \" and help try to dispel them! \nYes, there is lots of poverty in Africa, but that doesn't automatically mean there is misery. I've seen more smiling faces and genuine joy coming from barefooted children in Tanzania and Malawi , than from my kids classmates at school in the US. The key is to help promote a balanced view of Africa. If you happen to be in Rwanda's capital Kigali , of course the Genocide Memorial Museum will be a main attraction, but don't ignore the vitality you will feel in this pleasant, clean little city. Take a motorcycle taxi ride, head up to the hills and enjoy the views, it's all there. \nEncourage Friends and Family to Visit Africa Some destinations in Africa are easier to sell than others. The fine wines and world class restaurants in the beautiful Cape Winelands beats anything that Napa Valley or the Loire Valley has to offer. Pictures of the Serengeti , the Victoria Falls and other top destinations in Africa will make all your Facebook fans swoon with envy. Keep posting them. \nDon't Be Afraid to Go to Africa There are so many different vacations on offer in Africa , there will always be something to suit you.
