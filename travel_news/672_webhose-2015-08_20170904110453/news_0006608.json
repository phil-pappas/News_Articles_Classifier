What many people don’t realise is that the epidemic is in West Africa and we (South Africa) hasn’t seen a single case of Ebola,” she said. \n\nShe added that she hopes to see the National Department of Tourism working closely with local travel agencies to organise fam trips. \n\nWhen questioned about whether the showcase is exclusively catered to South African destinations, Ngubeni explained that they want to package the whole of Africa as a travel destination instead of just focusing on South Africa. \n\n“We hope to encourage tourists to come visit South Africa and, at the same time, travel to other parts of Africa as well. There are waterfalls, wildlife and mountains as well as a range of activities that they can experience,” she added. \n\nThe Africa Showcase will next be in Jakarta on August 20, and followed by Russia, Ukraine, the US, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, before ending in Australia and New Zealand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T08:21:19.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
