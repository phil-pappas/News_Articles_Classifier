(\"CEOC\") have entered into a Bank Restructuring Support Agreement (\"Bank RSA\").\nThe agreement, which is effective immediately, secures the support of CEOC's largest and most senior creditor constituencies and represents a key milestone in Caesars Entertainment and CEOC's efforts to implement a consensual restructuring of CEOC. CEOC's restructuring is now supported by CEOC's First Lien Bank Lenders and First Lien Bondholders, which represent the most senior $12 billion of CEOC's capital structure.\nCaesars Entertainment and CEOC continue to engage in discussions with junior creditors to build additional support for the previously announced Second Lien Restructuring Agreement in an effort to complete the restructuring consensually. However, the senior creditors' support of today's agreement paves the way toward a confirmable plan for the restructuring of CEOC.\nThe Bank RSA is substantially similar to the previously announced Bond RSA. The Bank RSA and a summary of the transaction are available in the Media Resources section of the CEOC Restructuring Web site at http://www.ceocrestructuring.com/media-resources/ .\nAbout Caesars Entertainment Operating Company Inc.\nCaesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc.
