Not at first.\nIn fact, not until the very end of “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.” does writer-director Guy Ritchie connect the men with the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. Before they get there, in the end credits, the initials associated with them are CIA (for Solo) and KGB (for Kuryakin). It’s 1963, you see, Cold War prime time, and also the era of the super-popular prime-time spy series starring Robert Vaughn and David McCallum that brought the world of James Bond-style derring-do to the small screen.\nMovie Review ★★★   ‘The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,’ with Henry Cavill, Armie Hammer, Alicia Vikander, Hugh Grant. Directed by Guy Ritchie, from a screenplay by Ritchie and Lionel Wigram. 116 minutes. Rated PG-13 for action violence, some suggestive content and partial nudity. Several theaters.\nRitchie’s retooling of the U.N.C.L.E. concept tells how these espionage adversaries first meet and are forced into an uneasy alliance to thwart a plot involving a loose nuke, an icy blonde and a leering Nazi torturer. Now, before you groan, “What? Not another one!” — know this: The picture is quite clever and light on its feet.\nMost Read Stories Seattle to crack down on drivers who clog intersections Hisashi Iwakuma throws fifth no-hitter in Mariners history Seahawks training camp impressions: Chris Matthews, K.J.

Seattle-area consumers asked to cut water use by 10% Cavill’s Solo is a dapper smoothy, always well-turned-out (early on, a character zings him as “Mr. Important Suit”) and ever so self-satisfied, with eyebrow permanently arched and a sly superior smirk always at the ready. Hammer’s Kuryakin is the more interesting of the two (though his Slavic accent is dubious): tall, capable, super strong (early on, Solo notes with awe his ability to rip the back off a speeding car), hot-tempered and scornful of Solo.\nTogether, they spark off one another like a well-coordinated comedy team, which they kind of are, mocking each other’s spycraft and sartorial choices (“the bow tie doesn’t work with that suit”).\nThere is a woman, of course, a feisty beauty played by Alicia Vikander, who looks sensational in ’60s-inspired couture and is the men’s equal when it comes to delivering sardonic repartee.\nThe story, by Ritchie and co-screenwriter Lionel Wigram, is a mélange of espionage hugger-mugger with a zip-line escape over the Berlin Wall along with car chases and shootings in lovely foreign locations (Italy, in this case).\nNothing much new here, but it’s all carried off by Ritchie with great visual verve (lots of split screens) and snappy dialogue.\nSome of the best and funniest bits happen in the background of scenes: a comical dance routine by Vikander and a sequence where Solo munches a tasty picnic-style supper, casually watching while a shoot-’em-up boat chase with Kuryakin as the quarry plays out in the distance.\nAs the end-credit, U.N.C.L.E.-explicating sequence makes clear, the movie is basically a setup for a sequel. I wouldn’t mind seeing it.\nSoren Andersen: asoren7575@yahoo.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:20:52.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
