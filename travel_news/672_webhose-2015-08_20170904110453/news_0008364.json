The information comes in the form of a bar chart that appears as part of search results. For example, when searching for Kelly Tarlton's Sea Life Aquarium, just tap \"More about Kelly Tarlton's\" and a chart will appear showing the busiest times. You can then see at a glance if it's going to be busy when you plan to visit and change your plans if you don't like queuing. It also helps planning ahead, so if you want to visit Auckland Museum on the weekend, it's much quieter on Saturdays than Sundays.
