It is the only place you can see million-pound race cars from the 1940s-1960s driven at full speed in genuine, white-knuckle competition. But it’s not the only motorsport event held at the Goodwood estate in West Sussex. There’s also the Festival of Speed, held each June. Since 1993, the world’s fastest cars have gathered there to prove themselves in one of earth’s toughest tests of grip, acceleration and sheer nerve: the Supercar Shootout – more commonly known as the Goodwood Hill Climb. Rising over 300ft from start to finish, the narrow 1.16-mile course is a white-knuckle ride comprising tight turns, thick woods and a section where drivers must head straight for a flint wall before turning at the last moment. Formula One cars no longer take part for safety reasons, so the coveted title of fastest hill climb is an annual fight between the world’s best drivers in cutting-edge supercars. Each year, 900 of them roar up the hill, come rain or shine, in a genuine test of speed and ability. In third place this year was an Aston Martin GT12 driven by Matt Becker. In second place was a Lexus LFA driven by Chris Ward. But the clear winner was the UK’s Anthony Reid, driving a 650-horsepower British-built Noble M600 equipped with Michelin Super Sport tyres.
