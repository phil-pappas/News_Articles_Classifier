Recognising the importance of events and festivals in York, this new app, easily downloadable to any iPhone, means from now on visitors and residents can look up what’s on in this vibrant city at the touch of a button. ‘What’s On York’ has been developed by Make It York, to promote events and festivals and make it easier for people to make the most of all that the city and region has to offer.\nThe app allows users to browse the latest events and festivals across York and the surrounding region in the palm of their hand and for the first time users can rate York events, share via social media channels and get directions through an interactive mapping feature.\nThis 21st century visitor app was first conceived as part of a competition run by Venturefest at York Racecourse last year; a one-day event showcasing Yorkshire’s most inspiring science, technology and innovative entrepreneurs, where a number of digital and software businesses were invited to bid to win the project. Control F1, a Huddersfield based digital company, came up with the most imaginative solutions for this project and were awarded the brief.\nMichelle Brown, Leisure Marketing Manager at Make It York, said, ‘Festivals and events are a key motivator for a visit and play a crucial role in the vibrancy of the city. This new app means we can get better information to even more visitors and residents about events such as the Food and Drink Festival. It’s also a brilliant new tool for event organisers to ensure their news is quite literally in the palm of everyone’s hand.’\nEvents featured on the York Events App are fed through from the city’s award- winning official visitor website www.visityork.org and this purpose built app will also enable audiences to rate their favourite event, as well as uploading photos using Facebook and social media accounts.\nPoppy Williamson, Digital Marketing Manager at Make It York said, ‘One of the most trusted ways of getting recommendations is through word of mouth. This new app means you can now access those recommendations from your top pocket. Over the last year, we’ve seen a 153% increase in visitors accessing information from their smartphones and this is a 21st century new way to find out what’s on in the city and its surroundings.’\nSource:-Visit York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:00:24.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
