Ever since I opened my presents on Christmas morning, 1989, and found that Santa had brought me Kylie's eponymous LP, I've been obsessed with music - specifically anything that uses a synthesiser and has a catchy chorus. I was a huge Spice Girls fan (in every sense - I had a lot of puppy fat to boot.) I learned the lyrics, bought the cassette singles and attempted to give myself Geri hair with some food colouring and a packet of Weller ‘’Shaders and Toners’. But I won't be going to see their anniversary world tour next year - it would be like swapping a g&t for a Panda Pop, or ditching my jeans in favour of knock off Adidas trousers. In early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked upon a world tour covering Europe and North America. The Spiceworld Tour kicked off in Dublin, Ireland on 24 February 1998 before moving on to mainland Europe and then returning to Britain for two gigs at Wembley Arena and twelve gigs at Birmingham’s NEC Arena.

She's also one of the most successful, impressive and inspiring business people that I'm aware of. Her fashion empire is worth a fortune – she’s been named the top entrepreneur in the UK and her net worth is £210 million. She took a non traditional route into the fashion world. Critics reasonably argue that being an internationally successful pop star with an established personal brand and a megastar husband makes life as a designer somewhat easier than slogging your guts out at Central at Martins and hoping the big fashion bloggers like you. But if you cast your mind back to the mid to late nineties, Posh was a fashion joke. I once heard a rumour that a huge fashion house sent her a handbag made by their biggest rival, as a bitchy branding exercise. Posh used to be a fashion joke However, the people who used to laugh at her look now spend hundreds and thousands of pounds on Net A Porter, buying the clothes she has made. It's a testament to her grace that she handles her new role with sophistication. (Meanwhile I'd be channelling Simpsons character Nelson Muntz , pointing at my former haters and saying 'Haw haw!') Her former musical colleagues have done well for themselves too, staying in the spotlight and working in radio (Emma Bunton), musical theatre (Melanie Chisholm), TV talent shows (Melanie Brown) and, erm, being George Michael’s mate for a bit (Geri Halliwell). But Beckham is the only one who seems to have capitalised on the promise and potential of the group’s original feminist message. She’s a highly successful woman, and she knows that to align herself with Girl Power once more would mean taking a step backwards. Halliwell's departure from the group shocked fans and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year Photo: PA It feels like no time at all since the last Spice Girls reunion (London 2012 Olympic ceremony anyone?). Any goodwill towards them generated by nostalgia has been totally drained. Like many fans, I’m bored of seeing them behaving like the girls they used to be, and I’m much more interested in learning about the women they have become. Feminism has moved forward and evolved since the Spice Girls heyday. And what with the recent revisiting of nineties music and fashion trends – we’ve all been reminded that the decade will not be remembered as a great time for us chicks. Women were at best, ornamental, and at worst, invisible. The Spice Girls career in pictures That said I do have some very fond memories of female fronted acts and performers during that era. The Spice Girls may have been out front, but I also loved Kenickie, Fluffy, PJ Harvey and Republica. They had more of an impact on me than the parade of sub-Oasis jumped up boy bands with guitars and goatees. But if history refuses to remember or even properly recognise the greatest girl bands of the nineties, it’s not empowering to revisit that period, even if you were in the one band who did manage to establish a high profile pop legacy. As a pop fan, I love watching the growing group of awesome, visible women who are dominating the charts and all of our conversations. Rihanna, Beyonce, Nicki, Miley, Taylor, Little Mix, Lady Gaga and FKA Twigs are in our ears and on our minds, talking about modern womanhood and forcing us to have some difficult conversations about feminism, the roles we have to play within it and what we need from our female icons. Why would we want to go back to a time when headline-grabbing ‘pop feminism’ involved flicking a v sign, flashing your buttocks and claiming Margaret Thatcher was the first ambassador of Girl Power ?

Photo: AP Photo/Emile Wamsteker In the two decades that have passed since the dawn of the Spice Girls, we’ve all grown up. ‘Girl Power’ isn’t an empowering message for me or the women I know. It never was really. It’s just another empty nineties catchphrase, like ‘Whassupppp?’ or ‘Cowabunga!’ The Spice Girls didn’t offer their fans any real messages about how to endure struggles, find strength or work out how to be an independent woman and escape all the expectations placed upon you. The group’s lyrics like “friendship never ends,” might promote the idea of putting your mates before boys. But Victoria Beckham is doing something radical by putting herself before her pals and focusing on her present or future instead of pretending to still be interested in an imperfect past. We’ve moved on without the Spice Girls, and the Spice Girls need to move on without each other. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telewonderwomen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:36:46.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
