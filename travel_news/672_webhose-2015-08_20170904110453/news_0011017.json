Bargaining began last spring, and teachers had previously given their union authorization to call a strike.\nThe nearly 600-member association will hold a ratification meeting Thursday. Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 9.\nThe union said no details will be released before Thursday’s vote, and the same is true in Highline and Renton, where teachers will vote Monday on tentative contract agreements, approval of which would clear the way for Renton schools to start Tuesday, and Highline schools to start Thursday for first- through 12th-graders and Sept. 9 for kindergartners.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time In Auburn, the teachers union and the school district reached a tentative agreement this week, according to Auburn Education Association President Dianne Jordan. A union vote is set next week; school is to start Sept. 9.\nIn Seattle, bargaining continued Friday. The teachers union has authorized a strike vote for Thursday if a tentative agreement isn’t reached by that time. Classes are scheduled to start six days later, Sept. 9.\n“Things aren’t progressing well,” Seattle Education Association President Jonathan Knapp said at a rally Thursday. “It’s been slow and difficult.”\nAccording to the union, the two sides remain far apart on several issues, including instructional time and pay increases. Union members picketed on Interstate 5 overpasses last week to support the bargaining team and held a rally Thursday at Leschi Elementary for the union’s proposal of having 45 minutes of guaranteed recess for elementary students.\nThe first day of school in Everett hasn’t been set because the calendar is part of the negotiations, which are still ongoing in that district, according to Everett Public Schools. The Everett Education Association and school district will be talking through the weekend.\nIn Franklin County, Pasco educators also will be negotiating with the district through the weekend to try to come to an agreement by Monday. If the two sides don’t reach a tentative agreement, members will take a strike vote later that afternoon, Pasco Association of Educators President Greg Olson said Friday.\nPaige Cornwell: 206-464-2530 or pcornwell@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:35:50.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
