How terrifying. Source: Reddit \nRIDING a rollercoaster is scary enough without then having your dad plaster your moment of sheer terror all over the internet for the world to see. \nBut that’s exactly what happened to 12-year-old thrillseeker Kylan McKittrick, who had been riding the Skyrush rollercoaster, at Hershey Park in Pennsylvania, US, with his family when the cringe-worthy photo was taken. \nHis amused father Will Poole shared the snap on Reddit , along with the caption: “This roller coaster photo will haunt my son forever”. \nHelpfully, he also included a photo of how his son usually looks, and it’s a dramatic difference. Kylan McKittrick pictured before and during the ride, which hits a top speed of 122km/h. Source: Reddit \nThe photo has also made its way on Imgur, and overall it has been viewed more than half a million times. \nComments have ranged from those suggesting he needs an exorcism, to those criticising the father for “shaming” his son publicly. \n•“He looks like Luke Skywalker lol.” \n•“Kid’s gonna grow up and destroy a death star or something now.”. \n•“As an Atheist: I NEED JESUS AND HOLY WATER RIGHT NOW.” \n•“I don’t want to alarm you, but I THINK your child has melted a little.” \n•“It wouldn’t have haunted him until you posted it on the internet for all to see for the rest of his life ...” \nBut according to his dad, Kylan is loving the attention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T13:17:07.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
