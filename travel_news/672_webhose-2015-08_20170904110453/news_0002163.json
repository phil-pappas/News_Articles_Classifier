For the past year, Mallory has worked with CrowdRise to launch fundraising efforts that change lives overnight. CrowdRise's goal in working with Mallory is to inspire others to give back in a meaningful and impactful way. So far the initiative has been wildly successful in helping people in Haiti , Mexico , Nepal and, most recently, Detroit . Last Wednesday, Mallory's fundraising efforts culminated in a massive celebration at the new home of Detroit's CommuniD BBQ. For eight years, the nonprofit group Elevate Detroit has hosted a BBQ for the homeless in downtown Detroit . The event provided neighbors, homeless, and volunteers a sense of community and connectedness. When Mallory learned the BBQ was losing its location due to property restructuring, she knew this was the perfect cause for her next CrowdRise fundraiser. Mallory is CrowdRise's first sponsored fundraiser. With CrowdRise's support, she travels to communities around the world and spends 24 hours raising funds to help individuals in need. She then has 24 hours to implement the funds. The project is filmed in real time, giving donors the experience of watching their money make an immediate impact. \"We built CrowdRise for people like Mallory and the communities she's helping,\" said Founder and CEO Robert Wolfe . \"Companies like Patagonia do an incredible job supporting their aspirational adventurers. We want to do the same for aspirational fundraisers. Mallory's relentless passion and determination to make real change is inspiring and infectious. It's what CrowdRise is all about.\"Brown launched the campaign, 86,402 Seconds in Detroit last Tuesday. By that afternoon, she had surpassed her $10,000 goal and by the following day, she'd raised an additional $15,000 . With over 470 donors, 19 fundraisers and help from Sachse Construction, Detroit Mower Gang, Wasmer Bros, and Casey Sign Company, Mallory was able to create a home for the community event.
