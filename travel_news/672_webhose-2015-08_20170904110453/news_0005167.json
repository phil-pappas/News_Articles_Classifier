If approved, new prices will come into effect starting September, following their publication in the official newspaper La Gaceta.\nIf implemented, the price cut could come on top of another cut — ₡4.74 per liter — in gas prices requested in July in order to return to the public ₡1,109 million ($2 million) spent improperly . ARESEP has yet to approve the cut.\nARESEP is also studying a possible reduction in bus fares that would lower fares nationwide by 4.4 percent on average.\nThe decrease corresponds to the evaluation of bus fares the agency performs in January and July each year. The proposal on new fares also will be submitted for consultation at a public hearing and if approved new rates would apply starting October.\nThe regulatory agency every six months evaluates possible variations in bus fares taking into account variables such as gas prices, salaries, bus maintenance costs and other administrative costs. The agency stated on its website that “reductions in per-liter prices of diesel recorded in recent months could favor the decrease in bus fares.”\nIf approved, bus tariffs would decrease from ₡5 to ₡15 on about 50 percent of the country’s routes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:08:34.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
