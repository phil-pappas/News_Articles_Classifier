The foundation raised more than $270,000 during MPI’s 2015 World Education Congress (WEC) in San Francisco, exceeding the $170,000 raised during WEC last year. . \nThe MPI Foundation held three fundraisers during WEC 2015, including The Big Deal, an official World Series of Poker satellite tournament; the Not-So-Silent Auction; and Rendezvous, the foundation’s signature networking event. All of the proceeds will go towards the MPI Foundation Education Endowment, which provides chapter grants and scholarships to MPI members. In total, the MPI Foundation has distributed nearly $1 million in scholarships, grants, and research since January 2014. This includes 22 chapter grants and 75 scholarships for members throughout MPI’s global community. So far this calendar year, the foundation has funded 6 chapter grants and 91 scholarships and there are more opportunities available. “The MPI Foundation is thrilled by the support we received at WEC 2015,” said Stephen Revetria, chairman of the board for the MPI Foundation. “The contributions received will allow us to give even more to our members next year.” Upcoming fundraising events include the MPI Foundation’s Canada Rocks, which serves as the opening night reception for IncentiveWorks, in Toronto on August 17, 2015, and Rendezvous, the IMEX America Night in Las Vegas on October 14, 2015. Another way to support the foundation in the U.S. is through its Text To Give program and it involves simply texting the letters “MPIF” to 80888 to make a $10.00 donation that will be billed to each donor’s wireless carrier. In addition, Giants Enterprises will match every individual contribution made via the MPI Foundation’s Text To Give and Mobile Giving programs up to a total of $50,000 a year for the next three years.
