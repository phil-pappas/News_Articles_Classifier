But calm it is not. \nThe major landmarks in the Jewish, Muslim and Christian quarters recall the ancient violence that took place here - the destruction of the Jewish Temples, the crucifixion of Jesus, the massacres of the Crusaders - and the multi-language cacophony of chatter in cramped alleyways and the pushy locals can make even the most spiritual visit unnerving. \nTourists ride a camel at an observation point overlooking Jerusalem's Old City on the Mount of Olives.

The quietest quarter is the Armenian, and there too you'll find reminders of their century-old genocide. \nIf you are looking for a place to soak in the past and present in a more relaxed manner, though, your best bet may be on the picturesque balcony atop the Notre Dame of Jerusalem Centre. \nThere, just across from the New Gate into the Old City, you can finally enjoy some quiet and peacefully take in the magnificence of the city below. \nThe Dome of the Rock (L) is seen in the background on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount, in Jerusalem's Old City. Photo REUTERS Ad Feedback \nA glass of wine helps, and the breezy rooftop wine and cheese restaurant there offers a variety of (albeit pricey) options. \nStraddling the invisible line between east and west Jerusalem, it offers an elevated view of the adjacent holy sites like the Dome of the Rock and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre beyond the Old City walls. \nWith a nearly panoramic view of Jerusalem you can also get a glimpse of Ramallah to the north, Bethlehem to the south and, on a clear day, Jericho and the road to Jordan to the east. \nThe building itself is also of interest and provides a quiet alternative to the hectic streets outside. \nBuilt by the French Assumptionists from 1884 to 1904, the pontifical institute at Notre Dame has been one of the most significant Catholic pilgrim centres in the Holy Land. \nAdministered by the Vatican, it is now also an exclusive guest house for people of all faiths. Pope Francis stayed there last year during his visit to the Holy Land. \nYou don't have to be the pope though to enjoy a bird's eye view of one of the top tourist destinations in the world - without the intensity of having to navigate it yourself. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T12:55:13.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
