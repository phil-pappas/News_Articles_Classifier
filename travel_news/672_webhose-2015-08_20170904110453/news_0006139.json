It enjoys an excellent location, situated in one of the largest business districts of Paris, surrounded by famous tourist destinations and close to the Galeries Lafayette. The hotel’s elegant and sumptuously appointed rooms and suites are enhanced by the aristocratic architecture and the unique French setting. \nBuilt in 1862 by Napoleon III, its history is inherently tied to that of Paris, and the hotel has always played a major role in the promotion and preservation of French history and culture. Since 2007, the InterContinental Paris le Grand has been actively engaged in all aspects of sustainability, focusing on environmental and social contributions. \nGreen Globe congratulates the InterContinental Paris le Grand on its inaugural certification in June this year. This achievement highlights the dedication demonstrated by management and staff towards sustainable management and operations. \nChristophe Laure, General Manager at the InterContinental Paris le Grand and Area General Manager Paris said, “We are very proud to be certified by Green Globe. Our commitment goes beyond a simple commitment because all our staff support this approach. So, we strive every day to be a responsible, fair and efficient hotel.” \nThe hotel works with Green Engage, IHG’s in-house global sustainability program to devise green strategies that encompass the hotel’s overall management and operations. The IHG Green Engage online system measures energy, waste and water use. This information is then used by hotel management to set reduction targets for each area. \nIn a recent interview for Green Globe, Mr. Laure pointed out that when arranging conferences or events, organizers are consistently requesting environmentally friendly options. The hotel can reassure meeting planners that through working with IHG resource management, and adhering to Green Globe standards, an overall responsibility to sustainable practices is maintained. \nThe hotel’s commitment to caring for French heritage is evidenced in the recent renovations to its Grand Ballroom, which opened in 1862. Local artisans completed the renovation to the Ballrooom’s priceless architecture and design, while also ensuring the lowest possible impacts on the environment and incorporating the use of certified suppliers. \nThe InterContinental Paris le Grand and staff are also actively involved in community activities as part of their social responsibilities. All staff participate in fund raising activities for the Mecenat Chirurgie Cardiaque (Heart Surgery Charity). This organization supports children with heart conditions from underprivileged countries with operations performed in France when they cannot be treated at home due to a lack of financial or technological means. In addition, a homestay family arrangement is also organized during the children’s stay in France. \nMr. Laure concludes, “All InterContinental Paris le Grand staff including myself have a role to play in ensuring that steps are taken for future generations to be more aware of their sustainable responsibilities.” \nAbout Green Globe Certification \nGreen Globe is the worldwide sustainability system based on internationally-accepted criteria for sustainable operation and management of travel and tourism businesses.
