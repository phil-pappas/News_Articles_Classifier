The human rights court ordered the Costa Rican government to attend a hearing on Sept. 3 to explain the country’s lack of progress on the issue. Costa Rica has missed several deadlines to regulate the procedure since the 2012 ruling by the San José-based rights court.\nDuring a press conference Tuesday, Alfaro reiterated the Solís administration’s support for IVF legalization and gay rights protection in response to a question about a large march in downtown San José by social conservatives opposed to both:\nThe administration will not allow any new condemnations against this country in regards to this issue [IVF]. For the country, respect for international judicial organizations is absolutely essential. For a country like Costa Rica without an army, a country that dedicates a large part of its foreign policy in international law, it’s vital to respect the ruling of international judicial bodies.\nMajor legislative victories were largely absent from this extraordinary session, the month-long period when the executive branch sets the Assembly’s agenda, but Casa Presidencial spun it as a success. According to a statement from Casa Presidencial, 36 of its 77 bills “advanced” and five reached the plenary for debate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:28:40.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
