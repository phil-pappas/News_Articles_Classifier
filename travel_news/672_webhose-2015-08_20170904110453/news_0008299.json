Two runners up will receive €2,000 cash. All three will be invited to present their ideas at a conference in Lisbon in September. \nLGBT tourists are a hugely important part of the $1.5 trillion tourist economy, spending over $200 billion annually,” said Carlos Kytka, Geta’s executive director. \n“If we are going to enhance their experience and improve the facilities and services offered to them we need to have good data so that companies and destinations can make evidence- based improvements.” \nThe competition is part of Geta’s Promoting Innovation in LGBT Tourism programme, which has already seen initiatives such as the launch of Europe’s first LGBT language school holidays and partnering with the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office to provide official safety guidance to LGBT travellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:42:12.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
