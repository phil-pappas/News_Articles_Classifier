Local artist Kit Wohl curated this display to allow locals, hotel guests and tourists to look into the bright future of New Orleans and reflect on how the city has thrived since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The installation is part of the hotel’s continuous reinvestment in New Orleans and the revitalization of Canal Street and will be on display through October.\nThe Ritz-Carlton New Orleans art installationThe installation in the previously underutilized gallery windows is a collection of mirrors from various sources with gold decals on the windowpanes to read “Reflections of Recovery.”\nWohl and The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans team’s intention is to invite people to interact with the display and reflect on the recovery of the city while looking into what the future holds.\n“What better than an installation of mirrors as plain and as fanciful as the city, as reflections of recovery?” said artist Kit Wohl.“The extent of which this city has thrived since the largest natural disaster in the U.S. is something to celebrate. New Orleanians and its visitors are the reason this city recovered and is now stronger than ever, which makes this display that reflects these heroes so terrific,” said Jim Oliver, The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans General Manager.\nSource:-Ritz-Carlton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T07:59:10.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
