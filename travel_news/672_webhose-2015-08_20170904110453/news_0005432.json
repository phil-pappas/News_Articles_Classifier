Her parents can't bear the thought of visiting, but she has always wanted to see the fabulous Bharat Mata since I gave her a Saraswati murti when she was about 7. She learned the Saraswati mantra I found on the net at the time and can still recite it, so has convert potential! I am an India-phile and have spent a lot of time travelling the country over the years, so am happy and also slightly scared to take her for an introductory trip. She'll be armed with a wooden stick naturally. My problem is I have only two to three weeks to perform this task (!), so where to go this autumn, maybe including Diwali? My view is that if you want to get an inkling re India, head for the ghats at Benares and take in the scene. I tend to like spiritual & chilled India - Bodhgaya, Amritsar GT, Hampi, Gokarna, Sri Meenakshi, Rishikesh, Kausani, Himalayas, festivals (was at 2001 Maha Kumbh) ... Not been in the middle so much and would like to see Orchcha, Sanchi, Mandu, Ajanta, Ellora, Ujjain ... realise this is almost un-doable in the time I have. Sure there's plenty I don't know about too. Dongria Kondh? Tigers? Any recommendations out there (would really like to include Benares)? Flying in/out from UK.
