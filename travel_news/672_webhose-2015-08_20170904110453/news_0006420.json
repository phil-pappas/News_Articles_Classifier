There is an additional $125 service charge for each stopover of more than four hours within the U.S. or more than 24 hours outside of the U.S.\nA pet traveling in cabin must be carried in an approved hard-sided or soft-sided kennel. The kennel must fit completely under the seat in front of the customer and remain there at all times.\nThe maximum dimensions for hard-sided kennels are 17.5 inches long x 12 inches wide x 7.5 inches high (44 cm x 30 cm x 19 cm). The recommended maximum dimensions for soft-sided kennels are 18 inches long x 11 inches wide x 11 inches high (46 cm x 28 cm x 28 cm).\nSoft-sided pet carriers may exceed these dimensions slightly, as they are collapsible and able to conform to under-seat space without blocking the aisle.\nWith the exception of birds, there may only be one pet per kennel, and the animal must be able to stand up and turn around comfortably. Two birds may travel in the same kennel.\nTaken from United Airlines' website\nThe officer continues: 'The captain is requesting that you get off the flight so you'll need to take your dog with you.'\nThe woman then says she wants her money back first, to which the officer says that needs to be sorted once off the plane.\n'This is the worst aeroplane I've ever been on,' she says before the policeman tells her she is 'holding up the whole plane.'\n'I don't care, you're holding me up,' shouts the woman.\nThe passenger is warned she will go to jail if she continues, to which she replies: 'I'm not going to go to jail mister, you're looking to the wrong lady.'\nThe officer then reaches down to collect the dog, which leads the woman to screech out in anger.\n'This is my dog and I'm going to sue this country,' she yells.\nThe woman is then physically restrained before being led off the flight, and she is followed out by a man who was seated next to her as the action unfolded.\nShe can be clearly heard screeching, screaming and swearing as she is led off onto the tarmac and into the terminal.\nA spokesperson for United Airlines told MailOnline Travel: 'SkyWest flight 6227, operating as United Express from Salt Lake City to Chicago, returned to the gate after a passenger refused to comply with safety rules regarding in-flight transportation of pets.\n'The passenger was removed by local law enforcement, and the flight continued to Chicago.'\nThe passenger later says that the plane was 'the worst she had ever been on'\nThe scene takes a worrying turn and the woman is then forcibly ejected from the aircraft\nRead more: Traveling with In-Cabin Pets | United Airlines", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1WwejK3", "http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/animals/in_cabin.aspx"], "published": "2015-08-16T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T20:55:54.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
