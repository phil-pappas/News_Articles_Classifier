That's to say the heavens have opened.\nEveryone is drenched or wandering around in those ill-fitting RNLI poncho-come-binbag things that they've had to buy in a hurry to keep the rain off and their iPhones dry.\nOr they are running to the nearest indoor ride to seek shelter and the cafes dotted around the park are filling up with refugees from the wet to point out patches of blue sky they are sure they can see in the foreboding grey above them.\nFamily room: Thomas Land has expanded to include five VIP rooms above its new Sodor Airport complex\nWatery fun: The expansion includes Captain's Sea Adventure, which features six rotating lifeboat carriages armed with water cannons with which you can squirt water at those in the queues and other riders\nBut for a few visitors to the park there is a silver lining. And for those people this is a Really Useful innovation.\nDrayton Manor is the host of Europe's only Thomas The Tank Engine theme park. And this year the Staffordshire park celebrated its 65th year of operation (and changeable weather) by nearly doubling the size of Thomas Land.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Inside Britain's Beach Hut of the Year (and it's a quick... Over 60% of Brits return from holiday disappointed, reveals... The humble package holiday's surprisingly upper-class... Astonishing moment brave pilot turns the engines off and... Rare photographs show the fascinating early days of London's... Sitting atop the rides are five VIP suites which families and their friends can use for the whole day.\nJust steps from all the attractions it provides a bolt-hole to escape the weather and the cacophonous chaos of the queues, the incessant demands for toys and the refrains of 'again' and 'just one more ride'.\nOn the day my family visited it was not only a great place to dry off but when you're with three young bundles of energy and all their accouterments, it's a welcoming place to just take a break, repack supplies (where did that dummy go?).\nThomas Land brings to life that famous old engine for children (and adults) to enjoy (file photo of Thomas on a special run through Llangollen Steam Railway station)\nThe rooms are spacious - at least for the five of us - and are decorated with scenes from Thomas' island of Sodor (my two-year-old daughter has fallen in love with all of the Sodor engines, all of whom make her laugh whenever she sees them).\nThere are bean bags for the children to crash around on and more grown-up arm chairs for adults to rest their weary legs after zinging around the attractions.\nIn the morning you are greeted with some refreshments - pastries, fruit platter, tea, coffee and a few soft drinks - which allows you time to get the map out and plan the day's activities. And they are there for you whenever you want to take a break.\nThe room can be used by up to 10 people for £250 and it is £500 for 20 (the prices vary depending on demand and whether in peak or off-season). When split between 10 and faced with an exhausting day walking around the rides, £25 each can seem like a wise investment, as long as you can resist then blowing even more on toys and food.\nUp and away: The expansion has seen the number of rides in Thomas Land rise by 40pc including Jeremy Jet's Flying Academy (pictured)\nNearly twice the fun: The opening of the new attractions earlier this year, supplementing some old favourites\nFor those with a little bit more spare cash but not enough time or money to stay at the Drayton Manor Park Hotel a few minutes' walk away from the main gates, it is an ideal middle ground.\nHaving that extra luxury allows you to ensure that you can have a base, so you can ensure you enjoy your day (tantrums excluded) - and make the trip and gate fee all the more worth it.\nOf course, the target audience for the rooms (even though they really do provide a port in a fun storm during a long day out) are families with little Thomas fans celebrating their birthdays.\nYou can request a meet and greet with the Fat Controller (and yes Drayton Manor hasn't given in to the politically-correct lobby and changed his name) and even get the park to make a birthday cake.\nThat'd make for some great nursery or playground bragging rights.\nThe rooms themselves are above the new Sodor Airport Complex. The expansion has taken the number of rides in Thomas Land to 25.\nMy children, who range between two and seven, found them all thrilling from the new Flynn the Fire Engine ride, equipped with on-board hoses to Captain's Sea Adventure, which features six rotating lifeboat carriages armed with water cannons with which you can aim at those in the queues and other riders.\nNone of the children were scared or felt threatened by any of the rides in Thomas Land as the ones outside that are aimed more at older children or adults - even though my adrenalin-junkie five-year-old son made his not-so-strong-stomached father ride with him on the Ben 10 rocket ride no less than six times (rain = no queues you see).\nRather, as with Thomas the Tank Engine itself, which harks back to a more genteel, bygone age, my children's favourites were the old classics.\nThere is nothing as satisfying as a trip on Thomas with the family through the park from Knapford station.\nTRAVEL FACTS Thomas Land VIP suites start from just £250 for up to ten guests and £500 for up to 20 guests based on off-peak dates and will vary during peak season.\nTickets to Drayton Manor Park, including Thomas Land, are not included with the VIP experience and are £65 for a family of four if booked more than seven days in advance.\nA meet and greet with the fat controller is available for £25 and will include a signed photograph with the man himself and the family. A birthday cake supplied by Drayton Manor will cost £25.
