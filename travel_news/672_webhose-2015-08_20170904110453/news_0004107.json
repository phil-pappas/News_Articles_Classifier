That October, the World Series was enjoyed by a nation at peace for the first time since December 7, 1941 . While most star players were still overseas and some wartime rules remained in effect, the game marked a much-needed return to normalcy for Americans. The Detroit Tigers ultimately triumphed over the Chicago Cubs four games to three- in large part due to the play of honorably discharged slugger Hank Greenberg .\nOn August 19, 2015 , the two teams will face off again, sporting throwback jerseys and benefiting The National WWII Museum-an institution that honors heroes like Greenberg who served their country in its darkest hour of need. The Museum's Victory Belles, an Andrews Sisters-style singing trio, will be on hand to sing the National Anthem, complete with a military flyover. Veterans will be honored for their service during the game. Fans will also have the opportunity to support the Museum's mission through text-to-give.\nThe festivities celebrating this historic matchup are a result of the Museum's national board of trustees, which includes Cubs owner Todd Ricketts , Chicago businessman Jeff Carter and Detroit businessman Mike Bylen .\n\"World War II permeated every sector of life, including our national pastime,\" said Bylen, a Museum Trustee since 2010. \"This game supports the Museum's mission to educate the American people about the heroes of the war, and celebrate the generations of extraordinary veterans who have courageously fought so we can enjoy events as ordinary as a baseball game. Our wish is that after the final out, 41,000 people will leave Wrigley Field with a deeper appreciation for the greatest generation, and become new ambassadors of the Museum's mission.\"\nMuseum President & CEO Dr. Gordon \"Nick\" Mueller will be on hand along with a number of Museum board and former board members, including WWII veterans.\n\"Since opening our doors in 2000, the Museum has had broad public appeal. The personal stories and objects make the war real to our visitors,\" said Mueller. \"Baseball is a central part of that American story too, the players who left behind big salaries to serve and the men and women who stepped up to keep our national pastime going for everyone at home.\"\nIn 2007, the Museum presented the special exhibit When Baseball Went to War as well as a baseball-themed conference attended by WWII veterans and former players Bob Feller , Dom DiMaggio, Morrie Martin , Johnny Pesky, Jerry Coleman , Lou Brissie and Herb \"Briefcase\" Simpson , as well as modern-day legends Tommy Lasorda and Curt Schilling .\nTickets for the retro-themed game are available at www.cubs.com . Those who cannot attend still have the opportunity to text 1945 to 41444 to support The National WWII Museum and help preserve the stories of the Greatest Generation.\nThe National WWII Museum tells the story of the American experience in the war that changed the world â€“ why it was fought, how it was won, and what it means today. Dedicated in 2000 as The National D-Day Museum and now designated by Congress as America's National WWII Museum, it celebrates the American Spirit, the teamwork, optimism, courage and sacrifice of the men and women who served on the battlefront and the Home Front.
