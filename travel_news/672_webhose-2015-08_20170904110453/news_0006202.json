He told The Associated Press that the injured American was Spencer Stone of the Sacramento area and the other was Alek Skarlatos of Roseburg, Oregon.\n“We heard a gunshot, and we heard glass breaking behind us, and saw a train employee sprint past us down the aisle,” Sadler said from France, describing the drama. Then, they saw a gunman entering the train car with an automatic rifle, he said.\nMost Read Stories Interactive map of wildfires in the U.S. Thousands in state wrestle to tame relentless infernos Washington wildfires rage; Obama declares state of emergency Firefighters killed near Twisp: ‘three big heroes protecting small towns’ How to help — and 9 other things to know about the wildfires “As he was cocking it to shoot it, Alek just yells, ‘Spencer, go!’ And Spencer runs down the aisle,” Sadler said. “Spencer makes first contact, he tackles the guy, Alek wrestles the gun away from him, and the gunman pulls out a box cutter and slices Spencer a few times. And the three of us beat him until he was unconscious.”\nAnother passenger helped tie the gunman up, and Stone then helped another passenger who had been wounded in the throat and losing blood, Sadler said.\n“The gunman never said a word,” he added.\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said it “can only confirm that one U.S. military member was injured in the incident. The injury is not life-threatening.”\nThe White House issued a statement saying that President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, and said, “While the investigation into the attack is in its early stages, it is clear that their heroic actions may have prevented a far worse tragedy.”\nThe suspect is a 26-year-old Moroccan, according to Sliman Hamzi, an official with the Alliance police union, who spoke on French television i-Tele.\nStone is with the Air Force stationed in the Azores and Skarlotos, a 22-year-old National Guardsman, had returned from a deployment in Afghanistan in July, according to Skarlotos’ step-mother Karen Skarlotos.\nShe spoke with her step-son immediately after the incident. “He sounded fine, but he was intense — he sounded like he had just thwarted a terrorist attack.”\n“Alek and Spencer, they’re big, brave, strong guys and they decided they were going to tackle him. And they did. Spencer tackled him, and Alek took the gun and clobbered him a good one,” she told the AP from Oregon. “Spencer got a couple good slices on him. But they were able to subdue him while the train was still moving.”\nAuthorities met them at the next station as the train doors opened, she said.\nPhilippe Lorthiois, an official with the Alliance police union, said the attacker did not fire his automatic weapon but wounded one man with a handgun and the other with a blade of some kind.\nInvestigators from France’s special anti-terror police are leading the investigation, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor’s office said.\n“As always where an act that could be terrorist in nature is involved, the greatest care and the greatest precision will be used,” Cazeneuve said.\nCazeneuve said the Americans “were particularly courageous and showed great bravery in very difficult circumstances” and that “without their sangfroid we could have been confronted with a terrible drama.”\nA third person, French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, suffered a minor injury while activating the train’s emergency alarm, Lorthiois said.\nPassenger Christina Cathleen Coons of New York described the drama in car 12 of the train in an interview with Ouest France newspaper.\n“I heard shots, most likely two, and a guy collapsed,” she is Quote: d as saying.\nCoons, identified as a 28-year-old vacationing in Europe, said a window broke above one woman’s head. “A guy fell to the floor and had blood everywhere,” she is Quote: d as saying.\nShe described lying on the floor herself and taking photos with her phone.\nThe attack took place at 1545 GMT while the Thalys train was passing through Belgium, according to a statement from the office President Francois Hollande.

Passengers on those trains must pass through a metal detector and have their bags scanned as well.\nThalys is owned by the French and Belgian railways and operates high-speed trains serving Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne, Germany.\nFrench authorities have been on heightened alert since Islamic extremist attacks in January left 20 people dead, including the three attackers.
