(AP) -- It's another one for the record books in Asheville. Tourism officials tell local media outlets that 2014 again set records for tourism in the area. Officials say an estimated 10 million visitors flocked to Asheville during 2014 and spent an estimated $1.7 billion. That surpasses the figures set in 2013. The local Convention and Visitor's Bureau is also running a new $600,000 ad campaign to lure visitors. The effort includes television ads that are running in the Carolinas as well as in Tennessee and Ohio. Print and online ads also appear in the eastern United States and some will appear nationally. The theme of the campaign is \"Asheville, Discovery inside and out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T06:05:13.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
