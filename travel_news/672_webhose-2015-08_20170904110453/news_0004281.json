The island holds a special place in the hearts of the French, who associate it with carefree seaside holidays. Less self-consciously cool than the Île de Ré , it maintains the air of a well-kept secret – though it’s anything but that in August. Sandy beaches backed by pines, dazzling salt pans and whitewashed buildings with blue shutters lend a Mediterranean air, despite the bracing Atlantic location. The food, as you’d expect, is fabulous.\nWhat to do \nMost people come here to indulge in the simple seaside pastimes of rock pooling, digging for clams and bobbing around in dinghies. Plage des Dames is a glorious sweep of powder-soft sand with a promenade, wooden pier and pretty beach huts. Stroll through the Bois de la Chaize, a shady forest of oak, pine and eucalyptus trees. The terrain is flat so most people get around by bike, or you can catch the little tourist train that runs around the island.\nWhere to stay \nL’ Île Ô Château is a smart family-run hotel with 23 bedrooms which have recently been kitted out with driftwood headboards, seagrass flooring and a black-and-white colour scheme. There’s a small pool and bike hire is available. Doubles are priced from £60 ( ileochateau.com ). \nWhere to eat \nLe Velo Noir is a tiny side-street bistro which makes good use of the local seafood – oysters, sea bream ceviche and fried cuttlefish with olives – and the island’s famed potatoes which even pop up on the dessert menu in the unexpected form of a potato cake with salted caramel sauce ( levelonoir.fr ).\nInsider tip \nClaire Osterburg of Wake Up in France ( wakeupinfrance.co.uk ) which offers accommodation in the Vendée, recommends taking a trip round the island on O’Abandonado, a Portuguese tall ship ( oabandonado.com ). “It’s a little piece of sailing history, and you can even hoist the sails yourself.”\nGive me a break\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Peace and quiet: bedding down for the night in a church. Home: bedding down in the aisle Go bat hunting before bedding down for the night in the aisle of a 13th-century church.

Packages from £45 (£25 for under-16s) including B&B in the church (visitchurches.org.uk).\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Canary Island hideaway: Eco Finca de los Frailes, Lanzarote.
