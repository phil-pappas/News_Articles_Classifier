Gov. Mark Hutchison announced.\nThe Global Tourism Summit is the evolution of the long-running Governor’s Conference on Tourism, and will take place at the Hilton Lake Las Vegas on November 16-17.\nAccording to the World Tourism Organization destinations worldwide received some 332 million international tourists between January and April 2015, 14 million more than the same period last year, an increase of 4 percent. By region, the Americas (+6 percent) led growth, followed by Europe, Asia and the Pacific and the Middle East.\n“Our sophisticated tourism industry demands a stronger focus on international marketing, and that’s why we have evolved the annual tourism conference to focus entirely on the global market,” Hutchison, chair of the Nevada Commission on Tourism, said. “Gov. Sandoval has made a point throughout his tenure as governor to keep Nevada competitive by looking forward and moving nimbly with the changing business landscape, and this is perhaps no more evident than in the tourism industry.”\nChristopher Thompson, president/CEO of Brand USA, has been at the helm of developing international marketing programmes for Brand USA, the nation’s public-private partnership dedicated to increasing international visitation to the United States through marketing and promotional efforts. Thompson is also responsible for accelerating the organization’s efforts to build and execute effective marketing strategies to increase U.S. travel exports, create jobs, strengthen the economy, and help enhance the image of the United States among people all over the world.\n“TravelNevada has been working in the international marketing arena for more than a decade with representative offices in nine international markets, most recently expanding into India,” Claudia Vecchio, director of the Nevada Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs, said. “International travelers visit every corner of Nevada; our goal is to ensure statewide partners understand how to promote their product and effectively welcome visitors from diverse cultures.”\nThis year the popular Nevada Marketplace is expected to expand with a record 10 countries represented, including India for the first time. This is an opportunity for Nevada travel suppliers to meet international buyers – tour operators, receptive operators, wholesalers, online travel agents, and airlines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:26:18.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
