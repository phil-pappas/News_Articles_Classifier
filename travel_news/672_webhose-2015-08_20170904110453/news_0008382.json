While Jane spirals downward into depression and is considering suicide, she finds a book about Costa Rica whose images inspire her to take an end-of-life-journey to Central America, as Jane thinks that dying in Costa Rica might be the best thing she can do.\nIn Costa Rica, Jane meets a young guide named Juan (Jaenada), who shows her the profound meaning of the essential Costa Rican saying “ pura vida ” (“pure life”) as they embark on an adventure through beautiful Costa Rican sights and experiences. Will they be enough to change Jane’s plans to end it all in paradise? Only time will tell.\nCosta Rican scenery provides the perfect background of the love story. Filming locations inclueded Manuel Antonio National Park, Portasol Living eco-community south of Manuel Antonio, Quepos, the Tárcoles River, and, on the Caribbean Coast, Puerto Viejo and Tortuguero.\nGuillermo Piedra Gonzalez, Portasol Living eco-community General Director, when asked what it was like to meet and host Hollywood movie stars, said that “Oscar was really focused on his work. Marcia was really nice, down-to-earth and fun. She went into our kitchen when our cooks were making their lunch, and started talking to the ladies about their recipes. She said she would like to come back to Costa Rica with her kids. We welcome her back anytime!”\nPart of the film’s inspiration came out of the coffee-table book “Costa Rica: A Journey Through Nature,” by Adrian Hepworth, which is based on his 13 years of photography fieldwork in Costa Rica.\n“I have no doubt [this movie] will tempt visitors to come and experience Costa Rica for themselves,” Hepworth said in a statement.\nCheck out the trailer:", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZF1X_mYl80?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-08-21T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:39:03.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
