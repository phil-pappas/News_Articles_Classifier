The building's windows were blown out and its facade was left cracked and crumbling, while parts of a wall surrounding it were destroyed. \nOne of the two guard posts at the entrance of the building was also destroyed. \nA blackened car engine lay metres from the entrance and broken metal vehicle parts lay scattered on the ground. \n\"The front glass window of my apartment broke and two doors fell down. It was like an earthquake,\" Hady Gad, a resident living behind the building, told AFP. \nJihadists have killed scores of police and soldiers since the insurgency swelled in the wake of the overthrow of Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president who took office following the 2011 ouster of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. \nThey say the attacks are in retaliation for a police crackdown targeting Morsi supporters that has left hundreds dead and thousands jailed. Hundreds more have been sentenced to death after speedy trials. \nWhile most of the attacks have centred on Sinai, IS has in recent months carried out more attacks in the capital, including against foreign targets. \nThe group claimed a car bomb attack targeting the Italian consulate in downtown Cairo on July 11 which killed a passerby. \nThe consulate bombing was followed by the abduction of Croatian engineer Tomislav Salopek, who IS claimed to have beheaded in a statement released earlier this month with a purported picture of his corpse. \nWith his security forces struggling to contain the insurgency, Sisi on Sunday ratified an anti-terrorism law boosting police and judicial powers. It also imposes hefty fines for \"false\" media reports on militant attacks. \nRights groups, which have accused Sisi of imposing a repressive regime, fear the new law could be used to further muzzle dissent and target critics. \nThe passing of the law was expedited after state prosecutor Hisham Barakat was assassinated in a car bombing in June, followed by a large-scale jihadist attack in Sinai days later. \nThe judiciary and security forces already had wide-ranging powers in tackling \"terrorism\", and Sisi's regime has been accused of using the battle against jihadists as a pretext for stifling dissent. \nThe law \"increases authorities' power to impose heavy sentences, including the death penalty, for crimes under a definition of terrorism that is so broadly worded it could encompass civil disobedience,\" Human Rights Watch said Wednesday. \nThe foreign ministry has hit back at criticism, insisting that other countries should \"respect the independence of the (Egyptian) judiciary\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:14:51.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
