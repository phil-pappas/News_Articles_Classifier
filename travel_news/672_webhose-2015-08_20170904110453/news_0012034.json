The programme will also be open to accompanying family members. \n\n“The Ovation of the Seas has a capacity for more than 4,000 passengers, and we expect Nu Skin to fill it up,” Treacy said. \n\nHe shared that the Singapore-based sales team at Royal Caribbean International had courted Nu Skin for “several months” and the win was reflective of a “growing interest in MICE cruises here in South-east Asia”. \n\n“Cruises offer a variety of experiences and destinations for event delegates, and we are glad to be seeing more interest from corporate clients. We will (keep that interest growing by) participating in a MICE fair in Singapore come September, and keep our conversation with the trade going - we are talking to travel (consultants) on how they can develop their MICE business and educate them on what cruise has to offer corporate clients,” he added. \n\nOvation of the Seas , which is being built in Germany, is the latest ship in the Royal Caribbean International fleet. Its star attractions, which are subject to further updates, will for now include Ripcord by iFLY, an air machine that allows participants to experience the thrill of flying in a controlled environment; North Star, a capsule that ascends over 91m above the sea; and Seaplex and Two70°, which are venues that transform throughout the day to serve different purposes. \n\nThe vessel will be deployed for a number of programmes around Europe and Asia including a three-night round-trip out of Singapore to Malaysia’s Port Klang and from China’s Tianjin to Singapore over 12 nights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:12:42.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
