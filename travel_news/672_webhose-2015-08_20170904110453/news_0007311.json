Recently, Lloydshare Limited helped create a GoFundMe campaign in order to raise funds for a woman who barely survived a blood clot to the brain combined with a stroke. The campaign has already raised $1,270 of the $15,000 in just two days.\nAs an industry leader, Lloydshare Limited has many affiliates in Latin America. Deborah Euklund, the woman who suffered the stroke, was part of one such affiliate – La Tranquila Spa and Resort in Litibu, Mexico. According to Victoria Reindl, Business Development and Compliance Director for Lloydshare Limited, Euklund was driving home recently when she was struck with a debilitating headache that forced her to stop on the side of the road. She took an aspirin, but her headache quickly evolved into paralysis. Thankfully she received medical care in time, having been rushed to AMERIMED from Punta de Mita. A team of 10 doctors and nurses worked to save her life and succeeded.\nLloydshare Limited shares that Eukland’s convalescence will be long and costly. In fact, she has been billed $70,000 pesos by AMERIMED, $8,000 pesos for the ambulance transportation, and $6,300 pesos for medicine. She also anticipates another operation will be necessary to unblock her artery in addition to more post-care expenses.\n“There are moments in everyone's life when we or a friend needs a helping hand,” said Reindl. “We're asking people to consider donating to her fund to take some of the financial stress off and help her through this difficult time so she can focus all her energy on recovering and getting back to work.”\nLloydshare Limited is asking that people who are interested in helping Eukland through this difficult time visit http://www.gofundme.com/xf22uakc to make a donation. Donors can even leave behind words of encouragement on the GoFundMe page.\nLloydshare Limited was established in 2002. The company pioneered the concept of offering a vacation-ownership linked deferred annuity. Lloydshare Limited’s current portfolio of host resorts features more than 45 vacation ownership properties, with more and more resorts being added throughout Mexico, the Caribbean and Asia.\n###\ninfo(at)lloydshare(dot)com\nhttp://www.lloydshare.com/", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb2Z1bmRtZS5jb20veGYyMnVha2M=", "http://www.lloydshare.com/", "http://www.gofundme.com/xf22uakc", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmFjZWJvb2suY29tL2xsb3lkc2hhcmUubGltaXRlZA==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5sbG95ZHNoYXJlLmNvbS8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9sbG95ZHNoYXJl"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:46:47.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
