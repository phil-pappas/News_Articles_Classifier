The smooth sounds of a live saxophone punctuate the bass-heavy remix of Beyoncé hits blaring from the speakers. The musician in front of you seems lost in his instrument, while the 60 people surrounding you all move in synch. Are you in a jazz bar, a nightclub, a gym? It’s hard to tell, but one thing is clear: you’re very, very sweaty. Indoor cycling, or spinning, is nothing new. Enthusiasts have been singing its praises for decades. Most standard gyms hold their own spinning classes and several dedicated spin gyms have popped up around the country over the past few years. But spinning to live music? Now that’s a unique experience. Live sessions usually feature a saxophone player and/or bongo players – and they’re talented enough to make you forget that you’re working out If you’ve tried spinning but want an even more exciting ride, the bi-monthly live sessions at 1Rebel , a boutique fitness destination, are a brilliant way to spice up your routine. And if you’re completely new to spinning, why not start with one of the most fun options available? 1Rebel is based in the City of London, which means you’re in luck if you live in the capital. And if not, well, it’s worth scheduling in a ride during your next visit. Here are the top five reasons to give live music spinning a try. 1. It feels more like entertainment than exercise Live sessions usually feature a saxophone player and/or bongo players – and they’re talented enough to make you forget that you’re working out and just enjoy the show. 2. You'll always have a seat As you get older, the appeal of standing up for an entire gig starts to dwindle. But with 1Rebel, you know you’ll have a place to sit. 3. You'll burn loads of calories Going to hear live music often leads to drinking a few beers and consuming unneeded calories. Instead, you’ll be burning up to 800 calories in one 45-minute ride. 4. It's dark This means your fellow spinners likely won’t notice if you need to take a break or slow down for a bit. Plus, everyone is watching the musician – not judging their neighbours. 5. There's no thinking involved You don’t need to worry about what your next exercise should be or whether you should spend more time on a particular machine. Instead, you can just shut off your mind, mimic the instructor and enjoy the music. If you can’t fit one of the live music sessions into your diary, you can always try one of the other rides. They all feature upbeat soundtracks and they hold regular themed rides – from hip hop to garage to Kanye West vs Taylor Swift. The first ride is £10 and each additional ride is £20, with added discounts if you purchase one of 1Rebel’s packages.
