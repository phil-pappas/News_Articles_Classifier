But, when someone sends a professional video team with you and make a cool travel video with you as the center piece, you are totally blown away. I have to say that I feel insanely proud and happy to be the lead model/anchor/actor in this short travel video. I hope this is the start of many to come and hopefully, one day, you will see me on the TV and/or on other media. On this trip, I traveled by rail from Los Angeles to Washington DC visiting Los Angeles , Santa Monica , San Antonio , Austin , New Orleans , Baltimore and finally finishing the trip at Washington DC . It was a 12 day train journey from the West to the East Coast of the United States of America. I hope you get a whirlwind tour of this coast to coast journey through this short journey. I am yet to write the detailed story about this trip on the blog, but you can follow all my USA posts here as I have written quite a few on the blog. Or you can follow #DiscoverAmerica #MTPTrain #RoadTripUSA for more details. Thank you Brand USA and Discover America team for making this video on me!! You have been a great group to work with.
