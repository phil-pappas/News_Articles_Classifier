We deeply value the role of sponsors in supporting this platform for development.”\nWTM® Africa will be sponsoring the opening dinner of the conference, an informal evening featuring the best of food, drink and entertainment that the Garden Route has to offer. In addition, Carol Weaving, Managing Director of Thebe Reed, the organisers of WTM® Africa, will participate in a session on ‘The Future of Trade Shows in South Africa’. This panel discussion takes place on Friday, 14 August at 12h15.\nGeneral Manager of WTM® Africa, Chardonnay Marchesi says: “We are looking forward to being part of the SATSA 2015 Conference. A collaboration such as this allows us to work together in addressing current trends in the tourism industry and to further promote the effort achieved in the inbound sector, in making Southern Africa and Africa a marketable leisure destination.”\nThe three-day conference will review trends such as adventure tourism, responsible tourism, transformation and new approaches in conserving Africa’s wildlife. The prestigious keynote speaker as this year’s conference will be Minister of Tourism, Derek Hanekom.\nTaking place in Cape Town at the Cape Town International Convention Centre between 6 and 8 April 2016, WTM® Africa is the leading B2B exhibition for the inbound and outbound African travel & tourism markets.
