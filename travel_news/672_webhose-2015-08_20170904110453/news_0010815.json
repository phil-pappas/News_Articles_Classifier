British Airways' first operation of Flight 279 is scheduled to depart Heathrow at 3:15 p.m. (London time) land at 6:05 p.m. on May 6, 2016, in San Jose. The same aircraft is to depart San Jose at 8 p.m. that night and is scheduled into Heathrow at 2:05 p.m. (London time) the next day, the release said. The flight will use Terminal 5, according to a City of San Jose release , which will allow in-terminal connections to more than 130 cities in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia on the British Airways system. BA's seating configuration for the wide-bodied, twin-engine aircraft is eight passengers in its newly branded First cabin, 42 seats in Club World, 39 in World Traveller Plus and 127 in World Traveller. The 787 originally entered service in 2011 with All Nippon Airways , and was designed to burn 20 percent less fuel than the Boeing 767, which makes it economically viable in smaller international markets — what are known as \"long, thin routes\" — according to Boeing. The 787-900, a variant of the original model -800, is 20 feet longer. San Jose's nonstop service to Tokyo on ANA currently uses the 787-800 model. Hainan Airlines' nonstop San Jose-Beijing service is also flown on a 787. \"London is the No. 1 requested international destination from Mineta San José International Airport, and we're so pleased to share the news today that we have delivered this service to Silicon Valley businesses and residents,\" Kim Becker , the city's aviation director, said in the BA release. Matthew Mahood , San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce president and CEO, immediately hailed the flight as a \"great opportunity for both business and personal travelers. \"I am proud to have worked alongside the airport staff during this process to help reassure the airline that they will have support of the chamber and the business community to make their investment in us a success,” Mahood said. This story will continue to be updated as more information becomes available. \nGet Silicon Valley  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:30:11.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
