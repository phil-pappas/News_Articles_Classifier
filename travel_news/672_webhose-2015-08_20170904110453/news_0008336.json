It weakened to an intraday low of R12.9715.\nAgainst the euro the rand was at R14.2977 from a previous close of R14.2870. Against the pound‚ the rand was at R20.3225 from R20.1054.\nThe euro was at $1.1032 from $1.1076.\nInvestec economist Annabel Bishop said markets were very volatile. The rand continued its weakening streak against the dollar in its \"run toward the key resistance level of R13/$\".\n\"It might just prove to be the best thing for a 25-basis-point interest rate hike to occur in the US in September.\"\nThat would \"take the heat out of\" the market generated by the uncertainty as to when the \"lift-off\" of US interest rates would occur, Ms Bishop said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:49:04.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
