Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band ,” the 1967 album by The Beatles famed for its experimentation.\nRichards told Esquire magazine that the Fab Four “sounded great” when they stayed true to their original sound but “got carried away.”\n“Why not? If you’re The Beatles in the ’60s, you just get carried away — you forget what it is you wanted to do,” he said.\nHe said of “Sgt. Pepper”: “Some people think it’s a genius album, but I think it’s a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like ‘Satanic Majesties.'”\nHe was referring to “Their Satanic Majesties Request,” the Stones’ psychedelic album that came out in 1967 shortly after “Sgt. Pepper” and which Richards has previously described as the Stones’ work of which he is least proud.\nThe Beatles recorded “Sgt. Pepper” after retiring from touring and the album has often been seen as a historic moment in turning pop albums into broader artistic concepts.\nMoving away from The Beatles’ pop roots, “Sgt. Pepper” takes influences from a range of genres including Indian classical music after guitarist George Harrison traveled to India and became enthralled by Hindu philosophy.\nRichards next month is releasing “ Crosseyed Heart ,” his first solo album in 23 years.\nThe Beatles and The Rolling Stones were global superstars in the 1960s, inevitably leading to talk of a rivalry between the well-mannered Fab Four and the grittier Stones.\nSome music historians, however, believe that the supposed rift was more the result of marketing and press scrutiny rather than any deep-seated animosity between the artists.\nWatch The Beatles describe their work in this “Making of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” video:", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1439159696", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZdTtOLoPsQ?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLAwDi6KYdZqREMhQkVgVYdp8FXCNzfCHr", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band", "http://www.rollingstones.com/2015/07/17/keith-to-release-crosseyed-heart-new-solo-album/", "http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/interviews/a36899/keith-richards-interview-0915/"], "published": "2015-08-06T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:06:51.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
