Daniel Finlay captured this image of one of the two Gnat planes as it prepared for take-off \nEyewitnesses described horrified spectators screaming as the plane nosedived suddenly. \nWitness Steve Gluning, who works with aircraft, said: \"It's an airshow and it's dangerous. You know these things can happen but when they happen in front of you it's shocking. \n\"We were at the CarFest, my partner and I. Two Gnats came in. Five or six minutes doing individual and pair displays. They did a crossover. One went north and the other, I saw it jink. It went past the trees. Two or three seconds later there was a fireball. \n\"Instantly, you know that could be fatal.\" \nTessa Angel was watching the display with her husband. \n\"We saw two planes flying, weaving side by side. One was at a strange angle. My husband said: 'That's low. I hope he comes back up.' Then it went down,\" she said. \n\"People were staring, asking what happened. I didn't see any parachute. There were sirens within seconds, then a helicopter hovering.\" \nAviation expert Julian Bray said the type of Gnat plane involved in the crash had been around since 1955. \nPeter Collins, a test pilot and former RAF pilot based in Cheshire, is familiar with the aircraft. \nHe told the BBC: \"I flew it during training. I rate it as one of the best aeroplanes I've ever flown. \n\"It was designed as a fighter that was later turned into a trainer.\" Footage request \nCarFest's organisers said in a statement: \"Our thoughts are with the family of the pilot and all those affected at this time. \n\"We have helpfully received images and footage captured by those close to the site, which will aid with the police investigation. \n\"Should anyone else have similar photo or video footage, they are asked to keep hold of it in case the authorities request further information.\" Eyewitnesses described seeing a plane nosedive suddenly \nAn Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) spokesman said: \"AAIB will be investigating and is sending a team to the site.\" \nMr Evans, a car enthusiast who has just become the new presenter of BBC Top Gear, created the motoring and music festival, which raises money for BBC Children in Need. \nOther celebrities attending CarFest included TV chefs James Martin, Tom Kerridge and Paul Hollywood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T00:21:00.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
