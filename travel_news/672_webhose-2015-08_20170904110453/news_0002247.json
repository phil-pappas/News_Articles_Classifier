The hunter in question, recreational big game hunter and dentist Walter Palmer , allegedly lured Cecil out of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe in July by tying a dead animal to his vehicle. After Cecil was led out of the camp, Palmer allegedly wounded him with a crossbow, trailed him for 40 hours, and shot and killed him with a shotgun. Palmer was accompanied by two local hunting guides, which is typical for a safari hunting trip, said David Marek , CEO of Houston-area safari operator Ker & Downey. \"(Typically in a hunting safari), a client books a professional hunter who then arranges the hunt with the landowner,\" Marek said. Marek’s Katy-based safari operating business, Ker & Downey, only offers photo safaris, not hunting trips. Whether Palmer’s actions were legal or not has been hotly debated. Marek said that Palmer’s actions were illegal because Cecil was a collared animal. Palmer reportedly tried to destroy the lion’s GPS tracking collar after beheading and skinning him. Most of the legal biteback could fall on the local hunting guides, since they knew where the hunting boundaries line were. It's still unclear whether Palmer knew he was engaging in an illegal hunt. “If (the local hunting guides) lured it out of the park by trailing a bait, then I believe that was unlawful as well,” Marek said. “I doubt the client would know where the boundary line is.” After the outcry, Palmer released a statement , saying he had no idea the slain lion was a \"known, local favorite, was collared and part of a study until the end of the hunt.\" \"I relied on the expertise of my local professional guides to ensure a legal hunt,\" Palmer's statement read. As far as Cecil’s death impacting safari business, Marek said that the killing could certainly have an impact on hunting safari agencies, but should hopefully create a positive fiscal impact toward the lions' conservation. “This incident has shown the plight of lions in Africa,” Marek said. “Getting more (tourists) to come to Africa to see the lions would create an important positive economic input toward their protection.” USA Today reports that Cecil's death has indeed caused a significant drop in Zimbabwe's tourism industry. Country officials said that Zimbabwe is now seen as a county that \"does not promote and protect animal rights,\" according to USA Today. In July, Marek talked with the HBJ about his safari operation growth and how tourism has changed in the thirty years he's been in business.
