The incident comes less than a week after Snoop Dogg was briefly stopped in Sweden on suspicion of drug use after a concert near Stockholm.\nFinancial police confirmed a report by the Italian news agency ANSA that half of the cash was impounded under Italian anti-money laundering codes. In such cases, the balance is returned minus any fine set by magistrates.\nTravelers within the European Union are required to declare 10,000 euros ($11,000) or more in cash.\nSnoop Dogg played in Calabria Friday night, and is scheduled to perform Sunday at the Kendal Calling Festival in England.\nLast weekend in Sweden, the rapper was questioned and tested for suspected drug use north of the capital. Authorities said test results would not be available for some time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T16:35:29.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
