The judges then mentor rehearsal sessions, before live finale performance where guests can choose the winner. \nBranding it “The Voice of the Ocean”, the onboard contest on Princess will include karaoke try out sessions at the beginning of each cruise for vocalists who are 16 years or older. \nThere will also be two opportunities to audition during open karaoke in one of the ships lounges or showrooms. Fellow guests and cruise staff will decide who moves on to compete. \nSelected singers will then be assigned a mentor who will meet with them during the cruise to rehearse with the Princess Band and back-up singers, so contestants are able to prepare for their best possible performance. The mentors will be a Princess musical entertainer or vocalist. \nThe Voice of the Ocean Live Show will be hosted by the cruise director on the last night of the cruise, and will feature up to nine contestants performing to an audience in the Princess Theatre. \nThe audience will include three high-profile team coaches that may feature one of Princess’ guest entertainers, the hotel general manager or even the captain, and as on the TV show, the trio of coaches will listen but not see the performer as they decide to turn their “I Want You” chair to choose the singer to be on their team. \nOnce teams are chosen, each coach will then pick one finalist, before the audience then votes for the winner who will be awarded a trophy and title The Voice of the Ocean. \n“Guests will feel like they are part of the globally popular TV show performing on a high tech set almost identical to the hit show, including rotating red chairs and a live Princess band with back-up singers,” said Adrian Fischer, vice president, entertainment for Princess Cruises. \nThe competition will debut aboard Regal Princess in October, followed by Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess in November. \nEight additional ships will offer The Voice of the Ocean rolling out between January and May of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T11:26:15.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
