(Photo by Mary.… more This year, the National Football League Draft moved out of New York City for the first time in decades and was staged in Chicago at the Auditorium Theatre. Now, Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the league’s commissioner, Roger Goodell , have announced in a joint press conference the event will return to Chicago in 2016, with Goodell congratulating Emanuel by saying, \"Mission accomplished.\" NFL owners and staff are in Chicago for the league meetings, so it made sense to make the announcement now. From the start, reports said NFL officials were displeased with the draft’s traditional home , Radio City Music Hall, for scheduling events that pushed the league out of its preferred dates. To lock down the NFL’s commitment for the 2015 draft, Chicago offered the use of Grant Park for outdoor segments and agreed to pick up at least $4 million of the cost of the event. It's not yet clear where this year's draft will be held, though Grant Park will be used for the fan festival yet again, the NFL confirmed. Ultimately, the Chicago Business Journal’s Lewis Lazare reported that the 2015 Draft attracted an estimated 200,000 visitors . Beforehand, University of Chicago economist Allen Sanderson had insisted there was “no chance in hell” the draft would have a positive economic impact, but during the press conference, Emanuel cited an economic impact study the city conducted which the Chicago Tribune previously reported said indicated a $44 million direct economic impact . Either way, city officials appear satisfied enough to have negotiated a return, something that was hardly a sure thing. As Lazare also noted, the original deal for this year’s draft only covered one year. It's unclear if this most recent agreement will last beyond 2016. \nWant New York Sports Business news in your inbox?
