HANDOUT Golden, a senior at Morehouse , won the Season 7 title and was a fan favorite of the popular BET Network show, which is hosted by Franklin and often features top-selling gospel music artists.\nIt’s the first album project for the Ohio native, who said he used to pretend to direct gospel choirs.\n“I know God told me that there was a thing that he would do in my life and he was going to use me..some of those things that He’s placed in me would go out into the world,” Golden said in a previous interview with The Christian Post . “Now I’m really walking in the promise of the thing that He said He would do. So moving from promise to performance is what I think it (means) to me more than anything.”\nHis 11-track album, on which Franklin served as executive producer, will be released on the Fo Yo Soul Recordings /RCA Inspiration label and features the single, “All of My Help.”\nThe free event is open to the public.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/27/0e/19/Geoffrey-Golden_Kingdom-LIVE_Cover_FINAL.jpg", "http://www.morehouse.edu/", "http://www.bet.com/video/sundaybest/season-7/exclusives/meet-geoffrey-golden.htm", "http://www.christianpost.com/news/geoffrey-golden-exclusive-bet-sunday-best-season-7-winner-talks-feeling-inadequate-god-upholding-promise-to-singer-125654/"], "published": "2015-08-27T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:44:35.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
