Ad Feedback \nIt's strange to think we're treading in the footsteps of Matthew Ridge and Lana Coc-Kroft, although not many since; when they visited it was entirely undeveloped. \nThere's now eight traditional Tongan beachfront fales (woven from coconut fronds) on the island, leased these past nine years by American sailor and entrepreneur Mark Belvedere and his Mexican wife Veronica. \nThere is hot running water, although you're counselled to use it sparingly, and power between 12 and 4pm to charge your iPhone (cell reception, remarkably and almost disappointingly, is near-perfect) but that's it. \nMark Belvedere, owner of Eueiki Treasure Island Eco Resort, Tonga. \nHowever, they have an icebox with cold Popao , the local brew, the sea is swimmable and by my rough measure, is just 8 metres from our bed. \nJust a few metres off the coast the seafloor drops away sharply to depths of up to 200 metres and the reef begins. Close to the main fale, there's not much to see – Mark blames locals' over-fishing – but swim a couple hundred metres to the left and there's great snorkelling to be had among parrotfish, moorish idols and snapper. \nInland, Mark, an autodidact raconteur, leads us on a tour of the island, a mixture of botany, maritime history, topography and ornithology, showing us ancient tombs and where square slabs are missing from the rock beds, taken for tombstones. \nWhen it comes to whale-watching day, Mark loads us up on his self-made motorised outrigger, Tofua'a Moana, and heads into the lagoon, with two of his local guides at the prow, surveying the scene for whales. \nHe cautions that we're a couple of weeks early for the \"swimmable\", curious calf whales, but we see several mature males breaching and blowing and finally get close enough to one to plunge overboard in our masks and see them underwater. \nI get within about 10 metres of one, seeing it clearly before it powers away. It's magical. \nThe colours here are remarkable: the sand pure coral-white, the sea aquamarine, the islands pure green, and we don't see anyone else, even when we stop off at the teeming Rock Garden for a snorkel on the way home. \nBelvedere has been here nine years, one of the longest stops in a peripatetic life on the waves. \"I loved what I saw when I first got here,\" he says, waxing about the Tongan lifestyle and the unspoilt nature of these islands. \nHe's kept his operation small and basic on Eueiki, which will delight some and not be to the taste of others. \"I like to have it where I get know people, I don't want it to get like a real job, because I love what I do,\" he says. \nOn arrival in Tonga, we had stayed overnight at the Scenic Hotel, next to the airport, the refurbished, tidy Tongan outpost of the New Zealand-owned chain, although the restaurant is shut and there's no hot water. \nFrom there, it's a five-minute trip to the domestic airport next morning – to get to Vava'u, unless you're a yachtie, you do need to survive the capricious local airline, Real Tonga, whose reputation for unreliability precedes it. \nWe turn up with tickets to be told we're not on the passenger list and can't get on a flight for two days. It's not clear who else will be going either: Real Tonga weigh all their passengers and the pilot and ground crew pull out calculators and spend half an hour doing their sums before our flight departs without us; it takes the intervention of the excellent Tonga Tourism to ensure we're on the 11am 20-seater jump to Vava'u. \nMark's pitch to his punters is that it's a challenge to get to Vava'u but it's worth the effort. He's right. \nOn our last morning at Eueiki, Mark putters the outrigger back to the main island to drop us off, and pick up supplies and staff, and we head through the main town, Neiafu, which is bustling thanks to a visiting container ship (the only day sleepy Neiafu comes to life, we're told) and out to the island's south-eastern tip where, at the Ene'io Botanic Gardens, former civil servants Haniteli Fa'anunuand his wife Lucy have built a remarkable personal paradise. \nThe gardens, says Haniteli, are the story of his life. Every Tongan male is granted 8 hectares of land, and as the youngest son of the eighth son of nine, his was inevitably furthest from the village, but nearest the coast. \nHaniteli Fa'anunu at the Ene'io Botanic Gardens, Vava'u. \nAt 8 years old, as he planted his first coconut trees there, he'd never left Vava'u but he loved the story of the Garden of Eden; as he won scholarships to study in Fiji and Hawaii and became Tonga's first agriculture graduate and later its chief agronomist, he began planting. \nHe now has more than 40,000 plants and 585 species in his gardens, loosely modelled on Eden Garden at the foot of Mt Eden in Auckland, where he's an occasional visitor. \nBack then to the relative bustle of the main island, Tongatapu, and the capital, Nuku'alofa. We stay at Seaview Lodge, a Swiss-Tongan-owned boutique hotel on the quiet, scenic waterfront, where an almost-done refurbishment will bring it to an impressive European resort standard and the German-trained chef, Soane, is a draw – his grilled octopus with bruschetta and papaya is a winner. \nIt's near town, although Nuku'alofa is a fairly sleepy capital with not much going on. Especially on Sunday, the day of rest. \nHaving witnessed island church services before (if you haven't, you really should) we opt for a 20-minute boat ride out to the inner-harbour island of Pangaimotu, one of three offering day escapes, where the rambunctious Big Mama has presided for 23 years (her husband, in the kitchen, has been here 43 years) over what appears to be an expat's escape: stacks of Antipodeans chewing on bottles of Papao, eating fish burgers and leaping off the 1982 wreck of a container ship which sits just offshore and is thronged with fish. \nBig Mama, owner of Pangaimotu Island resort, Tongatapu, Tonga. \nThat evening we take a cab to the local-run Liku'alofa Resort, on Tongatapu's southern tip, where we sip yet more Popao and eat whole snapper cooked in a banana leaf as the sun sets red and slow on the horizon. It's the perfect final night of a dream trip. \nThe next morning, we just have time to divert our cab via the raging Houma Blowholes on the south coast, a 5-kilometre stretch of booming surf, before we head back to the airport for the flight home. \nIt might be a bit patronising to compare Tonga to other Pacific Island escapes, but it's very hard to see why it doesn't get the traffic enjoyed by Samoa, Fiji and Rarotonga. \nIt's less than three hours from Auckland, the people are remarkably friendly and don't seem fatigued by tourists, it's clean, beautiful, the food is good, the beaches pristine and the weather reliable. The Friendly Islands live up to their billing. \nThe writer travelled courtesy of Tourism Tonga and accommodation providers.
