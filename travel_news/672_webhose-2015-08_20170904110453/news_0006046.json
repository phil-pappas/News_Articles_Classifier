Hot-air balloons Color the Skies in a benefit for local youth...\nOK, so it’s not Albuquerque, but the almond-growing burg of Ripon, between Modesto and Manteca, has been taking advantage of Central Valley thermals to put on an impressive hot-air balloon festival for nine years. The Color the Skies Hot Air Balloon and Kite Festival creates a celestial kaleidoscope accompanied by skydivers, jets and a medical transport helicopter team. On the ground, tethered balloon rides, a pancake breakfast, train rides and lots of kids’ activities are available. A carnival and live music extend festivities into the evening.
