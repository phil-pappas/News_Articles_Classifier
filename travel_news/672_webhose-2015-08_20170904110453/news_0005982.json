Another $10 million will be spent to expand programming and educational activities. \nThe galleries have seen few changes since the museum opened in 1990, except for an exhibit on the Watergate scandal that opened in 2011. \n“It’s all panels and photos and content. It’s good stuff, but it is just not up to par with what museums are like nowadays,” said Joe Lopez, a spokesman for the Richard Nixon Foundation, a private organization that supports the library. More than half of the country’s population was born after Nixon’s presidency, he said. \nNixon was president from 1969 to 1974, when he resigned. He died in 1994. \nThe exhibits are scheduled to close on Sept. 28 and reopen in fall 2016. A spokesman for the library and museum said the design is underway and the script for the exhibits has yet to be written. \n— The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T17:35:04.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
