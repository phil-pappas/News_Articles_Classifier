Local artist Kit Wohl curated this display to allow locals, hotel guests and tourists to look into the bright future of New Orleans and reflect on how the city has thrived since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The installation is part of the hotel's continuous reinvestment in New Orleans and the revitalization of Canal Street and will be on display through October.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150821/260235\nThe installation in the previously underutilized gallery windows is a collection of mirrors from various sources with gold decals on the windowpanes to read \"Reflections of Recovery.\"\nWohl and The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans team's intention is to invite people to interact with the display and reflect on the recovery of the city while looking into what the future holds.\n\"What better than an installation of mirrors as plain and as fanciful as the city, as reflections of recovery?\" said artist Kit Wohl .\n\"The extent of which this city has thrived since the largest natural disaster in the U.S. is something to celebrate. New Orleanians and its visitors are the reason this city recovered and is now stronger than ever, which makes this display that reflects these heroes so terrific,\" said Jim Oliver , The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans General Manager.\nMuch of Wohl's inspiration for this installation was taken from bestselling author Chris Rose who recently reflected on New Orleans saying, \"We're proud of what we've got and what we've done. But we are well aware that none of this recovery could – or would – have happened without the help of hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans who volunteered to help us clean up this once-awful mess and get about the business of living again in a city that lives loud, laughing and loving long into the night.\"\nAbout The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans\nAt The Ritz-Carlton, New Orleans , located on the edge of the French Quarter, the experience of the city comes to life as soon as guests cross the threshold of the historic hotel.
