This is something that will benefit the whole of Stewart Island.\" \nThe agreement was the result of many years' discussion and was expected to be a long-term relationship, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T01:00:04.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
