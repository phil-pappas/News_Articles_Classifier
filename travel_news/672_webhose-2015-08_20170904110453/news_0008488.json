Seemingly oblivious to us that sunny midmorning, the bird sat on a limb and surveyed the waters, perhaps looking for an early lunch.\nOr maybe it was just enjoying the scenery of this 3,092-acre park that's just a few miles northeast of Rockford. Popular with canoers and small-boat sailors, the park also attracts equestrians, swimmers and mountain bikers.\nOn that humid day, we were out mostly for a relaxed amble that took us through savannas sporting huge oak trees, deep woods and wetlands — past campers, fishermen and more than a few geese. Our stroll lasted about 90 minutes, though we could have done it quicker if we hadn't stopped to watch birds, pet dogs, swat mosquitoes, look at the scores of native wildflowers and talk with other hikers and anglers about the weather and waterfowl. Truth be told, we lost the trail a couple of times, but we didn't care. (And we found it again quickly.)\nHad we wanted, we could have also hiked around 56-acre Olson Lake, which has a beach, and strolled on the park's additional 36 miles of trails. Or, if we'd had horses, ridden on 14 miles of equestrian paths.\nOnce the territory of the Sauk, Fox, Potawatami, Ottawa and Chippewa nations — and before them the Mascouten and other Miami-speaking tribes — the land was settled by farmers moving west in the mid-1800s. By 1859, the Kenosha-Rockford Railroad was running through part of the park. The railroad workers who blasted away a stony outcrop to create a rail bed are long gone (as is most of the railroad bed, which is now covered by Pierce Lake), but they left behind the park's moniker, Rock Cut.\nJeff Anderson, a Rockford native, said the park is his favorite place to go mountain biking, thanks to miles of trails with a variety of terrain that he said should please all levels of riders.\n\"I've ridden in Wisconsin, California and Wyoming, and I think Rock Cut's trails can hang with a lot of those places,\" he said. \"We even have a few steep sections, though only one short part that is very technical — and you can bypass it if you feel like it.\"\nAnderson, who has been riding in the park for about 20 years, said he typically goes out for 90-minute spins with his cycling friends and covers anywhere from 12 to 15 miles.\n\"If you wanted, with all the ins and outs, you could add several more miles to that I'm sure,\" he said. \"But an hour and a half is a good amount of time for me.\"\nOne thing the park does not offer for off-road bikers are ramps, berms, jumps or other man-made features, he said. It does, however, have some log piles that have been built up on either side of downed trees so riders can get up and over them.\nMountain bikers aren't the only ones who flock to Rock Cut. Joel Neylon, an avid birder and Rockford resident, said in a typical year, the park will be visited by more than 200 avian species that are drawn to its woodlands, lakes and wide-open meadows.\n\"We get a wide variety of birds here for sure,\" he said. \"I've seen waterfowl, warblers, various herons and birds of prey. It really depends on where you go and the season. This spring, we had an unusual visitor in the form of a red-throated loon that passed through here in April. Usually they don't come much farther south than the Hudson Bay in Canada, so it was a rule-breaker.\"\nHe said he suspected a big storm may have blown it off course and away from its normal migratory route.\n\"Waterfowl often follow the waterways,\" he said. \"So what may have happened with him was that he was in the Hudson Bay area, was blown down to the Great Lakes, continued on to Chicago and then came over here.\n\"Still, it's a little odd that he'd end up this far inland,\" he said of the bird, which was first sighted on April 1.\n\"It would have been more normal for him to have stayed near the Great Lakes, but outliers do happen and they keep us on our toes. As for this red-throated loon, I think it simply went back north to its normal stomping grounds.\"\nThough birders often enjoy quiet places, Neylon said he's a fan of Rock Cut partly because it gets lots of visitors who get a rush out of spotting different kinds of fowl.\n\"While the park gets a lot of traffic, it's big enough so that you can go out and enjoy it without getting bunched up with a lot of other people and startle the wildlife,\" he said.\n\"The nice thing about having a lot of birders out there is that if something irregular does show up like that red-throated loon, they'll report it and you can go see it. There may be other spots similar to this that have more birds, but if no one goes there, you might not hear about the cool birds visiting. Anyway, this is one of the better places for birding around here.\"\nMore information: For more information on Rock Cut State Park, see http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/RockCut.aspx or call (815) 885-3311.\nFor ideas on other things to see and do in the Rockford area, see gorockford.com .\nGetting there: Rock Cut State Park is 90 miles from Milwaukee via I-43 and I-90.
