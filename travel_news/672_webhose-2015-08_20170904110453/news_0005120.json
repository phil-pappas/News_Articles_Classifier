Add a touch of British beach-hut nostalgia and views across the Solent to Hurst Castle, however, and there is no doubt that you are on the Isle of Wight. Colwell Bay is a little-known spot on the west coast of the island, situated between the Needles and Yarmouth. At low tide the sheltered shoreline is a mass of rock pools and the sea beyond is alive with yachts, kayakers and swimmers; at sunset the bay boasts the best vantage point on the island from which to enjoy the final rays. Colwell Bay, Isle of Wight The entrepreneurs Victoria and Simon Hill bought a holiday property on the Isle of Wight in 2007, while living in Singapore, and decided to make it their permanent home in 2011. ‘After 15 years in Asia we were ready to come back to England, as our children were getting older,’ Simon explains. ‘We fell in love with Colwell Bay and used to joke that the only thing missing was great coffee.’ The Hills did not expect to be the ones buying the coffee machines, but when the opportunity to purchase the bay’s only restaurant arose a year later, they decided to dive in. After several months of refurbishment, the Hills persuaded the brothers George and Matt Adams and their brother-in-law Charlie Kearns to take the helm. The trio were working in high-profile restaurants and bars in London, but having all spent time on the Isle of Wight as children they were ready to move back and open a venue here. The Hills' have made clever use of vintage pieces to provide storage in their double-size hut. The green lockers are from Design Vintage in Brighton (photo: Emma Lewis) The Hut , as it is now known, has elevated the culinary experience on this sleepy side of the island and is attracting interest from both locals and mainlanders, who can moor offshore and be brought in by the restaurant rib if they wish.While refurbishing the restaurant, the Hills were invited to buy the adjacent row of very old beach huts. With demand for beach huts rising and their prices soaring along the British coast, the couple could have charged a premium for these, but they chose instead to ‘rent the huts for a nominal amount to locals’, Victoria says. ‘We wanted to embrace island life and recognised the importance of community within that.’ In less than 24 hours, all of the huts were spoken for. The eclectic group of occupiers includes a local B&B owner, an RNLI volunteer, an antiques dealer, a builder, an A&E consultant and a dress designer – each with their own retinue of children, grandchildren and dogs.

Behind the cheery primary-coloured doors, the occupier of each hut has the freedom to design their own interior. The results are varied, yet united by riffs on timeless British seaside style – striped deckchairs, bunting and camping stoves – that hark back to a simpler time. ‘Having grown up visiting my older sister here, I wanted our children to experience the same quintessentially British beach idyll that I had so enjoyed,’ Victoria says. She must feel the satisfaction of a job well done.

It is a peaceful place with a great community. The sunsets and restaurant make it – we can chat to friends and watch the boys enjoy their childhood.’ Shenna Merryweather in her feminine hut Sheena Merryweather, above right, has a hut with her husband, Gary. ‘Our little community has become really treasured – all very different but united by a love of this special place,’ she says. ‘Everyone shares and supports – I bake for our B&B, Rockstone Cottage , and always make extra for the children at the huts. This is our sanctuary, regardless of season.’ Fiona Lawrenson, (standing) pictured with Jane Geoghegan, right, her business partner in the Three Gates Gallery in Haslemere, and Victoria Hill (photo: Emma Lewis) Fiona Lawrenson (standing, above) says: We have a family home on the island but are the only [hut occupiers] who don’t live here all year. The sociability of our hut life is wonderful, but I have to admit that the moments of quiet escapism that come with being at the end of the row are also fabulous!’ Marianne Cheung (photo: Emma Lewis) Marianne Cheung (pictured above) says: ‘Both my boys learnt to walk on the beach, and I used to bathe them in a washing-up bowl, happy with exhaustion after a full day playing in the sand. I am passionate about vintage clothes and sailing – here we get to indulge in both, surrounded by people who care.’ Mike and Rozanna Hammond (photo: Emma Lewis) ‘Rozanna’s childhood holidays were spent on the island, and since 1976 we have repeated the tradition with our family; now we live here permanently,’ Mike Hammond says. ‘The hut, decking and ambience of great neighbours provide a lovely space for entertaining family, grandchildren and friends.’ telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:17:05.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
