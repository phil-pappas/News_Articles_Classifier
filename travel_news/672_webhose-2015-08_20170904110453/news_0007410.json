This was a trendsetter in the field of grid-connected solar PV in Kerala. \nThe plant was installed by the Kolkata-based Vikram Solar Pvt. Ltd. \nA total of 400 polycrystalline modules of 250Wp with five numbers of 20kW capacity ‘Refu-sol make string inverters’ were used in this plant. It is a grid connected system without any battery storage. \nAfter the successful commissioning of this plant, CIAL installed a 1 MWp solar PV power plant partly on the roof top and partly on the ground in the Aircraft Maintenance Hangar facility within the airport premises. \nThis plant was installed by Emvee Photovoltaic Power Pvt. Ltd. 4000 monocrystalline modules of 250Wp with 33 numbers of 30kW capacity Delta make string inverters were used in this plant, which is the first Megawatt scale installation of solar PV system in Kerala, the release said. \nBoth these plants are equipped with a SCADA system, through which remote monitoring is carried out. \nAfter commissioning, these plants have so far saved more than 550MT of CO2 emission contributing to the efforts of CIAL towards minimizing environmental degradation, CIAL said. \nThe Indian government has already directed other airports around the country to start incorporating solar energy into their daily operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:57:57.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
