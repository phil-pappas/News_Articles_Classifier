With those “tools for smart thinking” – 100 ideas drawn from a range of academic disciplines, from economics to philosophy and everything in between, to assist us in more rational (and, by implication, better) professional, personal and ethical decisions. Because, on occasion, plain, unadorned common sense can get it wrong. “Most of us do not cast a wide enough net in decision-making,’’ says Prof Nisbett, 74 - a man whom Malcolm Gladwell , the global bestselling author of The Tipping Point , Blink and Outliers describes as “the most influential thinker in my life”. ''We don’t know how to try different ways of framing the questions we have to confront in life. My toolkit shows that there are more ways to think about an issue that we have imagined, and all of them based on evidence. I’ve spent my life trying to work out how people reason. I want to teach people to be smarter and change their lives in the process.” To illustrate his claims, Prof Nisbett, who is co-director of the Culture and Cognition program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, agreed to use his ''tools’’ to tackle some dilemmas suggested by the Telegraph team. Read on for enlightenment. Q: Does it make sense to have a cleaner even if I struggle to afford it? Prof Nisbett's answer: I had a cleaner when I was a student, even though it meant eating peanut butter sandwiches for dinner. I can’t stand dirt and mess but I don’t enjoy cleaning. I calculated that my time was more valuable to me than the quality of my food. Economists would say I was being conscious of the “opportunity costs” of cleaning, so it was rational for me to hire someone. Q: How much alcohol should I drink? Prof Nisbett's answer: Research shows that a daily glass or two of wine is associated with greater longevity than drinking either more or less alcohol. So it’s irresistible to infer that modest amounts of alcohol cause a person to live longer. But just showing that one thing is related to another doesn’t prove there’s a causal link (see 'It’s Obvious, isn’t it ...?' below). We know that people who exercise regularly, who take multivitamins daily, or who keep their cholesterol under control, also tend to live longer. However, the people who do all these healthy things tend to be different from those who don’t in lots of other ways: they’re better off financially, they’re more educated, and they care more about their health. Anything that this group do is going to be associated with better health, but again such correlations don’t prove that any given practice is good for your health. To return to booze and the evidence: some alcohol is better than none because, among other things, alcohol improves insulin sensitivity [which controls the uptake of sugar from our blood] and boost levels of “good” cholesterol. So, yes, it is OK to imbibe a bit. Q: Is gambling always a fool’s game? Prof Nisbett's answer: Many people believe they have a system that makes winning likely. With the exception of “Oscar’s System” and other systems for winning at blackjack (which casinos now block), I believe there is virtually no way to win against the house. So yes, I think gambling in casinos is a fool’s game for those who do it because they think they’re going to come out ahead over the long haul. If you can find friends to play poker with who are willing to go on hanging out with you if you’re better than they are, or who you’re willing to go on hanging out with if they’re better than you are, then it’s rational to gamble. Q. Should I give beggars money, or is it better to direct the cash to a well-respected charity? Prof Nisbett's answer: This really isn’t the sort of question that speaks to the expertise in my book. The only thing I can say is that if you don’t have a policy on this issue, and have to decide for each beggar or homeless person you see whether you’re going to give money, that’s an “opportunity cost”. With the time you spend agonising over each decision, you could be enjoying the view or thinking about dinner. It’s obvious …. or is it? “If I tell you that people who eat more chocolate have more acne, its hard to resist the assumption that chocolate causes acne,” says Prof Nisbett. “But it doesn’t, as far as I know. To pull out one fact and start to speculate on its causal role makes little sense. But we do it all the time.” Consider the following apparently obvious causal relationships. Countries with higher average IQs have higher average wealth measured as GDP per capita. So being smarter makes a country richer. People who attend church have lower mortality rates than those who don’t. So believing in God makes you live longer. People who smoke marijuana are subsequently more likely to use cocaine than people who don’t smoke marijuana. So marijuana use causes cocaine use. Now think smarter… It could be that richer countries have better education systems and hence produce people who get higher IQ scores. Wealth may cause intelligence rather than the other way around. It could be that healthier people engage in more social activities of all kinds, including going to church. One reason people go to church is that they are fit enough to do so, but going there doesn’t make them healthier. It could be that people who take any kind of drug are more sensation- seeking than others and therefore engage in many kinds of stimulating behaviour that are against the law.
