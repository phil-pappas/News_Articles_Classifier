In a press release , the Central Asian airline says that under International Air Transport Association regulations, \"airlines are obliged to carry out the regular procedures of pre-flight control passengers weighing with hand baggage,\" though an IATA spokesman tells CNN the organization has never heard of that regulation before. The airline says \"full confidentiality of results is guaranteed.\" Nearly half of Uzbek adults are overweight and it's not clear whether the airline plans to start charging them extra, the Telegraph reports. (In 2013, Samoa Air started charging passengers by their weight .) The airline's motto is \"safety, stability, comfort.\" ( Wikipedia/Gennady Misko ) ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:25:24.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
