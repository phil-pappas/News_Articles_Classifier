Ravenna History \nFrom the fifth to the eighth centuries, Ravenna was the western capital of the Roman Empire and of the Byzantine Empire in Europe. Once a lagoon city, the canals were covered over in the fifteenth century during its rule by Venice and its elegant central square, Piazza del Popolo , was created. In the 1700s a new canal was built reconnecting Ravenna to the sea. Ravenna's UNESCO World Heritage Sites \nEight of Ravenna's monuments and churches from the 5th-6th centuries are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, most because of their spectacular early Christian mosaics. Mausoleo di Galla Placidia : Galla Placidia was the daughter, sister, wife, and mother of Roman emperors. She had this mausoleum built in the mid-fifth century. The interior is breath-taking. The mosaics are some of the oldest in the city. Battistero degli Ortodossi: This baptistery was built in the late fourth to early fifth centuries and is the oldest of Ravenna's monuments. Spectacular mosaics decorate the dome. Battistero degli Ariani : This baptistery is one of the few remaining monuments of the Arian cult, the official religion of the court of Theodora. The dome is again decorated with beautiful mosaics. Basilica di Sant'Apollinare Nuovo : The basilica was originally a Palatine church.
