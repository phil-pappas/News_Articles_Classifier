This indicated that the widely projected temporary downturn in arrivals following the 17 August attack in Bangkok had failed to materialize. \nThe 20 millionth visitor, Mr. Shoji Omori, from Japan, was given the traditional surprise welcome at Suvarnabhumi Airport today by the executives and representatives of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), Thai Airways International Public Co., Ltd., the Immigration Bureau, the Airports of Thailand Public Co., Ltd., and True Corporation Public Co., Ltd. \nThe 19 millionth visitor was welcomed at Phuket International Airport on 16 August, 2015. \nAs part of a “Green Season” marketing strategy that began 30 June, every millionth visitor to the country is being welcomed at Thailand’s international aviation gateways, until 30 September, 2015. \nThe lucky visitors are being pleasantly surprised to receive two economy-class return air tickets from their international port of origin to Thailand along with a five-night accommodation voucher, a “Thailand’s Luckiest Visitor” certificate as well as other prizes from TAT’s project partners. The trips have a validity period of one year. \nThe activity is designed to support the “2015 Discover Thainess” umbrella campaign, which aims to highlight the endless charm of Thailand, the diversity of destinations, the flavors of Thai cuisine, fascinating uniqueness of the traditions and culture, as well as the friendliness of its people. \nThailand’s Luckiest Visitor Date of arrival Number of days between every millionth visitor \n13th million visitor 13 June 2015 – 14th million visitor 21 June 2015 8 15th million visitor 5 July 2015 14 16th million visitor 15 July 2015 10 17th million visitor 28 July 2015 13 18th million visitor 7 August 2015 10 19th million visitor 16 August 2015 9 20th million visitor 26 August 2015 10 \nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, TAT Acting Governor and Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “Hitting the 20th million visitor mark is particularly important because it clearly indicates that arrivals have been virtually unaffected by the 17 August attack. This is a very good sign indeed. \n“If this pace continues, we are likely to exceed our projection of 28.8 million visitors in 2015. As always, we extend our warm thanks to all visitors for their continued confidence in our country and our people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T20:15:44.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
