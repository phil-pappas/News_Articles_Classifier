But not for Andy Murch, having traveled through more than 70 countries collecting experiences and images and working towards the conservation of dramatically depleting shark numbers, Andy now spends his days battling myths about sharks and educating the world on why we need to work harder to save them.\nPlaying host to one of the largest open air Aquariums in the world, Atlantis The Palm regularly joins forces with conservationists from across the globe to utilize this magnificent viewpoint into an oceanic ecosystem to highlight the many ways in which sea creatures contribute to society and to battle the myths and misconceptions attached to some of the most valuable creatures on the planet.\nWhilst there are almost certainly no great white sharks cruising in the Arabian Gulf waters off the UAE, around 29 species of sharks can still be found swimming in Dubai waters including Hammerheads, White Cheek, Tiger, Grey Reef and huge members of the ray family, the Carpenter Shark, a creature critically endangered but still populating the waters of the Gulf.\nSo if you think you know sharks, think again and read below to be flabbergasted and flummoxed by everything you DIDN’T know about the sharks swimming in Dubai’s waters:\nAre sharks really dangerous?\n• There are over 500 species of sharks and at a very minimal, 10 of those species are considered dangerous. Even then, most of the time they would rather swim away than be confronted by an unfamiliar object swimming amongst them\n• In fact, shark attacks on humans are extremely rare. Most of the time when sharks feed in the surf they simply get confused with the limited visibility. A person in the way of the shark’s test bite, is usually a case of mistaken identity\n• They also have a preference of a fish diet rather than human flesh so it is very likely that you taste as delicious to them as sea water tastes as delicious to you!\n• So what to do if you come a little too close for comfort? Despite your natural reaction to splash and thrash like a tasty looking school of fish, the smartest move is to simply swim calmly away.\nThe reasons we need to protect them:\n• There is no point to the overfishing of sharks. Not only should sharks not be eaten due to their depleting numbers but also because shark meat is poisonous and contains lethal doses of mercury, one of the biologically most active and dangerous poisons for humans!\n• Sharks are the antibodies of the sea. Whilst most think they simply swim the seas hunting prey unaware, sharks are vital in the balance of the world oceans’ ecosystem targeting diseased fish and limiting the spread of infection.\nFive things you didn’t know about sharks\n1. Sharks have a seventh sense\nSharks and rays share our senses – those of smell, taste, hearing, touch, and sight – but locate other fish and hunt prey more effectively. They have evolved two additional ways of perceiving their environment: they can sense electrical pulses and perceive both vibrations and pressure changes. This becomes particularly useful when locating fish sitting under sand and during migration by tracking the world’s magnetic field.\n2. They are pregnant for a LONG time\nGestation periods for sharks vary, from about five to six months to two full years in most shark species.\n3. They make the most of their teenage years\nSharks mature slowly, and reach reproductive age anywhere from 12 to 15 years. This, combined with the fact that many species only give birth to one or two pups at a time, means that sharks have great difficulty recovering after their populations have declined.\n4. Some are really REALLY old\nWhite sharks can live up to an impressive 50 years old and whale sharks for more than 70 years.\n5. They go to nursery\nOr at least juvenile lemon sharks do. They spend up to seven years growing up and learning from each other in a “nursery” in the shallow waters of a mangrove or coral reef. So Finding Nemo wasn’t that far from the truth after all!\n“It’s very important we try to focus on preserving the local marine species of the UAE, in particular sharks” says Natasha Christie, Director of The Lost Chambers Aquarium, who has been working this year to raise awareness of the plight of many local species. “We need to celebrate the native species of the UAE and we are proud of the work we do here at Atlantis, The Palm in ensuring the general public learn to not to fear sharks but to celebrate their existence. Ignorance spreads fear and fear breeds hate which ultimately results in the unnecessary death of these beautiful creatures, we therefore invite Dubai to come and find out more about sharks and even take a swim with them, we’re certain they’ll have a great surprise.”\nShark expert Andy Murch comments “Shark numbers have been reduced to a tiny fraction of what they once were and so it’s at this time right now that we must come together and save them for future generations. Aquariums such as The Lost Chambers at Atlantis, The Palm provide a well-balanced and safe environment for the species of sharks they look after and it is the perfect opportunity to become well acquainted with a shark and understand that there is nothing to fear. An ocean without sharks is something we should be much more frightened of.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:24:20.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
