The golf club hosted the same tournament in 1990 hen it was known as the New Zealand Women’s Veterans Match Play Championships, and it also hosted the New Zealand Women’s Autumn Foursomes in 2007.\nWhile it may not be of a top New Zealand Open standard, the course is tight and has fantastic views over Lake Te Anau. The strong club spirit is typical of a small country club with a big heart. Though women who regularly play in this match play event have a range of handicap levels, all enjoy the course layout, challenge and picturesque setting.\nWhile nearby Queenstown and Wanaka take most of the South’s limelight, any national or international visitor wanting to see and experience some of New Zealand’s best scenery should head to this tourist gem. The township and its golf course are on the shores of Lake Te Anau, which is the largest in the South Island and second only to Lake Taupo in New Zealand.\nPart of the Fiordland region, Te Anau borders the Fiordland National Park, and is a gateway to tramping wilderness and spectacular scenery. The endangered takah bird has found some sanctuary within this UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is New Zealand’s largest national park, covering more than 12,500km2.\nThe fiords of Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound are both within two hours’ drive of Te Anau. Trampers from around the world use Te Anau as their base to hike the Milford and Kepler tracks; the latter being a four-day loop around Te Anau. Last year, New Zealand Wilderness magazine voted Te Anau the best New Zealand location for tramping. Cyclists, kayakers, jet-boat enthusiasts, anglers, and hunters also visit this area for their respective hobbies and pursuits, along with golfers who want a quintessential Kiwi golf experience.\nAs one of several New Zealand golf tournaments managed by PaR nz Golfing Holidays, under the auspices of New Zealand Golf, the venue was chosen for both its presentation of a good-quality course as well as its unique tourist offerings. We recognise that many players entering senior events are looking to complement their competition golf with a holiday. Te Anau is expected to be a popular venue for this tournament, which regularly attracts more than 100 players from throughout New Zealand in addition to players from Australia, New Caledonia and Fiji.\nThe 2016 championship will be held on February 22-25 and will include 18 holes qualifying. Players aged 50 and over will then split into divisions of 16 for a minimum of three rounds of match play. The top qualifiers compete off-the-stick, while all other divisions compete in handicap match play.\nThe reigning champion, Jill Morgan of Waikato, was a first-time winner earlier this year when the tournament was held at the Hamilton Golf Club.\nTe Anau is on the doorstep of one of the country’s most talented senior women golfers, Robyn Boniface, who has won the NZ Golf Senior Veterans Cup three times and is expected to be one of many top players qualifying in the top division. With five divisions, players of all handicap levels are welcome. All are potentially competitive with handicap match play being very popular with this age group.tch Play Championships in 2016\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:55:59.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
