The shares have nearly doubled in price over the last five years as the company expanded, but are down almost 5% since the start of this year on sluggish consumer demand in SA.\nThe retailer said total sales rose 11.2% to R113.7bn for the year.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:18:04.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
