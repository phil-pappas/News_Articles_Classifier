The hotel is near the airport, making it the ideal first stop for visitors arriving in Tonga before they embark on one of Majestic Whale Encounter’s whale swim tours, held between July and October, 2016.\nEach year more whales frequent the warm waters of Tonga where they mate and give birth. Five tours will be available in 2016, with each offering an intimate experience as guests spend five days swimming with whales off Ha’apai, an island north of Nuku’alofa. Guests will also have the opportunity to snorkel in coral reefs, relax on white sandy beaches and get a taste of Tongan culture. Bush walking, kayaking, fishing, scuba diving and cycling are also available during leisure days.\nThe tours cost from A$4091 per person, twin-share and include seven nights’ resort accommodation, local flights, various meals, all transfers and five guided days on the water with the whales. A free night’s accommodation with breakfast at the Scenic Hotel Nuku’alofa prior to the tour will be included in all bookings made before September 30, 2015, for single travellers and couples.\nGuests are able to extend their stay further, including spending extra days swimming with whales, if organised in advance with Majestic Whale Encounters.\nFlights to Tonga from Australia (five hours direct) with Virgin Australia or from New Zealand with Air New Zealand and Virgin are extra.\nSource:-Majestic Whale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:14:29.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
