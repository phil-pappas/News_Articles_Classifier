The idea of focusing on nothing but health and fitness for 24 hours a day may seem a bit intense, but attending a holiday bootcamp is a brilliant way to kick-start a new exercise regime. Rather than embarking on months of post-work gym sessions and morning runs, and getting gradual results, you can fully devote yourself to the cause. It’s like giving your car a full service and a new engine. You can adopt new habits without distractions and by the end you’ll have dropped up to 12lb and feel rejuvenated. If that’s not convincing enough, here are five benefits of bootcamp: 1. It's easy With a bootcamp or weight-loss camp, all the willpower and worry is taken away immediately. You won’t have to decide to avoid drinking alcohol on Thursdays – or convince yourself to have quinoa for lunch even though you want pasta – because everything is provided, so you eat nutritionally-balanced meals because there’s no other choice. You avoid alcohol and caffeine because it’s not available, and get up at dawn because it’s expected. It’s like being at a very luxurious boarding school – you just do as you’re told. 2. You'll find your limits If you’re not sure what you’re capable of, bootcamp will help you discover it. Whether you find you’re a yoga convert, amaze yourself by running 5k uphill or reveal a newfound passion for cycling, at bootcamp you have the opportunity to invest in all manner of sporting activities and push yourself to the limit. 3. You'll tone up With up to seven hours of exercise a day, you’ll be fitter than ever before after a week. Not only will you drop several pounds, you’ll also tone up long-forgotten muscles and improve your stamina, physique and strength by the end of your trip. You might ache afterwards – but it’s a fantastic primer for making fitness a more regular part of your normal life. 4. You'll learn good habits When you’re busy, it’s easy to let good nutrition slide as your gym membership gathers fluff. Bootcamp will give you a kick-start, and remind you how much better you feel when you eat well and exercise regularly. It may also introduce you to new forms of exercise that you enjoy more than your usual routine, and the focus on fitness will give you a much better idea of what your body’s able to do. 5. You'll be proud of yourself At first, it may seem like hell to coax your sluggish body into action. But by the end of the week, you’ll want to stay longer. In fact, you’ll be positively evangelical. Plus, chances are, you’ll have a few new mates, too. Nothing brings people together like hard work and caffeine withdrawal.
