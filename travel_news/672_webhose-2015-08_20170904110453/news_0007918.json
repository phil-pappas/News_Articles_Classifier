The option to collect miles with Amazon is unique, one that no other frequent flyer or award programme is currently in a position to offer.\n“There has been a sharp rise in the number of ways to collect miles with topbonus – on the ground and in the air. For instance, customers who shop on Zalando, Amazon, ebay, OTTO, Conrad, Lieferando and numerous other established and popular portals via topbonus.de/shopping will automatically receive up to five award miles for each euro they spend. It is a fantastic way to collect miles for award flights and a wide variety of rewards from the online topbonus Shop,” says Anton Lill, Managing Director at topbonus.\nIn recent months, topbonus has gradually expanded the options to collect miles in everyday life and not just up in the air. Online shopping is the fifth way to accumulate miles with topbonus any day of the week. So far, topbonus members have been able to top up their miles accounts by transferring their DeutschlandCard (e.g. at EDEKA and ESSO) and SHELL Clubsmart points, also their American Express Membership Reward points, as a one-off transaction or a “standing order”. In addition, airberlin Visa card holders are awarded topbonus miles for every euro they spend using their card.\ntopbonus members can currently collect miles with airberlin, over 20 airline partners and roughly 200 other partners. “topbonus has grown into a popular programme that allows each member to collect miles every day, just by following their usual routines,” says Anton Lill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:42:14.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
