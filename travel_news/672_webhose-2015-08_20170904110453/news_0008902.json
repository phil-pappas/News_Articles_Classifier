Larsen made his get-away after gunning down Edmonton police Constable and war hero Will Nixon following a confrontation on 101 Street by buying a train ticket to Mountain Park. \nNixon joined the 19th Alberta Dragoons in August 1914 and survived Ypres, Festubert, Givenchy, Vimy, Passchendaale, Amiens and Cambrai before being gassed two days from the Armistice, only to get shot on a peaceful Edmonton street. His funeral cortege down Jasper Ave. stretched for five blocks. \nMay dodged telegraph wires landing on Edson’s main street and clipped the village pump taking off. A re-fuelling stop in Wabamun also almost ended in disaster when Wop brushed the tree tops. \nCampbell caught Larson in Cadomin but the hand-cuffed desperado escaped when he jumped from a railway speeder coming down the Grand Trunk Pacific grade from Mercoal. \nHe was re-captured two nights later when Campbell set up a sting in a deserted section shack. \nLarson entered the building armed with a survey stake and “looked into the muzzles of the guns” Campbell and an Alberta Provincial Police constable pointed at him. \n“Hunger, fear and the nature of the uninhabited wilderness” all played a part, the Bulletin writer surmised. \nChief Hill called it “the cleverest piece of detective work.” \nMy recent trip to the Coal Branch was nothing like Wop’s. \nTwo hours and change in the Jeep, a hike down an over-grown cutline, a short scramble down the steep bank and my fishing dog Penny and I were standing on the gravels of the Embarras River. \nOr what’s left of it. The never-ending drought has been hard on trout creeks all along the Eastern Slopes. \nThe Embarras’ bones were showing. \nI have come in search of Athabasca rainbows – Alberta’s unique trout which are the only native rainbow found east of the Continental Divide. \nMy first cast of the sweet little small-creek cane-rod I assembled last winter produced a take in a scour below an overhanging alder. \nThe next pass of the #14 Bunny Variant resulted in a second take and a hook-up. \nBut instead of a beautifully parr-marked and spotted Atha-bow, a pewter-sided grayling danced at the end of the line. \nArctic grayling are usually more prevalent on the lower sections of this short, sublime river while the upper part has been predominately trout territory in the past. \nExcept not this day. The next fish was a grayling. The same with the next and the next as I worked my way downstream, which was not the smartest thing to do because of the clouds of silt the dog and I were kicking up. \nBy the time the slanting sun said it was time to go I’m pretty sure I hooked and released 50 fish. \nOf which, curiously, only three were rainbows. \n\nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
