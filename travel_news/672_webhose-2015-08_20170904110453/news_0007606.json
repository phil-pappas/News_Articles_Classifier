That puts local gasoline prices and the average per gallon across Arkansas at 33-43 cents per gallon lower than the national average price per gallon as reported this week by the U. S. Energy Information Administration at $2.72 per gallon and by GasBuddy online at $2.66 per gallon. SW Arkansas Hope gasoline prices which ranged from $2.13 per gallon to $2.59 per gallon in February moderated to a low this week of $2.23 per gallon to $2.39 per gallon, based upon prices reported by GasBuddy online. Locally, those prices were reported as follows for Aug. 18 as follows: Murphy USA, $2.23 per gallon; Super 1 Food, $2.24 per gallon; North Hervey Shell, $2.25 per gallon; North Hazel Exxon, $2.26 per gallon; North Hazel Valero, $2.26 per gallon; North Hervey EZ Mart, $2.29 per gallon; Neighbors, $2.29 per gallon; Third and Walker Fina, $2.29 per gallon; Third and Fulton Shell, $2.39 per gallon; and North Hervey Exxon, $2.39 per gallon. In Prescott, prices hit the same range at Love's, $2.29 per gallon; Valero, $2.29 per gallon; and Shell, $2.39 per gallon. Prices were more mixed in Little River, Howard and Miller counties. Ashdown gasoline prices ranged from $2.31 per gallon at EZ Mart, Brookshire's, and Red River Oil to $2.39 per gallon at Exxon, based on GasBuddy online reports. In Nashville, prices were mixed including $2.39 per gallon at Murphy USA; $2.43 per gallon at Valero; $2.45 per gallon at EZ Mart; $2.49 per gallon at Quick Mart, Hendry Oil Co., Exxon, and Red E Mart; and $2.59 per gallon at Quick Draw. In Texarkana, prices ranged from a low of $2.19 per gallon to a high of $2.81 per gallon. Arkansas GasBuddy online tracked gasoline prices across the state from a low of $2.09 per gallon at Murphy USA in Jonesboro and Exxon in Newport to a midrange of $2.79 per gallon at B's Quick Stop in Mineral Springs and a high of $3.19 per gallon at the Park and Hwy. 298 Fina in Hot Springs. Page 2 of 4 - Statewide, gasoline prices have risen on average of 2.8 cents per gallon in the past week to an average Monday of $2.33 per gallon, which was 33 cents per gallon below the national average. Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy noted the difference stemmed from events in the Midwest. “ Prices have risen in Great Lakes states at paces rivaling and exceeding prior records, which I would pin on an unexpected emergency shutdown of a unit at BP's Whiting, Indiana refinery,” DeHaan said in an online report this week. “In addition, there have been other scheduled outages in the Midwest that may be leading to gasoline demand outpacing supply in the region, essentially causing panic on gasoline markets.” Nationally DeHaan's assessment was reflected in a report by the U. S. Energy Information Administration this week. “ Following the outage, the supply chain is now in the process of adjusting and the availability of replacement supply is apparent,” the report states. “The wholesale spot price for gasoline in Chicago, Illinois, which increased 60 center per gallon from the previous day to $2.47/gal. on August 11, has since fallen 23 cents/gal. on August 14, and has fallen a further 17 cents/gal. since then, to close at $2.07/gal. on Tuesday, August 18.” The EIA said it may require as much as a month for BP to make necessary repairs. “ EIA estimates the loss of gasoline production from that unit to be between 120,000 barrels per day and 140,000 barrels per day, based on May 2015 refinery yield data for the region and press reports of the refinery running at 40 percent capacity,” the report states. The highest recorded average per gallon price nationally for gasoline since 2008 was $4.10 in July, 2008, with the lowest hitting $1.59 per gallon in December the same year, GasBuddy online reported. The highest national average this year has been $2.81 per gallon in June, with the lowest at $2.02 per gallon in January. On average, the national price per gallon for gasoline has dropped 75 cents per gallon for the year as of Aug. 17, according to the EIA. Regional distinctions Page 3 of 4 - While the lost refinery capacity in the Midwest bears upon the national average per gallon for gasoline, it has not apparently stoked any change in the Gulf Coast region which includes Arkansas. While the national average price per gallon hit $2.72, the Gulf Coast average price per gallon was $2.43, or only 10 cents per gallon above the Arkansas average, according to the American Petroleum Institute. “ The average price for regular-grade gasoline for this week ranged from a low of $2.10 in Washington to a high of $3.75 in Los Angeles,” the API said in its weekly report of Aug. 12. Fiscal impact API reported Thursday that total petroleum deliveries rose by 2.2 percent in July, compared with July, 2014. The impact of that relationship on prices is yet to be determined, but U. S. crude oil production also increased by 8.8 percent over last year at the same time, the API reported, while imports were down by 5.5 percent on the year. But, where public budgets are concerned, the lower prices against higher demand has worked to save money for the City of Hope and Hempstead County. Budgeted fuel costs for the City were about $14,000 higher this year over 2014 at $334,000 compared to $320,000. “ We're, hopefully, not going to spend the entire amount we have in the budget,” City Manager Catherine Cook said. “I haven't looked at it from the last financial statement, but lower gas prices do help everybody.” Budgeted expenditures in the Hope Police Department for fuel costs are about $58,000 across all HPD divisions, which is essentially identical to 2014. Santiation department fuel budgets were increased by about $7,000 this year compared to 2014, and street department fuel costs were budgeted at about $77,000 as they were in 2014. Hempstead County fuel costs were budgeted at $517,000 this year, compared with $492,500 in 2014, but Hempstead County Judge Haskell Morse thinks the County may save some money this year. “ The lower prices are helping some,” Morse said. “We have a significant portion left and we are halfway through the year; we have about 65 percent of the budget left.” He said that, while gasoline prices are typically higher in the summer than winter, more savings might be possible. Page 4 of 4 - “ We're hoping that will help us out some more, but we haven't been told anything,” Morse said. Hope School District fuel costs were budgeted significantly higher this year at $150,000, compared with $110,000, in part because the district has been shifting from diesel to gasoline in its bus purchases. However, HPSD Assistant Superintendent/Transportation Director Steve Bradshaw was not available for comment at press time today.
