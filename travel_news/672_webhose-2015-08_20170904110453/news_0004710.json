This is according to the latest numbers from the Federal Statistical Office, based on statistics from accommodation facilities with ten or more beds as well as camping grounds. Overall, 27.1 million international overnights were registered, an increase of 4.1 percent.\nPetra Hedorfer, CEO of the German National Tourist Board (GNTB), explains these most recent numbers: „The big Western European source markets, in particular, contributed to the great result with excellent May numbers. Almost 500,000 extra overnights (nearly half the increase) were generated by our Top 3 markets, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Great Britain.”\nEurope continues to dominates the Top 10 markets\nGreat Britain remains in third place of Germany’s most important markets for incoming tourism with a plus of 6.9 percent for the months of January to May 2015, compared to the same period of the previous year. For May 2015 alone, Great Britain reached a growth of 7.7 percent, compared to 2014. Switzerland contributed above average growth in the first five months of the year. After the U.S., Germany’s most important overseas markets, taly,\nAustria, France, Denmark, Belgium and Poland round out the Top 10.\nKlaus Lohmann, director of the GNTO for UK and Ireland, added: “Germany is seen as an affordable and highly diverse destination which has something to offer all year round. This is reflected in these latest figures for overnight stays by visitors from the UK to Germany. The recent visit to Germany by HM The Queen and Prince Philip and the warm welcome they received there also raised public awareness of Germany worldwide”.\nDynamic growth in Asian markets\nThe Asia/Pacific source markets once again highlighted their great potential and contributed double-digit growth to Germany’s incoming tourism between January and May, 2015. China performed particularly well (a 19.4 percent increase), followed by the Arab Gulf States (an 11.7 percent increase) and India (a 10.3 percent increase).\nThe U.S. remains in first place of the overseas source markets with 1.8 million overnights in the first five months (a 3.7 percent increase). Overall, the GNTB expects an increase of roughly three percent for the country’s incoming tourism in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:27:24.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
