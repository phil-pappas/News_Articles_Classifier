However, only 2 percent of those make it into the top ratings after 5 years of consecutive CoE awards. \nReunion Island’s best-known, open-air market, St. Paul's, where the locals come to shop alongside tourists browsing through the stalls or enjoying some of the fresh food on offer, has this year made it into those ranks. Every Friday and Saturday, fresh tropical fruits are sold here, as are vegetables, flowers, fish, freshly-baked bread, spices, and other local delicacies often made with such ingredients as locally-grown vanilla and sugar cane. Homemade jams are among the items much sought after by tourists keen to take the flavor of the island home with them. Local art is found besides all sorts of items which make up for lasting memories when displayed like trophies after the tourists return to their own shores. \nSet right on the beaches of St. Paul, very distinct because they are made of black volcanic sand, the market has become a must-visit location for tourists coming to the island, where they can mix freely with Reunion Island’s population which flock from across the island to do their weekend shopping. \nFor more information about Destination Reunion Island, click on reunion.fr and for specific details on this market and similar attractions look up the link about the street markets of the island.
