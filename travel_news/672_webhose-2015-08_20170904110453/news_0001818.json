My wait is for that slow crawler Kirandaul Passenger ( Train no 58501). The intermediate part of a journey which would take me on to the interiors of Chattisgarh. I have the tickets for First Class upto Jagdalpur for a princely sum of around Rs.500/ per head. The train ambles in and a sort of anticlimax there, a very vanilla train being pulled by a vanilla engine and at the last end of the train lies our coach FC. I step into the coach and as if I step into a time warp. The silken threads of lost memories entwine me, is this not the compartment that I have travelled so many times with my parents? The same narrow corridor running through one side of the compartment and banks of coupes lined at another flank, some for 4 and yes a few for a couple of passengers. The muted luxary of a door which can be closed and the ability to create a temporary bubble of privacy but the curtains are missing upon the window as are the bedroll & the cleanliness and I was feeling lost there without my parents. The shoving and pushing co passengers thought that perhaps I am drunk or stoned or both and I neatly land into 2015. Yes me and my friend, we have got the coupe C which is a 2 berth one and the icing of the cake is that the window is a picture window, no grills and an unobstructed view. I remembered that I am carrying a camera and one single lens , a venerable 50 mm and I slither past my companion to the window side and root myself there for the rest of the journey. A quick breakfast if bada/idli and the train starts and we leave the uptown Vizag in a jiffy. The next 9 hours of journey will take us through some of the most beautiful vistas that I have ever seen, the plain red-soiled Andhra-Pradesh slowly transforms into spectacular Araku valley, unknown mountains and rivers fly by us, we traverse through uncountable tunnels in the hills, we leave behind the Bora caves and I long for a stop there but cant , The highest Broad-gauge station comes and goes ; a mere statistics, a signal plays foul and the train makes an unscheduled stop for half an hour till someone trudges there on foot and repairs it allowing us to have a walk around in the jungle, the blue hills of Koraput comes and goes ; so does the rain , the evening looms and suddenly I can barely see outside. My destination has come, I step out of the train and promise myself that I will never return here because one can never return to a day like today, a day like childhood. Now it's time to post a few images. These are all taken from running train through the window.
