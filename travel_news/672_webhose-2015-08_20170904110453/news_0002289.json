They came up with the idea when they were running an online video content business. The businesses for which they were creating content told them the existing video-sharing channels were not appropriate for business videos. Nideo’s aim was to create a professional environment where businesses could store their videos securely, and provide high-level analytics on viewers, as well as extensive customisability. In two years, Mr Kimani and Mr Hakesley have seen Nideo grow from its original two founders to a team of around 25, and they have moved into a larger office. If you take suggestions from too many people you end up losing what you had in the first place Even in the past year the business has adapted and evolved. “We’ve now got more than 700 businesses and individuals using it daily, including some decent big-sized companies, and we have moved into sectors and verticals we couldn’t originally have imagined,” says Mr Hakesley. “We’ve brought out new features and new products – a social media and video platform for employees, to encourage them to engage with each other, and training platforms so that companies wanting to train new people can give them videos to watch in advance. “We’ve also moved into the reseller market and white-label market, so all of our products and services we now white-label and sell into resellers and into companies that then can sell on their own-branded video platforms to their clients.” Mr Hakesley attributes his success to wise advice. “I have always had mentors. You sometimes need to sit down with someone who’s got a bit more experience who can tell you to focus on this or focus on that.” It hasn’t all been plain sailing, though. “We’ve made loads of mistakes along the way, ever since we were at university and produced hoodies to rival the university’s merchandise. They threatened to kick us out of university. You learn fundamental lessons from things like that. “We’ve had setbacks with development and production, but I’ve learned not to get involved in things that aren’t my forte. Now we have a decent team around us so I can leave those things to other people. There have been lots of highs and lows, but that’s the beauty of it.” Mr Hakesley believes in using his instincts. “Nideo goes through me 18 hours a day; I even dream about it, which is crazy. When you’re involved in something day in, day out, you’re the person who knows your product best and knows its capabilities. “People will say, ‘You can’t do this, you can’t do that’, or ‘it’s not cool enough or quirky enough’, but if you take suggestions from too many people you end up losing what you had in the first place. You need to stick to your core values.” Needless to say, as a tech business the Nideo office is packed with multiple monitors, tablets and smartphones. “Everyone’s passionate about which system they prefer – there are some true believers,” says Mr Hakesley. “I go everywhere with my tablet and smartphone; I can’t live without them. Our product is built to work on these devices, too, and I watch a lot of videos, so I have them with me all the time.” With the fast pace of technology, the business has to stay on its toes. “Technology never stops growing,” says Mr Hakesley. “Video technology changes and devices get better. Every week’s a different week.” See how technology is helping to transform other businesses at HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • What is lean start-up philosophy? • Consider it signed, sealed and sent with Sendy • Gaming and gambling: a new cocktail from Geonomics • Soundcheque's pitch perfect plan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:44:46.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
