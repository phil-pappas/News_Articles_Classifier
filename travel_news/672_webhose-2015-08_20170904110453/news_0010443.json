This was the first time the Russian Proton rocket had be used following a crash in May when it was carrying a Mexican satellite. \nThis failed launch also took place from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. \nGoing from rocket lift-off to satellite separation will require five rocket burns and take nearly 16 hours. Next year the Â£1 billion Global Xpress investment will welcome a fourth fifth-generation satellite, which is currently being built and tested by Boeing in El Segundo, California. \nBoeing has built all of Inmarsat's fifth generation satellites. \nDesigned to last for 15 years, each of the Global Xpress satellites weighs 6,100kg at launch and has a wingspan wider than a Boeing 737.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:06:55.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
