William Hill , current number one in the UK and Irish betting industry, is set to be superseded by “Betty Power”, as the £5.7bn combo of Paddy Power and Betfair has been dubbed. The share-based merger is intended to create a fast-talking, tech-savvy group that is as comfortable writing algorithms as treading the hallowed turf of Ascot and The Curragh. \nThe proposed transaction, involving the payment of a modest premium to Paddy Power shareholders via an €80m special dividend, is the culmination of a year of frenetic deal-doing by gambling groups. Ladbrokes is taking over Gala Coral, Playtech has been expanding into spread betting and Bwin.party is in talks with GVC and 888 . More Glencore / Ashley Madison / Banks supertax \nThe consolidation wave is driven by three trends. First, a shift from racing to sports betting. Second, a burgeoning taste for mobile wagering at the expense of high-street bookies. Third, growing regulation. \nBetfair, which deadbatted an opportunistic £1bn bid from CVC in 2013, has its roots in a betting exchange devised by tech whizz Andrew Black. Paddy Power’s heritage is of fidgety men studying the form in their local bookie amid crumpled betting slips. \nPaddy Power has a cheeky style exemplified by a “Making Mischief” section on its website that boasts such headlines as “Daft Punk get their lucky pants out for the Brits”. Certainly, the merger could cause considerable competitive mischief to William Hill , as indicated by a fall in its shares and leaps in those of its two rivals. An attempt by the big UK bookie to buy 888 this year was derailed by opposition from Israeli shareholders. \nThe partners have complex integrations of systems and cultures to execute. It should help that Betfair’s well-regarded chief executive Breon Corcoran will retain that role. Betfair chairman Gerald Corbett is bowing out with credit. The combination looks like a winning punt on paper. But so did a horse called Quantitative Easing that Lombard backed at Cheltenham this year. It crashed through the barriers, tumbled a photographer and made off in the direction of Cleeve Hill. Perpetual promotion \nPrivate equity firms believe in permanent marketing, just as Maoists believed in permanent revolution. Investing in companies is a prelude to selling those businesses, itself an overture to raising another fund. Many PE groups are beginning the third phase of that cycle with the pre-promotion of multibillion European funds that are expected to close next year. Advent, BC Partners and Cinven are among those tipped to assail the wallets of investors. The last bumper year was 2013, according to Prequin. \nCollapsing equity values are more propitious than you might think. Even when buying companies privately, toppy stock markets tend to raise prices. Private equity buyers have been paying about 10-11 times earnings before nasties. Levels of 7-8 times would feel a lot more comfortable. \nThere is a psychological difficulty, though. A fund manager whose quoted portfolio is tanking does not want a returns spreadsheet. He wants a paper bag to breathe in and out of. It can be easier to raise a €5.3bn European equity fund, as Permira did in June last year, when markets are stable. \nSome private equity firms were caught out by the 2008 crash, having raised capital at the top of the market. Those that are still in the game should have done better this time, selling swaths of businesses when prices were high. But private equity types should eschew buying back companies they floated not long before. Low cunning is best deployed discreetly. Floppy bird \nRovio Entertainment, producer of the mobile game Angry Birds, is cutting another 260 jobs . It is a difficult time and managers should act in accordance with the values that everyone at the Finnish group holds dear: they should erect a giant catapult atop Rovio HQ and use it to ping employees out on to the jobs market. \nIf you’re a kidult coder in a Red Bird hoody, it’s probably the way you’d choose to go. Rovio could even introduce a competitive element by releasing pigs into its car park and scaling redundancy payments to the number each ex-staffer knocks over. \nOK. It’s tough losing your job. But an employer that hit the jackpot with a single, mobile game was always a risky employer. The shark’s fin sales pattern for computer games is the stuff of textbooks. Instead of creating another shark’s fin, Rovio tried to stretch out the first one but with limited success. \nAs to catapult delayering, there is probably some pettifogging law that prevents it. Similar red tape prevented the great publicist Jim Moran from staging a novel candy promotion, prompting his remark: “It’s a sad day for capitalism when a man can’t fly a midget (sic) on a kite over Central Park”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:41:23.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
