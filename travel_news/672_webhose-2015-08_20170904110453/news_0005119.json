The suitcase travels along a network of conveyor belts with a motorway-like feel, twisting, turning and flipping through the airport’s industrial back rooms, before swiftly being lowered into a series of lifts in a slick 'James Bond film scene-like' fashion. The bag finally reaches a central storage facility where it is grabbed by a large baggage handling robot arm that automatically places it into a container to be boarded on a plane. These robotic baggage handlers have been installed at the airport since 2009, while a Mechanical Unloading Module (MUM) was launched a year earlier, allowing suitcases to be unloaded automatically from containers for the first time ever. Amsterdam Schiphol is Europe’s fifth busiest airport, having received 55 million passengers last year. Many airports of the future will be following its lead when it comes to new technology. The upcoming Norman Foster-designed Mexico City International aims to be the world’s most sustainable airport, while offering a more efficient passenger experience with shorter walking distances. The redevelopment of Singapore’s Changi Airport continues this year with the construction of a new terminal building - the Jewel Changi. The giant doughnut-shaped complex will connect the airport’s three existing terminals via glass walkways. Its centre piece, the Rain Vortex, is set to be the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. The building will also be home to one of the world's largest indoor plant collections, while the upper level will house Canopy Park, 13,000m² of gardens, walking trails, playgrounds and dining venues. It will take several years to complete. The Istanbul New Airport, which will replace the city’s current Ataturk Airport, will feature six runways and the world’s largest airport terminal under one roof, covering a floor space of around a million square metres.
