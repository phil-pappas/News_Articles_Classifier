I was told that this is to avoid the expense of having to provide a third relief pilot. Is this safe?\n— Submitted by reader Mark, Denver\nA: Controlled napping is a well known, safe and effective mitigation for fatigue. It is not solely a cost issue. Emirates, and many other airlines, have specific procedures based on fatigue studies. One pilot is permitted to nap for 40 minutes, after advising the purser and other pilot. This controlled nap results in the pilot being less fatigued for landing. The FAA has not, so far, permitted U.S. airlines to adopt this fatigue mitigation. I hope one day it will.\nControlled napping can be effectively used on flights where no third pilot is required. The goal is to have pilots best prepared for landing.\nQ: What is the current FAA regulation regarding consumption of alcohol, food and sleep requirements for flight crews on major airlines serving the U.S. markets?\n— Bob, Queensland, Australia\nA: The alcohol limitation is eight hours, but nearly all airlines are stricter than that. The food requirement is not defined and sleep requirements are not addressed. It is clearly stated that a pilot must be in good physical and physiological condition before assuming their duties.\nQ: Do you stay at hotels or use crash houses on overnights and layovers? Do airlines always supply a hotel?\n— Mark Raymond, Seattle\nA: On overnights, the airline provides hotel accommodations. If a pilot lives in a city other than where they are based (a very common situation), they are responsible for accommodation the night before the flight or after the flight arrives back to their base. In those cases the use of “crash pads” is common due to cost.\nQ: How do pilots deal with jet lag on international routes? Any advice for an occasional traveler?\n— Janeane, Boston\nA: First off, stay hydrated. If you are going eastbound, a short nap (under three hours) can help when you arrive. Also try to adjust your eating, sleeping and working schedule to local time, unless you are only going to be in the country for 48 hours or less.\nMORE: Read previous columns\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\n31 CONNECT 88 TWEET 13 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1TKY9xu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1TKY9xu", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd3feb569597b9069845cdb1eb35dcef20497a6e/c=161-0-2822-2001&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635751041303239012-ThinkstockPhotos-134089658.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635751041303239012-ThinkstockPhotos-134089658.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1TKY9xu&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20Can%20pilots%20nap%20in%20the%20cockpit%3F&via=usatoday", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1TKY9xu&mini=true"], "published": "2015-08-16T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:56:32.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
