The gunman was still at large.\n“We do not know the motive. We do not know who the suspect or the killer is,” said WDBJ general manager Jeffrey Marks as he confirmed the deaths to viewers.\nWDBJ is located in the southern Virginia city of Roanoke.\nMarks said Parker and Ward were “both in love with other members of the team” at WDBJ.\nThe woman that Parker was interviewing on a balcony at the lakeside Bridgewater Resort in the town of Moneta, near Roanoke, was reportedly wounded.\nParker was talking to the woman about tourism development for WDBJ’s early-morning newscast when the gunman seemingly closed in from behind.\nTV reporter Alison Parker, left, during an interview on tourism at a water park before she was shot and killed.\nAFP/WDBJ7-TV\nSeveral shots were heard, as well as screams, as Ward’s camera fell to the floor, capturing a fuzzy image of the gunman, dressed in dark clothing.\nThe station then cut away to a startled anchorwoman back in the studio.\nOn her Facebook page, Parker — whose birthday was just a week ago — described herself as the “mornin’ reporter” at WDBJ with an interest in ballroom dancing.\nWDBJ anchor Chris Hurst tweeted that he and Parker were “very much in love,” adding: “I am numb.”\n“She worked with Adam every day. They were a team. I am heartbroken for his fiancee,” Hurst said.\nVirginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said on Twitter that he was “heartbroken over [the] senseless murders.”\nHeartbroken over senseless murders today in Smith Mountain Lake.
