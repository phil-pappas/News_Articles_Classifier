That big, cigar-shaped thing you’ve seen floating over sports events all your life will still be there. It will also remain instantly recognizable with its blue-and-gold Goodyear logo emblazoned across the side.\nIt just won’t be, well, technically, a blimp.\nBut that’s OK, too, because from the ground it won’t look much different from Goodyear’s Spirit of America, which was deflated and disassembled earlier this month after a farewell flight across California.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time “It’s a brand new design. It is a much larger airship. It’s a semi-rigid dirigible,” Goodyear’s Priscilla Tasker said of the new fleet of non-blimps replacing the company’s three aging U.S. airships.\nIn air-speak that means the new model has a fixed structure holding its big, gassy balloon in place. That’s unlike a blimp, which goes flat when the helium is removed.\n“But the most impressive features are the glass cockpit that is all fly-by-wire, the most state-of-the-art avionics in airships today,” Tasker said.\nThe first of the new models, Ohio-based Wingfoot One, took to the sky last year, replacing the 14-year-old Spirit of Goodyear. The last of the old ones, Florida-based Spirit of Innovation, will fly to California next month to replace Spirit of America while its replacement is being built. After that, Spirit of Innovation will be retired.\nThe new ships, with three engines instead of two, will be able to hit freeway speeds of 73 mph and make less racket getting from place to place. They’ll also be more maneuverable. And they’ll still be carried aloft by helium.\nThe overhaul comes on the 90th anniversary of Goodyear’s entry into the dirigible business, but there’s more than a birthday bash involved.\nMost people who see the iconic blimp hovering overhead are at a sporting event or major entertainment show like the Academy Awards.\nBut the ship isn’t there just to show off. The people inside its gondola are filming the bird’s-eye-view scenes you see on television, and they say they’ll be able to do that better with a faster, more maneuverable craft.\nWith quieter engines you might not hear the new one coming. But it will be harder to miss once it gets there: The replacement models are 246 feet long, nearly the length of a football field and 50 feet longer than the old ones.\nJOHN ROGERS JAE C.
