The deal, which gives Avolon a total enterprise value of USD$7.6 billion, would give Bohai 100 percent ownership of the world's 11th-largest aircraft lessor.\nThe USD$32 per share offer was $1 per share higher than Bohai's earlier approach in July and represents a premium of 11.3 percent to Avolon's Friday close of USD$28.76. It is also $2 per share higher than an offer from a rival unidentified suitor.\nBohai and Avolon now have until September 7 to negotiate a deal.\nChinese lessors, mostly backed by state-owned banks, have been expanding in recent years as large carriers such as Hainan Airlines, Air China, China Eastern and China Southern launch more routes at home and overseas.\nBohai, a unit of aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group, bid for all of Avolon after learning there was another bidder, having originally offered to buy 20 percent of the company for USD$429 million at $26 per share.\nAvolon, which was founded by leasing entrepreneurs Domhnal Slattery and John Higgins in 2010, was floated last December. It owned or managed 152 aircraft at the end of June and had more than 100 more on order.\nAhead of Avolon's flotation, China Investment and AVIC had been in talks to acquire the company.\nThe offer includes a break fee of up to USD$250 million in the event that the deal does not go ahead under certain circumstances, with an initial USD$75 million deposited by Bohai as a \"good faith\" measure.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:22:26.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
