Ryley our youngest son outlasted his parents and didn't sleep on the plane. However he did go missing in the Brisbane Airport Koru lounge. We thought his selection of a bed was very novel! \nI think my photo captures my feelings of freedom and bliss at the summit of Mt Fujisan in Japan. \nSpending Christmas Day at Muyuna Lodge – 140 kilometres up the Amazon River from Iquitos, Peru – was unique enough until it was time for our afternoon activity: piranha fishing. Once the canoe nestled into position amongst the lilies, we were passed a 2-metre bamboo rod with the same length hooked nylon line and some raw meat and were all set to go. Bites were almost immediate. Raphael, our guide, had been joined by a local villager who deftly dealt to our small snapping catches, which none of us were game to do. They were later pan-fried and served to us as a treat at the end of dinner. \nEden Gribbin, Cathy Trentham, Michael Hanright pose for a photo in the warm water down stream of the Cascade Waterfalls near Port Vila, Vanuatu. Eight of us went over for a holiday and to celebrate Eden turning 30 years old. \nThis photo was taken on a river in the Bolivian Rainforest. A monkey jumped on my friend James and I was there to capture the selfie action moment. \nA visit to the wet market in Bagan, Myanmar, is an assault to the senses. The smells of stinky fish and rotten fruit accompany the sights of barefooted kids running around amongst their parents hacking meat with machetes. It is an eye-opening place and a true representation of local life in Myanmar. \nWe took a one hour open top canal cruise that was the ultimate way for us to see Amsterdam. We Cruised along the capital's principal canals and enjoyed the wonderful views of Amsterdam's most beautiful canal belt, that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. We got to see the city's gracious 17th century gabled merchant’s houses, the numerous baroque churches, and the enchanting bridges, got a view of the city from the original harbour & the Westerkerk also the Anne Frank House. Our guide was interesting; she talked about the history of the city and how it evolved over hundreds of years. We also learned about how Amsterdam was affected during WWII. \nKids playing in the magical sunset at a tour in Dubai, the night included belly dancers, Arabic food and camel rides but this I found the most serene. \nWe joined a tour group touring the Blue Mountain near Sydney. I captured Alex taking photos of the mountains \nOver 7 days we trekked 80kms around lakes, snow and mountains... not a bad effort for two fair weather weekend hikers! There was so much beauty but not without hard work and me close to tears on some (all!) of the summits. At one point I thought my hands were going to freeze off and Vicky would have to drag me up to the hut (where the three course meal awaited!). To our surprise we were the youngest on the trail, many retired couples or friends pushing on much further or higher than us. It was a truly inspirational trip. 1 of 10 « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nOur travel photo entries this week take us from the summit of Mt Fujisan in Japan to a fish market in Myanmar and feature everything from monkeys to waterfalls. \nDo you have a holiday snap that you'd like to share with the world? \nClick the big green button to send it to us and be in to win a Panasonic camera!
