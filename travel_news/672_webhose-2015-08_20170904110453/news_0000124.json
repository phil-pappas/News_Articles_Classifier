Though they are looking for a place to live in St. James, the couple currently resides in St. Clair, near Mankato, where she had been teaching at the local school district. Because she applied at St. Clair for the first-grade teaching position, and because she spent the first two years of her collegiate career at the University of Minnesota studying nursing, she “sort of fell into” the special ed teaching role. “People saw it in me before I did; they saw the drive and motivation,” she said. “I more or less lived up to their expectations, and now I love it.” Of course, she gained the necessary perspective for her job before actually doing it. For example, while she was in high school, a neighbor of hers had a special needs child, and Monson grew close, first as a babysitter, and later as a quasi-home health caregiver for a summer, she said. “I knew a little of what I was getting into after that.” One of her precepts in teaching special ed is to treat her students just like any other students, albeit also helping them with whatever their unique need or needs happen to be, she said. In fact, in St. Clair, she often received compliments to the effect of, “Betsy runs her class like a regular classroom, not like a special education classroom.” That’s not to say she isn’t attuned to their special needs, of course. She’s spending her summer reading over files of each of her students, and “getting to know each kid” will be key--”I’ll take it as it comes.” She initially had designs on nursing, because her mother was a nurse, but as she took more classes at Minnesota, she found herself gravitating toward working with children and drifting away from the science courses, she said. She also worked at a child care facility, and, eventually, she had the epiphany she wanted to teach children and transfered to Minnesota State University-Mankato for their acclaimed teaching program. Spencer Monson also didn’t take a direct route to physical education teaching, although he always enjoyed working with kids, he said. An adroit basketball player, he realized teaching physical education was for him while working a basketball camp at Riverland college. His goal is to teach lifelong fitness skills, he said. “You see so many unhealthy people every day, and you wonder, if they would’ve learned those skills earlier...I want to teach them things they can do in their house every day that’ll carry on for the rest of their lives.” Page 2 of 2 - Spencer and Betsy certainly stay active, playing basketball and volleyball and taking walks with their two dogs. The pair actually met through basketball, as they both came to shoot hoops at Tip’s Gym, a rural gym converted from a barn in Winnebago, he said. The two started dating during their second semester of college freshmen year, transferred together to MSU-Mankato, and tied the knot in 2012. She said he’ll be able to teach these young students “how to get along with somebody who disagrees with you” during physical education courses. “I’m really excited for Spencer, because he’s really excited about teaching, and I think his students will thrive--I saw it during his student teaching.” He said learning social skills, team skills, and how to work well with others will be taught in his courses. She is originally from Truman, and he hails from Frost and is a graduate of Blue Earth Area High School. When they’re not teaching or playing sports, they devote their time to traveling, taking in concerts, and spending time with their two dogs, Watson, an Irish Terrier, who will turn one in September, and Rocky, a 10-year-old Jack Russell Terrier. Traveling to see myriad musical acts is enjoyable for them both, as she adores the traveling portion, and he loves the bands, she said. Some of her favorite travel spots include Italy, London, and Colorado, and musical acts they’ve been enamored with include Paul McCartney, Rod Stewart, and Coldplay.
