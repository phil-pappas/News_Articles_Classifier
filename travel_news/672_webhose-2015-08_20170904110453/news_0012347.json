Getting to others, like Orkney and St Kilda, are real travel adventures but repay your time and effort with extraordinary rewards. Plan an itinerary around these special places to turn a visit to Scotland into a trip of a lifetime. The Forth Bridge - Scotland's newest UNESCO World Heritage Site. Neale Clark/Getty Images 1. Forth Bridge \nThe Forth Bridge is Scotland's newest World Heritage Site, achieving the distinction in July 2015, just in time for its 125th birthday. Spanning the Firth of Forth about nine miles west of Edinburgh at South Queensferry, the railway bridge was the world's first multispan cantilever bridge. At 2,529 meters (that's about 1.57 miles) is is still one of the longest bridges of its kind. \nThe bridge opened in 1890, about the time that trains were taking over the market for long distance travel. Its UNESCO listing notes: \n\"Its distinctive industrial aesthetic is the result of a forthright and unadorned display of its structural components. Innovative in style, materials and scale, the Forth Bridge is an important milestone in bridge design and construction...\" How to see the Forth Bridge On foot - Footpaths on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, around South Queensferry and the north shore at North Queensferry offer good views of the bridge, one of the iconic symbols of Scotland. If you're visiting Edinburgh, climb up to Arthur's Seat or Salisbury Crags in Holyrood Park for a long distance view. On the bridge - Plans are in the works to create two new visitor experiences on the bridge. A visitor center at North Queensferry will include an open air lift to a viewing platform at the top of the north tower. Guided walks from a center at South Queensferry will take thrill seekers on a hike to the top of the south tower. You can watch several videos and keep up with developments on The Forth Bridge Experience here. By boat - Forth Tours run regularly scheduled boat trips on the Firth that pass under the bridge from a pier in South Queensferry. They also have a coach at boat trip service that leaves from Edinburgh center. The Maid of the Forth operates a ferry service to Inchorn Island in the middle of the Firth that also offers good views of the bridge. The Forth Bridge in Story \nThe bridge is painted with bright orange anti-rust coating. It takes 10 years to paint the bridge and in the past, as soon as the painters finished at one end, they had to begin again at the other. So in British idiom, a never ending task is said to be like painting the Forth Bridge. \nThat's not true anymore though. When the painters last completed their 10-year task, in 2011, National Rail, guardians of the bridge, said new paints and painting technology meant the bridge could be free of painters' scaffolding and drop cloths for 20 years. \n2. St Kilda \nIn 1930, the entire population of St Kilda (all 36 of them) left the one inhabited island of this remote archipelago, 110 miles west of Scotland, for the mainland. That was the end of a village that had existed at least 1,000 years. Other island evidence showed people had been using the island for almost 4,000 years. \nSt Kilda is one of the rare UNESCO World Heritage sites that is inscribed on the list for both its cultural and natural value. In 1986 it became the first World Heritage Site in Scotland. In 2005 it joined an elite group of a few dozen listed for both cultural and natural importance. In 2013 it was moved up to the status of Outstanding Universal Value - reserved for what UNESCO considers the most remarkable places on earth. Why St Kilda? Culturally, World Heritage status will help to protect the evidence of at least \"two millennia of human occupation in extreme conditions.\" The islanders practiced a subsistance economy of keeping sheep, gathering bird products and tending the land. The evidence of their abandoned village, with its sheep pens and cleits (dry stone storage buildings) still stands above St Kilda's only port, on Hirta. The island group was formed by ancient volcanic action, glaciers and erosion producing outstanding scenery and dramatic sea stacks. Most of St. Kilda is nearly vertical. Wildlife and biodiversity on the islands is a good reason for visiting.More than 1 million seabirds use the islands for nesting and migratory stops, especially puffins, gannets and fulmars. The islands are also home to feral Soay sheep, an ancient breed that may have been brought there by St Kilda's first settlers, thousands of years ago. Even the underwater scenery and biodiversity is included in the World Heritage listing. Getting to St Kilda... \n...is no easy task. You can book a cruise to the island but whether you will be able to land depends on the weather and the tides - there's no guarantee. Read our report on a Voyage to St Kilda. \nFor an idea of how hard life was for the original islanders, visit Glasgow's Riverside Museum where they keep a \"Jollyboat\", one of the last rowing boats that the islanders used to ferry supplies, mail and tourists to a passing steamship.

Edinburgh Old and New Towns \nScotland's capital and the seat of its new Parliament, combines the young and modern feel of a great university city and national capital with a historic and dramatic setting. It holds the world's biggest performing arts festival , has a 1,000 year old castle and a mountain - Arthur's Seat - right in the middle of town. \nThe city, the Scottish capital since the 15th century, is divided into two distinct areas - a Georgian and neoclassical New Town with broad avenues and garden squares and the Old Town, topped by the medieval fortress known as Edinburgh Castle. \nThe UNESCO listing notes that the harmonious position of the two areas give the city its unique character and, praising Edinburgh's \"far reaching influence on urban planning\", says: \n\"The contrast between the organic medieval Old Town and the planned Georgian New Town of Edinburgh, Scotland, provides a clarity of urban structure unrivalled in Europe.\" The Princes Street Gardens \nA park, with hills, valleys and woodlands - known as the Princes Street Gardens - separates Edinburgh's Old and New Towns and provides a setting for the neoclassical Scottish National Galleries and the Royal Scottish Academy . It looks, for all the world, like a natural landscape, at one with Edinburgh's hills and its dramatic Castle Rock. \nIn fact, it is entirely man made, formed by draining Nor Loch - itself a man-made loch - that had been part of the castle defences. The gardens and the hill known as The Mound were created from more than a million cart loads of spoil excavated during the building of the New Town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T23:43:21.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
