Entitled ‘Water for our Future’, the 7th edition of the world’s largest event on water issues was heralded by participants as the most politically impactful ever. All of these participants have engaged in dialogue and debate putting water at the heart of our future. During the week, the water community and decision-makers agreed that investing in water must be a top priority for the political agenda in the next decade.\nThe 7th World Water Forum facilitated a number of political agreements which mark a step forward in international water co-operation. These agreements include the historic signing of a new agreement between the US and Mexico regarding the Colorado River Management. The Forum also saw a trilateral ministerial meeting between Japan-China-Korea where ministers pledged to strengthen the core-role of water in sustainable development and attract more financial investment in the water sectors.\nBenedito Braga, President of the World Water Council said “The 7th Forum has demonstrated that it is the place where world leaders in the water community come to mobilize political action.” “The pledges made during the 7th Forum will be carried to New York as a major contribution to the adoption of a Sustainable Development Goal on water.” “A clear commitment has emerged from this week: to carry forward an agenda for action that will send a clear signal to the world: we know what needs to be done, and we are getting on with the job.” The 7th Forum once again has proven to be the place where the water community comes together to trigger action at all levels.\nIn addition to that, the organizing committee of the 7th World Water Forum and Daegu Convention & Visitors Bureau had their best to make the 7th World Water Forum into the sustainable meeting.\nFor that reason, we had conducted ‘Be a Green Man’, the Daegu Sprouts, and Kids Carbon Detective campaign. ‘Be a Green Man’ campaign strived to encourage forum participants on how to reduce carbon from their lives during the 7th World Water Forum such as reducing printouts and paper cups, to separate garbage and to use local products. Then trees were donated to local elementary schools under the name of the participants of the campaign to promote healthy living to the local community and some of participants planted a tree themselves with elementary school students as an urban garden program, Daegu sprouts.\n‘Kids Carbon Detectives’, consisted of 20 local elementary school students who monitored emissions of carbon dioxide from the campaign promotion booth and promote how to reduce carbon emissions at home.\nThe organizing committee of the 7th World Water Forum and Daegu Convention & Visitors Bureau organized these campaigns to promote Daegu’s brand as an eco-friendly city and to elevate the 7th World Water Forum in Daegu and Gyeongbuk as an eco-friendly event which takes social responsibility seriously.\nIn addition to the most politically impactful forum, the 7th World Water Forum was known for the most socially, environmentally and local-friendly impactful forum ever.-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T05:24:51.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
