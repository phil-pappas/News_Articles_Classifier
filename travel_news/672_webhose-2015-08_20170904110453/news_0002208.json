Beaches at Lennox Head were closed on Wednesday after a helicopter patrol spotted a large shark cruising near swimming areas.\nIt came on the same day as the latest survivor of an attack six days ago spoke for the first time after being roused from an induced coma following emergency surgery.\nCraig Ison had just entered the water at Evans Head last Friday when a great white shark latched on to his left thigh, then his left arm and hand.\n“Its head was right there, just gouging out my leg,” the 51- year-old told local media from his hospital bed on Wednesday. “I saw it go past but it didn’t think anything of it because I thought it was a dolphin and there’s always dolphins out there.”\n“I had just got out. I was paddling to get a wave. It was my first wave,” he recalled. “And boom, it just quickly turned. The bugger had me on the way back into the beach.”\nIson, a former high-ranking boxer, began punching the shark, but thought he was going to die. “He (the shark) just thrust forward and locked down, straight on to my thigh,” Ison said.\n“I didn’t have any other option than watching him chew my leg off, so I hit him.”\nA fellow surfer helped him ashore where he has then rushed to hospital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:28:01.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
