There are now more than 1,000 sites to visit all over the world. Not bad, considering the original list, compiled in 1978, included only 12 entries. There are still a few months till the newest members of the prestigious list are announced in June, so here's a look back at 20 of the most beautiful -- and famous -- already on the list. Site details in the gallery above, while info on getting to each is below. The site is a 20-minute tuk-tuk ride from the city of Siem Reap. The bulk of visitors come between November and February, when the weather is dry and temperatures are coolest (25-30 C). To make the most of your visit to this incredible temple complex, a guide is essential. We recommend Tong Hann of the Anantara Angkor Resort & Spa. His knowledge and respect for the sites and their history is phenomenal; he's particularly skilled at creating an itinerary that will keep you away from crowds and allow you to check out some lesser known but beautiful ruins. It's possible to take a tour to the site, or simply wander in from Athens on foot. The route along Adrianou Street to the back entrance of the site is a gentler climb than the Dionysus Theatre entrance. Ok, so it's still on the tentative list. But we couldn't help but include this beautiful stretch of ruins on the Irawaddy River that dates to the 10th century. Located in Myanmar's central west, Bagan is serviced by flights, buses and trains from Yangon. Accommodation is centered in the surrounding villages of New Bagan and Nyaung Oo. Located nearly 1,000 kilometers from mainland Ecuador, the islands are serviced by flights from Quito and Guayaquil. Multi-day boat cruises are generally the best way to explore the islands. For a truly rewarding experience, there's the National Geographic Galapagos Expedition. Goreme National Park and the Rock Sites of Cappadocia (Turkey) Due to the remote nature of the site in central Anatolia, most visitors opt to fly in from Istanbul to visit the area on a tour. Hotels cut out of the rock provide accommodation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T17:50:43.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
