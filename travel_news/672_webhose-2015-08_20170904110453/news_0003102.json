Android Lollipop continues to grow and is now running on over eighteen percent of active Android devices. But questions remain over Google’s ability to roll out vital changes to Android.\nNormally updated monthly, the Dashboard report was skipped in July, so this report covers the recent rollouts of new Android firmware from manufacturers, as well as sales of new devices during June and July. The numbers are gathered from users visiting the Google Play Store using the Android app over a seven day period which closed on August 3rd 2015.\nThe last report at the start of June, saw Android Lollipop (versions 5.0 and 5.1) installed on 11.6% of devices over the seven-day period. Two months later, Lollipop has reached a share of 18.1%.\nAndroid Distribution Graph, August 2015 (Image: Google.com)\nKitKat’s adoption has stayed at broadly the same level (rising a tenth of a percent to 39.3%), with Lollipop’s increased share mirrored in drops for Ice Cream Sandwich, Gingerbread, and Froyo variants.\nGiven the accepted two-year product replacement cycle tied to a mobile contract, the churn of older versions of Android moving to the latest version is probably a function of users purchasing new handsets, and popping the older handsets in a drawer. The launch of the flagship handsets such as the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge with Android Lollipop available ‘out of the box’ will have helped boost that percentage.\nOnce again, it’s hard not to compare the slow adoption of Android when stacked next to the speed that Apple can roll out updates to iOS across its range of devices. Apple may have an advantage by having much closer ties between software and hardware, but that is by design, and there are far fewer obstructions to getting bug-fixes, patches, and new features out to users.\nThat might seem trivial and a ‘well, thats how Android is’ attitude might be prevalent thanks to the long process chain that involves Google, manufactures, carriers, and users, but when Google is alerted to a significant and frightening exploit like Stagefright , and almost four months later the vast majority of users are awaiting for the software fix to arrive, the lack of timely updates rolling out to users and being installed is a worry.\nDepending on the code, security updates in some circumstances can be rolled out through the updates to Google Play Store, but in other cases it requires a new version of Android to be installed. And that’s where everything breaks down. The slow update of Android Lollipop since its public availability in November 2014 shows no sign of accelerating, and there is no indication in the announcement of Android M that the next version of Android will roll out any faster than Lollipop.\nAnd that leaves me feeling uneasy about the ongoing security of the mobile operating system.\nAndroid M\nYou can find more of my work at ewanspence.co.uk .
