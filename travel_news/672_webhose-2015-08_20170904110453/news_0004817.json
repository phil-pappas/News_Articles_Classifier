It had hoped to complete the acquisition in the second half of this year, but the proposed buyout is still under review by the Justice Department.\nThe hotel trade group said Thursday that the deal would “severely reduce consumer choice.” It also noted that Expedia charges hotels, on average, 11 percent higher commissions than Orbitz.\nMost Read Stories ESPN video: Percy Harvin opens up about what went wrong in Seattle Amazon angst: from traffic to housing, we’re all worked up It’s election time.
