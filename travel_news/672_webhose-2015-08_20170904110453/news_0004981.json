San Francisco, CA, August 06, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Tripping.com, the world’s largest vacation rental search engine, is pleased to announce the winners of its spring Study Abroad Scholarship: Francine Alexandre and Mosekola Yoloye. The scholarship, open to college undergraduates and college-bound high school seniors, required applicants to write an engaging travel guide about their hometown for a chance of winning $1,000 to be put toward travel or study abroad opportunities. The two winners were selected from more than 40 applicants.Francine Alexandre is a political science major at Boston College, class of 2017. Her travel guide focused on Boston, MA, highlights –things to do, places to stay, and ‘life hacks,’ or local tips on how to explore the historic city in the most efficient way possible. Francine will be spending her spring semester studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa. While the prospect of being so far from home is daunting, she remains enthusiastic, “I am eager to learn [South African] customs, try traditional dishes, and maybe even pick up on the local dialect.”Mosekola Yoloye, class of 2017, is an engineering major at Santa Clara University. She created a colorful guide to Oakland, CA, including restaurants and must-see destinations, bringing special attention to an area often overshadowed by nearby San Francisco. She will be using the scholarship to study abroad at Queen Mary University of London, and tells Tripping.com, “What I’m probably most excited about is meeting new people and exploring the city.”This is Tripping.com’s first scholarship, and the caliber of applications was impressive.“It was a tough decision, there were so many excellent travel guides submitted,” says Tripping.com CEO and founder, Jen O’Neal. “Studying abroad was a highlight of my college years, and the experiences I had while living and learning in Italy were a big part of what inspired me to found a company dedicated to providing local, authentic travel accommodations across the world. Tripping.com is proud to play a part in supporting the travel dreams of these two young women.”Tripping.com plans on offering an additional scholarship opportunity later in 2015.
