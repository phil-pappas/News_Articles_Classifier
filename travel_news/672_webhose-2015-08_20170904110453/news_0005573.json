I check for cheap flights on Priceline.com and Travelocity.com and get price drop alerts on my favorite routes from AirfareWatchDog.com, BookingBuddy.com and Yapta.com. \nBut while I do find savings, I'm not always getting the rock bottom prices. That's according to Matt Ma, co-founder of TheFlightDeal.com, a website with the slogan, \"Just because it's a great fare doesn't mean it's a great deal.\" \nGreat deals, says Ma, are based on a simple criterion. \n\"We only publish fares that are 6 cents a mile or less,\" says Ma. \"Using that formula, a nonstop trip from New York to Barcelona, for example, should never be more than $425.\" \nThe site lists a changing mix of routes and prices, some of which — like \"mistake fares\" — come and go quickly. Last Christmas, The Flight Deal posted airfare from New York City to Abu Dhabi for $187. \n\"Sometimes there's a systems glitch. If you can grab it before the airline fixes the price, you've got an amazing deal,\" says Ma. \nTaking advantage of savings like these though, takes flexibility. Rather than deciding where you want to go and when and then searching for the lowest fares, Ma says building a trip around a rock-bottom fare, wherever and whenever it's going, can provide an unexpected, bargain-priced vacation. \n\"Not everyone has that kind of flexibility,\" says Ma. \"If you do, you're going to find great deals.\" \nTo be a successful \"flash traveler,\" you've got to be the kind of person who gives up dreams of a Caribbean vacation for a cheap trip to Brussels, say, and can toss things into a suitcase, lock the door and hit the road on short notice. \nThat excludes most parents of school-aged kids, who are stuck traveling during school vacations. \n\"Summer is a tough time for deals,\" says Ma. \"It's very expensive and the bargains are fewer, because it's when so many people are locked into traveling.\" \nThere's good news ahead for those who want to travel to Europe during Thanksgiving or Christmas holidays though. \"We expect to see very cheap flights then,\" says Ma. \nRegardless of where you'd like to travel, there's no perfect solution for searching airfares. You've got to do your homework. \n\"No one should ever check just one site,\" says Ma. \"Pricing varies from one site to another. Check Google Flights, check Kayak.com, check us. That way, you'll have the best shot at finding the best fare.\" \nThere are a number of cheap fare apps available as well. Here are a few: \n— GTFO, (Get the Flight Out), is an update of the Flight Tonight app. It offers up a changing mix of same-day options for round-trip flights to U.S. and international locales. \n— Last Minute Travel Deals: This app promises savings of as much as 60 percent on hotels, flights, car rentals, tourist destinations and sporting events in cities worldwide. \n— Hopper: Hopper's ad line is \"Save Money With the Bunny.\" The app analyzes billions of flights to help you find the best deals and the best times to buy and fly.
