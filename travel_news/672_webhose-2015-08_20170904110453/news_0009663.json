This breakthrough is engineered to make shipping on hangers, commonly known as \"Garments on Hanger\" (GOH) far more efficient and will allow retailers to replace the billions of one-use, virgin plastic hangers now going into landfills every year. Steve Akre , OIA's EVP of Business Development said \"retailers can reduce shipping and warehousing costs up to 20% and achieve significant sustainability advances using the Garments on Ditto program.\"\nThe key component to the program is the Ditto hanger, made from 100% recycled paper fiberboard. The hanger is extremely durable and has marketing and retail benefits not possible with plastic hangers. Gary Barker , Ditto's founder and CEO noted, \"People think plastic store hangers are used repeatedly but once the garment is sold, there's no reuse.\" Studies show that 85% of retail plastic hangers are thrown out resulting in a staggering 34 billion hangers going into landfills annually. \"With the single use plastic hanger actually costing almost 10 cents more per garment to ship, sell, and dispose of, retailers are paying a premium to send tons of plastic to our landfills,\" Barker noted.\nThe Ditto and OIA \"Garments on Ditto\" program launches on September 1 st .\nAbout OIA Global: Since its founding in 1988, OIA has grown into a $1 billion supply chain leader delivering clients a unique combination of global logistics, materials sourcing, and packaging solutions.
