More than 900 runners will start down Runway 1 (13L/31R) of Liszt Ferenc International Airport on Saturday 5th September 2015 to decide who is the quickest among airport employees; the fastest airline team or the fastest running aviation executive.\nRunway Run has become a unique airport and aviation sports event in Europe since there is no other occasion when athletes can run an otherwise active airport runway. This is also a nice informal opportunity for aviation industry professionals to meet and get acquainted not only with the best airport in Eastern Europe (Skytrax 2014 and 2015 award) but also with Budapest and its surroundings. More than 170 foreign professionals have registered for the event and will fly in just to participate in Runway Run.\nThis year the runners will have to run either 5 or 10 kilometers up and down the runway (closed from 7.00 to 15.00 hours just that day) or in a team relay of 5+5 kms each. Altogether more than 900 runners have registered for the race including many sports people from Budapest Airport itself, airlines employees, top managers from the aviation industry, key partners of the airport and representatives of airport authorities (police, customs, anti-terrorist squad of TEK, CAA, firefighters and even ambulance).\nProceedings from the registration fee will go in case of foreign participants to support Anthony Nolan Foundation, a UK-based bone-marrow transplant charity and in case of the Hungarians will go to “Suhanj!” Foundation whose members help and create sporting opportunities for disabled young people. The main sponsor of this year’s Runway Run is Airbus Industries from Toulouse, France and there are many other airport partners who help to make this event successful.\n“I am sure that Runway Run 3.0 will again deliver a unique running experience for all participants.” says Jost Lammers, CEO of Budapest Airport who has at least one full marathon behind him. He added: “I expect a tough race this year since I know that many of my colleagues, airport and airline executives will be among the runners so all want to capture a special prize this year again. I was surprised to find out just how many active runners are there amongst the aviation community as well as key business partners and we are happy to host them every year for this special race in Budapest.”\nSource:- Budapest Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:26:42.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
