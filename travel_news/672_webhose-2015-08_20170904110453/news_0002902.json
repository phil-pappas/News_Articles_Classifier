These garden rooms re-opened just last month as part of the gardens’ Late Night Thursday events over the summer period.\nIn the last two weeks alone, more than 4,000 votes have poured in for Dyffryn Gardens.\nSpeaking of the accolade, Property manager at Dyffryn Gardens, Gerry Donovan said: “We are blown away by the support that members of the public have shown for us. We want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has voted for us. Winning special places is such an honour especially as we were up against such beautiful and inspiring places. We hope that from winning lots more people will hear about us so that they can experience the magic of Dyffryn too.”\nSpecial Places ambassador, TV personality and weather presenter, Sian Lloyd will present the team at Dyffryn with their prize today – which includes money for a celebration event and official winners plaque.\nSpeaking of the win, Sian said: “Special Places brought so many famous landmarks to the fore, but it’s easy to see why Dyffryn Gardens stole our hearts this summer and walked away with the prize.\n“The team at the gardens have put so much work into bringing the famous gardens to life over the last few years – the place is steeped in history and it’s very clear it has touched the lives of so many locals and out of towners who come and visit the gardens all year round. There was some amazing competition this year but I’m confident the right winner came out on top!”\nJustin Albert, National Trust Director for Wales, said: “Well done Dyffryn Gardens for securing the win in such a tightly fought contest. All the fine five were winners in their own right and really it’s very hard to pick between any of them. They are all fabulous special places. So, for Dyffryn to win among such exalted national treasures is testament to how engaging the gardens are to the Welsh public.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T12:00:08.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
