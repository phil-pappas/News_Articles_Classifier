Beginning this week, the brand new travel kit, courtesy of La Compagnie, will be available on board to each guest travelling with La Compagnie on both its London-NYC and Paris-NYC routes (return). Created with both male and female passengers in mind, the new kits are made from 100% organic cotton. Chic yet subtle, the amenity kits are blue and grey in colour in alignment with La Compagnie branding. \nSpace is of the essence with these travel bags which unfold to the following dimensions: 27cm x 21cm with a zipper opening of 20cm. In these new kits, passengers will find a selection of products to ensure the most comfortable, seamless and hassle free flight with La Compagnie: cosmetics, eye masks, dental kits, compact mirror, cotton socks, shoe bag, and ear plugs. Cosmetics in these new amenity kits are supplied by French beauty experts, Caudalie, a company that is delighted to offer passengers its luxurious face cream and eye contour treatment range (Premier Cru). Whether guests wish to catch up on the latest films or relax with their favourite album, sound quality is world-class and disruption minimal on a flight with La Compagnie. This same week, it This summer La Compagnie, the boutique all-business-class French airline, will be commandeering 50 iconic black cabs, painting them blue and bringing a bit of luxury to the people of London. 1,000 lucky passengers will hail a cab as usual in the city centre, at City Airport or Heathrow Airport, sink into their seat, sigh with relief to be out of the city heat, and then discover the brand new reviving La Compagnie amenity kit, loaded with Caudalie treats to unwind and relax. Two of these amenity kits will go further than a few miles of bliss. Literally 3,459 miles further. Two passengers will win the ultimate escape from London; a return flight to New York! This trip is not uniquely reserved for those who have already been spoilt with toiletries; passengers are encouraged to take photos of themselves in or with the cab and share them on social media with the hashtag #FlyMeToNYC. All social media entries will be reviewed at the end of August and a third winner will be picked to receive a return flight from London to New York. A fresh, innovative and respected leader in the industry, Buddha Brown Entertainment music label (directed by Venus Brown) has worked with a number of high profile names such as Justin Timberlake, John Legend, The Black Eyed Peas, will.i.am and Janet Jackson. Venus Brown (Director) comments: “Having flown with La Compagnie and having become such a big fan of its offering, I am excited to work with the team to see how we can further improve the quality of entertainment and enjoyment of guests. Et voila! We have developed a set of smart, chic headphones in the colours of La Compagnie with the very best technical quality and sound. We are proud to contribute to the enrichment of the on board entertainment and even happier to combine our expertise with that of La Compagnie, whose unique and innovative business model revolutionises business class as we know it.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:45:30.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
