Offering end-to-end supply chain solutions, Transportation Insight has also been recognized as part of the Inc. 5000 Honor Roll, a designation for a select few companies who have been honored on the Inc. list for at least five years in a row. Fewer than 200 of the 5000 companies on the 2015 Inc. list have been honorees among this elite group of prominent brands for eight years or more.\nInc. Magazine ranked the Inc. 500|5000 according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2011 revenues to 2014 revenues. These numbers represent an impressive growth rate that is uncommon for a company 15 years in business. By achieving 143% sales growth since 2011, Transportation Insight is the largest Enterprise Logistics Provider, by gross revenue, on the Inc. 5000.\nFounder and Chairman Paul Thompson says that Transportation Insight's long-term growth is a result of client retention, new client acquisition and strategic investments to strengthen an already appealing service portfolio. \"Our long-term strategy of investing in best-in-class technology and building the strongest intellectual capital base in the logistics industry continues to pay dividends in the form of prolonged rapid growth,\" Thompson says. \"Our ability to help clients to continuously improve their operations and grow faster than the economy depends totally on our people and their passion for developing and executing logistics and technology solutions that simplify the complex process of managing a global supply chain.\"\nTransportation Insight's robust portfolio of services includes consultative and transactional supply chain solutions. The company delivers Tier One domestic truckload, less-than truckload and parcel logistics solutions, along with comprehensive international logistics services, an extensive North American warehouse network and a blended technology platform that delivers a complete view of the global supply chain from factory floors abroad to the end customer's door.\nTransportation Insight's sustained rapid expansion is a particularly notable achievement for a company of its size. Founded in 1999, Transportation Insight has been nationally recognized for its achievements in supply chain analytics and technologies, Insight Fusion® Big Data solutions and Extended LEAN® continuous improvement methodologies. The North Carolina -based company has thrived through several of the most challenging years in the American economy.\nTransportation Insight President and CEO Chris Baltz says the company's inclusion in the Inc. 5000 for an eighth straight year is a direct result of strategic partnerships with forward-thinking clients. \"Our mantra at Transportation Insight is that we make companies better – significantly better – when they partner with us,\" Baltz says. \"But, our client partnerships have also resulted in Transportation Insight becoming a significantly better company. The collaborative best practices of our clients and our associates create powerful synergies that result in sustained competitive advantage, increased enterprise value and elevated market position for all involved – a true win-win.\"\nThe lead logistics provider recently marked its 15 th anniversary and expects to strengthen its place on the Inc. Honor Roll as it continues to execute on its growth strategy branded Vision 20/20. The plan outlines Transportation Insight's goal to become a $3.5 to $5 billion company by January 1, 2020 , through continued aggressive organic and acquisition-related expansion.\nBaltz adds, \"We are honored to receive this recognition on the Inc. Honor Roll. Transportation Insight continues to succeed because our people are executing better than the competition with a dedication to help our clients win.\"\nAs a member of the Inc. 500|5000 list, Transportation Insight shares alumni status with innovative companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Pandora, Under Armour and Patagonia to name a few.\nView Transportation Insight's Inc. 5000 profile online at http://www.inc.com/profile/transportation-insight .\nAbout Transportation Insight, LLC\nTransportation Insight is a global lead logistics provider with more than $3.6 billion in supply chain spend under management.
