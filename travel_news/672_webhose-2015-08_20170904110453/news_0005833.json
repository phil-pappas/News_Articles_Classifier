Our vision for Frances Bay would support fishing, tourism and harbourside living while creating new jobs for Territorians.”\nThe site is owned and operated by the Territory Government and the Department of Lands and Planning will be seeking feedback on its future use from business until September 30.\nThe ‘Gobi Desert’ is reclaimed land and developers will be able to consider further reclamation.\nThe city council’s Darwin City Centre Master Plan envisages an enhanced marina in the area and Lands and Planning Minister David Tollner said he would be interested in seeing this for the site.\n“The Duckpond has 85 berths and is at capacity during the wet season, so expanding facilities in Frances Bay will be high on the agenda,” Mr Tollner said.\n“As well as testing the market for development, we’ll also be talking to the Duckpond’s existing users to make sure their future needs are at the heart of this development.”\nThe market sounding process allows proponents to indicate their interest and formally open a dialogue with the Territory Government.\nThe sounding process will be finalised by the end of the year and the public will be kept informed regarding the future use of the site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:22:57.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
