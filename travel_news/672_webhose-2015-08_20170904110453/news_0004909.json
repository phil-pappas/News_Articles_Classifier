But you can be certain its members are going to give the job everything they’ve got — including sharp teeth, long claws and a thousand pounds or so of force.\nEight grizzly bears at the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center play a role in testing food storage and garbage containers destined for outdoor use in bear country. This tough team isn’t made up of just any bears — these are grizzlies that have been removed from their habitats for being “nuisance bears” or because their mothers were deemed to be nuisances. And they’re perfect for giving products such as coolers, food sacks and pack kitchens the bear stamp of approval.\nA bear at the Grizzly & Wolf Discovery Center in Montana tests out a product. (Photo: Kurt Groen/Dick's Sporting Goods)\nThe program was begun in 1989 by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC). The goal of the committee, which is comprised of state and federal agencies, is the recovery of grizzly bear populations and their habitat in the lower 48 states.\nManufacturers apply to have their products put to the grizzly test.\nIn the past five years, applications have grown from about 25 to 80 per year, says Scott Jackson, national carnivore program leader of the northern regional office of the U.S. Forest Service, which is one of the federal members of the committee.\nBefore being tossed to the bears, the container undergoes a preliminary visual test that includes looking for any sharp protrusions or loose parts that could harm the animals. The product is then given a healthy dose of bear kryptonite (peanut butter or honey that’s applied in or on the container), and then put into the habitat to be scratched, bitten, jumped on and tossed around for the next 60 minutes.\n“It’s also really simulating and enriching for the bears,” Jackson notes. “It provides them with something to occupy their minds.”\nIf the bears can use force or teamwork to break the item open (ever seen two big bears pulling at the same food sack?), the product fails the test.\nBut if the item is able to withstand the force of the grizzlies (who weigh in at 700 pounds to 1,000 pounds), the container passes.\nJackson says products are approved about half of the time.\nFind more tips and advice to make your next outdoor adventure a great one in USA TODAY's Hunt & Fish magazine, on newsstands through Sept. 26.
