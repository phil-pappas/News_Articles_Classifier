The property, originally named the Nautilus Hotel, was designed in the 1950’s by famed architect Morris Lapidus. SIXTY Hotels has designed and restored the hotel; instilling contemporary elegance while preserving key elements of Lapidus’ design legacy. \nJason Pomeranc, a pioneer in the boutique hotel industry, and his partners, brothers Lawrence and Michael Pomeranc and long-time collaborator Stephen Brandman, launches Nautilus as the first new opening under their hotel brand, SIXTY Hotels. Nautilus, a SIXTY Hotel captures and reimagines the era’s sophistication, elegance and ease in design, programming and vibe. The complete transformation reflects a vision of residential living, drawing design inspiration from the original era as SIXTY Hotels imbues the hotel with mid-century jet-set style furniture, layered with art deco and contemporary pieces inspired by global beach culture; creating a hospitality experience that resonates with today’s traveller and preserves the inherent charm of this landmark. Lapidus’ signature neo-Baroque designs that are synonymous with Miami remain - including the lobby’s landmarked “stairway to nowhere,” to the return of the infamous Driftwood Room and Lounge. The expanse of the hotel grounds stretches from Collins Avenue to the Beach, and stands eight stories high. Upon arrival, the hotel’s entrance with 25 Ft ceilings leads guests from the arrival area to the lobby with the sunken bar area, Driftwood Room and Lounge, featuring the restored ”stairway to nowhere”. A corridor with a gallery wall for art activations leads to a multifunctional event space, designed with cues from Yacht salons, which divides into two rooms for private functions and opens as a private lounge. The 200-seat Signature restaurant with celebrity Chef, also designed with mid-century roots offers a private dining room for 14, enjoys natural daylight and views of the pool from the outdoor terrace. The salt-water swimming pool with bar is surrounded by cabanas; and a playful lawn setting with Bolivian hammocks overlooks the beach, with private chairs for beach service. The crisp and comfortable 250 guest rooms and suites are draped in neutral colours, and feature 48 Inc Flat Screen, vintage-style mini bar chests, and custom artwork from notable American photographer Sante D’Orazio. Many rooms and suites feature spacious balconies with ocean views. A Penthouse sits on top of the eighth floor, and includes two bedrooms, a dining area, kitchen, and a stunning garden terrace. Nestled in the heart of South Beach’s most desirable neighborhood, Nautilus, a SIXTY Hotel is walking distance to some of the area’s best galleries, theaters, boutiques, bars and restaurants.
