A new microsite, will showcase Singapore’s lesser known appeals to the world’s travel trade.\nDaryl Lee, GTA’s Regional Vice President for Sales & Marketing in APMEA, says: “Have you found or heard of hidden gems in Singapore? Not afraid to let others in on the secret? Can you tell us about it in a creative and inspirational way? Then join our campaign to widen the appeal of Singapore among the world’s travellers and have the chance to enjoy one of the biggest and most exciting events in the world.”\nAgents are being encouraged to upload a creative 30-second video about the hidden gems to be discovered on a visit to Singapore. GTA is looking for inspirational films that will encourage travellers to explore more than just the usual highlights like Marina Bay, the Supertree Grove or the Merlion. Films might focus on out-of-the-ordinary experiences by day or night, unusual excursions, culinary recommendations or even the unique attractions of particular hotels. Most important is the personal insight and recommendation given by the travel agent.\n“Travellers of today are becoming more discerning, and Singapore has much to offer in terms of in-depth experiences that showcase our unique character and heritage. GTA’s initiative is a creative platform to highlight off-the-beaten track experiences, and a great example of innovation within the travel agent industry,” says Ms Ong Ling Lee, Director, Travel Agents and Tourist Guides, Singapore Tourism Board.\nGTA will choose ten lucky winners based on the variety and uniqueness of their destination insight and pay for them to visit Singapore1 and recreate their video over five days. The trip will also coincide with the 2015 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix, so winners will get three-day premier walkabout access to enjoy the race and concerts from different vantage points.\nThe world’s travel trade will also be encouraged to ‘like’ videos on the website and the ten most popular will receive a 38mm Apple Watch with Sport Band. The site will also inspire those who have never been to Singapore as they can see what locals recommend on the website.\nGTA’s strategic partnership with hotels throughout the destination will also see the campaign promoted direct to travellers online and in social media. The strategic partnership program aims to highlight value for money travel and drive visits to the destination from key markets in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. Focusing on markets within seven hours flying distance from Singapore, travel agents in cities in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and the UAE as well as secondary cities in China, India and Indonesia are being targeted through GTA’s extraordinary reach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:09:27.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
