Bohunt is in the large village of Liphook in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire in the south of England. Five native Chinese teachers accepted the task of teaching these British students using a Chinese format of structured schedules and teaching styles in their classrooms. Four female teachers and one male teacher taught 50 British ninth graders for four weeks. Classes began at 7 a.m. and often didn't finish until 12 hours later. Morning exercise became a part of the daily routine, along with the students learning facial exercises to relieve stress and fatigue. Also, the Chinese math teacher, Simon Zou, gave each student a Chinese ring puzzle and challenged them to solve it. They learned all of their normal subjects plus they were introduced to Mandarin via a Chinese class. It is well known that Chinese students excel in many areas their Western counterparts do not The documentary set out to show the contrast between a traditional Chinese teaching style versus the teaching style of British teachers. Here are my observations and comments regarding this first part of the series (the other parts will air later this month) . First, it is interesting that the British are forced to look to Chinese education to find ways to improve their own educational system. It is well known that Chinese students excel in many areas that their Western counterparts do not, particularly in the sciences and math. These areas of study eventually lead to occupations that include technology, science, engineering, computer science and other jobs that require more linear thinking rather than creative or critical thinking. Second, the documentary is (to me) only partly believable. The behavior of the students seemed staged. I learned through a little research that in Liphook, “amateur drama has been a feature of village life since before World War II. Liphook Amateur Dramatic Society (LADS) existed at least between the 1930s (revived 1955) and 1969. Two companies currently (2014) exist - Liphook Amateur Productions (LAMPS) and The MAD (Methodist Amateur Dramatic) Company – \" to Quote: Wikipedia. If this truly is an objective depiction, it must be a dreadful school. I'd never let my child attend... The students blatantly misbehaved in front of the cameras. Students were quite rude, which I would say is certainly not normal from what I know about most British people (and especially students). Third, if this video is truly an objective depiction of Bohunt School, it must surely be a dreadful school. I would never allow my child to attend such a place. However, I sincerely doubt that it is that bad. The video likely shows a bias by the BBC or the producer against the government and/or the education system in England. Fourth, the 'truth' about all Chinese students and classes being as 'perfect' as is portrayed in this video, is also inaccurate. I've been teaching here for four years. I've had the opportunity to visit and teach in many schools as part of a company that places foreign teachers. I was utilized as kind of a 'clean up' and research agent in places where classes were not going well and where foreign teachers were not giving their best efforts. I've taught more than 2,000 students, trained 300 Chinese English teachers and given over 2,100 lessons/lectures at every level of school from grade one primary school through the MBA candidates at Zhengzhou University. I've had to expel students from classes, have had to have conferences with their parents over their misbehavior and on one occasion, I had to demand that a certain student never return to my class. Chinese students are, overall, much better behaved, calm and obedient in the classroom Now, with that said and in always trying to maintain objectivity in my opinions and assessments, Chinese students are, overall, much better behaved, calm and obedient in the classroom. In fact, it is the nature of Chinese people to be this way. However, in this video, there is a portrayal of 'perfection' in Chinese schools and classrooms. It is good, but, not perfect. The video shows both, a classroom and daily structure in addition to teaching styles. When you hear that Western students are allowed to challenge the teacher, any sane teacher would not allow them to challenge from a standpoint of misbehavior or outbursts of rudeness as shown in the video. Teachers allow students to challenge concepts, ideas, opinions and the like. This is part of the critical thinking process that's encouraged in the West. The aim is to teach students to be innovative, not rude and undisciplined. My overall opinion is that the West can learn a lot from China in education. I don't know the final outcome of the Bohunt experiment. We will see in the final episodes. However, I predict that the students will fare much better on exams than those who were not taught in the environment of the experiment. Much of the reason will be that they spent more time studying. Balance must exist in every area of life: in education, the workplace and one's personal life My personal belief is that the biggest benefits of Chinese secondary education are 1. longer hours at school. 2. Competitiveness. This is more important in China because there are so many job seekers looking for employment in a highly competitive job market. 3. Higher expectations and demand upon students. 4. More lecture based lessons. This is great preparation for college. Effective note taking is essential for college. 5. Team building. This too creates an intellectual environment where synergy is created in addition to developing personal attributes such as tolerance, cooperation and harmony. My last comment is that balance must exist in every area of life: in education, in the workplace and in one's personal life. In these comparisons, such as the one in this video, most people don't think beyond substantiating a very narrow opinion. They walk away with conclusions based on information that may or may not be accurate. They don't dig deeper. Many Chinese will walk away believing that the Chinese system is far superior to Western education. Let me say again, I don't know what classrooms are like in the UK, but, I know that the behavior of students in these videos is far from what students are actually like in the USA. I believe the video is obviously biased. There is much to learn. Objectivity, accuracy, honesty, interaction, fairness and cultural considerations are all vital in making any conclusions.
