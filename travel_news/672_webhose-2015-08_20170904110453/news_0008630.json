I expect that this will be a real boost for tourism to India because obviously it simplifies the visa process and makes it a lot fairer for prospective travellers. It also means people can book last minute too. \n“I suspect the Indian authorities did listen at that meeting - several operators voiced their concerns and hopefully the message was made clear that India was losing market share to neighbouring countries.” \nJohn Telfer, Explore product director, agreed: “This is absolutely excellent news, I’m sure this change will boost tourism to India among UK tourists. \n“I am delighted that the High Commission took onboard tour operators’ concerns - not only will it be faster and less hassle for travellers to get a visa, it will also be significantly cheaper.” \nWendy Wu Tours marketing manager Ben Briggs said the change would make the operator’s life easier, as they sorted out the visas for travellers taking an escorted tour of the country. “It is going to raise the profile of India,” he added. “I would definitely expect to see an increase in interest from consumers too.” \nTitan Travel director of product and operations Andy Squirrell added: “It is a massive stride forwards. Anything that makes it easier to visit has got to be a good thing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:42:13.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
