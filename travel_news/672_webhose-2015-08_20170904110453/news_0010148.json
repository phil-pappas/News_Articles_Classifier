But not all the new features and programs are permanent. \nCruise expert Stewart Chiron ( cruiseguy.com ) says what the cruise lines are after is the “Disney factor,” noting that when Disney Cruise Line debuted with character appearances and such, the line immediately commanded higher fares. “Disney gets premiums because it is Disney and other lines try to chase that Disney magic,” Chiron tells USA TODAY. “But the reality is when consumers aren’t willing to pay more some of these programs go the way of the Dodo Bird.” \nHere are some cruise offerings that just didn’t stick. \nNickelodeon Characters: SpongeBob is leaving and so is Dora the Explorer. Norwegian Cruise Line has ended its deal with TV network Nickelodeon to have its costumed characters, and such activities as getting “slimed,” on its ships. The program will be gone from Norwegian Epic in November and from four other ships including Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway by the first of the year. Norwegian is taking a different route with its family programming, the line said. \nChef Geoffrey Zakarian’s Restaurants at Sea: A judge on Food Network’s Chopped and an Iron Chef , New York restaurateur Zakarian opened Ocean Blue, the Raw Bar and a takeout stand selling gourmet lobster rolls and fish chips on Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway. The restaurants remain; Zakarian is seeking other opportunities in the cruise industry, according to a statement. Norwegian contracted another “Iron Chef”, Jose Garces, for seafood and tapas restaurants on its soon-to-debut Norwegian Escape. \nDynamic Dining: Royal Caribbean built its high tech Quantum-class ships including Anthem of the Seas (soon to debut in the New York market) sans main dining room and instead with a bunch of smaller themed restaurants, each with its own menu – some complimentary and others for a fee. The program was set to expand to other ships in the fleet, a move that required both design changes and changing the psyche of passengers. It proved hard to pull off. The result: Only Quantum-class has Dynamic Dining – and even then passengers can choose Dynamic Dining Classic, which replicates the main dining room experience (you get the same dining time and tablemates nightly). \nBon Appetit on Oceania Cruises: When Oceania Cruises launched the Marina and Riviera it was with the first real cooking school at sea – developed with Bon Appetit magazine and featuring a classroom with 10 cooktops. In the space, students work in pairs and actually do hands-on cooking with a visiting chef instructor. Under the guidance of consulting chef (and Culinary Institute of America instructor) Katherine Kelly, the program remains and has expanded with classes shipboard and onshore. But there’s no longer an affiliation with the magazine. \nBlue Man Group: Innovative, hysterically funny and very blue, this land-based brand debuted its raucous show/party in a custom-built, state-of-the-art theater on Norwegian Epic in 2010. The experience included live music, comedy and techno-theatrics, splashes of blue paint and Twinkies. The run ended this spring. Coming to the theater in October is Priscilla, Queen of the Desert – The Musical , the story of two drag queens and a transgender woman traveling across Australia and featuring such classic dance tunes as “It’s Raining Men,” and “I Will Survive.” \nDancing with the Stars: At Sea: Holland America Line aligned with the popular ABC TV show for this dancing program, which has passengers paired with professionals to compete in a fleetwide event – with a Mirrorball Trophy awarded annually on a champions theme cruise. Celebrities including Carson Kressley and TV mom Florence Henderson (Mrs. Brady) will be onboard the “Dancing With the Stars: At Sea” Champions Cruise on the Nieuw Amsterdam, departing Fort Lauderdale on January 10, but after that the program is going away. HAL President Orlando Ashford said it’s been “an amazing run.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T02:59:31.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
