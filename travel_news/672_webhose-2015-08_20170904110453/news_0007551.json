Cameras to catch the multi-hued spectacle are a must and the seven-day-a-week display will be free to view – and smell!\nPlanted and ready to burst into bloom in early spring, the display garden has required months of advanced preparation and planning.\nThe Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan, located between Camden and Campbelltown, is the largest botanic garden in the country, spanning 416 hectares, providing the perfect space to showcase the delicate daisies. The flowerbeds are situated at the base of the Connections Garden and have drawn thousands of people each spring since the first display appeared more than 20 years ago.\nSpecies planted as part of the display include ‘rosy everlasting’, ‘mangles everlasting’ and ‘showy everlasting’. The species are native to Western Australia and provide a display of what one would expect to see when visiting Australia’s west in spring. In the full glory of its plumage, the array of daisy flowers in a colourful mass planting is nothing short of breathtaking.\nThe Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan also features 20km of walking tracks, lakes, gardens, parks and a spectacular Stonehenge-type sundial. It is also the only botanic garden in the world to feature a mountain bike track open to the public. The garden also boasts outdoor sculptures, free gas barbecues, a restaurant and a gift shop that sells plants. Admission is free, with the gardens open 8am-5pm daily.\nSource:- Macarthur Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:26:01.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
