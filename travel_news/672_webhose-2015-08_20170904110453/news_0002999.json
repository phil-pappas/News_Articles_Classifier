Scheduled to open in December of 2016, Aloft Dallas Love Field and Element Dallas Love Field will anchor a new mixed-use development just one mile from Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) and the Dallas Medical District. \n\"Aloft and Element will bring new energy to the Dallas Love Field lodging market by offering travelers the choice of two distinct lifestyle brands in close proximity to the airport, the central business district and leading attractions,” said Brian McGuinness, Senior Vice President of Specialty Select Brands for Starwood. “An industry leader in the eco-space, Element fuels a life of balance with its emphasis on wellness and sustainability, while Aloft is designed to meet the needs of the evolving global traveler with its unique design aesthetic and live music scene at the W XYZ® Bar.” Aloft and Element Dallas Love Field will be constructed within one multi-story building with a common entry, but separate ground-floor public areas and elevators. The hotel will have shared facilities, including 6,500 square feet of meeting space, an outdoor swimming pool and a state-of-the-art fitness center. The building, which is expected to receive the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, will be part of West Love, a 37-acre development that will also feature apartments and more than 24,000 square feet of retail space. Just one mile from baggage claim, the new hotels will offer proximity to downtown Dallas, the Dallas Medical District, the Design District, the shops and restaurants at Dallas Market Center and AT&T Stadium. Aloft Dallas Love Field will provide leading-edge design, 133 loft-like rooms and accessible technologies. Amenities will include re:fuel, Aloft’s one-stop grab & go food and beverage area, and W XYZ® bar, which will feature local emerging music artists as well as some of the hottest bands as part of Aloft’s popular Live at Aloft Hotels programming. Element Dallas Love Field will feature 91 light-filled studios with a fluid design of modular furniture, fully equipped kitchens, and spa-inspired bathrooms. Guests will be able to stay on the move with Element’s complimentary bikes-to-borrow, and enjoy the brand’s signature complimentary RISE breakfast and RELAX evening reception. The first major hotel brand to mandate that all properties pursue sustainable certifications, Element is recognized as an industry leader in the eco-space and offers travelers a fresh, reimagined interpretation of the extended stay hotel experience. “This dual-branded Aloft and Element hotel development will help meet accelerating demand for high-quality lodging generated by the rapid growth of the Dallas Love Field Airport and the Dallas Medical District,” said Perry Molubhoy, CEO of Atlantic Hotels Group. “By offering these two popular Starwood brands in one location, we will provide a unique mix of product offerings and amenities that does not currently exist within the immediate vicinity and will capture the rapid growth within these submarkets.” Love Field has experienced a significant increase in passenger growth since 2014. Over the past few months, Southwest Airlines has expanded flights to serve most major markets in the U.S., and Virgin America has relocated its hub in North Texas to Dallas Love Field. The hotel development, which will cost over $40 million, will be co-developed by Civitas and Atlantic and managed by an affiliate of Atlantic. Construction is expected to begin in August. The project is the first of several joint hotel projects between Civitas and Atlantic within the DFW Metroplex. 5G Studios is the architect on the project, and Clark Contractors is the general contractor.
