A mandatory refresher course with assessment will also be required every three years. \n\nLastly, in recognition of their contributions to tourism in Singapore, long-service awards in the form of customised pin badges will be given to guides who have served for 10, 20 and 30 years. \n\nJean Wang, a veteran tour guide and honorary secretary at STGS, said: “This is something that we look forward to. Before this, there weren’t any courses for the existing guides. Also, now there are more funding possibilities for guides so that is a plus.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:07:21.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
