Are you good with names at parties? Because we've got a lot of names and two parties here. What’s the first executive order they’ll issue on the first day in the Oval Office?\nMost Read Stories ESPN video: Percy Harvin opens up about what went wrong in Seattle Amazon angst: from traffic to housing, we’re all worked up It’s election time. Will Howard Schultz run for president? Godden trailing; 5 incumbents move on for City Council Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor still holding out with no end in sight For the candidates taking part in the early forum before Thursday’s prime-time GOP presidential primary debate, the answer is simple: Get rid of those issued by President Barack Obama.\nSays former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, “It’s going to be a pretty busy day. … It will be a real long day.”\nGeorge Pataki says he undid many of the executive orders of Mario Cuomo when he took over as New York governor. “I would do this to Barack Obama’s executive orders.”\nFormer technology executive Carly Fiorini piled on. She says, “I would begin by undoing a whole set of things Barack Obama has done.”\nAmong Obama’s most unpopular executive orders among Republicans are his directives to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and defer the deportation of some people living in the country illegally.\n___\n6:05 p.m.\nThe lesser-known Republican presidential contenders are eager to go after Planned Parenthood.\nAt the Cleveland debate of second-tier GOP candidates Thursday, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said the Justice Department and IRS should investigate the group. He also called on Republicans in Congress to cancel federal funding for the organization, even if doing that sparks a government shutdown.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham denied Democratic charges that the GOP’s concern about the group is part of a “war on women.” The discussion was sparked by undercover videos that show Planned Parenthood officials talking about harvesting organs from aborted babies. Graham said that’s the real war on women.\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki is the lone candidate who supports abortion rights but even he called for defunding the group.\n___\n5:50 p.m.\nIn the early forum, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is the first to launch a thorough critique of Democratic favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton, saying “she represents the third term of a failed presidency.”\nGraham said Clinton would not accelerate economic growth because, he argued, she would not sign the repeal of President Barack Obama’s 2010 federal health care law.\nCutting even deeper, Graham underscored what national polls suggest is nagging doubt about Clinton’s trustworthiness. He noted the questions about the personal email server she used as secretary of state.\n“When Hillary Clinton says, ‘I’ve given you all the emails you need,’ it means she hasn’t,” Graham said.\nGraham, who grew up poor, also poked at Clinton’s claim that she left the White House “dead broke.”\n“I know the difference between being flat broke, apparently she doesn’t,” he said. “Hillary, I’ll show you flat broke. That’s not it.”\n__\n5:30 p.m.\nThe second-tier candidates are trying to show off their conservative credentials on immigration.\nContenders at the early presidential debate in Cleveland on Thursday were asked what they would say to a child whose family could be broken up by deportation.\nFormer Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum has proposed limiting legal immigration along with cracking down on illegal migration. He noted that his father had to wait in Italy for seven years before immigrating legally to the United States and reuniting with his family.\nFormer Texas Governor Rick Perry spoke about the importance of securing the border. Neither candidate said how they would address a child whose parents they’d deport.\nReal estate billionaire Donald Trump surged in the polls after blasting people who enter the United States illegally.\n___\n5:20 p.m.\nFormer technology executive Carly Fiorina is the only Republican presidential hopeful on the early debate’s stage to have never held elected office, and she is playing up her outsider status.\nGeorge Pataki and Jim Gilmore are both former governors in the 2000s. They have been quick to distance themselves from current-day politics. New York’s Pataki has been out of office since 2006, and Virginia’s Gilmore since 2002.\nAsked about the enthusiasm that celebrity businessman Donald Trump, current GOP frontrunner, is tapping into, Fiorina said, “the political class has failed you.”\nLike Fiorina, Trump’s never held elected office.\n___\n5:15 p.m.\nDonald Trump didn’t attend the early debate for second-tier Republican hopefuls. But he’s looming over it.\nThe seven contenders who couldn’t crack the top 10 in polls were asked early-on in the event about the billionaire real estate mogul’s lead in the polls.\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry complained that Trump is running a campaign based on celebrity rather than conservatism. He noted that Trump once supported universal health care.\nFormer Hewlett-Packer CEO Carly Fiorina noted that Trump once backed abortion rights and once supported allowing people in the country illegally to stay. He’s also close to the Clintons.\nBut Fiorina also said Trump has tapped into an anger felt by voters sick of politics as usual.\nTrump will be standing center stage during the prime time debate starting at 9 p.m.\n___\n5:10 p.m.\nThe first line of questioning for the second-tier Republican presidential candidates is humbling at best.\nIn the opening minutes of Thursday’s forum for candidates who didn’t make the 9 p.m. main event, Fox News moderators Bill Hemmer and Martha McCallum ticked through a series of questions that effectively asked: Why are you running?\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki weighed running in 2008 and 2012. He says about those campaigns, “I was ready to lead, but I wasn’t ready to run.”\nFormer Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore says unlike eight years ago when voters elected then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, they’re looking for experience in 2016.\n“I think the times are different now,” says Gilmore, who has been out of office for more than a decade.\n___\n5:01 p.m.\nAnd the first debate question of the 2016 campaign goes to … Rick Perry.\nThe former Texas governor was asked why voters should choose him as the party’s nominee at Thursday’s pre-debate forum.\nTaking part are the seven lower-polling candidates who didn’t make the cut for the prime-time debate.\nThe main event starts at 9 p.m. with 10 candidates, selected based on their rank in five recent national polls.\nPerry said being the powerful individual in the world requires an extraordinary amount of work, and said he’s ready for the job four years after his first run for president.\nThere were only a few people in the seats at Quicken Loans Arena to watch the early debate, which includes Perry and three other current or former governors, a sitting senator from a crucial early-voting state, a former senator and the GOP’s only female White House candidate.\n___\n4:35 p.m.\nThe National Rifle Association will air its first political ad of the 2016 campaign during Thursday night’s Republican presidential debate.\nTheir target: Gun control advocate and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\nThe 30-second spot suggests that the billionaire media mogul is either running for president or wants to pick the next one. The ad says his agenda will be: “Outlaw your snack foods. Drive up your electric bill. Dismantle your gun rights.”\nBloomberg has been a major financier of gun control advocates in recent years, including spending millions backing candidates who favor curbing gun rights.\nThe NRA has spent millions doing the opposite.\nThe NRA said it will spend around $1 million on the ad, which will run on Fox News, CNN and on local television in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. All three are home to early presidential primaries or caucuses.\nThe ad will also appear digitally in those states and South Carolina, another early primary state.\n___\n3:25 p.m.\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul says the indictment of a longtime political aide to his family is “a little bit of a distraction” as he heads into the first Republican debate of the 2016 presidential campaign.\nFederal prosecutors this week unsealed charges against Jesse Benton and two others who worked for Rand Paul’s father during then-Rep. Ron Paul’s 2012 campaign for president.\nThey are accused of conspiring to buy the support of an Iowa state senator just before that year’s Iowa caucuses.\nRand Paul tells WBKO-TV in Bowling Green, Kentucky, that it’s “suspicious that President Obama’s administration is bringing this forward in the middle of a presidential debate.”\nBenton has temporarily stepped down from his role at a super PAC supporting Rand Paul’s White House bid.\nHe says in an email to The Associated Press that he “will return soon when I am exonerated.”\n___\n3 p.m.\nPresident Barack Obama expects a lot of the talk at the first presidential debate of the 2016 Republican primary campaign will be about him.\nBut he’s not clearing his schedule to watch all of Thursday night’s event in Cleveland.\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest says Obama is interested in the arguments that will be made and will be following the news coverage of the debate.\nEarnest predicts most of the debate will be about Obama and his use of his influence. But the White House isn’t preparing responses they can send out right away to criticism leveled by the GOP candidates.\nOn the Republican side, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will be watching the two-hour debate.\nMcConnell says it “should be a lot of fun.”\n___\n1:45 p.m.\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has some advice for the Republican presidential candidates getting ready for their first debate: Be respectful and embrace solutions.\nHaley tells a summer meeting of the Republican National Committee on Thursday that her state is still healing from the horror of June’s racially motivated massacre at an African-American church.\nHaley says that people coming together in the wake of the shooting led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state capital in Columbia.\nThe second-term Republican governor says if that kind of consensus can happen in South Carolina, “just think of what we can do across this country.”\nShe spoke at a GOP lunch just blocks from the site of Thursday night’s debate in Cleveland.\nShe says she’ll be watching for substance and details at the debate. Her message for the candidates: “Tell me how you’re going to solve our problems.”\n___\n12:15 p.m.\nSupporters of Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker are giving him a rousing send-off as the Wisconsin governor heads to Ohio for the first debate of the 2016 campaign.\nCheers of “Go get ‘em, Scott!” rang out from a crowd Thursday at the Wisconsin State Fair, where Walker visited before leaving for Cleveland.\nWalker, looking relaxed in a blue fair polo shirt, jeans and sneakers, said at the opening ceremony he couldn’t miss the first day of an annual event he loves.\nHe also noted that Abraham Lincoln visited the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, the year before he was elected president.\nWalker says he’ll be back at the fair next week to participate in a meat auction, livestock auction and to take his two nieces on the potato-sack slide.\n___\n11: 15 a.m.\nIt’s a big day for Republicans, but Democrats are making some debate news of their own.\nThe Democratic National Committee released plans for its presidential debates on Thursday, announcing the first of six will be held Oct. 13 in Nevada.\nFour debates are planned for early primary states in advance of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.\nThat decision has already prompted complaints from candidates trying to challenge front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton for the nomination.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley says “it would be very foolish for the DNC and bad for our party, bad for our prospects, for us to be the party that limits debates.”\nDates for the final two gatherings are not yet set. But the committee says they will be in February or March.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T01:44:30.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
