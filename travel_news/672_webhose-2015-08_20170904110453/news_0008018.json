Up until now, the Centre has been the bridesmaid to the redeveloped Adelaide Oval, but now it’s in a league of its own.”\nOnce completed, the revamped Convention Centre would be able to host up to 13,000 people.\n“On average these visitors are spending $632 a day which has a flow on effect to our hotels, taxis, restaurants and retail outlets,” he said.\n“We know how important conferences are to the state’s economy.\n“In this year’s Budget, we announced $15 million for the State Government’s Bid Fund, with $5 million allocated to secure conventions.\n“More than $60 million will be pumped into the state’s economy as a direct result of the Convention Bid Fund which has helped attract 14 conventions to South Australia so far.\n“The State Government was right on the money with our investment in the Fund. From the redeveloped Convention Centre, Adelaide Oval, Riverbank and South Australian Health Medical Research Institute, there is immense interest in Adelaide right now.\n“The State Government is extremely committed to creating a vibrant city and we have seen a strong investment interest in Adelaide including four high-end hotels built in the CBD since 2013.\n“These hotels — Ibis Adelaide, Mayfair Hotel, Quest King William South and Quest on Franklin are in addition to another five to be built during the next three years.\n“This sort of investment doesn’t happen by accident. It comes off the back of a lot of hard work by the State Government and the strategic investment of taxpayers’ money.\n“With events like the Santos Tour Down Under, World Cup Cricket and AFL at the redeveloped Adelaide Oval, the Liverpool soccer match, Adelaide Fringe, Clipsal 500 Adelaide, Adelaide Festival and WOMADelaide, we are continuing to see visitors flood into SA.”\nAdelaide Convention Bureau Chief Executive Damien Kitto said the investment in infrastructure in Adelaide – both public and private has certainly piqued the interest of the meetings industry across the world.\n“Now is the time for us to take advantage of, maximise and exploit every opportunity to bring these lucrative events to our state” he said.\n“The State Government’s Bid Convention Fund has been a key component in winning a number of events over the past year for our new world-class Convention Centre.”\nSome of the upcoming conferences include:\nInternational Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) International Symposium\nAusBiotech Conference\nRoyal Australasian Colleges of Surgeons (ACS)\nAustralasian HIV & AIDS and the 2016 Australasian Sexual Health Conference\nAustralian Psychological Society College of Clinical Psychologists Conference 2015\n68th International Astronautical Congress 2017\nAustralian Veterinary Association Conference 2016\nAusMedTech 2016\nInternational Small Islands Studies Association (ISISA) Conference\nA food industries conference\nFinancial Services conference\nWorld Hapkido Seminar and Championships 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:10:04.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
