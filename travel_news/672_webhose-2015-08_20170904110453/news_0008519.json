It serves sumptuous international buffets at breakfast, lunch and dinner. \nThe Kitchen has doubled the number of dishes it serves at its buffets to 30, offering a different theme Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. \nI had dinner there with friends on the night that Asian food was featured. It was quite a spread. While it was predominately Asian, it was not exclusively Asian. \nThere were several other international favourties, as well, including lots of fresh seafood, an extensive salad bar, and an mouth-watering array of desserts. \nThe restaurant features an open kitchen with live cooking stations as well as an excellent wine list, contemporary - yet whimsicle - surroundings, and stunning views of Victoria Harbour and the Hong Kong skyline. \nThemed Buffets Japanese sushi and sashimi station at The Kitchen in W Hong Kong on Asian Feast night.

Tuesday: Asian Feast \nThere is a pan-Asian menu on Tuesdays, with everything from Indian tandoori and Chinese dim to Japanese sushi, Thai curries, and Indonesian satays. Wednesday: Butcher’s Barbeque \nMeat lovers will feel right at home on Wednesdays, when they will find a roasted whole suckling pig, marinated sirloin Angus beef, Grilled Thüringen sausage, Roasted whole salmon filet tamarind, BBQ large squid, and more. Thursday: Japanese Night \nFresh sushi and sashimi plus and a Japanese Robata live grill station serving grilled sanma with teriyaki sauce, and Grilled skirt steak wagyu beef with yuzu cilantro butter are the order of the day on Thursdays. \nYummy Desserts Michael Taylor checks out the innovative presentations at the dessert table.
