The slide is made in Jordan by Jordanians, and will be enjoyed by Jordanians and tourists alike. \nMonaco Business Development and the manufacture/creator, Ziyad Mazzawi Corporation, are preparing to offer a mighty ride highlighting to the world that Jordan is the best destination in the region to visit, work, and play. \nThe largest Slip ‘N Slide will be unveiled at the lowest spot on Earth, at the Dead Sea, Jordan. This one-of-a-kind experience will be offered to hotel and invited guests to experience the craze and adrenaline rush at the lowest spot on Earth at the Dead Sea Jordan. \nThe slide is being created in an effort to highlight Jordan as a family destination and a unique experience for tourist and local families. Mona Naffa, President of Monaco said, “This small yet mighty Kingdom of Jordan is a country rich in history and culture, religious sites, and artifacts, and home to important UNESCO sites. We could not be more thrilled to offer this event to a most deserving region.” \nFollowing the event at the Dead Sea, the event organizers have plans to continue the party by relocating the monstrous Slip ‘N Slide throughout Jordan. Stops will include Amman, Jordan’s capital, a cosmopolitan city with a mix of the old historical sites. Using the Citadel in the middle of the city as a backdrop, the slide will offer a speedy trip down its forefront including a one-of-a-kind blend of old and new scenery. Other stops include Wadi Rum and Petra. The slide will end its tour at Jordan’s only seaside port, the Red Sea, Aqaba. This growing resort living destination has the only 18-hole Greg Norman golf course in the Levant region. \nMs. Naffa added, “Ultimately our mission is to drive economic growth for our youth and our citizens through tourism and destination development. This time we will accomplish our goal with the ‘ride in a lifetime.’” \nModern Jordan was founded by King Abdullah I after World War I. It was then ruled by his grandson, the late King Hussein, for 46 years until his death in 1999. King Abdullah II assumed the throne in 1999, and the country has grown to a peaceful and stable nation. Jordan is a cool destination on its own and open for business. Jordan is also the destination of the new Wonder of the World - Petra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T01:36:29.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
