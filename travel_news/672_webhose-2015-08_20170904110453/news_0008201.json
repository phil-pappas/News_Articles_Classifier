Travel Updates Great Barrier Reef rated better than Great Wall of China, Grand Canyon and the Colosseum by: Robyn Ironside National Travel Writer From: Natural beauty ... the Great Barrier Reef has been ranked second on Lonely Planet’s list of the 500 Best Places in the World.

Sky News 02 Jul 2015 News \nQUEENSLAND’S the Great Barrier Reef has been ranked second on Lonely Planet’s list of the 500 Best Places in the World. \nThe largest living thing on Earth, the Reef recently avoided being declared “in danger” by the United Nations due to concerns about environmental degradation. \nBut Lonely Planet’s Ultimate Travelist ranked the Great Barrier Reef among the world’s must see places, beating the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India and the Grand Canyon in the US. \nThe only place judged more impressive, was Cambodia’s Temples of Angkor. \n“Angkor isn’t just an interesting ruin, it’s a spiritual epiphany in stone,” said Lonely Planet spokesman Chris Zeiher. Spiritual epiphany ... Angkor Wat in Cambodia is the world’s number one must-see destination. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nThe list was compiled from all the highlights found in every Lonely Planet guidebook over the last 40-years. \nEveryone in the Lonely Planet community was then asked to vote on their top 20 sights, and the list of 500 was created based on those that received the most votes. \nIn addition to the Great Barrier Reef, nine other Australian attractions made the Ultimate Travelist. \nThe Twelve Apostles off the Great Ocean Road in Victoria was ranked 12th, followed by Hobart’s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) at number 20. \nCradle Mountain in Tasmania at 32 was considered marginally more spectacular than Uluru (33) and Kakadu National Park came in at 56.
