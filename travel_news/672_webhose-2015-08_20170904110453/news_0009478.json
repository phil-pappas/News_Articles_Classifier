Annually attracting upwards of 25,000 gaming professionals and executives, G2E is the world's largest casino gambling trade show event, where Konami's 11,000 square foot exhibit commands center stage each year with the latest games and technology releases. In addition to the first Frogger slot machines, this year's top announcements include brand new games for both Konami's Neo Contra™ and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS video slots, as well as important new tools and features available through SYNKROS™ casino management system such as SYNKROS Progressive Management (SPM) and player on-demand multi-game tournaments.\n\"Visitors to this year's G2E will have no doubt about Konami's unique role in the industry. We're leveraging our company's gaming entertainment legacy, backed by an operational stability and dedication to product quality that engenders confidence in the global gaming market,\" said Matt Reback , vice president, marketing at Konami Gaming, Inc. \"Because Konami consistently demonstrates its commitment to delivering reliable entertainment value, applied innovation, and high performance, our company has chosen to make noise in the industry through our focus on creating trust and quality.\"\nThe upcoming landmark debut of Frogger themed video slots signifies Konami's latest homegrown IP release from Konami Digital Entertainment to the casino gaming industry. The first Frogger slot machines will be unveiled at G2E on Konami's tall-top Podium Monument™ cabinet.\n\"Frogger has remained one of the world's most singularly recognizable video games for more than 30 years, and players have the chance to experience their favorite Frogger features with a real-money casino spin,\" said Reback. \"While the primary game carries modernized character art paired alongside our proven video slot features and math, the game's mystery Frogger Bonus allows players to relive the classic road and river crossing course in retro-pixelated glory. Arcade-animated tractors push away the reel strips and players are awarded three 'lives' as they watch the frog hop its way to increasing bonus awards across the lower screen and up into the cabinet's upper top box.\"\nKonami's award-winning SYNKROS casino management system will be on display as a live environment for G2E guests to test and explore the latest tools and features. One of SYNKROS' latest releases is the industry's first player on-demand multi-game tournaments. It is delivered through Konami's True-Time Tournaments™, which allows casino properties to seamlessly manage either SYNKstart™ synchronized slot tournaments or player on-demand tournament entries that players redeem from any enabled slot machine at their convenience.\n\"Player on-demand multi-game tournaments are the newest enhancement to SYNKROS True-Time Tournaments. Konami is the first to offer multi-game options within a slot tournament so operators are able to keep casino promotions fresh and exciting, and players get an added element of thrill and suspense,\" said Reback. \"This is just one example of how SYNKROS continues to deliver the latest features and functions, expanding across more properties and jurisdictions each year with a core focus on stability.\"\nAttendees are encouraged to visit booth number 1154 at the Sands Expo & Convention Center from September 29 through October 1, 2015 to explore these and more important new Konami releases.
