Photographer's Note \nThe Lilac House (Casa Lilás) or Farnel is a restaurant placed in the Largo da Ordem, Curitiba historic center. The house have more than 2 centuries and survive the changes of the city from the old times when horse-drawn carts when change for trams and than from cars. The restaurant is property of Gloria Vargas and her daughter. Gloria sign the menu and serves traditional brazilian food including family recipes. The flagship product is the \"Paçoca de Carne\". The name \"paçoca\" comes from the Tupi word \"posok\" (pronounced /pɔsɔk/) which means \"to crumble\" or \"to shatter\", and is shared with the candy Paçoca (pade with peanuts). The salty dish is a mix of cassava flour with carne-de-sol (sun-dried-beef). Both (candy and salty) dishes seem to be originated from the same Native Brazilian costumes, but have grown to be completelly different products. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T04:23:50.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
