However, this was successfully challenged in the Western Cape High Court.\nThe MEC wrote to the municipality and said: \"The approval of the budget brought by the speaker’s exercise of a casting vote violated section 160 (3) (b) read with section 160 (2) of the Constitution.\"\nSection 160 (2) states that approval of budgets, among other things, cannot be delegated by a local government municipal council but section 3 (b) reads, \"all questions concerning matters mentioned in subsection (2) are determined by a decision taken by a municipal council with a supporting vote of a majority of its members\".\nBut Oudtshoorn argued that casting the deciding vote was lawful in terms of section 30 (4) of the Municipal Structures Act 1998. The section holds that, \"if on any question there is an equality of votes, the councillor presiding must exercise a casting vote in addition to that councillor’s vote as a councillor\".\nDespite the Constitutional Court outcome, the two parties agreed that Oudtshoorn’s 2014-15 budget could not be set aside.\nJustice Dennis Davis, of the Western Cape High Court, had ruled that section (30) 4 of the Structural Act was unconstitutional and invalid because it allowed the speaker to vote twice.\nHe also ordered that the words \"other than a matter mentioned in section 160 (2) of the Constitution\" and \"question\" in the section’s first line be read into the section.\nJudge Davis then said any decision made and adopted by the municipality, including the council’s decision to approve the budget, would not be changed and the new orders would only affect new decisions.\n* This article was amended to indicate that the changes will be made to section 30 (4) of the Local Government Municipal Structures Act only and not the Constitution as orginally reported", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:41:33.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
