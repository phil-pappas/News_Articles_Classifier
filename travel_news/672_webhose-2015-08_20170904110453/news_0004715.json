Climate change is a global problem and we all need to play our part. I congratulate Sydney Airport on their great work,” Minister Hunt said.\nIn addition to achieving Level Two Airport Carbon Accreditation, Sydney Airport has implemented a range of environmental initiatives, including:\nPublishing a five-year Environment Strategy with more than 100 ongoing actions and initiatives to minimise environmental impact and support sustainable growth, as part of its approved Master Plan 2033; Becoming the first Australian airport to release a Sustainability Report this year; Developing an energy and carbon reduction plan to identify new energy saving, greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy efficiency opportunities; Investing significantly to reduce water usage across the airport; Offsetting vehicle fleet carbon emissions by planting trees; Investing to facilitate cleaner, quieter next generation aircraft; and Partnering with Conservation Volunteers Australia to deliver environmentally beneficial outcomes across the local community, including a bush regeneration program at Kamay Botany Bay National Park.\nSydney Airport has also received a number of environmental awards, including from Greenfleet for more than five years of support for its carbon offset program, and East Coles Corporate Performance Award for Best Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) across ASX top 100 companies.\nACI’s Airport Carbon Accreditation is an international and industry recognised certification system designed to assess and recognise participating airports’ efforts to manage and reduce their carbon emissions. It is the only industry-specific, performance-based, voluntary and institutionally-endorsed accreditation label designed specifically for airports.\nSource:- Sydney Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:17:32.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
