Source: AAP\nThe Diamonds will now have the first of two rest days during the World Cup on Monday before they are regrouped into another pool for the qualification matches.\nAustralia’s loss was marred by uncharacteristic errors and sloppy passing as the Silver Ferns were lead by a strong performance from goal attack Maria Tutaia, who shot 34 from 48 attempts and could have done more damage on the scoreboard if she had been more accurate.\nDiamonds coach Lisa Alexander opened with a largely favoured starting line-up, with Sharni Layton getting the starting nod at goal defence instead of Julie Corletto.\nThe Silver Ferns made a shaky start, with Tutaia missing her first two shots at goal, allowing Caitlin Bassett to get the first score on the board for the Diamonds.\nWhile Bassett struggled to find her position early against some tight checking from Silver Ferns defenders Casey Kopua and Katrina Grant, the Ferns were able to push ahead of the Diamonds in the opening quarter as were able to deliver plenty of ball to Tutaia.\nCaitlin Bassett of the Diamonds competes with Casey Kopua.
