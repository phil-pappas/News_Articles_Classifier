A Port Authority police spokesman says 40-year-old Maxie Oquendo was arrested last night. Prosecutors say Oquendo approached the 21-year-old woman on Tuesday as she was coming off a flight from Salt Lake City and told her she needed to undergo a \"secondary security screening.\" Authorities say the woman was brought to a bathroom, told to raise her arms, and was then molested. Oquendo was arrested on unlawful imprisonment, sexual abuse, and other charges. The TSA says he was also fired.
