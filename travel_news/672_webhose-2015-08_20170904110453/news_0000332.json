Highway 49 is just an hour away, so take a day or weekend tour of Gold Country and sample history, quaint towns and scenic attractions along the route. Start your tour at the place of gold discovery in California. In the 1840s, Capt. John Sutter of Sacramento hired men to develop sawmills to supply lumber to his growing empire. James Marshall chose Coloma (local Nisenan Indians called it Cullumah) to cut timber and mill lumber on the South Fork of the American River. Marshall’s discovery of gold on Jan. 24, 1848, would change the course of the nation and speed California’s statehood. Coloma almost overnight swelled to thousands, fueled by gold fever. California’s population would jump from 100,000 in 1850 to more than 400,000 by the 1860s. The Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park should be a first stop for any visitor or California seeking to understand the Gold Rush that brought tens of thousands of new immigrants to the state. Visitors can see a replica of the old sawmill that Sutter commissioned and more than 20 historic buildings, including the jail, mining digs, stamp mills that crushed quartz so gold could be mined, houses, blacksmith shop and old stores. Touring south on Highway 49 is Placerville, the old “hangtown” where frontier justice too often prevailed. It offers a quaint and walkable downtown. For a good lunch stop, try the Powell’s Steamers Restaurant in an 1890s building. In the fall, visit Apple Hill, just east up Highway 50 from Placerville, a fine detour for all things apple, from cider to pies to apple wine. Plymouth traces its history to the 1870s, when prospectors stopped there in search of quartz and gold. For gourmet travelers, the new Taste Restaurant in Plymouth draws rave reviews from around the region. The city has a cute public park with a bandstand, the old Plymouth Hotel and other eateries, all crowding several blocks. From Plymouth, take a detour eight miles east on Fiddletown Road to Fiddletown, which predates Plymouth. Established by prospectors from Missouri in 1849, it quickly grew in the 1850s and 1860s as a center of trade for many mines nearby. Visit the Shenandoah Valley, a growing wine region just east of Plymouth. The area’s more than 30 wineries offer tastings (some of them at no charge), weekend entertainment and, with late summer and early fall beginning to turn the leaves yellow and orange, it’s gorgeous country. Just off Highway 49 are the richly preserved Gold Rush boom towns of Amador City and Sutter Creek. Amador City blossomed with thousands of miners, shopkeepers and restaurant and saloon workers. The Keystone Mine was formed in 1853 by consolidating several smaller claims and produced more than $25 million in gold, with the main shaft reaching 2,600 feet into the Sierra hillsides. Just south, Sutter Creek's quaint Main Street offers a walkable stretch with a wealth of historic buildings dating from the 1850s, many of them marked by plaques offering historical anecdotes — all of them home to busy shops, restaurants and wine-tasting rooms. Stop for lunch or dinner at the Hotel Sutter/Bellotti Inn. Opened in 1860, it is one of the oldest hotels still in continuous operation in the state. Three blocks east of Main on Eureka is the old Knight Foundry, the only water-powered foundry in the United States, which, until recently, was in continuous operation since 1873. Sam Knight designed the water wheel which was used worldwide, powering early hydroelectric plants throughout California, Utah and Oregon. Jackson and Mokelumne Hill are both worthwhile historical stops on your way to another must-stop, Columbia State Historic Park. Columbia was founded in March 1850 by Dr. Thaddeous Hildreth and others who settled and began prospecting. Soon, the newly formed shantytown of Hildreth's Diggings had found the precious metal and more than a 1,000 miners descended on the area. Renamed Columbia, the park preserves the town as a museum of living history. Columbia’s business district is closed to cars — foot and horse traffic only — and businesses, shops and volunteers bring the town to life, much as it appeared in 1855. Pan for gold, take a stagecoach ride, visit blacksmith and livery shops, get a free tour led by period-dressed docents, grab lunch or an ice cream and take in life as it was more than 150 years ago. Best of all, admission, parking and guided tours are free, and open seven days a week all year. A day spent here is easy on the wallet. — Contact Tim Viall at tviall@msn.com.
