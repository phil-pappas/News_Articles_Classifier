Why? Unfortunately, there is no legal limitation to a debtholder's ability to sell portions of their convertible note to third party investors. Moreover, there is no limitation to the speed in which the new third party investor could convert their note. As a result, the Company's capitalization table was terribly affected and an exorbitant number of shares came to market.\n\"I'm from the private sector, so I admit, it took a little time to see how detrimental these conversions were,\" Pereira continued. \"The worst part is, these transactions are legal. But I will not allow this Company to be destroyed by rules allowing a fortunate few to have little regard for the 'many'.\"\nIt's no secret that dilution has been a concern for an extended period of time. So, the removal of legacy debt has been a long standing endeavor for Pereira. An estimated 90% of the market's dilution was directly related to this particular debtholder's convertible note. Fortunately, now that the entire debt has been 'locked-up' in a manner that prohibits the sale of the debt to third party investors, management has time to complete the retirement and extinguishment of this entire debt. Another option of consolidating this debt, along with the few smaller debts, is also available. Either way, the market will no longer be subjected to any further dilution stemming from the sale of this particular debt.\nPereira concluded, \"The fact is, with the integration of Sabre Travel and Leonardo Worldwide , we are finally where we need to be to launch the beta version of Oveedia within the next 10 business days. The equity value of this company should easily one day far exceed the value of the 'locked-up' note. So, it behooves the debtholder to position themselves as a long-term equity player, to take advantage of Oveedia's eventual high level of success.\"\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
