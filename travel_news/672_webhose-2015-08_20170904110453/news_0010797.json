These are the 100 firms that the SBS organisers believe reflect the diversity of Britain’s small businesses , and span sectors from brewing to app-making to skydiving. Most of the companies on this list have never received press coverage – they are truly the unsung heroes of the small-business sector. Many also actively help other small businesses to get off the ground. There’s Dial a Geek, a Bristol-based IT Support company, which provides technical support both to businesses and home users. Since being founded in 2006 the company has helped over 900 small businesses around Bristol, enabling further enterprise in the local area. Then there’s The Tweed Brewing Company in Hyde, Manchester, which was founded by 22-year-old entrepreneur Sam Ward. This start-up also goes out of its way to support other local businesses, buying its hops and malts, van, office and cleaning supplies, and even its tanks and vessels locally. Last year the campaign trended at number one on Twitter on the day and received around 3.5 million views on its Facebook page Over the next 100 days leading up to the big event itself, each of these winners will be featured on the SBS website; it’s a way to keep momentum going and reward the companies helping to spread the word about the event itself. The Daily Telegraph has been a staunch supporter of the initiative since SBS’s inception in the UK in 2013. SBS originated in the States, where it was launched by American Express to raise the profile of small retailers. Chukka Umunna, then shadow business secretary, brought the idea over to our shores but it has since become a cross-party programme. It is the UK’s most successful small business campaign. Last year 16.5 million adults went out to support a small business on Small Business Saturday with 64pc of the UK aware of the campaign. Last year the campaign trended at number one on Twitter on the day and received around 3.5 million views on its Facebook page. This year the organisers hope it will be even bigger. Any small firm looking to take part can download logos, digital banners, a social media guide and toolkits from the website “Although the campaign focuses on one day, the goal is to have a lasting impact on small businesses by changing mindsets, so that people make it their mission to support small businesses all year round. \"Most people in this country own a small business, work for a small business or know somebody who does, so supporting a small business on Small Business Saturday is absolutely personal.” Any small firm looking to take part can download logos, digital banners, a social media guide and toolkits from the website , which can be displayed online or on premises. Businesses around the country will also be able to upload their contact information to the My Small Business Finder feature on the website, promoting their special Small Business Saturday events or promotional offers.
