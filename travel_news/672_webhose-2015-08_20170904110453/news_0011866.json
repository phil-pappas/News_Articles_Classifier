Currently found only on Airbnb , Guarumo will opt to be exclusively listed on PURE's dual database OTA software â€“ Oveedia.\nLocated in historic Monteverde, Pure Hospitality adds a rare property to the Oveedia database , which is one of the most cherished, musician friendly properties in the country. Guarumo marks yet another independent property within the Central American-Caribbean region, choosing Oveedia to be its exclusive OTA.\n\" Sergio Pacheco , a very well-known Costa Rican bass player, as well as a dear friend of mine, has listed his spectacular property, to be solely featured on our database,\" stated Melvin Pereira , President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. \"Not only is this property located in a historic area of our country, it was specifically built with musicians in mind, boasting a professional amphitheater, among other amenities. We are very excited to help visitors discover Mr. Pacheco's property and get Guarumo's name out to professional musicians around the world.\"\n\"My goal was to create an eco-friendly, acoustic haven, that comes with a gastronomic treat,\" stated Sergio Pacheco , owner and creator of Guarumo. \"Our property is located next to the Curicancha Reserve. This offers a peaceful sanctuary to musicians who can awe in natures backdrop while recording music. With the help of Oveedia, we will become the best known, musician friendly destination in Costa Rica .\"\nSituated in Monteverde, an area dubbed the 'jewel in the crown of cloud forest reserves' by National Geographic, PURE Hospitality adds a rare property to the Oveedia database that was originally built roughly 4,600 ft. above sea level, by U.S. Quakers. Monteverde is also home to UGA Costa Rica , a 155-acre satellite campus of the major U.S. University. Referred to as one of the seven natural wonders of Costa Rica , Guarumo is a breathtaking place to visit.\nPereira concluded, \" Pure Hospitality adds rare property to the Oveedia database , just in time to begin the beta testing of our website. With every independent property that contacts us, like Hotel Tango Mar , and now Guarumo, our beta testing will be more thorough and successful.
