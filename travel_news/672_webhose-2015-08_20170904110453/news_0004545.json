By The Associated Press \nBELOIT, Wis. — Police say a second man has been arrested for a fatal shooting in southern Wisconsin last year. \nAuthorities caught up with the man in Lakewood, Washington this week after getting a tip from someone who provided an address. A warrant for the man’s arrest on second-degree reckless homicide was issued in Rock County following the April 2014 death of Raymond Holloway. He was shot and killed while standing outside his grandmother’s house in Beloit. \nAnother man, Jajuan Logan, was earlier convicted in Holloway’s death and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
