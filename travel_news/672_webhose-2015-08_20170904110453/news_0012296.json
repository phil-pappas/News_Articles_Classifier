In addition to this, the new Hosted Buyers attending the show represent 52 countries across the globe.\nRob Davidson, Managing Director, MICE Knowledge comments, “The rise in interest from Hosted Buyers reflects the growing optimism surrounding the global economy, as shown in the latest quarterly poll of senior managers carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit. That survey showed that the balance of respondents who think business conditions are set to improve over the next six months has risen to 22 percentage points, up six from the previous quarter.”\nGraeme Barnett, ibtm world, Senior Exhibition Director commented, “With three months left until the show and Hosted Buyer applications up 38% on last year, this is a great result. We can also confirm that 72% of the new Hosted Buyers signed up to attend organise more than 5 international events per year providing a great business platform for MICE suppliers from across the globe to come together and showcase themselves to this powerful audience of buyers.”\nAccepted Hosted Buyer applications of corporate meeting planners who will attend for the first time have average meetings budgets of $10.1 million each and include major companies such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Microsoft, Britvic Soft Drinks, Peugeot Citroen, GlaxoSmithKline, Fossil, Merck, Lamprel and Unilever.\nDanielle Robbins, Deutsche Bank AG, CB&S, who will attend ibtm world 2015 as a Hosted Buyer comments, “Attending ibtm world is extremely important for my business as it allows me to source suppliers and venues that are reliable, unusual and professional. I’m hoping to make contacts that I can use to arrange conferences abroad as well as at home. I also find that having a personal experience prior to booking a service or venue is important, I feel much more confident recommending something if I have seen it, experienced it or have a relationship with the supplier.”\nSource:-Ibtm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:21:23.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
