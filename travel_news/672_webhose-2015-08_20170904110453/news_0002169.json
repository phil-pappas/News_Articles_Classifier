Boasting 604,000 square miles in space and a population of just three million, Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world, with only five people per square mile. This compares with the world's most densely populated country, Monaco , with 48,000 people per square mile, and the United States with 85 people per square mile.\nNo traffic for more than 60 miles is common in the vast and empty horizons of western Mongolia , where Extreme Bike Tours will run four 15-day guided adventure tours in May and September, 2016.\nOne of the world's last, true frontiers which few foreigners get to visit, Mongolia straddles ancien t cultural crossroads between east and west  - an exotic and fascinating destination licensed riders and also pillion passengers with no riding experience can experience with Extreme Bike Tours on the back of classic Royal Enfield 500cc bullet motorbikes.\nRiding between the remote, frontier towns of Uliastai and Ulgii, the all-inclusive, off-the-beaten-track tour will see riders eat around campfires and sleep in traditional Mongolian yurts at 'ger' camps along the route which stretches through the Gobi Desert and the Altai Mountains. Along the way, riders can meet nomadic herders, gold prospectors and traditional Kazakh eagle hunters who ride horses and train golden eagles to hunt fox and hare.\nDeparting the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar on May 9 and 23, 2016, and September 12 and 26, 2016, the 15-day expedition is now priced at US$5265 per person, twin-share or for solo travellers  - a discount of US$585 if booked before September 30, 2015 . Pillion passengers riding behind friends or crew or in the support vehicle can also travel for only US$4455  - a discount of US$495 , if booked by the same date.\nFares include connecting domestic flights within Mongolia , hotel accommodation at the start and end of the tour in Ulaanbaatar, ger camp accommodation on the road, all meals, use of new Royal Enfield 500cc bullet motorbikes and fuel. International flights to Mongolia are extra. \nFeatured on TV's 'Top Gear' program, in 2011, Extreme Bike also offers itineraries to the Himalayas, Tibet, Bhutan , Rajasthan and southern India and from 2016, also Cuba .\nVisit www.extremebiketours.com \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150804/254443 \n\nSOURCE Extreme Bike Tours\n\n\nRELATED LINKS\nwww.extremebiketours.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:01:01.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
