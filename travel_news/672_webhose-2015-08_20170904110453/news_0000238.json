With the airport run by Los Angeles' airport agency, which also controls LAX, Lovingood says a \"severe decline in activity has cost our region $400 million annually and 8,000 jobs.\" “Once this airport transition is complete, I fully expect ONT to see tremendous growth in terms of added flights, passenger traffic and job growth,” Lovingood said. “That will naturally generate activity and growth at Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville. SCLA is already home to large commercial operators like Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric. SCLA is designed for international air cargo and heavy maintenance, with an extended 15,050-foot runway and does not have the airspace problems of other Southern California airports.” Lovingood praised efforts by Ontario City Council Member Alan D. Wapner and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, as well as the county and San Bernardino Associated Governments, in advocating for local control of the airport. San Bernardino County is a member of the Ontario International Airport Authority. The county has been working with the Congressional delegation and local stakeholders to aggressively advocate for legislation, Lovingood said.
