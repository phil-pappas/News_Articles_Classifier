MH370 vanished in March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers onboard. \n\nA Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 with the registration 9M-MRG takes off from Frankfurt Airport (FRA) in Germany.

The 2m-long object is believed to be a flaperon, according to aviation experts. \n\nRéunion lies on the extreme western edge of the Indian Ocean, where search operations were mainly being conducted based on the last satellite pings of the ill-fated plane. Finding debris of MH370 in this part of the world is therefore a believable notion. \n\n\"The location is consistent with the drift analysis provided to the Malaysian investigation team, which showed a route from the southern Indian Ocean to Africa,\" said Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak in a Reuters report. \n\nBut despite the headway, it is unlikely family members of the missing passengers will find easy answers anytime soon. \n\nThe debris, along with a luggage fragment found in the area, is currently being flown to the French city of Toulouse, where French and Malaysian aviation experts will meet and examine the findings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:14:05.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
