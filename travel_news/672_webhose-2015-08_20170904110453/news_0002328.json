Photograph by: The Japan News , Yomiuri \nUTSUNOMIYA, Japan — One step inside the former quarry site at the Oya History Museum in Utsunomiya and you will feel as if you are exploring ancient ruins. \nOya stone, a type of tuff stone that can be seen across the city’s Oya district, used to be quarried at the site. \nLured by the prospect of cold air, I went down a dark set of stairs at the old quarry and found myself in a vast underground space where there are a group of stone pillars, each one 10 metres (about 32 feet) wide. \nCreated as a result of about 70 years of drilling that started in 1919, the underground space is about 10 metres high and has an area of about 20,000 square metres (about 4.9 acres) — enough floor space for an entire baseball stadium. The temperature at 30 metres below ground is about 13 C even in midsummer. \nThe white stone walls are illuminated by red and blue lights, and lines made in the course of drilling work trace geometric patterns on the walls. Visitors admired the view saying, “It’s so mysterious.” \nUntil around the 1960s, the stonecutting work was done by hand. To cut out a slab of stone measuring 90 by 30 by 18 centimetres ( 35 inches by 11 by 7), workers had to strike the stone with a pick about 4,000 times. \nEach worker could quarry about 10 stones per day, on average, and there reportedly were workers called kodashi who specialized in carrying stones weighing about 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) on their shoulders out of the quarry site. \nLooking up, the ceiling was black, unlike the white walls. \n“The ceiling was blackened by soot because the inside was warmed by fire,” Hiroo Suzuki, 62, the director of the museum, said. \nThe museum also explains that the Oya quarry site was used as an underground military plant in the final days of the Second World War. \nOya stone was used to build the former main hall of the Imperial Hotel, which did not collapse even in the Great Kanto Earthquake, making the stone a sought-after material for various other buildings. \nHowever, with the advent of concrete, the quarrying industry declined. The 119 stone drilling companies that existed around 1970 have now fallen to nine, and among the more than 200 stone quarry sites in the city, only nine are currently used. \nHowever, as a large number of people are attracted by the fantastical space created over a long period of time, the former quarry site is now used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions, and promotion videos of famous artists and movies have been filmed at the site. \nAt a different former quarry site outside the museum there is a huge underground lake believed to have been created by the accumulation of rainwater; a a boat cruising tour of the lake began in April last year. \nIF YOU GO \nThe Oya History Museum exhibits drilling tools and explains the history of Oya stone. At its underground facility, visitors need to be careful about their shoes and clothes as condensation from the cooling of humid air makes the facility’s floor wet from around June to October. Around the Oya district you may see oddly shaped rocks, as well as stores and warehouses built of stone. People who hope to join the underground boat cruise need to apply at Chiikikachi Keikaku (028) 689-8782. \nOpening hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (The entrance gate closes at 4:30 p.m.) The museum is closed during the year-end and New Year holidays and some other periods. \nAdmission: 700 yen (about $5.60) (350 yen – for middle school students and younger). \nFor details, call (028) 652-1232.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:04:34.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
