Six games from the opening day of the Premier League back-to-back… And with that, Match of the Day was, well, back – as was Gary Lineker and the little furry friend that lives under his chin. • The changing face of Match of the Day Within minutes everyone was mulling over the latest piece of psychological brilliance/sneering petulance from Jose Mourinho, debating the finer points of the game’s rules without it ever being clear that anyone was 100 per cent certain of the exact letter of the law, and Alan Shearer was dissecting the first defensive “horror show”, as he called it, of the season. The high summer return of MotD is as comforting as an old jumper that you wish you’d had the courage to leave in the wardrobe for a few weeks but slipped on anyway because, after all, the weather can still turn nippy of an August evening in this country. Chelsea v Swansea was part of the opening bill of the 2015-16 season The sense from the BBC’s first highlights show of the season was continuity. No fancy new introductory graphics package, no sighting of new acquisition Ian Wright, no technological bells and whistles. Business as usual. It felt like football had hardly been away and, of course, the summer recess has shrunk to such a short period that in many ways it hasn’t. For sporting monotheists, these early season weeks are the times of heaven on earth, as they bathe in the light of the omnipresent god football. MotD , no matter what these noisy, happy-clappy new satellite cults may say, remains its church. Polytheists might lament that a sensational Ashes win, the Rugby World Cup, the US Open tennis, the US PGA golf and countless other idols will be left dusty and neglected once the season revs up, but football is a jealous god and will not tolerate worship of any other. There is no escape from football and its coverage: surrender to its love. • Behind the scenes at Match of the Day On the corporeal plane, someone has been working hard on Wor Alan Shearer over the break. The man who was once a byword for bland, say-what-you-see punditry, had raised his game significantly over the last two seasons and the early signs are that he is ready to make another step up this term. Where once Shearer regarded any use of data or evidence in analysis as being strictly for nerds and weeds, he now backs up his assertions with fact. “Watford were involved in zero goalless draws last season ... I was so impressed with Odion Ighalo, who scored 20 goals last season.” Alan Shearer has upped his punditry game He also contributed trenchant opinions where once he coasted on platitudes, for instance in explaining his prediction of Chelsea as title winners by saying: “If Mourinho was in charge of any of the top four clubs then I would go for the one he is in charge of.” Not exactly moving the ball forward in humanity’s pursuit of a Theory of Everything, but a definite improvement from the man who once remarked of Newcastle’s new signing, Hatem Ben Arfa – “nobody knows much about him”, even though the player was already a French international. • Scientific proof that Match of the Day simply doesn’t like Stoke City Particularly in the summer months, when right-thinking Englishmen and Englishwomen are concerning themselves with traditional summer activities, the 90 minutes of football highlights provided by MotD is a perfect weekly dose, and Shearer’s low-impact punditry an ideal gentle introduction. It was nice to have football back in this relatively unobtrusive fashion. Any television show that finds time for interview questions with Claudio Ranieri about rock music and the band Kasabian should always have a place in the nation’s bosom.
