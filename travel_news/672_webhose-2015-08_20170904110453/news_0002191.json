Related Content Luxury hotels create buzz with urban... \nThey're all keepers of honeybees, part of a growing collection of bee-friendly landmarks around the world. \nIn recent years, global hotels have joined the urban bee-keeping trend too, bringing their own honey direct to their tables. \nThat's good news, considering the well documented decline in the bee population in certain geographical areas, notably North America and Europe. \nA number of factors, including disease, pesticides and habitat degradation are attributed to diminishing bee numbers, and the losses are significant. \nThese sweet creatures are the globe's most prolific insect pollinators, whose combined annual economic value to agriculture worldwide is estimated at $167 billion. \nHere's a look at five top luxury hotels creating a buzz in their local communities. \nWaldorf Astoria New York \nOn a rooftop 20 stories above Park Avenue, some 360,000 bees produce more than 136 kilograms (300 pounds) of honey, harvested annually, which not only finds its way into the hotel's menus, but also into treatments at the hotel's Guerlain Spa. \n\"It is an important statement about our concern for the environment, it is educational for our culinary team, and it provides fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs and edible flowers throughout our hotel,\" says David Garcelon, director of culinary at Waldorf Astoria New York. \nWith home-harvested honey, the hotel created Waldorf Buzz beer last year in partnership with the Empire brewing Company; a yet-unnamed new brew with lemon verbena and hops from the on-site garden is slated to be launched this fall. \nTwice weekly, the hotel's Historical Tour stops off at the garden to see the hives and its more than 60 types of herbs, fruit, vegetables and edible flowers. \nOn the menu: The \"Wax Poetic\" and \"Leaves of Grass\" cocktails at Peacock Alley lobby bar and restaurant are both made with Zubrowka bison grass vodka and house-made honey syrup. \nMandarin Oriental, Paris \nParis has been a pesticide-free zone for the past 10 years, making the French capital an attractive urban environment for honey bees. \nWith the help of local organization Apiterra, 50,000 bees reside at the MO rooftop beehive, with last year's sweet haul totaling 25 kilograms. \nGuests who can't get enough of the ooey, gooey and very sweet syrup (in the words of Winnie the Pooh) offered through the hotel's F&B menu can opt into the hotel's eco-initiatives -- such as reusing towels -- to receive a jar of honey to keep. \nOn the menu: The \"Homemade Honey\" cocktail at Bar 8 is made with Yuzu liqueur, jasmine tea with ginger, Champagne and house-made honey. \nW Taipei \nFollowing a good eight months of prep work, W Taipei became the first urban beekeeping establishment in Taiwan when it opened up its 32nd floor rooftop to host some 150,000 busy bees in partnership with Syin Lu Social Welfare Foundation. \nAfter six months and two harvests from the Sweet Reward program, the bee colonies were moved to another downtown building as part of the foundation's larger urban beekeeping project. \nWhatever honey the hotel chefs and mixologists don't purchase from Syin Lu, the foundation (which produced more than 800 kilograms of honey in the first half of the year from 94 hives) either sells or produces soaps with it in their factory manned by disabled workers. \nOn the menu: The \"Detox Martini\" cocktail at WOOBAR is made with green tea-infused Belvedere vodka, Grand Marnier, orange juice, yuzu juice, house-made honey and Sprite. \nFairmont Waterfront, Vancouver \nThe pioneer of in-house honeybee production and supporting global bee health is Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, whose Bee Sustainable program comprises honeybee apiaries at more than 20 properties across the world. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T23:47:37.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
