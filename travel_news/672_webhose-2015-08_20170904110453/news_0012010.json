Bearing in mind that this is probably the quickest way to pour your hard-earned money down the plughole, I was decidedly negative when my son Tom approached me about investing in the next stage of his business, the Idler Academy . I reminded him that, strictly speaking, the term ‘invest’ implies that there would, eventually, be some kind of return. But then Tom emailed me, not only his extremely persuasive business plan, but details of two government-backed schemes whereby I would only lose half my money instead of all of it, should the business fail. Great! So, an offer I could not refuse? The two schemes, Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) , and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) , have been developed to allow small, high-risk businesses to grow, especially where banks are reluctant to lend. In both schemes, tax relief is available at a percentage of the share price. If asked whether it is a good idea to invest in your child’s business, the answer from every sensible person would be a resounding 'no'! The SEI was introduced in 1994 with the express aim of encouraging private investment into limited companies. Individual investors can claim tax relief at 30% with a minimum investment of £500. Investors in this scheme cannot be connected in any way with the company. Generally speaking, the shares must be held for a minimum of three years after they were issued, after which, if the company actually starts to make money, any dividends are exempt from Capital Gains Tax . The highly popular SEIS was introduced in 2011 by Chancellor George Osborne . It is specifically aimed at companies in their first two years of trading which are looking to raise a maximum of £150,000. The company must hold assets of less than £200,000 and employ fewer than 25 people. The SEIS allows family members to invest up to a 30% stake and here, there is 50% tax relief on offer should the company go down the pan. So if you invest, say, £2000, you can claim back half of this from HMRC . In Tom’s words, ‘at worst, you will only lose half of your money.’ He added: ‘We could put in some sort of agreement that said if and when we issue dividends to shareholders, you would get your share.’ Well, I should hope so. If I did invest, I would want to be treated in the same way as any other investor. Both schemes are highly complicated, tax-wise and if you are interested in giving your entrepreneurial children a helping hand, you should bring in an impartial outsider such as your accountant to discover how it would work in your case and what level of tax relief would apply. If you invest, say, £2000, you can claim back half of this from HMRC. In Tom’s words, ‘at worst, you will only lose half of your money.’ You must look carefully at the business plan and try to assess whether your investment is ever likely to yield any short or medium-term return. With both these schemes, you are only allowed to trade within certain sectors, and it will take at least eight weeks for approval from HMRC to come through. It goes without saying, or should, that as a parent or grandparent, you must never invest more than you can afford to lose. You might even consider your investment a gift on which you will never expect a return. Then there is the question: how will my child face me if the business fails? Although with both the EIS and SEIS schemes, the risks are reduced because of the tax relief , they do not disappear altogether and there is never any guarantee that the business will prosper. That is why, even if you are tempted to help your offspring get their business off the ground, and have the spare money to do so, treat it as you would any other investment opportunity and never let sentiment or emotion come into it. Otherwise a soppy sentimental parent could find themselves in the same situation as Nathan Deal, governor of Georgia, who invested $2 million in his daughter’s company, and guaranteed a bank debt of $2 million more, only for the business – an outdoor sports goods store – to file for bankruptcy in 2009 and all the money invested to be lost. Before making a decision, I will run the idea past my extremely cautious accountant, but I fear I can see him slowly shaking his head already.
