And Republicans in Congress have seized on the involvement of federal law enforcement in the matter as a sign she was negligent in handling U.S. secrets.\nWhile polls show Hillary Clinton retains a commanding lead over her Democratic presidential rivals, her attempts to focus her campaign on issues like education and economic recovery have been complicated by constant questions surrounding her decision to run her State Department email correspondence through an unsecured system set up at her suburban New York home.\nAt a Democratic fundraising event in the state of Iowa, which kicks of next year’s nominating contests, Hillary Clinton said she would ”do my part to provide transparency to Americans – that’s why I’m insisting 55,000 pages of my emails be published as soon as possible” and turned over the server.\n”I won’t pretend that this is anything other than what it is: the same old partisan games we’ve seen so many times before,” she said.\nHillary Clinton also offered a light take on the email probe when she talked about launching a Snapchat social media account. ”I love it,” she said. ”Those messages disappear all by themselves.”\nOne of the now ”top secret” emails included a discussion of a U.S. drone strike, part of a covert program that is widely known and discussed. A second conversation could have improperly referred to highly classified material, but it also could have reflected information collected independently, U.S. officials who have reviewed the correspondence told The Associated Press.\nOn Monday, the inspector general for the 17 spy agencies that make up what is known as the intelligence community told Congress that two of 40 emails, in a random sample of 30,000 messages that Hillary Clinton gave the State Department for review, contained information deemed ”Top Secret,” one of the government’s highest levels of classification.\nWhile neither of the emails was marked classified at the time they were sent, they have since been slapped with a ”TK” marking, for ”Talent Keyhole,” suggesting material obtained by spy satellites. And they also were marked ”NOFORN,” meaning information that can only be shared with Americans with security clearances.\nThe two emails got those markings after consultations with the CIA and other agencies where the material originated, officials said. Some officials said they believed the designations were a stretch – a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification.\nThe officials who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity work in intelligence and other agencies. They wouldn’t detail the full contents of the emails because of ongoing questions about classification level.\nIn a four-page fact sheet that accompanied a letter to Clinton supporters, Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri stressed that Clinton was permitted to use her own email account as a government employee and that the same process concerning classification reviews would still be taking place had she used the standard ”state.gov” email account used by most department employees. The State Department, meanwhile, stressed that it wasn’t clear if the material at issue ought to be considered classified at all.\nBut even if the emails highlighted by the intelligence community prove innocuous, Clinton will still face questions about whether she set up the private server with the aim of avoiding scrutiny, whether emails she deleted because she said they were personal were actually work-related, and whether she appropriately shielded such emails from possible foreign spies and hackers.\nThe State Department advised employees not to use personal email accounts for work, but it wasn’t prohibited.\n 15, 2015 4:19 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:11:11.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
