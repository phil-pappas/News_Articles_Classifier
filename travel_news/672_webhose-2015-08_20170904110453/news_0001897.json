Football doesn’t wait for you.”\nHidalgo said he has not yet decided on an interim head coach, but mentioned that he would talk to new assistant coach Oscar Ramírez to possibly gauge his interest in the position.\nOriginal post starts below\nPaulo Wanchope has stepped down as the head coach of the Costa Rica men’s football team, according to the Costa Rican Football Federation (FEDEFUTBOL).\nLate Tuesday night Wanchope was involved in a fight at a pre-Olympic game of Costa Rica’s under-23 team in Panama. Video of the fight showed Wanchope hitting a security guard after he was reportedly denied access to the field.\n“ @MiDiarioPanama : [Noticia del momento] La pelea que protagonizó Wanchope en Panamá. http://t.co/rvmb1cBXG9 pic.twitter.com/MnfD6jPls2 ”\n— La Portada (@LaPortadaSPORT) August 12, 2015\nWanchope’s short career ends with an official 0-4-5 record, though he did lead “La Sele” to a win in the Central America Cup as interim coach.\nWe will update this story as more information becomes available.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/rvmb1cBXG9", "https://twitter.com/LaPortadaSPORT/status/631334308704157696", "http://t.co/MnfD6jPls2", "https://twitter.com/MiDiarioPanama"], "published": "2015-08-13T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:13:52.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
