The question is not whether it will, but how, as the turmoil reshapes the way Chinese travel internationally. Analysts said the slowdown will hit some places and sectors harder than others.\nIn the first half of this year, the Chinese made 61.9 million outbound trips, a growth rate of 13 percent over the previous year. In 2014, Chinese tourists shelled out $164.8 billion overseas. The top 10 destinations for affluent Chinese in 2014 were Japan, the U.S., Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand, the Maldives, Australia, Italy, Switzerland and Greece.\nOverall, Chinese contribute the most of any nationality to tourism worldwide, and it is middle-class Chinese who are often seen as driving the increase in travel. With the market downturn, however, once lavish spending might diminish.\nWhat that impact could look like depends on several factors. If members of China’s middle class did not invest heavily in the stock market, opting instead to keep their assets in real estate, as cash, or elsewhere, their finances may suffer less than others’ in the recent downturn. As of Wednesday, the value of Chinese stocks had plummeted by 43 percent since June, and the country’s economic growth has been sluggish.\nA 2013 report published by the consulting firm McKinsey found that in 2012, China’s upper-middle class, defined as having annual incomes ranging from 106,000 to 229,000 yuan (roughly $16,500 to $35,700), constituted a mere 14 percent of urban households. By 2022, the report predicted, China’s upper-middle class would occupy 54 percent of urban households.\nFor tourism sectors around the world, this means a growing segment of the Chinese population can fund their increasingly global interests and tastes. The government has also made it easier for Chinese to explore internationally, by easing foreign travel restrictions in 2002. Recently, Asian destinations like Hong Kong and Macau seem to have lost their appeal, with growth in those trips either diminished or with the number of overall trips declining.\nTravelling internationally also appeals because of the bragging rights accrued after people visit exotic destinations. “It’ll enrich them more personally,” Jacopo Sertoli, president of Welcome Chinese, a Shanghai hospitality firm, said. “They can say to their peers, ‘I have been to Europe, the Middle East, United States.’”\nWhether Chinese travellers will opt for destinations closer to home or simply travel to Europe on tighter budgets amid the slowdown remains to be seen.\nOr, they might curb spending in other ways. “I don’t think you will see fewer Chinese tourists on getting airplanes overall. Just fewer at the Louvre and in the Seoul airport duty-free shops,” Towson said.\nThey could also opt to forgo Europe entirely. An increasingly popular destination for China’s expanding and increasingly curious middle class is the Middle East.\nIn 2015, hotels in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, recorded a 74 percent rise in Chinese guests. The 241,000 Chinese guests who visited Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during the first half of 2015 represented a 25 percent increase over the previous year.\nRegardless of the recent downturn, 1.2 billion Chinese remain an untapped market.\nBy one estimate, just 3 percent carry passports which represents a growth potential that in the long run can hardly be hampered by financial upheavals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:28:18.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
