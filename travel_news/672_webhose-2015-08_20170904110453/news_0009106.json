The magnifique events are timed to take place over the traditional wine harvest period in France.\nSoiree Bar will provide guests and Sydneysiders a taste sensation to write home about with wine and cheese pairings and insights into the aromatics and flavours of wine – with their very own sommelier. For just $35 per person, guests will receive two hand selected wines carefully matched with a unique selection of characteristic cheeses – blue, soft ripen, hard and wash rind.\nFor a finite end to the week, French wine Friday’s will be the order of the day in Soiree Bar during October. Starting the weekend with a splash, on top of an array of refreshing champagne cocktails such as a black raspberry royale, bellinis and mimosas, an exclusive pop-up wine bar serving Veuve Clicquot and Moet by Moet Hennessey will keep guests hydrated.\nTo top off the wine days, and exclusive event will take place on 15 October for inhouse guests residing in a Luxury Club suite. French wine expert Dourthe will host a private Le Club Millesime wine tasting. With guests having the opportunity to discuss grape varietals, vinification and the science of wine with tastings of a selection of wines from France and across the world.\nAs wine becomes increasingly global in terms of consumption, appreciation and production, it also remains inherently linked to the French culture and gastronomy, intrinsic to the Sofitel brand.\nSource:- Accor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T07:58:00.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
