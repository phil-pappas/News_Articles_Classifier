The event, which sees Mr. Smith coming face-to-face with his wax figure, comes hot on the heels of his knockout performance at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival. \nMr. Smith’s powerful voice has captured audiences worldwide. The release of his debut album in 2014, In the Lonely Hour, led by the soul-inflected single Stay with Me earned him a No. 2 on the US Billboard Top 200, and garnered him four Grammy Awards in 2015, including Best New Artist, and Best Pop Album. He can now add being immortalized in wax by Madame Tussauds to his glittering accolades. \nSam Smith worked closely with the Madame Tussauds artists who spent hours sitting with the star taking over 250 measurements, identifying exact eye color, and detailing each strand of hair. Sam generously donated the suit and shoes to his wax likeness. \n“I can't actually believe that I'm going to be in Madame Tussauds,” said Smith of the reveal. “This is the ultimate 'pinch yourself' moment. The process was so fascinating and I will never look at a waxwork in the same way again. \n“Thank you Madame Tussauds, and hope you all have fun. Feel free to squeeze my wax bum!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:47:42.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
