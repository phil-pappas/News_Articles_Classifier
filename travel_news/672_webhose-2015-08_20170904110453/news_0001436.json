Over the past few years, we have seen tablet computers evolve from toys for geeks and execs into affordable everyday computers.\nNow, they’re increasingly forming part of the educational landscape. They’re cost-effective (especially entry-level Android-based models), offer decent battery life, and are functional and flexible enough to help learners get their work done. Here are some of the key benefits tablets offer in the classroom:\n1. Simpler IT support\nThe beauty of tablet computers lies in their simplicity. They are easy to use because of their intuitive touchscreen interfaces and pose a lower barrier of entry for students who are not yet familiar with computers.\nBecause they have fewer components than a traditional PC, they tend to be more reliable from a hardware perspective.\nProvided their owners don’t \"jailbreak\" them to install pirated apps and other unauthorised software, tablet computers are more resistant to malware.\nAnd since their operating systems are simpler and less customisable, there are fewer ways for a learner to accidentally make a configuration change that renders the device unusable. This all translates into lower overheads for IT support.\n2. Mobile lifestyle\nToday’s schoolchildren and youth are a mobile generation. Even kids from poorer homes are usually familiar with cell phones and feature phones. Tablets are a perfect fit for their lifestyle since they are personal, light, portable, and offer good battery life on a single charge.\nLearners don’t need access to a computer lab to do their work because they always have their tablet computers with them. If a child is sick at home, for example, he or she may still be able to do some of the day’s work on the tablet. As long as they have an internet connection, children can keep learning.\n3. There’s an app for that\nThere are millions of apps available for the most popular tablet operating systems, including a rich selection of educational apps. From maths to physics and from English to biology, schoolchildren have a wide range of content at their fingertips.\n4. Personalised and interactive learning\nTablets offer schoolchildren a range of learning tools in one place and help them to engage deeply with educational content. They can record the classroom session for later review, use calculators and other tools, and do so on one interface. They may no longer need to, for example, buy a separate scientific calculator, take a separate camera on field trips, or carry a lot of textbooks around.\nTablets can also make educational content come to life with video, audio and gamification. Rather than simply seeing a picture of Nelson Mandela in a textbook, they can view video footage of the day he was released from prison. If they’re reading a book, they can look up a word they don’t know from a dictionary integrated into the e-reader app — all of which result in a richer learning experience.\n• Ernst Wittmann is country manager for Southern Africa at Alcatel One Touch\n© Motorburn.com", "external_links": ["http://memeburn.com/"], "published": "2015-08-03T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:09:49.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
