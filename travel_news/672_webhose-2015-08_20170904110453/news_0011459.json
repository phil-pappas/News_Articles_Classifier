Major ivory seizures between 2013 and 2015 are estimated at 50 tons, a record that indicates danger facing the African jumbos. \nRhino populations are even more at risk, with most killed in South Africa and which boasts of breeding a population of about 25,000 rhinos in highly-protected parks. \nA recent report released by the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) showed that Tanzania lost 60 percent of its elephants in the past five years. The country had as low as 43,330 jumbos in 2014 from 109,051 in 2009. \nAccording to AWF, a single elephant can generate US$1.6 million in tourism revenue if left to live out its normal lifespan. \nIt is estimated that 65,721 elephants were killed in Tanzania during the past five years, making this African elephant state being dubbed as “Elephant slaughterhouse.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:25:05.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
