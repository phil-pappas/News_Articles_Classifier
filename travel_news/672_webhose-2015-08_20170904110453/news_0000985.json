JIM BYERS PHOTO Article Outdoors \nCanada is known for having dozens of fantastic golf courses. I love Whistler and the Banff Springs courses, not to mention Highlands Links in Nova Scotia and Rocky Crest in Muskoka. But I also like some smaller, out-of-the-way courses. With that in mind, here’s one casual golfer’s look at a variety of courses across Canada; places that everyone from beginners to accomplished pros will appreciate. \nWATERTON LAKES , ALBERTA – Jasper and Banff, not to mention Canmore, get a fair bit of ink in Alberta golf stories. But I loved Waterton Lakes when I played there last summer. It’s not the best-kept course on the planet, but the setting is fantastic with wide skies and towering mountains all around. It’s also fairly cheap ($59 for 18 holes on weekends) and super-casual. When I stopped in last year I was told the only rules about clothing were no muscle shirts and “no visible butt cracks.” You gotta love a course like that. \nKIRRIE GLEN , BRACEBRIDGE, ONTARIO – There are fancier courses in the Muskoka region north of Toronto. But few offer the value of Kirrie Glen, a lovingly kept nine-hole affair with nice elevation changes and beautiful landscaping. Folks with cottages on Lake Muskoka can dock their boat across the street from the clubhouse and traipse across the highway with their clubs. When I was there a couple weeks ago they were advertising a golf and dinner package for $55. Tough to beat that kind of value in this part of Ontario. \nHUMBER VALLEY , NEWFOUNDLAND & LABRADOR – The surrounding real estate development has had some difficulties, which unfortunately overshadows a truly fabulous golf course. The elevation changes are spectacular and the routing is top-notch. It’s one of my favourite designs of Canadian golf architect Doug Carrick. Not only that, 18 holes is only $80 plus tax. \nSTANLEY PARK PITCH AND PUTT , VANCOUVER – Okay, you tee up your ball on a plastic mat. And the longest hole is around 100 yards. But this is one seriously beautiful walk in the park, with glorious, ancient redwoods rising into the British Columbia sky and acres of deep green grass and lovely planters with pinky-red begonias and flowing sweet potato vine. Go early in the morning for great light and fewer crowds. Top rate is about $13. \nDAKOTA DUNES , SASKATCHEWAN - This beauty was voted one of North America’s best new courses when it opened some 10 years ago. It feels like a links course in the middle of the prairies, with natural, gnarly grasses all around and large waste bunkers in a surprisingly hilly part of the province. There’s a lovely variety of hole shapes and it’s a veritable beast from the tip at 7,301 yards, often with prairie winds that have been known to blow over sponsors’ tents during corporate events. \nCABOT LINKS AND CABOT CLIFFS , NOVA SCOTIA - Cabot Links set the standard a few years ago, opening as Canada’s first true links course in the village of Inverness. It’s a smack-dab gorgeous layout that runs along the Gulf of St. Lawrence, with pot bunkers and rolling hills and nasty rough and fairways that let you run the ball for miles. They just opened the new, 18-hole Cabot Cliffs course this summer. It’s even more striking than its older sibling, with a trio of finishing holes that might be the most beautiful in North America. \nHONOURABLE MENTIONS \nFAIRMONT LE RICHELIEU , QUEBEC - A commanding presence high above the St. Lawrence River east of Quebec City, with lovely holes and great food when I was there. \nJUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ON PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND - I haven’t played here enough to talk in detail about the courses, but I’ve walked part of the Green Gables Course and Crowbush Cove, both of which look marvellous. \nTOBIANO , BRITISH COLUMBIA - This is another relatively new course, a Tom McBroom design outside of Kamloops. The surroundings are stark and almost desert like, with tall, rocky hills and a long, thin lake running on one side. The course dipsy doodles up and down hills and around small ravines. \nCANMORE , ALBERTA - Stewart Creek is a fine course in the area, as is Silvertip. Both offer exceptional views of the steep-sided valley south of Banff. Good value, too. \nFLEMINGDON PARK GOLF CLUB , TORONTO - This is a fun, family-run nine-hole course just off the busy Don Valley Parkway in midtown Toronto. A great little patio for lunch or a beer. \nDEAL OF THE WEEK \nThe newly renovated Chelsea Hotel in downtown Toronto has a back-to-school deal (sorry, kids), with accommodation in a Chelsea guestroom, underground hotel parking and a $20 Old Navy gift card for $195 per room per night. The deal is available from Aug. 13 to Sept. 7, 2015. Kids 17 and under stay free in a parents’ room, while kids 6 and under eat for free and children 7-12 eat for half-price. There’s free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel and a terrific indoor pool with a waterslide. You’re just a couple short blocks from the Eaton Centre and they’ll run you down to the Rogers Centre for a Blue Jays game for $5. \nDESTINATION OF THE WEEK \nBoston’s food scene has come a long way from white fish and a sprig of overcooked broccoli. You’ll find marvellous restaurants all over town, including Puritan and Co. near Harvard University and Tavern Road in the hip Fort Point area near downtown. Don’t miss the breakfast hash at Charlie’s Sandwich Shoppe, where President Obama once stopped for a cheeseburger. For something different, try a tour of the city’s harbour and check out the 300-year-old lighthouse at Brewster Island.
