Boulder has the fourth-lowest rate of auto commuting of all U.S. metro areas. That's according to the U.S. Census Bureau's report \"Who Drives to Work? Commuting by Automobile in the United States, 2013\" released today. According to the report, 71.9 percent of Boulder residents commute travel by private vehicle, with the other 28.1 percent either working at home or using some alternative mode of transportation. The report says 11.1 percent of Boulder workers don't commute at all, but rather work at home. Nationally, the report found that although the automobile is still king when it comes to commuting, the rate at which people drive to work has stabilized since the 1980s, where it was on a steady upward climb. The number of people in the U.S. who drove alone to work in 2013 was 76.4 percent. Carpooling, at 9.4 percent, was the next most common form of transportation, followed by public transportation at 5.2 percent; working at home at 4.4 percent; walking at 2.8 percent; bicycling at 0.6 percent; and other at 1.3 percent. In addition, the report found that people who live in a central city — which is more likely to have mass transit available — are more likely to use an alternate form of transportation, although Denver did not rank as one of the top 10 cities where that is the most common. The report ( download here ) is based on data from the American Commuters' Survey, which is conducted annually by the Census Bureau to gather information about changes in the socioeconomic, housing and demographic characteristics of communities across the U.S. \nWant Denver Technology   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:07:11.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
