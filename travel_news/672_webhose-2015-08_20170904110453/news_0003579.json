The Finance Ministry collected public comments and suggestions on the proposals before submitting the reform bills this week.\nValue added tax\nThe first proposal seeks to swap the current sales tax for a value added tax, meaning most products and services would be taxed. However, under the proposal, funds collected from the VAT on certain basic services and goods, like food, would be returned to lower-income taxpayers using an electronic system.\nThese taxpayers would also get a refund for taxes paid on monthly rent that’s lower than ₡403,400 ($747), private education and health services, as long as they are paid using credit or debit cards.\nFallas said some 40 percent of the population would receive a yearly tax refund under the proposal.\nIn addition, tax exemptions would apply to electricity bills for families whose consumption is lower than 250 kilowatts per month, and to water bills when monthly consumption is lower than 30 cubic meters.\nExtending the number of taxed goods and services mostly aims at improving controls on tax dodgers, Fallas said.\nThe VAT tax would increase annually under the proposal, from 13 percent — the same as the current sales tax — to 15 percent in two years.\nIncome tax\nProposed changes to income taxes include two new salary brackets. Monthly income above ₡2,225,000 million ($4,120) and up to ₡4,450,000 ($8,240) would be taxed at 20 percent. All monthly income above ₡4,450,000 would be taxed at 25 percent.\nThe Finance Ministry estimates these new segments account for some 3 percent of the country’s workers.\nCurrently, monthly income above ₡793,000 ($1,469) and up to ₡1,190,000 ($2,200) is taxed at 10 percent, while all income above ₡1,190,000 is taxed at 15 percent. Monthly income under ₡793,000 ($1,469) would remain tax-exempt.\nNew taxes, old promises\nThe proposal also intends to tax at 15 percent all remittances sent abroad as well as profits derived from selling properties, as well as used vehicles, boats and planes.\nCorporations owning sports teams that generate profits — currently exempt — also would be taxed as well as large cooperatives Both would be taxed at 8 percent.\nThe draft bill also introduces control measures aimed at reducing evasion, avoidance and loopholes according to standards developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ).\nThe fiscal period under the new proposed plan would run exactly as a natural year (Jan. 1-Dec. 31), replacing the current period which runs from Oct. 1-Sept. 30. Tax returns and payments should be made by mid-March and partial payments can be made in June, September and December.\nPresident Luis Guillermo Solís stressed during his campaign the need for a fiscal reform . But he said he was against new taxes, instead favoring improved collection of existing taxes.\nStill, new taxes are definitely part of the government’s current proposal.\nA new “green” or environmental tax would be added to non-returnable plastic bottles — ₡10 per every 250 milliliter or its equivalent. That means a one-liter bottle would carry a ₡40 tax.\nSolís said at a public event Wednesday that he’s aware that the reforms would affect mostly middle- and upper-class taxpayers, but he said the effects would be minimal.\nReactions\nFinance Minister Fallas said the tax reform is necessary to lessen the fiscal deficit that is threatening the country’s historic social achievements. He also said Costa Rica was “the only country in the region that has not done any tax reform in the last five years.”\nEntrepreneurs reacted negatively to the government’s proposal.\n“This is not a good time to talk about taxes,” José Manuel Hernando, president of the Costa Rican Food Industry Chamber ( CACIA ), said.\nHe mostly noted that taxing goods and services that currently are exempt would be a blow to consumers.\n“The government’s proposal really alarms and concerns our sector, which was been severely affected by the country’s economic situation, a total stagnation that has lasted for several months,” he said. Business leaders also fear the proposed reform would have a negative effect on job creation.\nRather than raise taxes, Hernando said business leaders are asking the government to reform its spending.\nRonald Jiménez, president of the Costa Rican Union of Private-Sector Chambers and Associations ( UCCAEP ), said there’s confusion about fiscal issues among the country’s leaders. He said government officials talk about taxes as the only way to fix the country’s fiscal problems.\n“The fiscal reform discussion should be comprehensive and it must incorporate talks about cutting public spending,” he said Monday.\nHurdles to the government’s plan also could come from the Legislative Assembly as opposition parties have already started to show their rejection of the proposed bills.\nJuan Jiménez Succar, leader of the National Liberation Party, said the party would not approve any new taxes as long as the government didn’t cut spending.\nLibertarian Otto Guevara concurred, saying “it is necessary to first advance on proposals to curb the government’s current squandering.”\nIn order to enter into force, both bills must be discussed and approved by the full Legislative Assembly at two separate rounds of voting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:07:43.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
