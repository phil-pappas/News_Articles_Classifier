This Palm Beach resort, which opened its doors for the first time in 2007, now has a luxurious, elegant and modern style combined with new services and facilities, featuring an infinity pool overlooking the crystalline waters of the Caribbean. \nAll of the interiors of the newly renovated Riu Palace Aruba are decorated in the modern style the RIU Hotels chain is introducing in all its new projects. A concept based on clean, contemporary lines, where fresh, vibrant colours play a leading role. Likewise, its 450 rooms also have a new modern and comfortable image paired with the latest technology, such as flat-screen satellite TV, an electronic safe, and free WiFi. \nThe restaurants and bars of the Riu Palace Aruba have also undergone a complete transformation. For example, in the Don Nicol√°s buffet restaurant, which offers international cuisine, lime green takes centre stage; while the walls of the Nautilus restaurant, located next to the pool area, simulate the sea floor with beautiful images of multi-coloured fish. \nWhen it comes to the leisure and entertainment areas, during the day guests can enjoy the recently inaugurated infinity pool and the new sun terrace, where they can relax and enjoy the laid back ambiance. At night, they can listen to live music in the refurbished theatre while having a drink in Barry's lounge or in the new cocktail area of the 24-hour sports bar. \nThe renovation of the Riu Palace Aruba updates RIU's hotel offering in Aruba along with the luxurious Riu Palace Antillas, the first hotel on the island exclusively reserved for adults 18 and older which offers all-inclusive service 24 hours a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:39:55.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
