But Siras immediately fought back, and a New York Supreme Court Justice dismissed the dissolution petition in its entirety.\nKuafu then responded by taking the drastic step of acquiring the project's loan, claiming it was protecting the project from loan-to-own lenders, only to file a second lawsuit seeking to foreclose on that same loan. But again Siras did not back down, filing claims of its own against Kuafu, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, among others, arising out of Kuafu's efforts to seize complete control of the project.\n\"This was an old-fashioned squeeze-out play,\" Ashwin Verma , Managing Partner of Siras, said of Kuafu's unprecedented conduct. \"But Siras discovered this opportunity, and we will remain its lead developers. We are now pleased,\" Verma added, \"that Kuafu has agreed to try and resolve this dispute amicably through mediation.\"\nHudson Rise continues as planned and will be a welcome addition in the changing Hudson Yards neighborhood. According to Mr. Verma, \"we are thrilled to remain at the helm of this exciting and unprecedented project.\"\nAbout Siras Development:\nSiras Development is a New York -based integrated real estate group building commercial, hospitality and residential developments of exceptional quality, led by partners Saif Sumaida and Ashwin Verma .
