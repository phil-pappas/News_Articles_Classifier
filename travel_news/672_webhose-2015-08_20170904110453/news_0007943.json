Reaching great on-time performance has been made possible through the precise and coordinated work of the UTair Operations Unit and the Flight, Technical and Commerce Departments. UTair experts interact with airports and service providers engaged in air passenger transport operations on a daily basis to improve cooperation, timely prevention of potential bottlenecks and emergencies and to better forecast hazardous situations. Any instance of deviation is thoroughly examined and analyzed. UTair maintains full compliance with aviation industry quality standards, reflected in favorable UTair punctuality ratings.\nIn June this year, only 47 UTair flights were delayed, a mere 0.72% of a total of 6,518 flights for the period.\nUTair’s punctuality has been many times recognized both by the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency monthly ratings and by Russia’s largest airports. In 2010 UTair was named the most punctual airline at Moscow Domodedovo International Airport, in 2012 – at Pulkovo International Airport in Saint-Petersburg, and in 2013 UTair was named the leading airline for punctuality at Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T03:25:13.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
