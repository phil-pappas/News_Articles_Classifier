Back home, desi beauty Sonam Kapoor combines her jacket with a crop top and a midi. \nWhile body-con dresses and fitted tops will always matter to the fashion folk, of late, loose silhouettes seem to be the trend. From oversized blazers to shirts that are two sizes too big, an increasing number of those clued into the fashion scene are ditching their body-hugging garments for breezy ensembles. \nFor designer Swapnil Shinde, this look might have become fashionably acceptable now, but it has been around for a while. “The trend of oversized clothes started with girls wearing boyfriend blazers and shirts. Since these outfits tend to be bigger in size, they are more comfortable, and make for a more hassle-free way of dressing,” he says, adding that while fitted clothes are very much still in vogue, and perhaps, will always be, the trend of “oversized dressing” is here to stay, because it “works for all sizes and shapes, and can prove to be versatile”. \nCeleb spotting Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor was recently seen wearing an anti-fit blazer with a midi and a crop top. American model and TV personality Gigi Hadid is also a major proponent of this trend, and often steps out in oversized shirts and jackets. “Looking good is no more about body-hugging clothes. Casual can be sexy too, whether it’s an oversized pair of jeans or a T-shirt,” says designer Ridhi Mehra, who feels that this trend is the result of a “trickle-up effect”, where street style has inspired high-end fashion. Miroslava Duma (inset) sports a rolled-up boyfriend jeans and shirt. \nRules of the game Experts say most important aspect to keep in mind is layering. “Always layer your separates. Whether it is an over-shirt, a cover-up boyfriend blazer or a pea coat — everything must be layered,” says Shinde, adding, “The best way to make an oversized clothing item stand out is to make it the key element, and add supplementary items as fillers. Covering yourself head to toe in baggy clothes with no proportion can make one look like a paper bag.” Wearing oversized garments in bold colours can make the look too casual, and can result in shabby dressing. Mehra suggests accessorising. “Team it with the right kinds of trousers or jeans, along with smart accessories to strike a balance between casual and smart,” she says.
