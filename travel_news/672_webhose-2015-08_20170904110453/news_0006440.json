The 36-foot boat, named Circle Hook, was headed out on a fishing charter. But the captain stopped the boat mid-ocean at the tourists’ request, according to OIJ.\nHowever, the captain kept the engine running per protocol, OIJ’s press office said.\nSome of the tourists reportedly asked if they could swim and jumped in the water, including Ah. Shortly afterwards, the captain heard a loud noise and cut the engines.\nOIJ said it appeared that Ah’s bathing suit got caught in the boat’s propeller. He died at the scene.\nPolice are still investigating the incident, as is the Public Works and Transport Ministry, which oversees watercraft.\nA spokesman for the ministry, Juan Carlos González, said the boat was fully permitted.\nThe incident was one of two boating accidents that claimed lives last week in Costa Rica. In the other, a Nicaraguan woman was killed Saturday night after the water taxi she was traveling in collided with a tourist boat in the canals of Tortuguero, on the Caribbean coast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:33:27.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
