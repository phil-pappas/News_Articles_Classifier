(AP File Photo)\nIt’s no secret that airlines have been shrinking seats to squeeze more passengers into the main cabin.\nBut after numerous complaints about its economy class chairs, British Airways announced it will be adding one-half an inch to the width of seats installed on new Dreamliner aircraft, making them 17.3 inches across.\nPrevious posts of SeatGuru and social media have called out the airline for its less-than-stellar, cramped economy seating arrangements.\nOMG @British_Airways your economy seats are ridiculous! On long haul flights this amount of legroom should not happen pic.twitter.com/NW2oHx9dBB\n— Jamie McLuckie (@jamietmcluckie) May 26, 2014\nI'm sorry @British_Airways but I don't expect to spend the next 6 hours sitting in a seat that feels like it's going to disfigure my spine\n— Matt Richards (@mattyjrichards) August 17, 2015\n“We've listened to our customers and are reacting to their feedback so in World Traveller [the airline’s economy class moniker] on the 787-9 we are increasing the width of seats, which will go up to 17.3 inches, in response to customer feedback,” a representative for the airline told the Daily Mail.\nIn addition to a wider seat, the airline will also be adding an extra inch of leg room for passengers. Current British Airways seats measure just 16.8 inches across, one of the smallest in the industry, according to Seat Guru. By comparison, Delta’s seat width on its Boeing 777 plane measures 18.5 inches across. On United 787-8 aircraft, economy seats are already 17.3 inches wide.\nBritish Airways also says it plans to upgrade the seat width on existing 787-8 aircraft in the future. The airline is will receive 22 new 787-9 planes by 2018, with the first scheduled to be delivered next month.\nBut the airline isn't the only carrier to widen instead of shrink seat sizes.\nIn April, Southwest announced it too was adding one-half an inch in the coach cabin of its Boeing 737 aircraft in the U.S., which will measure 17.8 inches across.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jamietmcluckie/status/470878279092961280", "https://twitter.com/British_Airways", "http://t.co/NW2oHx9dBB", "https://twitter.com/mattyjrichards/status/633303171562110977", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3212662/Could-economy-class-finally-getting-comfortable-BA-plans-increase-seat-sizes-passengers-wriggle-room-s-half-inch.html", "http://www.seatguru.com/charts/longhaul_economy.php"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:18:51.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
