Still, it deserves props for topicality and execution. And you root for it to be revised into a home run.\nIn its Cornish Playhouse debut, “John Baxter” very amusingly conjures the competitive, colorful world of amateur athletics before riffing on a controversial true incident at the 2008 gay softball championship in Seattle.\nTheater review ‘John Baxter Is a Switch Hitter’ By Ana Brown and Andrew Russell. Through Sept. 27 at Cornish Playhouse, Seattle Center. Tickets start at $20. (206-315-5838 or intiman.org ).\nA local team accused its San Francisco adversary of cheating by having too many heterosexuals in its ranks. (The league rules allowed one straight guy per team.) After an intrusive grilling of the players targeted as straight, or just not gay enough, the California team was suspended. That led to a lawsuit charging the league with reverse discrimination.\n “John Baxter” pitches a similar narrative. But first it dashes off brisk, amusing snapshots of the lineup.\nLyle (Adam Standley) is a gay video-game developer and avid member of Seattle’s Fireflies team. And John Baxter (Riley Shanahan), a strapping, handsome former pro player with a female fiancé, is recruited by a San Francisco coach (Reginald A. Jackson) after one of his players is sidelined.\nFranklin (Charles Leggett), the Seattle team manager, is a crusty, likable sort who schools Lyle on the history of the gay-rights movement. He also decks out his team in sparkly T-shirts to perform a showtune at the series opening.\nOther roles are designed, rather too neatly, to represent different sexual niches and subvert common misperceptions. There’s the effeminate guy who sports a tutu but also has a first-class legal mind. There’s a butch, testy and gay African-American military vet and an androgynous New Age type with a Zen outlook.\n“John Baxter” was first conceived as a film, a medium that can move with greater fluidly between multiple locales and perspectives. The play aims for complexity but it’s harder to track so many characters in short, punchy stage scenes, or to follow bits of digressive fantasy that are here more confusing than enhancing.\nDirector Rosa Joshi is a whiz at keeping everything in motion, not a simple task with a cast of 18 and several subplots. But when the pacing gets frenetic it’s the exemplary acting, spot-on comedy and verve that carry the day.\nBut then the mood gets more serious and polemical. Suspicious after watching John Baxter belt one into the bleachers, Lyle cries foul. He accuses the San Franciscans of using a straight “ringer” or two. An angry back-and-forth ensues, and a creepy mock-trial that allows no room for sexual ambiguity.\nMinor points and varying notions of gay identity are strenuously argued. And even if it’s based on a real 2008 incident, the rhetorical yes-but/no-but sparring contrasts starkly with the blithe, humorous scenes before it.\nThe matter of inclusion and exclusion, vis a vis a long persecuted minority that formed its own society after being spurned by society-at-large, is well worth raising.\nBut it gets muddled in boilerplate psychology, and the side-story of whether Lyle’s relationship with his two male nephews will be impacted by their liberal but leery father (Bradford Farwell).\nAfter talk of gays and straights being more accepting of one another, “John Baxter” tries to tie up every loose thread, which means turning the tables on the underdeveloped John Baxter character, on the eve of his wedding.\nThat curveball is not very believable, and it leads to the abrupt ending of a play that is a worthy effort, but not yet a win.\nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:27:36.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
