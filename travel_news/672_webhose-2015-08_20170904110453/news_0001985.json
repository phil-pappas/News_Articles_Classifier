All three runways at Changi will be operating by early 2020s, according to airport plans.\nChangi has been named World's Best Airport by Skytrax for three years in a row.\nMultiple improvement projects are planned for the next decade.\nIn addition to the five-story, 10-million-square-feet Terminal 5 (scheduled to open in about 2025), Terminal 1's second round of upgrades will be completed in 2018.\nA new Terminal 4 will be completed in 2017.\nA groundbreaking airport entertainment complex called Jewel Changi -- with a 40-meter-tall waterfall and a 13,000-square-meter park -- will open its doors in 2018.\nFOLLOW CNN Travel Follow @cnntravel MORE: The most awesome airport on earth is about to get more awesome", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-full-169.jpg", "http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/one-runway-may-close-for-work-in-2019", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-super-169.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/cnntravel&send=false&layout=button_count&amp;width=450&show_faces=false&action=like&colorscheme=light&font=arial&height=21", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150616174139-changi-jewel-vortex-large-169.jpg", "https://twitter.com/cnntravel", "http://www.changiairportgroup.com/cag/html/the-group/air_traffic_statistics.html"], "published": "2015-08-05T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:43:51.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
