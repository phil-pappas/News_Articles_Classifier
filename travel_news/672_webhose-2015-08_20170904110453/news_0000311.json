Attendees arriving at O’Hare International Airport were met with banners, and local restaurants fell over themselves hosting rival parties for out-of-town guests. \nSealed with the support of local businesses, this year’s deal netted almost $2 million more in sponsorship money for the Beard Foundation than it would have gotten back East. Sweeter still: Chicago gets the gala back for the next two years. \nThe city was a natural choice. As foundation President Susan Ungaro put it, “Chicago boasts over 40 Beard Award-winning chefs and restaurants, second only to New York.” \nFor the local food community, it was a chance to show the country “what we’re doing and why the city is so special,” says chef Paul Kahan. “A huge feather in our cap,” echoes chef Rick Bayless. \nAfter a week in Chicago, I’m reliving memories of prime steaks, (thin, not thick) pizza, vibrant tacos, pristine crudo, desserts painted on tarps instead of plates as if by Jackson Pollock (at the modernist Alinea) and what might be the only restaurant in the country to serve the food of Macau.

MELINA MARA/THE WASHINGTON POST \nWith a tip of the fedora to Sinatra: My kind of chow, Chicago’s is. \n*** \nNo sooner did a mud flat of 400 or so people become the city of Chicago in 1837 than posh hotels sprang up to feed a population that had developed a taste for the finer things back home in the Northeast. \nIce cream was served at the Lake House hotel, and menus from the period showcased quail with Perigord sauce and fine wines from France and Germany, says Bruce Kraig, a professor emeritus at Roosevelt University and co-author of the forthcoming “Food City: The Encyclopedia of Chicago Food.” \nWelcoming the working class was a slew of taverns where deer and prairie chickens were cooked up with readily available corn, and beer and corn liquor were the quaffs of choice. \nSome of the land purchased from the U.S. government by veterans of the War of 1812 became wheat fields, whose bounty transformed Chicago into a baking center. The city also became the country’s meat capital. By 1900, 80 percent of all American meat was processed in Chicago, says Kraig.

Food was for the most part plain, inexpensive and served in copious portions. \n“Housewives worked as hard as men,” says Kraig. “They were cooking constantly” and didn’t have time to fuss much with food. The exception to the rule, he says, gleaned from community cookbooks of the era: “The dessert, you take time on.” \n*** \nOn the surface, the Everyman dishes of Chicago sound simple. Hot dogs, Italian beef, deep-dish pizza: All can be eaten with the hands. Yet the food of the proletariat turns out to involve more instructions than Julia Child’s epic recipe for baguettes. Chicago-style hot dogs - with mustard, relish, onions, peppers, a pickle spear and more - at Portillo’s. Illustrates FOOD-CHICAGO (category d), by Tom Sietsema (c) 2015, The Washington Post.

Most purveyors buy their all-beef sausages and their poppy-seed buns from a handful of suppliers, then steam, simmer or grill the links. \nWhat makes it a Chicago dog are the many garnishes: “Dragged through the garden” refers to the yellow mustard, pickle relish, chopped white onions, chili peppers, tomato slices, pickle spear and celery salt dressing each dog. \nConspicuously absent from the mix? Let the sign at Fatso’s Last Stand in West Town make the point: “It is considered bad manners and harmful to the taste buds to put ketchup on your hot dog within the city limits of Chicago.” \nIt gets even more complicated with Italian beef, which is shorthand for a heap of shaved roast beef drenched in gravy and packed inside crusty Italian bread with sweet or hot (or both) vegetable accoutrements. As crucial to the dish is the bread, which must be substantial enough to withstand a dip or two in the meat’s cooking juices. \nThen there’s “the stance.” When eating Italian beef, fans know to place their elbows on the counter and angle themselves in a way that won’t mess up their clothes. \nWriting in “Fried Walleye and Cherry Pie,” a collection of essays by Midwestern authors, Michael Stern says, “I have come to think of (Italian beef) as the signature dish that embodies Chicago’s personality better than any other. It is brawny, intense, symphonic, and, for all its apparent disarray, audaciously composed.” \nHyperbole? When Steve Dolinsky set out this past spring to find the city’s best versions of Italian beef, the ABC-7 food reporter thought he’d do a Top 10, maybe a Top 15 list. Followers of his website weighed in with so many tips, Dolinsky, who also co-hosts “The Feed Podcast” with Bayless, ended up sampling 31 Italian beefs in two weeks. Traffic to his site spiked. \nAs for deep-dish pizza, he says, “it’s definitely our Al Capone,” meaning a tired Chicago stereotype. \n“I don’t know anybody who really eats that stuff,” says Bayless, who thinks deep-dish pies and the like are missed “mostly by people who have moved away.” He adds, “I’m more inclined to debate where the best carnitas are.” \nThe Chicago flavors I’d rush back for tend to be on the South Side, at neighborhood spots such as Uncle John’s Barbecue, where I was introduced to pork tips cooked in an “aquarium” smoker, and Vito and Nick’s, a time warp of a cash-only pizzeria beloved for its thin-crust sausage-and-cheese pizza. The base is crackery, with a buttery flavor, and is cut in a grid. \nInhaling the pie, this former Pizzeria Uno waiter switched allegiance on the spot. \n*** \nEven if Chicago hasn’t been at the inception of many restaurant trends, the city has long been “open to innovation, a refiner of ideas,” says Phil Vettel, the Chicago Tribune’s dining critic. In Alinea’s kitchen, chef-owner Grant Achatz and executive chef Mike Bagale discuss the night’s menu. Culinary trailblazers in Chicago include Achatz.

But “that was 20, 30 years ago, and that’s changed.” \nAcross the city, diners can find novel food at all price ranges, be it at Alinea — a stage set like Intro, where visiting chefs have a restaurant to call their own for a limited run — or one of multiple pan-Asian darlings. Two-year-old Fat Rice dishes out the food of Macau, a former Portuguese colony taken over by China. An explosive piri-piri chicken there goes for $29. Parachute, introduced a year ago, is a Korean-influenced American retreat where the lavish bibimbap with mackerel and preserved lemon costs $22 and is plenty for two. \nWhich brings up a point about the scene: “We’re innovative and accessible,” says Paul Kahan, whose One Off Hospitality Group includes some of the city’s top tables. (Midwesterners appreciate value with their fashions.) \nYoung entrepreneurs behind the hottest scenes are “cooking the food they want to eat,” says Bayless, who could easily apply the description to his work. Chilaquiles yucatecos at Rick Bayless’ Topolobampo in Chicago. To keep his menus fresh, he takes staffers on multiple trips to different parts of Mexico every year. MELINA MARA/THE WASHINGTON POST \nNo chef in the country does better Mexican food, at all price points, than Bayless, whose skill with the cuisine was rewarded in 1995 with an Outstanding Chef award from the Beard Foundation. \nAt the top is Topolobampo for fine dining; in the middle is the fiesta called Frontera Grill. The baby of the bunch is Xoco (“little sister” in the Aztec language), serving top-notch versions of Mexican street food. \nKahan’s stable of stars includes Blackbird, one of the first modern restaurants to jump on the farm-to-table bandwagon; Avec, a wine bar whose spare design inspired Momofuku in New York; Publican Quality Meats, a butcher shop and bakery where the display case might include mica, a funky sausage fermented in rye flour, and the sandwiches run to lamb and pork belly sausage slipped into a lobster roll; and the Violet Hour, one of the city’s pioneering craft-cocktail sources. Nico Osteria, a relative newbie in the collection, excels with Italian seafood dishes. Lunchtime at GT Fish & Oyster, where oyster po’ boys get a kick from kimchi. Chicago’s cuisine encompasses the avant-garde and the everyman. Illustrates FOOD-CHICAGO (category d), by Tom Sietsema (c) 2015, The Washington Post. Moved Wednesday, June 10, 2015. (MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo by Melina Mara) MELINA MARA/THE WASHINGTON POST \nThe osteria also demonstrates what a catch the city is for fish and seafood. A favorite pit stop for oysters — both raw and fried, then slipped into a po’boy punched up with kimchi — is the shipshape GT Fish & Oyster. \nAt heart, Kraig reminds us, “Chicago is a meat city,” even though the stockyards closed in the 1960s. Steakhouses abound. \nThe old guard is represented by places such as Gene & Georgetti, prized for the char the unseasoned steaks pick up from 1,000-degree gas broilers. \nOf the more contemporary steakhouses, Chicago Cut Steakhouse, overlooking the Chicago River, is choicest, in part for the VIP service it doles out to regular Joes but mostly for its superior shopping. The beef, all prime, is aged and butchered in-house, and even the Oreo mint pie shows flair, flavored with an intense peppermint oil. \nAnyone who has sampled the city’s smorgasbord would be hard-pressed to challenge Kokonas when he says, “Chicago has become the creative bed for experimental cuisine in America.” \nWhy? Aside from talent that can comfortably afford to live here, commercial real estate is easier to find in Chicago than in New York or San Francisco, says the restaurateur. The size of the Windy City — at 2.7 million, the country’s third most populous — means a large pool of potential diners. Further, Chicagoans are used to driving for their meals in the sprawl. \nThe Second City also loves to throw first-class parties. Hosting the Beard gala is new, but rolling out the red carpet for food-related conventions is not. Chicago has long been the site of the National Restaurant Association show, where the trade picks up ideas to serve across the country. \nIf Kyle Joseph, a tech startup veteran, gets his way, the city will also be getting Foodseum, a Chicago-focused center devoted to teaching people where food comes from and how to enjoy it. The mission: “Education, celebration, inspiration,” says the executive director of the project, who hopes to find a permanent home in the next few years. \nTo whet the public’s appetite, a three-month pop-up museum has been planned to open in mid-September. Although its location has yet to be nailed down, organizers already know what the inaugural exhibit will be: a tribute to hot dogs. \nTom Sietsema is The Washington Post’s food critic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:54:42.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
