We cannot leave it others to secure our maritime space.” \nHe called for greater cooperation between India and Seychelles in the maritime sphere, especially as the Indian Ocean is a shared space that that connects the two countries to the world and is a critical space for world trade. \n“Seychelles is committed to working closely with India in responding to security threats and ensuring the safety of our sea-lanes, the arteries of trade with the outside world. Today we have with India an exemplary partnership in the defense and security sectors. India’s determined and pro-active action in the fight against piracy and other forms of transnational crimes is highly commendable. We have, for our part, been successful in prevailing over piracy, to the extent that it no longer poses the existential threat that it did at the outset of the piracy crisis. But we have to remain vigilant. Seychelles will continue to act decisively with India against all forms of transnational crimes,” he said. \nMr. Michel said that Seychelles wishes for the ocean to remain a space for development for the benefit of the peoples of the region, and would work towards ensuring its sustainable use. \n“India is an inspiring maritime nation. We are extremely pleased to have India as a partner in the development of our Blue Economy. The signature of the agreement yesterday between India and Seychelles in the field of the Blue Economy will increase our understanding of marine ecology and resources. It will be a major boost to our scientific and economic cooperation….The Blue Economy is key to our future as an island state. It is also key to the future of the Indian Ocean region. It is key to the future of Africa and indeed key to the future of the world as a whole.” \nThe President noted that today the Blue Economy is an important component of debate and action on the international agenda, including the economic agenda of the Indian Ocean Commission and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. It is an integral component of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 as well as the Organisation’s Integrated Maritime Strategy. It is also a key element of the new United Nation’s sustainable development goals of the Post 2015 Development Agenda. \nFollowing the President’s introductory remarks, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Transport, Mr. Joel Morgan, and the Minister for Finance, Trade and the Blue Economy, Mr. Jean-Paul Adam, addressed the members of the Indian Council of World Affairs, to provide further analysis of the challenges concerning maritime security and the Blue Economy. They also participated in a Question-and-Answer Session with members of the audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:37:08.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
