The previous eruptions took place in February and May and were widely publicized around the world, leading to a stream of volcanic eruption spotters coming to Reunion Island. \nThis volcano is one of the most active in the world, and with safety measures in place, like no direct overflights are allowed by the regular helicopter tours nor are visits by car and on foot permitted to the crater rim, the eruptions can be seen from a safe distance. \nAlready on Thursday, the head of the Prefecture had given a formal eruption warning notice, putting said safety measures into place, but it took another day before the lava started flowing again. The local gendarmerie and staff from the national forestry office are patroling the area to ensure that no daring tourists crosses the safe lines while the eruptions are ongoing.
