Offering impressive Andes mountain peaks, 50 beaches on the Pacific coast, a number of historic and cultural attractions and the Amazon rainforest, mainland Ecuador is an ideal add-on to trips to the Galapagos Islands or Peru.\nLocated in the eastern region of Ecuador, the Amazon is one of the most bio-diverse places on the planet, boasting 4000 species of trees and vines, 600 species of birds and 200 species of mammals. Featuring tropical forest, picturesque rivers and waterfalls descending to the deep jungle, it is also home to many indigenous groups, and provides a memorable and exciting holiday experience.\nFor visitors to the Amazon, luxury eco-lodges and deluxe river cruises are on offer, as well as adventure sports such as white water rafting, hiking, indigenous handicraft stores and Amazonian cuisine, all of which are featured in the e-magazine. One delicious Amazonian dish featured is maito – local tambaqui fish, topped by onion, salted tomato and coriander and cloaked by banana leaves before being grilled, offering a mouth-watering taste of the jungle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:20:38.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
