Chocolate features include a restaurant with a Choco-Menu, a choco store, and three floors of chocolate themed rooms (the Milk Chocolate Floor, the Gianduja Floor and the Dark Chocolate Floor). There's also an Etruscan theme with Etruscan inspired frescoes decorating the rooms. Another hotel feature is a panoramic terrace with swimming pool (not filled with chocolate). Etruscan Chocohotel is found in Perugia, a lively walled hill town with Etruscan roots in Umbria. • Albergo Diffuso An albergo diffuso is a hotel that's spread out in a historic center of a village or town.
