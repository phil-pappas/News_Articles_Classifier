For many though, it’s not always a day that goes according to plan. One missed grade can throw up the daunting prospect of Clearing – a process that is actually seriously misunderstood . While a disappointing set of grades are understandably disheartening, Clearing needn’t be as stressful or as overwhelming as it’s made out to be. The Clearing phone call is the biggest obstacle for students to overcome in their search for a university place. But instead of panicking, it’s vital that students prepare themselves for the call if they’re to stand any chance of securing a place. Although it’s an experience that many won’t be used to, now is the time to cast aside any hesitations and take confidence in your abilities. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android With the advice of university admissions tutors, we’ve compiled a step-by-step guide to help you make that all-important phone call this Results Day and further your chances of making it through Clearing. Keep Calm and Carry On: To borrow the much exhausted maxim, ‘Keep Calm and Carry On’. Having fallen short of your expected requirements, it’s easy to start despairing. Although it’s easier said than done, students need to stay calm and focused as they prepare to make their phone calls. Nicola Murray-Fagan, head of UK student recruitment and outreach for Bournemouth University , says: “The first thing students must do is keep calm. It’s quite easy to feel pressured to make a rushed decision. They’ve got to remember they’ll be at university for three years, so they’ve got to make sure the university and course is right for them.” Debbie Milns, admissions manager at the University of Buckingham , echoes this: “Don’t panic if you have not met the original conditions of your offer/s. It may be frustrating to wait but you may be pleasantly surprised.” Research is vital: Every university will stress that research and preparation is absolutely essential to your phone call. Make sure you research the universities and courses that appeal to you in advance – this way you’ll be ready to make the Clearing phone call armed with a catalogue of useful questions and notes. Laura Kishore, head of admissions at Oxford Brookes , says: “As much preparation as possible before the phone call will help. Do the research in advance, find the course that looks interesting to you.” Nicola adds: “Students have got to think of questions before the call. Make sure to ask about everything: details about the course, the campus, course links to industry, graduate prospects.” It’s also worth looking at the available social media channels too, such as Twitter and Facebook. Nicola says: “Get information beyond the course; so look at accommodation and student support, look at social media channels, not just for university information but to get an idea of students there.” Don't get caught out during your phone call - do your research (Alamy) Photo: Alamy Plan your day: As well as doing your research, make sure to plan the day ahead. Set out which universities you’re going to ring and stick to this. Make sure to include a number of realistic objectives for yourself but don’t be afraid to be ambitious. Laura says: “There’s nothing wrong with being ambitious – many universities will often stick to the grades they’re looking for, but it’s still worth calling to have a punt. But make sure you have some realistic aims too, it can be demoralising to keep getting rejected throughout the day.” Have your relevant details to hand: Before you make the call, double check that you have all relevant information in front of you that you can draw on when talking to the university. This includes; your Ucas personal ID number, the university’s Track and Clearing code, and your exam results. Debbie recommends that it may be useful to have your GCSE results too. Ian Denning, UK recruitment communications manager at Coventry University , also advises that students have their personal statement ready. He says: “have your statement to hand to remind yourself just how good you are and why the university and admissions tutor will want to make you the offer you want.” Laura also stresses that students make sure they have the right university Clearing number when making their call. She says: “It doesn’t get off to the greatest start if you’ve rung the wrong university – it’s excusable as students will have a lot of calling to do, but it’s not a great first impression.” Time for the phone call: As for the actual calling process, students are likely to first speak to a member of a university’s Clearing helpline team before being put through to a programme administrator – but only if students impress during the first call. It’s at this point, when you’re through to a course administrator, that it’s really time to impress. Remember it’s vital to remain upbeat. “Focus on the positives,” says Nicola. “Students need to focus on what they’ve achieved in their qualifications and outside of these too.” And despite the stigma attached to Clearing, Nicola says: “You’re still worth it to someone. Even on a day when it’s not going right, a little bit of self-belief and confidence will serve you well.” But when things don’t look to be going your way, don’t give up hope. Ian says: “Don’t lose sight of the subject you really want to study. Why settle for a course that doesn’t ignite your passion?” Remember that universities are actually looking to fill their places so give them a reason to offer you one of these places. Prove to them why you are deserving of a place at their university – this is what they want to hear. Dos and Don’ts: Do have all relevant details next to you when making the phone call, including your Ucas Track number, a break down of your grades (don’t forget your GCSEs too), your personal statement, and the university’s Ucas number as well as its clearing code. Do ask lots of questions. This is the only way you’ll find out everything you want to know and will let the university know you’re an engaged and interested student. Do spend some time thinking over an offer and weigh it up against any existing ones you may already have. Do note down details of your conversation as you make each phone call. Names, email addresses, numbers, codes, etc. You’re likely to need these details again so make sure to hold on to them. Do be positive and optimistic when talking. Tears and sob stories won’t be of much use. Don’t forget that Clearing is a two-way street. The university will be making sure you’re suitable for them, but you need to see if the university is right for you too. Don't , under any circumstances, get your parents to make the call on your behalf. Don’t settle for a subject that doesn’t really appeal to you. What point is there spending three or more years studying a course that doesn’t interest you? Don’t at any point ask “What can I study with these grades?” or “What will you take me for?” Universities want to see a student who is passionate about their subject and not someone who’s happy to take what’s going. Don’t exaggerate or lie about your qualifications. Universities can withdraw offers made over the phone if they later see that you’ve inflated your results. Don’t ring the wrong university by accident – it’s an obvious one but you’d be surprised by how many students make this mistake. Don’t feel pressured to accept a place straight away if you’re offered one. But Do keep to deadlines set.
