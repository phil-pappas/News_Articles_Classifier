The event encourages fitness and entertainment for the entire family by holding USATF-sanctioned running events for all skill levels and ages in conjunction with the novel roller coaster event, Roller Coaster Ride. Participants can register for either the 10K race or the 5K run/walk, which start at 7:30 am. Online registration is available through Wednesday, September 2. Runners and riders can also register at the host hotel, La Quinta Inn in Springfield, on Saturday, September 5 from noon until 5:00 pm. There will be no race day registration. Event registration includes park admission, shirt, finisher medal, and post race refreshments. The race course, which winds around and under some of the park’s famous roller coasters, is flat and open giving runners a chance to achieve their personal best time. Also, this is the first Roller Coaster Race ever to start and end within a park’s boundaries, allowing runners to hang out in the picnic grove before and after the race, and spectators to watch the race from the park’s main avenues.\nAdditionally, roller coaster enthusiasts and runners alike can sign up for the optional Roller Coaster Ride for a separate fee. Participants who register for the Roller Coaster Ride earn a medal by racking up cumulative “5K ride distance” on Six Flag’s roller coasters. “The Roller Coaster Ride is a great opportunity for participants to experience all the fantastic coasters rides at Six Flags New England,” says Adam Slate, Roller Coaster Race Director. “The park represents everything that’s great about the American amusement park experience. It’s literally located on Main Street in the charming New England town of Agawam, Massachusetts.”\nRoller Coaster Race supports the YMCA of Greater Springfield. YMCA’s programs promote lifelong personal growth throughout 14 cities and towns in the Greater Springfield area. Roller Coaster Race also supports the SYTA Running for Youth program and the National Roller Coaster Museum & Archives as national charity partners. Participants can fundraise on behalf of a charity, or make a donation along with their registration.\n\"Six Flags New England is thrilled to be partnering with Roller Coaster Race once again. It is a great partnership between two brands as we support local charities throughout the community and promote healthy living,” said Jennifer McGrath, Six Flags New England’s Communications Manager. “Whether participants run or ride we know they will have an exceptional time at the Coaster Capital of New England.\"\nFor more information about the Roller Coaster Race @ Six Flags New England, please visit http://www.rollercoasterrace.com/springfield\nAbout Roller Coaster Race\nRoller Coaster Race is a running series that partners with theme and amusement parks across the country to create family destination events combining fitness and entertainment.
