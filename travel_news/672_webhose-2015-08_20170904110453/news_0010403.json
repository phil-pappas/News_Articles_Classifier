Name of book: \"A 1,000-Mile Great Lakes Island Adventure\" Author: Loreen Niewenhuis Publisher: Crickhollow Books of Milwaukee Where can it be purchased? \"Everywhere books are sold, but I encourage people to support their local indie bookstore and Holland has a wonderful one: Reader's World.\" Synopsis of the book: The final book in Niewenhuis's Great Lakes Adventure trilogy launches off the shoreline to the islands of the Great Lakes. From hiking the rugged wilderness of Isle Royale in Lake Superior, to strolling the metropolis on Montreal Island, Niewenhuis explores islands throughout the Great Lakes basin in this island odyssey. Why did you write the book? I have spent the past six years exploring the Great Lakes. My first adventure was exploring my favorite place by hiking all the way around Lake Michigan and then writing the book \"A 1,000-Mile Walk on the Beach.\" Then, I did another 1,000-mile hike exploring all five Great Lakes. This adventure is in my second book, \"A 1,0000-Mile Great Lakes Walk.\" To cap my exploration of the Great Lakes, I explored the islands. My final book in this trilogy is \"A 1,000-Mile Great Lakes Island Adventure.\" Other thoughts: \"I hope that my books expand people's understanding and appreciation of the Great Lakes.\" Upcoming book signings: All events can be found at her website, http://LakeTrek.com . She will also give a lecture in Lawrence, Michigan as part of Van Buren County's \"One Book One County\" read on Oct. 6 at the Lawrence Conference Center. The program will start at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T11:12:28.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
