The first five months of 2015 have displayed an encouraging 15.89% growth over 2014\nTAT Mumbai is working with travel agents to ensure that the destination achieve both qualitative and quantitative growth. Soraya Homchuen, director, TAT Mumbai shares that a quality tourism development initiative is coming soon: “We are planning the third edition of A Luxury Showcase, our roadshow with a focus on high end travel-packaging. It is slated for October 5 in Mumbai,” she says.\nThe tourism board recently concluded agent-connect events in Coimbatore and Chennai in a bid to keep numbers upbeat from newer, non-metro markets even while it pursues new markets in its traditional metro markets.\nConsumer connect initiatives by TAT Mumbai have included special deals curated in collaboration with travel agents including Sunday Pure Holidays, Mercury and Veena World; a radio and social media contest targeted at newly-weds on Red FM and a food festival linked to a social media contest in partnership with JW Marriott Mumbai Sahar.\nThe Indian market looks upbeat even as the falling Euro, plummeting Rouble and Chinese stock market appear like they might present challenges for Thailand.", "external_links": ["http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T12:20:44.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
