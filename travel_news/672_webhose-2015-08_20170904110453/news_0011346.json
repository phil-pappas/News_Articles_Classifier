And there's so much more. \n\"I'm proud of this country. We look after our guests,\" says Aine Mangan, director of the Dublin East Coast Golf Alliance, which won the IAGTO European Golf Destination of 2015 award. \n\"People say the Irish friendliness and welcome is genuine,\" says one of our hosts on a recent trip, Conor Mallaghan, the owner and CEO of Carton House, a magnificent property with a couple of golf courses a big part of the picture. \"We're a small nation, proud of our history and culture and we like showing that off to people. You'll have a good time, we can guarantee that.\" \nAh, yes, a good time. And that starts with raising a pint of Guinness, a bit of a national treasure. Any trip to Dublin would be incomplete without a few night-time hours in the Temple Bar area, a treasure chest of bars and talented street musicians. \nWe also spent an evening at Roches Pub in Kildare. It's called The Sinking Pub because, well because it's sinking, tilted on one side and that wasn't the Guinness speaking. \nOur itinerary included golf at Powerscourt, the Island Golf Club, Carton House, K Club, Druids Glen, and Mount Juliet. We spent nights at Powerscourt, Carton House, K Club, Druids Glen and Mount Juliet, all exceptional hotels for food and lodging. \nWe learned that buggies, pronounced something like boogies, are actually golf carts. And trolleys are what we call pull carts. \nThe K Club, with the Palmer Ryder Cup course and the Smurfit course, was an obvious highlight. Regularly ranked among the top three parkland courses in Ireland and host of the 2006 Ryder Cup and 11 European Opens, it lives up to its billing -- and then some. Back in 2006, the U.S. side led by Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Jim Furyk was steamrolled by the Europeans with stars like Darren Clarke, Henrik Stenson, Sergio Garcia and Colin Montgomerie. \n\"I've golfed around the world,\" says K Club pro Michael Dixon. \"If you say K Club, they say, 'Oh, the K Club -- the Ryder Cup. There has to be some mystique when you've had such greats walk and play a tournament like that. \n\"One thing I notice, when you come here and close your eyes, it seems like the birds are permanently singing. There's a charmingness and a ruggedness to the course. Maybe the word I'm looking for is authentic. It's got a rugged, natural terrain, cut into the land, rather than with bulldozers.\" \nAs recently as 1973 you got to the The Island Golf Club, a Golf Top 100 course established in 1890, by boat from Malahide across the estuary. It was our introduction to Irish links golf. Bordered by the sea on three sides, with the highest sand dunes on the East Coast, the Island Golf Club was an amazing walking experience. It's home to the nasty 14th hole, called Old Clubhouse, with the narrowest fairway I've seen and with a large lateral water hazard on the right. \nPowerscourt has several different moods, starting with parkland hemmed in by hedges, ancient oaks and beech trees. \nDruids Glen, so amazing it has been called the Augusta of Europe, is delightful in design and playability. It's a past winner of European Golf Resort of the Year and has hosted the Irish Open four times. It was also a favourite on my trip. \nCarton House, last year's winner of Irish Golf Resort of the Year, is another gem. \n\"The two courses we have (O'Meara, parkland, and Montgomerie, links) are different, but complementary,\" Mallaghan says. \"If I'm asked which is my favourite, I say it's like trying to choose between your children, it's impossible to do.\" \nCarton House has been home to Peter Sellers, Julie Andrews and Marianne Faithful. \nMount Juliet, with a Jack Nicklaus course, has hosted the 2002 American Express World Golf Championships and three Irish Open Championships. \nMORE INFORMATION \nFor more Dubline-area golf, check out dublingolfalliance.com .
