A luxury hotel development would mean more economic growth and more jobs for Territorians.\n“It’s all part of the Country Liberals Government’s plan to create jobs and opportunities, drive the development of North Australia and build a $2.2 billion visitor economy by 2020.”\nMr Giles said internationally recognised hotel chains such as the Shangri-La Hotel groups and Accor (Sofitel/Pullman) had shown interest in establishing a brand presence in Darwin, should they find the right commercial arrangement or development partnership.\n“While there are a number of new accommodation projects in the pipeline over the next few years, these developments are largely targeting the mainstream market, delivering the equivalent of four stars,” he said.\n“The EOI process would help facilitate the development of a luxury hotel, achieving standards not previously seen in Darwin.\n“A new hotel of this calibre would give Darwin a significant edge in the lucrative business conference market – which currently injects around $89 million into the economy each year.”\nThe EOI process is likely to comprise a two phase process involving an initial non-binding offer phase, followed by a short-listing process. Short listed bidders would then be invited to submit fully developed and costed final bids.\nAssuming a suitable bid is received, it is anticipated that a contract would be awarded in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:24:48.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
