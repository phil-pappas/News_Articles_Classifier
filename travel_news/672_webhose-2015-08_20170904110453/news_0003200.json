He was also ordered to complete five days of roadside cleanup, graffiti removal or other manual labor, which is the final component of his sentence.\nFILE - In this May 9, 2015 file photo, Justin Bieber arrives at Wango Tango 2015 in Carson, Calif. A Los Angeles judge said Monday, Aug. 3, 2015, that he was giving Bieber until November to complete the community labor requirements of his sentence in a misdemeanor vandalism case filed after he threw eggs at his neighborâ€™s home last year, causing roughly $80,000 in damage. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP, File) Bieber's probation report states the singer completed two days of work at a Los Angeles shelter last month and \"displayed a positive attitude with both the staff and residents.\"\nA prosecutor said Monday Bieber is close to finishing the work and requested one more court hearing to make sure the singer completes his sentence.\nBieber's progress on the work was previously delayed due to a severe ankle injury.\nThe Grammy-nominated singer did not attend Monday's hearing, and he has until July 2016 to complete the work.\nHe was sued earlier this year by his former neighbors, Jeff and Suzanne Schwartz, who accused the singer of terrorizing them while living in a gated community in Calabasas.\nTheir home suffered around $80,000 in damage as a result of Bieber's egg attack, an amount the singer has repaid. Jeff Schwartz also claims the singer terrorized his family with loud driving, unsafe driving and spit in his face during one incident.\nBieber has since moved out of the gated community.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/03/7f/ba/347058fe38ca4642a3040fbf5e7bff7a-1a15fced97bc4615bdffaee3e74512a1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-03T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T01:31:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
