Lavanya Hinduja Impact intern, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/14/2015 06:13 PM EDT \nA Filipino brother and sister have engineered a product that will provide the country's off-the-grid communities with an affordable lighting solution. \nAisa and Raphael Mijeno introduced a sustainable source of light and energy last year with their invention, SALt (Sustainable Alternative Lighting), a lamp that functions using saltwater and metal rods . \nAisa, who works in the engineering department at De La Salle University in Lipa and is also a member of Greenpeace Philippines, said she was struck by the daily challenge that the Philippine’s rural population faces in accessing kerosene for their lamps. \n“Most of these people are so poor and underprivileged that they endure long hours of walking just to get kerosene for their lamps,” Aisa told ABS-CBN news . One out of 50 households in the Philippines and over 1.5 billion people worldwide rely on kerosene lamps, according their video .

It’s a social movement.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T01:27:40.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
