The Van Gogh Europe Foundation is seizing the opportunity to honour the famous Dutch artist with a top-quality programme: fascinating exhibitions, cycle routes, art events but also digital applications, etc.\nThe activities will take place in the various locations where Van Gogh lived and worked during his life, and also in museums where his works are preserved, examined and displayed. The common theme that has been chosen is ‘125 years of inspiration’. The idea behind this is that the artist continues to inspire many people even today: no wonder that many surveys show that Van Gogh is one of the most popular artists ever.\nChairman Frank van den Eijnden: “Vincent van Gogh is an international icon who appeals to hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. We want to use 2015 to provide a rich programme for everyone who shares the passion of Van Gogh’s life and work, and which does justice to the artist.” The Van Gogh Europe Foundation (‘Stichting Van Gogh Europe’) was established in January 2013 by the Van Gogh Museum, the Kröller-Müller Museum and Van Gogh Brabant with the aim of making Van Gogh’s heritage jointly accessible to everyone.\nThese organisations together with Mons 2015, form a collaboration under the name Van Gogh Europe comprising around 30 institutions which are preserving Van Gogh’s heritage actively in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and England. General director of the Van Gogh Museum, Axel Rüger: “Van Gogh enthusiasts around the world are interested in his art, but also in his life. By working together with the various Van Gogh locations, we can make his life tangible. This cooperation creates a valuable extra dimension.” The Conservatorium Hotel has created a special stay with an immersive Van Gogh experience.\nThis exclusive package celebrates one of the Netherlands’ most revered artists and pays tribute to his life and 125 years since his passing. This package includes: · A two-night luxurious stay with continental breakfast (for two) · Two tickets for Van Gogh Museum, located just opposite the hotel · Two media tour tickets Van Gogh Museum · Book Van Gogh Masterpiece (in your preferred language) (Languages available: English, Dutch, German, Russia, French, Spanish, Chinese or Japanese) Offer is available until 31 December 2015, subject to availability.
