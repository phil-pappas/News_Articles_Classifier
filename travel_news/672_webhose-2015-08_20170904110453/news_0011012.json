The partnership will be known in the U.S travel industry as Cuba Travel Experts. \nWhile there has been abundant news coverage about Cuba in the recent months since Presidents Castro and Obama announced the renewal of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, travel industry veteran and eGroup President, Robert M. Burke, III, realised there exists a general sense of lack of information within the U.S. Travel Agency community about booking their clients to Cuba. \"The rules for Americans traveling to Cuba are different than anywhere else in the world\" said Burke, \"and the email databases managed and maintained by eGroup will do the heavy lifting required to inform and educate professional tourism decision makers in the U.S. on how to book their clients\", he added, \" and I am particularly delighted to be partnering with Blanco International, one of the most respected Air Charter companies serving Cuba\". Burke tapped Daniel Blanco, a Public Flight Charterer who brings over 45 years of experience working with Cuba, and a trusted Charterer for the hundreds of agencies across the U.S. that have entrusted their passengers to Mr. Blancos care for the past 20 years. I am extremely happy that the U.S. and Cuba have decided to treat each other as sovereign nations\" said Blanco, \"It is time for all Americans to discover that Cubas lands are bountiful, its people are humble, happy and proud, and they will welcome all with open arms. Americans will discover, in person, that Cuba is a safe country and its people and its wonderful music will be the best ambassadors for Cuba,\" he concluded. Blanco will leverage not only its own public and private charter flights to transport travelers to the island, but its longstanding business relationship with Cubas National Tourism Agency, Havanatur. The Blanco/eGroup collaboration, Cuba Travel Experts, will eliminate the difficult learning curve required to enter the Cuba travel market, and will assist both U.S. Retail Travel Agents and MICE Buyers with the intricacies involved in booking travel to Cuba, from documentation to check-in and arrival. At the same time, eGroup will leverage its expertise, knowledge and relationships in both the Retail and MICE markets to capitalise on its ability to communicate Cuba's People-to-People programs to both of these lucrative markets through their email marketing platform. Cuba Travel Experts, with Blancos 45 years of experience working with Cuba, and the ability to tap into eGroup's email databases of 129,000+ Retail Travel Agents and over 55,000 MICE Buyers in the U.S., is uniquely positioned to offer any and all licensed People-to-People tour operators the opportunity to sell these programs throughout the U.S. to the American traveler.
