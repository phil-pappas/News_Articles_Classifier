With all the different genres and types available on the market, we as gamers can get easily lost searching for the perfect game, or at least the one that suits us the most. So as usual, we decided to go through the best free rpg games that are available online now. We will try to review the most featured ones according to the gamers. So let`s see what we have on the list. \n1- My Friend Pedro \nThe game might not have the amazing graphics that we see nowadays for the top online RPG games, yet if you are a Max Payne fan, then this is the game for you. Flip in slow motion to avoid the bullets and get rid of the bad guys. It might be a game with a short story board, but at the end it will leave you breathless. \n2- Critical Annihilation \nAnother low graphics, yet an amusing game out there. Prepare yourself to kill endless waves of aliens my friend. You will be equipped with guns, rockets and an AC-138 gunship (no you didn`t read the last one wrong). Happy Alien Killing! \n3- Ichabod Crane \nMoving on to the puzzle games, this is considered to be one of the best rpg games in its category. You are supposed to be a robot with a detachable head. The most amazing part is that head will be the reason for you achieving progress in the game, which makes it a lot more different and amusing than other boring puzzle games. Left click your mouse and Violaa, your head is on the floor, Should I carry on with what happens next? No, I would prefer that you find out yourself! Enjoy solving the puzzle! \n4- The Very organized Thief \nYes the game is as exciting as the title. And guess what? You are the thief. You will be dropped in different locations with nothing but torchlight and a list of items to rob. So go ahead and search the house for the items. \nI hope that this list of games will keep you busy enough (and happy) to stay on your PC for a very long time. The games may not be like others we high graphics and complicated game plays. But Hey, their story boards are really interesting and don`t forget the most amazing part.
