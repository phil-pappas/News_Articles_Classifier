Diego, Diane and Boyce Avenue, who are deeply proud of their heritage, discuss what it means for them to be Latino and American, their passion for human rights and the empowerment of the Latino community.\n“We are proud to partner with such admired and compelling influencers in the Latino community who truly embody what the #LoveTravels campaign is all about,” said Stacey Milne, Vice President, Portfolio Marketing Strategy and Planning, Marriott International. “Marriott embraces all and is dedicated to finding inspiring stories that illustrate how people pursue their dreams, and bring their passions to life when they travel.”\nDiego Boneta“My Mexican, Spanish and American heritage makes me feel like a citizen of the world and connected to all people,” explained Diego Boneta. “For me #LoveTravels is an amazing way for other people to feel the same way and to understand how travel can change their lives.”\n“Some people travel on vacation to get away from it all, but I travel to get to it all,” said Diane Guerrero. “I’m passionate about issues such as human rights and immigration reform and when I travel, I get to support this work, discovering new things and meeting new people.”\n“Traveling allows us to expand our cultural boundaries, which in turn inspires our artistic passions,” added Alejandro Luis Manzano. “Expressing our art through performing allows us to share our #LoveTravels story with the world.”\nBoyce AvenueFor the campaign’s creative vision, Marriott has joined with LatinWorks, an award-winning, full-service cultural branding firm, and renowned photographer, Braden Summers, whose photos of Diane Guerrero, Diego Boneta, Boyce Avenue, and everyday travelers will be featured throughout the campaign.
