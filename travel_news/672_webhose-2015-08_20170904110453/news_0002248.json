Looking for reasons why Southwest Airlines' (NYSE: LUV) on-time performance is falterin g this summer? Look no further than Chicago's near-in Midway Airport , where Southwest flights represent the vast majority of arrivals and departures happening there on a daily basis. Data provider FlightView's just-released airport performance data for July clearly highlights why Southwest has a problem at Midway, the largest hub in the Southwest route system and one of 254 airports in the United States for which FlightView provides monthly performance data. According to FlightView, 73.2 percent of all flights arriving at Midway came in on time in July. Coincidentally or not, that percentage closely approximates the 73.1 percent on-time arrivals number Southwest recorded in July throughout its entire route system, according to FlightView. But — and it's a big but — FlightView performance data for Midway Airport showed that only 62.1 percent of all flights departing Midway actually departed on time during July, clearly suggesting Southwest had significant problems turning around flights at Midway and getting them back out on time. Southwest and its CEO Gary Kelly have struggled for years to improve on-time performance at Midway. But this summer the airline decided to expand its flight schedule, adding more early morning and late evening departures and arrivals at major airports in its system. That move may have put additional strain on Midway that Southwest operations there could not handle, leading to the striking difference in on-time arrival and on-time departure performance at the airport. In marked contrast, for Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport , where Southwest also has a major hub, FlightView showed 70.6 percent of all flights arriving on time at that airport, and nearly the same percentage of departures, 70.2 percent, actually departing on time. Meanwhile, at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , where United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) has its largest hub and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) has its second largest hub, there was also a difference in the airport's on-time arrival performance in July and its on-time departure numbers, but not nearly so pronounced as at Midway. FlightView data showed 74.2 percent of all flights at O'Hare arriving on time, and 69.8 percent of all flights departing on time. \nWant Chicago Travel   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:53:30.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
