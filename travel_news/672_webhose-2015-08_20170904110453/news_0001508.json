We are looking forward to announcing the miaList winners in September.” Nominees met the judging panel at Altitude London and Goosedale in Nottingham on 15 July and 22 July respectively. They were interviewed by Steve Knight, The Meetings Show, Gill Smillie, Conference Venues Countrywide, Lacy Curtis Ward, The Lensbury, Rob Flinter, Park Plaza Victoria, Jo Austin, Lime Venues & Events, and Helen Ashton, First Class Training & Development. The judges were chosen for their extensive knowledge of the industry and commitment to excellence in their own businesses. Lucy Harper, events manager at Brockencote Hall Hotel is one of the nominees: “This is such a prestigious award within the industry and having my name added to the shortlist of professionals is an honour.” Commenting on being shortlisted, Sam Gryckiewicz, conference manager at Moor Hall Conference Centre said, “The highlight of my career so far has been being nominated for the miaList.” Toni Mountford, corporate sales and events team leader at Alton Towers Resort said, “There is no greater compliment than your colleagues taking the time to apply on your behalf because they believe in what you are doing.” This year also sees the introduction of the Team Award. There are a number of teams who make a truly valuable contribution to their businesses and who wins is up to the public vote. Teams from The Barbican Centre, Bovey Castle, The Foresight Centre and Ricoh Arena are hoping the votes will see them crowned as the miaList winners 2015. The final miaList 2015 will be recognised at a celebratory lunch on 28 September at the prestigious Gold AIM accredited Park Plaza Riverbank hotel in London.
