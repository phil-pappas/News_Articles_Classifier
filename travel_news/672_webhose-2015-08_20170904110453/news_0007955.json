Disney’s dream city. Source: Supplied \nFROM a floating habitat straight out of your wildest fantasies, to a place created only for vegetarians, some incredible and outrageous plans for new cities have failed spectacularly. \nIf they had succeeded, the world as we know it would look very different. \nHere are six city masterplans that prove that sometimes, dreams don’t come true. \n1. Disney’s EPCOT \n“It will be a perfect city with dependable public transportation, a soaring civic centre covered by an all-weather dome, and model factories concealed in green belts that were readily accessible to workers housed in idyllic suburban subdivisions nearby.” \nWhen Walt Disney dreamed, he dreamed big. \nHis ‘Project X’ was no exception: it was an outrageous plan to create The Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). Disney fully intended it to become a real city, a utopia that would be the opposite of the not-so-perfect life he lived in Los Angeles during the 1950s. \nSo he snapped up 112 square kilometres of swampland in Florida, a size he considered would be possible to “hold all the ideas you could imagine”. \nThe city was intended to be home to a community of 20,000 people. Shaped in a circular design, it would feature a 30-storey hotel as its centrepiece, along with an industrial park and an airport of the future. All traffic would be forced underground to free up the streets for pedestrians. The radial design of the city. Source: Supplied \nAccording to Disney, life in EPCOT would be a breeze — apart from his proposition that people work forever. \n“It will be a planned, controlled community, a showcase for American industry and research, schools, cultural and educational opportunities,” Disney said of the project at the time. “In EPCOT, there will be no slum areas because we won’t let them develop. \n“There will be no landowners and therefore no voting control. People will rent houses instead of buying them, and at modest rentals. There will be no retirees; everyone must be employed.” \nHe even made a movie about his elaborate plans, shortly before his death in 1966. While his dream was never fully realised, the EPCOT plan instead was modified into what is today known as Walt Disney World theme park in Orlando, Florida. The International Shopping Center, 1966.

The grand plan for Octagon City was created in 1856 and was meant to be an oasis for those who shunned meat. \nIt had a striking design in an octagonal shape with eight radial roads leading to the town square. However, the ambitious plan was never fully realised. When they couldn’t find enough people to populate the city, they let carnivores in. But those who did inhabit the city quickly left once they discovered that instead of a vibrant city, all that had been built was one log cabin next to a few tents. \nUtopia, it was not. Vegetarian city. Source: Supplied \n3. Triton City \nThis bold design was proposed by scientist and philosopher Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s. It was hoped to become an autonomous, floating utopia that could house up to 6000 people. \nThe tetrahedron-shaped city would be resistant to tsunamis and desalinate the water it would float on for consumption. It would also have low operating costs. \nA wealthy Japanese businessman had commissioned Fuller to design the city in Tokyo Bay, but he died. Then, the US Department of Urban Developmen further commissioned Fuller’s design. The city of Baltimore was interested and lobbied to have it moored off Chesapeake Bay. \nHowever, the project never eventuated. The $670 million price tag might have had something to do with it.

Germania \nHitler had planned to fill the city with monuments honouring the Third Reich, and himself. It would also have included the world’s largest Olympic stadium, and an arch based on Paris’ Arc de Triomphe but much bigger. \nIt was also to have included an underground highway — and work began on some of the tunnel but was never completed because of the outbreak of war.

Dongtan, China \nIt was meant to be the world’s first ecocity, and a shining example to the developing world. \nCramming in half-a-million people in a sustainable paradise on an island in the Yangtze River, Dongtan would be different to the rest of the region which was rife with pollution and overcrowding. The planned but doomed Dongtan City. Source: Supplied \nIt would produce its own energy from solar, wind and biofuel, and recycled waste would fertilise the fields. There would also be organic farms producing most of the city’s food, and transport would be powered by electricity or hydrogen — there would be no cars. \nIn 2005, former British prime minister Tony Blair signed a deal for the groundbreaking plan with then-Chinese president Hu Jintao to build Dongtan. \nIt was meant to become home for 50,000 people by 2020, yet the utopia never became a reality. In 2006 the project was halted indefinitely after it was discovered that the site had languished untouched, following a corruption scandal and financial problems. It was left to languish.

They were a bold answer to the problem of overcrowding in Tokyo. \nThe spheres would be anchored to mountains, or would simply drift around the world. \nBut the idea didn’t take off.
