Ad Feedback \nQantas, which was one of the first airlines to introduce this class, has had great success with it from its commencement in 2008. \nSince then, many carriers have introduced similar seats, offering more legroom, typically with better food and facilities, for those who cannot afford the lie-flat luxury of business or first class. \nSingapore Airlines is retrofitting 19 Airbus A380s and 19 Boeing 777-300ERs to include several dozen premium economy seats. It also will put the wider seats on new A350 planes it will receive starting in early 2016. \nThe airline's A380 superjumbos feature 36 premium economy seats, with 28 on board the 777s. Fares for one-way flights to Singapore next month are about A$1750 (NZ$1962). This compares to economy class fares at a price of about A$520 and business class fares of about A$2800. The airline says return premium economy flights on the route start from A$2240. \nThe Sydney-Singapore route is the first to feature the new class, with 18 more routes to follow, starting with Hong Kong and London later this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:40:18.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
