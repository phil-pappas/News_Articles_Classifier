Passenger who arrived late for flight to high school reunion... Rare 'fire rainbow' cloud spotted above South Carolina beach... Dennis has long been fond of photographing these majestic animals, though he admits that he especially likes to do so in the warmer months when temperatures aren't at a shocking -40 degrees Celsius, as they are in the winter.\n'Besides being arguably the largest carnivore on earth, they are also one of the most adorable,' he tells My Modern Met . 'Their demeanor is mostly calm and inquisitive.'\nThe bears were spotted frolicking in a field of pink fireweed, as well as occasionally chewing on the plants themselves (pictured)\nDennis has been snapping photos of the bears for about 20 years, even serving as chief photographer for an Arctic adventure company\nThe silly photographs were taken near Hudson Bay in northern Manitoba, Canada, near the Churchill Wild lodges\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Ben Nevis from high above: Aerial filming with a drone\nWatch video Watch: Man films 1973 Varig Flight 820 plane crash site\nWatch video AlItalia flight forced to make emergency landing in storm\nWatch video Cliff Richard pays tribute to Cilla and sings Oh Faithful One\nWatch video Perrie Edwards breaks down while singing Little Mix's The End\nWatch video Paul O'Grady gives brilliant eulogy at Cilla Black's funeral\nWatch video Girl pops giant six-year-old pimple with disgusting results\nWatch video Bodyguard smashed his boss's uninsured £1m Pagani Zonda\nWatch video Woman finds out on air that her husband is on Ashley Madison\nWatch video Cilla Black's son delivers a touching eulogy at funeral\nWatch video First look at new star-studded X Factor panel in latest trailer\nWatch video Jimmy Tarbuk and Christopher Biggins pay tribute to Cilla Black\nHe added: '[I]t's not just their colour that makes them a favourite target of my camera. They have a slow, ambling gait as they drift about looking for anything that moves. It looks like they don't have a care in the world, and that there is nothing they are afraid of.\n'It is amazing to spend quality time with my favourite animal. Wild animals need to become somewhat used to your presence and learn that you won't harrass them - that's when they begin to behave normally.'\nBut, now that the bears have become used to Dennis, who often frequents the Churchill Wild lodges near Hudson Bay as the resort's chief photographer, he's able to showcase their true private, yet playful nature.\nBut you don't have to be a professional to capture these animals in their natural habitat. The Arctic safari company's outpost is located in the small coastal town of Churchill, known as the 'Polar Bear Capital of the World,' and hosts aspiring shutterbugs of all experience levels.\nA sleepy looking bear is easy to spot in a field of fuschia fireweed, a plant that is native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere\nPeek-a-boo! One majestic bear is spotted peeking his head - and paw - above the flowers as he lounges on his back\nDennis admits that while he enjoys photographing the bears in the winter, as well, the milder summer temperatures - and brightly contrasting colours - make for a truly special sight\nDennis explains that the bears are his favourite animal, largely due to their ambling gait, which makes them look as though they don't have a care in the world\nWhile Churchill Wild offers amateur photographers the chance to get up close and personal on an Arctic safari, Dennis warns that the animals do need to get used to your presence\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Ben Nevis from high above: Aerial filming with a drone\nWatch video Watch: Man films 1973 Varig Flight 820 plane crash site\nWatch video AlItalia flight forced to make emergency landing in storm\nWatch video Cliff Richard pays tribute to Cilla and sings Oh Faithful One\nWatch video Perrie Edwards breaks down while singing Little Mix's The End\nWatch video Paul O'Grady gives brilliant eulogy at Cilla Black's funeral\nWatch video Girl pops giant six-year-old pimple with disgusting results\nWatch video Bodyguard smashed his boss's uninsured £1m Pagani Zonda\nWatch video Woman finds out on air that her husband is on Ashley Madison\nWatch video Cilla Black's son delivers a touching eulogy at funeral\nWatch video First look at new star-studded X Factor panel in latest trailer\nWatch video Jimmy Tarbuk and Christopher Biggins pay tribute to Cilla Black\nOnce the bears are sure that the photographers won't harass them, they are free to show off their more private, playful side\n'Besides being arguably the largest carnivore on earth, they are also one of the most adorable,' Dennis tells website My Modern Met\nRead more: Interview: Playful Photos of Polar Bears Frolicking in Flower Fields During Summer - My Modern Met DENNISFAST", "external_links": ["http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/dennis-fast-polar-bears-in-flower-fields", "http://dailym.ai/1EGRrwg", "http://www.dennisfast.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-21T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:57:22.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
