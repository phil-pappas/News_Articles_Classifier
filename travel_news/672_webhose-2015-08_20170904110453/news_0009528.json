The MICHELIN XLD D1 tire is being replaced with the 26.5R25 XTXL E4/L4, 29.5R25 XTXL E4/L4 and 35/65R33 XTXL E4/L4.\n\"New generations of more powerful loader models are the new normal on many construction and quarry sites,\" said Jamey Fish , director of earthmover marketing for Michelin North America . \"This tire enables operators to maximize their operating time and face their productivity challenges head-on. And longer tire life is better for the environment with fewer raw materials being used and fewer tires to be recycled.\"\nThe XTXL E4/L4 is equipped with Michelin's patented B2 technology, which reduces rim slip thanks to a new flat bead wire, which strengthens the clamping force on the wheel and increases its contact surface with the rim, compared to the previous-generation MICHELIN XLD D1 tire. The tire also benefits from more solid steel cables, increased metal mass, thicker sidewalls and a new steel belt offering increased protection against punctures in the tread area. It has a greater load capacity of nearly 36 tons for the 35/65R33 tire size, than the previous generation MICHELIN XLD D1, thanks to its cable-reinforced carcass. The shoulder design helps the tire to cool more quickly, while the central zone and its large, beefy lugs are cut resistant to improve both damage resistance and traction capability. Wide grooves and channels provide traction and grip on graded and loose ground conditions.\n(1) Compared with MICHELIN ® XLD D1 tire\nAbout Michelin\nDedicated to the improvement of sustainable mobility, Michelin designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.
