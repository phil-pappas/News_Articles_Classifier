In 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts opened a new Sheraton hotel in Samsun, a city famed for its manufacturing businesses as well as providing a major port to the Black Sea. Hilton is set to open two properties in Eskisehir, another Turkish business centre.\nThe TOPHOTELPROJECTS report puts Turkey in 3rd place in the Middle East for hotel construction, behind only the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Caroline List, International Sales Manager at TOPHOTELPROJECTS commented: “Turkey has emerged as a leading tourist destination with a massive growth in hotel construction. Trends we have witnessed for the Turkish market include recreational complexes, which can also be used for day trips, as well as hotels with spa facilities. Hotel construction is rife in Istanbul, which currently hosts over 800 properties and 50,000 rooms, but there is a clear move towards the regional cities popular for manufacturing companies including Samsun, Eskisehir, Ankara, and Izmir.”\nOver 30 Turkish manufacturers set to arrive in Dubai in September for The Hotel Show include Elemegi Furniture & Design, an architectural company undertaking turnkey hotel applications, design and restoration with the capacity of a 10,000sqm production area, and high-profile clients including Rixos, Nobu and Burberry. Porland Porselen, a leading Turkish porcelain manufacturer with production of approximately 70 million units per year. Dok-San, one of the largest home textiles manufacturers in the country. Maya Tekstil, a bedding manufacturer producing over 3,000 pillows and quilts daily. Hisar, cookware and accessories manufacturers, named one of the top 20 leading companies by IBM’s “Production Systems Catalog”. Dressbest, a quality uniforms manufacturer serving for hospitality, health and spa, airlines and government entities, and Sandalyeci, furniture manufacturers who already have a showroom in Dubai and have supplied to various hotels and restaurants after exhibiting at The Hotel Show for 2 years.\nEngin Ertekin, The Hotel Show Dubai’s Turkish representative based in Istanbul said: “Dubai, UAE and the entire Middle East are always target markets for Turkish companies for all industries. There has been a continuous and significant increase in the last few years in part due to the general economic stagnation in Europe which is the number one region for Turkey’s foreign trade. This is pushing Turkish exporters to focus more on the Middle East and also to find new markets.”\nThe Hotel Show Dubai 2015 takes place 28-30th September at the Dubai World Trade Centre.
