Gordon Ramsay (Las Vegas) and Bobby Flay (nationwide) have similar concepts this column has visited before, but the big difference is that Symon has solidly stuck to his Midwestern roots and hometown feel, and you’d never guess by visiting one of his B Spot eateries that there were others.\nThe Cleveland native has been a staunch supporter of his hometown, and is largely credited with jumpstarting the city’s revived downtown food scene with his fine-dining flagship Lola. But the eight B Spot locations cover more ground, from Cleveland and Columbus into Michigan and Indiana. Symon won the prestigious James Beard Award for regional Best Chef. He’s also won a daytime Emmy for The Chew , is a frequent guest on several Cooking Channel and ABC shows, and is the author of several cookbooks including Carnivore , full of “recipes for meat lovers.”\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Las Vegas\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Bobby Flay's Burger Palace\nMeat lovers are the audience for the B Spot, where the letter stands for both burgers and brats, the beloved sausages of the Midwest. The full-service locations have a neighborhood-tavern-meets-barbecue-joint feel, with heavy dark wood booths, industrial metal chairs, concrete floors, semi-open kitchen and a lively central island bar. Rolls of paper towels and half a dozen sauces on the table complete the roll-up-your-sleeves comfort food aesthetic. There are also quick-serve versions in Cleveland’s First Energy (NFL) and Quicken Loans (NBA) arenas and in a food court within the city’s downtown Horseshoe Casino (one of the only locations that does not serve alcohol, ironic given its 21-and-over crowd).\nReason to visit: Signature Yo!, Fat Doug and Porky burgers; any other burger; Lola Fries\nUSA TODAY\nMac & Cheese Burger? You must try this comfort food!\nThe food: Options abound and choosing what to eat is a major challenge. There are three “signature” burgers, including the Fat Doug, which has famously won “Best Burger in America” four of the past five years. The prize is at the annual Miami Burger Bash that accompanies the South Beach Food & Wine Festival, probably the nation’s highest profile such burger competition. The Fat Doug tops a delicious patty with pastrami, Swiss cheese and coleslaw. Another signature and my favorite is the Yo!, with fried salami, capicola, hot peppers, provolone cheese and shasha sauce, a hot banana pepper puree. The Yo! is spicy but not too spicy and perfectly balanced for both flavors and textures, with a nice crunchy contrast. The final signature is the Porky, with pulled pork, cole slaw, and barbecue sauce. There is a theme of sandwich-style construction here, and to oversimplify, the three signatures could be described as a really good pastrami and Swiss, Italian or pulled pork sandwich crossed with really good burgers.\nThere are also nearly a dozen other predesigned burger choices, from classic cheeseburger to versions topped with things like chorizo, avocado, fried egg and the crazy spicy Atomic, with ghost chilis, jalapenos and habanero sauce. Then there is a slate of build-your-own burgers, with 30 toppings, including nine cheeses (cheese whiz to feta) and seven meats (chorizo to bacon). All of the B Spot beef creations begin with Symon’s custom blend of Black Angus that has never received hormones or antibiotics, a distinction that puts it squarely among a tiny minority of restaurant burgers. For choosier diners, this alone is reason to visit. Besides beef patties, there are also turkey, chicken and veggie options, and even the locally beloved bologna “burger,” whose patty is a single thick slab of griddled bologna waiting to be dressed (it’s also a topping!). On its own the bologna has the taste and consistency of a bland German sausage like knockwurst, and would be kind of boring, but it makes a surprisingly good canvas for the pickles and mustard it comes with (to start). Still, it is tough to pass up the ground beef burger. The myriad burger imaginings are served on excellent brioche buns, a key area where many could-be great burgers come up short.\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Elevation Burger feeds growing organic appetite\nThat would be more than enough, but there is also a slew of brats with an equally offbeat array of toppings. The sausage is pretty basic but the rolls are exceptional, and Cleveland’s famed “Stadium Mustard,” the city’s signature condiment, is perfect for the bratwurst. The smooth brown mustard has been a local specialty since 1890, found an audience at Indians baseball games, and is now sold in supermarkets. If there is something regional and beloved, Symon uses it, from Stadium Mustard to the pickles from Tony Packo’s, a legendary Toledo hot dog joint, on his pickle bar. The bologna may be old fashioned, but locals like it.\nThis also keeps a definitively casual spin on the place, with lots of salami and pulled pork but no foie gras. In this vein, the side order of “cracklings,” or fried pork rinds, is unremarkable but worth considering just because it's under three bucks and rarely seen at celebrity chef eateries. Another beloved local dish is the fries at his fancier Lola eatery, so Symon added them to the B Spot menu. Highly addictive, Lola Fries are thin European-style frites generously seasoned with salt and rosemary. The pickle bar is excellent and diverse — as if there were not enough choices for sandwich toppings already — with eight options from hot pepper rings to kimchee.\nUSA TODAY\nRave review: Athenian burger at Utah's Apollo chain\nThe variety is staggering, the quality matches it, everything tastes great, the service is good, and the prices quite reasonable — what’s not to like? Perhaps that’s why the B Spot has been growing fast, with the latest location, Indianapolis, just opened.\nPilgrimage-worthy?: Yes for burger devotees who want to try the one that won America’s Best Burger, just a great casual choice for everyone else.\nRating: Yum! (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!)\nPrice: $$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive)\nDetails: Eight locations in and around Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Detroit; bspotburgers.com\nUSA TODAY\nLarkburger: Building a better burger, Colorado-style\nMORE: Read previous columns\nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.
