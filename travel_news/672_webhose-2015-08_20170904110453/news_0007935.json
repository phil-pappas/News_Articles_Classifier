Every morning you’d go in to buy your bread, have a coffee and watch the world go by. It’s in the centre of the square and everyone wanders past, so you really feel you’re in Italy. With a coffee I might have a little brioche filled with marmellata – apricot or apple jam. If I wanted something savoury, it would be a cheese and ham toastie. Gambarini Umberto Piccolo Bar, Piazza Vittorio 45, Bardi (0039 0525 72220). Coffee and a pastry about €5. Lunch Sorelle Picchi in Parma is one of my favourites; Picchi is the surname and there were two sisters. It was always this place I’d go to if I was in Parma for the day. I might have a starter of L’Oro di Parma (“Parma’s gold”) – typical cold cuts of the region, such as culatello, coppa, prosciutto ham and salami – or a trio of Parmesan cheeses: from the plains, from the mountains and from a particular breed of red cow. Afterwards I might order tortelli with pumpkin, or cappelletti in brodo. Most of what British people think of as Italian food comes from Emilia-Romagna Photo: AP/FOTOLIA The other great place for lunch is Citta d’Umbria in Tosca di Varsi, 15 minutes’ drive from Bardi, where I’ve been for many a family occasion. They do these amazing roasts such as veal and wild boar, some typical pasta dishes – tortelli, cappelletti, lasagne – and torta fritta [fried dough parcels], torta di patate and other traditional specialities. It’s been run by the Labadini-Zanelli family for more than 70 years – and it’s an institution. Trattoria Sorelle Picchi, Strada Luigi Carlo Farini 27, Parma (0039 0521 233 528; trattoriasorellepicchi.com ). Three courses €20-€50, without drinks. Citta d’Umbria, Localita Mornasso 5, Tosca di Varsi-Parma (0039 0525 759103; trattoriacittadumbria.it ). Three courses €22-€35, without drinks. Fine dining I once went to Osteria Francescana, Massimo Bottura’s place, which has three Michelin stars. It was incredible, probably the most understated and simplest three-star food I’ve ever eaten. Again, you might begin with cold meats – culatello aged for 42 months, or Parma ham aged for 36 months – or a starter of cauliflower and red shrimp terrine, or perhaps aubergine with cherry tomatoes, burrata [mozarella made with cream] and anchovies. Mains include tortellini in broth, ravioli of foie gras, leek and truffle, and Emilian tagliatelle with hand-chopped ragú. It was so delicious, because Massimo keeps that ethos of what Italian food is – it’s about the produce and simplicity, not overcomplicating things. Last year I took four of my cooks there and we were all blown away. It was simple stuff, so delicious. As a little extra after our main course he did cappelletti made with reduced double cream and filled with Parma ham and cheese. Osteria Francescana, Via Stella 22, Modena (0039 059 223912; osteriafrancescana.it ). Three courses €130-€190 without drinks; “Sensations” tasting menu €195 (12 courses), paired wines €140 extra; “Tradition in Evolution” tasting menu (nine courses), paired wines €110 extra. • Gourmet Italy: what to eat and drink in Umbria • Gourmet Italy: what to eat and drink in Sicily Osteria Francescana serves &quot;the most understated and simplest three-star food I've ever eaten&quot; An aperitif It would be Bar Enzo or Caffe Centrale in Bardi, and nothing too challenging to drink: an Aperol spritz or a glass of white wine or prosecco. Young people go to those places a lot, and they might have some crisps, a sandwich or a toasted sandwich; you’re in the middle of the hills and these are places for locals. If you were staying in one of the bigger cities, you might have arancini [fried rice balls], salami or olives. Bar Enzo di Marzani Luigi, Via A Moro 1, Bardi (0039 0525 72377). Caffe Centrale, Via P Cella 45, Bardi (0039 0525 71621; caffecentralebardi.it ). Drink €3.50 at both, maybe €4 with a snack. Dinner In Modena there are little streets that are really romantic at night, and Hosteria Giusti is on one of them. Run for years by a father, mother, son and daughter team, it’s an old butcher’s shop with a lovely salumeria [charcuterie shop] at the front. The restaurant at the back is where they once killed the beef, so they have these gulleys where the blood used to run. Across the alleyway is an amazing wine cellar. I first went there more than 15 years ago. There was no menu and they cooked for you whatever they had. Now it’s a lot more famous and they do have a menu: things fried bread with “lardo” [white, cured pork fat], fried cotechino sausage, beef cheek, and pork fillet cooked with onions and balsamic vinegar. The father died two years ago but the mum has been in the kitchen all her life and does this amazing saltcod brandade. I took four of my chefs there, and the next week they were all trying to get it as good as hers. None of them did. • Gourmet Italy: what to eat and drink in Tuscany • Gourmet Italy: what to eat and drink in Puglia Modena Photo: AP/FOTOLIA For pizza I’d recommend La Barraca, just outside Bardi – a 10-minute drive. It’s right on the Ceno river that runs through the region, a tributary of the Taro River, so it’s atmospheric at night. It’s quirky, and you can sit outside under these vines. I’d have a pizza margherita or one made with prosciutto cotto [cooked ham], funghi [wild mushrooms] and black olives. Simple but perfect. Hosteria Giusti, Vicolo Squallore 46, Modena (0039 059 222 533; hosteriagiusti.it ). Three courses €40-€60, without drinks Ristorante Pizzeria La Baracca, Localita Ponte Al Ceno 208, Bardi (0039 0525 71149; ristorantelabaracca.com ). Pizza €8-€12.
