Its parent company has decided to take this cream of the crop and brand it as Sheraton Grand. \nThough the announcement could appear to be just a new commercial strategy, it’s actually a significant development for tourists looking to make the most of a luxury holiday around the world. In this case, travelers will now direct themselves to the “Sheraton Grand” catalog to choose their stays. \nThis new division guarantees tourists “an exemplary hotel offer.” Only establishments equipped with extraordinary gyms, spas that dreams are made of and rooms with “sophisticated design and precision workmanship,” and that are in specific locations “ranging from big cities to spectacular beaches,” can be a part of this network of addresses. They must also stand out in customer satisfaction. \nOne hundred hotels are set to receive the “Sheraton Grand” label before 2017. The first to be so designated are the Bangalore Hotel — Brigade Gateway in India, the Beijing Dongcheng Hotel in China, the Sheraton Hotel Dubai, the Sheraton Hotel Edinburgh in Scotland, the Rio Hotel & Resort in Brazil, the Sheraton Grande Ocean Resort in Japan, the Sheraton Sukhumvit in Thailand, the Sheraton Taipei Hotel, the Tokyo Bay Hotel and the Sheraton Grande Walkerhill in South Korea. — AFP-Relaxnews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:41:08.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
