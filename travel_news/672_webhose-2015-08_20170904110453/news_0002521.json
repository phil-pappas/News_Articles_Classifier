Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 03, 2015 Crystal Esprit Adv: \nInformation was received that the latest cruiseliner of Crystal Cruises - the Crystal Esprit, will take to her maiden voyage in December this year and visit the Seychelles’ archipelago. The all-suite ship offers only 62 cabins and a corresponding number of passengers at a time, giving the cruise the character of almost a private charter. Small enough to cruise between the inner islands of the Seychelles, the Crystal Esprit however will also be able to sail to the outer islands and perhaps, that is yet to be confirmed, anchor off the famous Aldabra Atoll to allow the passengers a trip back in time, when setting foot on the proverbial Garden of Eden, perhaps less famous than the Galapagos but then, very much more exclusive and very much more untouched. \nSeychelles Tourism has been keenly interested to have a smaller cruiseliner based at Port Victoria, for a season or longer, to offer cruise passengers the option of a fly-cruise program from the Seychelles to other Indian Ocean Vanilla Islands, or even allow for shorter cruises around the Seychelles’ archipelago where passengers can stay on board overnight but spend the day on shore on one of the many islands. Additional equipment on board like a tender, Zodiac speed boats and even a small submarine will no doubt enhance the cruise experience of those passengers who sign up for such a unique trip to such a unique destination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T08:16:23.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
