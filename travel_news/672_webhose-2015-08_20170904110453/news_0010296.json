Such is the buzz of this electrifying city that to drift off into the land of nod, I found completely impossible. Wandering around sidewalks 20 years ago, especially in the middle of the night, was inadvisable in the extreme, and lo and behold I witnessed, perhaps not unsurprisingly, my first mugging.\nRidiculously, I gave chase to the attacker, but fortunately my legs failed to reach the required speed to mount any kind of pursuit.\nToday, the city that never sleeps, is far more docile.\nThe crime rate is at a “historic low” and the only place you’re likely to be mugged is in the souvenir shops.\nWhile the hurly burly of 24/7 New York accosts the senses in a frenetic fashion, you can – and you should – take a walk on the wild (garden) side.\nKnown as the High Line , this urban park is built on the original elevated railway tracks that used to carry goods to the factories of Manhattan’s West Side.\nThe line was shut down in 1980 and was derelict for years. Luckily, it was saved from the developer’s wrecking ball by a couple of enterprising local residents with campaigning zeal, and now it attracts more than five million visitors a year.\nBecause this is New York, the 1.5-mile long park isn’t just any old stroll in the park.\nBeautifully reshaped with lush greenery of every description, there are sculptures, artworks and even a children’s area where the original beams and girders have been stripped back to create a sunken playground. The views as you wind your way around the old industrial buildings, opening up vistas of the Hudson River and New Jersey shoreline, are quite magical.\nStunning views: One of many apartment houses newly constructed along the High Line\nI met up with my mother-in-law on the walk, rather bizarrely. She was spending a few days in the Big Apple with an engaging group of pals, all of a certain age but with boundless enthusiasm for\nthe high life and indeed the high line.\nWe spent well over an hour meandering along the track, admiring the views and the swish apartments which have now completed the transformation of this former industrial heartland.\nIf you want the full lowdown on the High Line, there’s a guided tour available every Tuesday at 6:30pm and Saturday at 10am from May through to September.\nYou can even go stargazing on Tuesday nights, courtesy of the Amateur Astronomer’s Association and with the use of a high-powered telescope.\nOr if you fancy something more down to earth, there are Tai Chi lessons every Tuesday morning. For those seeking an even slower pace of life, there’s meditation on a Wednesday morning.\nNew York... they think of everything.\nI even fell prey to the charms of a Buddhist monk on the High Line (at least I think he was Buddhist), who persuaded me to part with a $10 bill (no mean feat) in return for two dubious plastic bracelets. The proceeds, he appeared to suggest, were going to rebuild some temple or other. All part of the experience (thehighline.org).\nAfter completing the most leisurely and pleasurable walk possible, we stopped off at the newly opened Bubby’s restaurant close by in the Meatpacking District. In typically brash style, their verdict on their abilities is as follows: “Our service is professional and our food impeccable.”\nThey’re not wrong. Traditional American grub at its best. I wolfed down General Tso’s chicken meatballs; sweet and spicy, absolutely delicious, followed by a hot cherry pie and chocolate sundae, of which I managed one mouthful as I failed to fend off invading spoons from my lunchtime companions (bubbys.com).\nDown there: The High Line glides across the bustling avenues of Chelsea\nLater that evening and feeling slightly weary from gentle but prolonged exertion, myself and Mrs Jones sought a glittering end to the day by getting our gladrags on for cocktails (or rather cocktail, as we were limiting our expenditure).\nThe Top of the Standard is a wonderfully classy retro bar in the 18-storey Standard hotel – which straddles the High Line – with the most amazing views of the New York skyline. We loved it. Expensive for sure, but worth every cent.\nAfter soaking up the panoramic views, we headed downstairs to the Grill, and enjoyed, pour moi, burger and all the trimmings (like nothing you eat in the UK) and for Mrs Jones, a Caesar salad, again somewhat more tasty than your typical British fare. The service was impeccable, and so entertaining you felt like asking the waiter to join you for a drink (standardhotels.com).\nThe rest of our time in New York was spent walking and walking and walking... though sanctuary in the shape of our hotel, the ultra trendy Row NYC at Times Square, was a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle (rownyc.com).\nIt is, and I can state this without fear of contradiction, impossible to get bored by the sights and sounds of New York, though it is possible to get immensely bored by comparing the really l w prices of female attire compared with the UK.\nArmed with presents to pacify our children for the time spent away on our own (only the second time in 12 years), we showed our mostly adorable twosome snaps of mummy and daddy posing on the High Line. “We love walking,” they said in unison, “can we go?”\nOr maybe, Mr and Mrs Jones will walk the High Line again... on our own.\nGet there British Airways and its partner carrier American Airlines together fly 15 times a day between London and New York.
