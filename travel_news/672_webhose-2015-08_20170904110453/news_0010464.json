It was the first step in a wildly productive two-year span that saw the two-person effort grow into a multi-artist movement including more than 40 members.\nConcert preview Thraxxhouse 7 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 2, at the Crocodile, 2200 Second Ave., Seattle; $12 (206-441-4618 or thecrocodile.com ).\n“We linked up because of our individual talent, and it turned into a lot more than that,” Key said in a phone interview. “We really pushed each other creatively.”\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time Although only 20, Key brings experience to the equation, already having spent time in the local and national spotlight as the sole Seattle member of Southern underground outfit Raider Klan. With his sixth album “AnythingYouNeedHouse” set for release in the fall, he said he aims to “take it to a level I’ve never gotten to before — the industry level.”\nMackned just released “Female,” his fifth album since 2013. VICE magazine’s Noisey imprint called it “one of the most authoritative fusions of trap and cloud rap since A$AP Rocky made his debut with ‘Live. Love. A$AP.’ ”\nThe tracks on “Female,” perhaps the most cohesive Thraxxhouse release to date, move through booming, “turnt-up” trap anthems (“Take the Ship”), washed-out, syrupy Auto-Tune ballads (“Elissa Steamer”) and introspective, candlelit-séance lamentations ( “White Mountains” ).\n“My goal is to become the best artist of all time,” the 22-year-old rapper/producer said in a recent interview. “I wanna touch every genre, I wanna be a household name, all that.”\nThat kind of hustle may have been bred into him from birth. His father is Tony Gable, of seminal Seattle funk/soul group Cold, Bold & Together, and his godfather is world-renowned saxophonist Kenny G. (Ned recalls them rehearsing in his living room when he was growing up.)\nAlso on the bill at the Croc are Los Angeles-based Horse Head and Yung Bruh, who exemplify Thraxxhouse’s versatility. Horse Head’s blend of left-field samples with modern drum programming and heart-on-sleeve lyrics sound more like an Auto-Tuned version of early-’00s emo-punk than anything close to rap. Yung Bruh’s lo-fi, anime-cyberpunk-trap aesthetic — all Samsung flip phones and Hello Kitty backpacks — seems even more surprising, considering he is the son of local legend Ishmael Butler’s (Shabazz Palaces, Digable Planets).\nSoulection-affiliated producer Sango — born and raised in South Seattle — recently linked up with Key on the single “Spark the Night.” Sango will appear as guest DJ for the show, making this one of the biggest gatherings of local talent with beyond-local reach the city has ever seen.\nMike Ramos: On Twitter @ram0s206", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_B", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_dS4_GGwmA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnrKzb1OrEg", "http://www.twitter.com/ram0s206", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_house_(music_genre)"], "published": "2015-08-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:29:54.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
