Travel Updates After Bangkok bombing, what are the risks for Australian travellers in South-East Asian destinations? by: Robyn Ironside National Travel Writer From: Video Soldiers move onlookers back from the shattered windows of a Louis Vuitton shop at Gaysorn shopping plaza across from the Erawan Shrine.

Rough cut (no reporter narration). Reuters 18 Aug 2015 News/World \nSOUTH-EAST Asia is collectively Australia’s favourite holiday playground with huge numbers travelling to Bali, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines each year. \nIn the past year, 2.8 million Aussies visited the region which carries significant appeal due to its proximity to our country, and the availability of cheap airfares and holiday packages. \nBut South-East Asia is also one of the more dangerous parts of the world thanks to the combination of active volcanoes, poor sanitation, high crime rates and terrorist activity. \nThat was highlighted by Monday night’s devastating bombing of one of Bangkok’s busiest intersections, costing at least 22 lives and leaving another 100 people injured. \nThailand, the Philippines and Indonesia currently carry Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warnings for Australians to exercise a “high degree of caution” when travelling there. \nSo exactly what are the risks of visiting South-East Asian countries? The beautiful side of Bangkok ... high-rise venues, such as the Speakeasy Bar at the Muse Hotel (above), are loved by tourists. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied THAILAND \nThailand has seen a noticeable decline in Australian visitors in the past year — from 616,300 to 547,200. The downturn has been attributed to reports of violence, overcrowding in tourist areas and cheaper deals elsewhere. It hasn’t helped that in recent years Thailand has been the country with the highest numbers of deaths among Australian visitors from misadventure, road crashes and natural causes. Monday night’s bombing in Bangkok could deliver a further blow to the country, which has been plagued by civil unrest and the threat of terrorist attacks. Official advice from DFAT is the “security situation remains volatile”. \n“You should pay close attention to your personal security at all times and where possible monitor the local media, including social media, for information about possible new safety or security risks,” the latest advisory said. The number one destination ... Kuta Beach in Bali. Picture: TripADeal.com.au Source: Supplied INDONESIA \nAustralians’ love affair with Indonesia, in particular Bali, seems to know no bounds with more than 1.1 million people travelling there in the year to June — up from 1 million the previous year. \nDirect flights by low cost carriers, a cheap lifestyle and a diverse range of attractions have seen Bali make a strong recovery in the years since the devastating bombings of October 2002. \nBut Aussie travellers continue to be warned to exercise a high degree of caution in the country, and to avoid Central Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua and West Papua. \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warns of a “high threat of terrorist attacks and severe penalties for narcotics offences, including the death penalty”. More recently Bali has also been impacted by the erupting Mount Raung, which has sent clouds of volcanic ash over Denpasar’s Ngurah rai Airport resulting in dozens of flight cancellations. Traditional delights ... markets in Hoi An, Vietnam. Picture: Wendy Wu Tours Source: Supplied VIETNAM \nVietnam has seen incredible growth in Australian tourists in recent years with 231,000 people travelling there in the last year. As a country of amazing food, breathtaking landscapes and friendly people, Vietnam is a serious rival to Thailand’s popularity among travellers. \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises Australians to exercise a “normal degree of caution” in the country, in particular in relation to drug offences. Currently more than 30 Australians are serving long sentences, including life imprisonment for drug trafficking in Vietnam. Travellers are also warned against driving cars or motorcycles due to unfamiliar road conditions and a high risk of crashes. In the 12-months to June, 66 Australians died in Vietnam. Close to heaven ... Boracay Island in the Philippines. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied PHILIPPINES \nThe Philippines is another “hot” destination for Australian travellers, experiencing 12 per cent growth in visitors in the last year to 212,400. More direct flights, and greater awareness of pristine places like Boracay and Cebu have helped drive holiday makers to the island country. But like Vietnam, 66 Australians lost their lives in the Philippines in the last year, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warns of a high threat of terrorist attack and a high crime rate. \nKidnapping is also a considerable risk throughout the Philippines, particularly in coastal and island tourist resorts and dive sites in the Sulu Sea and along the Zamoboanga Peninsula. Australians are advised to exercise a high degree of caution in the Philippines. High-rise beauties ... The Petronas Twin Towers in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. Source: News Limited MALAYSIA \nMalaysia has been one of the few South-East Asian countries to experience a decline in Australian visitors in the last year, with numbers falling 12 per cent from 303,300 in 2013-14 to 265,700. \nOne of the reasons has been the performance of the major airlines servicing Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia Airlines was significantly impacted by the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17, and AirAsia saw a decline in Australian passengers as a result of the QZ8501 crash in the Java Sea. The advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for Australian travellers is to exercise normal safety precautions in Malaysia “as you would in Australia”. \nOne of the biggest concerns is air pollution with visitors urged to limit outdoor activity between June and October when haze levels are high. Travellers are also warned of an increase in dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis in Malaysia in the last year. Change of pace ... Siam Reap in Cambodia. Picture: Rob Maccoll Source: News Limited CAMBODIA \nCambodia is a popular destination for volunteering holidays, with school groups and individuals trekking there annually to help out in orphanages and wildlife refuges. \nIn the last year, 51,700 Australians visited Cambodia up from 50,200 the year before, and it is generally considered a safe destination. The most significant threats to personal safety come from “snatch and grab crimes” against foreigners, and violent demonstrations on the Cambodia/Thai border. The official DFAT advice is to exercise “normally safety precautions, use common sense and look out for suspicious behaviour”. Red, white and not blue ...

A total of 361,600 Australians visited the expanding city in the last year, which is renowned for its extraordinary architecture, colourful history and great cuisine. \nVisitors are urged to make themselves familiar with strict laws for men in particular, in relation to their behaviour towards women. Men who use inappropriate language, or inappropriate touching can find themselves facing heavy penalties including jail or caning. Penalties for drug offences are also severe and include the death penalty. Australians should exercise normal precautions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T05:29:41.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
