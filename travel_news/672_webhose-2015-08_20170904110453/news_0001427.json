The Nation/Kititnun Rodsupan From gentle jostling on a bamboo raft to wild water adventures through the rapids, Thailand has plenty to offer The rains have finally come and although the daily downpours are not much fun for residents of the urban sprawl, the regular monsoon drenchings are good news for adrenaline junkies and adventurers as they signal the arrival of the rafting season across the country. From September to November, Thailand offers everything from epic journeys along the \"Wild Wa\" in Nan for the experienced enthusiast to drowsy drifts along a leafy stream in Phang-nga for beginners. Here's our guide to the country's very best rafting routes. BAMBOO RAFT, PHANG-NGA PROVINCE Best time: all year round One of the best ways to revel in the joys of Mother Nature is a trip on a hand-crafted bamboo raft along the Lam Roo Yai stream in the south of Phang-nga Province. Guided by a single boatman, the raft makes its way slowly along the waterway between towering trees and verdant foliage that has remained unchanged for decades. History tells us that miners used to travel from Phuket along Phang-nga's rivers and steams on bamboo raft searching for tin. Even today, traces of tin can be found on the banks though in such minute traces that it is often mistaken for tiny pebbles. But even if you don't discover a speck of the treasured metal, you will find solace in this peaceful ride along the river, one of the most popular and soothing activities of this region. WA RIVER, NAN PROVINCE Best time: September to November Rising near the border with Laos, the Wa River is one of Thailand's most popular white water courses with everything to offer the keen rafter - rapids up to Class IV rushing noisily through dense walls of evergreen forest and mountain scenery as the watercourse makes it way through one of the country's largest road-less areas. Rafting on the middle section usually involves two to three nights of sleeping out in camps, where fireflies dance shimmering arabesques through the forest canopy and gibbons give you a morning wake-up call. The final stretch takes you through dense tropical jungle where monkeys chatter and laugh at the soaked rafters from the treetops. For more information, call Tourism Authority of Thailand (Phrae Office) at (054) 521 118. MAE KLONG RIVER, TAK PROVINCE Best time: September and October Rafters of all skill levels can enjoy superb mountain scenery along this river, which forms a border with Thong Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, a Unesco World Heritage site. Starting in the remote town of Umphang on the far western fringe of Tak province, you embark on a journey where the pace varies from gentle rapids to tumultuous rides. All around is rain forest and butterflies flitting from tree to tree. You'll occasionally glimpse the palm-thatched villages of the local Karen people and may even stop to visit. The journey takes about four hours before you stop to pitch your tents by the huge Tee Lor Su waterfall or take a car to your resort in town. Fans of outdoor swimming will love Tee Lor Su, a series of limestone cascades that create jade-coloured pools and lagoons. For more information, call (055) 514 341. NAM KHEK, PHITSANULOK PROVINCE Best Time: September and October Thailand's Wa River is known for its crystal clear waters while the Tee Lor Su offers glorious mountain scenery along its banks. But if slick rocks and white water could talk, they'd tell you that the Khek River is one of the country's fastest-flowing waterways and it opens for adventure a month after the beginning of downpours and tropical storms. Fed by the rainfall runoff from the high ranges in Phetchabun, the Khek River is recognised for its wild, red foaming water. The trip combines a series of 20 rapids (Class III and IV) and spectacular wilderness. You'll face challenging rapids with such innocent names as Nang Khoi (Waiting Lady) and experience plenty of wild shake-ups over the course of three hours. For more information, call the Tourist Information Centre at (055) 252 743. MAE TAENG RIVER, CHIANG MAI PROVINCE Best Time: August to November The Sob Kai Rapids, where the Mae Taeng River boils and churns its ways over 10 kilometres of cascades, offers Chiang Mai 's most thrilling rafting experience through the rainforest. The tricky turns and Class III and IV rapids demand fast thinking and action by rafters. Fast as it's furious, rafting down Mae Taeng River, from Baan Sob Koi to Elephant Camp, takes about three hours. The best experience is to watch the rapid pulling half of your rubber raft into the water before spitting it out. Baan Anatta Resort (Facebook.com/BaanAnatta) offers rustic, riverside cottages and arranges the rafting trips. HIN POENG RAPIDS, PRACHIN BURI PROVINCE Best time: August to October Plunging down from Khao Yai's high ranges, the crystal-clear water of Hin Poeng offers superb rafting and glorious mountain scenery. Stretches of easy rafting are suitable for beginners, but there are also Class IV rapids that will challenge even the most expert rafters.
