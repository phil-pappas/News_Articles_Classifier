When we go shopping for new jeans, what we really want is new legs. And when we book a holiday, what we’re hoping to find is a positive new mindset, a healthier lifestyle, an improved relationship. Post-holiday blues aren’t caused by plummeting vitamin D levels, but by the sad recognition that we’ve returned from our two weeks/10 days a little bit sunkissed, perhaps, but ultimately unchanged. It’s buyer’s remorse. In 2002, Alain de Botton published his bestselling travel volume, The Art of Travel , boldly asserting that if we don’t enjoy our summer holidays, it’s all our fault. We fail to ask ourselves what we really want from a journey, and are therefore easy prey for the glossy brochures ushering us to a destination, and didactic guidebooks that guilt-trip us into traipsing joylessly around museums when we’re there. “We are inundated with advice on where to travel to; we hear little of why and how we should go,” De Botton wrote a decade ago. Thirteen years later sees a brand new, revised Penguin edition, The New Art Of Travel , because, although much has changed with an explosion in travel apps and on-line reviews and recommendations - one thing hasn’t: the British public are still terrible at working out what we want from a holiday.

You would imagine that this would result in perfectly-tailored, fulfilling experiences. “But it hasn’t,” insists Alain. “The definition of a holiday has remained static: two weeks in the sun, an 'escape’ from everyday life, and a chance to rest.” There’s nothing wrong with this; it sounds perfectly nice. “But it’s striking that our definition of travel remains so very limited,” he observes. “We are inundated with advice on where to travel to; we hear little of why and how we should go,” Alain de Botton Alain’s answer, as ever, is more thought is needed. We’ve all experienced travel that goes wrong, “in a quiet and essentially psychological way, where the beach holiday doesn’t entirely deliver on its underlying promise of calm, where we get a little bored at the museum, where our relationship isn’t revived by the apparently romantic coastline.” Alain observes that we need to take into consideration the sort of personal journey we want to embark upon, too. The ideal scenario would be a string of “psychotherapeutic travel agencies”, but in their absence he handily provides a “psychological atlas”, i.e. sample holiday prescriptions, that address specific wants and needs in our daily lives. “There are some places that could help with shyness and others with anxiety,” he insists. “Some might be good for reducing egoism and others for helping us to think more clearly about our careers.” It’s an intoxicating concept, so I willingly volunteered to be a test subject for this 'psychological atlas’. Together we assessed my potential ailments, running a swift check-up on my levels of anxiety and stress and the status of my relationship. Eventually we came to a diagnosis: I’m worried about what the future holds. Alain prescribed Detroit as an unlikely holiday destination for Anna My husband’s ongoing job-hunt as a second-career gardener could take us anywhere, we’re between homes with our stuff in storage, my beloved immediate family are living in places as far-flung as Vanuatu, Zambia and California, and at this point in my thirties, I feel I should be “building” something, but I don’t know what, or where. Alain’s prescription: an Airbnb stay in Detroit. According to Alain, Airbnb “accidentally brings us closer to what we really crave from travel, and that’s closeness to a culture, closeness to new people, full immersion in a new way of life.\" But why Detroit? An industrial boomtown which became an economic disaster zone, declining at a rate where it lost a quarter of its population in a decade, doesn’t seem like a good place to for a holiday. On the contrary, says Alain, where better to ponder the concept of impermanence, to come to terms with the fact that I have no idea what the next five years will bring? “The overwhelming tone of the world is upbeat, cheerful, optimistic - yet there can be something comforting about a sight or experience that confirms our most morbid, innermost thoughts,\" he says. In fact, two weeks later, finding myself cycling through the wide, semi-deserted streets in front of its derelict mansions and theatres, Detroit does a lot more for my soul than this. Detroit of 2015 is on the up. Entrepreneurs, artists, musicians and cash-strapped young people are converting derelict buildings into studios, co-working spaces, social enterprises and cafes. In the big, shiny, economically successful cities like London, Paris, New York and LA, young people and new businesses are being suffocated by high rent, and financial woes. In Detroit, people can afford their dreams and I return after a week feeling like I’ve been bathed in bright-eyed optimism. It really was just what I needed. Not all the destinations within Alain’s 'psychological atlas’ are as far from a conventional summer holiday as Detroit. For anxiety, he prescribes a traditional beach holiday at Pefkos Beach in Rhodes . “We may say we want 'the sun’, but really we want calm and to connect with a more carefree version of ourselves,” he says. More interesting is his cure for shyness: an awkward encounter at a corner-shop in the Japanese city of Yokohama. Travel, says de Botton, “has the power to make us a touch braver”. De Botton cheerfully admits that this is intended more to guide us into a new way of thinking about our holidays than to be taken literally; the destinations listed are representative of particular experiences that have proved transformative to him and his friends. Travel has the power to make us a touch braver Alain de Botton In The New Art of Travel he simply attempts to get us to understand the unsung joys of travel, and why we may find ourselves less moved by the Colosseum than by the bookshelf in our Airbnb apartment. If you’re feeling underwhelmed by your summer holiday , the consolations of de Botton’s philosophy will last longer than your tan.
