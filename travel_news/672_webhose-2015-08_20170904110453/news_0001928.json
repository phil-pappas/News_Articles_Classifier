Middle East traffic was also up 13.3% as carriers added new A380s to these routes.\nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said last month’s decision by the Airports Commission to recommend a new third runway at the airport was important to increase trade to all markets around the world.\n“I agree with the prime minister’s comments during the recent trade mission to South East Asia that Britain should be trading more with the rest of the world,” said Holland-Kaye.\n“As the UK’s largest port, Heathrow is the beating heart of Britain’s trading network. Our best exports, whether Scottish salmon or life-saving pharmaceuticals, all pass through Heathrow on their way to markets across the globe. With expansion, we can add connections to new markets, opening up the lucrative trade routes that will secure British prosperity over the coming decades.”\nOverall Heathrow saw 7.29 million passengers pass through the airport, an increase of 4.7 per cent on the same period last year.\nHeathrow also reported that larger, quieter, fuller aircraft continued to be a driver for passenger growth at Heathrow. Seats per aircraft increased 2.3 per cent to 209.6 while passengers per aircraft rose 4.1 per cent to 175.6 and load factors increased 1.8 per cent to 83.8 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:51:37.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
