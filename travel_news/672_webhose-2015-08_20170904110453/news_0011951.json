Lots of people recognised how good she was, and we all encouraged her to become an outside caterer so we could enjoy her delicious delicacies in our own homes feasting with our own friends. In this way I was privileged to have Michelle Garnaut and her cuisine at home for much of our life in Hong Kong.After I left Hong Kong in the late eighties, she started a very successful restaurant of her own, M on the Fringe, in Hong Kong, which sadly I only visited once in the early nineties. In January 1999, however, she was one of the first people to start a fashionable, Western restaurant in Shanghai, called M on the Bund. Luxuriously located right on the Bund, it possessed a view that was breathtakingly beautiful, and was soon frequented by tourists and locals alike. Fortunately, I had a few business trips to Shanghai over those years and had a chance to experience some - but not enough - of her ever-changing menu.Last month, on a business trip to Beijing, I had a chance to stay on for an extra evening, solely for the purpose of having dinner with Michelle in her most recent restaurant, Capital M , which is also strategically and spectacularly located with a view of the amazing gates of Tiananmen Square. We had a table inside the restaurant looking out of the window at the outside terrace. The large terrace in turn faced the dazzling lights of the huge, historic gates.[caption id=\"attachment_629\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Terrace overlooking the gates of Tiananmen Square - images courtesy of Capital M[/caption]The décor of Capital M is modern Chinese, with a touch of art deco. It is filled with curios and chinoiserie that make it feel exotic and exhilarating, and totally different from the very new hotel restaurants, or the very plain Chinese restaurants, all around Beijing.I have a long history with China, having originally visited Beijing in 1978 on the very first tour that Americans (who were not in the Government) could take. Among other things, there were no tall buildings, no cars, and no blondes (every time I went with another blonde friend into the street, masses of people crowded around us trying to pull our hair.)As everyone knows, China today is modern, efficient and increasingly cosmopolitan – but M on the Bund feels Asian and old-fashioned, exotic and romantic, all at the same time.So, after this overly-long prelude, how was the food? It was delicious, and certainly the best that I had tasted so far on my trip. Michelle and I shared three appetizers: caviar served with traditional eggs and onions, then duck charcuterie - which turned out to be duck pastrami, and duck terrine, and duck sausage, which were all lovely. Even better, however, was the crab soufflé in filo pastry with a lobster bisque sauce. Each was delicious, and a welcome change from Chinese dumplings.[caption id=\"attachment_630\" align=\"\" width=\"1293\"] The perfectly prepared roast suckling pig - images courtesy of Capital M[/caption]The mains were equally satisfying and inventive. In my opinion main courses are usually just fillers between ingenious and unusual appetizers and sinfully delicious desserts. In fact, the main course could often be skipped altogether. On this occasion, however, that was clearly not the case. We shared roast suckling pig, which was perfectly prepared and was served with grilled apples, roasted pumpkin and snap peas, an unusual and wonderful combination. Even better was the slow-cooked salt-encased leg of lamb with Swiss chard, roasted root vegetables and soft, smoky eggplant. The lamb was lovely, but the side dishes were even more delicious.When it came to dessert, I have to admit I skipped Michelle’s famous and gorgeous pavlova (because I have eaten it many times), but anyone going there must try it. So chose instead dark chocolate rocky road with vanilla and raspberry sorbet. The rocky road cake was rich chocolate filled with cherries, hazelnuts and marshmallows. Truly a child’s delight! It perfectly suited my childlike fascination for fabulous desserts, and I devoured the whole thing.Not only that, but I gratefully accepted Michelle’s offer to send me home with a lovely little box containing a second piece, so that I could eat it on the plane the next morning, as I was being picked up for my flight at 4.30am.The time had just flown by. Our dinner started at 8.00pm and ended at 11.00pm – only because I had a conference call to America at 11.30pm – so I had to leave all this wonderful food and my fabulous friend, but knowing that I would be able to return soon, as I have another Chinese business trip scheduled for late September.You can bet that the first thing I am going to do is book my table at Capital M – hopefully with Michelle herself, and certainly with my fellow directors, for whom I will be adding a bit of flavour to a very staid and serious series of meetings.Michelle is a star! She was in the eighties, and the passage of time has only made her and her food concept even better. I congratulated her over and over again on her very real success. Forgive me for gushing, but I love to see a woman entrepreneur doing so well in a field I love so much. The Chinese are lucky that she was so adventurous such a long time ago, and so are we.", "external_links": ["http://www.m-restaurantgroup.com/capitalm/home.html"], "published": "2015-08-26T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:39:08.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
