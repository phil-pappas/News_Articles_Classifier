Unless you’re a fan of Roald Dahl – which, let’s face it, all sensible people are – then grandparents in fiction are hard to come by. Roald Dahl with some of his adoring fans (Geoff Pugh) Considering how crucial grandparents are to many families, they are often missing from fiction. Nowadays, they are paying school fees and university fees , looking after children when parents are unable to , and providing much needed moral support for mums and dads countrywide. So why, in this age of double-generation parenting, are grandparents so often left out of fiction? In Harry Potter , one of the best-selling children’s book series of all time, no one has any visible grandparents. They are all so concerned with Harry not having any actual parents, that the previous generation are overlooked – not being central to the plot. JK Rowling made the decision to cut out grandparents from the books (Rex) In a story about family, Rowling makes the decision to shed the grandparents completely, focussing on the unbearable pain that Harry suffers in being without a set of parents. It is presumed that Harry has a set of deceased grandparents, as he goes to live with the Dursleys in the first instance, who are his aunt and uncle. The absence of grandparents provides the story with a focus: had they existed, the plot wouldn’t function. Dumbledore dies without issue (Warner Bros) Notwithstanding, the grandparents are absent time and again. Those old enough to be grandparents – Dumbledore , for one – don’t have issue. Indeed, Dumbledore never marries, despite his age, and though he takes on the role of guardian for Harry Potter, he is not a blood relation. The grandparents issue is skirted in the pursuit of getting other things sorted first, neglecting a whole chunk of the family dynamic, one that could be of significance. But not for Rowling. Grandpa Joe (far right) accompanies Charlie Bucket into the chocolate factory (Film Stills) Elsewhere, in Roald Dahl, grandparents step into the writer's room. In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , they are crucial to the story. Unlike in Harry Potter, there are four significant grandparents: Grandpa Joe, Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina - nattily named, presumably, so as to be amusing. Ned Donovan, Roald Dahl's grandson, explains that the draft version of Charlie and the Chocolate featured Mrs Bucket travelling with Charlie into Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. Grandpa Joe, her father, nearly didn’t get his day. But get it he did, and without him, Charlie Bucket would not have made it into the factory, nor had the support to ‘win’ the ultimate prize. In other fiction, the older generation are represented but not clearly defined as grandparental care-givers. Great Uncle Bulgaria in The Wombles (Rex) (Great) Uncle Bulgaria, in Elisabeth Beresford's The Wombles , full name Bulgaria Coburg Womble, is surely one of the most famous fictional members of the older generation. Appearing in a tartan hat, shawl, slippers and gold spectacles, he is one of the oldest womble, and, it is presumed, the wisest too. A little bit of maths is required to explain exactly how farcically old he is. The characters originally came to life in print in 1968, and then, Great Uncle Bulgaria recalls being “a young Womble” at the time of Queen Victoria ’s coronation in 1837. On publication, that would have made him at least 131, so for children reading him now, he’s getting on for more than 180. We never find out whether Great Uncle Bulgaria is actually anyone’s uncle, or whether he’s just one of those chaps that is called ‘Uncle’ because he’s friends with your parents, like your Auntie Caroline who lived next door to you as a child. One of the witches in The Witches portrayed by Quentin Blake Roald Dahl picks up grandparents again in The Witches , when a seven year old boy goes to live with his Norwegian grandmother after his parents are killed in a car crash. This grandmother is an excellent storyteller, and informs the unnamed boy, about the witches, that are “demons in human shape”. With the boy, the grandmother, who is also unnamed, outsmarts the English witches, and even The Grand High Witch. She is portrayed as a good grandmother – like the Bucket grandparents. In Roald Dahl, we might consider, the grandparents are good characters. They are not child-catchers, as in his screenplay of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , or evil like Aunts Spiker and Sponge Trotter in James and the Giant Peach . Unless you’re a fan of Roald Dahl – all sensible people are – then grandparents in fiction are hard to come by We are offered a further glimpse into the grandparent in fiction in Red Riding Hood , wherein the grandmother is consumed by the big bad wolf. Different versions of the story exist – some with the wolf eating up the grandmother, and others in which she is trapped in a cupboard. When a woodcutter, or hunter, depending on the version, arrives, he cuts open the sleeping wolf, whereupon the grandmother is able to emerge unharmed. It's not a great look for her, though, being eaten by a wolf. Wes Anderon's bonkers The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel did an excellent job of celebrating the older generation on the screen. But in fiction, the older generation with their grandchildren in tow, are no more than insignificant. This is the start of the campaign for more grandparents in fiction.
