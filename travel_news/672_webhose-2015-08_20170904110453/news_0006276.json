Jamie Hepburn, the Minister for Sport, Health Improvement and Mental Health, passed the bidding documents to 16-year-old ClubGolf graduate Katriona Taylor on Thursday and today, along with former Ladies European Tour player Catherine Panton-Lewis, the bid was submitted to the Ladies European Tour on behalf of Scotland.\nThis reflects Scotland’s commitment to legacy and the future of golf through the success of the innovative ClubGolf junior programme and also its history and prestige in the game with Bridge of Allan-born Panton-Lewis being a founder member of the Ladies European Tour.\nFirst Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, said:\n“Last year Scotland showed what it can do on the world-stage when it not only held, but significantly enhanced, some of the biggest events in the world of sport. The 2014 Ryder Cup was a magnificent spectacle and will be remembered for many years to come, while the XX Commonwealth Games was another huge success story for our country. We want to do the same thing with The Solheim Cup in 2019.\n“Scotland is now renowned as a world-class tourism and events destination. Not only would hosting The Solheim Cup in Scotland, the Home of Golf, provide a huge boost to the profile of this fantastic event, it would continue to promote equality across the game and show that golf in Scotland, where it began, is a sport for all after the successful hosting of The Ryder Cup.”\nFollowing a detailed selection process led by VisitScotland, and involving The Scottish Government, the Scottish Ladies Golf Association, Scottish Golf Union, Transport Scotland and current Scottish LET professionals, Gleneagles was identified as the ideal bidding partner for the event, given the world-renowned status of the venue and the outstanding success of The 2014 Ryder Cup.\nSource:- Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:45:24.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
