Europe's busiest train station, with some 700,000 people passing through every day, the Gare du Nord has recently been earmarked for a well-deserved makeover.\nInaugurated in 1864, there are nine statues crowning the rooftop facade, each representing destinations outside France, with the figure of Paris in the center.\nThere are 14 more modest statues lower down, representing French regional cities.\nWhere to go from here?\nThis is the Eurostar hub, connecting London (via Paris) with destinations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and France.\nReached by Metro lines 4 and 5; RER B connects with Charles de Gaulle Airport, Roissy.\nGood to know\nThe station has roles in \"Amelie\" (2001) and \"The Bourne Identity\" (2002).\nGare du Nord , Rue de Dunkerque, 75010 Paris France;\nGare Saint-Lazare\nIn the heart of Paris, steps away from Place de Madeleine, the Paris Opera and the city's grandest department stores, this is the capital's second busiest station.\nWhen it opened as a simple wooden structure in 1837 it was the first train station in Paris, but the terminus was soon expanded into its current form.\nThese days it's largely a commuter terminus, serving 450,000 passengers a day, but it was once the hub for glamorous ocean liner traffic arriving via Cherbourg.\nTravel-inspired artwork -- a teetering pile of bronze suitcases, a stack of clocks -- liven the main square in front of the entrance.\nAn enclosed walkway, La Galerie Marie Antoinette, connects the station with the old world splendor of the Hilton Paris Opera Hotel.\nWhere to go from here?\nGare Saint-Lazare serves the northwest of France. It can be reached by Metro lines 3, 12, 13, and 14.\nGood to know\nThe station has been featured in the work of impressionist painters Edouard Manet and Claude Monet.\nIn 1998 the Musee d'Orsay and National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., put on an exhibition called \"Manet, Monet, and the Gare Saint-Lazare.\"\nHilton Paris Opera , 108 Rue Saint-Lazare, 75008 Paris France;\nGare de l'Est\nA five-minute walk from Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est opened in 1849 to serve traffic to Strasbourg, in the east of France.\nIts main claim to fame is being home to the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, the privately run luxury travel experience that became a household name through Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express.\"\nConfusingly, there's more than one Orient Express: both traveled through Gare de l'Est, but the Venice-Simplon Orient Express is the one Christie wrote about.\nIt stops here on the way to Venice once a week, but the service to Istanbul has sadly been downgraded to once a year.\nYou'll know it by its royal blue carriages and upscale dress code (smart casual by day, black tie by night).\nThe Venice-Simplon Orient Express began in 1919, but the original Orient Express service, which connected Paris with Vienna from 1883 to 2009, was a regular overnight express train.\nWhere to go from here?\nEast: Sweeping from France's eastern cities Reims and Nancy, to Luxembourg, Germany, Poland and all the way to Moscow.\nReached by Metro lines 4, 5, and 7; the RER B from Gare du Nord (a short walk away) connects to Charles de Gaulle Airport, Roissy.\nGood to know\nBelow the station, underneath platforms 4 and 5, lies a secret miniature train set complete with station, tunnels and railway workers.\nThe Seine Saint-Denis Tourism board organizes occasional tours .\nVenice Simplon-Orient-Express: Day Trips , 4 Battle Bridge Lane Shackleton House, London SE1 2HP England;\nGare de Lyon\nFine dining is the call at Gare de Lyon's Le Train Bleu restaurant. Built for the World Exposition in 1900, this station is regarded as one of the finest examples of architecture of its era.\nIts clock tower is modeled after that of London's Houses of Parliament, home to the great bell of Big Ben.\nIt's probably the prettiest of Paris's stations.\nIt's also home to one of the city's most famous restaurants: Le Train Bleu.\nOpen since 1901, the decor has a grandeur to rival the palace of Versailles.\nPainted ceilings, gold leaf and shimmering chandeliers hint at the gilded prices on the menu.\nJust below is the Montreux Jazz Cafe, much cheaper and arguably more fun.\nBetween July and August this is one of Paris's busiest stations, with families complete with dogs, cats and even hamsters in carriers leaving the city to head south.\nWhere to go from here?\nThe south of France, southern Germany, Monaco, Switzerland, Italy, Spain.\nMetro lines 1 and 14; Air France bus to Charles de Gaulle Airport, Roissy.\nGood to know\nThe Gare d'Orsay was built at the same time as the Gare de Lyon, but unfortunately its platforms proved too short for the modern trains and it was closed in 1939.\nIt was later turned into the Musee d'Orsay.\nLe Train Bleu , Place Louis Armand Gare de Lyon, 75012 Paris France;\nNapoleon's legacy is intact at Gare d'Austerlitz. Gare d'Austerlitz\nOpened in 1840 as Gare d'Orleans, this station was eventually renamed Gare d'Austerlitz after one of France's greatest victories during the Battle of Austerlitz in the Napoleonic Wars.\nThe only operating station beside the Seine, Gare d'Austerlitz offers great views across the river, and is one of only two stations on the Rive Gauche, the left bank.\nOn the quayside, the turquoise metal entrance from the Metro bridge into the station offers a contrast to the old stone building, and features a statue representing the destination of Orleans.\nWhere to go from here?\nCentral and southern France, including Lyon, Grenoble, Nimes, Dijon, Toulon, and, of course, Orleans.\nReached by Metro lines 5 and 10.\nGood to know\nBy sad coincidence, during World War II Gare d'Austerlitz was the terminus from which children were evacuated into the countryside for safety, but it was also where thousands of Jews were carried off to internment camps.\nGare de Montparnasse\nLooking at the modern glass and steel facade of this station, you'd be hard pushed to believe it was originally opened in 1840 as Gare de l'Ouest.\nThe original building was torn down in 1969 to make way for the 59-story Tour Montparnasse, one of Paris's least loved buildings: in 2008, VirtualTourist.com voted it the second-ugliest building in the world.\nThe views from the top are said to be the best in Paris -- the popular joke being that it's the only spot from which the tower itself cannot be viewed.\nWhere to go from here?\nWestern and southwest France, from Brittany past Tours, Aquitaine, all the way to the Pyrenees and northern Spain.\nReached by Metro lines 4, 6, 12, and 13; Air France bus to Charles de Gaulle Airport, Roissy.\nGood to know\nIn 1885, the Granville-Paris Express overshot its stop when arriving at Gare Montparnasse and crashed through the terminal walls.\nIt's the subject of this iconic photograph showing the locomotive hanging above the pavement below.\nThere was one fatality: a female passerby who was killed by falling masonry.\nTour Montparnasse , 33 avenue du Maine, 75015 Paris France;\nGare de Bercy\nWithout doubt taking the crown as Paris' ugliest train station, Gare de Bercy (built in 1977) is also the smallest and the one located in the least glamorous area.\nIt still has its role to play, however.\nIt specializes in auto-trains, transporting passengers' vehicles to the south of France.\nWorking in conjunction with its neighboring station, travelers can drop their cars at Bercy to be taken to their chosen destination, while they take the passenger train from Gare de Lyon.\nWhere to go from here?\nLyon, Clermont-Ferrand, Dijon, Auxerre. Reached by metro lines 6 and 14.\nGood to know\nThis tiny train station is also a major hub for coaches connecting to the rest of Europe. You can get to Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, Switzerland and Italy from here.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-small-11.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d207718-Reviews-m14631-Hilton_Paris_Opera-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d1109767-Reviews-m14631-Le_Train_Bleu-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-small-169.jpg", "http://www.tourisme93.com/visites/1649-voies-ferrees-miniatures-sous-la-gare-de-l-est.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-small-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g186338-d500418-Reviews-m14631-Venice_Simplon_Orient_Express_Day_Trips-London_England.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-full-169.jpg", "https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/laccident-a-la-gare-montparnasse/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d314450-Reviews-m14631-Tour_Montparnasse-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-small-11.jpg", "http://parisbytrain.com/paris-rer/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120000-le-train-bleu-at-gare-de-lyon-paris-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d240639-Reviews-m14631-Gare_du_Nord-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150721120547-gare-dausterlitz-paris-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131015130106-gare-du-nord-paris-exlarge-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:27:33.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
