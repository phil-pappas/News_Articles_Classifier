He knows the gasoline prices, down to a penny, at every place on his driving route.\nIf it means driving a little out of the way, fine for Mockett. For some gas cheapskates, a 20-minute round-trip for a few pennies is OK, too.\nIt doesn’t matter if gas prices have come down in recent weeks and are expected to stay down, says Mockett.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time “Even if it doesn’t save me money, it encourages lower gas prices,” he says.\nIt’s the principle, you see.\nThe app GasBuddy , which lists gas prices everywhere, has been downloaded 50 million times, says the company.\nMockett is among those signed up. He’s also one of 14 million volunteer “spotters” who report gas prices to Gas Buddy. On the website, he uses the name, appropriately, “frugaltarian.”\nHe says, “What bothers me the most? People filling up across the street at 25 cents a gallon more.”\nSometimes that search for cheaper gas doesn’t quite work out.\nLike a year and a half ago, when Mockett’s family was driving to Sacramento, Calif., so their daughter could attend a rowing regatta.\nIt was 4 in the morning and they were cruising through Oregon.\nTime to fill up, but not at this exit.\nThe app showed that gas was 4 cents per gallon cheaper just 5 miles down the road. He pushed on.\nThe station was closed, and there is no self-serve in Oregon where you can use a credit or debit card if the place is closed.\nMockett had no choice but to keep going.\n“We were almost at Grants Pass. It’s a very long climb up the hill,” says Mockett. “I got to within 1,000 feet of the top when I ran out of gas. I had to back down the hill on the shoulder, back to the closed gas station. It ended up costing me $100 to have someone bring me 5 gallons of gas.”\nOK, so that’s a lesson.\nNot long ago, Mockett drove to Nebraska. He still used GasBuddy, but this time made sure the gas gauge never hovered near “E.”\nThe country is full of thrifty gas buyers like Mockett.\nHere is a figure: 63 percent of us would drive 5 minutes out of our way, each way, to pay 5 cents less a gallon. That’s not much savings — or even none at all — by the time you factor in the time and extra gas for the drive.\nThat’s from a survey by the Association for Convenience & Fuel Retailing. It represents all those minimart places that sell 80 percent of the country’s gas.\nHere’s another figure: 36 percent of us would drive 10 minutes out of our way to save 5 cents a gallon. A 20-minute round-trip.\nThe association points out that just to break even on that 20 minutes with a car that gets 30 miles per gallon, you’d have to buy at least 22 gallons of gas. Plus, there is the cost of 20 minutes of inconvenience.\nGas cheapskates fondly remember the times they really got a deal.\nOne month, Safeway, which offers “gas rewards” based on your purchases, had a sale on beef. Jeff Craig, 48, of Lake Stevens, a communications-repair technician, stocked up on plenty of meat for the freezer, and that month spent $1,000 at the store.\nThat got him $1 off per gallon of gas. Christmas!\nOne topic discussed among gas cheapskates is why prices can vary so much within a few blocks.\nPaul Mockett’s favorite station is the nondescript Union 76 Food Mart at the corner of California Avenue Southwest and Southwest Andover Street.\nOn a recent weekday, it was selling a gallon of regular for $2.99.\nA couple of blocks away, the 7-Eleven was at $3.21. A nearby Chevron was at $3.19. The Safeway was at $3.09, with 3 cents knocked off for members, and even more for frequent shoppers.\nThe pricing of gas has resulted in academic-research papers and attempts to explain it all in layman’s terms. It still all remains a mysterious realm.\nAs for whether branded gasoline is better than unbranded, and whether Top Tier Detergent Gasoline is worth the extra price, here is what Michael Green, AAA national spokesman, says:\n“For the driver interested in providing the best maintenance and care for their vehicle, maybe it’s worth for them to buy Top Tier gasoline (which have higher amounts of detergents and are touted as giving higher engine performance).\n“For the average driver, federal law requires all gasoline to have a minimum level of cleaning additives to combat intake valve and fuel injector deposits. These minimum standards are sufficient for many drivers. Most people have no problems, whatever gas they choose.”\nThe station that GasBuddy says consistently has the highest gas prices in the Seattle area is the Market Street Spirit Service in Ballard, at the corner of Northwest Market Street and 24th Avenue Northwest.\nOn a recent weekday, while the lowest prices hovered around $2.79 a gallon, that station was selling gas at $4.29.\nHarold Hezel, who’s owned the station since 1987, and runs a one-man car-repair shop, takes this bit of fame in stride.\n“Oh, yeah, I get a few people a week asking: ‘Why are you so much more?’ Then I explain, and they say, ‘That makes sense.’ ”\nHezel sells ethanol-free gas, a rarity these days.\nHis customers drive high-end, often older cars. You own a Rolls-Royce, you take care of it.\n“Ethanol deteriorates the rubber products, fuel hoses, supply lines,” says Hezel, besides getting poorer gas mileage.\nHe sells 4,500 gallons of his expensive gasoline a month, including to 15 to 20 “older customers” and “soccer moms” who don’t get out of the car and so pay an additional 50 cents a gallon for full service.\nBut for that they get the oil and tires checked, and a smile. The latter, for some, is probably especially worth it.\nErik Lacitis: 206-464-2237 or elacitis@seattletimes.com Twitter @ErikLacitis", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/ErikLacitis", "http://www.seattlegasprices.com/", "http://www.nacsonline.com/YourBusiness/FuelsReports/2015/Documents/2015-NACS-Fuels-Report_full.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-29T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:44:31.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
