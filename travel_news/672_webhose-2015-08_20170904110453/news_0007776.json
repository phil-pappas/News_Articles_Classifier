Updated 0822 GMT (1522 HKT) August 18, 2015 11 photos: 1. Melbourne, Australia – With great coffee, great food, lively music and arts scene and lots of open space, it's no surprise why Melbourne is rated the most liveable city in the annual Global Liveability Ranking by The Economist Intelligence Unit. Click through the gallery for the top five best and worst scoring cities on the list. Hide Caption 1 of 11 11 photos: 2. Vienna, Austria – Vienna is only 0.1 point short comparing to Melbourne in the index. Scoring 97.4 out of 100 -- the musical city with glamorous palaces and architecture came second again this year. Hide Caption 2 of 11 11 photos: 3. Vancouver, Canada – Once the title-holder of the liveability ranking until 2011, Vancouver remains the third most liveable city in the world. Hide Caption 3 of 11 11 photos: 4. Toronto, Canada – With perhaps Canada's top skyline -- including the 553-meter-high CN Tower -- Toronto came fourth in the survey. Hide Caption 4 of 11 11 photos: =5. Adelaide, Australia – With a score of 96.6, Adelaide doesn't only have parks, beaches and vineyards but also, for ghost story lovers, Australia's most terrifying tourist trails . Hide Caption 5 of 11 11 photos: =5. Calgary, Canada – One of the most underrated cities in Canada, Calgary upped its ranking from sixth to fifth this year, rounding off the top five liveable cities of 2015. Hide Caption 6 of 11 11 photos: 136. Tripoli, Libya – The beautiful alleyways in the Old City of Tripoli didn't help conflict-hit Libya's capital to have a better rating in the survey. With 40 points out of 100, Tripoli dropped from 132 in 2014 survey to the fifth least liveable city in 2015. Hide Caption 7 of 11 11 photos: 137. Lagos, Nigeria – Lagos is Nigeria's most populous city as well as its commercial capital. But overpopulation contributed to it being the fourth least liveable city in 2015. Hide Caption 8 of 11 11 photos: 138. Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea – The capital city of Papua New Guinea ranked 138 in the list, thanks largely to a high crime rate and an underdeveloped infrastructure. Hanuabada (pictured) is a stilt village sitting on the outskirts of Port Moresby. Hide Caption 9 of 11 11 photos: 139. Dhaka, Bangladesh – In a government report in 2011, traffic in Dhaka stood still for more than seven hours one day. Probably one of the reasons why the Bangladeshi capital is the second least liveable city in the world. Hide Caption 10 of 11 11 photos: 140. Damascus, Syria – War-torn Syria's capital, Damascus, is not only the least liveable city, it also recorded the biggest liveability score decline in the last five years -- a whopping 27-point-decrease. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Story highlights A surge in instability across the world over the past 12 months has seen liveability decline in some places Stable regions have witnessed terror attacks, growing civil unrest Chinese cities have bucked the trend, with a decline in civil disturbances Hong Kong (CNN) It's usually all about the top cities to live in when the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) publishes its annual Liveability Ranking -- but this year the picture is rather more gloomy. And that's because of a surge in global instability over the past 12 months, from terrorist shootings in France and Tunisia, to ongoing conflicts across the Middle East, Ukraine and Libya. In any event, it's as you were for the \"haves\" at the top of list, with Melbourne taking the top spot for a fifth year running, with Vienna, Vancouver, Toronto and Adelaide/Calgary (tied at 5) completing the \"top five most liveable cities\" in 2015. According to the EIU , these cities have \"relatively few challenges to living standards,\" and enjoy a good infrastructure, healthcare system and a low murder rate.
