But when plane debris from the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that vanished last year washed up on the shores of Réunion Island recently, Sarah Hugon-Manglou was determined to make the most of the moment. “We are a small island and all of the world is watching,” said Ms. Hugon-Manglou, the island’s irrepressible tourism representative. “We have this beautiful island and we want the world to see it.” La Réunion, as the locals call it, is a French department about 4,000 miles from Europe, off the southeastern coast of Africa, between the islands of Madagascar and Mauritius. If people had heard about it before, it was most likely because of bad publicity surrounding shark attacks or an epidemic of chikungunya , a disease spread by mosquitoes that affected about a quarter of the island’s 900,000 inhabitants in 2005 and 2006. AUG. 11, 2015 But there is much to see on this island, which is observing the fifth anniversary of its designation by Unesco as a World Heritage site. “We really have everything here,” Ms. Hugon-Manglou said. “Everything but snow.” The Piton de la Fournaise — meaning the peak of the furnace — is one of the most active volcanoes on the planet and has had around 125 recorded eruptions in the last century. It was recently in the midst of a spectacular eruption year and we set off in a helicopter early one afternoon to check it out. As we swooped over Grand Brûlé, the brown, barren landscape where lava flows harden into solid rock, and headed straight for the cones where lava was bursting into the sky, the helicopter felt at times as if it were on a marionette string, the wind having its way with the machine. It was a spectacular sight, even for islanders. Circling low over the exploding magma, we could feel the heat inside the helicopter. Our pilot, Rudy Clain from Corail Helicoptères , nodded out the window at the drama playing out below. When Réunion first rose from the sea, some two million years ago, there were three other volcanoes, which are now extinct. Their calderas have been transformed into lush landscapes populated by small communities that to this day are accessible only by foot or helicopter. As recently as the 1970s people were living there who had never seen the sea, according to local lore. One caldera, known as Cirque de Mafate, still looks like a place out of time — an Eden-like setting surrounded by majestic peaks and jagged hilltops. It is a full day’s trek from the coast, and visitors can spend the night in lodgings provided by villagers for around 25 euros (about $27 at $1.08 to the euro). \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story While the island, which is about half the size of Rhode Island, is unmistakably French, with chic boutiques and brasseries dotting the towns and cities along the coast, it is also distinctly of this place. Islanders come from Europe and the African mainland as well as China, India, Arabia, the Comoros and Madagascar islands. French is the official language but a form of Creole is also commonly spoken. American tourists are not common, and visitors should not expect English to be spoken outside the high-end hotels. The news of the airplane wreckage coincided not only with a volcanic eruption, but also with the Indian Ocean Island Games, a regional sporting contest that draws people from all the neighboring islands. Hotel rooms were hard to come by in the capital, St. Denis, which is not a big tourist draw. This was fortunate. The western side of the island has white-sand beaches that are far more appealing than the rocky shores where the plane wreckage was found. With rooms well over $400 a night, the area has an unmistakable Côte-d’Azur-on-the-Indian-Ocean vibe. Tourism on the island has been badly hurt in recent years by a spate of shark attacks. Authorities banned swimming and surfing on all but a few beaches that are either protected by coral reefs or netting. Since the shark attacks increased in 2011, the number of tourists fell to 405,700 from 471,300 in 2014, according to figures from the tourism department. One place on the island draws both surfers and sharks: the world-famous break at St. Leu. While getting in the water may not be safe, the view is fantastic, and so is the grilled swordfish at La Zat restaurant. From St. Leu, it is only a short ride to the fancy hotels and bars in St.-Gilles-Les-Bains, where a lagoon remains open for swimming. But it is the rugged interior that in many ways is the beating heart of the island, especially for those seeking a bit of adrenaline rush. And the best way for that is a canyoning expedition. We would set off shortly after dawn and be done before lunch. For the uninitiated, canyoning entails scaling canyon walls, jumping into deep pools of cold mountain water and floating through rapids to the next cliff to scale and leap from, into frigid waters below. Remi Wielgosik with Oasis Eaux Vives led a group through the gantlet in Bras Canot. When we were done, our wet suits stripped off and our heartbeats returning to normal, he offered a glass of rum fermented in fruit for six months, an island specialty. Having spent years taking his canoe on trips across Africa, he said he was always drawn back to Réunion. “There is no place in the world like this,” Mr. Wielgosik said.
