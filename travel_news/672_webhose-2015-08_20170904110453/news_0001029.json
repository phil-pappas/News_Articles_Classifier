I wanted to distill my story into a permanent form so that new people can open a door into my life.”\nHer voice in the book is a character she portrays — nerdy and offbeat, with lots of UPPERCASE WORDS and (parenthetical digressions). It reads not so much like it was written, but dictated.\nBut on the phone from Boston recently, Day was all business, talking about how the online world has evolved — and how she and other women have paid a high price trying to find their place in it.\nDay has been accused of getting where she has by using her sexuality, and some said she was responsible for the “downfall of gaming.”\nSo when game developer Zoe Quinn and vlogger Anita Sarkeesian were threatened and hacked in what’s become known as Gamergate, Day stayed silent.\n“I was afraid,” she wrote. Instead of speaking out, she erased anything from her online accounts that she didn’t want to go public. And she watched as Gamergate turned into “A perfect, hateful digital gumbo that gave the gaming world, and me, a black eye not soon to be healed.”\nDay finally wrote a Tumblr post called “ Crossing the Street ,” about avoiding two male gamers out of fear. Day mourned losing a community she loved.\nAlmost immediately after posting, Day was doxxed — personal information such as her address and phone number were posted online. That led to people sending her certified letters that said, “I know where you live” and phone calls from strange area codes in the middle of the night. She was even afraid to walk her dog.\n“It’s scary,” she said. “There needs to be consequences for the actions of people. There needs to be a concerted effort when people are being attacked. It’s incumbent upon law enforcement and the platforms to warn people that there are consequences for their actions.”\nSome platforms have been better about enforcement, Day said, and leaders in the gaming world are finally speaking out.\n“As the landscape evolves, it will get better,” she said.\nRELATED STORY: ‘This has got to change': Women game developers fight sexism in industry\nSo what is the rap against women in gaming?\n“For some reason, gamers feel very possessive,” she explained. “People who immerse themselves in worlds feel a strong sense of ownership. I even feel an extra investment in those worlds.\n“And if you’re anonymous, it allows you to be yourself, but it also allows you to be the worst of yourself.”\nIt’s ironic, she said, because gaming is a culture where people who have long felt like outsiders feel included.\n“But now it’s growing,” Day went on. “And people resist that change.”\n Related video: Women and video games Since the mid-1980s, the video-game industry has often been an inhospitable place for women. But as gamer demographics shift, some are working to change that from the inside. Read more . (Lindsey Wasson & Lauren Frohne / The Seattle Times) Day attended the University of Texas in Austin, where she studied violin and math. Despite her accomplishments (she graduated with a 4.0), Day moved to Hollywood to pursue acting.\n“It was always a thread in my life,” she said. “That sense of play that I found coming from a home-schooled environment led me to Hollywood.”\nShe considered becoming a professional musician, “but it was never something that I found meaning in. The only sense of meaning that I had found was performing.”\nDay was only “checking the box of getting a real degree for other people,” she said. “That gave me the freedom to go to Hollywood and do something for myself.”\nShe made a living doing commercials for products like Cheetos and Diet Coke . She wanted to write a screenplay, and followed the adage, “Write what you know.” That led to “The Guild,” a Web series she wrote, based on her experiences as a World of Warcraft player.\nDay promoted the show any way she could, and it gained a following, and was the seed of what would become Geek & Sundry, a digital network that claims 1.4 million subscribers to its YouTube channel.\nA year ago, Day sold Geek & Sundry to Legendary Entertainment, and is developing scripted and nonscripted TV projects and digital series with them. The most recent is “Spooked.”\nDay is encouraged to see more women who love playing and creating games, and in her book she is quick to urge them to forge ahead with their ideas.\n“I want people to read the book and take the small step of doing something they may not be brave enough to try,” she said. “Creativity is something that is inherent and it takes a lot of bravery to finish something and put it out there.\n“But in the digital world, it’s so easy, it’s the world we live in,” she said. “It’s about being creative, and not so much about the platform anymore.”", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-V8wd_aGPI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgkAhu_mKYg", "http://feliciaday.com/blog/crossing-the-street/"], "published": "2015-08-21T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:28:24.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
