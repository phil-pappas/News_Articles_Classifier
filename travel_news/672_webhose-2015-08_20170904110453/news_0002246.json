Each year, students participate in hands-on, full-immersion workshops related to a variety of career paths, ranging from animation to zoology. Each participant learns important skills such as communication techniques, leadership values and networking strategies. \nIt all takes place in the very magical and creative setting of Walt Disney World Resort. Dreamers are taken both on stage and behind the scenes, where Disney theme parks become vibrant 'classrooms,' leading to career discoveries, the pursuit of dreams and fun memories to cherish for a lifetime. \nDisney Dreamers are exposed to motivational speakers and celebrities who share their stories and provide insight on how to achieve success and DREAM BIG. Dreamers have the opportunity to cultivate relationships with other students from across the nation while they gain first-hand knowledge from Disney experts and world-renowned entrepreneurs and executives. \n\"We're excited to welcome back Disney Dreamers Academy with Steve Harvey and ESSENCE for the ninth year,\" said Tracey D. Powell, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts vice president of deluxe resorts and Disney Dreamers Academy executive champion. \"This program stands out for its ability to motivate and inspire teens to think big and achieve their dreams. By applying for Disney Dreamers Academy, high school students from across the country are taking a step toward an experience that can change their lives.\" \nApplicants must answer essay questions about their personal stories and their dreams for the future. Students are selected based on a combination of attributes, including a strong character, positive attitude and determination to achieve their dreams. \nSelect Disney Dreamers along with a parent or guardian, will receive an all-expense-paid trip to Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where they will participate in life-changing sessions as they are surrounded by the creativity and innovation represented in Disney theme parks around the world. Disney Dreamers Academy will take place March 3-6, 2016. \nSteve Harvey, syndicated radio and television personality, along with ESSENCE and Walt Disney World Resort will host the selected Dreamers during their four-day power packed career and educational exploration. \"One of my personal commitments is to always give back and particularly to youth,\" said Harvey. \"We've seen 800 students come through the program, and I'm excited to find the next 100. I encourage all high school students to take the time to apply for Disney Dreamers Academy because I truly believe that a young person's dream is more important than anything.\" \nESSENCE Communications President Michelle Ebanks added, \"Each year, ESSENCE is honored to seek out the next generation of big dreamers and welcome them to Walt Disney World Resort for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
