So we’re targeting a different guest, someone who’s younger, design conscious and wants to stay in an iconic property.” \n\nAkyra Manor, which also has meetings facilities, will focus on its F&B offerings, including the poolside/rooftop Rice Bar, to attract customers in a city with a burgeoning café culture but lacks high-concept branded venues. \n\nManor Group recently opened Italics restaurant in Bangkok, a joint venture with Akaryn, and plans to develop another property in Chiang Mai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:03:50.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
