The acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing in its first full year of ownership. \nThe reputation of the Baines Simmons brand and the expertise of its employees within the aviation sector are key elements which should enable the business to help shape the evolving safety requirements in the industry and in particular, the sub-sectors of aviation regulation, compliance and safety management performance. Baines Simmons will provide Air Partner with the opportunity to extend the Group’s service and product capabilities which will complement and enhance its existing broking business. \nFounded in 2001, Baines Simmons is a trusted consultant and advisor to more than 750 aviation organisations and more than 40 aviation authorities and has helped develop the skills and expertise of more than 120,000 aviation professionals.

Baines Simmons will continue to be the brand and organisation under which operations specifically within the aviation regulation, compliance and safety management performance sectors will be undertaken. As an Air Partner company, Baines Simmons can immediately benefit from the leverage and reach that Air Partner’s global office infrastructure and supplier network already provides for the Group’s other leading aviation services brands, Air Partner, Cabot Aviation and JetCard. \nFollowing acquisition, Baines Simmons will continue to be managed by its current executive team led by Managing Director, Andrew Parker and founders, Keven Baines and Bob Simmons and will remain headquartered at Fairoaks Airport in Surrey. \nBaines Simmons operates through three highly complementary practice areas: \nConsulting Baines Simmons assist clients to improve business performance by de-risking complex organisations, ensuring that high safety performance standards, covering people, processes, systems and mind-set, are an integral part of an organisation’s approach to business.

Since launch in May 2007, over 800 aircraft have registered, and Baines Simmons’ airworthiness surveyors have completed in excess of 2,200 aircraft surveys, recommending Certificate of Airworthiness for issue, renewal or export. The Registry is the fastest growing aircraft registry in the world and has a reputation for award-winning levels of customer service and the highest standards of independent regulatory oversight. \nBaines Simmons has developed a range of industry-leading proprietary IP, enabling it to play a leading role at the forefront of the aviation regulatory authorities’ drive to transform the industry’s approach, beyond prescriptive compliance to proactive performance-based regulation.

The total net consideration for the acquisition is up to £6.0m, and is comprised of a £5.4m cash payment paid on completion and a Deferred Consideration of up to £0.6m payable in January 2018 dependent on performance criteria. The acquisition has been funded from a combination of the Group’s existing cash resources as well as a £3.6m debt facility provided by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
