With the economy starting to move in the right direction the hospitality industry is thriving and the future is looking bright, however research from Caterer.com and Purple Cubed found that a third of hospitality employees are ready to leave their employer right now. \nIt showed that salary wasn’t the key factor in driving this decision and that to ensure retention, employers must be aware of the main influences; inspiring leadership, open communication, opportunities to develop and a clear career path. The Retention award aims to showcase businesses that use innovative and tailored methods to increase retention rates. Retention Award 2014 winner Boodles showed the importance of retaining staff in their entry through ensuring staff felt valued and that their Management and Committee team were dedicated to staff welfare which led to great staff loyalty and increased length of service. Commenting, Springboard CEO, Anne Pierce MBE said: “Retaining staff in this ever changing industry can be a tough job to do, which is why Springboard wants to reward organisations who successfully and effectively do this. For this award judges will be seeking evidence that labour turnover has been consistently low or has improved as a result of specific initiatives to address retention. This year, Springboard is excited to partner with Perkbox to promote retention in the hospitality industry.” Saurav Chopra, co-founder and CEO of Perkbox comments: \"The sector, while lively and rewarding, is traditionally mired by high staff turnover rates, so our partnership with Springboard will help educate businesses operating in these fields to improve their work culture and nurture a driven and happy team who are compelled to stay and invest in their future. \"Sponsoring Springboard’s Retention Award enables us to unite with this great charity and champion forward thinking businesses who put their employees’ happiness first. The Retention Awards gives recognition and prestige to businesses who excel in this, and we’re truly delighted to be supporting that.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:20:53.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
