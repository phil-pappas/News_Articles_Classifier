(Brian Kelly/bkelly@al.com) B.Kelly \nSo, you've just arrived at your swanky condo for a nice long weekend at Alabama's Gulf Coast. You got maw maw to babysit for Friday night and you and your partner are just itching to see what the Orange Beach, Ala. nightlife holds. Well, you could head east to the Flora-Bama (always a good option) or find a little beach bar watering hole and down some raw oysters and a draft beer or two while listening to a bar band. Sights and Sounds of Our Cigar Bar with Ed Lee, Orange Beach, 8.7.15 Check out the sights and sounds of Our Cigar Bar at The Wharf in Orange Beach, Ala. featuring pianist Ed Lee, who talks about the one-man show he puts on every weekend. (Brian Kelly/bkelly@al.com) \nOr sport some lounge lizard threads and hit one of the island's hottest spots of late -- Our Cigar Bar at The Wharf in Orange Beach. This hip cigar bar isn't your typical Pleasure Island juke joint by the backbays. Owner Tony King along with his wife Connie have created a night spot like nothing else at the beach. Recently, the couple took ownership of the bar -- and it's been a hit with locals and tourists alike. \n\"I mean, when there's a concert at the Amphitheater it's standing room only before and after the show,\" Tony said. \"We wanted to create something that's like nothing else in Orange Beach. You know, you can smoke here and we get a lot of folks that like a good cigar. But overall we created a comfortable lounge with some great live music. It's going great so far.\" \nThe live music Tony speaks of is courtesy of Ed Lee, the only musician OCB books. And what a show the veteran pianist-vocalist puts on. Part cabaret, part stand-up comedy show, part Karaoke, Lee belts out classic ballads and party songs all night long. It's a brand of one-man show on the Steinway he was born to do. To see Lee in action, watch the video in this post. \n\"People hear me singing from the street and they just feel like they have to come in and see me,\" Lee said. \"I think people like this style of live music because they can sing along and I do very recognizable songs. Plus they can request anything and I'll probably know it. So what I do appeals to a lot of people who just want to relax without the loud sound of a live band.\" \nRecently, Lee was entertaining about 50 people at the bar. Among them was Rachel Cooke of Louisiana who was swaying and cheering with a group of friends. \"You find this in New Orleans but not someplace like Orange Beach,\" Cooke said. \"So, when we came upon Ed we were really excited. It's refreshing over a cover band.\" \nSure, OCB is allows smoking so it's not for everyone, but King has thought of even that. \"We really wanted to keep the smoke down so I went with a state-of-the-art filter system. You walk in here and you don't see a cloud of smoke hanging over the bar. It's pretty good.\" \nLee and OCB are a fairly recent addition to the nightlife landscape that is Orange Beach, but it's one worth checking out if for nothing else than to watch Lee do what do does better than anyone at the beach. Make you want to sing along with him. \nOCB is located along Main Street at The Wharf in Orange Beach. Over 21 only. Lee performs from 8 to 1 a.m. each Friday and Saturday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:08:01.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
