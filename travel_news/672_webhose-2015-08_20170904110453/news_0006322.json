We are not there to simply go surf, brag about it and then bail.” \nThe expedition, scheduled for September, has been approved by the North Korean government, which is eager to boost its small but developing tourism sector. \nAndrea Lee, CEO of Uri Tours", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:14:36.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
