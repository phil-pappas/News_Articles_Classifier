Police say James A. Young had just finished riding the Raptor on Thursday and jumped over a fence to retrieve something he dropped during the 57 mph ride. The Erie County coroner says it was his cellphone. Sandusky police say Young was struck by the ride or someone on it. No one else was hurt. The amusement park sits along Lake Erie in Sandusky and has billed itself as the best in the world. The park confirms the death in a statement saying \"a guest entered a restricted, fenced area of Raptor and was struck by the ride.\" It says its \"thoughts and prayers go out to the family.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:48:44.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
