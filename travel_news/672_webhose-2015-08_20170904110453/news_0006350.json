We're so easily amazed by the new and shiny that we don't seem to care about passion-driven projects. \nBatcat Toy Museum is what we wish we could have made out of our fascinations. It's a private museum that came about when a local toy collector decided that his lot — especially his Batman paraphernalia — was worth sharing with the public. \nThere are two zones in the museum. The first is the \"movie toys\" zone, which accounts for 30 per cent of the entire vault and makes the museum enjoyable even if you're not a fan of DC or Marvel. The owner collects just about every cartoon imaginable — a lifesized Simpsons family visitors can pretend to be the sixth member of, for instance. Star Wars, Super Mario, Transformers, Ultraman, One Piece and Disney are just a few of other franchises represented in this zone. You'll even find a substantial Minions display for all you Despicable Me fans. \nThe other zone contains a 50,000-piece Batman collection. You'll find rare collectibles that date back to the '60s, as well as those as recent as Heath Ledger's version of the Joker. One of the largest items is the full-sized Batmobile model the owner had custom-made, but it's the small, intricate pieces in the collection that really draw the eye — and will keep you coming back for more. \nThe best part about the museum is that taking photographs is absolutely allowed. When you're done touring, you can purchase merchandise at the atrium and have a snack or drink at the cafe. \nThe Batcat museum is located near the intersection of Ramkhamhaeng and Srinagarindra roads. The museum is open daily, from 10am to 5pm. Admission is 100 baht for adults and 60 baht for children (250/150 baht for foreign adults and children; free for Muse Pass holders).
