Your friends might tell you that the only way to see Italy is by car, but I guarantee you won't be bored with the places you can see by train over a month's period. The Turin to Venice route in itself passes through many compelling cities, including Milan, Brescia, Verona, and Padua to name a few. \nUse the Italy rail map below to plan your Italian Vacation. It shows the major Italian Cities and the rail lines connecting them. \nThe lines in purple are used for the high-speed trains like Eurostar Italia and the IC (Intercity) trains. The orange lines are only suitable for slower trains.

You can see timetables, get special offers and \"Hot-News\" as well as information on trains and ships.If you are planning a European trip by train, you might consult the German DB Bahn site, acknowledged by travelers as having the most comprehensive rail information for Europe. Italian Rail Passes and Ticketing \nIn general, train travel in Italy is less expensive than other countries in Europe. Most seasoned travelers just buy point to point rail tickets. You would have to travel a long way each of your four travel days to make the Italy Rail Pass ( purchase or get information ) a worthwhile investment. Still, if you don't speak Italian, you may opt for the convenience of a rail pass. A better deal for travelers going to France and Italy might be the combo pass ( purchase or get information ). Remember, with these passes you'll have to use your pass travel days for longer journeys to make the rail pass worth the cost (See: Is a Rail Pass Guaranteed to Save You Money? ) \nWhen I'm in Italy, I simply buy my tickets at the ticket window at the station. There are also kiosks where you can buy local tickets through a machine. These work very well. \nMore confusing is ticketing on the fast trains like the Eurostar Italia, where you'll also need to purchase an obligatory seat reservation. Some travelers like to have the tickets for these trains in their pockets before they leave for their vacation without having to deal with a ticket agent who only speaks Italian. A hassle-free way of doing this is through Select Italy , where you can check schedules and buy tickets with automatic seat reservations direct. \nThe new kid on the block is Italo, the independent high speed rail network that gets you between major cities quickly, traveling at up to 360km/h. Rome to Florence will take you a bit less than an hour and a half on Italo Trains: Learn more or buy a ticket direct .
