By Cindy Decker Dispatch • Sunday August 16, 2015 9:29 AM Alex Goetz | Toledo Zoo Wakil is the Toledo Zoo’s new baby orangutan, born July 23. \nSome friends and I were grousing the other day about feeling cheated out of summer this year. \nCentral Ohio’s wet June kept us indoors often, and some children in the area started school last week. \nWith our playtime cut short, some people might be feeling shorted on summer travel, too. Late summer or fall could be the time to make up for it, given the inviting weather to be found throughout much of the country during this time of year. \nThe AAA Auto Club travel department reports that central Ohioans are planning such trips — to Chicago; upstate New York and the Niagara Falls area; and to the Smoky Mountains and Gatlinburg, Tenn. \n“We are also still seeing people traveling close to home for weekend getaways,” Kimberly Schwind, AAA senior public-relations manager, said in an email message. “Hocking Hills is a very popular close-to-home fall travel destination.” \nFor other travelers seeking season-extenders, here’s a sampling of ideas fairly close to home: \n• Children will be all but guaranteed to catch a fish at Lake Loramie State Park during a catfish derby from 9 a.m. to noon Sept. 5. \nBefore the event, the Ohio Division of Wildlife plans to stock a channel of the western Ohio lake with catfish. Wildlife employees will be on hand with extra poles for children who need them, along with a limited supply of bait. \nThe free derby is open to kids 17 and younger (but participants need a current fishing license). \nAfter the event, you can explore the lake — which had been a feeder for Ohio’s canal system — or swim at the sandy beach. \nFor more information, visit parks.ohiodnr.gov/lakeloramie \n• A baby orangutan is delighting visitors to the Toledo Zoo. The red-haired male, Wakil, was born on July 23 to mother Yaz, 37, and father Boomer, 25. \nThe new arrival’s name is an Indonesian word meaning spokesperson — fitting for the offspring of a species endangered by man. \nWhile at the zoo, you should check out its new aquarium, which includes more than 3,000 creatures in 178,000 gallons of water. \nFor more information about the zoo, call 419-385-4040 or visit www.toledozoo.org \n\n• The Newport Aquarium in Kentucky is offering a new thrill to visitors: the Shark Bridge. \nVisitors can cross the open-air shark tank on a rope suspension bridge just inches above the two dozen sharks below. \nFor more information, call 1-800-406-3474 or visit www.newportaquarium.com \n\n• Back in 1969, the Cuyahoga River caught fire — one of the more infamous moments in Ohio history. \nThe event will be marked Aug. 28 and 29 in the Burning River Fest, set for the Coast Guard station on Whiskey Island in Cleveland. \nThe event will include music on two stages, including an appearance by Brian Johnson of The Voice ; food made from local products; cooking demonstrations; and beer from Great Lakes Brewing. \nProceeds will help renovate the Coast Guard station.
