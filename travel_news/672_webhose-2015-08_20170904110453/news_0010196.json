Drug wars. Chaos and despair. Life in these countries hasn’t always been easy, but now they have transformed into tourist meccas. So how did it happen? Travel Advice Airline pilots describe their near-disasters on Reddit, and their passengers had no idea by: Scary truth ... Behind the cockpit doors, things can go a little awry. Source: ThinkStock \nFLYING is, in a sense, an act of blind faith. \nWhen you board a plane, you are granting your complete trust to your pilot and airline. \nThere have been many tragedies in the sky in recent years, from the Germanwings’ mass-murder suicide to MH370’s disappearance and the AirAsia QZ8501 crash . And even more recently, Saturday’s deadly explosion in Shoreham . But despite the heartbreak we feel, we still need to travel. So we pack our bags, assure ourselves “not this time”, turn the other cheek and trust that our pilot will get us safely from point A to point B. Shoreham crash ... The Hawker Hunter jet ploughed into a busy road during an airshow. Source: YouTube \nBut it appears the scary truth is, while we munched on our reheated stewed beef and went square-eyed over our tiny screens, there could have been so many more accidents. \nIn a stomach-churning discussion on Reddit , pilots have revealed just how close they have come, sometimes mere seconds, from disaster — and their passengers didn’t have a clue. \nSo from serious engine failure to nauseatingly low air pressure levels and quick-thinking pilots being forced to concoct makeshift oven mitts to touch hot controllers, this is our pick of the bunch. \nNote: if you have a fear of flying, this isn’t for you. \nWHAT’S YOUR SCARIEST TRAVEL EXPERIENCE? Tell us below. A near miss \nOne poster explained how their father, a former captain for Eastern Airlines, had just about reached take-off speeds when another jet taxied across the runway. By this stage, his plane was going too fast to stop, so he had to lift off early. He managed to clear the other plane by what felt like a whisker. But his passengers? They had no idea. Keeping cool ... Pilots need to be ready for anything. Source: ThinkStock ‘All the passengers noticed were their ears popping’ \nOne commercial airline captain, flying an Embraer 175, described how the cabin pressure control channels failed on one occasion, causing a rapid loss of cabin air pressure — putting everyone’s consciousness at risk, including their own. When you are flying at 30,000 feet, you only have about 30 seconds before you start slipping. The pilot had to urgently start a steep emergency descent, at which point they flipped the pressurisation switch to manual, then back to automatic, which got it to the working channel. “Pretty sure all the passengers noticed were their ears popping,” they said. “It gave us about 80 seconds of a scare though.” This pilot saved the day in not one, but two, sticky situations \nA vintage biplane pilot, who took people on aerobatic rides, grappled with a number of problems. On one occasion, the engine exploded mid-flight forcing them to land in a field. But because they stayed calm and their passenger was foreign and unable to understand what was being said on the radio, it was just assumed that landing in a field was standard practice. Another time, there was a tyre blowout as the plane landed on its grass runway. This meant the plane stopped in about 50m instead of the usual 200m. But the passenger had no idea there was a problem until fire crews were called in to help push the aircraft back. “Most of the time, the passenger doesn’t know what normal is, so it’s no different for them when things go awry, assuming you get a safe landing out of it,” they said. Ready for takeoff? ... Our feelings exactly. Source: ThinkStock This air traffic controller faced a very dicey situation \nAn air traffic controller explained how they lost contact with a pilot, which can happen when they are on the wrong frequency or the radios go berzerk. The poster said it wasn’t uncommon, and it was usually easily rectified. But on this particular occasion, the drop-out happened at the worst possible moment. The pilot unknowingly ended up cruising on the wrong altitude when his flight plan actually had him on another. There were now about dozen planes in his path, coming head-on. “He ended up running one heck of a gauntlet through all these people as I was descending and climbing them to get them out of his way,” they wrote — and they were relieved nothing worse happened. That was until the pilot suddenly decided to change altitude, perhaps knowing instinctively he should have by now. Meaning all at once, all those planes that had moved out of his way were right back in his path. Now that’s the kind of stress nobody needs. Air disaster ... Tragically, it seems some disasters can’t be helped. Source: AFP ‘They couldn’t touch the controls, they were using clothing as oven mitts’ \nOne poster said their father retired as a pilot with 36,000 hours of flying — but not before facing an exceedingly nerve-racking moment. Taking off for a flight from Orlando to Boston in the US, he noticed there was abnormal amounts of hot air flushing into the cockpit. It appeared the mechanics on the ground hadn’t wired the engine valve shut like they were meant to. Instead, it was left wide open, with the maximum amount of hot air pouring straight in. He had to make an emergency landing in Jacksonville, but not before enduring a lot of discomfort. Unable to touch the controls because they had heated up so much, he and his co-pilot had to create makeshift oven mitts out of their clothes so they could steer the plane. By the time they hit the ground, they were totally drenched in their own sweat. \nSo why are passengers so often left in the dark in these incidents ? It seems it’s for our own benefit and peace of mind. \n“Airline pilot here. Most of us would rather not saying anything about emergencies while in flight. However when it comes to a near disaster occurring, almost never,” reads one post. \nBut of course, it wasn’t all doom and gloom in the discussion. One pilot piped up, saying “in seven years and 6000 hours of commercial flying, nothing close to a disaster has ever happened”. To which he got the response: “now let’s all upvote this and get back to our lives which already contain enough fear.” Werd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T10:07:05.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
