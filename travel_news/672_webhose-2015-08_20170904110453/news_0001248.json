Requires iOS8 or later.\n>> Cost: Free\n>> What it does: It’s an app that imports your iOS videos, allows you to edit, personalize and add music, and then share them on popular social platforms.\n>> What’s hot: I’m daunted by other video-editing apps, but I was enamored with Cameo’s latest because of its lightning-quick video import tool. My videos quickly loaded, and I could easily change their order to craft my travel movie. There also was some hip music I could choose and use — for free — to accompany my video. Love filters? Cameo offers choices, called “themes,” too. Need inspiration? I found some sample videos by scrolling down on the Vimeo.com/cameo website. There’s also a “Best of Cameo” channel on the Vimeo blog too.\n>> What’s not: Some fans of Cameo’s original app say they miss the social element that is gone with this version. That didn’t bother me because I’m new to video editing, but I would love to see more font choices and more options for placing titles and captions on the screen. I’d even pay for that upgrade.\nJen Leo, Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T01:50:55.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
