It uses sales and tax revenue data, employment figures and other industry and economic numbers to gauge the overall impact of visitor spending across the state.\n“The youth soccer, swimming, baseball and softball tournaments held at Shelby City Park bring a lot of visitors to our area,” Sibley-Newton said. “The American Legion World Series and events surrounding the games speaks for itself in regards to the thousands of people and media attention it brings to our community.”\nThe Economic Impact of the 2015 American Legion World Series is estimated at $9.6 million, she said.\n“The commercial spots run on ESPN were worth thousands of dollars in advertising and is expected to increase tourism to our area significantly,” Sibley-Newton added. “I predict a six to 10 percent increase in visitor spending next year as a result of this additional advertising joined with the marketing and advertising campaign already taking place.”\nSibley-Newton also highlighted events at Gardner-Webb University and the Liberty Mountain Drama in Kings Mountain as playing a part in bringing visitors to the county.\n“People really like visiting our county and return often once they discover all the things there are to see and do here,” Sibley-Newton said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:07:16.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
