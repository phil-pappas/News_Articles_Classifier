New routes and flights are now available for travel.\nThe expanded agreement provides new code-share routes from New York (JFK) to and from United States mainland destinations Albuquerque (ABQ), Daytona Beach (DAB), Reno (RNO) and Savannah (SAV), along with two Puerto Rican destinations, Aguadilla (BQN) and Ponce (PSE).“We are pleased to deepen our partnership with JetBlue and to give our world travellers superior access to destinations in the United States, through a seamless passenger experience. The strengthening of this code-share agreement comes at a time when Qatar Airways is focused upon significantly expanding its own direct links to the United States, with the launch of non-stop services to Los Angeles, Atlanta and Boston in 2016,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker.\nIn addition to the new destinations, the partnership will increase the number of codeshare flights along existing routes to Buffalo (BUF), Burlington (BTV), Charleston (CHS), Fort Lauderdale (FLL), Fort Myers (RSW), Jacksonville (JAX), New Orleans (MSY), Oakland (OAK), Portland (PWM), Rochester (ROC), Syracuse (SYR) and Tampa (TPA).\nThe expanded agreement will also include connections to and from Qatar Airways’ second daily Doha to New York flight beginning 1st March 2016. The second daily service will be operated by the airline’s latest flagship Airbus A350 XWB aircraft, of which Qatar Airways was the Global Launch Customer.\nThis new state-of-the-art aircraft is ergonomically designed to reduce jetlag, aid in relaxation, and increase space and comfort with an extra-wide cabin, high ceilings and panoramic windows. It is also one of the lightest aircraft of its type, made from advanced composite materials, which emits 25% lower carbon dioxide emissions than with current generation aircraft in its category.\nSource:- Qatar Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:06:41.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
