That makes them an ideal choice for diverse public works fleets. At the upcoming APWA International Public Works Congress & Exposition , fleet operators can see how to use Mach Series lifts and jack stands to get the most out of their service bays. Rotary Lift will be in booth #1259 at the event, which runs Aug. 30 – Sept. 2 at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150814/258489\n\"Public works fleets are incredibly diverse, with everything from basic service and utility vehicles to large road construction and snow removal trucks,\" says Doug Spiller , heavy-duty product manager for Rotary Lift. \"Mach Series mobile column lifts can pick up any of those vehicles by the wheels. For wheels-free work, the technician can simply lower the vehicle onto jack stands. As a result, fleet managers don't have to dedicate certain lifts to specific jobs or vehicle types. This simplifies the lift-buying process and streamlines operations.\"\nMach Series mobile column lifts are battery-operated and available with capacities of 13,000 lbs. or 18,000 lbs. per column. They can be ordered in sets of two, four, six or eight columns, so customers can select the right amount of capacity for the vehicles they service. The Mach Series lift on display at the APWA Expo will be equipped with Rotary Lift's wireless communications option (lift model MCHW418), which eliminates bulky communications cables. This provides a completely clear floor under and around the vehicle.\nRotary Lift's APWA Expo Booth will also include an 18,000 lb. capacity jack stand (model RS18YL) designed for heavy-duty vehicles. The tripod stand comes with spring-loaded casters for easy transport and positioning, and has a height range of 56 inches to 82.25 inches. In addition to wheels-free work, Rotary Lift's heavy-duty jack stands enable the vehicle to remain in the air for service while the mobile columns are removed and used elsewhere in the shop.\nTo learn more about Mach Series mobile column lifts, heavy-duty jack stands and the full line of heavy-duty Rotary Lift products, stop by Rotary Lift booth #1259 at the APWA Expo, contact your local Rotary Lift distributor, visit www.rotarylift.com/Heavy-Duty-Lifts or call 800-640-5438.
