(Allen Eyestone / The Palm Beach Post) “It was good to have him out in pads — for him, for the team,” coach Joe Philbin said. “We’re just taking it a day at a time and see when we can add more to his plate and go from there.”\nWithout Albert, Jason Fox has taken reps at left tackle, which is significant. Last season, first-round pick Ja’Wuan James shifted from right tackle to left after Albert was injured against the Lions on Nov. 9, enabling him to protect quarterback Ryan Tannehill’s blind side. If the Dolphins thought Albert wouldn’t be ready for the regular season, they likely would have James practicing again at left tackle.\nPick-six time: Ryan Tannehill threw what was believed to be his first interception of camp, a 98-yard pick-six by Reshad Jones, who stepped in front of Damien Williams and frolicked toward the end zone while flashing the ball in Tannehill’s direction.\nJones pointed out that he stopped after about 70 yards since the touchdown was a formality and he wanted to be a nice guy.\n“I didn’t want to make him feel bad the whole play,” Jones said.\nWill Davis, easing his way back from knee surgery, intercepted Matt Moore on the next play as the red zone defense flexed its muscle.\n“A couple of years ago, we were like top three in red zone defense,” Jones said. “That’s one of the things that we want to pride ourselves on, getting back to that area.”\nDavis came back strong after taking Saturday off.\n“It’s just that thing of pushing my knee as much as I can, but at the same time taking care of it as much as I can,” Davis said. “I know the process, as far as getting it back 100 (percent). It’s a process and a day-by-day thing. I’m not going to just come out here and be the Willie D I was. It’s more in my mind, trying to go through that process.”\nJamar Taylor appears to be leading the competition to start at cornerback opposite Brent Grimes, but there’s plenty of time.\n“I’ve always believed that you can finish everything by the time you’re going to line up for your third preseason game. I think that would be great,” Philbin said.\nLandry, McCain jostle: Jarvis Landry continued his outstanding camp with short touchdown receptions against Kelvin Sheppard and Brice McCain. Landry’s 7-yarder against McCain, along with Jones’ pick-6, were the plays of the day.\nLandry and McCain both talked about how much they’re enjoying their battles.\nLandry said he appreciates “his vibe, the way that he plays, the type of player that he’s going to be and the way he’s going to contribute for this team.”\nMcCain said trash-talking is part of the fun.\n“It’s jaw-jacking all day,” McCain said. “But it’s all fun and games. We’re making each other better.”\nGood day for Sturgis: Caleb Sturgis, trying to fend off Andrew Franks for the kicking job, had a strong performance. He was four-for-four with a long of 49 yards inside the bubble, then hit from 46 and 51 yards outdoors.\nCancer Challenge off and rolling: The organization hosted the first Dolphins Cancer Challenge (formerly Dolphins Cycling Challenge) training ride of the year. CEO Michael Mandich said one of the strongest turnouts they’ve had for training — nearly 200 — turned out to go 18, 34 or 41 miles. Many then attended practice, drawing looks from fans wondering why all these people in cycling duds suddenly strolled in. The challenge will be held Feb. 20.
