Ignacio’s strongest sustained winds were reaching 105 mph winds Monday morning, but forecasters said the storm would become a Category 1 hurricane by Tuesday and weaken into a tropical storm by midweek as it encounters southwesterly winds. \nThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu lifted tropical storm watches for the Big Island and Maui on Sunday evening and said the storm should not have much impact on the islands, although some rain and wind was still possible. \n“It’s hard to say we’re out of the woods because it could make a dramatic shift to the west. It’s possible, I guess, but not likely,” National Weather Service meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said.
