But it is often an irrational fear built upon too flimsy a grasp of the science. This is understandable, and particularly poignant at the moment as we think back to the horrors of the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 70 years ago this month. I have been a nuclear physicist for almost 30 years but I have had very little to do with nuclear power or the nuclear industry. I certainly had very little idea what went on inside Sellafield beyond the basics; that it mainly operates these days as a reprocessing plant, cleaning up nuclear waste. When I was given the chance to go behind the scenes to film Britain’s Nuclear Secrets: Inside Sellafield I saw the opportunity for the nuclear industry to tentatively open its doors to the public and show off the science and engineering that takes place behind the tight security and barbed wire fences. Sellafield nuclear power station in Cumbria I was probably a little cynical initially that what Sellafield claimed to be full access would in fact be a carefully controlled and tightly restricted peek only at what they wanted us to see. So I made it clear from the outset, I would not act as the nuclear industry’s mouthpiece, but instead wanted to tell the story of our nuclear past, warts and all, and to give an honest appraisal of how far the industry has come since then. I am not a journalist; nor am I part of any politics lobby. Even as a scientist, I have no vested interest in whether Britain has a nuclear future or not. Whether I say good or bad things about nuclear power has no bearing on my research funding. However, I have never made it a secret that as a concerned member of the public who has a better than average understanding of scientific issues, my worries about climate change mean that I am convinced that nuclear power is a necessary part of our energy production capabilities alongside renewables.

Despite all of this, I am nevertheless deeply critical of the damaging negative perception people have of today’s nuclear industry. This film, I hope, will go some way to addressing that. Sellafield is an incredible place. It is steeped in history, from Windscale (Britain’s first nuclear reactor) and Calder Hall (the world’s first civil nuclear power station) to Thorp, a remarkable state-of-the-art nuclear reprocessing plant and one of the largest in the world. The sheer scale of the place is astonishing, from giant indoor cooling pools to remotely controlled robotic arms the size of a house – all operated under the most frustratingly scrupulous safety procedures.

But it is important television. I firmly believe that anyone who feels that they have a say about our nuclear future – so anyone who has a vote in our democracy – should watch it and make up their own mind.
