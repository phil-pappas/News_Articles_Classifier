Marion van Dijk \nMiranda Monopoli and Jackson Monopoli, 6, in front of the Originair Jetstream aircraft at Nelson Airport before their inaugural flight from Nelson to Palmerston North. \nHe said the flight experience was good, albeit a little cramped. \n\"I wouldn't like to get a rugby team on [the plane] but it was good,\" he said. \nThe cabin was fully booked for the first Originair flight bound for Palmerston North when it left Nelson Airport on Wednesday morning. The 19-seat aircraft was the first to fly the direct route since Air New Zealand cancelled their service to Palmerston North earlier this year. Marion van Dijk \nKelvin Scobie, tax advisor and passenger on the inaugural Originair flight from Nelson to Palmerston North. \nNelson couple Maia and Neville Taylor often travel to Palmerston North to visit family. Neville had bought an Originair flight for Maia to travel to Palmerston North on Wednesday where she would stay for four days. Neville was staying back in Nelson, but his kind gesture was not given without condition. \n\"There was a trade off, Maia is going up to Palmerston North and I'm going to the Gold Coast to watch car racing in October,\" said Neville. \n\"It's a fair trade.\" Conditions aside, the couple were pleased with the reintrodction of a direct route to Palmerston North from Nelson. \"We'd normally go up on the ferry,\" said Maia. It wasn't all well-seasoned passengers on the inaugural flight - Its youngest passenger Jackson Monopoli, 6, had never flown on a plane before. \"I liked seeing the ground below me\" he said. Despite a smooth landing in Palmerston North, Jackson was not prepared for the bump as the wheels hit the tarmac. \n\"I got such a fright,\" he said. \nJackson won the flight for first-time flyers in a competition on Facebook. \nOriginair chief executive officer Robert Inglis also flew on the inaugural flight. \n\"It's very rewarding after a long time planning,\" he said. \n\"From an operational point of view it's a pleasant route to fly, there is no serious terrain.\" \nPalmerston North Mayor Grant Smith said having the direct route between the city and Nelson was \"solid\". \n\"There's no real fear [Originair] won't work, there's a strong business network between the two [regions],\" he said. \nWith a growing business market in Manawatu and growing tourist numbers in the region he said the direct route could offer a different attraction for the Nelson and Tasman region. \n\"There's some strong economic and business drivers that will make this work.\" \nOriginair managing director Mike Curry said customer demand for flights to Palmerston North had exceeded expectations. \"The flights for the first day were fully booked, there were people booking through the night,\" he said. The airline is also introducing a route to Wellington in September, Curry said pre sales had shown \"good demand\" Nelson Airport chief executive officer Rob Evans said introducing the new airline created a positive feel for the airport, providing consumers with more opportunities to fly. The airport had constructed a new check-in counter in time for Originair's first flight. \"That was a little challenging but [Nelson Airport] worked well with [Originair] and it came together smartly,\" he said. He said the counter would remain in place temporarily until larger scale developments on the airport commenced in the next year or two. \nCrowded skies \nWith Originair off to a flying start, other airlines are eyeing up Nelson airport as a launch pad to success. \nKiwi Regional Airlines revealed the prices for its first flights to and from Nelson yesterday, with flights set to start at the end of October. \nAccording to its website, a direct flight from Nelson to Dunedin one-way on Wednesday October 28 will cost $149. \nAn economy fare from Nelson to Hamilton one-way will cost around $184. \nA direct flight from Nelson to Queenstown was around $229. \nPrices are subject to change but provide an early insight into what customers might expect to pay for the new service, which aims to fill gaps in the domestic flight market. \nMeanwhile, Jetstar is also considering Nelson to be one of four regional destinations in New Zealand. Nelson was considered by Jetstar New Zealand Head Grant Kerr and other representatives in June. The airline is expected to confirm whether they will commit to the region in September. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T12:55:15.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
