That’s why we’re delighted to partner with the Gold Coast Airport and Gold Coast Tourism Corporation to roll-out the Calling All Sun Lovers campaign.”\nThis latest push to drive greater domestic growth complements Jetstar’s moves to grow international traffic through the Gold Coast Airport over the past year.\nThe low fares airline has recently added services to Fiji, Queenstown and Wellington, and now offers more than 10,000 international seats a week in and out of the Gold Coast Airport.\nIn the financial year ended June 2015, Jetstar carried more than 2.8 million passengers in and out of the Gold Coast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:27:54.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
