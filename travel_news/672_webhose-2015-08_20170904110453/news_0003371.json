Representing the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs was Noa Furman, the Director Africa Department 1 – East Africa. From the Seychelles side Minister St.Ange was being accompanied by Rosemarie Hoareau, the Director of Marketing at the Seychelles Tourism Board and Arie Goldstein, the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Seychelles in Israel.\nAfter being welcomed in Israel by Minister Levin who had echoed his appreciation for time dedicated for this bilateral meeting out of a tight official program, Minister Alain St.Ange of the Seychelles said that “Seychelles alone could do things the Israel could not and that Israel could keep on doing things that Seychelles could not do, but together we could do more and this through the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) where we could push for peace to become a focus at the coming General Assembly that will be held in September in Columbia”.\n“Being a spokesman for an inviting Seychelles, one that is known as being the best for a sun, sea and sand holiday and one that has moved to place its culture as the base of its tourism marketing and through this approach placing its people at the centre of its development because there can be no culture without our people. We say that we are convinced that tourism, the industry that remains the pillar of the Seychelles economy is also the largest part of many individual economies of member states in the Community of Nations who will be present at the UNWTO’s General Assembly in Columbia. Tourism’s long term consolidation deserves much more attention and to achieve this objective, peace and security deserves much more attention” the Seychelles Minister St.Ange said.\nSeychelles, the islands that are always described as the last paradise were present in Israel to claim their fair share of the Israeli holiday makers saw their Minister lead a workshop with the travel trade of Israel as well as an open dialogue with the Israeli Press. The island’s Minister St.Ange proudly positioned Seychelles as the leader in Sustainable Tourism Development citing that over 52% of the island’s land area had been zoned Protected Reserves and where everyone was working together for the inhabitants of the islands to be remembered as good custodians of what they had been blessed with. “What you see today, the pristine environment that continues to attract holiday makers searching for holiday destination with a difference where the culture of a people known as melting pot of cultures welcome visitors with their unique blend of cuisine, music, dance and arts.\nSeychelles got confirmation during their delegation’s working visit in Israel that some six direct non-stop charters would be put on the run Tel Aviv / Seychelles route between now and December. The charters would be organised by two different Israel Companies. The private sector accompanying Minister St.Ange on his working visit to Israel were Alan Mason, the MD of Mason’s Travel, Guillaume Albert, the MD for Creole Travel and Daniella Payet-Alis, the Owner of Seychelles Reservations.\nMinister Yarin Levin of Israel and Minister Alain St.Ange of the Seychelles and their respective destinations discussed many points of mutual interest and both assured each other at the end of their meeting of their intention to cooperate for the benefit of their respective countries.\nSource:- Seychelles Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:33:21.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
