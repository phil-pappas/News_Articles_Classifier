Inflation led to the increases in ADR and RevPAR as well as a 17.6% year-over-year increase in revenue.\nDue to another month with difficult-to-match comparisons from the FIFA World Cup 2014, Brazil reported decreases in the three key performance measurements: occupancy (-2.7% to 58.5%), ADR (-28.1% to BRL254.24) and RevPAR (-30.0% to BRL148.79). Supply has grown year-to-date at 2.9% in the country when compared to the same time period in 2014, while demand is down 4.2%.\nColombia saw a 2.8% increase in occupancy to 58.0%, a 9.2% rise in ADR to COP251,490.64 and a 12.2% increase in RevPAR to COP145,766.23. According to Oxford Economics, inflation in Colombia is expected to reach 4.2%, and the value of the Colombian Peso dropped 9% in July.\nPerformance of featured markets for July 2015 (local currency, year-over-year comparisons):\nOccupancy in Bogotá, Colombia, decreased 0.2% to 55.5%. However, ADR in the market was up 15.0% to COP285,912.93, and RevPAR increased 14.7% to COP158,685.22. STR Global analysts expect the number of visitors to Bogotá to increase as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines re-installed a flight from Amsterdam to Bogotá in March 2015, and Avianca increased its frequency from London to Bogotá in early July.\nPanama City, Panama, saw an increase in occupancy (+4.7% to 50.3%), but decreases in ADR (-6.2% to PAB99.33) and RevPAR (-1.8% to PAB50.00). Supply growth has outpaced demand for several years in the market. Both metrics have grown year to date at 8.5%, but high supply continues to pressure rate.\nSão Paulo, Brazil, reported a 1.9% decrease in occupancy to 59.3%, a 19.1% drop in ADR to BRL308.82 and a 20.7% decline in RevPAR to BRL183.18. The market was unable to match comparisons from last year’s World Cup even while hosting events such as ForMóbile, Feira Francal and CeMAT South America.\nAdditional performance data\nLooking for performance data for a market not featured in this month’s release?
