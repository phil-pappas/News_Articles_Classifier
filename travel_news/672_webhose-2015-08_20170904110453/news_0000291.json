Most were arrested were for drunken behaviour such as fighting or criminal damage, as well as drug-related crime. \nThe officers will be in full British uniform and will begin patrols on Monday, spending the first week in Magaluf before they then head to San Antonio for another week in a trial operation. \nSimon Manley, the British ambassador to Spain , said: “The presence of UK police officers will help to remind British holidaymakers of the importance of respecting local laws and customs, ensuring that everyone has a safe and enjoyable holiday, free from trouble and crime.” \nThe Mallorcan authorities have tried to alter the image of the resort of Magaluf by introducing restrictions on pub crawls and drinking in the streets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T12:59:00.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
