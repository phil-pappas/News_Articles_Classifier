Men and women compete against each other, as do older and younger riders. It can be thrilling to watch. More \nIt is becoming compelling behind the scenes too. A US property tycoon is determined to transform the sport and has launched a legal battle that has implications on sports from cricket to cycling to skiing. \nFor decades, showjumping has often seemed to be the sole preserve of the wealthy. \nLast weekend, at Valkenswaard in the Netherlands, Brash was competing against Athina Onassis, the last heir to Aristotle Onassis’ shipping fortune, and Jessica Springsteen, daughter of musician Bruce Springsteen, both riding multi-million-pound horses. \nBy the side of the course, guests drank champagne, ate sushi and lobster and watched on from a giant glass-walled chalet that resembled the lair of a James Bond villain. \nRoughly 95 per cent of the revenues from the event came from sponsorship deals with luxury brands such as Longines, the Swiss watchmaker. \nFor all its drama, showjumping has limited television revenues and a complicated schedule of overlapping competitions. Brash, its superstar, earns a fraction of the sums on offer in tennis, golf or Formula 1 and the majority of riders earn nothing — they pay to take part. \nEnter Frank McCourt. The 62-year-old American property developer was looking for a new sport in which to invest after selling the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in 2012 for $2.15bn. \nAfter an acrimonious and public divorce, he met and fell in love with Monica Algarra, a 40-year-old American showjumper who introduced him to the sport. “Without me, he would not know anything about horses,” she joked. \n“I am a person interested in sport, but I did not know a lot about jumping. I had an outsider’s view,” says Mr McCourt. “But I do not think my view is exceptional; most people unfamiliar with showjumping see it as a fragmented, confusing, difficult to understand sport. And it should be straightforward.” \nMcCourt hired Blackstone to evaluate the sport’s prospects and its advisers introduced him to Jan Tops, a Dutch Olympic showjumping champion, who started the Global Champions Tour, a new competition, in 2006. \nThis year, the tour will take the world’s top riders through 15 cities, including Miami, Shanghai, Monaco and Doha, as they compete for $12m of prize money. ©Getty Frank McCourt \n“Blackstone came back and said Jan was the person doing the most in the sport,” says Mr McCourt. \n“We met in Paris in October 2013 and I bought half the Global Champions Tour in February 2014,” he says, declining to reveal the price he paid. \nAccording to accounts filed in Belgium, Tops Trading, the holding company for the Global Champions Tour, made a pre-tax profit of €5.5m in 2013. \n“We can complement each other,” says Mr Tops of his partnership with Mr McCourt. “I have known this sport by heart for 30 years. I know all the stakeholders. But we needed a more commercial side, on the sponsorship and television.” \nTogether they hatched a plan for a simpler format – a “Champions League” starring 15 teams, each paying up to €2m to enter the league and consisting of four main riders. Two of the riders can be from the top 30 in the world rankings and two have to be upcoming riders. \nThere will be a transfer window for the teams to poach riders from each other. The teams will score points throughout the season, and a prize pot of €7.5m is on offer. Mr McCourt compares the format to that of Formula 1. ©EPA Jan Tops rides in 2004 \nThe plan is to launch the competition early next year. Onassis, who is ranked 348 in the world and married to Brazilian Olympic show jumper Álvaro de Miranda Neto, has already said she wants to own one of the teams. “It will be great for the sport,” says Brash. “More sponsors, more television and it will bring more outsiders into the sport and allow people to understand it a bit better.” \nBut the plan ran into an obstacle. After 16 months of negotiations, showjumping’s governing body and regulator, the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI), has not approved the new competition. And, according to a rule introduced in 2013, anyone competing will be banned from other events, including the Olympics, for a six-month period. \n“I was not surprised. I know how they think,” says Mr Tops. \n“I think it is wrong for them to block it,” says Brash, adding: “They are worried the Champions League will take over from the Nations Cup”. \nThe Nations Cup and the World Cup are events not only regulated, but owned by the FEI, and Mr McCourt and Mr Tops have accused the body of a conflict of interests. Like many sports governing bodies, the FEI has both a regulatory role and its own economic activities. ©Getty Athina Onassis \nThe problem is widespread, said Filip Tuytschaever, a lawyer at Contrast Law in Belgium who is representing Mr McCourt and Mr Tops. “We have seen lots of examples. The European Commission ruled 15 years ago on Formula 1. There is a similar case right now with the International Skating Union,” he says. “The problem is when sports bodies use their regulatory powers to benefit their own economic activities.” \n“Recently international sports federations have not received good press,” adds Mr Tuytschaever. “What we see is a few people have a lot of power. Sport is now very much an economic activity with a lot of money involved and the governing bodies have to accept that they need to divide their regulatory powers from their economic interests,” he says. \nThe governing bodies that control swimming, badminton, cycling, darts, figure and speed skating, powerlifting, volleyball, boxing, cricket, dance sport, fencing, gymnastics, hockey, netball, sailing, shooting and skiing all have “exclusivity” rules banning athletes from taking part in competitions that they do not sanction. \nLast month, Mr McCourt and Mr Tops won a key victory when a Belgian court favoured their interim motion asking for a suspension of the FEI’s rules so that they could set up their new league. They plan to launch it early next year. However, the FEI has contested the ruling and the court will hear an appeal on September 3. \nAsked if it had a conflict of interests, Mikael Rentsch, the FEI’s legal director, says: “Ensuring that international events are run under the rules of the international governing body is not unique to equestrian sport. Other international federations have similar provisions in their rules and much tougher sanctions for breaches.” \nHe adds that the governing body’s rules have to be followed to “ensure horse welfare and protect the integrity of the competition”, and that Mr McCourt and Mr Tops submitted “incomplete” rules for the new competition. “Full details of how the series would be run were not forthcoming,” he says. \nIn the meantime, Mr McCourt is adamant that he will press ahead, and says the new league will be “great for the riders”. \n“The marketplace will begin to decide what compensation they can earn,” he adds. \nWhich will be music to Brash’s ears. Revolution in sport: splits through the years 1893. Rugby \nNorthern English clubs wanted to compensate players for loss of wages when playing games. But the rugby union was against “professionalism” and implemented rules in an effort to preserve the “spirit and interest” of the game. Nevertheless, 12 clubs broke from the union and eventually evolved into Rugby League. 1977. Cricket \nKerry Packer decided to set up a rival series featuring some of the world’s top players, including the England captain. This led to condemnation from the cricketing establishment, and some governing bodies cut the players from their touring sides. A truce was hammered out. 1992. Darts \nLeading dart players decided to form their own group after becoming dissatisfied with the governing body due to the game’s dwindling TV coverage. The players were suspended. They eventually reached an out of court settlement and formed their own group. Today, the rival bodies run separate world championships. 1999. Motorsport \nThe European Competition Commission began an investigation into Formula One and the FIA, the governing body of motorsport in Europe, alleging that the FIA was abusing its power to stifle potential rivals. The investigation was closed after the FIA agreed to limit itself to a strictly regulatory role. \nThis article has been amended since original publication to reflect the holdings of Tops Trading .
