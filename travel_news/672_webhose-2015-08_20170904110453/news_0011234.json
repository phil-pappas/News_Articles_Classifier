Get cancel-for-any-reason travel protection and research weather forecasts and water levels before you depart.\n__Q: Last November, my wife and I and another couple took a Viking cruise, Portraits of Southern France, on the Saône and Rhone rivers. Of the seven nights of the cruise, we spent six tied to a dock because of high water caused by abnormally heavy rain the week before. We were bused to most of the places we were supposed to visit.\nI looked online and discovered this was a frequent problem, and this ship often did not cruise for the seven promised days. I also spoke to a crew member, who admitted, quietly, that it happened at least 50 percent of the time.\nWhen I contacted Viking after returning home, they offered us about $240 each toward another cruise. After paying almost $7,000, that is unacceptable. We booked a Viking cruise because we believed it would offer us an exceptional journey through southern France. Instead, we spent six days tied to a dock and had two-hour rides on a bus. Could you help us secure more substantial compensation? —Paul B., Vero Beach, Florida__\nA: As I said to Paul in our initial reply, we don’t usually pursue river-cruise cases that are affected by high or low water levels. This is true even when they become, in many ways, bus tours. We know cruise lines are not obligated to offer compensation when they must change itineraries for reasons outside their control.\nIn this case, however, our interest was piqued by the claim (admittedly unverified) that the Portraits of Southern France cruise is affected half the time. We suspected it was an amount inflated by the crew member who spoke to Paul, but it seemed reasonable to contact Viking for an explanation. It took three months, but we did receive a thorough answer from a Viking spokesperson.\n“While we cannot verify whether or not [he] actually spoke to a crew member—or the content of that conversation—the claim he makes about the itinerary is hearsay and is wholly inaccurate.\n“It is extremely rare that we need to modify an itinerary to the point where passengers experience little to no river cruising. In fact, overall, across all of our itineraries during a sailing season, only about two percent of total cruise days end up experiencing a significant disruption as a result of high or low water. Because of the unique characteristics of the region, our “Portraits of Southern France” itinerary is slightly more susceptible to high water on the Rhone River. But even then, only about five percent of total cruise days on that itinerary experience a significant disruption where sailing isn’t possible.”\nFair enough. And what about compensation when a ship doesn’t ply the waters of a river, but instead floats at a dock where it waits for buses to arrive and depart with disgruntled passengers?\n“Even though, as you point out, weather is out of Viking’s control, we recognize that this experience was not what guests want to remember. ... To that end, we extended an offer to [him and his wife] to receive 25 percent of their cruise fare in the form of credit toward a future cruise. That value is obviously different than the number [he] cites. … [He] and his wife have not yet accepted the future cruise credit, but the offer is certainly still open to them. Otherwise, if they purchased trip insurance, they may instead proceed with filing a refund claim with their insurance provider.”\nOf course, most passengers would prefer a refund or credit commensurate with the loss of value, but determining that amount is quite difficult. In this case, given that Viking is not obligated to offer compensation, a 25 percent future cruise credit seems reasonable, although we understand why passengers believe they should receive more, since they did not, for the most part, cruise on a river.\nWhat’s a bit odd, however, is the suggestion that Paul and his wife might receive a refund through their insurance provider. An altered cruise itinerary is not a covered reason for a refund, and it strains credibility to suggest Viking would not know that. Paul, who purchased the trip insurance offered by Viking, contacted the insurance provider, Trip Mate. It verified that it would not offer coverage. I followed up with Viking and asked why it would make that suggestion.\nEssentially, Viking said it doesn’t know what insurance will or won’t cover, but it feels the offer is fair. And I would agree, deciphering the ins and outs of travel insurance can be like navigating a dense thicket, but why give false hope of a refund, which seems like something that would invite a backlash? Sure enough, it did. Paul was none too happy about being asked to unnecessarily jump through one more hoop.\nOf course, that was not Viking’s intention, nor does it appear its explanation of what happened on the cruise was deceptive, but it certainly didn’t help its cause by offering a non-viable alternative to its compensation.\nSo, is there a suitable way to protect yourself against similar circumstances? Many cruise lines offer travel insurance that will allow you to cancel for any reason up to the day of departure and receive a credit toward a future cruise. The trick is knowing whether and when to cancel. Cruise companies don’t generally inform passengers of itinerary changes until they arrive at the ship.\nReports in the international media can clue you in to trouble well before you depart. Check foreign newspapers and news sites online—many are available in English. It’s also a good idea to contact the tourism boards of the countries that the ship will be sailing through, which should be aware of local conditions and offer impartial information. Another option is to track down cruise operators based in the country that you plan to visit and to find out how they are dealing with the situation. If they aren’t sailing, your company probably isn’t either.\nStill, as the numbers divulged by Viking show, it’s rare, even in southern France, for a cruise to stall at a dock for days. If it looks to you like traveling by river would be a great way to see a country, why not take the precautions above and get ready to set sail?
