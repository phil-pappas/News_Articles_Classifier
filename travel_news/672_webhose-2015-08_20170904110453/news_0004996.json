It is best for a day out with attractions to suit younger and older visitors - and cheaper than some other theme parks, even if you do not buy tickets online in advance. Usefully, you can pay a small supplement to buy online tickets that are redeemable on any day the park is open until September 27, so you can change your plans if the weather turns bad. • The ultimate guide to the UK's theme parks What's new Hyper Drive dodgems is newly-opened for this season and based on a New York theme (the dodgems are a mix of yellow taxis and blue NYPD police cars). Minimum height is 1.2 metres. Also new for 2015 is the Wild West High Dive show, a stunt performance where five, gun-toting divers perform acrobatic feats, either individually or in synchronisation, diving from 25m into a pool only 2.7m deep. The accompanying story of two feuding cowboy families, narrated by a land-based compere, is incoherent and hard to follow but the dare-devil performance is spectacular, especially the moment when a ball of fire engulfs one of the divers as he plunges. Thumbs up The Wipeout rollercoaster gets five stars for its Vertical Gs of 5.2, 50mph speeds, and backwards (and inverted) twists and loops. Also good for thrill-seekers is HoBs PiT which is rated 12A and claims to be one the scariest theme park experiences in the UK. Using real actors, this is a part walk-and part ride-through attraction is based on the story of a ghostly miner whose tortured spirit haunts the dark tunnels. However, you don’t have to have nerves of steel to enjoy this park. There are plenty of other exciting, if less spine-tingling and gut-wrenching rides for a calmer day out such as Enigma and the Rattlesnake. Also 12 rides for small children grouped in the centre of the park, including a mini pirate ship and mini twisters. Thumbs down Rides can be closed or not open until later in the day - making it difficult to plan a timetable. On the day we visited Marble Madness didn’t open until early afternoon, with no clear explanation for its closure. The food offerings are depressingly predictable. At the Merry Mariner\", the largest sit-down restaurant on site (smelling of cheap frying oil and rather chaotic with several uncleared tables when visited at lunchtime) there's pizza (£9.50), chips £1.90, beans £1.50. plus a daily \"specials\" menu (pastas, pies etc). Better to take your own food as picnic areas are provided. • 50 great days out in the UK Top tips Some rides have height restrictions in the 1.25-1.4 m range, making them unsuitable for very young or short children. Check the website in advance for specifics. Locker access can be purchased at reception for £5 per day Kiddy Karts (simple push-along carts for up to two small children over one) can be hired at £5 a day. Useful as there's quite a lot of walking to get around. Ticket prices above are for online purchase, for redemption until September 27, 2015. Reductions apply to tickets bought online for use on a specific dates. If you are a fan of animal- and bird-based performances, don't miss the Sea Lion show performed by either Claude or George which is excellent - and a good opportunity for children to see these large, intelligent mammals close up. There’s also a Parrot Show (twice daily). Arrive in good time for the start, late arrivals aren't admitted. Price Over 12s £17.50; under-11s £15.50; seniors £14.50; children under one meter free.
