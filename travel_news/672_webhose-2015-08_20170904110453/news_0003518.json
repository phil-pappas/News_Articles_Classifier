In some instances, depending on the distance and the number of people traveling, a jet may be appropriate. For that same client in other circumstances, a four-seat Cirrus may achieve the results they need at a better price.\" \nflyADVANCED operates from three mid-ATLANTIC locations: Wilmington, Delaware (KILG), Blue Bell, PA (KLOM) and Lancaster (KLNS), the latter dedicated exclusively to piston aircraft maintenance and repairs. \nIn addition to the newly added Falcon 50EX and King Air B350i, flyADVANCED also offers a Bombardier Challenger CL601, Gulfstream IV, Raytheon Beechjet 400A, Beechcraft King Air B100, Cirrus SR22, Cirrus CR22T and Cirrus SR22 GS. \n\"Even the flyADVANCED Aircraft Owners Group will sometimes find a different aircraft to be a better solution for their travel needs,\" noted de Ramel. \"Given the breadth of our fleet and its location, flyADVANCED can provide a variety of air transportation solutions with a single phone call. That is and has always been the client advantage of Integrated Aircraft Management.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:51:45.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
