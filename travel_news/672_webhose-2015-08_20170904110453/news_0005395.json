Throwing oneself down a mountain on a pair of skis, or jumping out of a plane according to a cord bungee jumping might not seem the most appealing to people of all ages. If you were going to take a bet on who is doing it, you might well go for the younger generation. New research from Inghams , the skin and snowboard holiday company, has found that the over 65s are the most adventurous age group – far from what some might expect. Snowboarding is popular with the adventurous over 65s (Alamy) Half of those surveyed said that fear does not stop them from doing sports of all kinds, and of all sports, snowboarding and bungee jumping and particularly popular. While the younger generation might appear to be keener on getting out there doing exciting sports, when asked, just 15 per cent of 18-24 year olds said they would try kitesurfing while 35 per cent of the over 65s were keen to give it a go. The stereotype has long been for cruising holidays that they are purely for the over 50s but Inghams’ research has discovered that more pensioners would be enthusiastic about going on an adventure holiday rather than a cruise. We reported last week that many of the over 55s are habitual in their holiday choices, often choosing to return to the same place time after time, but Inghams have found that travelling alone is popular too. 50 per cent of those surveyed said that they would happily travel alone and go on holiday. Trekking is a great way to see the world (Alamy) But what happens when you get to an age where suddenly you’re expected to stop being active and adventurous? 71 year old Rex Willoughby has not let his age stopper his enthusiasm for getting out there and doing things. After being diagnosed with prostrate cancer in his mid 40s, he found inspiration to get out and explore the work. “It was a wakeup call,” he says, “and encouraged me to go and do more good deeds and help improve my wellbeing.” Since then, he has travelled the world, visiting everywhere from Dubai to New Zealand, and started running marathons to raise money for prostrate cancer charities. In March last year, he trekked for 10 days on the Goyko Ri summit climb , raising a total of £7,000 for his grandson’s charity. Eight year old Harrison suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , and to help, Rex treks on a yearly basis to raise money to help find a cure . Rex is taking on all sorts of active challenges (Rex Willoughby) “I climbed Kilimanjaro when I was 60, and took up water rafting too,” he explains. A heart attack 12 weeks ago set him back a little. “I was thinking about doing a skydive, but since my heart attack happened so recently, I don’t know how much of a good idea it is. I have to assess the risks of what I’m doing, but fear is no barrier.” It isn’t just the charity element that motivates Willoughby to get involved with extreme sports. It’s also for his own sake. “I do it for my own wellbeing too. Soon, my days will be over and I want to fit in everything before this happens.” “I have done everything I have ever wanted, and feel a huge amount of satisfaction in doing more.” Rex Willoughby (right) on his travels (Rex Willoughby) Going around the world is good for meeting people too, Willoughby explains. “I have met plenty of older people from across the world with the same mindset.” “Now I’m divorced, I don’t want to sit alone in the front of the television watching time go by,” he says. “I swim three times a week, go on daily walks and keep active at the weekends too.” When we spoke, he had just finished at the gym, a place he visits every day: “I used to love running – I was good at long distances but my knees are getting sore so I’m relaxing from running for a little while.” If that isn’t inspiration to get active, then it’s hard to know what is.
