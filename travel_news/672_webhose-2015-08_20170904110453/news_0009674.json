Universities look for outstanding grades in science subjects – especially biology and chemistry – as well as a passion for the subject, and evidence of commitment to the field. • University applications: tackling aptitude tests • Medical school: get ahead with your application There's also the compulsory exam for students applying to medical and dental degrees. Most medical schools use the UK Clinical Aptitude Test, also known as UKCAT. The exam helps filter through the many highly qualified applicants who apply to medical programmes, so make sure you take time to prepare. The test focuses on exploring attributes considered to be valuable for health care professionals, not necessarily traditional academic achievement. The successful individuals will be ones with the most suitable attitudes, mental abilities and professional behaviour. It also assesses students' ability to sift data and weigh evidence from different sources, as well as reasoning skills and judgment In terms of proving your passion for the subject, make sure you get some first hand experience, this could be volunteering or taking part in medical work placement. Most take place over the summer months and are aimed at 16 to 18-year-olds who are considering applying to medical school. It isn’t unusual for universities who offer medicine to set up their own summer programmes as well. These are definitely worth looking into, as the experience will strengthen your interest in the subject as well as helping you to stand out on your personal statement. Another option is to contact local hospitals and hospices, as many have their own volunteering programmes. For placements that take place before you submit your personal statement, candidates should try to demonstrate how the experience changed their perceptions of the industry or what relevant skills and qualities they picked up in the process. However, it isn't only specifically medical experience that can be beneficial, Mary Platt, learning and teaching director at the University of East Anglia medical school, explains. “There are many ways that students can discover, assess and test their suitability for a course. Working in McDonald's, for example, gives lots of customer service experience; dealing with people from all walks of life. It’s often what prospective students get out of the placement rather than what they do.\" Being able to talk about your experience is essential for medical school applications Indeed, listing numerous work experience placements isn't always helpful on a personal statement. Platt continues: \"It’s not about listing the 53 bits of work experience you’ve done. What we want is somebody who has thought about what a future doctor needs and can demonstrate that they’ve got the attitudes and beliefs and values that are going to make them the doctor that you and I want to look after us in old age.\" Making sure degree and student are compatible is a running theme when it comes to applying to med school, and many places offer experience for this reason. The Oxford Royale Academy offer a two week medical course, over the summer months, with the intention of it helping students with their application. Participants take part in workshops where they get a taster of what life would be like as a medical student; including performing basic procedures such as blood tests and how to use a stethoscope. While this course is for 16 to 18-year-olds, some of the summer schools arranged by universities are available for even younger students. University College London (UCL) – number four in the league tables for studying medicine – is a prime example as it has a Target Medicine Summer School aimed at Year 11 students. The scheme is free and lasts a week, taking place on the UCL medical school campus and gives students looking into this subject a first hand account of what to expect. • Medical school: maximise your chances of getting a place • Medical school applications: maximise your medical mojo During that week, students will be mentored by medical students; can meet nurses, doctors and patients, along with visiting local hospitals and engaging in clinical situations. In terms of getting through to the interview stage, being able to talk about your experience is, once again, essential, as Dr William Coppola, divisional tutor and subdean at the UCL medical school explains: \"A lot of medical school short listing will take place on the basis on what’s on the written application, so if candidates have no work experience then they would be at a great disadvantaged.\" Coppola suggests that it is not just academic intelligence that stands out at the interview stage. Speaking about UCL, he says: “We would be more keen on candidates showing a broader interest in health and contemporary matters at their interview, and to show awareness and problems that are occurring in the health service. \"They need to show that they can think and reflect intelligently on a situation.” “The interview is about looking at other things like their work experience and their individual strength and resilience. It's to see how they see themselves fitting into a medical career, albeit very early in their career pathway”. Work placements are essential for students wishing to commit to a career in medicine and for those who want to secure a place at medicine school. Although much of what universities are looking for is centred around the individuals and what they learnt from their placements; getting a taste of what to expect before investing in a five year course is an added bonus. Applications for courses in medicine, veterinary medicine/science and dentistry for 2016 entry need to be submitted to UCAS by 6pm on October 15. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:29:26.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
