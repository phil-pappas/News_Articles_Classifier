Chinese School made its debut on Tuesday, and soon became one of the top topics on social networks in both China and Britain, with many education specialists commenting and retweeting. In the documentary, five Chinese teachers took over a British classroom with 50 teenagers aged 13 and 14 in Bohunt School in Hampshire for one month , and taught them in a typical Chinese way: no talking, no questions, wearing a special uniform and experiencing the harsh classroom discipline within an extended school-hour from 7am to 7pm. Students in the experimental program had to do morning exercises, took compulsory physical education of long-distance running, and were also required to do eye exercises during breaks. Some of the students were caught on camera in tears — as was one of the teachers. At end of this episode, most of the teens found it difficult to adapt to the Chinese methodologies. Some of them even described their Chinese teachers as \"rude\" and \"unreasonable\". Their teachers were not prepared for the stark differences between Chinese and British students as well. One of the teachers couldn't help but complain that the classroom was always \"chaotic\" to the head teacher of the school. Many Chinese netizens, especially the post-1980 netizens, said that the documentary reminded them of past school-days. Meanwhile, they criticized the British students as \"unmannerly\" and \"lack of respect to others\" after watching the documentary. Chu_hsi, a weibo.com user, said:\"I agree that Chinese classroom discipline is too strict, to some degree. But a free style classroom means that students can discuss academic issues in better atmosphere, not eating, putting on make-up or doing whatever you like. The British students lack the most basic politeness. This is the issue of upbringing.\" I hope the parents of some of these children are horrified to see how ill behaved their kids are His comment won more than 2,000 praises in weibo.com in a short time. Meanwhile, lots of British netizens had the same feelings. On Twitter, Jo Boyne's comment \"I hope the parents of some of these children are horrified to see how ill behaved and disrespectful their kids are\" got much approval as well. However, in the latest interview with Chinese media, Zou Hailian, the mathematics teacher in the program from Hangzhou Foreign Language School, said that his British students were nice children with good manners. \"In the first episode, students look lax and absent-minded sometimes. To me, this is understandable. Normally, there are less than 20 students in a British classroom. Now they have 50 students. What's more, they have to stay at school for 12 hours each day, even longer than the school-time in Hangzhou Foreign Language School. They are not accustomed to it for sure,\" he said. Compared with British students, Zou stressed that Chinese students usually study harder and have a clearer goal due to their parents' demands and their own planning. But British students have their own characteristics. \"British teens always say 'make the world different'. They care less about good marks or low marks, but pay attention to extracurricular activities. They have very good coping capacity and hands-on skills. In addition, they are mostly good at making speeches,\" he added. Furthermore, Zou pointed out that China's tough education system produces strong results in subjects like math and science, capturing the interest of educators in the U.S. and Europe where some feel the child-centered approach does not do enough to teach the basics. No doubt the Chinese teachers featured will also learn from the UK's approach to teaching Though Zou's words were recognized by several education experts in China and Britain, there are several voices in defense of the British education system. Kathryn James, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers in Britain, defended the British school system and said it had advantages over China's. \"Student autonomy, questioning and the development of skills to allow students to think for themselves are the key elements in British pedagogical approaches - and do not appear to be part of the Chinese approach. As teachers involved in the program take lessons from the experiment, no doubt the Chinese teachers featured will also learn from the UK's approach to teaching,\" she said. Simon Jenkins, a British columnist, wrote \"China's schools are testing factories. Why is Britain so keen to copy them?\" for The Guardian, and taunted the traditional Chinese education style. \"Chinese parents crave the British private schools being set up across China. Chinese students cram into U.S. and British universities. They can see that a dragooned, mechanically competitive schooling is no path to creativity, challenge or happiness in the long run in a dynamic economy and a critical open society,\" he wrote in the article. Roo Stenning, a Twitter user, commented,\"We don't need Chinese teachers to improve British schools – and it patronizes my colleagues to say so.\" At the same time, many British complained not about the Chinese teachers, but about their own country's education system. Richard Spencer, a Telegraph journalist whose children once attended schools in China, wrote in his article, \"It is, perhaps, the first to expose so clearly the differences in our schools to those in China, whose indeed well-disciplined pupils are now in some cases two to three years ahead of our own in measurable subjects like maths and science.\" Children should learn to show respect to their parents at home and to their teachers in school Many Twitter users expressed their discontentment regarding the British education style as well. \"I also think sport should be made compulsory in the UK, and run on a system similar to China, \"Twitter user@ Flamingo said. \"If British schools, in the main, are places of constant supply of entertainment to pupils (at break time and during lessons alike) then the name of these institutions should be changed from schools to something else, maybe comedy clubs instead of schools - where the chief clown is normally the head teacher,\" a Twitter user commented. Twitter user@Daniel.E considered that British parents should examine themselves after watching this documentary. \"Children should learn to show respect to their parents at home and to their teachers in school. This is what all the parents should tell their children since their childhood. However, the children in the documentary show that their parents, without any doubt, set a very bad example to them in daily life,\" he said.
