We took her to a room in a wheelchair so she could rest,” the South China Morning Post reported an officer as saying. \nThe woman had attempted to carry a bottle of Rémy Martin XO Excellence – typically sold for at least $200 – onto her flight to Wenzhou, having bought the alcohol in the United States. \nPassengers can only carry liquids under 100ml in their hand luggage on flights. \nAfter she downed the cognac, the captain of her flight barred the woman from boarding as he was concerned she might hurt herself. Zhao was collected by her relatives after sleeping it off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:25:04.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
