A number of offline members are also active in the market, including, Austrian, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines and SWISS. \nMark Schwab, CEO Star Alliance commented that the Best Airline Alliance Award was testament to the dedication of Star Alliance member airlines in Australia. \n“We are delighted to win this important award. With more airlines serving this market than any other alliance we offer our customers a significant choice of flights and transfer connections. It shows that by working together, even without a domestic presence in Australia, our member carriers can deliver genuine benefits to the country’s international business travellers.” \nAustralian Business Traveller Awards were judged by a panel of business travel experts, with honours presented across 33 categories, including first class suites and business class seats, airport lounges, frequent flyer programs, inflight food and wine and travel technology.
