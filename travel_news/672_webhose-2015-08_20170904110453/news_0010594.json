This simply means, if you purchase 10 Firefly tickets you are entitled to 10 entries. The more you travel with Firefly, the higher the chances of you winning this one-of-a-kind BMW.\nThis high-visibility campaign was organized as a way to reward our passengers for flying with us and over 50,000 entries were received.” Ong added.\nOver the course of the campaign, ten (10) lucky winners were chosen each week to win Firefly Cash Vouchers worth RM100 each. Weekly winners were announced every Monday in Firefly’s website and one (1) of Malaysia’s leading newspapers. For the final draw, four (4) Grand Finale winners were chosen culminating in a brand new BMW 320i Sports Line car for one (1) lucky passenger, Mr. Liang Yee Kai, a 29 year-old certified financial planner from Pulau Pinang.\nLiang flew four times with Firefly during the campaign period and sent an entry each time.\n“As a financial planner, I have to travel all over the country to meet my clients. Firefly has always been my airline of choice due to its flight frequency, convenient city airport location in Subang, good punctuality record and competitive price. So when the “Fly Firefly & Win a BMW” campaign was launched, I did not hesitate to book all my flights to Kuala Lumpur on Firefly as all I needed to do was to send a short text message to participate in the draw.\nI could not believe my ears when I received the phone call to inform that I had won the BMW 320i. My first thought was – this must a prank call from one of the local radio stations! It took several minutes for the Firefly representative to calm me down and convince me that this was not a joke,” said Liang when asked about his reaction to winning the luxury car.\nLiang explained that one of the first things he would like to do upon receiving his new orange car is to take it for a spin around Pulau Pinang island.\n“I would like to congratulate Mr. Liang Yee Kai as today he will be driving home the one-of-its-kind BMW 320i Sport Line custom-painted with Firefly colours. This campaign was just one of the many promotional activities that we have planned for 2015. Please continue to fly with Firefly and check us out on our Facebook page regularly or sign up as a member today to make sure that you don’t miss out on any of these exciting activities” said Ong.\nThe three (3) remaining Grand Finale prizes were Mr. Ng Khai Ming, Mr. Shamsul Bahrin Bin Abdullah and Ms. Sri Kiruthyha Murugesan. Please see the enclosed List of Winners for details.\nFirefly is currently running a “Firefly Merdeka 58″ promotion where competitive fares, starting from RM58 nett one-way, are offered for all its domestic destinations. In addition to that, the first 500 passengers who redeem the unique promo code, which is revealed daily on its Facebook page and print advertisement, will get a RM58 discount off their flight base fares. This limited promotion starts from 24 – 28 August 2015, and available for travel between 24 August 2015 until 26 March 2016.\n“I am also pleased to announce that Firefly will operate a new route from Kota Bharu to Langkawi three times weekly. The inaugural flight is scheduled on 25 October 2015 and ticket sale starts today via all our sales channels including airport ticketing office and travel agents.\nFirefly will market this sector and simultaneously promote the attractions that these two destinations have got to offer,” Ong concluded.\nSource:- Firefly", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:07:46.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
