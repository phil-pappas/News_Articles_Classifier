Along with a new 13,000 square foot multiuse pavilion area for additional indoor and outdoor function space, the project will expand the 6-acre water park with an additional pool, spa, cabanas, two water slides, lounge chair seating and artificial turf lawn space. The project is scheduled to commence in September 2015 for completion in spring 2016. The new pavilion, event lawn, surrounding pool and seating areas will offer pre-function and event space opportunities for group meetings, golf tournament banquets, dining, wedding events and other celebrations. The expanded event space will rest beautifully into the existing topography and enhance the opportunities for open-air entertainment receptions. The additional indoor and outdoor venues will allow groups to reserve private spaces while also enjoying the remainder of the Texas -sized outdoor pools and waterslides. Adjacent to TPC San Antonio, the newly developed area will be ready to host team-building events, outdoor awards dinners and wedding and corporate receptions. Amid 600-acres of picturesque rolling oak-covered hills and currently offering the largest hotel customizable convention, meeting and event space in the Texas Hill Country, the new 13,000-square-foot stand-alone ballroom will bring the resort's total event space to 278,000 square feet. The ballroom and exceptional event lawn will provide unparalleled venues for any size or type of meeting or group gathering. Designed to benefit from San Antonio's average of 300 days of sunshine a year, the year-round green turf lawn will be adjacent to the new ballroom to offer a scenic outdoor event space looking into the unobstructed views of the surrounding pristine Hill Country terrain. \"The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa is dedicated to offering our guests a warm heart welcome with unique and best in class experiences and premium amenities,\" said Arthur Coulombe , general manager, JW Marriott San Antonio. \"Our southwest San Antonio climate enables travelers to enjoy our River Bluff Water Experience the great majority of the year while our Texas Hill Country attentive culture reflects in our hospitality. We are thrilled to offer additional recreation space to our leisure guests and multiple flexible meeting and entertainment options to our group customers.\"The new design will enhance the River Bluff Water Experience by adding a beach-entry gradual slope swimming pool complete with two new body slides, one with a dramatic 60-foot drop. An additional 230-poolside lounge chairs and plenty of shady overhangs will create a relaxing vacation experience for families and corporate guests alike. Multiple cabanas available to reserve will be added around the new pool area. All of the new features and enhancements will be in place for travelers visiting during spring break in 2016. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:38:06.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
