Australia continues to be the biggest source market for tourists into our region and we believe that this trend will continue.” \n“Our South Pacific Specialist Program, we believe is the key tool for travel agents and travel wholesalers to fully understand the various destinations in the region and better equip them to entice travelers to the South Pacific. In these workshops we will introduce each of our Pacific Island destinations to agents and direct them to online tools that will assist in this learning process via the SPTO website,” Mr. Vuidreketi added. \nThe two-day roadshow will be held from August 25-26, 2015 at the Crowne Plaza in Newcastle and the Rocks in Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T08:40:00.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
