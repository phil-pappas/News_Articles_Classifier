Citing statistics that the majority of casualties in the raids to date were women and children it accused the Germans of murdering blindly in raids of a cowardly nature due to the fact they only occurred on the darkest of nights “so as to afford the maximum chance of escape from our aeroplanes and guns.” Not all did in this occasion, as one of the Zeppelins involved was damaged and then destroyed, which was the aspect of the raid the headlines focussed primarily on. The leader then went on to probably the most vehement castigation of the Germans so far in the paper – “The whole foul business is of a kind to sicken the very soul of any man with the faintest spark of military honour in him. It is born of a mere blood-lust, a cannibal appetite for simple slaughter, with an added delight in the helplessness of the victims which is perhaps the most repulsive of all the symptoms of moral degeneracy.” Strong stuff indeed. Also in today’s paper - Russia is still being drive back in Poland, losing Lomza and preparing to evacuate Vilna – page 6 . The situation must be serious as the Telegraph doesn’t even bother to dispute the German account as per usual at the moment. However a German naval squadron is repulsed in the Baltic near Riga to provide some kind of counterweight ( page 7 ) - The fighting around Hooge sees a violent artillery engagement which renders all the trenches in open ground south of the village untenable – page 7 . - Sir Ian Hamilton reports an advance of 200 yards at Gallipoli, as well as a fresh landing which has made “considerable progress” - page 7 , a report which enables a leader to assert fresh optimism about the situation there on page 6 - A destroyer is sunk by a mine in the North Sea – page 7 . The report focusses on the 26 survivors; only at the very end do you find that her usual complement was 100 - Sir Hiram Maxim, of machine-gun fame, announces he has invented a new apparatus to protect soldiers against gas attacks – page 7 - Two lady tram conductors in Portsmouth give their pay to charity – page 7 - “A tropical thunderstorm” hits South London, whilst a storm in Manchester kills two men working in a sewer – page 8 telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:47:29.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
