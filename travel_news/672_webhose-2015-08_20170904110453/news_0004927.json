The airline is looking to the Peregrine Falcon, the spaceship from the Star Wars films, for inspiration in October and transforming two of its planes by giving them Star Wars-themed liveries. One of the planes, a Boeing 777-300ER, will be decorated with an image of BB-8, a new character set to appear in the forthcoming film Star Wars: The Force Awakens, due to be released on December 18.

The airline had already announced that a special R2-D2 –themed Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner will be taking to the skies as part of a deal with The Walt Disney Company in Japan. • The ugliest airline liveries The Star Wars theme will be continued inside the planes with character headrests, napkins and cups. The airline has also secured exclusive rights allowing it to broadcast all six of the currently released Star Wars films on board – the first time any Star Wars film has been available on a commercial flight. • ANA business-class review Exact routes for the planes have yet to be announced but the R2-D2 ANA Jet will initially fly between Tokyo and Vancouver on October 18 before taking in a couple of other American and European cities. The planes will then serve domestic routes in Japan in November. The BB-8 ANA is expected to fly international routes in March 2016. “We’re thrilled to unveil the designs of our new Star Wars themed planes, and I’m sure fans across the world will love the look,” said Osamu Shinobe, President and CEO of ANA. ANA's R2-D2 plane Photo: Star Wars copyright &TM 2015 Lucasfilm Ltd. It is not the first time that an airline has attempted to liven up its liveries with recognisable characters. The ginger quiff of Tintin graced a Brussels Airlines plane in March , while Air New Zealand’s long-running promotion of The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films means that you can hardly board a plane without thinking of Middle Earth. Even the face of England’s most famous bard, Shakespeare, has appeared on a plane . EasyJet lent its support to a campaign for there to be a national William Shakespeare Day last April and flew an image of Shakespeare's head around to drum up interest. These are not the worst plane liveries to have ever been painted however. From bird beaks, to Hawaiian florals, these are some of the world’s most garish plane liveries .
