The California-based authors provide recipes for how to use the generous harvest, plus informative, relaxed gardening advice on tomato varieties and how to plant and tend them. Super sweet and citrusy tomatoes alike are pretty near perfect in this rustic cornmeal cake. Use bicolor yellow varieties splashed with streaks of red.\nPineapple (Tomato) Upside-Down Cake Makes 1 cake; 8 to 10 servings\n1 pound (1 very large or two medium) very ripe, sweet tomatoes\nGarden Harvest Photo Contest Enter to win a $50 or $100 gift card from Molbak's Garden + Home.\n8 tablespoons (1 stick) plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature, divided, plus more to butter the cake pan\n½ cup dark brown sugar, packed\n2 teaspoons orange zest, packed (about 1 medium orange), fruit reserved for juicing\n1 teaspoon lemon zest, packed (about 1 medium lemon)\n½ cup honey\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten\n½ cup sour cream\n¼ cup freshly squeezed orange juice\n ¾ cup all-purpose flour\n1 cup cornmeal\n1½ teaspoons baking powder\n½ teaspoon baking soda\n¼ teaspoon kosher salt\nCrème fraîche and honey, to serve (optional)\n1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly butter a 9-inch round cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper and butter the paper. Slice the tomatoes 1/3-inch thick and spread them out on paper towels to drain.\n2. Melt 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat in a small saucepan. Add the brown sugar and cook just until the sugar is melted, about one minute. Pour the brown- sugar paste into the prepared cake pan and immediately spread it out as evenly as possible using a heatproof spatula. Combine the orange and lemon zests and sprinkle 1 teaspoon over the top of the brown sugar.\n3. Combine the remaining 8 tablespoons butter, honey, eggs, sour cream, orange juice, and remaining 2 teaspoons of orange-lemon zest in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix well. (Alternatively, use a hand mixer.) In a small bowl, whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, add the butter mixture, and mix until just combined.\n4. Blot any moisture off the tomatoes and arrange them decoratively in the bottom of the pan. (Leave a little space between the slices to see the patterns in each.) Pour the batter over the tomatoes. Bake until the cake is lightly brown, starts to pull away from the sides, and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes.\n5. Run a knife around the edges of the pan, place a serving plate on top, and (wearing oven mitts!), flip the cake onto the plate. Allow the cake to cool completely. To gild the lily, serve the cake with a dollop of crème fraîche and a drizzle of honey.\nRebekah Denn : rebekahdenn@gmail.com ; on Twitter: @rebekahdenn .
