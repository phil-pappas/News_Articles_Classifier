The government of Malaysia is committed to ensure that the rejuvenated Malaysia Airlines will take off on a strong note. We hope to see more progress driven by the new entity especially in terms of service levels.” \n\nMAS’ chairman Md Nor Yusof added: “This is a start of a new beginning. MAB will endeavour to ensure our passengers are given the best of our services and we will persevere to build a sustainable national icon.” \n\nAll assets and liabilities from MAS will be ported over to MAB, according to Khazanah Nasional, the parent company of the airline. \n\nKhazanah added in a statement the revamped airline will be akin to a start-up company, equipped with a “refreshed Malaysian-centric brand”, young fleet and updated products on all longhaul flights, including flat beds in Business class and a better in-flight entertainment system. A new catering concept and more customisable flight experiences will also be on offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:53:53.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
