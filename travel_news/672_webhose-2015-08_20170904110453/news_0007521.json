The addition of a concierge service will ensure that travelers onboard Etihad flights will have access to unparalleled service, rivaled to what is expected on a private jet rather than a commercial airline. \nSky service Etihad revamped the cabins of its Airbus A380 aircrafts last year to bridge air travel with hotel accommodations. The Residence features a living room, separate double bedroom and en suite shower room. \nEach of Etihad’s A380 aircrafts offers a different version of The Residence by using different color palettes, table marquetry and custom carpets to separate one experience from the next ( see story ). \nWith Ten Group, Etihad will use intelligent systems, global support and unmatched supplier relationships to provide expert concierge service to its travelers. \nEtihad Butlers at the London Savoy \nThe Etihad Lifestyle Concierge team will deliver highly personalized and discreet experiences to provide travelers with access to a range of services such as restaurant reservations, entertainment bookings, special events, information on the intended destination and lifestyle services. \nIn a statement, Etihad Airways’ chief commercial officer Peter Baumgartner said, “We have chosen to collaborate with a provider possessing the global reach and expertise which meet the demands and expectations of our most discerning guests. With the launch of the Etihad Lifestyle Concierge, in partnership with Ten Group, we are taking luxury airline travel to levels never experienced before. \n“Whether it is for a last-minute booking at a top London restaurant, tickets for a Broadway show, or even the purchase of a rare blue diamond, our fully connected fleet will enable us to assist guests staying in the Residence by Etihad with their requirements immediately, 24 hours a day, at 35,000 feet and with the most professional levels of service.” \nTen Group was an ideal partner for this initiative as it serves the needs of affluents in 22 languages from its offices in cities such as New York, San Francisco, Miami, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Mexico City, Cape Town, London, Brussels, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai, Melbourne and Dubai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:14:35.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
