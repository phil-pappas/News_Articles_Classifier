Flights EK011 from Dubai, and EK012 from Gatwick will become A380 services from January 1. \nEmirates had only recently moved forward its second Gatwick superjumbo service – originally planned for June this year but bumped forward to April as a result of passenger demand. \nThe announcement means Emirates will offer 70 A380 flights a week into the UK, more than any other country on the Emirates network. \n“The deployment of a third A380 to London Gatwick now means that travellers to and from London can enjoy our world-class A380 on every flight,” said Hubert Frach, Emirates divisional senior VP of commercial operations west. \n“In the last five years we have increased capacity into London by over 25 percent. This demonstrates the attractiveness of the A380 with its ability to serve customer demand at slot-constrained points without the need for adding another frequency,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:23:05.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
