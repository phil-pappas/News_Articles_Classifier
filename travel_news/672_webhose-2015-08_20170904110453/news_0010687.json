Drivewise ® Mobile – Allstate's award winning smartphone application – now prominently features Allstate Rewards. In addition to saving money on their auto insurance every six months, safe drivers now can use the upgraded app to earn points and use the points for deals on merchandise, gift cards and local offers.\nWith this additional benefit, Drivewise Mobile becomes the first of its kind offered by an insurance company. Any driver can earn Allstate Rewards points, regardless of whether they have an insurance policy with Allstate.\nIn the latest iteration of the app, Allstate continues to encourage safe driving for everyone through a point system offering savings on merchandise from big-name brands. While most reward programs generally require someone to make a purchase or pay their bill to earn points, consumers simply need to drive safely to benefit from Allstate Rewards.\n\"We continue to drive advances in product and service innovation for all consumers,\" says Allstate Connected Car Vice President Ginger Purgatorio . \"We're providing cutting-edge capabilities to better serve drivers and protect what matters to them most. This is another example of how we are changing the way people think about an insurance company – and at the same time, it encourages safe driving that benefits everyone on the road.\"\nAlso new in this version of the app are interactive challenges that allow users to earn reward points. One example is a challenge to drive below 80 mph or avoid hard braking for three consecutive days. Users can view their challenge statuses and driving patterns by month. The challenges will be updated in future app updates.\nAllstate customers in 47 states not only benefit from Allstate Rewards, but also are eligible for savings on auto insurance through the telematics program. Initially established in 2010, the Drivewise network continues to grow and is expected to approach more than one million users by the end of 2015.\nDrivewise Mobile is available for free download in the Apple iTunes store or through Google Play for Android devices. The app now offers audible alerts in the iOS version and a text blocking option in the Android version.\n(*Drivers in New York are not eligible for Allstate Rewards.)\nThe Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) is the nation's largest publicly held personal lines insurer, protecting approximately 16 million households from life's uncertainties through auto, home, life and other insurance offered through its Allstate , Esurance , Encompass and Answer Financial brand names.
