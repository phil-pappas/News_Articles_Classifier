Warrior and cobra poses will be a regular sight on the hotel’s rooftop pitch, ‘Heaven’, this summer as barrecoreALDERLEYEDGE hosts a series of complimentary yoga classes for guests every Wednesday morning, throughout August. \nThe one hour class challenges participants both physically and mentally, featuring barrecore signature positions against a soundtrack of inspiring and uplifting music, blending rock, reggae, hip hop and chilled sounds. It’s a fast-paced class which focusses on building length through the muscle groups and freeing up the spine, toning limbs and tightening of the core. The classes are Hotel Football’s latest health and wellbeing offering, joining HIIT classes which are also trialling this summer. Stewart Davies, Hotel Football general manager, said: “It’s important to us that our guests feel fully refreshed after their stay at the hotel and a key part of that is down to health and wellbeing. “Hosting sessions like this allows us to offer guests something completely unique - a workout against a backdrop of the best views in Manchester.” Classes will be held every Wednesday at 7am throughout August.
