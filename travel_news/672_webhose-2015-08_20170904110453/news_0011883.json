But the world is changing and it is important we recognise that cloud-based technology is now the prime point of entry to a global travel network. Our members need to leverage this technology if our local industry is to flourish.\n“HAA is confident that providing our members with affordable access to a market-leading platform, via SiteMinder, will increase their exposure to both domestic and international markets, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ultimately, it is by increasing the profile of our local boutique sector that we will boost Australia’s hosted accommodation sector and tourism as a whole.”\nTheBookingButton forms part of SiteMinder’s award-winning product suite, used today by more than 19,000 accommodation providers around the world. Using TheBookingButton, HAA members now have the ability to receive direct online bookings without paying third-party commissions as well as capitalise on the booking engine’s fully-customisable features, which integrate it seamlessly into a property’s website to deliver higher, measurable conversion rates and greater revenue.\nSiteMinder’s Director of Sales – Pacific, Michael Kinloch, says: “SiteMinder’s partnership with HAA is a response to the pervasive challenges that today’s accommodation operator faces; trying to keep up with technology while trying to fill their rooms and tending to guests at the same time. With TheBookingButton, HAA members now have the opportunity to use the same type of easy-to-use technology that their competition, large and small, is using, both here in Australia and around the world. The difference is HAA members can get all the benefits but at an even lower cost.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:33:35.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
