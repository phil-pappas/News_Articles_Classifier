Stowell brings more than 19 years of program development, implementation, evaluation and management experience to the table, as well as an impressive resume of leadership positions from many zoological and conservation organizations. Most recently, she served as the executive director of Pueblo Zoo, Pueblo CO; and educational director at Woodland Park Zoo, Seattle, WA. \n“Unfortunately, there are not enough women in high-ranking positions. Nationwide, less than 15 percent of women hold executive positions. Stephanie is a strong executive leader that will bring synergy to our education and conservation programs locally and globally,” said Shannon Block, president and CEO of Denver Zoo. \nStowell’s proactive attitude led to the creation and initiation of many conservation educational programs throughout the country, of which she had operational oversight. Though rising to the top in either a nonprofit organization or public corporation is not always an easy task, Stowell was able to use her leadership skills and acumen to make a measureable impact in a relatively short period of time. \nShe served in a number of education program management roles for the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), the nation’s largest membership-based conservation organization. During the 10 years she was with NWF, she was the senior manager, educator programs, Reston VA; senior manager, regional educational programs, San Diego, CA; director of education, Western regional programs and senior director of national field education programs in Seattle WA. After her stint with NWF, Stowell assumed the role of director of education at the Woodland Park Zoo, where, as a child she realized her passion for the sustainability of animals. Stowell’s mother was a docent at the Zoo, so she learned first-hand the importance of educating others about animal conservation. \nEarly in her career, Stowell co-founded Clark Fork Watershed Education Network, Missoula MT, where she developed programs dedicated to water resources education. There she designed and facilitated educational programs involving public schools and surrounding communities. \n“It has long been a professional and personal dream of mine to join the team at Denver Zoo,” Stowell said. “The new master plan and strategic imperatives with education, conservation and guest experience at their core excites me.” \nIn this role, Stowell will guide staff as Denver Zoo continues to develop educational initiatives that will support its commitment to provide exceptional learning experiences for the Zoo’s on-campus and off-site programs. \n“We are excited to have Stephanie join Denver Zoo and lead our learning experiences team,” said Amber Christopher, senior vice president of guest experience. “She is a recognized leader within the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), with a proven record in informal science education. Stephanie’s wealth of knowledge and passion are vital to helping the Zoo reach our mission to secure a better world for animals through human understanding.” \nStowell earned a M.A. in Education Curriculum and Instruction with a concentration on Environmental Education from the University of Montana. She also holds a bachelor’s in Asian Studies from the University of Oregon. \nAbout Denver Zoo: \nDenver Zoo brings education alive, providing a unique learning experience that sparks an interest in the natural world for visitors and program participants alike.
