The editors at Cheapflights.ca have compiled a list of the most popular sleeping positions on airplanes and have deciphered what each says about that flyer. (Fotolia) \n\"The Eyes Wide Open:\" Flight after flight, these flyers try to catch some sleep, but it most often eludes them. Eyes Wide Open flyers like to use flight time to catch up on work, a TV show or marathon some movies. (Fotolia) \n\"The Mile High-Maintenance Hibernator:\" These passengers come prepared, determined to bed down for the long haul against all odds. Eye shades, ear plugs, headphones, pajamas: the Mile High-Maintenance Hibernator is fully decked out and ready to fly. (Fotolia) \n\"The Spooner:\" Sleepy Spooners prefer to slumber in the friendly skies locked at the hips of their partner, family or friends. It’s already a tight squeeze in those airplane seats, but consider yourself a Spooner if you’re cuddling up with your seat neighbour. (Fotolia) \n\"The Lucky Lounger:\" This flyer is that lucky passenger who has an empty seat next to them. The Lucky Lounger can spread out and catch some sleep in peace and quiet. (Fotolia) \n\"First Class Lay Flat:\" Lucky for first-class airline passengers who want to catch some sleep: many airlines now have first-class seats that recline completely and allow travellers to sleep flat on seats that transform into beds. (Fotolia) \n\"The Straight Jacket:\" Arms crossed, knees bent, feet on the floor. These flyers can easily sleep sitting straight up, which is perfect for long flights. (Fotolia) \n\"Hoggy Style:\" This flyer really spreads out when they sleep, whether there are other passengers beside or in front of them, or not. They often claim the armrests beside them and sometimes even put their feet up on the armrest in front of them. (Fotolia) \n\"Hit the Tr-hay:\" What some see as a surface for food or a book, these flyers use the tray as the perfect pillow in the sky. Add a blanket or pillow and Hit the Tr-hay passengers have all these need for a good sleep on the go. (Fotolia) \n\"The Fetal Position: These flyers are petite enough to curl up into a ball in their seat and peacefully drift off.
