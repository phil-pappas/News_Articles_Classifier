Happ. By Ryan Divish Seattle Times staff reporter \nMINNEAPOLIS — Manager Lloyd McClendon announced his starter for Tuesday’s game against the Rockies at Coors Field and it may come as a bit of a surprise to people. \nLeft-hander Vidal Nuno will come out of the bullpen to make the start in Denver in place of the recently traded J.A. Happ. \nNuno doesn’t lack for starting experience. He’s been primarily a starter for most of his career. He’s made 73 minor league starts and 31 starts at the major league level. He’s 3-13 with a 4.08 ERA in those MLB starts. \n“It’s just another day,” he said. “Now I just have to go 80-100 pitches and set the tone of the game.” Most Read Stories Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's \nNuno’s last start came with Class AAA Tacoma on July 5, when he was briefly sent down. He worked six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits with a walk and six strikeouts to get a win. He threw 93 pitches in the game. \n“He can go five easily if we need him to,” McClendon said. “He’s very durable and he’s rested.” \nNuno is excited for the opportunity. \n“I’m thrilled,” he said. “I can’t wait. Now it’s just preparation and trying to go through the lineup three to four times. It’s all about going pitch to pitch and hitter to hitter.” \nThe obvious question for many fans would be: Why is Roenis Elias not getting the start? \nThe young left-hander has major-league experience and success at the highest level. After starting the season with Tacoma, Elias was inserted into the rotation in April and made 13 starts, posting a 4-6 record with a 4.27 ERA. \nHe was sent back down to Tacoma in early July when Hisashi Iwakuma was activated from the disabled list. It’s been his performance with the Rainiers since then that has delayed his return. \nOn Saturday night in Las Vegas, he lasted just two-thirds of an inning, giving up five runs on six hits with a walk. And after he was removed from the game, he was ejected for arguing with the home plate umpire over an earlier balk call. \nElias’ numbers and approach to his starts has been less than ideal for the Mariners. Since being sent down, he’s 1-1 with a 7.81 ERA in six starts with seven walks and 19 strikeouts in 272/3 innings pitched. \nAnd that’s part of the holdup on him being called up. \n“I would say that’s probably the biggest reason,” McClendon said. “Those outings matter. I don’t think you ought to promote kids to the big leagues for mediocrity. You have to do well. That’s one of things we are trying to change in changing the culture — you have to perform. He’s got to pitch well to be promoted.” \nMcClendon labeled it a “spot start” for Nuno and said he isn’t taking Happ’s place on a full-time basis. Notes \n• Ketel Marte had three hits — two on the infield — and also drew a walk to reach base three times. He also scored the go-ahead run and made a nice play, advancing to second on a wild pitch in the 11th inning. \n“It’s normal now,” he said of the big leagues. \nWith Robinson Cano almost ready to return to playing in the field after a strained abdominal muscle, Marte said he may be playing center field in the coming days. \n• Nelson Cruz extended his hitting streak to 13 games, going 2 for 5 with his 29th homer of the season. During the hit streak, he’s batting .407 (24 for 59) with four doubles, eight homers, 12 RBI and 11 runs scored. His career long streak is 19 games. \n• Carson Smith is still McClendon’s closer despite his recent struggles, which included three losses and two blown saves. \n“I don’t want to get on that emotional roller coaster — you do bad for a couple of outings and let’s go back to Rodney,” he said. “Hell, they tried to run Rodney out of town. Now they want him to be the closer again?” \nMcClendon turned to Smith in the ninth inning with two outs and the score tied at 1-1 and a runner on first. Smith struck out the dangerous Miguel Sano to end the inning. \n• Charlie Furbush threw 33 pitches in his pregame bullpen session — all fastballs. \n“I felt good,” he said. “The velocity was good. They were 33 strikes.” \nFurbush will throw another bullpen on Wednesday in Denver. He’ll mix in his breaking stuff. If that goes well, he will head out on a rehab assignment on Friday. He was originally supposed to threw the bullpen on Tuesday, but McClendon said they wanted to give him an extra day of rest.” Ryan Divish: 206-464-2373 or rdivish@seattletimes.com .
