This U-Haul store is located at 150 Oroyan Avenue, the former home of Ray's Food Place.\nGeneral Manager Brent Pugh is excited to be a part of the Eugene community and is looking forward to continuing Ray's focus on community and sustainability.\n\"We are located in a very new and still growing community,\" Pugh explained. \"This gives us many opportunities, besides the moving potential, that come with the growth around us. We fully intend to have the community help us find our own place in this market and grow with them.\"\nThis 4.62-acre property consists of one 55,737 square foot building. While construction is underway to bring additional services to the store, this U-Haul location currently offers truck and trailer rentals . Plans for this facility include the addition of climate-controlled self-storage , a hitch bay, a U-Box container distribution center and a full-service rental center.\n\"We have great plans for the building and every facet of it will embrace the community,\" Pugh continued. \"We have great hopes for the community embracing us as well.\"\nThe acquisition of Ray's Food Place was driven by U-Haul Company's Corporate Sustainability initiatives : U-Haul supports infill development to help local communities lower their carbon footprint. Our adaptive reuse of existing buildings reduces the amount of energy and resources required for new-construction materials and helps cities reduce their unwanted inventory of unused buildings.\nVisit U-Haul Moving and Storage of Santa Clara for all your moving and storage needs or call\n(541) 393-8408, Mon. – Thurs. 7 a.m. – 4 p.m. , Fri. – Sat. 7 a.m. – 5 p.m. and Sun. 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. Visit us online at uhaul.com or contact U-Haul Reservations, at 1-800-GO-UHAUL.\nTo learn more about U-Haul in the news, visit My U-Haul Story .\nAbout U-Haul\nContact:\nKristi Hickman\nSebastien Reyes\nEmail: publicrelations@uhaul.com\nPhone: 602-263-6194\nWebsite: uhaul.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150828/261955\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b\n releases/u-haul-repurposes-former-grocery-store-to-expand-services-in-eugene-300134718.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Truck-Rentals-near-Eugene-OR-97404/700071/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=truck-trailer-location", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://myuhaulstory.com/category/media-relations/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=uhaulcom", "http://www.uhaul.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA89196&Transmission_Id=201508281241PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA89196&DateId=20150828", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://www.uhaul.com/Storage/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=self-storage", "http://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Trailer-Rentals-near-Eugene-OR-97404/700071/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=truck-trailer-location", "http://www.uhaul.com/About/History.aspx?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=uhaulcom", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/u-haul-repurposes-former-grocery-store-to-expand-services-in-eugene-300134718.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150828/261955", "http://www.uhaul.com/UBox/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=ubox", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150828/261955", "http://www.uhaul.com/Articles/Sustainability/6/U-Haul-Building-Green-Initiative?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=real-estate&utm_medium=sustainability-footer"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:08:47.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
