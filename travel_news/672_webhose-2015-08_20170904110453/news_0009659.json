Charlie Baker established after a disastrous winter for the T.\nA February estimate from the administration pegged the cost of erasing the maintenance backlog at $6.7 billion. The new report took a closer look at commuter rail station and rail needs, in addition to the condition of rail cars.\nThe report will be presented to the Legislature as it decides how much to allocate to cut down on the backlog. The backlog could be wiped out by 2040 if the T spends $765 million annually on the maintenance backlog — rather than the current $610 million.\nFrank DePaola, interim general manager of the T, said the T will be hard-pressed to pay the costs out of its existing budget, which calls for payments on a range of big-ticket expansion and modernization plans.\n“These numbers have not been really reported before, what it would take to satisfy that backlog,” DePaola said. “It’s a significant amount of dollars, and whether or not we can do that and invest in all the other categories of capital investment at the same time, is something we need to talk to the Legislature and of course the administration about.”\nDEVELOPING...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:01:58.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
