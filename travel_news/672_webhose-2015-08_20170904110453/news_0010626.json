They can then download a short video clip that starts as a close-up, but pulls away to reveal the surrounding landscape. \n“The ‘GIGA Selfie’ campaign will help to raise the level of conversation about Australia in Japan as people share their incredible experiences of holidaying here with their friends and family back home,” Tourism Australia managing director John O’Sullivan said in a statement to Mashable . \nThe first two opportunities to take a mega selfie will be in Queensland’s Gold Coast on September 5 and 6, the website added.
