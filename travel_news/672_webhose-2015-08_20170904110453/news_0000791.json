Gear and Gadgets \nTitan Loop Key Chain USB Cable is $30 at www.fusechicken.com. ADVERTISEMENT Gear and Gadgets: Titan Loop Key Chain USB Cable \nA company called Fuse Chicken bills its proprietary USB cables as the “toughest on Earth.” Responding to a near-universal complaint over cables that fray and separate from their attached connector plugs — rendering the cables useless — the company wraps all its cables in flexible industrial-strength steel, seals the two connector ends in a one-piece, heavy-duty rubber housing, then fuses the housing directly over the electronics and metal cabling. The new Titan Loop Key Chain USB Cable is a 9-inch-long cable that loops in half, with the phone connector end sliding snugly into a rubber-encased slot bonded to the USB connector end. As of yet, the Titan Loop is available only for the iPhone 5, 5s, 5c, 6 and 6 Plus — meaning iOS phones with Lightning connectors. The company plans to branch out into Android territory.
