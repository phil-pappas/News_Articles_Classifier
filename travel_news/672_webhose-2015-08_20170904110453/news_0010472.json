The fight broke out at Allaan’s bedside in Ashkelon’s Barzilai Medical Center.\nThe police, who were called to the hospital, separated the sides and arrested five of the brawlers. Only four, a Jew and three Arabs, were brought to the Magistrate’s Court in Ashkelon for the extension of their remand Thursday. A petition has been filed against the release of the Jewish protester and the three relatives were barred from entering the city for the next 15 days.\nNaji Abbas, Yassin Sabih and Imad Allaan, Mohammed’s brother, are suspected of taking part in the fight and causing injury. The Jewish detainee is suspected of the same offenses but a gag order forbids the release of any identifying details of him. Sabih is also suspected of attacking a security guard.\nImad Allaan, Mohammed’s Allaan's brother arrested after brawl at out hospital. Eyal Toueg Imad Allaan is also suspected of entering Israel illegally. His lawyer said he entered Israel about a week ago with a permit obtained through the Red Cross.\nThe fiancée of one of the detainees from East Jerusalem, Lama Gosha, said Imad was at his brother’s bedside Wednesday evening when a group of visitors started shouting at him.\n“Imad telephoned and said people were coming in and shouting at Mohammed that he’s a terrorist and must be killed,” Gosha said. “He said he asked a nurse to call security. We told the guard that Imad said something had happened and there was a commotion, and then the guard took Imad out and Mohammed was left alone with the Jews shouting at him,” she said.\nSoon after that a brawl broke out, Gosha said. “Thirty people crowded around [Mohammed Allaan and his visitors]. Security came only 10 minutes later and separated them, using pepper spray,” she said.\nImad was arrested about 20 minutes after the incident had ended, Gosha said, “because he was here illegally even though he has been here for a week and the hospital knew it.”\nLast week 13 protesters, Jewish and Arab, were arrested at the entrance to Ashkelon after clashing over Allaan’s arrest.\nA few days later the High Court of Justice suspended Allaan’s detention, after it transpired that his 66-day hunger strike had caused him neurological damage and thus no longer posed a danger. He had been held without charges on suspicion that he is a member of Islamic Jihad and was involved in terror attacks being planned by the organization.\nAlmog Ben Zikri\nHaaretz Contributor\n ", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-08-28T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:57:12.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
