The steel industry is a very difficult sector due to high capital cost, transport cost, high rate of interest but it is this industry that competes with world players, Narendran said.\n“We are competing with Japan and Korea, who have a zero import duty due to FTA (free trade agreement) against our more than 10 per cent”, he added.\nIn fact, transporting our materials from Jamshedpur to Mumbai was costlier than importing it from Korea to Mumbai, he claimed while stressing on the need for infrastructure development.\nTata Steel might have to import iron-ore if the Jharkhand government did not allow the company to dispatch raw-material from its Noamundi mine in Jharkhand, Narendran said.\n“We are now procuring raw material from our mines in Odisha as well as purchasing from local miners, which is affecting our productivity and financial performance”, he said after unfurling the National flag inside the company works here today.\n“We may have to approach the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) for raw material or import it again like we did last year”, he added.\nNarendran said the captive Noamundi mine in West Singhbhum district used to provide 50 per cent of the iron-ore for the company but the state government had stopped issuing challans (forwarding notes), blocking the dispatch of the raw material to its Jamshedpur plant.\nThe matter was subjudice and the company will honour the court verdict when it comes, he added.\nThe Tata Steel MD said the financial performance of the company had been badly affected when it was forced to import iron-ore following the closure of its mines in Odisha and Jharkhand on the lease renewal issue last year.\nThe Noamundi mine is closed since September last on the lease renewal issue. The company had resumed production at Noamundi mine in January, after a gap of four months, he said.\n 15, 2015 5:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:11:52.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
