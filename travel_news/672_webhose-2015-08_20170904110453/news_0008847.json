(Photo: Belfast International Airport)\nTags United Airlines CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE United Airlines will resume direct year-round service between Newark International Airport and Belfast International Airport in 2016, reports the BBC .\nThe route is the only direct link between Northern Ireland and the United States and first began operating 10 years ago. It was discontinued for nine weeks between Jan. 6 and March 11 of this year, but in 2016, United will continue service three times a week during that same period.\n“New York remains a popular destination for travelers and our Newark Liberty hub provides the most convenient route into the city as well as easy connections to hundreds of other destinations across the United States and beyond,” Bob Schumacher, United Managing Director Sale, UK and Ireland, said in a statement released by the airport. “With this schedule change, we are offering our customers even more choice.”\nThe decision by United to return to full year-round service is seen as not only of great significance to the Belfast airport, but to the Northern Ireland economy as well.\n“Our one and only direct, scheduled trans-Atlantic service to Newark Liberty is a ‘lifeline’ for U.S.-owned firms and adds massively to efforts by Invest NI to attract additional and highly prized U.S. investment,” said Belfast International Airport managing director Graham Keddie. “We will do all we can to promote and market the service.”\nWhen the service reduction was announced last year , representatives from Belfast International Airport said they were “naturally disappointed” by the decision.\nThe airport calls the service restoration “wonderful news for Northern Ireland.”\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's \" At the Airport \" columnist.
