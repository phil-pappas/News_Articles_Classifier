Professional manufacturers and distributors of airplane interior products for private and commercial aircraft offer ready-made and custom items meeting FAA requirements.Airplane interior parts for doors, chairs, lights, carpets and restroom differ depending on the plane model. The design, materials used, size and color of parts are adjusted according to the plane manufacturer and/or interior designer's specifications.UpholsteryUpholstery for better aircraft interiors in Texas can be custom designed in a variety of fabrics. Materials available include faux leather, aircraft leather, sheepskin and aircraft upholstery. There are solid color and striped, leaf, herringbone and mosaic designs. For other purposes, distributors of material for aircraft interiors in Texas offer canvas duck, netting fabric, black nylon or beige pack cloth plus other specialty fabrics.FlooringAircraft manufacturers and aircraft owners who want to refurbish their planes have carpet and hard flooring choices. There are many designs and colors in hard flooring for aircrafts, each one crafted for a specific look and aircraft type. Tile patterns, woven textile covers for the cabin and main passenger area. For stairs and high-traffic areas, non-flammable, puncture-proof flooring is made to last long and prevent stumbling and skidding. Marbled stair flooring designs are manufactured in tan, blue or grey marble and several solid colors.CarpetingLike other aircraft parts, aviation carpeting comes in pre-made or custom versions. Carpeting may be wool, nylon or a wool/nylon mix. Premade carpet is usually less expensive and delivered quickly. Customized carpet, made to your specifications for the cabin or other areas of the plane interior will give you the look and durability you want, but may cost a bit more than premade carpeting.Some lightweight aviation carpets help owners save money since the reduced weight means less fuel is used over the life of the carpet. Airplane carpets meet FAA requirements and are manufactured to resist water, mold and mildew. High-quality aviation carpet is static-proof and won't shrink.If you own a small plane and you need to repair or replace upholstery, Legacy Aeronautics aircraft interiors in Texas will help you find the best products for your needs.
