Within 20 minutes, the platters were empty. This record release party took place at the Store Kitchen, a new restaurant within a recently opened design emporium called the Store, off the lobby of Soho House.\n“They demolished the food,” said Tommy Tannock, one of the two British chefs at the Store Kitchen. “ Berlin hipsters love a free meal.”\nEven when the food is not free, the Store Kitchen has been attracting a fashionable mixed crowd of local food lovers, seasoned vegans, creative types working on their laptops and expats craving healthy fare.\nLocated in the center of the Store — a huge, loftlike space shaped like an L — the Store Kitchen has proved to be the heart of the place since its soft opening this spring. A large curved bar offers up a daily-changing buffet of ambitious, vegetable-focused dishes, like a salad of kale with barley, squash, hazelnut and sage. There are also toasts topped with smoked line-caught trout or chunks of avocado, and vegan raw brownies and extravagant cakes from a local baker.\n“We have a very similar point of view,” Mr. Tannock said, referring to his partner, Johnnie Collins, “and basically want to serve what we like to eat, which means dishes made from fresh, seasonal and ethically sourced ingredients.”\nCustomers pick up their dishes at the counter and then sit at one of about 10 colorfully designed tables. Starting next month, the Store Kitchen will spread to another section of the space and offer dinner service, serving small plates and a quirky menu of biodynamic wines.\nAt the record party, Mr. Collins looked up at the hungry crowd and excused himself. “I need to bring out dessert.” Ten minutes later he returned with a large ceramic platter covered in fudgy vegan brownies served alongside coconut kefir pudding.\n“Dip the brownie in there,” he said — the kefir added a bright acidic tang to the rich brownies — then he left again to deliver them to a nearby table. Five minutes later they were all gone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T19:23:13.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
