Recognizing the need to provide convenient and efficient modes of transportation to working professionals in the area, the Sun Trolley has completely revamped service on its Uptown Link Route.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150826/261193\nAs of Tuesday, September 1, 2015 Sun Trolley's free Uptown Link Route will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The route has also been shortened so working professionals will only wait approximately seven or eight minutes to catch an Uptown Link trolley.\n\"Our market research indicates that within just a half mile of Sun Trolley's Uptown Link Route, there are more than 8,000 working professionals in the District,\" said Robyn Chiarelli , Executive Director of the Sun Trolley. \"With so many working professionals in one area, lunch-time parking options are limited and Sun Trolley's free Uptown Link is the convenient alternative.\"\nThe Uptown Link trolleys run from the Cypress Creek Tri-Rail Station, east on Cypress Creek Blvd to the Uptown Centre, north on Andrews Ave., to Microsoft/Marriott, then back south on Andrews to the Cypress Creek Station, and west on Cypress Creek Blvd. to the Citrix Loop.\nTo kick off the new and improved Uptown Link Route, the Sun Trolley is hosting an official Uptown Link launch promotion on September 15, 2015 . The first 40 passengers to RSVP for the September 15 th launch promotion will receive a free gift bag and a free lunch at Blaze Pizza , Jersey Mike's Subs , VooDoo BBQ & Grill or Giraffas Brazilian Grill for riding the trolley that day. Visit the Sun Trolley Facebook page HERE for more information.\nFree service on Sun Trolley's Uptown Link Route is made possible with a grant from the FDOT and in partnership with the City of Fort Lauderdale .\nJust like hailing a cab, the Sun Trolley is a wave n' ride service. Just wave to the driver signaling that you would like to board. When you're ready to get off, just let the driver know where along the route you would like to be dropped off.\nFor more information about the Uptown Link route, visit www.suntrolley.com/uptown-link .
