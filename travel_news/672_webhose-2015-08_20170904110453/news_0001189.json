The strikes are expected to begin during the evening of Wednesday 5 August and last all day on Thursday 6 August before returning to a normal service on Friday. \nMBNA Thames Clippers will be running additional boats during the morning and evening rush hours on affected days, with a shuttle service running between Greenland, Canary Wharf and London Bridge. Services are scheduled to run every 10 â€“ 20 minutes. Historically, the service has come under considerable demand during major tube disruption therefore customers are asked to leave extra time for their journeys. The RB1 Commuter service and Greenland - Canary Wharf - London Bridge Shuttle will run on a first come, first served basis. Passengers on the RB6 Putney to Blackfriars service are strongly advised to pre-book their journey via the website and print out their ticket for travel.
