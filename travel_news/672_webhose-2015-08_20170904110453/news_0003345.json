Film adaptations will take center stage on the Great Lawn: “Henry V” on Aug. 28, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” on Aug. 29 and “The Taming of the Shrew” the following night. Guests can also take in one of the Shakespearean films running on a loop in the Mission Point Theater. The package includes round-trip tickets on the Star Line Ferry, two breakfasts at the property’s Round Island Bar & Grill, and one dinner at Mission Point’s Chianti restaurant, which will offer a special Elizabethan-themed menu and a trio playing Renaissance music. “Stratford on the Straits” starts at $265 a night.
