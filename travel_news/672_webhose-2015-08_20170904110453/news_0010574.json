Kenya has been rated an incredible destination and open for business, deserving great attention to encourage the travel industry with great support, ATA Congress organizers said. \nAddressing the media in Mombasa last week, the UNWTO chief clearly said he was against the concept in which tourist hotel owners deny or prohibit their clients or guests access to local establishments where they (hotel guests) could go out for lunch or dinner or buy items from local traders, thus making the local communities see the benefits of tourism. \nBy not allowing the hotel guests to visit and interact with local communities, this trend denies local Kenyans money from tourists, Dr. Rifai noted. \n“It is unfair for tourists to go to a destination and benefit (only) from all-inclusive hotels. Tourists should be allowed to buy food or drinks anywhere they want,” he said. \nRestricting tourists to the all-inclusive hotels, he argued, makes them a target for attackers, as the locals feel deprived of tourism benefits, he stressed. \nHe noted that such hotels also deprive holidaymakers of an opportunity to interact with locals. \nDr. Rifai said Kenya is now a safe destination in Africa, waiving fears of terror threats which had occupied tourists and other visitors looking to visit this African safari destination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:17:06.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
