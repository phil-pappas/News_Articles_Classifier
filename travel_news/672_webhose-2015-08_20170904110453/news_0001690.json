Most of them make it. \nBut there are still many people in the dark about the experience. Luckily, we have all the introductory information you need. \nWhat is Kilimanjaro? \nMount Kilimanjaro is a dormant volcano in Tanzania in East Africa. The mountain has three volcanic cones - Shira, Mawenzi and Kibo. Kibo is the big brother and it is the dormant cone, while the others are extinct.

Uhuru peak is the highest spot (5985m) and is on the rim of the Kibo crater. \nWhy should I go there? \nIt is a bucket-list adventure. You can walk to the top of the mountain without climbing gear to stand on the edge of a crater while the sun rises over Africa. See the big migration of wildebeests in the Serengeti and dive on coral reefs a few days later - all in Tanzania. \nHow does it work? \nThere are six routes to the top, but only four are regularly used. The most popular is Machame and Marangu, while Rongai and Lemosho are beautiful and quieter alternatives. Marangu is the only route where you will sleep in rustic huts. On the other routes, a tent will be set up for you by porters. Credit: Taher Nassrulla \nYou have to be accompanied by a registered guide. Your backpack will be carried by porters and a cook will prepare delicious 3-course meals and hot drinks. Routes vary in length, but you can spend between five and eight days on the mountain. \nIs it safe? \nYes. There are no dangerous animals on the mountain and mosquitoes do not operate at a high altitude. You might be cold and tired, but you will never be in serious physical danger unless you ignore your body's reaction to the altitude. \nAltitude sickness is the biggest threat to your wellbeing on the mountain. Symptoms include nausea, headaches, loss of appetite and tiredness. \nIs it cheap? \nTo be honest, no. First off, you will have to pay for a flight to Tanzani. \nSecondly, the trekking fees are high, mainly due to the Kilimanjaro National Park fees which cost about $130 per person per day. Park fees make up about 50% of a trekking tour's cost. \nTipping the crew is also standard. Your porters, guide and cooks will expect it as it is the main source of their income. Budget for an amount of 10% of the tour price.

There you will be met by the tour operator's driver. Most trekking tours include this service as well as a night's accommodation before and after the tour. \nHow do I get around? \nYou will be taken to the gate closest to the starting point of your route. This will be done by the tour operator's driver. When you are safely down from the mountain, you will be met by the driver and taken back to the hotel you stayed at before the trek. \nIf you want to tour Tanzania, choose a safari that includes a driver-guide. Tanzania is not suitable for self-drive trips. \nHow long do I stay? \nDepending on the route you choose to Kili's summit, you will spend five to seven nights on the mountain. The more time you spend at high altitude, the better your body copes with the height above sea level - improving your chances of reaching the summit. \nAfter spending money on a flight to Tanzania, most travellers join a safari for a few days after the trek. Some others prefer to rest a while on the beaches of Zanzibar. Make sure to take two to three weeks off work. \nHow do I prepare? \nAnyone can do it, but being fit makes it more enjoyable. Climb stairs, walk with a small daypack (with about 3kg in weight inside) and wear in your hiking boots. Do research on the various routes and choose a good operator. Speak to people who have done it. \nWhat else should I know? \nMost gear can be rented from outfitters in Moshi, the 'trekking base town' in Tanzania, but bring your own well-worn hiking boots and sleeping bag. Fleece and thermal clothing, a day backpack, some snacks, a first-aid kit and willpower are essential. In addition, you will need US dollar cash (tipping), extra batteries for your camera and a sense of humor. Choose a tour operator with experience guides, who treats their porters well and has quality, clean equipment. You will be cold and sore yet ecstatic, with a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. The minimum age is 10. There are many people on the mountain and you will often see a string of hikers on the trail in front of you. There are no showers or toilets. You will get a certificate to confirm your achievement. \nHiking to the top of the highest mountain in Africa is an expensive, bucket-list adventure that can be done by anyone from the age of 10. \nCombine it with a lodge or camping safari for an all-round out-of-Africa experience. \nIf you're interested, speak to the people at Kilimanjaro-Experience.com .
