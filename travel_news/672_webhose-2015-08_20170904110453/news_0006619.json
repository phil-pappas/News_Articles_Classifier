She was christened in the De Hoop shipyard in the Netherlands in April by Corina Lüftner. Passenger capacity: 168 Number of cabins: 84 Style/character 6/10 The ship features a smart silver and purple colour scheme. The passengers were a cosmopolitan bunch from Canada, Japan, Israel, the UK, the US and Germany, mostly aged 60-plus. Most were travelling in large tour groups that tended to stick together, making it hard to mix and mingle. On the Danube, Budapest • Luxury cruises: 12 incredible rooms on the river Cabins 8/10 Most cabins are identical, with the same silver and purple palette as the lounge, and surprisingly spacious. All have a roomy bathroom with glass shower, plus a walk-in wardrobe and floor-to-ceiling windows that open from the centre railing upwards rather than from side to side. Lower-deck cabins have a high sealed window but are otherwise the same. I was in one of the 12 suites, which are larger and include a sitting area and a balcony just big enough for one person to perch on its stool. • The best European river cruises for Autumn 2015 At your leisure 7/10 Excursions wise, Amadeus offers optional tours so passengers can do their own thing without feeling they have paid for something they don’t want. Tour prices on my cruise, from Basel to Amsterdam, started at €13 (£9.40) for a 90-minute walking tour; a nine-tour package cost €220 (£159). On-board facilities include a massage room (€60/£43 for a 50-minute massage) and a gym. Two musicians, called Duo, played in the lounge before and after dinner, their repertoire ranging from rather indifferent Frank Sinatra covers to one or two lovely classical pieces. Dining room on board Amadeus Silver II The main dining room on board Food and drink 7/10 Breakfast was a buffet, while lunch and dinner were waiter service. Meals overall were good, with lots of choice, but the tastiest food was served at lunchtime in the lounge, where you could get soups and salads and pasta freshly cooked to order. A spicy Indonesian bami goreng (chicken, noodles and vegetables) was outstanding. As all passengers except myself and one couple were travelling in groups, tables were allocated for all meals. Free tea and coffee was available all day in the aft lounge. • The best river cruises for city breaks The restaurant staff could not do enough to look after us, but service was slow. Café Vienna did not live up to its name as it was just a sitting area in the upper atrium where rather uninspiring biscuits or cake were left out. The couple whose table I shared in the dining room were good company, but I am not a fan of assigned seating. An unspoken agreement; we avoided breakfast and lunch together so we had plenty to talk about at dinner. Value for money 8/10 Wi-Fi is included in the price for UK passengers. Once we had left Basle connectivity was sporadic. Amadeus Silver II is sailing seven- to 15-day itineraries on the Rhine and Danube; from £937pp including beer, wine and soft drinks with dinner, but excluding flights (01252 714477; amadeusrivercruises.co.uk ).
