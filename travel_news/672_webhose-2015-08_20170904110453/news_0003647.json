This year’s successful season of Aida saw around 20,000 tickets sold to people outside of Sydney – an increase of around 75 per cent on the previous year – a remarkable achievement.\n“The NSW Government, through its tourism and major events agency Destination NSW, partnered with Opera Australia in 2012 to establish Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour and we’re delighted to continue this partnership through to 2017.”\nOpera Australia Artistic Director, Lyndon Terracini AM, said Director Chen Shi-Zheng, will present a new vision for one of opera’s most loved works, with a huge cast, bold and exotic themes, big dance numbers and powerhouse voices including the biggest opera hit of all time, Nessun Dorma.\n“For some time I’ve wanted to work with Chen Shi-Zheng. His incredibly rigorous Chinese opera background combined with his work in the West has given him two worlds to draw upon. The result is a unique style, both spectacular and incredibly intense and powerful,” Mr Terracini said.\nDestination NSW Chief Executive Officer Sandra Chipchase welcomed the announcement and said, “Since 2012, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour has attracted an estimated 37,000 visitors from overseas, interstate and intrastate.”\nHanda Opera on Sydney Harbour: Turandot will run from 24 March 2016 until 24 April 2016.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:13:05.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
