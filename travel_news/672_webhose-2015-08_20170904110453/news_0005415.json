The survey gives an overall rating of 0-100, where one is intolerable and 100 is ideal.\n“The announcement is another well-deserved coup for South Australia and it recognises Adelaide’s recent transformation. Our city has definitely grown up,” Mr Bignell said.\n“From the redeveloped Adelaide Oval, Riverbank precinct and Convention Centre, to our small bar scene and laneways, there is immense interest in Adelaide right now.\n“Underpinning the recent CBD development is our low crime rate, something the State Government has worked tirelessly at improving in the past decade. Adelaide was also judged highly on our health and education facilities and services.\n“Our natural environment – being surrounded by beaches, hills, native vegetation and farming land – also makes Adelaide a wonderful place to visit and live.\n“Adelaide is a very special place in the world and it’s terrific to have an independent, international study to remind us to recognise and appreciate the many things we can sometimes take for granted.\n“The State Government is extremely committed to creating a vibrant city and with events like the Santos Tour Down Under, World Cup Cricket and AFL at the redeveloped Adelaide Oval, the Liverpool soccer match, Adelaide Fringe, Clipsal 500 Adelaide, Adelaide Festival and WOMADelaide, Adelaide just keeps gaining momentum.\n“Today’s announcement is another notch in the belt for Adelaide which has also previously been named in Lonely Planet’s Top 10 Cities in the world.”\nIn today’s report, Melbourne was named the most liveable city with Sydney coming seventh and Perth at eighth place. The report says the best scoring cities tend to be mid-sized cities in wealthier countries with a relatively low population density.\nDamascus in Syria was the lowest scoring city in the survey with a score of 29.3\nSource:- Tourism SA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:29:28.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
