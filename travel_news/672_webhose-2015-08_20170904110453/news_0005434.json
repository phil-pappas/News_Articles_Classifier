Hybrid electric cars are already a large business. Look at electric vehicles by land, water and air and you see a huge business growing rapidly and increasingly dominated by the electrics and electronics within these vehicles as it rises from about 40% to 70% in the coming decade. This report concerns power electronics for electric vehicles with the emphasis on the largest market, that for on-road vehicles, particularly cars and buses. It is intended for those seeking to invest, support, develop, make, sell or use power electronics and their components and associated services.\nIt will also assist those participating in the value chain of linked devices, such as batteries, supercapacitors, in-wheel systems, transmissions and electric motors, to understand the considerable opportunities for both collaborative use of their components and even merging with power electronics.\nThis 206 page report with 95 tables, figures and diagrams is unique in being mainly based on research in 2015 - the very latest. Only this report forecasts the key component, the traction motor inverter from 2014 to 2025 while discussing the full range of other power electronics. Coverage ranges from on board chargers to converters, battery management systems and power conditioning for the new multiple energy harvesting. Emphasis is on the present and future and distilled information with circuit diagrams and many ghost pictures of the vehicles showing layout. Ten year forecasts by numbers of no less than 37 EV categories are given. These are behind the rapid value market growth projected by IDTechEx of the traction inverter market for electric vehicles of $16 billion in 2014 leaping to $86 billion in 2025. Detailed assumptions behind all this are declared.\nThere are charts and tables explaining how the components interact, with trends identified, whether for pure electric, hybrid electric or fuel cell powertrains. A host of slides and 2015 poster displays from recent conferences in Japan , Taiwan , Korea, Germany and elsewhere clarify the very latest views of the participants such as Nissan, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Daimler but also thought leaders such as the researchers and Tier One suppliers. Original IDTechEx tables and infographics pull together the analysis. Only a global view makes sense in this subject.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3149057/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/power-electronics-for-electric-vehicles-2015-2025-300130780.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/power-electronics-for-electric-vehicles-2015-2025-300130780.html", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR82862&Transmission_Id=201508191302PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR82862&DateId=20150819", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3149057/"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:05:02.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
