People who run a business from their home may also have to pay business rates on any part of the building which is used solely for business purposes. In the past couple of years the government has run schemes reducing the amount that the smallest businesses need to pay. However, few people are happy with the present system. Shop owners say it puts them at an unfair disadvantage to online retailers who do not have shops to pay rates on. Others say it would be much fairer to levy the tax on actual sales rather than on the business premises, because this would more accurately reflect how well a business is doing. Others say that revaluing properties only once every five years does not fairly reflect changes in the economy. I’d welcome anything that makes running SMEs easier and allows us to invest in skills and talent The Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to overhaul the system by 2017 and in the past few weeks has received submissions from many interested parties, including retailers and local authorities, suggesting how the reforms should be carried out. His interim report has already highlighted three areas, which he plans to introduce practical reforms – a more efficient appeals system, better sharing of information by the Valuations Office Agency , which calculates the rateable value for business premises, and simpler billing and collection. However, business owners fear that the eventual reforms may not go far enough because the Chancellor has already said the reforms will be fiscally neutral, meaning that the total amount currently generated by business rates – around £19bn a year – will not change. This, they say, will limit his ability to introduce any major changes. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called on the Government to create a “simple, fair and competitive” system which carries out more frequent property valuations in order to better reflect the changing economic environment, and which will raise rates in line with the consumer price index instead of the retail price index to ensure that business rates do not rise faster than inflation. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) meanwhile fears that now the Government has won the election, it may be less committed to seeing the review through. It has called on the Conservatives to make the review a top priority, saying there is an urgent need for the Government to clarify its position by setting out a detailed timetable. Mike Cullis is managing director at creative direct marketing agency Soul. He says: “Reports in March promised a radical rates review, and the post-election Budget confirmed it remains in plan. Yet with findings not due until the 2016 Budget, for impact in 2017, we remain in the dark. And with an outcome that’s forecast to be fiscally neutral, I question how much the eventual reforms will benefit smaller businesses.” He adds: “The Government talks a great deal about the economic importance of entrepreneurs and SMEs, and a change to business rates has the potential to remove barriers to new start-ups and investment in business growth. \"As an SME in the creative sector, operating in London, we still need office space and are hit hard by fast-rising annual rents – with rates calculated against annual rental value, it's a double hit on overheads. There tends to be a six-month deposit requirement too.” “I’d welcome anything that makes running SMEs easier and allows us to invest in skills and talent instead of worrying about ever-increasing overheads. Caps on business rates would be a good start.” • One way to support your business through change is with the right company car, financed the best way for your business.
