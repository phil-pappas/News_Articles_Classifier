'Quite sombre' \nEyewitnesses have been recalling seeing the plane fall and the subsequent explosions. \nArchie Tipple, a spectator at the event, said the mood changed very quickly when people realised what happened. \n\"I was photographing the aircraft as it started its display and as it climbed and climbed and climbed I thought, this is pretty good. \n\"..but he was coming in a little bit low and I was still photographing it as it came down and then all of a sudden you just knew what was coming, and it just immediately changed, the atmosphere, from a festive one to something quite sombre,\" he said. Supt Jane Derrick (second left) was joined at a press conference by Nick Bunting from the Royal Air Forces Association, Mark Bailey from South East Coast Ambulance Service and Gavin Watts from West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service \nShoreham resident Dave Penwarden, 51, said he saw the plane explode. \n\"It just didn't seem to have enough speed to come out of the loop, instead of powering out it dropped too fast and hit the ground. \n\"There was a massive fireball and an awful lot of smoke. Afterwards there was a stunned silence.\" \nTim Loughton MP, who represents East Worthing and Shoreham, tweeted : \"Tragic news that there have been fatalities at the Shoreham Air Show crash and our thoughts and prayers must be with the families and casualties.\" \nIt is the second incident at the Shoreham Airshow, one of the premier airshows in the UK, in recent years. \nIn September 2007 James Bond stuntman Brian Brown, 49, died when he crashed a World War Two Hurricane after carrying out an unplanned barrel roll at a re-enactment of the Battle of Britain. Hawker Hunter The Hawker Hunter flew over crowds during the display at Shoreham Airshow \nThe Hawker Hunter was a mainstay of the RAF through the 1950s and early 1960s. \nFirst flown in 1951, the single-seat plane was used as a fighter, fighter-bomber for reconnaissance and for aerobatics. \nThere was also a two-seat trainer version, which served with many other air forces. Two-seater variants are still used by the RAF for training. \nThe Hawker Hunter was deployed in major operations such as Malaya and Suez. \nThe plane was also flown by an RAF display team dubbed the \"Black Arrows\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T00:42:49.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
