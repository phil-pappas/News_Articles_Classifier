Media in both shows aim to show an individual’s image, of course, but they also raise the question: How does the viewer come to understand a subject? Is a “living portrait” of Bob Dylan (shown here, “Andy Warhol, Screen Test: Bob Dylan [ST83],” 1966) any more illuminating than the somber 1895 oil of “The Stoker,” by Robert Henri (also shown here) — a prime example of late-20th-century efforts to depict “real life”? The Frye is open 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesdays-Sundays, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Thursdays, 704 Terry Ave., Seattle; free (206-622-9250 or fryemuseum.org ).\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:25:53.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
