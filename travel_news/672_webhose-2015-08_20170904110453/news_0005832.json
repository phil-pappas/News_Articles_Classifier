Local officials said none had been reported.\n“There have been no CRE infections at any VA facility, according to the National Office of Sterile Processing,” Chad Hutson, a spokesman for the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, said in a March 4 email, noting he was referring to local sites.\nA patient-safety advocate and prominent critic of the scopes called the VA report “a bombshell” in light of the agency’s previous position.\n“The VA’s statement raises questions about what the VA knew and when they knew it,” said Lawrence F. Muscarella, a Philadelphia expert on contaminated duodenoscopes.\nThe new analysis of nearly 56,000 procedures in more than 40,000 veterans between January 2010 and February 2015 detected nearly 5,000 CRE isolates in 2,300 patients.\nDuring that time, 97 patients who were treated with the specialized medical scopes at 39 VA centers were infected with at least one CRE isolate, the report found. Twenty patients had the infections before the procedures.\nThe patients received either ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or EUS, endoscopic ultrasonography, procedures that diagnose and treat problems of the pancreas, bile ducts and liver. Nearly 700,000 ERCP procedures are performed in the U.S. each year.\n“It was unclear whether their CRE infection was due to their duodenoscopy procedure,” the report said.\nAt 17 VA medical centers, a single patient who underwent the procedures tested positive for CRE, which officials said likely indicated little chance it was spread by a tainted scope.\n“We cannot definitively rule out the possibility that these patients developed their infection as a result of their procedure, however, as there were no additional patients found at these sites, there was not a clear linkage to a duodenoscopy procedure,” the report said.\nBut at 22 other VA centers, multiple patients who received ERCP/EUS developed CRE infections. At eight centers, 42 patient pairs were reported to have had procedures within six months of each other at the same site, and both tested positive for the same germ.\nAfter review, 36 pairs were ruled out because the device serial numbers and models didn’t match, the cases were miscoded or patients didn’t actually receive treatment in the same location.\nThat left a half-dozen in which infections could have been linked to contaminated scopes.\n“There were six pairs that we could not completely rule out the possibility of transmission,” the report found.\nFor three of those, the scope models and serial numbers were not available, and officials were unable to determine whether the patients had been exposed to the same duodenoscope. In the other three pairs, the same scope was used.\nHowever, the scopes were also used on other patients in the interim, without incident, the report found. “Thus, transmission of CRE within these pairs appears highly unlikely,” officials concluded.\nThere were several limitations to the report, including uncertainty over whether all VA centers were correctly identifying CRE, inability to use molecular fingerprinting to determine whether patients were infected with the same strain of bacteria, and lack of consistency in identifying the make and model of the scopes. The review was limited to patients with CRE detected at VA sites; patients with infections diagnosed elsewhere might not have been identified.\nThe VA launched an investigation this past spring into about 150 medical centers and associated sites after reports of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant infections at hospitals in Seattle, Los Angeles and elsewhere tied to the scopes. Health officials determined that the devices could not be cleaned even after medical staff followed manufacturers’ directions.\nVA officials did not disclose the locations of the 39 medical centers with CRE-infected patients. But Hutson, spokesman for the Puget Sound center, said no infections tied to ERCP have been reported at that site.\nThe federal Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidelines aimed at helping hospitals prevent the spread of infections by contaminated scopes. Last week, the FDA issued additional guidelines, while also acknowledging that it might be impossible to clean the scopes as they’re designed.\nSeveral patients locally and nationwide, and Virginia Mason officials, are suing one of the leading manufacturers of the scopes, Olympus America.\nDr. Andrew Ross, head of gastroenterology at Virginia Mason, has said his hospital had to implement a $1 million “test-and-hold” program to stop the local outbreak linked to 39 infections, including 18 deaths, between 2012 and 2014.\nFDA officials and now VA officials have said that the risk of contracting deadly infections is low. FDA officials say that the benefits of using the duodenoscopes outweigh those risks, and that they’re lifesaving procedures in people who need them.\nBut Muscarella noted that the VA report is more evidence that there could be more potentially deadly infections tied to the devices than suspected.\n“In fact, it is possible that the risk of CRE infections following ERCP is relatively high,” he said.\nJoNel Aleccia: 206-464-2906 or jaleccia@seattletimes.com .
