That has led some to argue that the Sun, rather than the burning of fossil fuels, has been the main driver of rising global temperatures,\nNEWS: How Sun Changed Europe’s Climate in the Past\nBut deniers will have a tougher time making the case now. The solar explanation for global warming is refuted by a new study just presented at the International Astronomical Union’s annual assembly in Hawaii, which fixes a discrepancy among historical records of sunspots.\nThe apparent upward trend of solar activity between the 18th century and the late 20th century has now been identified as a major calibration error in the Group Sunspot Number, one of the two systems for counting sunspot activity historically. (The other is the Wolf Sunspot Number.)\nBut now that the error has been fixed, scientists say that solar activity actually has remained relatively stable since the 1700s. That means that although fluctuations in solar weather can influence climate over shorter periods, the long-term trend is being caused by something else.\nNEWS: Why Has the Sun Gone So Quiet?\nThe Wolf system, which was developed back in 1856, is the oldest time series in solar terrestrial physics that’s still in use today. It counts both individual sunspots and sunspot groups. But in the mid-1990s, scientists began to question whether it was an accurate way to reconstruct the longer history of solar activity. In 1998, the Group Sunspot Number, a new index, was established. It was based in part based on sunspot measurements made by Galileo in 1612.\nBut the two scales disagreed roughly before 1885, and the GSN suggests a rise in solar activity until the late 20th Century, which the Wolf system doesn’t. But the new analysis shows that it actually was the GSN that was incorrect.\nThe study was conducted by researchers in the United States, Germany and Belgium.\nTags Current Affairs Current Events Climate and Weather Climate Change Global Warming Sun Earth ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1508/", "http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/sunspot_drawings.html", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/SunspotCycle.shtml", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum", "http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100102296/sun-causes-climate-change-shock/", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2"], "published": "2015-08-11T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:26:43.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
