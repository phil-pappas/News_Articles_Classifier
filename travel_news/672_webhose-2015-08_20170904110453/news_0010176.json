This year it was 860, a significant increase from an average gathering of 700 of the past few years.\n“We asked for a show of hands of first-time visitors to Portland,” said Roger Dow, president U.S. Travel Association, the Washington, D.C.-based trade organization that staged the conference. “It was about 75 percent. They will go back home, talk about where they went and spread the word.”\nTravel and tourism has been riding high in the United States and Oregon since 2011. Times were tough the decade before, with the double whammy of the terrorist attacks on passenger airplanes in 2001 and the stock market crash in 2008.\nHaving travel pros in town will continue to boost Portland and Oregon tourism, though maybe these convention attendees flew more under the radar than a recent coffee-based convention. It seems the dozens of Brazilians who signed up for that one made quite an impression while they increased their knowledge of Oregon’s other drinks by visiting wineries and breweries.\nLast year saw the direct spending of $928 billion on travel and tourism in the United State, according to Dow. That had a $2.1 trillion impact on the economy with its ripple effect through the butchers, bakers and sign makers, he added, while noting that 15 million jobs are dependent on the travel and hospitality service industries.\nDomestic travel grew 2 percent last year, with 1.4 percent growth in spending. International travel jumped 3.7 percent, with 6.7 percent growth in spending.\nThe biggest growth has been in visitors from China: a half-million in 2009, to 2.2 million last year, with 4.5 million forecast in 2017 and 7 million in 2020. Easing the way has been China’s recent adoption of a visa valid for 10 years for its citizens, instead of requiring them to reapply for each trip. Dow said travel from India is charting a similar course.\nAnother boom has been with visitors from South Korea, which increased 53 percent in three years after the U.S. adopted a visa waiver policy in 2008. The U.S. waives visa requirements for travellers from 38 countries, up from 27 six years ago. Visitors from those countries need only a passport to enter the United States. Security is still a priority, though it is done in the background, without the inconvenience of applying for a visa.\nA recent change in travel policy was to allow Canadians to stay 240 consecutive days south of the border, up from 180, which affected the market for second houses. The number of international visitors is expected to grow from 60 million last year to 100 million in 2021, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\nTravel USA has a proposal to fund future airport improvements by increasing the passenger facility charge from $4.50 to $8.50, with airport discretion on the amount of the increase. The price increase would be fully offset by reducing five types of federal taxes on air tickets. The increase would be kept locally for defined upgrades at airports where it is collected, under the U.S. Travel Association proposal.\nWith the increase in international tourism, Dow said the famous Wednesday before Thanksgiving at U.S. airports will be happening on average around the country one day each week year round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:47:32.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
