The 50 states – particularly those in the west – offer some of the most fabulous walking terrain on the planet. But with vast distances involved, you need a trusted partner to guide you. With Ramblers Worldwide Holidays you can enjoy a holiday that is both invigorating and outstanding, with excursions that will inspire and astound. Ramblers Worldwide Holidays' experienced and knowledgeable leaders love to give their guests an authentic flavour of the nation, leading you away from the more well-trodden tourist paths. Walking holidays from Ramblers Worldwide Holidays range from vigorous countryside hikes to gentle strolls in cultural centres – and the rewards are as immense as the country itself. The south-west boasts some of the most dramatic rock formations and vistas on the planet. On Ramblers Worldwide Holidays' Canyonlands itinerary you can experience this awe-inspiring majesty for yourself. From Las Vegas, you’ll take a circular route through Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Colorado; an enthralling journey featuring scenic panoramas and geological wonders that gives you the chance to discover more about Native American history. Nothing can prepare you for the reality of being at the legendary Grand Canyon You’ll visit three of the great National Parks of Utah – Zion Canyon, Bryce Canyon and Arches. Marvel at Zion Canyon’s Emerald Pools, waterfalls and spectacular sandstone gorge; gaze at Bryce Canyon’s surreal red, yellow, white and flaming orange rock formations; and explore Arches’ natural bridges of smoky red sandstone – more than 2,000 of them in all shapes and sizes, including the 98ft-high Landscape Arch and lesser-known but equally enthralling Double O Arch. The journey continues to the Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, where you’ll hike through the ruins of the Pueblo Indian civilisation. And after a drive through Monument Valley to see the stunning buttes of the Navajo nation, you’ll come to the legendary Grand Canyon – a mile deep and up to 18 miles wide. As your leader will no doubt tell you, nothing can prepare you for the reality of being there – especially as the approach through pine woods gives you no indication of what lies beyond. Over three days, you’ll walk to spectacular overlooks and make forays down into the canyon itself. After spending a night on the canyon floor at Phantom Ranch, on the Colorado River, there’s a chance to climb up to the North Rim – a challenging ascent that will give you an unforgettable experience of the magnitude of this extraordinary geology. Even though this is an above-grade walk, it is well worth the extra effort. If you choose not to descend into the canyon, you can spend another day on the South Rim. Your final night will be in buzzing Las Vegas, whose attractions will provide a stark but entertaining contrast to the natural wonders you have just witnessed. Whether you choose to hike the Canyonlands or take a city stroll in the Big Apple, with Ramblers Worldwide Holidays you can explore the US at your own pace and discover the grandeur and freedom of this incredible land of dreams with experts to guide you. • Find advice, rewards and a brochure at Ramblers Worldwide Holidays or simply call an expert on 01707 331133", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:18:03.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
