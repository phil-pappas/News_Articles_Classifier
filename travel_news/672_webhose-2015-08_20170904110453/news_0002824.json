The Boeing aircraft is currently the longest-range aircraft in the world, with a range of 8,555 nautical miles according to Boeing’s website. This distance capability will be superseded by Boeing’s 777-8X jet, which is rated at 8,700 nautical miles. Emirates configures the two-engine wide-body 777 200LR (Long range) for 266 seats. The 200LR is powered for distance, using the same 115,000-pound thrust engines as the larger 777 300, but pushing 33 feet less fuselage length. The new route will connect Emirates’ hub in Dubai with Panama City as a hub for Central America. A Bloomberg story estimated the distance at 8,590 miles . “Panama City will be our first destination gateway in Central America, providing a convenient option for our passengers traveling from or through our global hub in Dubai and onward to destinations throughout Central America, the Caribbean and the northern part of South America,” said His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum , chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline & Group, in a statement.
