I think we can never do… more In Jack Lemmon ’s new office in the Broadway Theatre Center hangs a chandelier that provides one of the room’s only sources of light. The fixture looming over Lemmon’s desk in the offices of the Skylight Music Theatre isn’t a reflection of the personal tastes of the office’s previous occupant. It’s a former theater prop recycled for practical use — because that’s what nonprofit performing arts organizations do to save money. But Lemmon, now the Skylight Music Theatre’s executive director, suggests the chandelier is about to go. And he won’t stop with a little office remodeling. Lemmon has eyes on remaking the entire Skylight organization and what it means to the community. “I think we need to strip us back to the studs,” Lemmon said in laying out his first goal for the 3rd Ward music theater company — redefining the Skylight. That means building consensus among community, staff and board members as to what the Skylight needs to be, he said. That Lemmon employs construction terminology is fitting. Part of what needs to be determined over the course of reassessing the Skylight’s position is how it will address a number of deferred maintenance issues for the Broadway Theatre Center, its building in Milwaukee’s historic 3rd Ward neighborhood. The cost of addressing those issues is likely in the seven figures. What won’t change is the company’s level of artistic achievement. The Skylight continues to produce high-quality and groundbreaking work under the guidance of artistic director Viswa Subbaraman . “We do extraordinary work on stage in a whole plethora of genres,” Lemmon said, noting that the range of the company’s work runs from traditional opera to Broadway-style musicals and even music revues. The key problem is that Milwaukee audiences do not appear to be as aware of that level of quality as theater communities in other parts of the country, said Alec Fraser , president of the Skylight board. “The Skylight’s reputation outside of Milwaukee is really stronger and more well-known than it is in Milwaukee,” Fraser said. That’s reflected in the fact that the majority of the dozens of applicants received for the managing director position vacated by Amy Jensen earlier this year came from outside the Milwaukee area. Vast experience Lemmon was one of those many national applicants. What made his resume stand out was a lengthy list of nonprofit management positions in the arts, including leadership of the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago and the Colorado Ballet in Denver. “Jack has an entire career full of managing performing arts organizations,” Fraser said. That experience, Fraser said, has made Lemmon very good at managing organizations with financial challenges such as the Skylight’s. Lemmon’s experience starts with his Midwest roots. He was born in Deerfield, Ill., but he spent most of his childhood in small town Grand Junction, Colo. He earned an undergraduate degree in arts, playing the trumpet, from Coe College in Iowa. He began his career as a band music teacher, but became frustrated with how the arts always seemed to take a back seat to the sports programs at the schools. An arts administration class during his senior year in college opened Lemmon’s eyes to an alternative. He pursued and received a master’s degree in arts administration from the University of Utah and embarked on a career in administration that took him to all corners of the country. One of those stops included the Louisville Ballet , which was in dire financial straits when Lemmon became executive director in 2002. Under Lemmon’s leadership, the organization overhauled its marketing strategies with an edgier approach and took bolder steps on stage with programming that broadened its appeal with younger audiences and re-energized existing audiences, according to Louisville (Ky.) news reports. In three years, the Louisville Ballet emerged a much-stronger organization. The Skylight Music Theatre may not have to rise from the same depths that the Louisville Ballet had faced, but it still faces a relatively new challenge: competition. At one time, there were few performing arts organizations dedicated to the range of music theater upon which the Skylight built its reputation. Now, other options have muscled in on its space: the Broadway Series at the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts and the new musical offerings at the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, for example. Even the Florentine Opera is beginning to broaden its range of musical theater work. In a way, the Skylight is being challenged by the strength of the community it calls home. “Milwaukee arts are very broad,” Lemmon said of his first impressions of the city. “You don’t always see it in a city of this size.” The process of reassessing the Skylight will likely take a couple of years, Lemmon said. Whatever the outcome of that assessment, it’s clear Lemmon wants to ensure that the community benefits. “We have to serve the community where we reside,” he said. “I think we can never do enough. We know we can make a difference.” JACK LEMMON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:46:20.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
