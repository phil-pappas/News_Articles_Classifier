The service will end January 5, 2016. According to The Street, the route lost more than $20 million this year alone . This means that the world’s largest airline will no longer fly to Israel and Philadelphia loses a key international direct flight. American said customers can still access Tel Aviv through its joint partnership with British Airways with a layover in London or through a codeshare relationship with El Al via various European gateways. SBA assumes assets of local venture capital firm When the service began in 2009, it was viewed as a sign of Philadelphia becoming more of an international hub for US Airways, which merged into American in 2013. The Philadelphia-Israel Chamber of Commerce had said the route was crowded with passengers. The office of Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the decision may be viewed as shortsighted as more Israeli businesses express interest in Philadelphia. “Indeed, we are now seeing a trend where Israeli firms have decided to locate their operations in Philadelphia,” the mayor’s office told the Inquirer. “[Halting the flights] sends the wrong message about our city and region as an open and business friendly locale and damages American Airlines reputation as an international business.” Nutter has made two trips to Israel — fall 2013 and last month — as several Israeli technology firms have eyed Philadelphia for their U.S. headquarters location. \nGet Philadelphia Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:46:19.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
