Although it is a separate company from United Airlines, United Ground Express will align with United’s flyer friendly customer service philosophy. United Ground Express recently began recruiting to place qualified applicants in available positions and launched a new website with additional information, unitedgroundexpress.com.\n“We are launching United Ground Express to provide flyer friendly service to travelers in more airports throughout North America,” said Lynda Coffman, president of United Ground Express. “Additionally, we look forward to providing exciting job opportunities and creating diverse and inclusive work environments in the communities that we’ll serve.”\nUnited Ground Express will provide airport ground handling services – including customer service, station operations, and ramp and cargo services – at select airports around United’s domestic system. At airports with United Express service, the new subsidiary will further enable United to provide its customers with a travel experience that’s closely aligned with its mainline service.\nUnited Ground Express will begin service this fall at select stations, and will also provide ground handling for United’s new service to and from Kalamazoo, Michigan, starting Dec. 9.\nSource:- United Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:24:18.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
