The trail and surrounding area have been closed to the public until further notice. \nCampbell said the man carried no pack or bear spray and did not disclose his plans to anyone. \nBruising around puncture wounds on the man's forearms suggested he had tried to defend himself, Campbell said. \nInformation from: Jackson Hole (Wyo.)
