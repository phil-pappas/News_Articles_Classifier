Complementing the previously launched MICHELIN ® X ® Multi™ Energy D drive tire, the SmartWay ® -verified retread is guaranteed to deliver 25 percent longer tread life than competitive retreads, while providing exceptional fuel efficiency and scrub resistance in regional applications. The MICHELIN X Multi Energy D retread is also guaranteed for a second retread when retreaded on a MICHELIN ® casing (MICHELIN on MICHELIN) by Michelin Retread Technologies (MRT) dealers.\n\"With shorter routes trending in the trucking industry, customers are looking for tires and retreads that can handle mixed highway and regional use,\" said Bianca Hogan , U.S. marketing director for Michelin Americas Truck Tires. \"The new MICHELIN X Multi Energy D Pre-Mold retread complements our new tire offering in meeting those needs and performs especially well in 4x2 applications.\"\nThe MICHELIN X Multi Energy D Pre-Mold retread features a dual energy compound. The top layer provides exceptional removal mileage. The bottom layer allows the tread to run cool, minimizing internal casing temperatures for low rolling resistance and extended casing life. It also comes with Michelin's inter-locking Matrix™ Siping, which offers excellent traction and even wear. The retread is available in three tread widths: 220, 230 and 240 – all with 21/32\" tread depth.\nAbout Michelin\nDedicated to the improvement of sustainable mobility, Michelin designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.
