On his walls hang broad mounted antlers, trophies of a lifetime of deer hunting in the Tatra mountains, the highest in Eastern Europe's Carpathian range. In the kitchen, with its traditional tile stove, his wife, Maria, prepares a snack of blueberry juice and homemade cheese from a milking goat brought in each night for protection from bears and wolves.\nMy wife and I are visiting the Spis region in northeastern Slovakia, which is, for her, the \"old country.\" Raised on a farm in southern Ontario, Annie spoke only Slovak until she reached school age and had to learn English. This makes the trip a special occasion: returning to her roots, getting to know her Slovak relatives, and discovering the rich culture, stunning traditional architecture, and spectacular landscape that her parents and grandparents left behind when they emigrated - part of an exodus from poverty and persecution that began in the late 19th century.\nThe majority headed for grueling jobs in the mines and mills of Pennsylvania, which today has more people of Slovak heritage than any other state. One of Annie's grandfathers spent two stints in his younger days working there before making his way with his family to Canada.\nOur hosts, the Filip family, take us by car on daylong outings through the Spis region, to towns and sites of historic and personal interest. In the foothills, the lush, rolling countryside is planted in canola, maize, and barley. Narrow country roads are lined with evenly spaced apple trees. To the northwest, the serrated peaks of the High Tatras are always in view.\nMore coverage TOURING SLOVAKIA'S SPIS REGION Mapuche indigenous culture thrives in Chile and abroad South Korean 'love hotels' clean up act to woo youthful clients We clamber through the ruins of enormous Spis castle, built in the 12th century on a stark hilltop already occupied at the time of Christ by migrating Celts. The thick stone walls withstood even Mongol attacks. By the 16th century, they enclosed a residential palace of powerful Hungarian aristocrats. Ownership changed under the Austrian Habsburgs, and eventually a fire destroyed everything made of wood. What remained was abandoned to the elements.\nAs we leave, dark clouds sweep in. Rain pelts down and lightning flashes over the looming castle. It is easy to imagine a Shakespearean character like Hamlet pacing the high battlements, tormented by his thoughts.\nA wonderful surprise is the lovely walled town of Levoca, a former royal city and cultural center of the Slovak national Enlightenment in the late 18th century. Arched gateways and streets are lined with medieval buildings in pastel colors. Among its landmarks are the 14th-century St. James Church, with the highest wooden altar in Europe; the 18th-century theater; the multi-columned 19th-century town hall; and the open-air \"shaming cage,\" where transgressors were publicly punished. A basilica and field on a nearby hill is a traditional pilgrimage site where Pope John Paul II once celebrated mass for more than 600,000.\nThe Filips have often attended the masses there, and they appreciate the religious freedom they have enjoyed since Communism ended barely two decades ago. The oldest child, Robert, tells us how Stalin ordered the church crushed. In the 1950s, police raided the monasteries and convents and threw most priests and nuns into prison camps.\nRobert himself felt the oppression as a high school student near the end of the Communist period, when church attendance was still discouraged. Openly practicing his faith could hurt his chances of going to a university and having a successful career, he was warned. But then came the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the nonviolent overthrow of Czechoslovakia's Communist government, and with it, the independence of predominantly Catholic Slovakia.\nOne Sunday morning, we watch as a stream of proud parents, decked out in their finery, lead their children to the local church in elegant white robes and muster them for a procession and their first communion.\nBitter memories remain, however. In one village, a memorial refers to an uprising against the Nazis near the end of World War II, and we discuss the subsequent postwar occupation. It's pure myth, Robert says, that the Soviets were liberators.\nHe tells us how Russian soldiers dragged his grandmother by her long braid into the kitchen and demanded food. Rape and pillage were commonplace. Nor have most Slovaks forgotten how Soviet forces crushed a more liberal form of socialism in 1968, in what was still Czechoslovakia. The leader at the time, Alexander Dubcek, was himself a Slovak and held reformist ideas said to have inspired Mikhail Gorbachev. Gejza, Robert's father, adds simply that the Russians behaved like barbarians.\nWe visit an elderly relative who lives in a tiny village and wears the black shawl and somber dress of mourning. A closer look reveals that, although dark, the fabrics and stitching are incredibly ornate. Opening her closet, she displays her extensive wardrobe and admits a bit sheepishly that women like to appear in church in the finest and most elegant clothes. And she has sewn everything herself, all her life. She takes us to the cemetery and shows us the grave of Annie's great-grandmother, which she regularly tends with flowers and devotion.\nWe also spend glorious days in the High Tatra mountains, riding a funicular railway up into Tatra National Park and hiking through the forest of red spruce to a remote waterfall on a major stream. Thunderous water spirals into deep gurgling holes as we sit on a gigantic, weathered boulder and enjoy a picnic. There are no mosquitoes to spoil things, even in early June.\nAnother time, the entire family soars in a dizzying cable car, passing the tree line en route to a barren peak. It is a poignant moment for the Filips. As a young man, Gejza climbed this mountain in city shoes, carrying a valise, to collect the needles of a rare high-elevation evergreen shrub called kosodrevina, mountain or mugo pine. A doctor had told his wife, Terezia, that she could never have children, but a folk remedy offered an alternative. She soaked in hot baths infused with the needles. The resulting three children (son Robert was followed by daughters Julia and Maria) seem to indicate that it worked, but they had never been up the mountain or seen the shrubs, which spread below us in a broad swath.\nThe Tatra region is known for its enchanting alpine villages. Log-built and chalet-style houses feature large balconies, colorful window shutters, and other fanciful and ornate woodwork. There are centuries-old wooden churches and attractive, affordable boutique hotels popular in summer with hikers, campers, and lovers of wildlife. In winter, they host skiers from all over Europe. We spend a night in one of them, in a romantic top-floor room with dormers, and eat in a restaurant that serves local wild game and freshly caught fish from the lakes and streams.\nMost evenings, though, Terezia pampers us with her Slovak home cooking - a rich cuisine that starts with tasty soups and moves on to pork or chicken main dishes, plus potatoes from their large garden, or pierogi, or dumplings with butter or gravy. Then comes dessert. They say that if you don't gain weight while visiting Slovakia, you have not been treated to true Slovak hospitality. And so we do.\nOur final day, we visit Michlik, the carver and instrument maker, a longtime friend of the Filips, who has been featured in documentaries on Slovak national television and played his stringed instruments in a local folk music group. In his village, Zdiar, people speak a dialect, Goral, that is closer to Polish than to Slovak, a vestige of centuries of Polish rule over the region.\nHe regales us with stories about his life. For many years, he was part of a hunting club with access to some of Europe's most pristine alpine wilderness, where boar, lynx, and mountain goat still run free. During the Communist period, he supplemented his carving income by keeping sheep and renting out rooms, mainly to tourists from East Germany.\nHe takes us through his workshop, where antique hand tools coexist with a modern lathe and bandsaw. His latest violin, and its ornately carved wooden case, will be an 18th birthday present for his granddaughter. We see racks of carefully stacked wood that has to air dry for three to five years. Most of it is now earmarked for his grandson, Marek, who apprenticed under him and is carrying on the proud tradition.\nWe hate to leave Slovakia, but at least we have a special souvenir. A framed bas-relief of the Tatras, carved in pale linden wood by Marek Michlik and a gift from the Filips, graces our living room wall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T01:44:47.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
