WorldVentures received its ranking based on growth of 491% in the past three years.\nThe list represents one of the most important segments of the economy—America’s independent entrepreneurs. Companies such as Yelp, Pandora, Timberland, Dell, Domino’s Pizza, LinkedIn, Zillow, and many other prominent businesses, gained early exposure as members of the Inc. 5000.\n“We’re honored to be named to the fastest-growing companies list once again,” WorldVentures Co-founder and Chief Visionary Officer Wayne Nugent said. “We’ve catapulted from 2333 last year to number 915 this year and rank ninth for the top travel and hospitality companies. What a great achievement for our corporate team and Independent Representatives around the world who have worked so hard to deliver these results.”\nThe 2015 Inc. 5000, unveiled online at Inc.com is the most competitive crop in the list’s history. The average company on the list achieved an impressive three-year growth of 490%. The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue is $205 billion, generating 647,000 jobs over the past three years.\n“The story of this year’s Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership,” Inc. President and Editor-in-Chief Eric Schurenberg said. “In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top. You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012. Business owners don’t achieve that kind of success by accident.”\nThis recognition comes at a time of tremendous growth for WorldVentures. In addition to the being named one of America’s fastest-growing private companies in the Inc. 5000 list, WorldVentures was recognized at No. 47 on the Direct Selling News’ DSN Global 100 list and No. 25 on the DSN North America 50 list.
