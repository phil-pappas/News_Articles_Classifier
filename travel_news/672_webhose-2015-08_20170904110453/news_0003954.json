American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) is giving Chicago the Dreamliner treatment. Starting tomorrow, the world's largest airline will introduce the Boeing 787 Dreamliner on nonstop service between Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , AA's second largest hub, and Tokyo's Narita International Airport. The introduction of the Dreamliner service on the route coincides with AA's move to offer daily service between ORD and NRT, up from the five flights weekly on the route previously. AA's new Dreamliner service on its Tokyo route makes the airline one of just three carriers using the relatively-new aircraft on regularly-scheduled service from Chicago. LOT Polish Airlines was first to introduce the 787 at O'Hare in mid-2013. Late last year Royal Jordanian Airlines also began exclusively using the 787 on flights between O'Hare and Amman, Jordan. Chicago-based United Airlines uses the 787 on routes from other markets, but has yet to put the Dreamliner into regular service on any routes from its largest hub at O'Hare. American Airlines' debut of the 787 at O'Hare is part of a concerted push by the world's largest carrier and its aggressive CEO Doug Parker to significantly upgrade its fleet on both domestic and international routes. O'Hare becomes the first AA hub beyond Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport to get the carrier's 787. AA already has introduced the 787 on three routes from DFW to Buenos Aires, Beijing and Shanghai. The AA 787s operating between O'Hare and Tokyo Narita will be equipped with 28 flatbed seats in the business cabin, 48 main cabin extra seats with additional legroom and 150 regular economy cabin seats in a 3-3-3 configuration. \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
