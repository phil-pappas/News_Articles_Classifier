It’s more tumultuous and thrilling, but the Niueans are everything you’d want in laid-back friendliness LIZ LIGHT Last updated 05:00, August 18 2015 Liz Light \nDancing displays at Lakepa Village include all age groups; the marvellous array of handicrafts at Lakepa Show. \nIt's Show Day at village. The road across the middle of Niue Island passes through tropical rain forest with crowns of giant mahogany standing tall and taro gardens tucked into cleared patches. Soon we become part of a convoy, 12 cars in a row ambling along at 40kph. If feels as if we are in a funeral procession but, no, driving here is always slow-lane. \nMost of Niue's 1500 inhabitants have gathered at Lakepa for the show. The village square is circled with stalls selling food and the locals are enjoying Saturday brunch: barbecued chicken, corned beef and taro stew, taro cooked in coconut cream, coconut-crab soup and, for afters, great slabs of chocolate cake sprinkled with hundreds and thousands. \nMeanwhile, the judges are busy. In the agricultural area three experts make their way along rows of vegetables, primarily taro, kumara and yams. They weigh each entry on bathroom scales, assess the shape and note down details. Uga (coconut crabs), large blue-black creatures, are bound with string so they don't scuttle off, but they wave their nippers. Uga are judged on size and colour, their last chance for glory before the pot. Liz Light \nTumultuous waves smash onto Niue’s south coast in an endless display of power and energy. \nNearby, handicraft judging is underway. Weaving, for which Niue is famous, covers tables. Hats, baskets, table mats and fans come in all shapes, sizes and styles. Embroidered pillow cases are another highly competitive category – usually white cotton gorgeously decorated with bright floral patterns. \nBy 10am the judging is finished, the crowd is happily satiated and the food stalls are empty. The spear-throwing competition begins. The pointy ends of the spears have been blunted with taped-on bunting, with good reason as some bounce sideways on landing and veer off into the crowd. There are heats and different age categories; some of the old men, once warriors, have kept their thrusting ability and some of the young lads have impressive muscles but not the necessary technique. A man in his middle years, built like a boxer, consistently throws his spear furthest and is declared the winner. \nThen it's dancing time. A three-year-old boy opens the programme with a war dance and chant – he's so cute the entire crowd is cooing . With music thumping, different groups from Lakepa Primary School present dance routines. The children wear matching parus and hair decorations and, despite a few littlies losing the beat, all goes well. When the children finish, young women dance with restraint and elegance and, despite being clothed from chest to ankle – no jiggling coconut shells here – their movements are exquisitely sensual. Liz Light \nThree massive rock formations make up the Talava Arches on the northern coast. \nAt the Lakepa Show wraps up and we join the slow cavalcade of cars crossing the island to Alofi, Niue's capital. It's the biggest town with the Assembly Building, the market, shops, banks and most of the restaurants. It is, probably, the only capital where a hen with chicks lives in the central square, happily clucking and pecking for grubs in the grass. \nThe market is held on Tuesdays and Fridays and when I roll up at 6.30am it's buzzing with locals, even though it's still dark. It's livened-up by a big ghetto blaster playing 1970s' pop near the entrance. I cruise the fresh vegetables: bunches of taro, bundles of fern shoots, silver beet . I buy pitako , a mix of ground taro, tapioca and coconut cream steamed in a taro leaf. It's a high-calorie treat astride the line between sweet and savoury. \nI resist pineapple pie and pancakes but buy a bag of small, made-this-morning doughnuts and eat them while I roam. Liz Light \nAvaiki Cave, vast and cathedral-like, has a rock pool that’s ideal for swimming. \nAt the handicraft stall I meet Fisimoka Poihega, president of the market, Mrs Niue 1988, now aged 78. Her lesson to me is that age and isolation need not affect appearance. She is beautiful and goes to some trouble to remain so with red lippy, eyebrows pencilled in arches and long white hair neatly fixed in a fancy do. I buy two table mats from her but want four more. No problem. She is on the phone and Anna arrives half an hour later with more mats. Ad Feedback \nThere is a sweet social ambience at the market, lots of hugs, kisses and hand shaking as people meet and greet, come and go. Then it is all over, the ghetto blaster packed away, and Fisimoka locks up. \nCrazy Uga café across the road opens at about the same time as the market closes. Owner Willie knows what tourists and locals who have refined their culinary tastes in Auckland want. The café has a smart Italian coffee machine and a gently smiling Filipino woman behind the counter. The cliff-top café has wide views of the bay in which a dozen cross-Pacific sailing boats are anchored 100 metres from shore. Liz Light \nUga, Niue's famous coconut crab. \nA large humpback whale wends its way between the yachts. It stops, breaches, makes a big splash and terrifies a nearby sailor rowing his dinghy from ship to shore. Who needs to pay to go whale watching when it can be done for the price of a cup of coffee? \nNiue is unique in that it's a large, oval, coral limestone rock, 24 by 15 kilometres, perched on top of an ancient undersea volcano. There are no white sandy beaches, no gentle lagoons and none of the moody, cloud-capped mountains that usually make Pacific islands look pretty. The flat island is edged with limestone cliffs rising 25 metres or more from the sea. Waves endlessly crash against these cliffs although, in places, their bases are fringed with coral reefs which are exposed at low tide. This geology, the limestone, the cliffs, the endless action of waves and weathering from rain has created many caves, chasms, gorges and arches and exploring these keeps us busy on the other days. \nWe pack our rental car with lunch, reef shoes, togs , snorkels, walking shoes and torches and go exploring. Some of the caves, chasms and reefs are accessed by bush walks of a kilometre or two, others by climbing down cliffs on steep steps and a couple involve sturdy ladders, the sides of which are made of telegraph poles bolted to the cliff face. This is soft adventure tourism. There is, from time to time, an adrenalin buzz, but no overt danger. Jane Ussher \nThe July/August issue of NZ Life & Leisure is on sale now. \nAvaiki Cave, in the north of the island, wins our personal Niue outdoor attractions competition. The bush track leading to it is pretty but the gateway to the sea is spectacular. We walk a well-trodden path through a cave trimmed with stalagmites and stalactites, all tawny and pink, and this doorway opens from darkness to dazzling light and colour: the flat, shiny reef, thundering waves beyond and a swipe of blue sky decorated with cotton clouds. \nThe jewel, Avaiki, is 40 metres across the reef, carved from the cliff, vast and cathedral-like. It encloses a large turquoise pool in which iridescent blue fish swim. Stalactites have turned into columns over the millennia and stretch from bottom to top of the cave with others still growing, decorating the walls with fancy dun-coloured textures. The cave reaches back into the heart of Niue through dark, rocky passages, down which we do not venture. \nAnapala Chasm, on the east coast, is a great crack in a cliff into which we do venture. There are steep steps down into the dark and a rope thoughtfully placed on the edge to cling to. The darkness is not quite total with shafts of light entering from fissures far above. At the bottom of the chasm a pool is so clear that I can't define where the water begins. The bottom drops away quickly. I swim quietly, breaststroke, the water a dark mirror until I break it. It is scary, yes, but magic too. Emerald ferns and mosses cling to the chasm walls and high in the black cavern roof there are small but brilliant windows, fringed with foliage against the sky. \nWe stay at Nic's Bungalows in Tamakautoga on Niue's west side and in the late afternoon we stroll through the village. Children ride bikes in circles on the road, old ladies sit on their verandas in the soft sun and brilliantly feathered hens scratch and cluck in the gardens. We cross the village square and pass the church to linger at the lookout above the sea. We're hoping for a spectacular sunset but a totally clear sky usually means something less dramatic. The sun drops into the sea quite quickly and is followed by a green flash. I've looked for that moment for years – the legendary green flash – and Niue shows it to me. \nNOTEBOOK \nHow to get there: Air New Zealand flies to and from Niue twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. If you like exploring, walking, diving or snorkelling, stay a week. \nWhen to go: In the winter. The weather is lovely in Niue when it is filthy in New Zealand. The humpback whales are around Niue from July until October; seeing them and swimming with them is truly amazing. Time your trip to take in one of the village show days. Check in the events section of niueisland.com for dates. \nWhat to do: There are caves, chasms and reefs to explore. niueisland lists a few. Find out which is market day in Alofi and go early. Then have coffee at The Crazy Uga café across the road, while watching whales. \nWhere to stay: There is one resort-style hotel ( Scenic Matavai Resort Niue ), three lovely clifftop motels (Coral Gardens, Namukulu Cottages & Spa and Anaiki) and a number of less expensive guesthouses/motels. Accommodation often includes the option of a hire car – you will need it as Niue is spread out – plus the accommodation provider will meet you at the airport with the car. niueisland.com lists accommodation. \nEating out : R'lina's Restaurant & Bar, Talo's Restaurant & Grill and Kaiika Sushi & Gourmet Cuisine in Alofi all have great food. On Sunday eating out is challenging but Washaway Café, open only on Sundays, solves this problem. \nEating in: There is a supermarket in Alofi for the basics. Ask around for fresh fish. \nThis story first appeared in the July/August issue of NZ Life & Leisure.
