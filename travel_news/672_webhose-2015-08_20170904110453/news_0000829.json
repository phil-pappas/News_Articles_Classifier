Martin took his rightful place on the sideline at New York Jets training camp and — spoiler alert! — everyone survived.\nThe \"Game of Thrones\" creator, a big Jets and Giants fan, watched the two-hour-plus practice Wednesday at the Jets' facility with his wife Parris McBride and general manager Mike Maccagnan — playing the role of the kingsguard, of course — at his side.\nDecked out in a black Jets hat, black pants, T-shirt and suspenders decorated with skulls and crossbones, Martin chatted with players, fans and Jets officials who surely wanted to know the fates of characters Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Sansa Stark and Daenerys Targaryen, among others. He also sat down for a video interview with Jets left tackle, and \"Game of Thrones\" fan, D'Brickashaw Ferguson.\nNew York Jets tackle D'Brickashaw Ferguson (60) stretches with teammates during practice at NFL football training camp, Wednesday, Aug. 5, 2015, in Florham Park, N.J. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) Martin is the author of the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" epic fantasy novels that were adapted by HBO for its Emmy-winning dramatic series \"Game of Thrones.\" The books and series are known for major characters and fan favorites meeting their untimely, and often gruesome, demise.\n\"I am a big fan of Mr. Martin as a writer and I love the series, so it was a pleasure to spend the afternoon with him and his wife,\" Maccagnan said in a statement issued by the team. \"It was great to talk Jets history with them and hear how closely they have always followed the team.\"\nIt won't be the only local sports stop for Martin, who is planning attend the Staten Island Yankees minor league baseball game Saturday night. The game will take on a \"Game of Thrones\" theme, with the home Yankees playing as the Staten Island Direwolves and the visiting Hudson Valley Renegades dressing in the gold and red colors of the House of Lannister.\nMartin is currently in the process of writing the sixth book in the series, \"The Winds of Winter,\" which will be followed by \"A Dream of Spring.\" In his free time, Martin also keeps an online journal in which he blogs about whatever's on his mind, including the state of the Jets and Giants.\nBoth the show and novels are popular topics of conversation in workplaces around the world, including in NFL locker rooms. The Wall Street Journal wrote in a story published Wednesday that many players around football camps are debating about spoilers for the \"Game of Thrones\" series, which completed its fifth season in June.\nMartin had an easy solution on how to settle it all — and, no, not trial by combat.\n\"I think all the players,\" Martin said, \"should read the books.\"\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/05/b3/5d/c14b58061d664679b301bd7cc931ff8e-7dd78dbc193a4a909c4637613a9eba6c-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-05T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:35:35.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
