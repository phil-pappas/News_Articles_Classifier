One. You are told by Ucas Track at 8am that you have sucessfully landed a place at university, but the system frustratingly won't tell you your actual grades. Two. Clearing opens the day before Results Day on August 12 (6pm to be precise) but you aren't able to enter the details of the course you want to study into Track until 5pm the following day. Three. If you don't fancy going to either your firm or your insurance choice, you can't simply apply elsewhere, you have to request to be 'released', which can take up to 10 days. While it may seem confusing now, once you've got your head around it all , it's actually not that bad - and nor is calculating your Ucas points. The Ucas points tariff allocates a set number of points to different qualifications, allowing them to be compared easily by universities. According to Ucas, around a third of courses make reference to the tariff as part of the course requirements, and while some universities will offer places based on grades and subjects alone, others will want to know your score. It's important to be aware that not all qualifications attract a Ucas point score and, in the majority of cases, only the top level of achievement is counted. So, if you have done A-level French, your A/S grade will not also be taken into account. Use our A-level Ucas points calculator Furthermore, it's worth noting that music qualifications also attract Ucas points, but only if you achieve a grade six or above. The number of points awarded isn't insignificant. If you achieve a distinction at grade 8 in both theory and practical, your score could be worth more than a B at A-level - 105 points overall. For courses starting in 2017, the system is set to change slightly to reflect changes to A-levels and to better reflect the size of each qualification. But for those of you applying for courses starting this year or next, the points awarded will remain the same. But why do you need to work out your point score? Well, if you don't get your grades on Results Day, it's good to know how many points you achieved overall, so you can quickly check to see whether you meet the requirements of any places offered through Clearing or, equally, if you are trading up through Adjustment . Since the scope of qualifications that attract Ucas points is vast - think horse care, functional skills and sports studies - it is worth cross checking with the comprehensive list on the Ucas website to make sure you know exactly what your score is and if you could qualify for any additional points. To quickly review your A-level point score online, check out our Ucas points calculator here . The tool will then suggest courses that may suit your A-level subjects and grades. To calculate your Ucas point score, simple add up all your qualifications, taking the highest level you achieved in a subject. If you are working towards a double award in your A-levels, simply take the two grades you get and add them together.
