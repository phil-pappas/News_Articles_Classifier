This was the seventh such event to take place in the city. \nMakeup artists rallied to the site, helping dressed participants to turn themselves into characters out of their worst nightmares. \nZombie fever caught on in Russian youth culture, with walks staged in Birobidzhan, Rostov-on-Don and Nizhny Novgorod this summer - and more planned in Khabarovsk and Novosibirsk in the autumn. \nHowever, there is strong opposition to such events from a number of Christian activists, who describe zombie gatherings as harming the minds of minors and “popularizing death.” The Narodnij Sbor group has called for such walks to be banned. \nThe Orthodox group said it will film the event and then let experts decide whether the flashmob is a healthy thing for society. The group intends to call for an outright ban of such events. \nHowever, the Zombie Walk organizer, called Martin, said he is not worried. \nAs to those who may try to block the young zombie invasion, they will “try talking with them,” the organizers say. Given the rules of the game, which implies the “zombies” must moan in gibberish, those protesting against the event should really hope there are some “survivors” left. \nZombie Walks, which some treat as a form of carnival culture missing in the modern consumer world, have been gaining popularity around the world. They originated in North America and then quickly spread to countries in Europe, as well as to Latin American nations such as Argentina and Chile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T11:40:40.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
