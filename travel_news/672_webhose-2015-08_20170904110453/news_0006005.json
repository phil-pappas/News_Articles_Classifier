Starbucks is not disclosing the terms of the deal.\nStarbucks has 19 stores in Puerto Rico, the same number it had at the end of 2011. In that period Starbucks has added more than 5,000 stores around the world, and tripled the number of locations it operates in Brazil. In other Latin American markets, from Mexico to Argentina and Peru, the company also has seen significant growth.\nThe move underscores how Starbucks is increasingly relying on local partners in parts of Latin America and Europe to run its stores under license agreements, even as it keeps tight control of key markets like Japan, Brazil and China.\nMost Read Stories No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Chelan blazes: With no end in sight, thousands evacuate Reactions mixed to NYT story about Amazon’s work conditions Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes South Snohomish softball team loses Little League World Series tiebreaker game, 3-2 The strategy helped turn around what had been a lackluster Old World business; in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the number of licensed stores has jumped by 62 percent since late 2011.\nIn Latin America, a hard-to-crack region with deep coffee traditions of its own, licensing led to a 41 percent jump in the number of Starbucks outlets in Mexico over the same time period, and to nine new stores in Colombia in the year since Starbucks entered that market.\nA partnership with an El Salvadoran franchising company also led to the opening earlier this month of Starbucks’ first store in Panama, a booming trade hub where the Seattle coffee giant expects to launch 20 stores over the next five years.\nPuerto Rico’s Empresas Fonalledas, whose origins date back to the late 19th century, runs large real estate, manufacturing and food businesses, including the company that currently provides milk for Starbucks lattes on the island.\nAlisha Damodaran, a spokeswoman for Starbucks, said the company plans to double its number of stores in Puerto Rico over the next couple of years.\n“This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Starbucks in Puerto Rico,” said Rich Nelsen, Starbucks general manager for Latin America, in a statement.\nBut the challenges are steep, given Puerto Rico’s struggling economy. A long period of stagnation in the Caribbean island has led to crushing government debt, widespread emigration of young professionals to the U.S. mainland, and soaring crime levels.\nEarlier this month the U.S. territory missed a payment on its bonds, according to The Associated Press.\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .
