The newest tour takes travelers to Potala Palace, Jokhang Temple, and then allows time for exploring Barkhor Bazaar.\nThe tour kicks off early in the morning. Typically, travel groups begin with Potala Palace however this may vary based on when tour time slots are available; TCTS must register visitors in advance. The group’s native Tibetan guide will walk them through the magnificent palace while sharing its history and significance. All in all, this is a great place to learn about Tibet’s culture and history. After a break for lunch it’s a short walk over to Jokhang Temple. Located in the heart of Barkhor Bazaar, it’s surrounded by lots of activity. Pilgrims flock here from remote corners of Tibet to pray and visit the only known image of the Buddha, created during his lifetime, known to remain in existence today.\nAfter Jokhang Temple travelers are free to wander the Barkhor area, a great place to shop for Tibetan arts and crafts while watching every day Tibetan life in action.\nOne-day tours by TCTS make Tibet travel an easy, memorable, experience that allows travelers to walk away with valuable knowledge of one of the world’s most fascinating and mysterious places.
