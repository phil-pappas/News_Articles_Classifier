Statues surface in Paris \nTwo giant Egyptian statues and a temple slab submerged in the Mediterranean Sea for more than a millennium have gone on display at Paris’ Arab World Institute. \nThe museum erected the granite monuments as a preview of its exhibition “Osiris: Mysteries of Submerged Egypt,” which will open Sept. 8. The show will feature almost 300 artifacts, most of them discovered through underwater excavations by French marine archaeologist Frank Goddio. \nGoddio and his team discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient cities of Canopus in 1997 and Thonis-Heracleion in 2000. The cities sank into the Mediterranean during the eighth century after a series of natural disasters. \nGoddio oversaw the raising of statues of the Egyptian gods Osiris and Isis, and the slab, known as a stele, that sat at the front of a temple. Each is about 20 feet tall. Erie Canal lock promoted \nNew York state is planning a living-history rest area near an Erie Canal lock along a stretch of I-90 near Albany. \nThe facility, which will open in the fall, will include a visitors center adjacent to Lock E-13 on the Mohawk River in the Montgomery County town of Root. \nThe rest area will offer tourism information and interpretive displays showcasing the region’s history. Clothes make the exhibit \nMore than 200 years’ worth of fashion choices, from frock coats to mini-dresses, are on display at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia. \nThe exhibition, “Threads: The Story in Our Clothes,” tells the diverse histories of South Carolinians through their clothing. It examines why people wore what they did and what role society, fashion, the environment and practicality played in that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T21:28:16.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
