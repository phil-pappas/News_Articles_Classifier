Bylakuppe, situated 90 kilometers from Mysore on SH 88, comprises of two Tibetan refugee settlements that were setup in 1961 and 1969 respectively and which have now grown into a full-fledged town housing the largest Tibetan population outside of Dharamsala in India. In 1960, the Government of Mysore allotted about 3,000 acres of land at Bylakuppe in Mysore district in Karnataka and the first ever Tibetan exile settlement came into existence in 1961. A few years later another settlement, Tibetan Dickey Larsoe was established. More than 150,000 Tibetan refugees have found asylum in India during the past 50 years, subsequent to Jawaharlal Nehru’s offer to shelter Tibetan refugees until their eventual return. But they have not returned; perhaps never will. It was a smart gamble on the part of India that unfortunately failed. Had it succeeded, India’s game with China might have had a different ending. You can approach it from Mysore or from Mangalore. In either case, the best option is to take a KSRTC bus – Mysore-Mangalore or vice-versa, as the case may be – and get down at Kushalnagar Bus Stand. From there take an auto rickshaw to the Tibetan Town – about 20 minutes ride. Alternatively you can tell the bus-conductor to let you down at Kuppam stop/Kuppam village square, which is little closer to the Tibetan Town. The gradual change in scenery and the feeling of being transported to another country with every step one takes towards where the monasteries are located, adds to the mystique and charm of Bylakuppe. The Golden Temple here is fast becoming a major attraction local tourists; the environs are crowded and dirty, as in any popular tourist destination The best place to stay, probably, within the Tibetan town is the Sera Jey Yiga Choeling Centre Guest House. The place is spacious and the rooms are pampering. It is definitely a steal for the price they charge. Just give them a ring in advance and book a room. Rooms are plenty, and you should not have any difficulty in getting one; unless there is some programme going on at the Centre. So, it is always good to book in advance. The monks are very courteous. There is an eating place on the ground floor, which serves noodles rice, really hot thukpa and momos. The food is not very tasty – it is bland sort of; but well, that is what it is supposed to be. If you want it really spicy, ask for the red chilly chutney; that will set your tongue on fire. For breakfast, they serve some sort of finger biscuits – baked or deep fried, I am not sure; but not bad; do try them. The different camps are far apart – there are at least four or five of them, or may be more. You need to take an auto rickshaw to travel between them, unless you have a good stamina. But do visit all of them. Each camp, or at least the main ones, have their own markets. The markets are worth seeing, for the Tibetan ware, the local produce and food. Here you get excellent momos and thukpas – authentic and hot. The other thing that you should really look for are the locally made noodles – of all types. The prices are very reasonable and choice is wide. Something worth carrying home. Only problem is they are delicate, and crush easily; you will have to pack them properly. The land in Bylakuppe grows mainly maize. But the Tibetans themselves do not work in the fields. They lease the land to the local Kannadigas for a rent that is small compared to the value of the crop, or employ the locals as daily wage workers. It is a win-win situation for the Tibetans as well as the locals. The monasteries are showcases of affluence; so are the seminaries and halls of residence. The monks do not drink or smoke. But other than that they have all the comforts of life. The fridges in the guest house were full of Coke and Red Bull cans; and the food that went waste was really hurting. Golden Temple is nothing but gold. Share this Post:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T06:39:32.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
