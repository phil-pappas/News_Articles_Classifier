It is about 60 km from Aurangabad. You can drive till here and then begin your excursion trekking up the hilly slopes. Camping options are non-existent but hiking is easy enough and good as the fresh breeze in the green surroundings refresh your energy levels. We suggest you take a short history lesson before you go hiking to know the significance of this historic fort. As you hike up, you will see ancient stone fortifications, battlements, water tanks. The fort was built about the middle of the 15th century by a Maratha Chief and was named after him. It remained in the possession of his descendants for about a century and was then taken by the Muslim rulers. Between 16th and 17th centuries it belonged to the Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar, as is evidenced front several inscriptions in the fort in which some of the kings of this dynasty are mentioned. Carry along: Small picnic goodies with ample drinking water is a must to pack along here. From Delhi: Mathura, Uttar Pradesh Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi Temple is the most sought after devout centers in Mathura. Its predominance over the other holy spots are due to the belief that the temple stands on the same place where Lord Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudev. Well-connected: Mathura District situated along the banks of the river Yamuna is a district of Uttar Pradesh. Good road and rail connections from Delhi can easily lead you to Mathura. We suggest you plan an outing with your family to witness the Janmashtami celebrations (Birth of Lord Krishna on September 5, 2015). The town starts getting decked up a week before the ceremony. Locals stage many street plays, costume displays in schools and temple sessions are organised to mark the holy birth. What's in a name: According to the Archeological Survey of India plaque at the Mathura Museum, the city is mentioned in Ramayana. In the epic, the Ikshwaku Prince Shatrughna slays a demon called Lavanasura and claims the land. Afterwards, the place came to be known as Madhuvan as it was thickly wooded, then Madhupura and later Mathura. From Bangalore: Harangi Reservoir, Madikeri, Karnataka Many Bangaloreans like to book a resort stay near the backwaters. And a day trip to see Harangi Reservoir is often on the cards, says ET-Travel reader Nicole Figueredo. During monsoons, the Harangi reservoir is a beautiful place to visit as the force of water gushing down is high and strong. This reservoir is built across the tributary of River Kaveri near Kushalnagar. This dam with a height of 47 mts. and 846 mts in length is a popular picnic spot for school kids and enthusiasts who like to watch the water flow down like poetry. Harangi Dam is the first dam build across the River Kaveri. We suggest you bring your own food packs along for a nice picnic and then undertake short walks along designated paths. Harangi Dam is about 36 km from Madikeri. A drive here over the weekends is serene and comfortable. In Kushalnagar, you can settle in for some fresh tiffins and indulge in steamed idlis, sambar with delicious chutneys of the vegetables that are seasonal. Shop for some cute wooden toys on the way at roadside stalls.
