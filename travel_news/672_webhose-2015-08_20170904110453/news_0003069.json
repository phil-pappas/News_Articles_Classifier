The fee is $60 for the visa, which last 30 days once in India. \nAuthorities have also added a further seven airports to the list of nine where arriving tourists can have their visas processed with both Jaipur and Varanasi now on the list. \nThe move has been welcomed by the industry, which has been so concerned about recent proposals which could have seen Brits forced to attend 14 different regional centres for biometric testing that delegates met with an Indian delegation in March to discuss them. \nIf Only business development manager Neil Sealy said: “This is great news. I expect that this will be a real boost for tourism to India because obviously it simplifies the visa process and makes it a lot fairer for prospective travellers. It also means people can book last minute too. \n“I suspect they did listen at that meeting where a number of tour operators voiced their concerns and hopefully the message was made clear that India was losing market share to neighbouring countries.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T07:23:07.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
