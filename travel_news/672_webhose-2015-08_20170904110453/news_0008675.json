Tim Sheldon, D-Potlatch, in a letter to Acting State Auditor Jan Jutte Quote: : “As reported by The Times , Commissioner Goldmark agreed to an artificially low price on a lease of state aquatic bedlands in the Hood Canal.”\nState Sen. Mark Miloscia, R-Federal Way, also signed the letter.\nIn June, The Seattle Times reported that Goldmark’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) accepted a $720,000 offer in 2014 from the Navy for 50-year control of 4,804 acres of Hood Canal seafloor.\nMost Read Stories Man shot dead in South Seattle while on phone with mom Seattle company copes with backlash on $70,000 minimum wage Impressions from Day 2 of Seahawks' training camp Seahawks sign four-year extension with linebacker Bobby Wagner worth a reported $43 million Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's But an earlier, independent, state-approved appraisal valued the lease at $1.68 million.\nThe $720,000 value allowed the Navy to avoid congressional scrutiny of the deal. Goldmark agreed to that price despite state law requiring DNR obtain fair-market value for the seafloor.\n“That’s corruption,” said Miloscia, chair of the senate’s Accountability and Reform Committee. Formerly an Air Force contract officer who dealt with appraisals, he said reducing the earlier appraisal to “avoid federal statute … is, in my mind, unconscionable.”\nOn Friday, Sandra Kaiser, a DNR spokeswoman, said the state’s appraisal practices were upheld by a Jefferson County Superior Court judge.\nIf the auditor doesn’t investigate, Miloscia said, his committee will.\nThorndyke Resource, developer of a pier project on the Hood Canal’s western shoreline, sued the state and Navy to overturn the lease, which created a restriction along Hood Canal seafloor that stopped the pier project.\nTimes reporting showed the Navy has quietly targeted projects, rating them according to perceived threat level. Meanwhile, area developers say they were unaware their work was being monitored.\nThe Navy cited multiple development proposals as “encroachment threats,” including the pier project, within its “sphere of influence.” The military suggested commercial boating, seaplanes and tourism could hamper the military’s operations in the interest of “national defense.”\n“I’m worried that the historic uses of our shoreline and waterways will be harmed by these unilateral actions by the commissioner’s office,” Sheldon said. “The commissioner’s job is to adhere to all the duties of the constitution.\n“I think that includes getting a fair price for something.”\nIn June, the Navy and DNR told The Times they could not comment on the appraisal because of pending litigation.\nThe Jefferson County judge wrote that the appraisal was not “arbitrary, capricious or unlawful” when she dismissed a case against the state in May.\nThorndyke has appealed that decision to the Washington State Court of Appeals.\n“It’s a factual issue and could not be resolved on summary judgment” the way the judge did, said Svend Brandt-Erichsen, Thorndyke’s attorney. “It’s been frustrating to not get to the merits, to actually have the actions taken by the Navy and the DNR reviewed.”\nWill Drabold: wdrabold@seattletimes.com or 206-464-2288.
