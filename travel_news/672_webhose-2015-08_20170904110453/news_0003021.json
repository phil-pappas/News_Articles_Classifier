Click! Check into the hotel through your mobile device? Click! Enter your room or order room service with your mobile device? These actions are now a click or tap away, as the hospitality sector moves to embrace technological advances and look into ways to engage their customers before, during and after their stay.\nIn a report on the fast-rising adoption of technology among travellers and companies in the hospitality sector, trends in mobility and social media in particular are creating opportunities for the sector. Embracing technology has also enabled companies such as hoteliers to level up guest engagement and operational efficiencies.\nMr. Harbans Singh, founder of UbiQ and returning exhibitor at the HospitalityTechnology exhibition at FHA2016 (Food&HotelAsia2016) gave his take on technological trends in Asia and their impact on hospitality players in Asia.\nQuick and nimble wins the race\nTwo technological trends that are catching on in Asia are mobility and cloud computing. Asia has the largest number of mobile users in the world, hence, the move to mobility is more rapid here than in other parts of the world. Consumers are being trained daily by different business to be able to use their mobile devices to transact online and hence, the role of the device is evolving from one which just makes calls to one today, which allows you to run your entire business as well. This trend is growing even more rapidly and all businesses are racing to catch up with this phenomenon. Hotels need to address the need for mobility and the ability for their guests to operate their mobile devices, which include laptops, tablets, mobile phones within the hotel premises. Good Wi-Fi is of importance in most guest buying decisions today as a result of this.\nToday many software applications are being deployed in the cloud. This essentially means that the software is no longer installed on computers within the premise but instead, is located in a remote third party data centre and accessed via the web. This enables users to access from anywhere and also enhances collaboration within the organisation. Hotels would subscribe to this service at a lower monthly cost and this helps hotels to reduce their capex investments for infrastructure and hardware. At the same time, when the demands for capacity and bandwidth increase within the hotel, cloud systems are able to scale easily at minimal additional costs. Hence, hotels need to be aware that this trend is significant and future technology buying decisions should weigh applications that can be hosted on the cloud.\nSource:- Food&HotelAsia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:58:30.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
