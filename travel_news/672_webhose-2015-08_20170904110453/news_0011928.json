Believe it or not, the incredibly pricey holiday travel season is just around the corner. Start planning now because it could save you money, thanks to ticket prices that can leap 30% to 50% at Thanksgiving. The closer you get to the November holiday, the bigger the jump.\nWhy you should be thinking about holidays now: During any peak travel season (Thanksgiving, Christmas, summer) it's not a matter of finding good deals but finding the best-of-the-bad deals. This can take some strategizing but a good way to save is to find routes less affected by seasonal price hikes than others — which is why I say, \"fly big, fly short.\" Another way of putting it: Fly competitive hub-to-hub routes where the flights last roughly 90 minutes or less.\nExamples:\nChicago - Detroit\nFlights in October: $213 Flights at Thanksgiving: $224 Dallas - Houston\nFlights in October: $173 Flights at Thanksgiving: $180 Los Angeles - San Francisco\nFlights in October: $220 Flights at Thanksgiving: $226 On the opposite side of the spectrum is a route like Kansas City - Albany, where October fares are currently running about $360 but Thanksgiving prices are a hefty $460.\nHow to make 'fly big, fly short' work for you\nThe key is to be flexible when it comes to destinations and airports. If you live in a smaller city, consider making the longer drive to a bigger airport and do the same for your destination. For example, Sacramento residents might want to price out the economics of making the longer drive to San Francisco or Oakland.\nAnother idea is to fly to/from an airline focus city which may not be as big as a hub but can offer big value from at least one airline. JetBlue's focus city of Long Beach, Calif., is a good example. Other cities becoming cheaper with at least some airlines include Austin and Baltimore. As you search for flights, always compare prices from multiple airports.\nWhat to avoid during peak travel periods\nWaiting until the last minute to purchase tickets usually means paying top dollar. For Thanksgiving travel, purchase tickets at least 30 days in advance — but 45 days ahead is even better.\nFareCompare CEO Rick Seaney is an airline industry insider and top media air travel resource.
