Crossing the finish at 44.30 seconds, Gardiner set yet another record while dethroning Merritt in the process. \nWith these kinds of performances, Gardiner’s coach, George Cleare has a lot of expectations for him. At only 19 years old, Gardiner continues to break old and set new records. According to Cleare, Gardiner is a “work in progress”. He went on to say that they were only “scratching the surface” as far as the potential that Gardiner possesses. He has been competing in the sport since his early teenage years and ran in the 400 meter at the national championships in 2013. \nMuch of his success can be attributed to the foundation set for him at home on Moore’s Island, Abaco. Moore's Island is a little cay off mainland Abaco, with a population of about 1000. It is approximately seven miles long and 3.5 miles wide. It has two settlements, Hard Bargain, which is the capital and the other settlement is the Bight. Moore’s Island is one of the best-kept secrets for adventurous, bone fishing enthusiasts. With for calm waters, warm breezes and panoramic beauty, it is the perfect location for boating and sailing. The climate in Abaco and the miles of untouched beaches, made it an ideal location for Gardiner to train outdoors, although the training grounds were far from the state-of-the-art facilities where he currently competes. \n“The future of The Bahamas is being well represented by young athletes like Mr. Gardiner. We congratulate him and are excited to observe his career development and successes. These determined athletes are true ambassadors and represent The Islands Of The Bahamas globally. His success has now put his hometown, Moore’s Island in the spotlight,” said the Hon. Obie H. Wilchcombe, Minister of Tourism for The Bahamas. \n“We are so proud of Steven and we thank everyone for their support. Steven is my hero,” said Theresa Gardiner, mother of Steven. \nWith expectations high, all eyes are set on the Olympics. The next hurdle and target in Steven’s sights is the reigning champion, Kirani James from Grenada. The competition is high with many quality quarter mile runners so necessary adjustments must be made. However, many are confident in Gardiner’s abilities, including his coach, and believe he will be making headlines once again in the 2016 Olympics. \nBy the looks of it, the focused Gardiner will be putting everything he has into preparation for the Olympic games. As his career races off, the hopes, prayers and support of the Bahamian people and Moore’s Island will be with him through every stride. \nAbout The Islands Of The Bahamas \nThe Islands Of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others.
