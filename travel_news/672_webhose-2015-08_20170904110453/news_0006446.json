It's part of a dramatic new initiative to attract visitors to the Rioja Alavesa, part of Northern Spain, in the Basque region near Bilbao.\nA heavenly spot to soak in the scenery: Hotel Viura is a mixture of upmarket lodging and classic Spain\nThis is a place where, these days, wine is not only grown by lone farmers, but sampled by ever-growing numbers of visitors.\nAs well as the vines, a crop of bold, exciting new buildings has also sprouted up through the sun-dried earth.\nNone more dramatic than the Hotel Viura, which looks from the outside as if a number of square and rectangular structures have been precariously balanced, Lego-style, on top of each other.\nThe hotel reception desk is more cave than communal area, set against a natural, bulging rockface.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tripping the Tuscan light fantastic: Learning to paint in...

Share this article Share And room numbers are marked up in chalk on a blackboard-type wall, with ceiling rafters made from interlocking pieces of wine barrel.\nThere's an exhibition of black-and-white photographs of film stars from Ava Gardner to Marlene Dietrich, all in gorgeous Balenciaga gowns.\nAnd on the walls of the dining room — six-course meal with wines for £56 — there are blown-up paintings of rock stars from Bono to Bruce Springsteen.\nBut nothing beats a gentle drive around the area.\nIn every direction, ranks of vines stretch out like a mass of orderly, green dreadlocks. Every so often a pretty little hill town rises from the vines.\nOne such is the village of Rivas de Tereso, where, at the peaceful Asador Jose Mari restaurant, locals dine on sumptuous artichokes under the shade of trees.\nDaring: The hotel is built of what seem to be mini-structures, one balanced precariously on the other\nAlternatively, you can park outside the ancient, car-free hill town of Laguardia.\nFour times every summer they run bulls up and down the old-fashioned main street, urged on by an energetic brass band and crowds of young men who shin up the drainpipes to avoid the oncoming horns.\nAnd if it gets too hot, you can always go underground and visit one of the many bodegas, or wine-producing firms, in the area.\nThere are 42 growers within cork-popping distance of the Hotel Viura, and the nearest is the headquarters of the Valserrano de la Marquesa winemakers, where the fifth generation of the de Simon family harvest 400,000 kilos of grapes per year.\nAlternatively, you can take a short car ride to the headquarters of 87-year-old Luis Cañas and sample his wines in the comfort of an elegant, cool tasting room sunk into the side of his property.\nMost dramatic of all is a trip to the Lopez de Heredia winery, in the small town of Haro.\nYou arrive in a beautifully-lit modern building containing a high-sided wooden bar area that serves as a reminder of what a bodega used to be.\nStep down the stairs, into the deep-dug, subterranean cellars, and you enter a world of darkness and mystery.\nTake a seat: The hotel is a fine base for a few days exploring what remains a less-known corner of Spain\nFor hundreds of yards, you walk past towering walls of stacked-up barrels, containing wine whose production date is barely visible in the torchlight.\nThey even have a tasting room that is straight out of Count Dracula. At any moment you expect a ghoul to emerge and offer you a goblet of something dark and red.\nFor those who prefer sunlight to twilight, there is still plenty to do. Most exhilarating activity is to hire a state-of the-art quad bike for €160 (£115), and go roaring off around the roads and farm tracks.\nYou can spot other space-age buildings such as the shiny silver Ysios bodega, whose undulating silver roof reflects the contours of the mountains just behind.\nYes, it's all action now in this hitherto neglected part of Spain.\nJust as Rioja wines have begun appearing in all forms and in both red and white, so the whole area has started opening its arms to visitors, and British Airways has started flying to the very manageably-sized Bilbao Airport (barely a dozen departure gates).\nOnce upon a time, when arriving here, you simply put your foot down and kept driving until you got somewhere else.\nThese days, there are as many reasons to pull over as there are wines and wineries.\nAnd at the last count, that was over 400.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own break to Rioja Alavesa British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com ) flies to Bilbao from £72 return.\nDouble rooms at the Hotel Viura (0034 945 609000, www.hotelviura.com ) cost from £103 per night, and the Gourmet Experiences start at £341 for two people, with two nights B&B, wine tasting lunch or dinner and local winery tour.", "external_links": ["http://www.ba.com/", "http://www.hotelviura.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1LeQ0dc"], "published": "2015-08-17T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:43:50.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
