What I want to highlight to you today is our culture, the unique selling point we have that differentiates us to other tourism destinations. The Creole People of Seychelles, the Seychellois is and remains the perfect melting pot of cultures with historical lines coming from France, Africa, Great Britain, India and China. This has given us a unique culture and it has been placed at the centre of our tourism marketing. When we say culture we are in fact putting our people at the centre of our development because we cannot have our culture without having our people placed at the centre of our country’s life”the Tourism Minister said before highlighting that Seychelles is today the new holiday destination for India and for Indian Honeymooners and Wedding saying that if Seychelles was good for Prince William and Kate Middleton of Great Britain it must also be the destination for the lovely Indian brides.\nAfter touring the long list of unique selling points of Seychelles Minister St.Ange spoke about the recent Bollywood action thriller “Rocky Handsome” with the popular John Abraham and said that Seychelles was expected to attract more Indian Films shortly.\nThe address was followed by a Q & A session where Minister Alain St.Ange, Minister Joel Morgan, H.C.
