Also known as SAS, the carrier is a member of the Star Alliance and currently serves five U.S. destinations. Notably, Miami will be SAS’s only destination in the southeastern U.S. when the new flights begin next year.\n“Congratulations to the Miami-Dade Aviation Department team for once again expanding MIA’s impressive air service network and for connecting our community to two of Northern Europe’s premier capital cities,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez.\nThe pair of new international routes will provide travelers from Scandinavia with direct access to all that Greater Miami and the Beaches have to offer, as well as an unrivalled lineup of direct connections to more than 75 destinations throughout Latin America, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Scandinavia-bound travelers will enjoy nonstop service to two of Europe’s leading capitals and their surroundings. Both Copenhagen and Oslo combine rich history – each city dates back at least 900 years – with the features of modern, cosmopolitan living: arts, culture, leading European universities and thriving economies led by the finance, banking and maritime industries. Copenhagen and Oslo also rank among the world’s top cities in terms of quality of life, blessed with expansive waterfronts and ample green spaces.\n“MIA’s strategic push to become a truly global gateway is taking a big step forward with the announcement of new nonstop service to Copenhagen and Oslo aboard Scandinavian Airlines,” said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González. “We welcome SAS to Miami with open arms and together we look forward to offering our valued customers easy access to three phenomenal destinations.”\n“We know that our frequent flyers want flexible travel with a good timetable and daily departures. These new direct routes together with the renewal of our long haul fleet and our broad network mean we have far and away the strongest offer between Scandinavia and the USA,” said Rickard Gustafson, President and CEO of SAS. “We are looking forward to offering our customers new travel opportunities and giving them a warm welcome onboard our aircraft.”\nSAS will offer a total of seven weekly departures from MIA when service begins. Outbound Miami-Copenhagen flights are scheduled to depart Miami at 3:50 p.m. on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, while Miami-Oslo flights are scheduled to depart MIA on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 3:50 p.m.\nSource:- Miami International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:23:15.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
