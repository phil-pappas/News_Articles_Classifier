And while Croatia, to the north west, has grown in popularity, few Britons drive two hours down the coast from Dubrovnik to the ancient town of Budva. Founded by the Greeks in the fourth century BC, and then fortified during the Middle Ages, the town forms the heart of the “Budva Riviera”, which runs 22 miles from Trsteno to Buljarica, and is dotted with a series of sheltered coves and eight miles of sand and pebble beaches. You can start your day by stepping through an arched doorway in Budva’s medieval walls straight on to the town beach. Lined by tables and lounge-sofas, and managed by nearby cafés, this is where glamorous locals come to have coffee and gossip. It isn’t the ideal spot for swimming, but there are several other beaches within walking distance. A five-minute stroll east along a narrow coastal path lie the pebble beaches of Mogren I and II. On the way, note the bronze sculpture of a ballet dancer, a symbol of Budva, performing a graceful arabesque as she gazes out to sea. Mogren I is backed by cliffs, and connected to Mogren II by a short tunnel. Skip Slovenska Plaza, a one-mile strip of greyish sand west of town, which is overlooked by restaurants and late-night bars, and is crowded with sunloungers. For more secluded bathing, head to the small island of Sveti Nikola (known to locals as Hawaii) by taxi-boat from Budva’s seafront promenade. Covered by pinewoods and fragrant Mediterranean vegetation, it has a few beaches and a restaurant. Best of all, you can rent a kayak and paddle around to the south side to reach several isolated coves. • Miloš Karadaglić's Kotor: My Kind of Town • Montenegro: land of fairy tales For many, the highlight of this strip of coastline is Sveti Stefan, a small island six miles east of Budva connected to the mainland by a sand spit. The island is home to the Aman Sveti Stefan hotel (see below), which has exclusive use of some of the island’s spectacular beaches – though there are public beaches, too. Also east of Budva, the one-mile long beach at Becici is managed by the several large hotels that overlook it, with waiter service, beds and a parasol. Visitors can pay to enter. West of Budva, the Blue Flag Jaz is a curving arc of fine pebbles and sand, ideal for children, with pedal boats, kayaks and jet-skis for hire. It is backed by a campsite, and hosts open-air summer concerts and the annual Sea Dance Festival. Finally, return to Budva’s town beach for a sundowner, and marvel over this gem of the Adriatic. Getting there Budva is 12 miles from Tivat airport, 40 miles from Podgorica airport and 60 miles from Dubrovnik airport, in Croatia. Montenegro Airlines ( montenegroairlines.com ) flies from Gatwick to Tivat twice weekly (Wed and Sun) in April-June and September-October, and three times a week (Mon, Wed and Sun) in July-August. Ryanair ( ryanair.com ) flies from Stansted to Podgorica twice weekly (Wed and Sun). Alternatively, you can fly to Dubrovnik and drive down the coast to Budva. • Balkans train journeys: travels with Tito Where to stay Aman Sveti Stefan : This superb property combines a tiny island – once a fishing village within 15th-century walls – and a Thirties villa built for the Serbian royal family. Renovated and reopened by Aman in 2008, it has 58 rooms, suites and cottages, plus a slick spa (00382 33 420 000; amanresorts.com ; doubles from £575; Villa Milocer is open all year, the island is open from May-September). • Top ten places to spot celebrities on holiday Hotel Astoria: In Budva’s old town, the Astoria has six double rooms and six suites, each with bathroom and spa bath. The ground-floor café has tables right on the beach (00 382 33 451 110; astoriamontenegro.com ; doubles from £90; open all year). Hotel Poseidon: On Jaz beach, this three-star, family-run hotel has rooms with sea views and balconies, and two-room apartments (sleeping four) with kitchenettes, ideal for families. The restaurant has a beachside terrace with free Wi-Fi (00382 33 463 134 poseidon-jaz.com ; doubles from £34; open May-October). Where to eat Tri Ribara: Owned by a family of fishermen, Tri Ribara (Three Fishermen) is known throughout Montenegro. Right by the beach, the decor is deceptively rustic; the fresh seafood is exquisite. It lies just outside Rafailovici, a 1½-mile walk from Becici (00382 33 471 050). Jadran: On the seafront promenade in Budva, with a front terrace opening on to the marina, Jadran looks touristy but is loved by locals. The menu includes seafood, barbecued meats, pasta and pizza (00382 69 030 180; restaurantjadran.com ). Langust: In the fishing village of Przno, close to Sveti Stefan, this informal eatery has heavy wooden tables and benches on a vine-covered terrace overlooking the beach. It is open all year and is highly regarded by locals for its fresh seafood (00382 33 468 369). • Makarska, Croatia: Secret Seaside The inside track Sveti Stefan first opened as a state-run hotel in the Sixties, when Montenegro was part of Tito’s Yugoslavia. The guest book from that period includes names such as Kirk Douglas, Sophia Loren and Doris Day. Today, Aman promises discretion, though the Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic makes no secret of the fact that he got married here in summer 2014. Did you know? Budva’s old town was hit by an earthquake in 1979 – of 400 buildings, only eight escaped damage – so what you see today is largely the work of restoration experts.
