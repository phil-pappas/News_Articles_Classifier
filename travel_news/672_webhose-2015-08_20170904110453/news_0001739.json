When I first started eating healthily I was lost because I had no idea how to sate my cravings. I didn’t realise that I could deal with them using natural ingredients rather than refined sugars and flours. Once I discovered this I really fell in love with healthy cooking. These three recipes – peanut butter and honey flapjacks, a carrot and raisin loaf and homemade berry jam – are great examples of healthy twists on classic dishes. They all taste amazing. They’re perfect if you’re looking for a natural, nourishing, sweet snack. I love making the three together and serving them as a summery afternoon tea to impress friends and family. Sinless wonders: Ella’s peanut butter flapjacks (top) berry jam (right) and carrot and raisin loaf (bottom) (CLARE WINFIELD) The peanut butter and honey flapjacks are one of my favourite recipes ever. I’ve made them so many times in the past few weeks and still can’t get enough of them. I have to warn you that they’re pretty addictive though so you may get through them quicker then you’d expect! The mix of banana and peanut butter makes each bite soft and gooey, while the raisins, coconut oil, vanilla and honey give it a deliciously sweet taste. They’re not overly sweet though as there are only three spoonfuls of honey across the whole batch. They work really well as an on-the-go breakfast, as well as an afternoon snack. The other amazing thing about these flapjacks is that they’re so quick and easy to make and they don’t require anything more than a mixing bowl, spoon and oven. If peanuts aren’t your favourite, or you have an allergy, replace the peanut butter with another nut butter. Ella and her jam (CLARE WINFIELD) The carrot and raisin loaf is easy to make too, and has a wonderfully simple ingredient list. Each loaf is made up of oats, carrots, apples, bananas, raisins, cinnamon, vanilla, coconut oil and maple syrup – so it’s full of goodness. The texture of the loaf is great: each slice is soft and almost chewy, thanks to the carrots, apples and bananas, but it just melts in your mouth. The cinnamon and vanilla then give it a rich sense of spice, while the baked raisins burst when you bite into them. The loaf tastes delicious on its own, but it’s especially good topped with a thick layer of my homemade berry jam and a little nut butter. It’s my favourite afternoon snack, although it also makes a good breakfast – if you have any leftovers… • Deliciously Ella: how to go gluten-free naturally I know it may seem strange to make jam using chia seeds and without all the usual quantities of sugar, but I promise it works. Unlike conventional jam it does only keep for a week but for that week it tastes fantastic and the chia seeds thicken it up so the texture is almost jam-like. I use a little honey to sweeten it, but I like to keep it quite tart. If you’re after something sweeter or want to share it with friends and family then just add more sweetener. I use this jam on my carrot and raisin loaf, but it’s also amazing spread on rye bread, drizzled on top of creamy porridge or added to a bowl of coconut yogurt and homemade granola.
