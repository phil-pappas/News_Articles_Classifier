Comment MetroWest Daily News, Framingham, MA By THE WASHINGTON POST Posted Aug. 5, 2015 at 5:31 PM By THE WASHINGTON POST Posted Aug. 5, 2015 at 5:31 PM » Social News Q: I am considering visiting the Savanna area and am interested in Tybee Island. I was thinking about renting a place on Tybee versus staying in Savannah. I would appreciate any input you could provide on that plan and things I shouldn't miss in either location; I hear the traffic to the island is horrible but is that every day? Thank you A: I've done both, but unfortunately there's no easy answer to this one. If you like the beach, you'll definitely want to consider Tybee. But it's also true that traffic can be a challenge, especially on weekends. I'd consider splitting your time between both if you want the best of both worlds. I wouldn't want to have to choose between the two. Savannah actually has some great vacation rentals. When we rented in Tybee, we never left the island. - Christopher Elliott Q: Our family has decided to take an Alaskan cruise next year. The group will be 20-25 adults. My questions are: 1) can we leverage the number of people/cabins for a better rate and 2) I know we can't avoid crowds but when is a good time to go? A: Most ocean cruises require a minimum of eight cabins for a group discount. But always check the group rate against any promo rates that are being offered. Sales are sometimes cheaper. As for best time to go, high season is summer, with July typically drawing the largest crowds. If you don't mind colder weather and shorter days, September is less popular. - Carol Sottili Q: What are your thoughts on must-see venues, must-do activities, must-eat at restaurants for the drive from Miami, through the Keys, and including two-three days in Key West? Is Everglades National Park worth a visit? John Pennekamp Park? Stops in Islamorada or any of the other Keys? Two adults, two tweens are traveling. Thanks! A: There's a lot to see in the Keys. Pennekamp is terrific if you snorkel or scuba, but skip it if you don't plan to do either. Islamorada probably has the best fishing in the Keys. I would recommend flats fishing on the Gulf side. If you have time in Marathon, check out Pigeon Key. Key West has some great museums, but if you want to experience something really authentic, catch a boat to the Dry Tortugas. - C.E. Q: We are planning to spend 10 days in Brazil next month and will divide our time between Rio and Salvador. Is it worth it to plan a side trip to the Iguazu Falls? A: The falls are one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, and they appear on most people's before-I-kick-the-bucket lists. Your decision depends on whether you are a \"waterfall\" person or not. (I am, for the most part, not.) You will definitely need to plan, and the trip can grow costly with hotel, transportation, admission fees and boat ride (recommended). But again, it's one of the Big Seven ... - Andrea Sachs Page 2 of 3 - Q: I apologize if this is a novice question, but what is the best way to book a last minute domestic flight? I usually use kayak.com or southwest.com, but with Southwest's current pricing, I'd have to pay at least $600 for a one-hour flight. Would my travel agent have better access to unsold seats on traditional airlines? A: I've not found a site that offers last-minute airfares at a deep discount. Figure out which airlines operate between your two airports, as there may be other discount carriers, such as Spirit or Frontier, that offer service. And if it's only an hour-long flight, I'd also look into discount bus service. And try your search on other aggregator sites, such as Hipmunk. - C.S. Q: We love NYC and probably go once per year. We have an opportunity for a long weekend without the kids. I'm sure we'll build in Central Park time and bagels and lox in the the lower east side, but other than that, do you have any suggestions for non-touristy stuff to do? We've traipsed all over the usual places and done the usual things. A: Without the kids, you could totally go to the dark side (hello, Museum of Sex), but I will stay within our modest means. I suggest taking the ferry out to Governors Island, a playground of nature and art. You can also bike without worrying about crashing into a cab - no cars allowed. The Cloisters museum in Fort Tryon Park is also a unique experience without the usual Met crowds, and the Whitney just reopened in its new downtown location. You can also take the East River Ferry to Brooklyn, including DUMBO and Greenpoint, and Wall Street/Pier 11. For events/activities, check Time Out New York. - A.S. Q: Has anyone had experience with taking an aerosol can on a plane - either in carry-on or checked bag? I have a toiletry I like but it comes in aerosol can. I have a small travel size so wouldn't be taking a large can. I've heard you can take them but then was told that they may leak. A: Some aerosols, such as hairspray or shaving cream, can be carried aboard, although they must adhere to a 3.4 ounce limit. But other aerosols, such as insect spray, are not allowed. Check with the TSA for specifics. And I'd stick with carry-on to avoid radical pressure changes. - C.S. Q: It seems that car rental rates are much higher this summer than they used to be. For example, I'll be in Denver the weekend of Aug. 14-16 and the cheapest rental car rates are $50 per day, when in the past they have been about half that. Am I just unlucky or is this something happening more broadly? Page 3 of 3 - A: Actually, rental rates are the lowest they've been in two years, according to a recent survey. It may just be the market you're trying to rent in. - C.E.
