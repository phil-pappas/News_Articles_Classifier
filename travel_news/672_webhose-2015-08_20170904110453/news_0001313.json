Destination management companies from Seychelles such as Vision Voyages, Select-Seychelles, Masons Travel, Creole Travel Services, and 7°South also contributed to this trip. \n“With the Seychelles tourism office in the Middle East slowly climbing to the top, being the third feeder market to Seychelles with more than 10,000 visitors from the region for week 29, we gained a tremendous increase of 58% from January to July week ending - week 29 of July 2015 - on visitor arrivals compared to the same period last year for the United Arab Emirates region,” said Mr. Fathallah. \nThe agents were very happy to have this personal experience of Seychelles. With this, they will be able to relate and relay Seychelles to their clients on a more personal level, having known the dos and don’ts, and the best things to do while visiting the destination. \n“We are truly delighted with this development, and we are inspired to execute more of such trip activities, as this is truly beneficial for both parties - the agents having a great chance to enjoy and experience the island while also gaining knowledge on how best to sell the destination and its properties to their clients,” added Mr. Fathallah. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
