An application must be submitted four days in advance of arrival, will only be valid for 30 days, are single entry and cannot be extended. \nThe arrival of e-visas comes months after the Indian government backed down on plans that would have seen travellers make appointments at application centres across the UK for “biometric data collection”, where fingerprint data and facial imagery would have been a “mandatory requirement” for all visa applicants. \nTravellers entering India on an e-visa must arrive at one of 16 designated airports, which include Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. Biometric data, including fingerprinting, will be collected on arrival at the border. \nThe Indian government said e-Tourist visas are only valid for recreation, sightseeing, meeting friends or family, short duration medical treatment, or for a casual business visit. \nThe UK joins 77 other countries that are eligible for e-Tourist visas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:08:21.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
