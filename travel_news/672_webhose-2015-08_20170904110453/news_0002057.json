But in recent years it’s become much easier – the wires have disappeared, letting people print over wifi from all kinds of devices, such as tablets and phones, and software has become much more clever and easy to use.\nChoosing a printer is still fairly complicated though, with options including different printing technologies such as inkjet or laser — the latter of which is bigger, but faster and often cheaper — and machines designed to make the most of photos or to help you get as much printed out as quickly as possible. We’ve picked through the best on the market to help you get connected, whatever you’re looking to print.\n1. Brother MFC-J4620DW: £93.72, amazon.co.uk\nPriced like a consumer printer but kitted out like a business one, this is ideal for a small office or busy home. As well as working over wi-fi, it connects directly to mobile devices. The printing itself is fast and efficient, if not quite as bright or sharp as some.\nBuy now\n2. Samsung Xpress M2026W: £79.99, currys.co.uk\nLaser printers turn out fast, highquality black and white documents – but they can also be expensive to buy. This gives you laser advantages for a lower price, and you can print straight from your phone as well as over wi-fi.\nBuy now\n3. Canon Pixma iP110: £198.30, amazon.co.uk\nHighly portable, this is compact and rugged enough to throw into a bag and print from anywhere. The small size and the fact it’s batterypowered mean that it doesn’t boast all the features of other printers, but images are still good quality.\nBuy now\n4. Brother HL-L2365DW: £124, ebuyer.com\nHere’s one with all of the joys of laser printers — quick, high-quality printing — but in a compact package. Additionally, you still get the speed and detail of similarly priced models.\nBuy now\n5. Canon Pixma Pro-10S: £529.99, currys.co.uk\nIf you’re looking to print at professional quality – either for work purposes or to sell your prints – then Canon’s pro range will get the job done. It throws out beautiful photos and finely detailed text. As well as wi-fi, you can print directly from almost all devices.\nBuy now\n6. Epson Expression Home XP-425: £49.99, staples.co.uk\nThis lets you view and then print photos straight from Facebook using its built-in screen, making it super-simple to send your pictures to print. The prints are detailed and individual ink cartridges make this one cost-effective.\nBuy now\n7. Epson WorkForce Pro WF-5620dwf: £224, amazon.co.uk\nHere’s one that will print from pretty much any source and do it very quickly and efficiently. It’s fairly big and would be hard to hide out of sight, but that’s because it packs the performance and technology to power a small office.\nBuy now\n8. Dell B1265DFW: £163.91, ebuyer.com\nThis is a laser printer and so won’t turn out as fine pictures as some other models, but it will print fast, as well as scan and copy, and is built to withstand heavy office use.\nBuy now\n9. HP Envy 4500: £45, store.hp.com\nBuilt from the ground up to make the most of your photos, this is an excellent budget option. It gives rich colour, has great wireless capabilities and won’t break the bank – though you might have to spend more on cartridges because it’s not as ink-efficient as some.\nBuy now\n10. HP Deskjet 2540 All-In-One: £35, store.hp.com\nWith wireless connectivity and AirPrint to let you print straight from Apple devices, as well as a scanner and copier, this is a straightforward, good-value buy for basic needs. It doesn’t have the detail and speed of pricier models, but it does everything that you can ask of it at a reasonable price.\nBuy now\nVerdict:\nThe Epson Expression Home XP-425 is built from the bottom up to be easy-to-use and unobtrusive, as well as turning out great prints of pictures and text. The wireless options are comprehensive – allowing you to print pretty much anything from pretty much anywhere – and the pictures that come out the other side are finely-detailed.\nIf you’re looking for something to suit a business rather than a home, then the Epson WorkForce Pro WP-5620DWF will do the job perfectly. And if you’re looking for a laser printer rather than inkjet, the Dell B1265dfw will get you access to all the fine detail and speedy printing of that technology.\nRead more:\n10 best DSLRs\n10 best computer monitors", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PIXMA-iP110-Portable-Printer/dp/B00MWNDXQQ", "http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing-accessories/printers-ink/printers-scanners/inkjet-printers/canon-pixma-pro-10s-wireless-a3-inkjet-printer-10118611-pdt.html", "http://www.staples.co.uk/inkjet-printers/cbs/427761.html", "http://www.ebuyer.com/659225-brother-hl-l2365dw-a4-professional-compact-mono-laser-printer-30ppm-hll2365dwzu1", "http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/computing-accessories/printers-ink/printers-scanners/laser-printers/samsung-xpress-m2026w-monochrome-laser-printer-10132966-pdt.html", "http://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=A9U22B&opt=BHC&sel=PRN", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brother-MFC-J4620DW-Colour-Multifunction-Printer/dp/B00O0N1I54", "http://store.hp.com/UKStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=A9T80B&opt=BHC&sel=PRN", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/Epson-WorkForce-WF-5620DWF-Multifunction-Business/dp/B00J32UUHY", "http://www.ebuyer.com/542191-dell-b1265dfw-a4-multifunction-mono-wireless-laser-printer-210-aayt"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:14:11.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
