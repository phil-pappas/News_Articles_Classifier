RBA governor Glenn Stevens. Source: News Corp Australia\nThe seasonally adjusted July reading was higher than analysts’ expectations and followed a revised 6.1 per cent reading in June. The unemployment rate last reached 6.3 per cent in January this year and in October 2014, and before that in September 2002.\n“The broad story here if you look over the last 12 months, we’ve touched 6.3 per cent unemployment a few times,” JP Morgan senior economist Ben Jarman told AFP.\n“We’ll still in that range though admittedly at the top end of it. It’s a bit of a disappointing result in that context.” The Australian economy has chartered a rocky path as it exits from an unprecedented resources boom that has helped it avoid a recession.\nDespite the increase in the unemployment rate for July, analysts do not expect the Reserve Bank to shift in its outlook for the economy as it had previously forecast it to peak to around 6.5 per cent.\nThe central bank is due to release its quarterly reading of the economy in its Statement of Monetary Policy on Friday.\nOriginally published as Tough news for job seekers", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227472/816225-096ee47a-3bfc-11e5-9d7c-0b444e7ffab5.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/australias-jobless-rates-jumps-to-63/story-fnda1bsz-1227472816251"], "published": "2015-08-06T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:09:19.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
