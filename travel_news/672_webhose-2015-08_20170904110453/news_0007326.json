They turned to Legacy Building Solutions of Canada for a custom fabric structure on a rigid steel frame.\n\"Legacy was chosen because we were able to customize the new venue to meet the River Cree Resort and Casino's exact demands,\" said Jim Kumpula , general manager of Legacy Building Solutions Canada. \"Our fast-track process means that the building will be ready for events within about four months, far less time than most builders can manage.\"\nThe new multi-purpose event centre will be 140 x 220 feet, with an additional lean-to for a full bar and additional storage. There will be a second-floor mezzanine with box seating, total capacity of up to 2,500, washrooms and a foyer with an indoor connection to the River Cree Resort and Casino.\nThe project is being delivered by Legacy Building Solutions of Canada as a construction management project.\nAbout Legacy Building Solutions of Canada\nLegacy Building Solutions of Canada is a custom designer, manufacturer and installer of engineered custom fabric structures.
