TDGVA measures the value added of different industries in relation to tourism activities of both foreign and domestic visitors in the country. \nTotal earnings from inbound tourism in 2014 amounted to $4.84 billion, higher by 10 percent against the previous year’s earnings of $4.4 billion. In peso value, inbound revenues totaled to P214.88 billion, higher by 15 percent compared to P186.15 billion in 2013. \nDespite being a high impact economic activity, a major job generator and key export sector accounting for six percent of total world trade, tourism receives only 0.78 percent of the total Aid for Trade (AfT) disbursements and a mere 0.097 percent of the total Official Development Assistance (ODA), the UN organization said. \n“As we move forward to adopt a new sustainable development agenda, we have a unique opportunity to raise the level of assistance in tourism to further harness its vast potential for stimulating green growth and inclusive development worldwide, particularly for the countries most in need,” Rifai added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T22:40:20.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
