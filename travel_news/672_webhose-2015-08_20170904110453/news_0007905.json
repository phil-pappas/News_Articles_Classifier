You can just get lost in the images and the more you look at them, the more you see.\" Twelve years as a white-water rafting guide saw Gareth tackling the world's largest and most formidable rivers in Europe, New Zealand, Canada, the US, Iceland, Peru and Australia where he developed his divine passion for photography. \nGareth bought his first camera in Iceland 10 years ago as a way to document his travel experiences and capture the scenic beauty he was surrounded by. \n\"After spending years travelling through beautiful countries and not recording it, I thought it was about time to start,\" he said. \nHowever, his instinctually adventurous nature and a string of serendipitous events led Gareth's photography to become his lifeblood and career. \nThe vibrant detail of Gareth's photographs are in part due to his adept ability at using a large format 5x4 inch slide camera: an unforgiving medium normally reserved for professionals. \nGareth made the move to the large format camera in 2006 after growing frustrated by the confines of 35mm digital photography, prioritising quality over practicality. \nAlthough these cameras are slower, bulkier and more difficult to use, Gareth says that this format allows him to take huge landscape photographs with unrivalled detail and beauty. \n\"The sharpness and detail of large-scale format is second to none,\" Gareth said. \n\"It allows you to see things you don't even notice in person.\" \nAs the photography industry is notoriously difficult to crack, Gareth's career is a feat within itself, establishing successful galleries in both Cairns and Melbourne before setting up shop on the Coast. \nStill settling in and awaiting a third child, he is set to branch out his business and begin professional photography tours by early next year where he will be able to pass on his wealth of knowledge and experience to clients. \nVisit http://www.garethkelly.com for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:13:27.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
