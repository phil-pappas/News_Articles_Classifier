His white hair partially hidden under a straw hat, the man says he’s taken part in Costa Rica’s annual pilgrimage, known as the romería , at least 20 times to give thanks for what he calls “the miracle of life.”\nSomewhere behind him in the moving crowd is a tired-eyed college student who said she’s walking to fulfill a promise to her cancer-stricken mother. She has been trekking the romería three days after leaving from San Carlos in Alajuela with a group of friends.\nOthers come from even farther to make good on different types of promises, such as Franklin Arturo Garita Quirós, from Paquera, Puntarenas, who was sued by the Environment Ministry in 1986 after he was accused of deforesting his property. He made a promise to the Virgin of Los Ángeles, known as “ la negrita , ” that if he won the case, he would walk every year to her statue in Cartago, as he’s done for the past 29 years.\nThese are just three pilgrims among the estimated 2 million who make the journey to the Basílica, each carrying their own reasons to pay respects to the virgin. They’re drawn in by her tiny stone effigy, which is swallowed in an elaborate frame of jewels and gold at the front of the auric-domed church. Once inside the ornate Basílica, many travelers get on their knees and inch their way up to the alter, where the virgin remains protected under a glass case.\nIn honor of the Day of the Virgin of Los Ángeles on Sunday, The Tico Times has put together the following photo report to chronicle the pilgrims’ unique and extraordinary paths to Cartago.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico times\nA vendor along the route sells natural juice and fruit during the 2015 Romería on August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nRosaries for sale at the 2015 Romería, August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nA few of the pilgrims sprinted their way to the Basilica de los Ángeles in Cartago, during the 2015 Romería, on August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nStopping for water along the way during the 2015 Romería, August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nA pilgrim takes a break for a quick calf massage during the 2015 Romería, August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nThe Basílica de los Ángeles in Cartago.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nPilgrims enter the Basílica de los Ángeles on their knees during the 2015 Romería on August 1, 2015.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nLa Negrita is displayed inside the Basílica de los Ángeles.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nA pilgrim prays to La Negrita to cure a sick family member during the 2015 Romería, on August 1, 2015, in Costa Rica.\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times\nAlberto Font/The Tico times\nAlberto Font/The Tico Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:15:32.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
