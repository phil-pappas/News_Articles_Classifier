But in southeast England? It’s a novel diversion from London. The 600-acre safari park Port Lympne Reserve in Kent hosts lions, cheetahs, giraffes and gorillas, and last month it opened the Treehouse Hotel for visitors to dwell among them. Ten two-bedroom suites with kitchens and balconies furnished like living rooms aren’t literally built in a tree but are perched high on a rise overlooking a pastoral rhino enclosure. Channeling the film “Out of Africa,” the British designer Tara Bernerd cast the loftlike interiors in the muted gray and khaki tones of the savanna. Each treehouse cabin includes a golf cart for tooling around safe areas of the park independently, and access to Howletts, another nearby wildlife park. Both are run by the nonprofit Aspinall Foundation, which directs proceeds from the parks to animal research, breeding and conservation. Treehouse rates start at £500 ($762) through September and at £300 ($457) beginning in October. SAFARIS BY AIR IN AUSTRALIA The vast distances between Outback locales in Australia have inspired a tour style there known as the “air safari,” essentially place-to-place cruises across the continent via private aircraft. One such operator, Air Adventure, has just introduced two itineraries focused on food. The more extensive, seven-day High Fliers Gourmet Trail itinerary with a partner tour operator, Ultimate Winery Experiences, links wine regions including the Barossa Valley in South Australia, Yarra Valley and Mornington Peninsula in Victoria and the Freycinet Peninsula in Tasmania (10,532 Australian dollars, about $7.850, per person, all-inclusive). For a quick taste of jet-setting, the company is also offering the Great Wagyu Adventure , a one-day trip from Melbourne to a Coonawarra region winery and a Wagyu beef ranch. A wine blending class and four-course lunch precede the flight back above the Great Ocean Road in view of the limestone sea stacks known as the Twelve Apostles (1,190 Australian dollars, or $887, per person). WATER FIGHTS ON THE HIGH SEAS Royal Caribbean International has announced the addition of a new, amped up water park called Splashaway Bay on its new ship Harmony of the Seas , launching next May. While others among its mega ships have geysers and fountains, the next-generation water park will feature drench buckets, water cannons and slides, including what it says is the tallest slide at sea, the 100-foot Ultimate Abyss. Designed for toddlers to preteens, Splashaway Bay promises slides that spiral down five decks above the landscaped interior of the ship known as Central Park. The new 5,497-passenger Harmony of the Seas will spend next summer in the Mediterranean before moving to Caribbean itineraries in November 2016. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:10:47.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
