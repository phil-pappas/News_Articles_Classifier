AUL Corp has been awarded the second year in a row. AUL Corp is a Vehicle Service Contract company founded in Napa, California , in 1990 by Luis Nieves , president and CEO. AUL has 117 employees in its downtown Napa offices and hundreds of agents across the country selling its products.\n\"This is truly an honor. This award recognizes the people of AUL who work so hard on behalf of our agents, dealers, and contract holders,\" said Mr. Nieves, who also noted, \"the passion of the team is evident each day, and our visitors always comment on how open and inviting the atmosphere is.\"\nOne area that AUL has focused on in the last few years is giving back to the community. A charitable committee designed and run by the employees reviews causes and charities brought to it from within AUL and makes the decisions. The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Light the Night Walk, Hands Across the Valley, and NAPA C.A.S.A. are a few examples of the organizations the committee supports.\n\"A few years ago we made the commitment to our charitable committee and placed no restraints on them except for them to use their good judgment,\" said Chief Operating Officer Jimmy Atkinson . \"They have been great stewards of our resources along with making a difference in our community. We believe that is an extension of our commitment to our AUL team.\"\nEmployees are encouraged to find ways to demonstrate \"The AUL Way\" as a set of core values developed by the team. \"While some are expected, like Honest, Committed, and Transparent, others allow our unique culture to shine, like Fun, Different and Creative,\" said Nieves. Another core value is Appreciative, which truly sums up Mr. Nieves' approach to business and life. \"Anyone who meets Luis knows that they have encountered a special person,\" said Atkinson. \"His dedication to others and true pleasure in seeing people succeed is one of the key ingredients to our success in business and with our employees' dedication to our company.\"\nAbout the NBBJ Awards\nThe North Bay Business Journal is celebrating their 10th year awarding the Best Places to Work in the North Bay.
