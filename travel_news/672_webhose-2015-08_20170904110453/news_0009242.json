Don't let the gloomy weather ruin your vacation when the Hamptons offers plenty of good times to be had indoors. From Southampton to Montauk, here are some ideas to turn your day around.\nClimb the Montauk Point Lighthouse tower (Credit: Gordon M. Grant) Montauk Point Lighthouse, the oldest in New York State, was commissioned under George Washington in 1792 and is still aiding navigation more than 200 years later. Climb to the top ($10 adults, $4 younger than 12), tour the museum and explore the grounds and trails of adjacent Camp Hero, a decommissioned military installation turned state park. Note: The tower is sometimes closed during severe weather.\nExplore East End history and culture (Credit: Gordon M. Grant) See where two of the East End's most celebrated husband-and-wife artists, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, lived and worked, including the barn studio where Pollock's drip paintings were executed. The Pollock-Krasner House & Study Center in Springs is open 1-5 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays, June through August.\nAnd that's just the beginning. The Hamptons are full of museums that celebrate its rich history, including the Sag Harbor Whaling & Historical Museum at 200 Main St. in Sag Harbor; Home Sweet Home Museum at 14 James Lane in East Hampton; and the Children's Museum of the East End at 376 Bridgehampton/Sag Harbor Tpke. in Bridgehampton.\nIndulge in some of the Hamptons' homemade ice cream (Credit: Ian J. Stark)\nEven when the weather is chilly, it's hard to resist ice cream in some of these local shops.\nIf you want a taste of the old school, the Candy Kitchen is the place to go. Not much has changed since it opened in 1925 -- you'll notice the chrome ice cream counter, vinyl booths ... and that credit cards still aren't accepted. The ice cream is homemade, often with local fruit. It's at 2391 Montauk Hwy.\nThe owners Jim and Nicoletta Parash also opened the Sip 'n Soda on Hampton Road in Southampton in 1958, and it's still run by Jim and Nicoletta's sons and grandson. All ice cream is made on the premises with a \"secret recipe\" that the family claims has never been written down. Sip 'n Soda is at 40 Hampton Rd. in Southampton.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE Tour Hamptons breweries (Credit: Erin Geismar) Montauk Brewing Co., at 62 S. Erie Ave. in Montauk, was founded by three East Hampton locals and it's the newest craft beer on the Hamptons scene. The tasting room is open daily from noon to 8 p.m.\nPlus, check out the veteran Hamptons craft brewer at the Southampton Publick House, at 40 Bowden Square in Southampton, which is also a full-service restaurant.\nPamper yourself at a Hamptons spa (Credit: Gurney's Montauk Resort and Seawater Spa) Trade in your beach chair for a massage table and keep right on relaxing. Local spas include La Carezza Salon d√£ Spa at 43-45 Windmill Lane in Southampton; Naturopathica Spa at 74 Montauk Hwy. in East Hampton; or Gurney's Resort and Seawater Spa at 290 Old Montauk Hwy. in Montauk. Gurney's features a special seawater pool with water drawn directly from Montauk's beaches (pictured). You must book a spa service to use the pool and other spa facilities.\nCozy up to a fireplace (Credit: Cape Resorts) When it's wet and chilly in the Hamptons, head indoors to an East End bar or restaurant with a fireplace. Baron's Cove, in Sag Harbor, has three including one on the outdoor patio (pictured); 1770 House in East Hampton is also among those with a fireplace.\nFireplaces aside, take the rain as an excuse to check out one of the East End's newest restaurants. Find 21 picks here .\nGo to the movies (Credit: Ian J. Stark) Escape the dreary weather outside by enjoying a movie in one of the East End's movie theaters, which include Hampton Arts Cinema at 2 Brook Rd. in Westhampton Beach (pictured); UA Hampton Bays 5 at 119 W. Montauk Hwy. in Hampton Bays; UA Southampton 4 at 43 Hill St. in Southampton; UA East Hampton 6 at 30 Main St. in East Hampton; and Sag Harbor Cinema at 90 Main St. in Sag Harbor.\nSee a Roy Lichtenstein sculpture (and more) at Parrish Art Museum (Credit: Catherine Michelle Bartlett) Parrish Art Museum, at 279 Montauk Hwy. in Water Mill, houses modern American art with a focus on artists from the East End of Long Island. Among its visiting exhibits is \"Tokyo Brushstroke I & II,\" large sculptures by Roy Lichtenstein that greet visitors at the museum entrance. The museum is closed on Tuesdays; admission is free on Wednesdays.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISE HERE Go wine tasting (yes, the Hamptons has vineyards, too) (Credit: Gordon M. Grant) If the rain is robbing you of the East End's sandy beaches, you might as well take advantage of some of the other things the area has to offer -- local wines. The South Fork of Long Island is home to three vineyards: Channing Daughters Winery at 1927 Scuttle Hole Rd. in Bridgehampton; Duck Walk Vineyards at 231 Montauk Hwy. in Water Mill; and the tasting room at Wolffer Estate Vineyard at 139 Sagg Rd. in Sagaponack (pictured July 17, 2015).\nWhy not head to the beach, anyway? (Credit: Gordon M. Grant ) Sure, it's raining, but the beach may still be open even if swimming is prohibited. \"If you're going to get wet in the water anyway, what's the difference?\" said John Ryan, chief lifeguard for the Town of East Hampton. At guarded beaches in the Town of East Hampton, lifeguards are on duty rain or shine and the beaches stay open until they witness thunder or lightening or another safety concern, Ryan said. But be aware of the flag system -- a yellow flag means swimmers should take caution when entering the water, and a red flag means swimming is prohibited due to high surf and dangerous rip currents. Above, lifeguards make their way to the beach at Atlantic Avenue Beach in Amagansett on June 10, 2014.\nFind information on all of Long Island's 110 beaches by clicking here .\nLike it?
