The return service departs San Jose at 20.00 to arrive at Heathrow at 14.05 the following day. \nThe 787-9 will feature four cabins with eight seats in First, 42 seats in Club World, 39 in World Traveller Plus and 127 in economy. \nThe announcement comes after BA unveiled new routes from Gatwick to Peru and Costa Rica both starting in May 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:45:59.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
