I am primarily interested in photographic opportunities, but have been unable to find any photo tours for those dates. Will I be able to get to some scenic places in North Sikkim, or will there be too much snow? I would love to get a view of Kanchenjunga as well..Reading through some of the forum posts, I am encouraged that it would be possible to get around.. I live in the US, and my brother is in Delhi. Being a US citizen now (but have a OCI card), are there areas of Sikkim that would be off limits for me? I was thinking of renting a 4WD and a driver for the entire duration. Would it be better to book this in Delhi or at the airport in Bagdogra? Also, any opinion on this versus going to Ladakh instead? Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
