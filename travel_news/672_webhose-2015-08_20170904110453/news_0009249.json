Well, his second home at the studio, at least. As part of a special collaboration with Airbnb, the Korean superstar will be hosting a sleepover at the Dukyang studio — where G-Dragon kickstarted his career and has trained for years — for five lucky fans picked from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. \nAccording to his listing, G-Dragon mentioned that Dukyang Studio “is filled with my memories from more than 10 years of music and dance training” and he will be transforming it into a “home” by filling it up with stuff that inspires him, from music to toys. \nBesides that, G-Dragon will personally be there to check the winners in and introduce his favourite spots in Seoul before “an intimate” at YG cafeteria (made famous by variety shows such as Running Man). The five guests will then post a review on their Airbnb accounts. \n“I’m thrilled to become a host on Airbnb and I’m excited about welcoming my fans into my second home. I look forward to providing them with a unique local experience by sharing a glimpse into the early years of my career and bringing them around the neighbourhood I grew up in”, said G-Dragon. \nSaid Patrick Lee, Airbnb’s country manager for Korea: “Our hosts have always been the driving force behind our community and we are honoured to have superstar G-Dragon exemplify this mission that we are so passionate about by becoming a superhost on Airbnb. We are excited that an icon of popculture like G-Dragon shares our vision of making the world a smaller place.” \nAfter a series of Night At contests which include staying at locations such as a KLM Plane and The Esplanade, this is Airbnb’s first celebrity Night At where a celebrity will be interacting with the winners. — TODAY \n*For more details about the contest, visit www.airbnb.com.sg/gdragon  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T03:56:20.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
