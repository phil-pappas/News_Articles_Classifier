Served from 7.30am until 10am at The Real Mary King Close recently opened café, The Royal Exchange Coffee House, guests can opt for a full Scottish or continental breakfast, or a filled breakfast roll. \nFor visitors who prefer to have breakfast in their apartment, The Real Mary King’s Close is providing a breakfast pack which can be pre booked and delivered to their apartment or a breakfast delivery service of filled morning rolls delivered to the reception area of Old Town Chambers. Julie Grieve, CEO of Lateral City, said: “Our guests like having the freedom a serviced apartment brings, but sometimes they may prefer not to make breakfast. By teaming up with The Real Mary King’s Close, breakfast is literally on their doorstep and with a variety of options they’re set up for their day exploring the capital.” Rod Nisbet, Food and Beverage Manager at The Real Mary King’s Close, said: “We are really excited about this exclusive breakfast offering with Old Town Chambers.
