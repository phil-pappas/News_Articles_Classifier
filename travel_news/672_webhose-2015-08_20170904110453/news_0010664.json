That's a subjective cultural claim, certainly, but it's also an empirical truth – because it's geology that has created our diverse and extraordinary natural wonders. We owe the creation of vertiginous cliffs and sea stacks to deposits of sandstone and chalk; soft limestone has been etched and scoured to carve craggy gorges, coastal arches and echoing caverns; and sculpted from extrusions of volcanic basalt are the weirdly geometric columns of causeways and sea caves.\nBut if science speak doesn't thrill you, the sheer wildness of our landscapes can't fail to enthral. The UK's wonders may not top the lists of the tallest, deepest, widest or loudest in the world, but the canyons are grand, the waterfalls dramatic and the coastline is, frankly, as spectacular as any. And yet, we rarely celebrate these natural marvels. Typical British reticence, perhaps, though another factor might be the weather – of which we have plenty. Indeed, the power tools that cut and shaped these masterpieces are largely meteorological. It is waves, wind, rain and ice that have moulded our land.\n\"The UK is one of the most varied regions in the world, geologically speaking,\" says Joe Cornish, a landscape photographer whose new book, This Land (published 1 October), showcases Britain's most beautiful scenery. \"And thanks to the auspicious location of this gnarly, ancient chunk of rock in the path of the Gulf Stream, we also enjoy some of the most varied and interesting weather conditions.\"\nNatural wonders in the UK \nBut while extreme weather is great for forging natural wonders, it can make reaching them trickier – which is why now is the time to explore, while access is generally easier and more comfortable than in winter. Most of our most magnificent sights are best enjoyed on a self-powered expedition.\nThe UK's extensive network of public footpaths provides access to most of our most amazing spectacles, and 15 waymarked National Trails of England and Wales ( nationaltrail.co.uk ) take in many of the most impressive natural monuments.\nPlanning your own hike is straightforward, but several companies offer supported or guided holidays along sections of these routes; Macs Adventure (0141 530 8886; macsadventure.com ) has a comprehensive roster of self-guided tours, while Ramblers Worldwide Holidays (01707 331133; ramblersholidays.co.uk ) offers walking trips highlighting our geological marvels.\nMany of the trails can be traced by bike or on horseback, while other spots are best appreciated from the water – on a boat tour, paddling a kayak or even bobbing beneath cliffs on a coasteering excursion.\nSome, though, can be admired from the comfort of a warm cottage, hotel or bar – the National Trust (0344 335 1287; nationaltrustholidays.org.uk ) and Landmark Trust (01628 825925; landmarktrust.org.uk ) both have enticing arrays of holiday properties with views of mountains, cliffs and crags.\nWhat's guaranteed is that seeing our natural wonders will set your shutter finger itching. Charlie Waite, founder of the Landscape Photographer of the Year competition ( take-a-view.co.uk ) and the specialist photography tour operator Light and Land (01747 824727; lightandland.co.uk ), is evangelical about the idea.\n\"In the context of the world, we are not a physically large country but the variety and beauty of our landscapes is second to none, from the limestone scenery of the Yorkshire Dales to the basalt columns of Fingal's Cave on the isle of Staffa,\" he says. \"And the camera is a wonderful conduit through which one can connect with the myriad natural wonders.\"\nNorthern Ireland \nThe Giant's Causeway in Co Antrim consists of more than 40,000 hexagonal basalt columns which were formed when magma spurted through cracks in the Earth's surface 60 million years ago.
