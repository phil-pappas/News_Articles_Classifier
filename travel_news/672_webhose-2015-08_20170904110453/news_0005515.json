Saudi Arabia issued development bonds worth 15 billion riyals in June as well, its first sovereign issuance since 2007. More multibillion debt sales could follow in the coming months, the SPA said.\nSaudi Arabia’s debt issuance comes as the kingdom and the other oil-exporting economies of the Persian Gulf are contending with the fallout of lower oil prices that have sunk below $50, roughly half of what they were at a year ago. Oil revenue makes up for most of the budget income of these countries, or close to 90% in the case of Saudi Arabia.\nUntil now, most of the Persian Gulf states have opted to continue spending on infrastructure to spur economic growth. That reluctance to cut spending comes at the cost of widening deficits and increasing budgetary strains.\nThe International Monetary Fund recently said Saudi Arabia is likely to run a fiscal deficit of about 20% of its gross domestic product, or about $150 billion, this year. Economic growth, meanwhile, will hover around 3.5% this year but weaken in 2016, the IMF said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-issues-bonds-worth-5-billion-to-plug-budget-shortfall-1439305126?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:22:56.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
