POSTED: 18 Aug 2015 18:12 UPDATED: 19 Aug 2015 00:34 A \nSINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA), Jetstar Asia and Tigerair will waive fees for customers wanting to change flights to and from Bangkok following the bombing that rocked the Thai capital on Monday evening (Aug 17). \n\"In light of the current situation in Bangkok, Singapore Airlines will waive fees for re-bookings or re-routings for customers holding confirmed tickets on SIA flights arriving in or departing from Bangkok,\" an SIA spokesman said on Tuesday in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia. \nThe waiver by SIA is valid for tickets issued on or before Aug 18, 2015 for travel to/from Bangkok up to Sep 17, 2015. Passengers who take advantage of the waiver should arrange to make a new trip by Oct 30, 2015, the airline said. \nJetstar Asia said its customers are entitled to make changes to their bookings over the next week. Change fees and fare differences will be waived. To make changes, customers should contact call centres or their travel agents, it added. \nThose who have purchased tickets with Tigerair and originally scheduled to fly to Bangkok between Aug 18 and Sep 17 will be able to make changes to their flight date and destination without being penalised, the budget airline said. \nLow-cost carrier Scoot also said it will waive the change fees for re-bookings or a change in destination. \"The waiver is valid for tickets issued on or before Aug 17, 2015 and for travel up to Sep 17, 2015. Any fare difference arising from such changes will still apply,\" the airline said. \nIt added that customers who have bought a Scoot ticket to Bangkok but do not wish to travel have the option of using ChangYourFlight to obtain a partial refund, in the form of a Scoot travel voucher. \nSIA, Jetstar, Tigerair and Thai AirAsia said their flights between Singapore and Bangkok are operating as scheduled. - CNA/dl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:39:53.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
