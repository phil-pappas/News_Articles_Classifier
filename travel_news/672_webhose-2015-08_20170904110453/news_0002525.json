This represents a 20.6-percent increase from the same month last year.\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy are still the main sources of foreign visitors in the first quarter, and all of them have witnessed a growth of between 10 percent and 28 percent in the number of tourists to the island country.\nThree Latin American countries — Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico — trailed behind the above European states. Among them, Venezuela has seen the biggest increase, or 61.5 percent, in the number of visitors in the first half of 2015.\nThe notable increase in tourists visiting Cuba came after the historic diplomatic rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, which was announced in December 2014.\nEven though the ONEI did not mention the number of U.S. holidaymakers, they are likely to increase as U.S. President Barack Obama loosened travel restrictions in January, which, as part of a U.S. blockade policy, are still in force for U.S. citizens who want to visit Cuba.\nTourism is the Caribbean island’s second source of foreign exchange earners, which stood at more than 1.8 billion U.S. dollars.\nIn 2014, Cuba received a record three million tourists, an increase of 5.5 percent over 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:22:22.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
