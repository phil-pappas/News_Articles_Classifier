The holiday this year [2015] falls on Sunday 27 September. \nFully 2 months before the Moon Festival, press releases start to arrive in the inboxes of journalists, food critics, and travel writers extolling the virtues of the moon cakes produced by various hotels and restaurants around Hong Kong. \nAbout one month before the holiday, moon cakes start going on sale. At the Peninsula Hong Kong, for example, the on-line ordering of mooncakes begins at 8 am on Monday 24 August and continues for 5 days. \n\"This online ordering platform will be suspended once the allotted daily number of boxes is sold out,\" the 5 star hotel's website says. \nMoon Cakes 101 Fook Moon Lam Grand Gift Set.

According to legend, the moon is brightest - and roundest - on this date. \nBoxes of moon cakes are often given as presents to relatives, friends, and business associates, and they can be downright pricey! \nMoon cakes are round pastries with a thick filling enveloped by a thin crust. Fillings vary from region to region. \nThe moon cakes most popular in Hong Kong and neighboring Guangdong province usually have a filling made from red beans with a salted duck's egg yolk in the middle. They pack a whopping 1,000 calories! \nMoon cakes in other parts of China feature fillings made of various other ingredients including lotus seed paste, nuts and seeds, and sometimes dried meat. \nDurian Moon Cakes Moon cake with a durian ice cream filling and a chocolate crust.

The eatery is launching a moon cake this year made with Durian ice-cream. \nThe hotel's Executive Pastry Chef Danny Ho is combining fresh durian, known as the King of Fruits, with French dairy products to produce this limited edition moon cake. \nThree types of durian are used: Musang King, dense D24, and sweet D101, which are shipped direct from Malaysia. The ice-cream itself is composed of 80% pure durian fruit. \nOther ingredients include fresh vanilla seed, cream, butter, and cream cheese from France as well as chocolate from Switzerland. \nGreen Tea Moon Cakes Red Bean in Green Tea Pastry Moon Cakes.

The eatery is launching a new flavour this year: Red Bean in Green Tea Pastry on top of Egg Yolk Custard. \nComment and Analysis \nSignature moon cakes. Photo Credit: Fook Moon Lam. \n\nI have never been a big fan of Cantonese style moon cakes. They are heavy, the taste is a bit harsh, and I find that salty duck's eggyolk in the middle a bit revolting. \nWhen I discovered just how fattening they were - 1,000 calories, are you kidding me? - I was convinced that there were better things I could spend my calories on. \nI prefer the Northern Chinese moon cakes with the nut and seed fillings. Best of all are those Haagen-Dazs moon cakes that are filled with French vanilla ice cream and a scoop of mango sorbet (in lieu of the egg yolk) and coated with chocolate. \nIf I'm going to indulge, those are more my cup of tea. And they go PERFECT with a nice cup of coffee!!! \nTalking Points \nHave you ever tried moon cakes?
