Southbound travelers will still see two exit lanes at Denny Way, while two lanes continue through the old Battery Street Tunnel onto the Alaskan Way Viaduct.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid Dave Sowers, Highway 99 deputy administrator for the Washington State Department of Transportation, predicts minor slowdowns early next week, because the curve offers a potentially distracting view of the future deep-bore tunnel entrance.\n“There will be some rubberneckers who will try to look into the portals, so people will need a little time to get used to that,” Sowers said.\nWhen the Highway 99 tunnel is completed, bypassing downtown, this curved overpass will become the connection between Aurora and downtown surface streets.\nAtkinson Construction is on schedule and budget with its $41 million contract to build the north-side tunnel approach . That’s not the case for the main $1.35 billion contract with Seattle Tunnel Partners, whose drilling machine Bertha is being repaired, following its breakdown Dec. 6, 2013. It is estimated that the deep-bore tunnel will open in March 2018.\nIf Bertha had arrived on schedule, for a planned December 2015 tunnel opening, this kink in Aurora would need to exist only a few months. But because of delays, the Aurora Avenue curve will remain until perhaps early 2018.\nThe section of Aurora at South Lake Union will close from 10 p.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Monday.\nMike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com .
