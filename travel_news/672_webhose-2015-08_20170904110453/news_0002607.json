Its 2014 Theme Index indicates that attendance rose 4.1% to 2014 from 2013. Attendance at parks in Asia rose 5%, while amusement-park attendance rose 3% in Europe and 2% in the U.S. \n\"Worldwide attendance continues to rise,\" said Arthur Levine, a theme-park expert who pens a column for About.com . \"Companies such as Comcast ( CMCSA - Get Report ) , which was expected to sell off the parks when it acquired NBCUniversal, instead are pouring tons of capital into the parks and reaping huge rewards. The future looks exceptionally bright for the industry.\" \nTechnological innovations are transforming the amusement-park industry and enthralling tourists all over the globe. Rides have become more sophisticated, special effects have intensified, and the theme-park experience has become increasingly participatory and immersive. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \n\"There is greater and greater blending of technologies in theme parks.

The park is expected to be spectacular and a one-of-a-kind blended cultural experience. \n\"As the industry gets more international, even the bigger players, and especially the bigger players, are learning to be more culturally sensitive than the first time around,\" said Judith Rubin, a spokeswoman for the Themed Entertainment Association. \nNo matter the inspiration, innovation or location, at the core of the amusement-park industry remains one central goal: enjoyment. \n\"The market has evolved through several generations into much more of an active, participatory market, but the idea of passive involvement in experiences is still very much appreciated,\" said Rick Rothschild, a theme-park entertainment consultant and former executive show director at Disney. \"How do we actively engage our audience at different levels in different ways to increase their enjoyment or their experience?\" \nTheStreet polled a handful of industry experts for their opinions on the most alluring amusement parks in the world.
