The new structure, the third in Boeing’s existing campus, will open in summer 2016 and house employees working in engineering, research and development laboratories, and some support staff.\nDuring the groundbreaking ceremony Global Services & Support (GS&S) President Leanne Caret announced that headquarters for GS&S’ Aircraft Modernization and Sustainment (AM&S) division would move to Oklahoma City in the months ahead. This decision transfers approximately a dozen senior management positions to Oklahoma City and reflects the site’s importance to the company.\n“We see a bright horizon for the aircraft sustainment business because of the highly trained and motivated workforce we have in Oklahoma City,” said Caret. “Expanding our presence and bringing AM&S headquarters here continues a trend of combining Oklahoma’s home-grown talent with the best of the enterprise to support some of our customers’ most critical missions.”\nOklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin participated in the event and described its importance. “Business growth is critical for both Oklahoma and Boeing. Your decision to place key leadership positions here underscores the long-term nature of our partnership. Today’s announcement will help solidify our position as a premiere destination for the aerospace industry,” said Gov. Fallin.\nAircraft Modernization and Sustainment provides support and modernization services for U.S. and coalition lift, executive transport, airborne refueling, airborne command and control, and global strike capabilities. This includes commercial derivative aircraft, airborne early warning and control platforms, C-17 Globemaster III maintenance, tanker maintenance and support, and bomber/weapons modernization and logistics.\nSource:- Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:41:26.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
