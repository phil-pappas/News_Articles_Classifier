At Four Seasons Hotel Rtiz Lisbon, the impossibly suave, lantern-jawed Luís Mendes, Bar Manager at the Ritz Bar, thoroughly researches his new approaches to established cocktails, using his roots and his travels to inspire his creations. Local and top-shelf ingredients are his thing, and he loves to defy the rules and find new ways to serve, entertain and host his guests at the Ritz Bar as if in his own home.\nThe Old Fashioned was the first cocktail Luís learned how to make. He still remembers holding a copy of Mr. Boston, every bartender’s favourite drink-mixing guide, in his hands for the first time when he was just a teenager. He has since perfected the technique, and is comfortable making it in any situation. His new take on the classic cocktail is a result of years of practice, experience and hard work, and one can really see it in his “moves” as he prepares the drink.\nLuís chose award-winning Bulleit Frontier Bourbon Whiskey for his Smoky Oaky Old-Fashioned. He considers the amber-coloured bourbon whiskey with gentle spiciness and sweet oak aromas to be the perfect blend for his Old Fashioned with a twist, and likes that it is family-produced in small batches. He goes on to explain that the mid-palate is smooth with tones of maple, oak and nutmeg, whilst the finish is long, dr, and satiny with a light toffee flavour – just the unparalleled complexity he needs.\nThe main distinguishing feature of Luís’ Old Fashioned is that the glass is smoked, and the wood chips are used to artificially age the bourbon, intensifying its original oaky flavour, as well as the orange bitters that will further highlight the natural flavours. The smoking of the glass is also a bit of a show (how very Don Draper of him!), giving Luís an opportunity to engage with clients, and make the whole experience that much more memorable. The smell alone will leave anyone longing to take a sip of this 19th century drink.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:16:21.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
