Volaris’ total demand for July measured in Revenue Passenger Miles (RPMs) increased 17.3% year over year, reaching 1.2 billion. \nResponding to strong passenger demand, Volaris increased international ASMs by 44.7%, while maintaining capacity discipline to more opportunistically increase ASMs in the domestic market by only 7.8%.
