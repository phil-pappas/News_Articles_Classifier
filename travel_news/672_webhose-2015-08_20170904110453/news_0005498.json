However they are now ready to welcome visitors again,” he said. \nNamvar-Motlaq pointed to the establishment of new markets to offer handicrafts in large cities like Tehran. \n“We plan to launch a new handicraft market in Tehran's historic neighborhood Udlajan in the near future,” he added. \n“Handicraft industry in Iran earns the country a huge income through exports rather than sales to the tourists; however we are not passive toward tourism boom in the Islamic Republic,” he stated. \nDuring the conference, the director of CHTHO’s Handicraft Exports Department Puya Mahmudian pointed to some activities of department for handicrafts marketing in different parts of the world. \n“Due to the sanctions, Iran could not export handicrafts to the U.S. and the UK but now the countries are among the main targets of Iran for exporting handicrafts,” she said. \nShe said that Iran also plans to hold expos in China and Russia to enter the five major emerging national economies named Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) markets as well. \n“European Union and Persian Gulf countries were traditional markets for Iranian handicrafts and we plan to have more exports to those regions,” she added. \nCHTHO plans to provide a handicraft auction hall and some facilities for exportation of handicrafts at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport so entrepreneurs can attend the auctions without obtaining visa, she announced. \nMahmudian also said special handicraft showrooms have been established at CHTHO’s Handicraft Department for receiving orders by foreign trade delegations who visit Iran. \nIran is placed among top three handicrafts producers in the world and is ranked 30th in handicraft exports. Iran’s handicrafts exports rose by 40 percent last year compared to its preceding year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:53:22.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
