Under the green canopy of cypress trees dripping with Spanish moss, dappled sunlight highlighted snapping turtles basking along the banks on stumps and rocks. Paddling around the bend, we spied a different reptile doing the same thing - a 10-foot-long alligator. We came to central Florida in search of the state's heritage and authenticity, and this gator was no theme park prop.\nGreater Orlando was transformed into a major global tourist destination when Disney World opened in 1971, bringing a host of other man-made attractions. But the region boasted its own unique Floridian history long before Mickey Mouse started gobbling up land. It survived just down the road in the old-fashioned town of Kissimmee, population 60,000.\nAbout 10 miles east of Disney World, Kissimmee found its distinctiveness eclipsed by the rampant resort growth that followed the Magic Kingdom's debut. U.S. Route 192, which skirts the downtown, became cluttered with chain motels, fast-food restaurants, and T-shirt shops. But Kissimmee now is reasserting its heritage-rich identity.\nHistorically, these environs were cattle country - and still are. Cattle were introduced to the Americas by way of Florida almost 400 years ago by Ponce de Leon. Drive a few miles beyond greater Orlando and you soon find yourself on two-lane country roads where livestock graze placidly on ranch land. In fact, downtown Kissimmee could be right at home in Montana.\nMore coverage All signs point to Cincinnati Travel new and now: Harley exhibit, park film, Airbnb Africa A family, wooed by down-covered beds, converts to 'glamping' Late 19th- and early 20th-century buildings, along with Florida's oldest courthouse, line the streets. Shops and restaurants are local - there's nary a chain store in sight.\nReminders of the cattle business are everywhere. The sidewalks are embedded with designs of horseshoes and bucking broncos, and the hardware store, Makinson, doubles as a tack shop. It dates from 1884 and sports a large painted sign of a horse on its facade. Patrons' attire is total cowboy - jeans, boots, hats. In this neck of the woods, these are work clothes, not a fashion statement.\nFor a deeper understanding of the rich history of Kissimmee, visit the Osceola County Welcome Center on the outskirts of town along Route 192, the road that heads right into the Disney parks. Part tourist information office and part museum, the center is filled with lifelike exhibits that illuminate Kissimmee's pioneer and ranching past.\nWe learned that a Philadelphian was indirectly responsible for Florida's cattle industry. Just after the Civil War, entrepreneur Hamilton Disston migrated south from the City of Brotherly Love to dredge a canal from Lake Tohopekaliga at Kissimmee's edge down to the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting \"river highway\" also drained the swamp, creating more than four million acres ideal for grazing.\nSoon, the region was filled with \"crackers,\" a term that descends from Florida cowboys. Small strips of deer hide attached to the end of a cow herder's whip caused a loud \"crack\" when snapped, a useful sound when rounding up cattle.\nThe ranching heritage is evident on the eastern edge of town, where a rodeo ground occupies pride of place amid Kissimmee's recreational facilities. The Silver Spurs Arena is home to the oldest rodeo east of the Mississippi. Our visit coincided with the Ram National Circuit Finals Rodeo, a national championship competition that attracts high-caliber buckin' broncs from all over the country, including finalists from Osceola County. Scuffed and dusty boots adorned with jangling spurs on many of the attendees convinced us this was no Wild West Show. We were seeing the real deal. Ticket prices were a fraction of the admission fee at one of the theme parks, making this an affordable and family-friendly alternative.\nThose seeking a bit of nature and quiet can find it at Shingle Creek Regional Park, an oasis of green in an otherwise commercial strip. In addition to offering hiking, paddling and wildlife, the park is home to Pioneer Village, a living-history museum tucked off a country road just a mile behind the visitor center. Historic buildings salvaged from throughout Florida make up a late 19th-century town on a site where settlers first lived. These include the 1889 Lanier home, from one of Kissimmee's prominent ranching families, as well as the Cadman citrus warehouse, believed to be the oldest surviving example related to the state's foremost crop.\nHistory - of a prehistoric kind - was very much on our minds a few hours later during our kayaking encounter with the alligator farther down Shingle Creek. Rich Miller, proprietor of the Paddling Center, had assured us alligators are naturally shy creatures. According to Rich, \"They're more afraid of you than you are of them.\" We doubted that very much.\nWe questioned that advice even more as we glided by the bank not 30 feet from where that 10-footer was sunning herself, one eye gazing along the creek. On our way back, the alligator was no longer visible. Which got us thinking: Which is scarier, an alligator you see, or one you don't?\nWe had sought authentic Florida and found it, even if at that moment it was scurrying along the creek bed below us, and, we hoped, more afraid of us than we were of her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T10:49:51.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
