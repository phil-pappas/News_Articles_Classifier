Already a record number of buyers have committed to attending NAC 2016.\n“Due to the number of buyers expected and the collaboration with Brand USA, we expect to attract golf resorts, golf courses, hotels, regional CVBs (Convention & Visitor Bureaus) and state tourist boards from across the USA in addition to golf tourism suppliers from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America.\n“NAC will also coincide with the publication of the results of our ground-breaking USA golf tourism survey being conducted with America’s destination-marketing organization, Brand USA.”\nGuillaume Post, Manager of IAGTO’s Brand USA project, said: “While we are focusing on 30 US ‘golf destination’ states, with NAC at Pinehurst next year, we are keen to develop a complete picture of golf tourism in the state of North Carolina. Already, Visit North Carolina (the state’s tourist board) has registered for our national golf tourism survey along with nine out of the 12 regional golf destination CVBs. Two weeks into the survey, we already have the participation of six States and 40 regional CVBs. Our ongoing US survey and preparations for NAC 2016 will run in parallel over the coming 10 months.”\nClaudio DeMarchi, IAGTO’s North America Representative, is certain that Pinehurst will be a major draw for golf tourism suppliers from across the continent. He said: “The business conducted at NAC is what attracts buyers and suppliers to the event, but commercially-orientated golf facilities will also benefit from being able to experience first-hand how Pinehurst Resort works, so it will be successful on both the domestic and international stages. All US tourist boards targeting domestic or international golf travel should also consider either attending or supporting their industry partners to attend.”\nThe US Open will return to Pinehurst in 2024, marking the fourth time this national championship has been played on Pinehurst No. 2. It is the only course in more than 100 years to have hosted four US Opens within a 25-year span and staged both the men’s and women’s US Opens in 2014.\nPinehurst was voted North America Golf Resort of the Year by tour operators in the 2015 IAGTO Awards and 2016 will mark the 10th anniversary of Pinehurst’s designation as a National Historic Landmark by the US Department of the Interior.\nAccording to Ben Crenshaw, there are two places in the world that every golfer should visit: St. Andrews and Pinehurst. “A golfer is not complete until he’s been to both,” said Crenshaw, co-architect with Bill Coore in the 2010-11 restoration of Pinehurst No. 2.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:44:31.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
