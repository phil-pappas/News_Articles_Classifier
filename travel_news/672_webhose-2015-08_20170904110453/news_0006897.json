Billed as offering a “new look, new experience”, its redevelopment under the direction of golf course architect, Paul Jansen, came 22 years after the course was first opened.\nAfter attending the launch event, European Tour and Asian Tour player, Shiv Kapur, described it as “an exceptional golf course that maintains traditions of the game. You walk off with a smile on your face”, he said.\nThe second leg of the Laguna Classic will be played at Laguna Phuket’s sister course, Laguna Lang Co in Central Vietnam from November 12-14. This tournament will feature brand ambassador for the Banyan Tree-owned and operated resort, six-times Majors winner, Sir Nick Faldo, who designed the course and opened it in March 2013.\nPackages to play both tournament venues are available from USD1200 for members and USD1500 for non-members, including golf with caddie and shared cart, on-site accommodation at Angsana hotels, transfers, welcome party and presentation dinners at both venues.\nThe overall winner will receive hotel, golf and spa entitlements with the Banyan Tree Group valued at more than USD15,000.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:30:31.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
