Wow, just wow. Picture: Ren Juo Source: Flickr \nFROM lush, thick jungle to dramatic mountain ranges and glistening white sand beaches, the Philippines is home to more than 7000 idyllic islands, waiting to be explored. \nBut how does one choose their little slice of paradise? We’ve picked nine of our favourite islands in the Philippines so you don’t have to. \n1. Kick back on the powder white sand of Boracay \nThis once secluded island has quickly become a tourist hotspot. Aptly named White Beach, there’s a mix of accommodation options — from budget-friendly bungalows to luxe 5-star resorts. \nAnd don’t forget Willy’s Rock. Willy's rock at Boracay.

Hunt for lost treasure in the caves of Caramoan \nWander between incredible stalactite formations at Caramoan National Park before heading to Manipis Cave — believed to be the hiding place of General Yamashita’s treasure. \n3. Kayak through the limestone formations at El Nido, Palawan \nJoining the likes of Ha Long Bay in Vietnam and Krabi in Thailand, the lesser-known Bacuit Archipelago is perhaps even more breathtaking — 45 limestone karst cliffs punctuated with secluded lagoons and coves.

This challenging right hand break is not for the faint-hearted. \n5. Take in 360-degree views of the Chocolate Hills, Bohol \nMore than 1000 grass-covered hills shaped like Hershey’s kisses cover land as far as the eye can see. It makes for an extraordinary photograph, to say the least. Chocolate Hills is impressive. Source: Getty Images \n6. Befriend wild sea turtles at Apo Reef, Mindoro \nThis stunning spot is an absolute diver’s paradise. You’ll feel like you’ve stepped — or, swum — back a few millennia when you find yourself alongside the ancient, and ever-beautiful, sea turtles. \n7. Dive through Japanese ship wrecks at Coron Bay \nDivers head here to see the WWII Japanese supply fleet that were sunk during the US air strike in September 1944. The vessels remain some of the best dive sites in the Philippines. Diving at Coron Bay. Picture: David Spencer Source: Flickr \n8. Escape to the Ardent Hot Springs, Camiguin Island \nThere are few things more invigorating than a dip in hot springs, and after an adventure-packed holiday through the Philippines, recharging in this world-famous spot is a must. \n9. Trek through the rolling hills of Batanes \nYou won’t be the first to draw comparisons between the sprawling scenery of Batanes and New Zealand’s sweeping views. With canyons, cliffs, unique geological formations and endless views of the sea, you’ll find yourself falling in love everywhere you look. Batanes.
