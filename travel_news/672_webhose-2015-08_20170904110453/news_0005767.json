The flight could only take off when one could be sourced from another plane.\n'It is a legal requirement, under air navigation orders, to have ashtrays because while smoking is not permitted on flights, if someone were to light a cigarette on board there must be somewhere to safely extinguish it,' a BA spokesperson told MailOnline at the time.\n'We apologise to customers for the inconvenience but their safety is always our overriding priority.'\nA BA flight was grounded for not having an ashtray in the toilets in 2009\nThe ashtray rule may seem pedantic but it was born from tragedy. In 1973, 123 people died when a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris had to make an emergency landing due to smoke in the cabin.\nThe smoke is thought to have been caused by a lit cigarette being thrown into a lavatory waste paper basket. Many passengers on the flight died of smoke inhalation before the impact of the crash.\nThe US' Code of Federal Regulation states: 'Regardless of whether smoking is allowed in any other part of the airplane, lavatories must have self-contained, removable ashtrays located conspicuously on or near the entry side of each lavatory door...'\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency has similar guidelines in place, with one ashtray on the inside of each aircraft toilet fitted by law.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1WB6SBl"], "published": "2015-08-18T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:33:14.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
