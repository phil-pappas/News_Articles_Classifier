The first, which showed him receiving packages while on duty in Uganda, became an instant hit - thanks in large part to the radiant smile that lights up his face. Since then, every picture uploaded by StrayBullet has featured his charismatic beam, earning the young Marine a legion of online fans - the vast majority of whom are female. They appear to grasp the humor pretty quick, because they kept laughing while loading me down with weapons telling me the photo needs &quot;more guns&quot; in it. Imgurians! I sincerely apologize for not providing more guns in this photo, as you requested on the last photo. Hopefully you will accept this photo of me riding the barrel of a tank while holding two PKM&#039;s as sufficient evidence that I will do my best in the future. I want to be that OP that delivers to you the images you request. In the meantime, be good, be safe, and make efforts to spread smiles. (Photo credit goes to &quot;HelmetFire&quot; A.K.A. The Unfortunate Black Marine). That&#039;s right. RHM is hitting stateside. Look for him in your local movie theaters, dive bars and Taco Bells.Oh, Geoff the Giraffe is coming too. WE BE HOMEWARD BOUND! Now, the Marine has even more to smile about than aid packages and a frothing online fanbase. He has fallen in love - with someone who contacted him on Imgur. In December 2013, Imgur user Wlfqueen07 decided to send the Marine a message, thanking him for his humanitarian work. StrayBullet replied back, sparking a conversation that would lead the two to realise they live only a few towns away from each other in the US. Now, two years later, the couple have revealed that the messaging didn't stop there. Wlfqueen07 yesterday posted a picture of her and StrayBullet together, along with a screenshot from their recent conversations. Ahh, ain't they just the cutest? telegraph.co.uk Follow @TelegraphMen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:22:53.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
