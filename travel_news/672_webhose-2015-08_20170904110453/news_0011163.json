Then a career in ethical hacking might be worth considering. Businesses and government organisations who take security seriously often hire ethical hackers who use the same set of tools as the criminals to protect, rather than damage, their IT networks. They’re also known as penetration testers or ‘white hat’ hackers - named after the Western movies where the good guy wore a white hat and the bad guy a black hat. With the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), a concept that describes a future where everyday physical objects like fridges and cars will be connected to the Internet, the opportunities for hacking, both ethical and criminal, have never been greater. “With 30 billion devices now connected to the internet worldwide you are opening yourself up to a much bigger attack surface,” says Neil Thacker, Information Security and Strategy Officer EMEA for security firm Websense. It’s a threat that BT Security takes particularly seriously. In April it announced the launch of BT Assure Ethical Hacking for Vehicles, a security service developed to test the exposure of connected vehicles. Increasingly vehicles are becoming susceptible to cyber attacks with 3G/4G, Bluetooth and WiFi connections used for everything from traffic information to safety monitoring and remote diagnostics. The most important thing about being an ethical hacker is that you must really, really like breaking stuff “This isn’t going away, it’s just getting bigger and bigger, and we need skilled people to deal with it,” says Carla Thomas, Head of People and Organisational Development in BT Security. Unlike some careers, ethical hacking - where some of the best are earning £100,000 a year or more - practical skills are just as important as formal qualifications. “The type of people we look for are those who have been doing this since they were very young - people who have tested the security of their own WiFi network on a regular basis,” says Carla Thomas. Adds BT’s Anoop Sethi, General Manager, Cyber Security Testing, BT Security: “You don’t necessarily need to have a degree to do this type of work, it’s about a passion. We had one guy who had installed a boiler over Christmas and dismantled it in his spare time to see how it interfaced with the Internet of Things.” Most importantly, ethical hackers should ‘stay clean’. Engaging in illegal activity, even if it doesn’t lead to a conviction, is likely to kill your ethical hacking career stone dead. “Trust is a major issue,” explains BT Security’s Carla Thomas. “There are huge resources out there where you can practise hacking safely and do what you need to do in a clean environment.” BT also supports events like March’s Cyber Security Challenge Masterclass which saw 42 ‘cyber defenders’ trying to prevent a group of cyber terrorists from taking over the Royal Navy Cruiseship HMS Belfast in a simulated attack. “We hired some of the people who took part in the final event and they will become the ethical hackers of the future,” says BT’s Carla Thomas. Nor is it just big companies that are hiring ethical hackers. Even the UK’s Government Ministry of Justice has its own anonymous ‘ethical hacker’ whose job it is to find out any weaknesses in the government’s security systems before the ‘bad guys’ do. “I work with the same tools and techniques that real world attackers use to find and fix vulnerabilities in our systems before they are released,” writes the anonymous hacker in a Ministry of Justice blog. Asked what it’s like to be an ethical hacker he says: “The most important thing is that you must really, really like breaking stuff!” Doesn’t sound a like bad career choice, especially if you can earn £100,000 a year or more for doing so.
