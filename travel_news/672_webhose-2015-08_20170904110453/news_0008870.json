Should i go there a few days earlier.? I see it starts on the 19th to the 26th of Nov.? Do you think 2 weeks would be to long maybe from the 14th to the 28th.? I am on a budget so could you recommend any good budget accommodation please. Location is important walking is good, clean is good, basic is good, safe is good. I am a single senior gentleman. I would appreciate any help i can get regarding my request. Thank you all in advance. Shanti Russel I suggest you read the calendar of events here . It looks to me like max camel is 17 Nov. When you go depends on what you want to see. We wanted camel immersion, so went for five days centered on the maximum number of camels. If races or fairs or other such interest you more, then of course go on those days. Walt Whitman - Song of Myself Do I contradict myself?
