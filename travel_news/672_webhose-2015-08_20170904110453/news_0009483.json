This is the living laboratory that is the Galapagos Islands.\nThere are a few places on the planet where it is a real privilege to witness first hand. This is one of those places.\nStraddling the Equator in the Pacific Ocean around 1000km due west off the coast of mainland Ecuador, the Galapagos archipelago is best known as the place naturalist Charles Darwin developed his theory of natural selection. It was the small finches of these remote islands and the adaptation of their beak shapes to various environmental pressures that helped to inspire his groundbreaking work on evolution, The Origin Of Species.\nYou can see why these islands were such an inspiration. It truly is nature’s construction site. Our seven-night cruise on a 16-passenger boat called the Beluga began with a visit to the highlands of Santa Cruz Island and some of the archipelago’s best known inhabitants, the giant tortoises. We were lucky to have many David Attenborough-style moments with these grand living treasures, some of them more than 100 years old. They can weigh up to 250kg and the oldest on record lived to be 152.\nAs with all of the wildlife on the Galapagos there is a “2m rule”. Get no closer, unless they come up to you, or you have to step over a sleeping sea lion at the pier. In Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz’s largest town, we had to do just that after we visited the Charles Darwin Research Station, where there’s a successful tortoise breeding program.\nA giant Galapagos tortoise.

It’s an almost out-of-this-world experience that will leave you gobsmacked every time you get in the water. The Devil’s Crown was a highlight. This old volcanic cone’s jagged remnants rise out of the ocean and sea lions, sharks, sea turtles and countless species of fish abound in the surrounding waters. Our itinerary took us to several of the islands, including some stunning locations on the largest of the islands, Isabela. In some places you get in the water, in other places, you walk along tracks to view volcanoes, calderas, lava fields and craggy coastlines.\nOne of the best views is on Bartolome Island, where on the way, you walk through a red, almost Martian-like volcanic landscape.\nThe volcanic vista on Bartolome Island. Picture: Louise Browne Source: Supplied\nIn some of the lava fields there are tidal ponds that are also home to amazing pink flamingos. At another spot there’s a beach where visitors can shuffle into the water carefully and inquisitive stingrays come right up to suck on your toes. Marine iguanas in their thousands congregate on rocky shorelines — each with a different facial expression — and you can watch them feeding under water as you snorkel. Land iguanas can be spotted out of their burrows lazing in scrubland.\nLagoons abound with flocks of golden rays, spotted rays and sea lions sleeping in trees. And while cruising between islands, jumping manta rays create flashes of silver in the distance.\nThe awesome birdlife includes everything from the Galapagos penguins, frigate birds (the males are known for inflating their bright-red throat pouches), gorgeous blue-footed boobies and flightless cormorants that have evolved just to swim.\nThe stunning blue-footed booby. Picture: Louise Browne Source: Supplied\nWhen we crossed the Equator we celebrated by sipping cocktails with the captain and for a short time the sun was setting on one side of the boat and a full moon rose on the other. Magic. Our group was fortunate enough to have had a local guide whose vast knowledge of marine biology, geology and vulcanology brought incredible insight into the wonder and fragility of his homeland. Darwin (and yes, he was named after the great man) has witnessed many changes to these precious islands with the increased influx of tourists and recent climate fluctuations.\nGalapagos is a bucket-list, dream destination and it’s jaw-droppingly beautiful, but it is under threat, not only from changing weather patterns but from tourism growing at an unsustainable rate. The battle is now on to find ways to make it work so that this paradise doesn’t become collateral damage in Ecuador’s effort to develop its unique asset. So tread lightly, take it all in. A trip to the Galapagos can be life changing.\nLagoons abound with flocks of golden rays, spotted rays and sea lions sleeping in trees.

You get personal service and attention from the crew and the guide is able to be flexible with the itinerary if conditions change. Part of your travel price goes towards entrance to the Galapagos National Park and for conservation work. If you’re not used to snorkelling, get some practice in before you go and consider buying an underwater camera. The people of Ecuador are warm and welcoming and love it if you try to speak Spanish. Since 2000, the currency in Ecuador has been US dollars. The journey to Galapagos usually begins in Ecuador’s capital, Quito, which sits in a narrow valley in the Andes at around 3000m. If there’s time, have a couple of extra days there and take a city or market tour (Intrepid Urban Adventures) and a ride in the Teleferico cable car which takes you up to almost 4000m and stunning views.\nGETTING THERE\nThere are many ways to fly to Ecuador and yes, they all take a long time. I travelled on United Airlines via Los Angeles and Houston and then to Quito (about 25 hours flying time from Melbourne plus stopovers) or, you can choose other airlines that travel via Auckland, Santiago, Lima and on to Quito, or even travel via Miami or Mexico City. From Quito it takes over two hours to fly directly to the Galapagos or longer if you have a fuel stop in the coastal city of Guayaquil.\nLouise Browne travelled to Ecuador at her own expense.\nOriginally published as Living laboratory the origin of spectacular", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/30/1227463/418103-9ba722b8-2c24-11e5-97c4-6277ec483809.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/30/1227463/448752-9cdeee68-2c24-11e5-97c4-6277ec483809.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/07/30/1227463/418131-97124944-2c24-11e5-97c4-6277ec483809.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/visit-the-galapagos-islands-but-tread-lightly-on-natures-construction-site/story-fnglekhp-1227463418157", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/07/30/1227463/417612-97f22c26-2c24-11e5-97c4-6277ec483809.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-30T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:57:55.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
