If voters approve the plan in November, a 4.5 percent tax would be added to lift tickets at Breckenridge, which would raise at least $3.5 million for transit improvements. The tax would add about $6 to a Breckenridge lift ticket. The Denver Post reported the compromise was reached after the tax plan excluded taxes on Vail's Epic Pass, which also includes skiing at Vail Resorts' (NYSE: MTN) other Colorado resorts. “In the spirit of compromise, the council felt this amount would be adequate to begin to work on the much needed improvements for this vital issue for our community,” said Breckenridge Mayor John Warner , in a statement.
