The House of Marley Smile Jamaica Earth-Friendly Headphones feature a smart-looking wood covering on the ear bud itself crafted from FSC-certified (Forest Stewardship Council) wood. \nOn the front of the earbud, the casing is crafted from recycled aluminum. While that may sound less than comfortable, the earpiece fits snugly and softly in the ear and is pleasant to wear even for several hours at a time. \nThe best part is that the thick fabric cord is basically tangle free since it is not one of those wiry, plastic cords that can easily become a ball of knots when tucked away in your bag. \nI am a huge fan of in-ear headphones because they can fit in your pocket when not in use and take up virtually no room in your carry-on bag. To be honest, I never find that expensive Bose headphones really cancel out much noise. They seem to muffle sound, but I can still hear noises from a baby crying or that irritating newspaper reader on every 6am flight. \nBack to the sound quality, it is extremely well-balanced with low and high notes perfectly paired. Often times, cheap headphones have that type of balance thrown off. The have a one-button remote system and come in nearly a dozen different color options including variations in the earbud and chord. \nThe headphones offer exceptional quality for the price and are both durable and lightweight making them the perfect gift for the frequent traveler. They come with a small carrying case. They are available from the House of Marley website, at Best Buy , or on Amazon for around $20. And if you forgot to pack yours before getting to the airport, they are now available at airport Hudson News stores across the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T10:47:59.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
