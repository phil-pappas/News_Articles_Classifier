Razak, she chose to create this boutique hotel for tourists who want to taste a different atmosphere and experience a kampung life-style in an urban area. \n“Although the standard of a boutique hotel must not exceed 100 rooms and is of a smaller size than the usual hotel, the theme is expressed through the décor and service from the staff which has always been a ‘wow factor’ to visitors who come to stay,” she told Bernama. \nIntan said the concept presented by each boutique hotel is in accordance with their respective specialties but the main objective of boutique hotels remain the same, that is to offer a new experience for the tourists. \nOf significant interest to this Bernama journalist during a visit to the hotel was the attractive view of KLCC from several rooms although the rooms’ decor featured that of a wooden house. \nAnggun Boutique Hotel is located in the Bukit Bintang area of Kuala Lumpur. — Picture via AnggunKL.com Meanwhile, the Anggun Boutique Hotel located in Bukit Bintang here highlights the ‘Baba Nyonya’ architectural features and decoration concept. \nThe hotel’s entrance gate carved with patterns of ‘Dynasty’ will certainly catch the attention of anyone who comes across the hotel, located in Jalan Tong Shin Tengkat. \nAccording to its marketing officer, Dian Anggraani, the uniqueness of boutique hotels with chic modernistic architectural designs highlighting the native culture draws tourists like a magnet. \nShe said many foreign tourists prefer to stay in boutique hotels due to the unique experience it gives them. \nHowever, she said it is not so popular with local tourists. \n“Some people think that staying in a big hotel or a taller building is more comfortable than staying in a boutique hotel which is much smaller. \n“People need to know that boutique hotels can also provide quality services on par with other hotel facilities such as Internet service and the hotel’s strategic location, especially for tourists exploring the capital,” she said. — Bernama More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:54:02.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
