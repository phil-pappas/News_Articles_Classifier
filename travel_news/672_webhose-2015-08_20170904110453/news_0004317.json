Photographer's Note \nSince the Hermitage in St. Petersburg was once the residence of the tsars, one expects there to be a throne room. The hermitage has two throne rooms, the large and the small. The small room is the first one visited, and the tsar himself usually was not seen there, but instead some other high-ranking official. If the visitor was then deemed worthy, he/she would be escorted to the large throne room to meet with the tsar. This is the throne in the small throne room. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:05:37.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
