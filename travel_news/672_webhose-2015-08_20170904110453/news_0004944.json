Not only does it offer rates starting at just $108 for the dates we looked at, but it has an outdoor pool, added shuttle service to Universal Orlando, and one nice value that can be rare around here: there's no daily resort fee. \nJW Marriott Orlando Grande Lakes \nIf you want a little more of a splurge, JW Marriott Orlando Grande Lakes has a huge enticement for non-theme park downtime: a 24,000-square-foot water park, along with free shuttles to Disney World, SeaWorld and Universal Orlando (rates for our dates started at $220). \nUniversal Orlando, Orlando, FL Doubletree Orlando \nDoubletree Orlando (Courtesy Double Tree) \nThe Doubletree Orlando wins the prize for being closest to the park entrance--less than three quarters of a mile--but you also have access to the free shuttle and, since it's a Universal Orlando Partner, some theme park discounts. The hotel has an outdoor pool, an arcade and the undeniable draw of those signature chocolate chip cookies at check-in (rates start at $99). \nWestgate Palace \nFor a longer walk but suite-style accommodations, stay at the Westgate Palace (starting at $134 for our dates), which has fully equipped kitchens, in-room washers and dryers, and free shuttle service to Universal and the other big parks (and it's also a short walk from Wet 'N Wild Orlando ). \nHershey Park, Hershey, PA Days Inn Hershey \nThe closest hotel to the chocolate mecca--aside from the luxe Hotel Hershey and Hershey Lodge --is the Days Inn, which offers the perks of a free shuttle to the park, a free breakfast and an indoor pool (rates on the dates we checked started at $119). \nInn at Westwynd Farm \nThe Inn at Westwynd Farm (Courtesy The Inn at Westwynd Farm) \nIf you want a more of local-flavor place to stay and don't mind a short drive (about 3 miles), check out The Inn at Westwynd Farm, a 32-acre horse farm that also has resident alpacas, a waterfall and discount tickets for Hersheypark (rates for a family of three start at $139). \nCedar Point, Sandusky, OH Castaway Bay \nWaterpark at Castaway Bay (Courtesy Castaway Bay) \nWhile it's officially affiliated with the roller-coaster-centric theme park , Castaway Bay, at first glance, has one disadvantage compared to the main hotel, the beachfront Hotel Breakers : Castaway Bay is two miles, rather than a two-minute walk, from the theme park. But no matter: Castaway Bay has a 38,000-square-foot indoor water park (including a thrilling water coaster), a 6,000-square-foot arcade, meet-and-greets with Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, and perks like early entrance to Cedar Point and discounted tickets. Room rates for a family of four typically start at $159, and include water-park admission (which, at $30 per person otherwise, makes staying overnight a serious deal).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:04:58.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
