Below are a few highlights of the route, best enjoyed by bicycle. \nChateauneuf-en-Auxois \nTowards the southern end of the cruise route, less than a kilometre from the canal, lies the picturesque town of Chateuneuf. Reachable by just a short trip up a gentle hill, Chateuneuf commands attractive views of the countryside and canal. Complete with historic houses and a chateau dating back to the 12th century, the historic, calm, yet invigorating atmosphere of Chateauneuf is very much in keeping with the laid-back spirit of a barge cruise holiday. \nShould you wish to go further, a little less than two kilometres north of the town is the Panthier reservoir. Mirror-smooth and often bathed in clear mountain sunlight, it’s well worth visiting for a swim and perhaps lunch at the nearby hotel restaurant. It’s then only a short downhill cycle back to the canal and the comfort of your boat. \nMorvan Forest \nA few kilometres further north, the canal draws very close to a national park. Disembarking at Villeneuve-sous-Charigny, a four-kilometre ride will bring you to the eastern edge of Morvan Forest. Depending on your pace (do ensure you have a good handle on how quickly you can cycle and for how long before going too far from the boat), you’ll be able to enjoy the forest’s softly rolling hills and idyllic fields. \nPerhaps one for a more experienced cyclist, a medium-length 15km route can see you skim the outer edge of the park, whereas a slightly longer 25km route might have you follow the banks of the Serein for a little while before returning to the vessel. These routes are highly recommended if you prefer a little more activity. \nTonnerre \nThe northern end of the canal passes through the town of Tonnerre. Larger than Chateauneuf, it’s nonetheless very much worth a visit, and requires no additional travel to reach. Dotted with tree-lined boulevards, narrow alleys and ups and downs to keep the ride interesting, Tonnerre features a handful of restaurants and shops along its main road. It’s also worth cycling out to the tucked away Le Saint Père for a drink. The town’s pleasant river crossings and houses make for a slightly more urban environment without breaking the remote feel of a barge cruise holiday. \nWherever you want! \nDon’t forget that these are just suggestions: the best part of taking a bicycle on a barge cruise holiday (and some may even include them on board) is being able to get off and explore wherever you’d like. Remember to always ensure you can find your way back to the boat and know your limits with regards to speed and stamina, and you’ll have fun exploring both land and water on your barge cruise holiday.
