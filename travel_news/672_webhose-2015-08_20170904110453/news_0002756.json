There were the Big Boys – Barossa shiraz and Coonawarra cabernet from South Australia, Hunter Valley semillon from New South Wales, and Margaret River cabernet sauvignon from Western Australia – and a general national preference for ripe, juicy, wham-bam richness. My, how things are changing. In the Barossa Valley, particularly, a new generation of “natural\" wine-makers, untrammelled by tradition, are shaking things up by working in an artisanal, small-scale fashion, choosing sustainable, organic or biodynamic practices to reflect the “terroir”, or sense of place. Australian wines are fast becoming more nuanced, natural, ethical, food-friendly – and showing almost as much diversity as Australian food itself. In picturesque north-east Victoria, Italian grapes such as barbera and nebbiolo are being crafted into elegant, structured wines with a genuine sense of place. Then there are the unique sauvignon blanc/semillon blends of the Margaret River in Western Australia; the bright, fresh sangioveses of Mudgee in New South Wales; and the crisp beautifully balanced chardonnays of Victoria’s Mornington and Bellarine Peninsulas. Taste the mix of cooking influences Australia’s migrants have brought to the table To complement the nation’s fine wines, a new breed of vineyard hospitality goes way beyond cellar doors and picnic grounds. At the historic All Saints in north-east Victoria, for example, the modern bistro fare of chef Simon Arkless stands out as one of the state’s best vineyard dining options. You can taste your birth year in vintage tawny port at Seppeltsfield in the Barossa Valley; or learn fly-fishing on the lake at Joseph Chromy in Tasmania. Or find out for yourself why the Aussies embrace their wine industry so fondly by taking a tour of a wine region. Along the way, you’ll discover the people, landscape, traditions and lifestyle behind one of the world’s greatest wine nations. Join them for a glass or two in their cellar or over a meal in one of the world-class restaurants, wine bars or cafes. Taste the mix of cooking influences Australia’s migrants have brought to the table in simple snacks or in a fine dinner where you’ll be treated to a 16-course degustation menu with matching wines. And, when the day is done, you can raise a glass to the well-matched joys of fine Australian wine and food.
