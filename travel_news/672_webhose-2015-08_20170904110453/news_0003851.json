James Martin \nOn a 2010 trip to Turkey we were surprised to find ourselves directed towards a very long line upon arrival at Istanbul's airport from our Turkish Air flight. It appeared travelers of various nationalities were being charged for entering the country, and they had not read about it. Not everyone paid the same price. No one seemed to be prepared. It was bedlam. Angry bedlam. \nSo, yes, if you are American, you will have to pay for a visa (tourist tax) to enter the country of Turkey. Here's the official pronouncement from the US Embassy in Ankara: \n\"American citizens traveling to Turkey on U.S. passports must obtain a visa. Currently, holders of all types of passports can purchase a 90-day sticker visa at the port of entry for $20 cash if they are traveling to Turkey as tourists.\" \n\" Effective February 1, 2012 , the Turkish authorities will implement new regulations allowing a maximum stay of 90 days within a 180 day period . The new regulation will not make any changes to the visa requirements for travel to Turkey but it will affect how long U.S. Citizens can remain in Turkey. The new regulation affects all foreigners who travel to Turkey. This new regulation will apply all, whether they travel with a tourist visa obtained at a Turkish Consulate or buy a tourist visa stamp at an airport or other port of entry or are exempt from getting tourist visas. \" ~ Turkish Visa Requirements (Emphasis theirs) \nOk, so now you're set for a long delay getting this visa, smashed together with people who've spent an inordinate time being smashed together on an airplane. The chances they will be upbeat are the same as the chances they will smell good. You might have to figure out things out in front of an electronic kiosk at the airport, like everybody else. \nBut here's the smashingly fantastic part. You don't have to do that. You can now get your visa online. \nJust head to e-Visa - Republic of Turkey and follow the instructions. It's an easy process, and far better than standing in line waiting at the airport after a 14 hour flight. A Word About Your Passport for Visitors to Turkey \nTurkey has slightly different requirements for the passport expiration date than other European countries. Here is the requirement as of time of writing from the US Passports page . \n\"You need a passport and visa to travel to Turkey. As of January 1, 2015 foreigners wishing to enter Turkey must carry a passport or travel document with an expiration date at least 60 days beyond the expiration date of their visa, visa exemption, or residence permit. Therefore, as Turkish tourist visas are generally valid for 6 months, U.S. citizens should have a passport that is valid for eight months beyond entry date. Passports should have enough blank space to allow for Turkish entry and exit stamps. If there is not enough space for entry and exit stamps in your passport, you will be denied entry into Turkey. There is one exception to the visa requirement: U.S. citizens who are traveling to Turkey by cruise ship are allowed to enter Turkey without a visa for a maximum period of 72 hours, with permission given by the local security authorities at the port of entry.\" \nAnd finally, you should be aware of the advice given on the Passports page: \n\"The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S citizens not to overstay their visas and to maintain valid residence permits at all times. Turkish authorities do enforce the laws, by imposing fines, deporting violators, and banning future travel to Turkey for people who overstay their visas or do not maintain valid residence permits.\" Our Expert Recommends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T05:47:03.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
