For the last few years, he’s been playing a young man’s game — his brand of country music is dynamic, attitudinal, a little goofy. There are flickers of hip-hop in his phrasing; at his shows, he struts atop a tricked-out pickup truck. His most successful single is called “Country Girl (Shake It for Me).”\nEvery spring break for the last seven years, Bryan has played a show for hundreds of thousands of swimsuit-clad partyers — the revelry has become part of his brand. He even releases theme music for the occasion: “Spring Break … Checkin’ Out,” the most recent of those EPs, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard country album chart in March.\nBut this year, Bryan announced that he wouldn’t be beach rave entertainment any longer. His March performance in Panama City, Fla., would be his last of the kind. It was time to grow up.\nWhat a drag.\nMost Read Stories Chelan blazes: With no end in sight, thousands evacuate Percy Harvin doubles down on comments about his Seahawks tenure Reactions mixed to NYT story about Amazon’s work conditions Jeff Bezos says Amazon won’t tolerate ‘callous’ management practices Inside Amazon: wrestling big ideas in a bruising workplace “Kill the Lights” (Capitol Nashville), Bryan’s fifth studio album, is his most mature, and almost studiously un-fun. It’s the sort of flattening that’s happened to Alan Jackson and Brad Paisley, to Tim McGraw and Blake Shelton (but not to Keith Urban, who was adult-contemporary before he became a real adult): Bryan is trading in his youthful vim for something more measured.\nHere, the transition is literal: The first two songs are familiar Bryan turf. “Kick the Dust Up” is a rural party anthem — “We go way out where there ain’t nobody/We turn this cornfield into a party” — with Bryan’s voice sweetened just a bit with Auto-tune. That’s followed by the title track, a gleaming chunk of disco-country that’s almost sensuous (though not quite).\nThen Bryan hits the brakes. Apart from “Move,” a Montgomery Gentry-esque song about feral attraction (“You got me where you want me, where I wanna be/all up in the middle of your left and right”), the rest of this album finds Bryan mellow, or trying to be.\nHearing Bryan sing in slo-mo often exposes cracks in the facade that his more up-tempo songs mask. Here, the wordy, contemplative “To the Moon and Back” gets the best of him — Bryan is a mover and a feeler, not a thinker. And “Home Alone Tonight,” a song about drowning breakup sorrows in a shot glass and in another person, isn’t particularly sexy or particularly tortured. There’s no lust in his voice, no sense of desperation.\nHe can be tender, though, as he is on “Fast” and the maudlin slow jam “Strip It Down.” When that tenderness turns to wistfulness, Bryan is at home, as on “Just Over,” where he’s nursing a breakup, his voice shivering, and on the album’s closing ballad, “Scarecrows,” an outstanding paean to rowdy rural teenage living (“Just some ol’ plowboys pretending we’re cowboys”) that is among Bryan’s best songs.\nHe recently played a relatively tiny (by his standards) corporate-sponsored show at Irving Plaza in New York; his last two concerts in the city were at Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center. It seemed an ideal opportunity to turn down his arena volume and showcase his more intimate side. But even before he took the stage, the speakers were booming a dubstep remix of a Flo Rida song. Someone was tossing glow sticks into the crowd. Bryan’s party was raging unimpeded.\nHe opened with “Kick the Dust Up,” and before the song was over, had already turned his ball cap to the back. From there, he tried a string of ballads, old and new, but the crowd lit back up when he played “Kill the Lights.” Then he introduced “Move” as “my next ‘Country Girl (Shake It for Me).’ The girls like it, but the boys really like it.” Later, he turned “I Don’t Want This Night to End” into his familiar mashup of Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” and Taio Cruz’s “Dynamite.”\nThis is a stylistic approach that he helped introduce to country, yet its success is now measured in how far other, younger acts, from Florida Georgia Line to Sam Hunt, are able to push the boundaries. Don’t count Bryan totally out, though. During the encore, he played “That’s My Kind of Night” and “Country Girl (Shake It for Me).” For just a few seconds in each one, he hit that slow gyration of the hips that he’s known for, and he looked like a man at peace.\nJON CARAMANICA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:24:14.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
