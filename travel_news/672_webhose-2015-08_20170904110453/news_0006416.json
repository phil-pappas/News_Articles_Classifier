The Sathorn Unique Tower, being the tallest abandonment in the world makes it even more remarkable,\" says Lau.\nHearing Lau retell the details of his urbex -- urban exploring -- is sometimes vertigo-inducing enough, without seeing the photos.\nParticularly when tells how his team walked a bridge to access the the Sathorn tower.\n\"The metal was so rusty, making it so thin, we had to be super cautious when walking,\" he says.\n\"We were walking floor by floor,\" says Lau. \"The special thing about urbex is that there could be something interesting on any floor, around any corner. After climbing 49 floors, we reached the top and waited for the sunrise.\"\nMORE: Russian climbers move from pyramids to Shanghai in bid to scale new heights\n'Know your limits'\nExploring the tallest abandoned building in the world - Sathorn Unique Tower (also known as the Ghost Tower, as a man was found hung inside) #Exthetics @NewEraHK @RedBullHK Full video: https://youtu.be/zLD4Z0YlPs4\nA video posted by #Exthetics (@daniel__lau) on Aug 14, 2015 at 8:50am PDT\nRooftoppers have made regular headlines in recent years, often creating controversy with their daredevil activities.\nTwo Russian climbers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, had to apologize in 2013 after climbing the Great Pyramid at Giza , Egypt.\nThere's also been tragedy.\nEarlier in 2015 a 21-year-old French tourist fell and died during what the police believed to be a climb that went badly wrong .\nFor Lau, it's all about trying to push his limits, and he doesn't encourage others to try.\n\"Let's put it this way, personally I'm scared of ghosts, I could never understand why people would explore haunted places.\"\n\"Know your limits, never try to use this as a way to show off,\" he says. \"I've never been scared of heights -- height was not a problem for me to overcome. Being a daredevil was not a character that I wished to establish either.\"\nHe adds: \"I have pretty good balancing ability, no one could feel how I feel being on that exact position.\n\"Always evaluate yourself when you're climbing. Even going back to the same rooftop, having different energy levels or an empty stomach could make a big difference.\n\"Anything involves risks, but you're the one who should take responsibility of yourself.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.yangtse.com/nanjing/2015-07-29/594410.html", "https://instagram.com/daniel__lau/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2FRDaRX3DQ", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXSZNxeHGYA", "https://youtu.be/zLD4Z0YlPs4", "http://www.exthetics.co/", "https://instagram.com/p/6XpQawosVK/", "https://instagram.com/d_sights/", "http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/french-tourist-pierre-boutauts-crane-fall-death-utterly-devastating-20150701-gi2bbz.html", "https://instagram.com/lawrencedehk/"], "published": "2015-08-18T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T05:44:44.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
