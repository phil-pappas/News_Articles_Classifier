The new all-inclusive offers see agents able to see cruises with up to $2,700 benefits as part of the price such as free drinks, free on-board spend and even free wifi. \nAgents will earn double points for booking inside or ocean view staterooms; triple points for Balcony or Concierge staterooms and - for the first time - quadruple points for Aquaclass or above accommodation categories on sailings to Europe during summer 2016. Itineraries applicable for the offer departing throughout summer 2016 include an 11-night Greece, Turkey and Italy fly/cruise; a ten-night Western Mediterranean fly/cruise; a ten-night Italy and Croatia fly/cruise and a 14-night Scandinavia and Russia cruise-only holiday. The double, triple and quadruple points offers are available to book now, until 31 August 2015. An agent achieving quadruple points on an Aquaclass or suite booking could earn over 18,000 Celebrity Rewards points, enough to claim a designer watch as part of the loyalty programme.

It’s a huge opportunity to boost their Celebrity Rewards account ahead of the 2016 season and we’re sure they will enjoy watching their points accumulate and the gifts roll in.
