The delegation seized the opportunity to build up their business network and partnership with members of the travel trade from across the Mainland.\nCIBTM was co-hosted by Beijing Municipal Commission of Tourism Development and Reed Exhibitions at the China National Convention Centre in Beijing from 5 – 6 August 2015. During the exhibition, MGTO recommended its “Travel Stimulation Program” to incentive travel organizers while sharing with industry professionals and buyers about the business tourism trends and products in Macau. The event also created a range of networking and business opportunities for industry partners from Macau and across the Mainland.\nCIBTM is recognized as one of China’s largest and most well-established professional exhibitions for the meetings and incentive travel industry. Welcoming the tenth edition of CIBTM this year, the organizer held functions in celebration. MGTO was invited to the appreciation luncheon and welcome dinner for exhibitors under the theme “CIBTM – Celebrating 10 Years”. During the banquet, MGTO was awarded the accolade “Most Multi Culture MICE Destination” in recognition of its remarkable efforts in promoting Macau as a business travel destination.\nSince launching the “Incentive Travel Stimulation Program” in 2012, the Tourist Office has made incessant efforts to encourage entities, enterprises and visitors from different niche markets to choose Macau as their incentive and corporate travel destination through the program. The Office also made new endeavors to keep promoting incentive travel by presenting the revamped version of “Travel Stimulation Program” on 1 July this year. In addition, MGTO actively joined the past editions of CIBTM in Beijing and leveraged this major platform to create cooperation opportunities and foster business connections between Macau and Mainland travel trade. The efforts have been made to expand the business travel market for the destination.\nThe exhibition’s main program in 2015 features professional education forums, meetings, seminars, networking functions and so on.
