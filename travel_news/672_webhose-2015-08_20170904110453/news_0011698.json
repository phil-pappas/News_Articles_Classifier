Visitors to the Appalachian Trail have been confronted with wild partygoers. Picture: John Hayes Source: Flickr \nWHEN Jackson Spencer set out to tackle the Appalachian Trail, he anticipated the solitude that only wilderness can bring — not a rolling, months-long frat party. \nShelters where he thought he could catch a good night’s sleep while listening to the sounds of nature were instead filled with trash, graffiti and people who seemed more interested in partying all night, said Spencer, who finished the entire trail last month in just 99 days. \n“I wanted the solitude. I wanted to experience nature,” he said. “I like to drink and to have a good time, but I didn’t want that to follow me there.” \nSpencer, or “Mission” as he is known to fellow thru-hikers, confronted what officials say is an ugly side effect of the increasing traffic on the Georgia-to-Maine, US, footpath every year: More people than ever causing problems. \nAt Maine’s Baxter State Park, home to the trail’s final summit on Mount Katahdin, officials say thru-hikers are flouting park rules by openly using drugs and drinking alcohol, camping where they aren’t supposed to, and trying to pass their pets off as service dogs. \nHundreds of kilometres away, misbehaving hikers contributed to a small Pennsylvania community’s recent decision to shutter the sleeping quarters it had offered for decades in the basement of its municipal building. \nWith last year’s release of the movie Wild , about a woman’s journey on the Pacific Crest Trail, and what experts call a growing interest in outdoor activities, the number of people on the Appalachian Trail has exploded. And the numbers are only expected to climb further after A Walk in the Woods — a movie based on the 1998 Bill Bryson book about the Appalachian Trail- hits theatres this week. \nMore than 830 people completed the 3523-kilometre hike last year, up from just 182 in 1990, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, based in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. At Baxter, the number of registered long-distance hikers grew from 359 in 1991 to more than 2000 in 2014. Hikers from the move A Walk in the Woods .

Roaming into the wild.

I can’t imagine them wanting to do things that would violate the wilderness,” said Scott Jurek, an ultramarathoner from Colorado who last month completed the trail in a record time of 46 days, eight hours. \nAfter celebrating with a bottle of champagne at Katahdin’s summit, Jurek received citations for consuming alcohol, hiking with a large group and littering. He argued that the citations were unfair and that Baxter officials were using him to send a message to problem hikers. \nPolicies regarding alcohol vary by state and park. Dogs are allowed along most of the trail except for a few places, including Baxter. \nRon Tipton, executive director of the Conservancy, said the vast majority of thru-hikers are respectful and on the trail for the right reasons. He said he believes that the sharp increase in hikers has simply made it more challenging to deal with the behaviour of a few. \nHis group has implemented several initiatives to deal with the surge in trail use, such as encouraging people to start the path at different spots to better distribute hikers. It also recently held a meeting with Baxter officials to address the concerns about hiker behaviour and is dedicated to resolving the issues, Tipton said. \nWith the end of the trail in jeopardy, there’s much at stake, officials and hikers say. \n“Katahdin is such an icon; it’s such a prize that it motivates all kinds of people,” said Lester Kenway, president of the Maine Appalachian Trail Club. “Having the trail end somewhere short of that would be a disappointment for many of us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:35:50.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
