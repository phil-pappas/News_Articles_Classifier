And he didn’t look the part. \n“I was a very thin Brazilian guy,” he said. \nBut he threw himself into the role. \nHe moved to Medellín for six months to study Spanish in Escobar’s hometown. He gained 20 kilos (nearly 45 pounds) — which he is still struggling to shed, he admitted. He adopted the druglord’s look, from the mustache to the lopsided hairstyle. \nReviewers have praised the accuracy of his portrayal, which enabled the show’s director, fellow Brazilian Jose Padilha, to seamlessly splice historical footage of the real Escobar into the series. \n“Narcos,” which debuted Friday, recreates Escobar’s world through the eyes of Steve Murphy, an agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. He is played by Boyd Holbrook (“Gone Girl,”“Milk”), whose jaded narration of the cross-border operation against the Medellín Cartel frames the show. \nColombian police and military forces storm the rooftop where drug lord Pablo Escobar was shot dead just moments earlier during an exchange of gunfire between security forces and Escobar and his bodyguard on Dec. 2, 1993. AFP \nShot almost entirely on location in Colombia, the show features dialogue in both English and subtitled Spanish. \n“I don’t know anything in American television that looks like ‘Narcos.’ It’s spoken in two languages. It’s shot here in Colombia. It has a very international cast,” said Moura. \nNetflix spokeswoman Kari Perez said the U.S. video streaming giant sees the show as part of its “ongoing bet” on Latin America, where it first rolled out service in 2011. \n“We wanted to have to have a series that would work in two different worlds: It would be very interesting for an American audience [and] a Latin American audience,” said Padilha, the director. \n“And the way to do it was to tell the DEA story.” \nA complex killer \nPadilha made his name exploring the upside-down moral universe of cops and drug dealers in his native Brazil with “Elite Squad” (2007) and “Elite Squad: The Enemy Within” (2010), both of which starred Moura. \nA piercing critic of the war on drugs and its unintended consequences, he said “Narcos” gave him the chance to tell that story from both sides. \n“Escobar marks the beginning of the inflow of cocaine with volume into America and Europe,” he said in a Netflix press release. \n“He shaped history. … So, where else to begin?” \nHermilda de Escobar, second right, mother of Medellín drug cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar, walks with friends and relatives on Dec. 2, 1994 to Escobar’s tomb to celebrate the first anniversary of his death. AFP \nThe show — 10 episodes of 45 minutes each, all available immediately for Netflix’s 65 million subscribers — also features Chilean actor Pedro Pascal (“Game of Thrones”) and Mexican actress Stephanie Sigman (“Spectre,” the forthcoming James Bond movie). \nTwenty-two years after his death in a shootout with Colombian police on a Medellín rooftop, Escobar is still revered by some in the city as a Robin Hood figure who built them hospitals, schools and housing. \nOthers revile him for unleashing a campaign of terror on Colombia in his bid to avoid being extradited to the United States. \nMoura said he wanted to capture Escobar’s complexity in his portrayal. \n“I love the fact that he’s a very contradictory character,” he said. \n“He loved his family. He was loved — he’s still loved by a lot of people in Medellín. And he’s still one of the most terrible killers in modern history.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:18:06.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
