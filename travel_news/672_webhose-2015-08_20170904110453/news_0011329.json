We are united in our goal of driving the continued buoyant growth in the country’s travel sector. These are exciting times for Travelport, we recently completed the acquisition of MTT, a mobile Travel Commerce company at the forefront at the evolution of how travel is being consumed, and launched Smartpoint 6.0, the latest and most enhanced versions of our state of the art point of sale application designed for travel agencies and travel management companies(TMCs). This event provided a valuable face to face platform with our partners to reinforce our commitment and share the latest developments we have that will support their business growth,” said Rabih Saab, President & Managing Director, Africa, Middle East and South Asia, Travelport.\nMoustafa Khataw, Chairman TASOTA and CEO, Skylink Group Tanzania, commented: “This Travelport initiative provided a great opportunity for Tanzania’s leading travel industry players to get up to date on how technology is changing the face of travel commerce, how we can leverage these changes and keep up to date on technology trends that are affecting and growing our business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:05:58.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
