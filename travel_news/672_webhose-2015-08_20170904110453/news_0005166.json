I listen to the locals meet and greet their friends during their daily ritual on their way to work. \nIt truly is better entertainment for me than today’s TV selections. \nMy recent visit was to The White Castle on Central Avenue in Clark, N.J.. This could very well have been the birthplace of the famous New Jersey “Death Ball”—a greasy hamburger about the size of a quarter. (The coffee is good.) \nI was nestled in the corner hiding behind my open laptop when a policeman walked in and greeted the grill master. He then started chatting with another regular stool patron as they both propped themselves up against the counter. \nI tuned in. \nNo such thing as loyalty The officer of the law apparently had a tree cutting business when he wasn’t arresting the bad guys. It sounded like his equipment always needed fixing and he was strapped for cash. (Sound familiar?) \nHe then shared a story about a customer and declared in just short of a raised voice that there was no such thing as loyalty today. \nHis story began with him, the cop, providing all sorts of information to a man whose tree limb just fell on his house. He provided the homeowner with all sorts of sage advice along with an accurate quote for removing the limb from his roof. \nHe left the homeowner to study the quote as he moved onto the next fallen limb down the street. The cop soon received an email requesting a phone call. He mistakenly placed this task on his to-do list. \nI don’t know how much time passed, but when the cop got around to dialing the prospect back, he received another email from the homeowner saying, ”Since I did not hear back from you, I gave the job to another guy.” \nAnother unhappy ending to what could have been a decent payday. (The cop had four kids heading for college and he could have used the extra scratch.) \nResponding quickly: it’s crucial A few things come to mind from this story. \nIt underscores the importance today of getting back to prospects quickly. Your definition of “soon enough” may not be the prospect’s definition. The truth is that the people holding the wallet are the ones holding the trump card. \nI am sure Officer Krupke was a skilled officer of the law, but I had to question his business acumen, along with his choice of a healthy breakfast. (He ordered a donut to complete his three-egg breakfast with white toast and what looked like a pound of butter.) \nPerhaps he should have mentioned to the homeowner that he would get back to him later that day around 2 pm. This would have told the prospect that he took this assignment seriously without appearing too aggressive. \nRemember the homeowner had a tree on his roof and this was a major priority in this guy’s life. I am not certain, but I am betting the police-tree-man might have interpreted this situation as “business-as-usual.” After all nobody got hurt and there were no guns involved. \nToo many choices Let me wrap up today’s message(s). \nFirst: Loyalty may not be a total thing of the past, but I too feel it is very close to being yesterday’s news. “What have you done for me lately” is more the norm in today’s option-heavy marketplace. \nSecond: In a world where instant gratification seems to be the rule, speed has become more important than ever. Buyers have too many choices to be put on “hold” for too long. The definition of “too” is up to the buyer. \nBonus Message – Three: If you are looking for a little entertainment and you have a few hours to spare, go hang out at morning coffee shops.
