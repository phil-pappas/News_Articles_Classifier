With the recent rapid innovative growth of athletic clothing, equipment, and wearables, Design Exchange (DX), Canada's Design Museum, has kicked off the satellite exhibition, Smarter. Faster. Tougher . which dives into the evolution of sportswear. Hot off the heels of the PanAm Games, the sports fever is still high as this exhibition runs full speed ahead until October 12 th .\nLocated in the Distillery District, Smarter. Faster.
