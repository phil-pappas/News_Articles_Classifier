Popular Stories   \nWITH a television in front of him and a beer in hand, Mister Black could have been mistaken for an Aussie bloke watching sport on a couch. \nLying back, head resting on hand, Mister Black was not shy about scratching his armpits or his - erm - nether regions in front of us. \nAnd just like an Aussie who has sunk a few beers, he would occasionally stand up and strike a pose for his admirers - turning so everyone got an eyeful. \nConsidering some scientists suggest chimpanzees share more than 98% DNA with humans, I suppose it's not surprising there are many similarities in the way they behave. \nWhen looking into the eyes of the older chimps, it's like looking into their souls. \nBut we chicks could probably learn a thing or two from their mating rituals. \nThe guides taking groups trekking through the Kibale forest in Uganda tell us the men have to bring the females food if they want a bit of loving. \nIt's usually berries or other fruit from the trees you see them effortlessly swinging between, and shaking to release said treats. \nBut, unlike many other primates, chimpanzees will also eat little snakes or piglets and other meat if it's on offer. \nIf the female chimpanzees don't like the look of the male, they shun him. \nIf he doesn't bring enough food, same deal. \nApparently he has to peel off the leaves or prepare the meal for her and must whisper sweet nothings in her ear. \nThen he pees on it, she eats it and he gets some \"jiggy jiggy\". \nI think we can safely leave the urination part of the ritual in the forest. \nBut the guides tell us the woman is in complete control of the situation in the bedroom department. \nThey say she can have sex more than 50 times a day, sometimes with males lining up, while the boys average seven times daily. \nBut this promiscuity in chimpanzee-land might be easily explained - with the guides evoking much laughter as they say the men last just five to seven seconds. \nThere were 120 chimps in the family we trekked to find in Uganda. \nThey are a little elusive so our guides had to look for droppings and keep a keen ear for their calls. \nThey do regularly call out to each other because they think the food source is better if they split up. \nOnce you finally track down our mesmerising relatives - you'll see them swing easily from branch to branch high above. \nBut many have been habituated so they're not shy and happy to come down and entertain the crowds too. \nThe writer travelled to Uganda with Intrepid as part of an East Africa overland tour. \nThe tour stayed at one of numerous camping grounds near the Kibale Forest. \nTOP STORIES ONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:16:13.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
