It’s comparable to the gluten-free craze we’ve all endured as of late. Recently, we embarked on a quest, a real quest, to excavate the meaning of farm-to-table in one of the oldest foodie regions in Europe, Tuscany. \nThe Tuscany region of Italy is, in and of itself, the cradle of stereotype. Stone towers perch on ridges like birds of prey, surveying the gentle slope of green fields beneath them. Roosters strut along endless serpentine coils of grape vines and each vantage point is a fresco you’ve seen somewhere in your schooling. \nFor this endeavor, we enlisted the help of our good friends at Walks of Italy . They’ve been helping us devour Italy piece by piece over the years and they have yet to lead us astray. \nWe didn’t really know much about Tuscany before we embarked. At a glance, it is an area in central Italy that encompasses just under 9,000 square miles. It is an agricultural empire that has an almost religious zeal for food. Cooking and eating are pursued with a passion usually only reserved for soccer (futbol) and love. One of our guides told us that he had come to Italy from New York to study his Italian. In the beginning he had a hard time finding anyone who wanted to practice Italian with him. The secret to his eventual success was to walk into a local market and ask what the best way to prepare an ingredient was. Within moments he had a small group of people all passionately arguing in Italian over the true art of cooking. We were here to discover some hint of the origins of this passion. \nStarting in the cobblestoned streets of Florence, we slowly crawled out of the river valley through a series of switchbacks, ascending languidly up and away from the towers crowned in wood smoke. \nSiena \nWe made a straight line for Siena. One may already be familiar with Siena and not even know it. This rustic medieval city is the setting for the opening scene of James Bond’s Quantum of Solace . If you witnessed 007 bounding from roof top to balcony, then you have already experienced the charm of Siena. The city still hosts Il Palio, an annual horse race in the center of the town — a tradition to prove the superiority of one of the 17 contrada (or neighborhoods that comprise Siena, each with a proper medieval banner). \nOur guide, who bore a striking resemblance to Nina Dobrev, led us through the streets of Siena showing us the finest parts. The culinary backbone of this region is remarkably simple: wild pork, prized beef, bread, olive oil, wine and saffron are ubiquitous. The Tuscan philosophy seems to be to perfect a single ingredient rather than diluting it with foreign ones. \nWe dipped into Pizzicheria De Miccoli, a specialty store that sells wild pork and local cheeses and is denoted by the spectacle-wearing boar above the door. Across the street is a local market. “This is the main market for this neighborhood,” our guide tells us. You need only glance at the labels to see that everything on the shelves is from a local farm and there is an involvement in the food, from start to finish. The butcher even carves the prosciutto to your specifications, in front of you. \nTo get a real taste of Siena, stop into La Vecchia Latteria to get a sampling of the finest homemade gelato in the city. Or consider any of the local bakeries that line the tangle of streets. Keep your eyes open for brutti ma buoni , directly translated to “ugly but good.” They are unshapely little almond cakes/cookies that will blow your mind. \nTenuta Casanova \nIntent on getting back to the literal roots of this place, we headed out of the back gate of Siena and into the low countryside that lapped against its walls. \nOutside of Siena we stopped at a small cottage that was seemingly being swallowed up in an ocean of rosemary. Boars rutted along the bases of fruit trees. Along the edge of the path that led up to the front door, vineyards lapped at the gravel. Each row was punctuated with either a rose bush or an artichoke plant. These sentinels attract the same pests that will attack grapes, however, the bugs prefer roses and will eat them first. If the owner of a vineyard notices their roses in distress, they will take care of the pests with copper dust before they can assault the vines. It is an ancient and ingenious way of keeping the vineyards of Tuscany pesticide free. This picture of charm is known as Tenuta Casanova , the project of love of Rita and Silvano. \nThey raise boar, hunt truffles, tend to bees, craft wine, coax grapes along on the vine, and above all, love the land. This is their farm, their vineyard, their passion. Silvano’s truffle hound bayed in the distance as he greeted us at the door. A personal tour of the facility was in order. He took us past a basketball-sized collection of bees all clinging together in a tree. \n“They are swarming today. I will put them in a new hive this evening,” Silvano told us. This is a process he will do by hand, with only heavy leather gloves on. He is connected to his craft. Beyond the bees, Silvano showed us his wine cellar and took us barrel by barrel through his collection of balsamic. We didn’t know before this journey into the heart of Tuscany that balsamic is merely pressed grape juice that has been left to evaporate. As the water dissipates you are left with a balsamic that grows thicker every year. We mention this to Silvano and he looked at us as if we had struck his child. \n“It does not merely evaporate,” he pleads. “The wine of the grape matures into its true self.” \nHe takes us along the barrels — one year, five years, 10 years — his voice becoming more reverent as he progresses. When we arrive at the 30-year barrel, hardly the size of a one-liter cask, he whispers. Producing a bottle of the coveted 30, he places a single drop on a tiny plastic spoon — one for each of us in the party. It was a cosmic experience. The complexity and robust intricacies of the balsamic left to mature for 30 years was like listening to a symphony with your mouth. \nThe most important event here is the dinner. Under a rough-hewn pergola, draped in vines and surrounded by the shimmer of peacocks strutting in the background, Silvano sets a table prepared by his wife, Rita. Plate after plate arrives and Silvano introduces each article upon them as if he was introducing a friend of his. A sliver of sheep milk cheese drizzled in honey (from the farm) and crowned with balsamic (from the cellar) leads the foray and makes us believers. Each dish is served with wine, of course. Each mouthful leads up to a handmade gelato with the tiniest drizzle of balsamic atop. We saw these grapes. We smelled these bees. We ouched these vegetables. We have been a part of our meal today. \nIt is important to note that all the wine and balsamic are only available here, on the farm. They can be shipped, but you will only ever discover them a stones throw from their creation. It is easy to taste Tuscany in every bite, because you are perched on a hill above it, with it buzzing all around you. \nFattoria Poggio Alloro \nThis was not the final stop on our quest however, we had another farm to visit. This time we drove to the tower studded city of San Gimignano. This medieval city is brimming with saffron vendors, bakers and butchers that approach their crafts with proud devotion. \nBeneath the shadow of San Gimignano lies a small farm with a rich tradition. Fattoria Poggio Alloro was established by three brothers who moved to the region in the mid 1950s. They have cultivated a haven for wine, cattle and saffron. The cattle are Chianina, a breed domesticated and bred by the Romans over 2,000 years prior. Before that, they were the genesis of several herds in Asia and Africa. They are the predecessors of several cattle in the USA and bear the distinction of being one of the oldest breeds of cattle in the world. Oddly enough, the Chianina are now under risk of extinction. Under the careful eye of the Fioroni brothers this small herd continues to thrive in their native Tuscany. \nFattoria Poggio Alloro is also home to Chianti. Chianti is that charming bottle you’re familiar with that comes wrapped in a basket weave, often atop a checkered table cloth. Chianti is primarily made from Sangiovese, a thin skinned grape ideal for soaking up the Tuscan sun. The Chianti region is the oldest official wine zone in the world, established in 1716. Not unlike Champagne, it derives its name as a regional moniker. A true Chianti must be from the Chianti region and will bear the mark of the black rooster on its label. All of these distinctions conspire to create the necessary majesty and reverence that the region commands. \nThis is the birth of farm-to-table as we should know it. At Fattoria Poggio Alloro we were introduced to a flight of true Tuscan wines and our new favorite, a local bruschetta. Here, olive oil is tended to with the same dedication and pursuit of perfection as wine. In Tuscany you sample olive oil in a small cup, like a wine tasting. The most common way to test the flavor though, is on a piece of local Tuscan bread, grilled and rubbed with garlic, before it is lightly brushed with olive oil. \nOur quest through Tuscany was brief. By the time the sun started setting we had been stuffed beyond our limit and sleep seemed like the most sensible course of action. It was easy to see how farm-to-table had caught on. In Tuscany you can still find a table at the farm of your choice and taste food as it was prepared 2,000 years ago. You can indulge in the flavors of the sun and the rain, and taste a warm Italian greeting all in the span of a moment. \nTo truly get back to the origin of farm-to-table, consider a trip to the Tuscan countryside and indulge in the still vibrant traditions of quality and care. Being a part of the food process has never been so delicious. \nGet a sneak peek in the video:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T21:29:16.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
