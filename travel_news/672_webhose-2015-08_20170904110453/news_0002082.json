From August 2015 the Unlimited Spa promotion will offer guests the chance to enjoy two hours of spa treatment per day stayed at the special rate of just VND 1,200,000 per guest per day (around £29). The promotion joins Vinpearl’s existing programme of offers such as its great value Spa Package, running until November 30, 2015, offering even more choices for wellness fans looking to holiday in Vietnam. \nThe new 1,000 sqm Vincharm Spa is set on a lush secluded promontory at Vinpearl Premium NhaTrang Bay, in the north western corner of Hon Tre Island in NhaTrang, Vietnam. It is based around an overwater complex of thatched spa huts arranged over a manmade lake and connected by lantern-lit raised walkways. It features ten treatment rooms, including a couples suite, along with steam, sauna and Jacuzzi facilities, plus a separate manicure and pedicure area. This is all backed by a state of the art fitness centre, with personal trainers available on request. Plus, the area around NhaTrang is famous for rejuvenating mud baths. It is the second Vincharm Spa on Hon Tre Island, the first being located at the Vinpearl Luxury NhaTrang whose four luxurious secluded overwater Spa huts, open 9am to 10pm daily, are perched on stilts at the ocean’s edge and accessed by lantern-lit wooden walkways. Vinpearl is set to open three more hotels in Vietnam by year-end, each of which will feature its own Vincharm Spa with at least 15 treatment beds. Vinpearl Premium Phu Quoc, the second property in its rapidly expanding integrated resort complex on Vietnam’s tropical Phu Quoc island, will open in October 2015; Vinpearl Resort Ha Long, near the popular tourist centre of Halong Bay, will open in November 2015; and Vinpearl Premium Golf Land NhaTrang, the operator’s fourth hotel on Hon Tre Island, will open in December 2015. Each Vincharm Spa menu contains a comprehensive programme of Vietnamese treatments alongside options such as Deep Tissue, Four Hands and Thai style offerings, plus indulgent wellness packages such as Reshape, Relax and Replenish. Products used include Vincharm moisturising Body Oils for body and foot treatments and Sothys of France products for facials The wide range of treatments offered by the company’s Thai-trained spa therapists include its signature Vietnamese spa treatment, Bamboo Therapy, which as its name implies incorporates bamboo into the administration of the treatment, promoting general wellbeing by relieving pain around pressure points, easing muscle tension and relaxing the body. Duong Thi Mai Hoa, the chief executive officer of Vinpearl’s parent company Vingroup, said: “Our five-star, full-service Vincharm Spa and wellness offering is a central part of Vinpearl’s integrated resorts concept, sitting alongside other elements such as our Vinpearl Land amusement clubs and Championship-standard Vinpearl Golf Clubs, and it’s proved incredibly popular, not only with our hotel guests but with travellers experiencing our urban spas in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. “Our highly-trained therapists offer a very comprehensive spa menu of treatments and full body packages, from Vietnamese to Thai and Chinese style, so if you’re looking to give your Body, Mind and Soul a break on a relaxing break in Asia then look no further than Vinpearl.” She added: “Moreover, from July 01, 2015 citizens of the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain no longer need to acquire a Visa for stays of 15 days or less in Vietnam. And with Vietnam Airlines launching its new non-stop service to Vietnam from London Heathrow using Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners – the first airline to launch such a service between Europe and South East Asia – there really has never been a better time to book a relaxing wellness break with Vinpearl.” In addition, the Vincharm Spa at Vinpearl Premium Da Nang, open daily from 8:30am to 10:00pm, features nine treatment rooms, with further wellness opportunities provided by activities such as yoga and Tai Chi and facilities such as the five pools and floodlit tennis courts. Meanwhile the 10,000 sqft Vincharm Spa at the Vinpearl Resort PhuQuoc on tropical PhuQuoc Island, which opened on November 01, 2014 and is open 9am to 9pm daily, features a range of open-sided spa huts arranged around a manmade lake, popular with joggers. Vinpearl also operates Vincharm Spas in the country’s two main gateway cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The former, located in the Vincom Centre’s Tower C, spans more than 3,000 sqm and features 22 treatment rooms backed by a state of the art fitness centre, 500 sqm indoor swimming pool and facilities such as steam rooms, saunas, Jacuzzi.
