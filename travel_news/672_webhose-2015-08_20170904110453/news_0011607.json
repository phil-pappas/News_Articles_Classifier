According to Hindu mythology, gods and demons waged a furious battle over the nectar they needed to achieve immortality. Four drops spilled, landing in the four cities that alternatively host the festival: Allahabad, at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythic Saraswati rivers; Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganges; Ujjain, in central India; and Nasik.\nThe festival is held four times every 12 years.\nIndian devotees perform rituals as they take holy dips in the Godavari River during Kumbh Mela, or Pitcher Festival, in Nasik, India, Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015.
