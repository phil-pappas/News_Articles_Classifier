A completely new hospitality concept combining hotel and serviced apartments, Banyan Tree’s newest brand, Cassia, features cutting-edge design, colourful street art and customised living and dining options. Opening within the Group’s integrated beach resort of Laguna Phuket, Cassia Phuket has been designed for families, friends and couples seeking the freedom to create their own space, craft their own holiday and fully immerse themselves in the local culture and environment. \nCassia Phuket brings a fresh approach to hospitality with 221 stylish residences complemented by a special opening offer that can be tailored to the specific needs of guests. Cassia Phuket redefines hotel living with a choice of stylish one and two-bedroom apartments, each with a separate living room and fully-equipped kitchen. Many will feature a loft hang-out with fabulous views of the lagoon, ocean or park. Each apartment offers comfortable living space for guests to relax with their partner and kids or party with friends. Cassia Phuket offers a unique hotel residence experience with opportunities for guests to connect with friends and make new ones. Cassia Friends (the nickname for Cassia’s staff) are on hand to take care of guests and recommend the best local sights and sounds; from sunbathing on the best beaches and checking out Phuket’s spectacular night scene; to enjoying island-hopping tours, spa massages and Thai boxing classes. Cassia Friends will be the guests’ go-to team for an enjoyable holiday. During pre-arrival, guests can choose different stay options on the website – preferred apartment packages, airport transfer methods, spa and room add-ons, a la-carte housekeeping and tour packages. Guests choose what they pay for at Cassia Phuket. Upon arrival, the hotel’s Meeting Point counter allow guests to go through a paperless check-in process, aligned with Banyan Tree’s sustainability standards. During their stay, guests are connected with a free super-fast WI-FI, can nosh up with a Tiffin-box breakfast, make new friends and choose from endless activities. Guests are encouraged to share reviews of their stay on the hotel’s social media channels and most importantly, have fun. Instead of elaborate F&B options, Cassia allows guests to keep dining easy with casual concepts, Market 23 Cafe and Street Bar. Market 23 Cafe, the hotel’s buzzing social hub, will be one of the highlights of the new property. A stylish gathering spot to socialise or chill out, this café and mini convenience mart invites guests to sip gourmet coffee in the morning while updating their Instagram, make new friends over the food counter, or purchase drinks, sundries, fresh food and grab-n-go meals for later. At the adjacent Street Bar, partygoers can sip cocktails and listen to the in-house DJ while admiring the original works of famed Thai street artists RUKKIT and TikkyWOW. Guests who prefer to dine-in can cook their favourite home-made meals in their own kitchen using ingredients purchased from Market 23 Cafe or the local market, just a few minutes away from the property. Those who prefer home delivery, can also order from local restaurants or take away directly from street vendors. Cassia Phuket boasts original features such as mezzanine areas and 24-hours seamless Wi-Fi for comfortable, fuss-free living as well as a wide collection of facilities including pools, a gym, mini convenience mart, home-delivery service and touch-screen concierge. Two swimming pools and direct access to the stunning Bang Tao Beach mean guests can swim and sunbathe when they wish. And whether their goal is to gain inner nirvana or gear up for the next beach party, guests will be able to enjoy quick and soothing massages and facials, as well as nail and waxing treatments at Chill-Chill Spa. From island-hopping and shopping tours, to a visit to the Cherngtalay Night Market for a unique Thai experience, guests looking to exploring beyond the hotel can participate in diverse activities specially crafted by the Cassia team.
