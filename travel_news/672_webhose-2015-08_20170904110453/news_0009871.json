Even a single tool will not be able to land-up with a decent price. But you can try different ways to save on the deals. \nIt is true that any one application or website or tool cannot find you the best deals that you have been looking for. The rates, rules and regulations keeps on changing with time and demand, making it quite difficult for people to get the same deals and offers every time. \nThe charges of the hotel room change almost every day based on the demands. At some point of time, a particular site may have the best deal for your desired hotel room, but at another time some other website may have it. Sometimes visiting the hotel directly or calling them up can get you some good deals as well. \nThere is some tips following which can land you with some good deals for your hotel booking. \nContact the hotel directly: It’s good to call up the specific location, hotel directly before booking a room. This would give you the exact rates that the hotel is offering and if it’s matching or beating the online rates you found. Doing so can help you in ways like no advance payment, no dealing with third party if something goes wrong and you can even come across cheaper rates. \nBe sure about the total cost beforehand: There can be chances that the hotels you have booked charges extra for some of the facilities that were not mentioned in the online quote. Such facilities can be like resort fee, Wi-Fi, breakfast or use of Gym. So to avoid unkind surprises, don’t forget to ask about which fees are included and which are not. \nConsider some alternate large accommodation: If your tour plan includes a family or a long stay, consider renting an apartment or house in your destination. These types of accommodations are available in plenty in almost all cities. Even renting a house with a kitchen can help you save on food because you can cook some meals yourself. \nCheck what other travelers are paying: This is possible in some of the latest search and comparison websites online, where you can find out what other travelers have paid for the same quality hotel in different booking websites. \nTry to be extra careful with advanced payments: Carefully go through all the fine prints, in case you booked a service which needs advance payment. Also check the amount that you would be charged in case you cancel it for some reason. \nBuy a package if possible: Packages are sometimes very profitable. So if your plans are for travelling to just one destination, search for a deal that would provide hotel, airfare and car rental all together in one package. This can be cheaper and easier than booking them individually. \nCheck the deals with the local tourist offices: Many local travel agencies offer room-finding services for same-day rooms. Some of them gets a list every morning of the rooms that the hotels in their locality want to sell for that night. So getting in touch with them can help you land up with a brilliant last minute deal from a quality hotel in London .
