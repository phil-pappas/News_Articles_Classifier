As the artistry of earth’s tectonic plates moved upward, this geological beauty called Yosemite was born. On this nature’s palette, was the creation of mile high waterfalls, majestic Sequoias, and unmatched splendor. Famed naturalist John Muir said of Yosemite, \"No temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite in stern immovable majesty, how softly these mountain rocks are adorned and how fine and reassuring the company they keep.” Yosemite is the home of over 350 animal species, 1,400 types of flowers, and 37 types of trees. By vehicle or by hiking, everyone can enjoy Yosemite. Many areas of the National Park are those that one can spend hours on end, just sitting back and watching. Yosemite Falls is a 2,425 foot waterfall that cascades over a thunderous ledge that appears ever so gentle as it reaches the valley floor. The 620-foot Bridalveil Falls is equally as impressive. From many vantage points, view El Capitan. The 3,593 foot El Capitan is the largest single granite monolith in the world. Visit the 700-year-old sequoia trees. The trees tower to unimaginable heights. A spectacular place with forever views is Glacier Point. From Glacier Point, you can see Vernal and Yosemite Falls, Half-Dome in the distance, and even Nevada. Visitors frequently see glimpses of American black bears, coyotes, or bighorn sheep. For the adventurous in body and spirit, a hike to the top of Half Dome may be just the medicine you need. Half Dome is 5,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level. Hiking Half Dome is a 14 to 16 mile round trip, with most hikers taking 10 to 12 hours or more to complete this adventure. Two metal cables allow for hikers to attempt the final 400 feet of the climb. The cables have been in place since 1919. If you are going for the whole climb, be sure you have excellent climbing shoes, water, and good gloves to grasp the cables. There are dozens of other hiking destinations that are much easier to enjoy. Hike through the forests and to lakes of pristine quality. Camping around the Yosemite area takes some planning. The campgrounds that require reservations are usually full from April through September. Many of these campgrounds are open seasonally. Winters can see generous amounts of snow. We all hope and pray that this winter season blesses Yosemite with healthy snowfall. The entire Yosemite and Sierra range thirst from the drought that has lasted far too long. From Interstate 395 (Russ and Lori’s favorite scenic route), take Highway 120 out of Lee Vining. Becoming Tioga Road, your first campground will be Tuolumne Meadows. You can continue to Porcupine Flat and White Wolf campgrounds. Some folks prefer to take the lower route out of Fresno. From Fresno, take Highway 41 to Wawona campground. Continue north and you will come to Glacier Point Road. Head east to Bridalveil Creek campground. All roads to these campgrounds are paved. It’s a best bet to call ahead, make reservations far in advance, and ensure that your RV is appropriate for the particular campground of choice. Some campgrounds have RV size limits. Remember that most of these roads were built and designed for smaller rigs than the one’s we see today. That is a part of this area’s beauty. You can navigate these roads, but be extra cautious. Drive slowly, as it is not unusual for a critter of some sort to meander across the road. Visit Yosemite and enjoy all that it has to offer. So, Let’s Get Rollin!
