I don’t see this as just a one-off – I expect to see it improving over time. \n“It is part of a long-term campaign to make sure that Plymouth punches above its weight, in particular to cement the relationship with near Europe, and Brittany Ferries are a key component for that.” \nThe Foreign Office’s current travel advice has noted the industrial action by the farmers and ferry workers, as well as the disruption caused by the illegal migrants in and around Calais. \nTheir advice states: “You should keep vehicle doors locked in slow moving traffic and secure your vehicle when it is left unattended.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:39:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
