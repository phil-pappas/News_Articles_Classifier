After a successful beta program in California, RV inventory will now be available for rent in all 50 states. Outdoorsy offers a secure platform that handles all phases of the transaction, including availability calendar, reservations, deposits, cashless payments, while offering 24-hour support to renters and owners. Now anyone can hit the road and enjoy the industrys first $1 million insurance policy covering both domestic and international travelers. \nThe RV industry is a massive $32 billion market and growing at a record pace. More than 12 percent of American households own an RV but the majority will go unused 11.5 months out of the year. While owners investments sit idle in the driveway many carry the burden of loan payments, storage and maintenance costs that can exceed $16,000 annually. Outdoorsy recognized an opportunity to unlock these underutilized assets. The company has created a new platform for RV owners to recoup some or even all of their costs while providing unprecedented access for the 45.6 million Americans who camp each year, but who have been priced out of RV ownership. RV rentals have traditionally been served by expensive brick & mortar dealerships and brokers. Outdoorsys community-dri \nThe Outdoorsy.co platform offers a wide range of benefits to travelers, including: · Easily search and discover a broad variety of RVs personally cared for by their owners that suit a variety of tastes and needs. · Book an RV directly through Outdoorsy without the hassle of having to go through traditional RV rental call centers or manually search through paper directories. · Communicate directly with owners who want to share their knowledge and often assist with advice and road trip itineraries. · Save money and enjoy more frequent, unique vacations as RVing is a cost-effective way to travel (24-59 percent less expensive than traditional travel). \nFor owners of RVs, Outdoorsy.co turns their idle asset into a money stream and allows them to realize potentially life-changing financial benefits. RV owners can: · Earn up to $86,000 per year renting their RV(s) · List their RV for free through a simple step-by-step process · Handpick pre-qualified renters through reviewing profiles, ratings and reviews and remain in complete control of who rents · Set rates and availability and only accept bookings they are comfortable with · Receive secure direct payments made directly into their bank account · Enjoy 24/7 customer service \nnnectedness of everyday life, says Jen Young, co-founder of Outdoorsy. At Outdoorsy, we arent just looking to create the next big thing in the sharing economy, we want to create a community of passionate outdoor enthusiasts who are looking to connect and share their experiences with others. With Outdoorsy, users can experience the open road wherever, whenever and however they want.  \nOutdoorsy was founded by a team of experienced professionals and travelers: Jeff Cavins, Jennifer Young, Tyler Burnell, and Ryan Quinn.
