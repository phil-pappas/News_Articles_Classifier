Pit your wits against the best! See if you too can fail to predict what will happen in the greatest sporting battle on Earth! This summer’s roller-coaster Ashes series, this ancient display of snorting sporting enmity, has so far proved that successful punditry is neither art nor science. It is a futile exercise in turning round a few times in a makeshift blindfold and stabbing wildly at a small balloon with a rolling pin. In an exhilarating series of car crash TV the only thing that has been predictable is its capriciousness. Who honestly knew which England team would turn up at Edgbaston – the supine batting side who collapsed into themselves at Lord’s, losing by 405 runs, or the carefree Cardiff cavaliers? Who had a clue which Jimmy Anderson would puff up his quiff at Birmingham – the busted flush accused of giving up on the Lord’s featherbed or the artful, unplayable seam-demon who would take six for 47 on Wednesday. Who correctly foresaw either the fairytale in motion that was Steven Finn’s rebirth or the brutal realpolitik of the Australian selectors who dropped Brad Haddin while he was in a personal crisis. Jimmy Anderson will miss the fourth Test with a side injury Winning the toss on Wednesday was vital, and then it was not. Stodgy captain Cook has not turned out to be that way at all, and the pressure is now on wiry, wily Michael Clarke (94 runs in three Tests). And so we run alongside faster and faster, talking and listening and writing and tweeting and commenting below the line and working ourselves into a frenzy of confusion – red lorry, yellow lorry, red lolly, lellow lorry, led lolly, lellow lolly... Which side are the more united? Who has the greater mental strength? The upper hand the commentator holds is his or her knowledge. But the past few weeks seem to have rendered evidence-based decisions superfluous. The plural of anecdote may very well not be data, but the plural of data does not give any answers either. At the end of this delicious glut of Ashes cricket – by the fourth week of this month we will have squeezed in 15 Tests in just over 25 months – we are no more likely to be able to predict what will happen than that first morning of July in 2013. Michael Clarke has struggled for form on this Ashes tour The coming two Tests will be the final time England fans see Clarke, Mitchell Johnson or Chris Rogers as well as Anderson and probably Stuart Broad in a home Ashes. English cricket is on its fourth coach since the summer of 2013, and has said farewell to Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior and Graeme Swann. Australian cricket too has gone through the mill – with the rise and rise of Johnson but the awful death of Phillip Hughes. The heroes of 2013 – remember Ashton Agar’s joyful 98 batting at No 11 at Nottingham – are already starting to yellow into history. At the other end that day Hughes made a patient 81. With an early finish there are five days until the start of the fourth Test. Five days to work up a lather of confusion. Because it does not much matter whether the expert, or the layman, gets it right or wrong as half the fun of anything is in the anticipation. Punditry is dead! Long live the pundit!
