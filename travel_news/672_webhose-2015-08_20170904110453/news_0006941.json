With zillions of flights to the market, fares into O’Hare can be half the price as regional airports within a 300-mile radius. When Marco got his green card to live in the United States, his one-way ticket from Italy was less than half the price to Chicago as it was to Detroit. On the flip side, it is a 275 mile hike from Detroit to O’Hare, but considering how wonderful the price was, the sojourn was worth my drive. \nOf course, Chicago has a lot of fun attractions for tourists. Although the sole purpose of traveling to O’Hare was to pick up Marco and take him home, we felt a weekend getaway was warranted, considering the money we were saving by his arriving in this alternative city. The airport lies a full hour west of downtown Chicago, and road traffic between the two points is notoriously wretched, as well as costly due to tolls. We opted to enjoy our weekend getaway at places nearby O’Hare so there was little commute and no toll roads required. \nPicking Marco up at O’Hare was a breeze. I parked in a handicap spot in front of the monorail in parking lot E; it was approximately 30 seconds away from the transit building. An elevator took me up to the entry of the monorail. In about five minutes, the monorail stopped at the international arrivals building; I took the elevator down one floor where I kept an eye open for Marco. During my short wait, I ordered a diet coke from the McDonalds located at the same exit; it was an act of common courtesy since I was using one of their chairs. Once Marco appeared, we went up one floor on the elevator, boarded the monorail, and was back in our car within ten minutes. My cost for parking was only two dollars. \nFinding a hotel near O’Hare can be a little tricky, because the facility is officially part of the city of Chicago proper; in reality, it is an exclave surrounded by the cities of Elk Grove, Des Plaines, Rosemont and Schiller Park. We chose the Sheraton Suites Elk Grove for three nights because hotel was free for us. \nWhen we signed up for the Starwood American Express card, we received 30,000 bonus points, and the Sheraton wanted only 3500 points per night for a suite. We loved this property; I’m a gold elite member of Starwood and I got an upgrade to the Club floor, which provided tasty breakfasts, evening hors d’oeuvres, and decadent night time brownies. The Club Lounge also offered free internet and beverages. Additionally, at check in, an amazingly courteous young man named Hernan gave us a gift ticket to try some hoity toity wine free at the hotel bar. \nOur room on the top floor overlooked Apple Vacations’ headquarters, and a series of beautiful man-made water ponds with fountains. Measuring about 400 square feet, our suite offered plenty of room for my rollator walker; and the entire property was wheelchair friendly. There was a generous amount of handicap parking available. \nAfter a perfect night on Sheraton’s “Sweet Sleeper” bed we drove ten minutes south of the airport to the Patronato ACLI in Stone Park. It is the organization where Italians notify Rome they are now living in America, and want their social security checks sent to the United States. The bureau is affiliated with the Catholic Church, and during our appointment a priest walked into the room, hoping to persuade us to take a pilgrimage with him on a church bus. Another person at the building managed to get us to buy some raffle tickets. Another wanted us to eat Nonna Graziella’s panini at the little “Casa Italia” behind the building. We were praying to escape any nuns bent on coaxing us into staying for granny bingo or spilling out our hearts in a confession booth. We did, as luck would have it, get invited to a birthday party for the priest. As an American, I was expecting a cold, impersonal situation similar to visiting the Social Security Office or Department of Motor Vehicles; Italians, however, take a very personalized and familial approach to these things. \nA few minutes east of O’Hare is Hala Kahiki Tiki Bar. We love La Mariana’s Tiki Bar in Honolulu, so we wanted to check out Chicago’s Hala Kahiki. I made a reservation four days in advance, because we read on internet reviews the place can get really packed on weekends. When we showed up and gave my name, we were told my name was not in the reservation book. I was bitterly disappointed with the irresponsible behavior of the bartender who took my call, but fortunately we had arrived just in time to avoid standing. We were seated at a table for two in the kitschy 1960’s bar room; on one hand it’s rather tacky, on the other, it’s fun and unpretentious. Looks can be deceiving: we found the exotic vegetable chips with mango salsa to be first class munchies. The colorful drinks with paper umbrellas and frou-frou vessels were delightful to experience. There are no prices on the menu, so I advise you take plenty of money; paradise, or faux paradise does not come cheap. \nThe highlight of our weekend was a visit to Medieval Times Dinner Theatre in nearby Schaumburg. This family-friendly, handicap-friendly mega-attraction is a delightful performing arts venue, with a show inspired by an 11th century feast and tournament. There were a zillion kids at this performance, possibly because of the “kids are free” and “free on your birthday” specials. There is plenty of handicap parking, and a special row inside the theatre for guests who do not climb stairs. I have to say I loved the food; it was super mild, just the way I like it. We were served tomato bisque soup, oven roasted chicken, herbed potatoes, corn on the cob, garlic bread, pastry and soft drinks. \nI could eat that fare every day! The show was to die for. An army of knights somersaulted here and there, jumped from horse to horse, “fought” with swords, and wooed the audience with their devilishly handsome looks. The choreography was magnificent; these tournament actors are at the top of their class. The equines are trained from birth to perform stunts almost impossible to get any horse to do. There is also a plot to the storyline, and it’s not the repulsive one where a bratty princess announces she wants all knights to fight to the death to win her hand in marriage. It’s far classier than that. \nO’Hare is an attractive option for many who need to fly into the Midwest and obtain substantial savings on their airfares. We found better than half-price savings by checking out Matrix ITAsoftware before purchasing a one-way flight from Milan to America. We use the tool often, and were very pleased to turn the Chicago landing into a fun weekend getaway. \nFollow Dr. Anton Anderssen on Twitter @Hartforth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T11:40:41.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
