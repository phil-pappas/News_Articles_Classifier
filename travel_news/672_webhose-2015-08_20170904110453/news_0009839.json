ADVERTISEMENT Gear and Gadgets: Style Rx 7-Day Designer Pill Box Case \nMany of us whose travel essentials include daily pills rely on those plastic seven-day medicine holders with SMTWTFS stamped across the snap-open compartments. A company called Inspired by Dawn has found a way to dress up those dowdy pill holders. The Style Rx 7-Day Designer Pill Box Case looks like a slim rectangular jewelry case, but it snugly houses (and hides) an included plastic seven-day pill holder (yes, with SMTWTFS). Covered in cheerfully patterned cotton canvas with a perky pink lining, the flip-open top has a magnetic closure that keeps pills secure inside. \nThe 6-inch-long Style Rx Pill Box comes in two patterns â€” a fireworks-like lime, pink and white design, and a navy and white flower motif. The seven-day pill insert is removable, so you can switch out a depleted one with a fully stocked replacement (sold separately).
