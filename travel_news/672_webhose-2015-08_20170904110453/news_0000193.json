It has lots of churches, a bunch of pubs, bright red Royal Mail post boxes, and a Marks and Spencer's. \nThere's not a whole heap to do and the shopping opportunities are dismal. \nBut it has a point of difference that will spark the World Cup pilgrimage: The town is called Rugby. \nIt was there, in 1823, that a young William Webb Ellis ignored the traditions of football, took the ball in his hands, and ran down a Rugby School field. \nA plaque commemorating William Webb Ellis at Rugby School.

Ad Feedback \nBut for true fans, the crucial stop is about a block further up the road, at Rugby School itself. \nThe exclusive private school, well known within England, runs year-round tours and has launched a new one specifically for the World Cup. \nRugby School archivist Rusty MacLean, clearly the go-to expert for everything Rugby, says the tours have become increasingly popular, so much so that he no longer runs them and a crew of local guides have been trained. \nThe tour takes in the field where Webb Ellis made history, and a school museum with rugby relics, including a crimson cap that is believed to be part of the original uniforms and the item behind the term 'international cap'. \nThere are a host of bizarre rugby facts on offer, including that a try was not originally the points-scoring achievement it is now. Rather, when the player got the ball down over the line he simply got a 'try' at kicking a goal. \nPictures from more than a century ago depict games that could apparently go on for days and in which hundreds of people would participate. \nA statue of William Webb Ellis near Rugby's town centre.
