It is fighting for a share of the burgeoning tourism market in China, which is the largest source of overseas tourist spending in the world. More Carmakers agree €2.8bn Nokia Here deal \nThe company said that one of the reasons it raised money was to expand abroad, to cater to Chinese tourists in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Hong Kong. \nTujia has partnered with US vacation rental site HomeAway , which is also an investor, for help building out its offerings overseas. In addition to listing properties on its website — which it expects to number 400m-500m by year-end — it is also a property manager. \nRecent investors in the start-up also include Ctrip.com International, LightSpeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital. \nDespite the turmoil that has enveloped mainland stock markets in the past few months, Tujia managed to ride a wave of investment into so-called online to offline services, which have taken the internet by storm in China. \nThese successes include Didi Kuaidi, the car-hailing app backed by internet groups Alibaba and Tencent that was valued at $12bn-$15bn in a capital raising in July; Meituan, a Groupon-like site that raised $700m in January at what it says was a valuation of $7bn; and Dianping, a restaurant reviews site that raised $850m at a valuation of $4bn. \nSuch sites, which marry offline sectors with online marketing, payment, and logistics, have become the fastest growing parts of China’s internet economy. \nAlibaba and Baidu , two of China’s largest internet conglomerates, each announced multibillion dollar investments into online to offline commerce last month. \nIt emerged in June that Airbnb itself was on the verge of completing a $1.5bn funding round that would boost its valuation to $24bn, part of efforts by the US-based group to tap into booming demand in Asia \nThe investors in the latest Tujia funding round, which was led by Hong Kong-based All Stars Investment, said they were attracted by the prospects of the so called “sharing economy”, in which owners rent out something they are not using such as a car or a property. \n“The sharing economy is going to be a major trend in China because overcapacity is such a problem in the economy. Sharing can help absorb vacancies and underutilised capacity,” said Richard Ji, co-founder of All Stars Investment. \nIn 2013 China became the largest source of foreign tourism revenues in the world, according to the UN World Tourism Organisation.
