Photo by John Fischer, licensed to About.com \nHawaii's culture, customs, traditions and aloha spirit will be showcased and celebrated in one of Hawaii's most-prominent events, the Aloha Festivals , now in its 69th year. This Year's Theme \nThe mission of the Aloha Festivals is to preserve and perpetuate Hawaiian culture and to celebrate the diverse customs, traditions and aloha spirit of Hawaii. This year's Festival theme is “Hulu Aloha – Beloved Feather Treasures.” \nThe annual theme is chosen carefully and this year's theme commemorates the timeless art form of intricate featherwork and the dedication to create such masterpieces, with special emphasis on the masterworks of the late Mary Lou Kekuewa and her daughter Paulette Kahalepuna. \nThe Hawaiian culture has long incorporated intricate featherwork into its symbols and traditions. \nHere is how the festival organizers explain their choice of this year's theme. \nThe kahili (feather standard for Hawaiian royalty), ‘ahu`ula (cloak), mahiole (helmet), and lei are treasured works of art that distinguished the Ali`i (ruling class) of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Now held in high regard because of their history and ceremonial significance, featherwork and other symbols of rank are worn each year by the Aloha Festivals Royal Court to perpetuate the pageantry and magnificence of the Ali‘i. \nFeatherwork techniques differed among groups throughout Polynesia, practiced by Tahitians, Maoris and Hawaiians. However, the refined skills and techniques that exemplify the Hawaiian hulu, elevated these artifacts and their craftsmanship to a revered status throughout the Pacific and with collectors around the world. \nHawaii's leading featherwork artist, Mary Lou Kekuewa was named a “Living Treasure” by the Honpa Hongwanji in 2003 for her mastery and perpetuation of the art of feather lei and kahili. She and her daughter Paulette Kahalepuna also were honored by the Historic Hawaii Foundation and the Native Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce and worked with the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and the Bishop Museum. History of the Aloha Festivals \nWhat is known today as Aloha Festivals was created in 1946 as Aloha Week, a cultural celebration of Hawaii's music, dance and history, intended to preserve the unique traditions of Hawaii. \nIt took a year to plan the first Aloha Festivals, and in the fall of 1947 the festivities began. Since then, the celebration has expanded to include over 300 events on six Hawaiian Islands over a two-month period. In 1991 the name of the celebration was changed to Aloha Festivals. \nThe Festivals now encompass all of the many and varied cultures of the people of Hawaii, be they Hawaiian, Japanese, Filipino or any other races that call Hawaii their home. \nEach year, nearly 30,000 volunteers participate in the staging of the events, which are attended by nearly one million people, in what has been called \"a festival truly of the people of Hawaii by the people of Hawaii.\" \nFall was chosen for the Aloha Festivals for two primary reasons; first to honor the makahiki, the ancient Hawaiian time of music, dance and feasting when war was not permitted, and second to attract visitors to the islands after the summer rush. Today, the celebration has become an island tradition. \nThe festivals are funded through appropriated funds from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, corporate sponsorships and private donations, as well as through the sale of Aloha Festivals power bands, ribbons and merchandise. \nThis year’s Aloha Festivals takes place from Sept. 5 to 26 at various locations on Oahu, sharing the history and traditions of Hawaii and the unique spirit of aloha with both kama`aina (local residents) and malihini (visitors). Schedule of Aloha Festivals Events: \nAll events are free and open to the public. They are supported by the sale of Aloha Festivals ribbons and merchandise from participating retailers. Aloha Festivals merchandise will also be sold at all events. \nSaturday, September 5, 2015 \nAloha Festivals Royal Court Investiture & Opening Ceremony, 2:00 to 4:00 p.m., \nInvestiture – Royal Hawaiian Hotel, Coconut Grove \nOpening Ceremony – Royal Grove within the Royal Hawaiian Center \nThe Ali‘i – king, queen, prince and princess – take their places in the 2015 Aloha Festivals Royal Court.
