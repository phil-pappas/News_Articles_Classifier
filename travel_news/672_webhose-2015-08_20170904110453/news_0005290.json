They are also encouraged to adopt innovative technology solutions to up their game.” \n\nSentosa Development Corporation and Robinsons are two businesses that are looking at utilising the ESF. \n\nSusan Ang, divisional director, island investment and branding at Sentosa Development Corporation said that the scheme “will be helpful to our many partners on the island as they would have the opportunity to tap on this funding to enhance their offerings and ultimately, create a more dynamic and memorable experience for all our visitors\". \n\nRobinsons, meanwhile, is hoping to utilise the new fund by establishing a heritage gallery at their flagship store at The Heeren shopping mall, commented Christophe Cann, group managing director, Robinsons. \n\nSTB is now calling out to Singapore registered business to submit their tour development and technology initiatives proposals from now until February 5, 2016. \n\nEvaluation sessions for proposals will be held in October and December this year, and February next year. Applications are to reach STB by the 5th of the month of the evaluation cycle. \n\nMore details will be shared at the STB’s industry briefing session on September 4.
