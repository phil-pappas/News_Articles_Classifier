Celebrating the ‘Best in Lancashire’, 21 trophies were presented with the Barton Grange Hotel beating off stiff competition in the hospitality sector to take home the Hotel of the Year award. \n‘We are thrilled’ commented the hotel’s general manager Daniel Rich ‘The team has worked really hard all year to deliver the highest standards of Lancashire hospitality, whist undergoing a refurbishment of guestrooms and meeting spaces. We have lots more hotel developments and additional refurbishment planned for later this year too, so this award is really a testament to the team’s ongoing dedication and passion for being the best Hotel in Lancashire!’ Frank McKenna, chief executive at Downtown in Business, said: ‘Congratulations to all the winners and nominees who attended the awards last night. It’s fantastic to celebrate the hard working companies in Lancashire each year and see the level of support they have for each other. ‘This year’s LBA has had a great response and is very popular with Lancashire businesses, something we are very proud of here are at Downtown.'
