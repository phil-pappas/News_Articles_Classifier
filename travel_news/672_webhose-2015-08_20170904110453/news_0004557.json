Why? Because Brussels is the second-most boring city in Europe, she said, but she lived in the first.\nWarsaw gets a bad rap, even from the natives. (Sound familiar, Philadelphia?)\nAfter that dinner in Belgium, I resolved to go and see about the city in Poland for myself - which I did, last year with my 19-year-old son.\nIt didn't start well. We connected through London's Heathrow, and upon arriving in Warsaw, my son Sam said, \"But we were just in London.\"\nMore coverage Personal Journey: The many rewards of party crashing in the Galapagos Personal Journey: Enroute to the sea, a wrong turn up mountain Personal Journey: Dropping in on the Andes in Ecuador So?\n\"So? That's like flying to Philadelphia and then continuing on to Harrisburg.\"\nBut I found Warsaw fascinating.\nThe Nazis destroyed it. Methodically and utterly, practically brick by brick - something like 95 percent of everything. Before the war, 1.4 million people lived there; 1,000 remained after.\nThen, remarkably, the Soviets, who sat across the Vistula River and watched the destruction, occasionally shooting at Allied planes, recreated the city. They didn't just rebuild it - they recreated it, practically brick by brick.\nThis destruction and rebuilding became the theme of our visit, forming the narrative for practically everything we saw.\nOur first stop was the Royal Castle, where the audio tour told the story of its meticulous recreation. Our favorite museum was that of the Warsaw Uprising. Working through its often-loud multimedia exhibits gave us a good sense of the enormous extent of Hitler's retribution.\nYet all of the massive destruction now seems neatly contained in monuments and museums. The Old Town and contiguous New Town look like standard-issue beautiful Baltic-state city centers. So meticulous was the rebuilding - now a half-century old - that it had no air of reconstruction. In Market Square, they even built buildings on a slight lean to simulate the settling of centuries.\nThe only original stuff seemed to be subterranean, out of the bombs' reach.\nAt the Historical Museum, our guide took us on a tour of the basement.\n\"See those bricks?\" he said with something like hushed awe. \"They're from the 1600s.\" In other parts of Europe, that could be considered a renovation.\nAfter we walked the Path of Remembrance through the former Jewish Ghetto, we visited the Pawiak, a prison in which the Nazis executed more than 30,000 before blowing it up. Today you can see a few underground cells and a leafless Monument Tree, which itself died a decade ago, to be replaced with a bronze replica.\nNot everything was recreated. The Soviets seem to have left more of a permanent visual mark than the Nazis, from the spectacularly unattractive Palace of Culture and Science to the depressingly bleak National Museum to the rows of block housing that now dominate the former ghetto.\nMy son came around on Warsaw, and not only because he could eat his weight in pierogies two or three times a day. Warsaw today is beautiful, compact and mostly walkable, and has an engaging story to tell. In our four-day stay, we never wanted for something to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T10:49:28.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
