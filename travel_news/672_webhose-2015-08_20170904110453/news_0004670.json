If you don’t take first place today, I’ll be surprised.’\nFinally, it seems, there’s a sport where my weakness for beer and pizza offers a competitive advantage. The bigger you are, the faster you’re likely to go down the Comet bobsled run in Park City, Utah.\nIn the baking summer heat, there have been a few modifications to the bobs that thunder down the 2002 Winter Olympics course.\nThe Utah Olympic Park track covers 4,400ft in length, with a 400ft drop in elevation and 15 curves\nWheels have been fitted to the bottom, the controls have been modified so the pilot can steer and brake, and padding has been introduced for the benefit of ordinary Joes willing to throw themselves down the track at up to 70mph.\nThat track, however, is something of a monster. Covering 4,400ft in length, with a 400ft drop in elevation and 15 curves for them to clatter around, riders are subjected to forces that are four-and-a-half times stronger than gravity.\n Glories of secret Britain: 20 enchanting gardens you MUST...

Instructions for survival amount to little more than trusting the pilot, sitting with your legs either side of the person in front, wrapping your hands around the loops inside, and keeping your back straight.\nI, however, have one extra piece of instruction. As I’ll be in the second seat, directly being the pilot, I have the key task of not smashing Brent in the back of the head with my clunking great safety helmet.\nWe’re the 16th team of the day to take on the run, and the current best time is 59.10 seconds. Breaking records is not the primary concern as eager volunteers give us the push to send us hurtling downhill, however.\nRide of your life: Have your own go at bobsledding at Utah Olympic park for under £50\nThe Jamaican bobsled team have their own theme song We pick up speed very quickly, with the wheels creating a roaring sound as the bob flies into action.\nAny thoughts of taking a peek at the mountain surroundings on the way down are quickly extinguished – it’s all way too fast for anything other than burying heads in shrugged shoulders and hoping for the best.\nAs we hit the curves, the G-forces slam in. Suddenly the instructions about keeping a straight back seem impossible. Every instinct screams at me to dive into the brace position. Only the fear of clashing heads with Brent stops me.\nThe bends seem to bank more steeply and it’s so fast it’s not even possible to feel sick – everything’s pressured inwards. I’m sure Brent’s doing some noble work at the front, but it feels as if we’re all powerless to do anything but hang on.\nEven stopping is in the hands of the track – it has an uphill slope at the end. But as we cross the finish, we’ve decelerated enough to see the time – 58.62 seconds. The fat boys have taken first place.\nTRAVEL FACTS: Plan your own bobsled adventure Summer bobsled at Utah Olympic Park costs $75 (£48).
