This year’s 30th edition of Festival Kreol is dedicating the month of October as the Creole month, with the main events starting on October 24, the day the Kreol Festival will be officially opened. Conceived by Telly’s Modelling agency, Miss Creole des iles International is open for young ladies aged 18-30 years and natives of a Creole-speaking Island. \nThe pageant is set to create a platform for young people to promote Creole culture, dance, food, and folklore, as well as tourism-culture activities in Creole-speaking countries. Since the launching of the pageant earlier this month, five candidates have already shown interest. The target is to achieve a maximum of ten ladies who will contest in the grand finale. Telly’s Modelling agency said the pageant on October 10 will be a soft-launching of Miss Creole des Iles International. \nWhile the secretariat of Miss Creole des iles International will be based in Seychelles, Telly’s Modelling agency is anticipating that each Creole-speaking country will organize their Miss Creole pageant on a national level with the winners meeting in Seychelles for the Grand Final of Miss Creole des Iles International. There is also plan to rotate the organization of Miss Creole des Iles International among Creole-speaking countries. Executive Producer of Telly’s agency, Terry Carolla, said, “Our aim is to make the pageant a renowned international one which will attract potential, international media for broadcasting around the world, thus creating another cultural tourism attraction for the Seychelles, and most importantly to provide a platform for the develop of our young ladies, building their self-confidence and self-esteem.” \nTelly’s Modelling agency said the reigning Miss Creole des iles International will work with the secretariat to implement an educational program in their respective countries to bring to the fore the full spectrum of Creole tradition, such as music and language, and become an ambassador for culture and tourism among the younger generation. \nSeychelles has ventured into the Miss Creole pageant in the past when it was held in 1994, 1996, and 2010; this pageant had left interesting chapters in the organization of this event. With Creole des iles International, Telly’s agency looks to bring this event to new heights and give it an international status. \nThe closing date for registration of Miss Creole des iles is August 30, 2015. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
