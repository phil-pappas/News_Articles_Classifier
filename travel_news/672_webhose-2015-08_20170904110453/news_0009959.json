The visa exemption process will come into effect from October 1.\nTourism and Culture Minister Mohamed Nazri Aziz announced in June that the Cabinet had agreed to grant the visa-free facility to group tourists from the China effective Sept 1, but it has now been postponed to Oct 1.\nThe approved entry points are at KLIA and KLIA2 as well as airports in Penang, Senai, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu and Langkawi.\nTourism Malaysia chairman Wee Choo Keong in a statement said the Home Ministry had finally agreed to the move on Wednesday.\nWee said temporary social pass holders will not be allowed to apply for other permits or passes and the pass will only be granted for those traveling on a direct flight from China to Malaysia. The tourists must also have a return flight ticket.\nThe applicants for the temporary social pass must provide proof in the forms of cash, credit card, ATM with the logo UnionPay and place of residence at the time of arrival.\n“In the event that any tourist under this category fails to return or violates any conditions or regulations set by the ministry, the tour operator will be fined RM1,500 per tourist.\n“In addition, any tour operator that violates the above conditions three times or more will be blacklisted and not permitted to bring in any more tourists from China,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:54:44.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
