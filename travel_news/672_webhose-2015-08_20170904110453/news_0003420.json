Innovation and new technology are key drivers in creating urban hubs that foster new businesses and play a pivotal role in moving the economy forward. With an increasingly urbanised society, Britain’s city leaders are major stakeholders in developing a highly interconnected and dynamic environment for business success. The event will be chaired by Allister Heath, deputy editor of The Telegraph. Renowned industry leaders, as well as members of the award-winning Telegraph editorial team, will facilitate the discussion about smart cities between panellists, incorporating questions from attendees. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson will be giving a speech to close the conference. We need to work harder than ever to stay ahead of the game and to do so we need to harness the huge potential that new technology offers us Other confirmed speakers include Sir Howard Bernstein, chief executive, Manchester City Council; Steve Turner, head of Future Cities, Manchester City Council; Steve Hilton, Connecting Bristol, Bristol City Council; Geoff Snelson, director of Strategy, Milton Keynes Council; and Professor Enrico Motta, professor of Knowledge Technologies, Open University.

I am looking forward to hearing some of the best informed speakers on these subjects at what should be a lively and informative event.” The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: “In a rapidly changing world we need to work harder than ever to stay ahead of the game and to do so we need to harness the huge potential that new technology offers us. Britain's Smart Cities will be an excellent opportunity for city leaders to discuss the very latest developments in creating cities for the future, and I look forward to taking part.” John Holland-Kaye, chief executive, Heathrow – the conference’s gold sponsor, said: “Heathrow is like a small city, and with expansion, we can make it a smart and sustainable city, at the heart of an integrated transport system. We look forward to working with the Telegraph’s Britain’s Smart Cities conference to turn this vision into reality.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T16:28:55.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
