The number of guests from Gulf countries has been constantly increasing. Our country never planned or plans to reduce the number of visas issued to our guests from the Kingdom any other Gulf country or from any other part of the world. Our tourism and spa industry is dedicated to making guests from all over the world feel comfortable. \n\nThe Czech Republic has a long tradition in tourism and hospitality. And in a bid to further promote tourism the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic and the Embassy in Riyadh have substantially increased the number of consular staff and diplomats and extended working hours of the consular section. We plan to open two outsourcing visa offices in Riyadh and Jeddah with the cooperation of Saudi tourist agencies in near future. Vladimir Lukastik Charge d'affaires a.i.
