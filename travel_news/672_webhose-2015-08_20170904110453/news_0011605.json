Irish authorities say most of the thefts occurred in central Dublin during the afternoon. (Tribune Newspapers) By Larry Habegger, Dani Burlison Chicago Tribune Theft Even in Ireland, watch your wallet \nIreland: The Irish Tourist Assistance Service reported that tourists were collectively robbed of $90,000 in 2014. Of the 726 tourists who fell victim to robbers and petty thieves, only eight were victims of violent crimes. Most of the incidents reportedly took place in the center of Dublin, between 2 and 6 p.m. This serves as a reminder to remain alert even in the seemingly most benign places. Ecuador: President Rafael Correa declared a state of emergency because of increasing seismic activity at the Cotopaxi volcano near Quito. The volcano's last major eruption was in 1877. Recent activity has shot ash 3 miles into the air, which then spread more than 30 miles from the mountain. Access... ( Larry Habegger, Dani Burlison ) \nIndia: Health officials reported that new cases of dengue fever in Delhi bring the August total to 477 this year, a massive jump in infections compared with recent years. At least two people have died from the illness. And in Odisha, in the southern region of the country, more than 3,000 cases of malaria have been reported, most of those cases in schoolchildren. The mosquito-borne viruses do not have vaccines â€” malaria can be avoided with the use of antimalarial medications. The best way to avoid contracting the diseases is to prevent mosquito bites through the use of insect repellents. 0 \nIsrael: Recent rocket launchings from Syria have led to warnings about visiting the northern part of the country, specifically the Upper Galilee area and the northern part of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The U.S. State Department noted that \"recent events underscore the importance of situational awareness,\" and tourists should defer travel until the situation stabilizes. \nNepal: At least nine people, including seven police officers, were killed during ethnic protests Monday and Tuesday. Eight were killed Monday in the town of Tikapur, 250 miles west of Kathmandu, during a protest by the Tharu ethnic group, and a ninth Tuesday in the town of Gaur, where the Madhesi group was demonstrating. The groups are angry over a draft constitution that they feel will leave them without adequate political voice in local affairs. Protests by other historically marginalized communities have erupted in other areas, and officials have increased security, calling in military troops to address the unrest when necessary. Tourists should follow local media sources for safety information and avoid large crowds, particularly while visiting the Kailali District. \nThailand: The Aug. 17 blast that left 20 people dead and 100 injured at the popular Erawan shrine prompted Thai police to ramp up security at several tourist spots in Bangkok, including adding personnel and sniffer dogs. Authorities have yet to arrest any suspects for the bombing, and it's too early to say if this was an isolated attack. Tourists should be aware of their surroundings at all times. \nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
