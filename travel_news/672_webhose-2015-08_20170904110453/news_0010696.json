The Grand Sale will continue for 79 days until October 31st 2015. This shopping-tourism festival is unlike the other shopping festivals in the world, which focus only on shopping. It aims to provide the foreign visitors a quality time in Korea in all aspects such as shopping, entertainment and tourism. The benefits include discounts on shopping, tourist attractions, accommodations, transportation, food, beverages and entertainment. The visitors can benefit from 70 per cent discounts for limited seats on all Jeju Air routes.

Phases of the moon, art, music festival When: September 17-20, 2015 Where: Arkansas, USA Phases of the Moon presents 100% organic, feel-good music f, as the tagline goes. That boils down to jam rock, bluegrass, funk and soul, all performed by musicians with instruments (no DJs and electronic tunes allowed). But the bands are just one ephase f of four that the festival incorporates: inspiring artwork, a sense of community and a conscious collective are the others. So it's a hippietrippy crowd that makes its way to Mulberry Mountain. Grizzled Deadheads, tie-dye-clad college students and dreadlocked parents with toddlers come from around the country to kick off their sandals and sway to the jam. Soon everyone becomes part of the Phaser family. The festival grounds stretch over a 3000-acre prairie park that provides room to run into all kinds of oddities: art installations of giant flowers to climb, a random drum circle, people dancing amid mega bubbles, fire twirlers and much more. Or head off on your own and hang out in a field with your banjo. Mahuli nature trek When: September 5-6, 2015 Where: Mahuli Tucked away in the foothills of the Mahuli range, on the border of Thane and Palghar districts, the location of this nature camp is ideal to enjoy the lush green forest in monsoon.
