Airlines on the list are barred from operating in European airspace due to either concerns about safety standards or the regulatory environment in their country of registration.\nTrigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Excluding this latest incident, it has written off 10 aircraft.\nIndonesia has a patchy aviation safety record and has seen two major plane crashes in the past year, including an AirAsia flight that went down in the Java Sea, killing all on board.\nThe AirAsia crash prompted the Indonesian government to introduce regulations aimed at improving safety.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T08:02:57.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
