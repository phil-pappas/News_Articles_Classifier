A record for Brussels Airport. Cargo volume at Brussels Airport saw a very distinct increase of 18% compared against July of last year. The full-cargo segment in particular saw an impressive increase.\nPassengers\nDuring the first month of the summer, Brussels Airport welcomed an average 80,000 passengers every day. Which is 5,000 more than in July of last year. This represents a 6.3% rise on July last year, which is in line with the growth seen at other European airports.\nThe number of originating passengers grew by 5% compared against July of last year. Brussels Airlines and the low cost airlines in particular are doing well, with other European airlines too recording positive results.\nThe number of transfer passengers saw a sharp 16.9% increase, which only serves to demonstrate the growing importance and the development of Brussels Airport as a hub in the global Star Alliance network.\nCargo\nCargo volumes at Brussels Airport were up by an impressive 18% on July of 2014. Brussels Airport has been recording significant growth for some months now, courtesy of the 4 new cargo airlines that started operating at the airport in the last twelve months, and is outperforming the rest of Europe, where figures are only slightly positive or even negative.\nThe full-cargo segment in particular is seeing an impressive 71.6% rise compared against July of last year, but the integrator segment too is continues to grow with a 5% increase.\nBelly cargo – the cargo carried on board passenger aircraft – was slightly down on July of last year, as the aircraft traditionally carry more passengers during the summer months, leaving less room for cargo.\nFlightsThe number of flights at Brussels Airport went up slightly by 2% compared against July\nlast year. The average load factor on passenger flights is continuing to rise, going from\n79% to close to 82%. This means the number of passengers per flight went up from 119\nin July of 2014 to 125 in July of this year.\nSource:- Brussels Airport", "external_links": ["http://www.brusselsairport.be/cf/res/img/results1507"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:13:12.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
