The 20-day trip aboard the National Geographic Orion, which can accommodate 102 passengers, departs Sept. 22 from Brisbane, Australia. The tour includes forays into largely inaccessible terrain where art, tribal life, biology and history intersect. The highlight is learning about the cultures of West Papua, Papua and Papua New Guinea and meeting Asmat, above, and Trobriand islanders.\nOutdoor pursuits include snorkeling, kayaking and exploring coral formations in glass-bottom Zodiacs.\nJoining the crew of naturalists are guest speakers: a National Geographic photographer, an undersea specialist, a dive master and the “Flags of Our Fathers” author James Bradley.\nRates per person, based on double occupancy, begin at $11,543.", "external_links": ["https://www.expeditions.com/destinations/borneo-indonesia/raja-trobriand/"], "published": "2015-08-18T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:42:00.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
