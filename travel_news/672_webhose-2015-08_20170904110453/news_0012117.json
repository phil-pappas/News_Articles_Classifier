Ong said she hopes that the shift from single-entry visas to multiple-entry versions can be completed for citizens of Vietnam and the Philippines in the near future. \n\nInbound tourism to Japan has also been boosted by increased flights by budget airlines such as AirAsia. The Malaysia-based carrier already flies to Tokyo and Osaka and will launch direct services to Sapporo in October. \n\n\"I also think that the Japanese travel sector has become more receptive to overseas visitors, such as catering for Muslim travellers by providing prayer rooms in airports and halal meals in hotels and restaurants,\" Ong said. \n\nOperators are similarly reporting increased interest in Japan as a destination. Halley Trujillo, senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, said: \"We feel there are a number of reasons behind the renewed interest in Japan as a destination, with Japanese TV shows appearing more in Europe and the US, while flights are also becoming more reasonable. \n\n\"We have also felt the benefit of the weaker yen and Qantas and Jetstar increasing flights to Japan for Australian travellers,\" Trujillo added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:53:53.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
