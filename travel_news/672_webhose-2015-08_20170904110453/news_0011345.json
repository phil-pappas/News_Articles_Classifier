The resort that brought gaming to Atlantic City continues to stay at the top of its game with a new conference center. \nFollowing the opening of the $35 million Jimmy Buffett-themed Margaritaville entertainment complex, which is part of a total of nearly $80 million spent on further expansion and renovation under Morris Bailey's ownership, Resorts continues to evolve and grow as a destination. \n“Resorts Casino Hotel is dedicated to ensuring that our leisure and business travelers are always offered the best that Atlantic City has to offer,” said Morris Bailey, owner of Resorts. “We are committed to continuing to reinvest in the property and to offer the finest in meeting space, lodging, gaming, dining and entertainment.” \nMark Giannantonio, president and CEO of Resorts Casino Hotel, spoke at a press conference today, acknowledging the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority’s approval of $9.4 million in funding from the Investment Alternative Taxes which allowed the conference center to be developed. He added, “The technical aspects of the new conference center are sure to impress meeting planners and guests.” \nGroup meeting attendees at Resorts can wirelessly connect laptops and personal media devices simultaneously, while sharing screens with each other and even with colleagues in remote locations. Convenient touch panel controls and built-in wireless microphones offer ease for presenters. \nOther highlights of the technology include full 1080P resolution on all screens and up to four devices can share the screen in QUAD view. Resorts installed higher resolution capabilities in anticipation of future needs, high capacity Wi-Fi, electrical and Telecom connectivity hidden in the floors, minimizing cables, and architectural LED lighting on dimmers with programmable pre-sets. Twelve breakout rooms keep productivity high with built-in 80” or 90” LED monitors, drop-down screens and cinema quality projection. Two theaters offer seating for 300 or 1,350 with state-of-the-art sound and light technology. \nIn addition to the 12 new meeting rooms, the showpiece of Resorts’ Conference Center is the Atlantic Ballroom with a multi-use pre-function area, with natural lighting. Four sets of operable walls divide the main conference hall into five potential spaces and allow groups to have an adaptable floor plan for a variety of uses. The new conference center brings the total offerings at Resorts to 24 meeting and function rooms with more than 64,000 square feet of usable space, most featuring natural light and ocean views. \nGiannantonio thanked members of the Resorts Conference Center project team, including architects and interior designers SOSH Architects, General Contractor TN Ward, Conspectus, Structural Engineers Conn Shaffer, Engineers Giovanetti Shulman Associates, and the audio visual technology specialists Judge Unified Communications, along with Palmieri Electric, Modernfold, Kisby Shore and The Lighting Practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:07:55.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
