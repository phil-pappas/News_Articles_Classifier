Read along... CUSTOMISED HOLIDAYS WITH UNIQUE PERSONALISED FLEXIBILITY Traditional cookie-cutter packaged tours no longer hold interest for today's Indian consumers. Today, travellers fancy a customised holiday with freedom to create their own tailor made itineraries specific to their interests, be it cuisine-culinary, art-architecture, culture-history or wildlife and adventure. - In the current season, the Indian travellers are increasingly preferring being on board in a wellequipped \"floating resort\" with a delightful array of entertainment options and numerous facilities. - Opting for itineraries that enable travellers to re-connect with their inner self â€” a spiritual refresh and rejuvenation package. - Sports tourism has been catching interest especially from affluent Indians (corporate, film moguls, HNI-UHNI etc) to witness their favourite global sports live by travelling to the host country. (Shibani Phadkar, Senior Vice President & Head - Leisure Travel Outbound, Thomas Cook (India) Ltd) LET'S GET MOBILE Indians now seek 2-3 short breaks in a year in addition to the one big family vacation. With an inclination to visit new and unexplored domestic and international destinations, it provides them with bragging rights within their peer group. The concept of staying over with families and friends on holidays also seems to be dwindling amongst Indians. They are more keen on staying in hotels and exploring other accommodation options available. Shopping interestingly has taken a back seat as the most preferred activity on vacation, and the interest in adventure activities has seen a remarkable rise. Lastly, the Indian traveller is very comfortable making travel bookings over the mobile, and we have seen our last minute hotel bookings via the mobile grow exponentially in the past one year. (Sharat Dhall, President, Yatra.com) HOTEL + HOSTEL = GREAT LOCAL FUN Emergence of Poshtels - These are a hybrid of the 'hostel' and the 'hotel', especially for the young and single travellers who are watching the pennies but still demand a stylised, glamourous hotel experience. Many hostels are upgrading their facilities and adapting modern and luxurious design with hightech facilities like, offering restaurants, twin en-suite rooms, free Wi-Fi and breakfast. These are accommodations competing with the boutique hotels. (Amit Agarwal, Senior Marketing Manager Hotels.com) OFF-SEASON TRAVEL IS AMAZING People are travelling during the off-season especially monsoons. The reason for this is the fantastic deals offered by higher-star hotels, especially resorts and five-star properties to boost occupancy in this season which is traditionally lean travel period. With airline flash sales also fuelling cheap travel during this period, monsoons are no longer frowned upon by travellers. This is in fact the best time to travel for those looking for relaxing natureoriented vacations. Kerala and Goa are at their lushest best, and the five-star properties and resorts offer attractive rates. Monsoon travel to Kerala went up by 20 per cent in 2014 over the previous year. Shillong, Cherrapunji, Udaipur and Mount Abu in Rajasthan are also in great demand during the monsoon season. People generally prefer destinations where rain is not non-stop. Also, a lot of people tend to book quality accommodation and enjoy activities within the resort itself, such as spa, ayurvedic treatments, fine dining, etc.\" (Ranjeet Oak, Chief Business Officer-Holidays, MakeMyTrip) As told to Nimisha Tiwari   Follow this section for latest news on Travel To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T16:13:20.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
