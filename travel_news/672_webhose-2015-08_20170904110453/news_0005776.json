Since the second half of 2014, due to sluggish domestic demand for tire, coupled with negative impact brought by anti-dumping and countervailing investigations launched by the United States , domestic sales and exports of tire have been suppressed, and the demand for tire mold has been declining. In 2014, the tire mold industry in China achieved the revenue of RMB4.22 billion , up 8.6% from the previous year, indicating a substantial decline in growth rate compared with a year-on-year rise of 29.07% in 2013.\nIn point of market supply, as of the end of 2014, there were around 100 tire mold manufacturers in China , including 30 ones or so each with annual revenue of RMB20 million or more from their prime operations and 2 listed ones (Himile Mechanical Science and Technology ( Shandong ) and Greatoo). Seven companies boasted capacity of more than 2,000 sets apiece. In 2014, tire mold output in China reached 29,594 sets, representing a year-on-year growth rate of 5.86%.\nRegarding competitive landscape, Himile has become the world's largest tire mold manufacturer with a global market share of 15% and a domestic market share of about 38.2%. In 2014, tire mold revenue was RMB1.6106 billion , up 52.37% from a year earlier, accounting for 89.75% of the company's total. In the first quarter of 2015, the company reported RMB463.7 million in revenue and RMB130.7 million in net income, growing by 49.09% and 39.75% year on year respectively.\nGreatoo was the country's second largest company in terms of tire mold revenue in 2014 with the figure arriving at RMB552.59 million , a year-on-year jump of 17.98%, making up 53.35% of total revenue. In the first quarter of 2015, the company posted revenue of RMB222.89 million and net income of RMB48.01 million , up 4.58% and 19.05% as compared with that in the same period of 2014.\nWhile continuously developing their main businesses, Himile and Greatoo have been actively in entering new fields to create new areas for profit growth. In Mar 2014 , Himile acquired assets (including land and factories) of Malaysia Matt Precision Machine (KUNSHAN) Co., Ltd., and invested RMB15 million to incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary- Himile Mechanical Science and Technology (Kunshan) Co., Ltd.; in 2013, Greatoo set up Robots Division and planned to build it into the fourth-largest business segment besides tire mold, vulcanizer, and precision machine tool. In Dec 2014 , the industrial robot automatic production line independently developed by Greatoo got officially applied in China Strategic Holdings Ltd.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
