I don’t foresee any jail sentence at all, I think it’s been blown out of proportion by social media and I think it’s been a deliberate ploy to ban all hunting,” he said.\n“It has probably changed my family’s life, my business, forever… We have had many, many death threats.”\nMinister Muchinguri put a political spin on Cecil’s death.\n“Palmer, being an American citizen, had a well-orchestrated agenda which would tarnish the image of Zimbabwe and further strain the relations between Zimbabwe and the United States,” she alleged.\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes on long-ruling President Robert Mugabe and members of his inner circle after 2002 elections which western observers said were rigged.\nA state department official in Washington confirmed an extradition treaty did exist between the countries.\nAbout 50,000 visitors — half of them from abroad — visit the Hwange park every year, and Cecil was a much-photographed star attraction.\nZimbabwe officials said Friday that Cecil’s head and pelt had been confiscated.\nPalmer’s dental practice in Minnesota has been the scene of protests against Cecil’s death, with crowds leaving stuffed toys of lions, tigers and monkeys outside the building.\nA sign reading “Rot in Hell” was plastered on the office door.\nOne animal rights charity called for Palmer to be hanged.\nU.S. authorities said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was investigating “the circumstances surrounding the killing of Cecil the lion.”\nEdward Grace, deputy chief of law enforcement at the agency, said all efforts to contact Palmer had so far been unsuccessful.", "external_links": ["http://www.zimparks.org/"], "published": "2015-08-01T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T16:41:06.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
