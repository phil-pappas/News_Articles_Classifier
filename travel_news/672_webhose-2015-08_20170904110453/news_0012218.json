Founded in 1978 when avid skiers Wes and Anne Goyer opened the door of their first designer ski shop in Dallas, St. Bernard Sports has been known for a tradition of style, adventure and focus on customer relationships for nearly 40 years.\nWhile the name may be new, president and CEO Wes Goyer says everything else remains the same, “For the past 37 years, we’ve built our business listening and responding to our customers. A name that is both contemporary and true to our roots is another example of our efforts to have strong connections to our customers.”\nSaint Bernard focuses on helping families enjoy adventure in the most stylish way possible while placing a strong emphasis on customer service. With three brick and mortar stores around the Austin/Dallas area and a booming online store, the one-time exclusive ski shop is poised to continue growth on an accelerated pace.\nThe new name stays true to the winter-sports roots, while recognizing the range of products that continue to be added each year in response to customer interests and needs. Saint Bernard now offers top designers for winter sports along with swim, hiking, activewear and sportswear.\n“It’s been an honor to work with my family and with other passionate employees at Saint Bernard to grow the business to the level at which we are today,” says Chief Operating Officer and second generation family employee Charlie Goyer. “We’re working hard all the time to improve; and we’re excited about our future.”\nThe Goyer and Saint Bernard family invite you to visit them and help celebrate their new name at any of their Texas locations in Inwood Village, Saint Bernard Outlet in The Shops at Park Lane in Dallas or the Saint Bernard in Austin in the 2nd Street District, or at their extensive online shop.\nAbout Saint Bernard:\nSaint Bernard is a family owned ski, snowboard and apparel retail shop and online store based in Dallas, Texas.
