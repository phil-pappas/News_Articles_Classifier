Having recreated areas with more than 200 native species of Sicilian plants and improved wetland areas to allow plant life to flourish around the resort – set in 230 hectares of breathtaking landscape overlooking the Mediterranean – attention has focused on improving the grass quality and teeing areas of its two 18-hole championship courses since the spring. The top contemporary sports and lifestyle destination – a Rocco Forte hotel – has completed a major conversion programme from rye grass to Bermuda grass on all 36 holes of the East and West courses to reduce the amount the amount of water used. In addition, a schedule of micro-coring has been carried out to further improve the putting surfaces on the greens while the resort’s team of greenkeepers will begin a six-month bunker reconstruction programme in November to improve drainage and playability ahead of next summer. David Waters, Head Golf Professional at Verdura Resort, said: “The beautiful, natural Sicilian setting is very much at the heart of what makes the Verdura golf experience so special, and it’s imperative that we continue to enhance and preserve every part of the course with our sustainability and renaturalisation programmes. “All our course maintenance programmes are designed to ensure that the beautiful surroundings are coupled with exceptional playing conditions – a combination that makes the golf courses at the resort some of the most enjoyable in Europe.” Designed by world-renowned architect Kyle Phillips, Verdura’s three links-style layouts have been built to the highest specifications with tee times arranged at 12-minute intervals to ensure free-flowing play, five sets of tees making the courses playable for golfers of all abilities and one of its courses dedicated daily to two-ball play only. Complementing its golf courses and nine-hole par-three course are extensive practice facilities including a double-ended driving range and excellent golf academy. Players can also take advantage of the latest state-of-the-art TaylorMade equipment when they hire clubs at the resort after a significant recent upgrade of its rental service. Prices start from €55 (approx £40) for a two-round package. Verdura, also a member of Leading Hotels of the World, has won widespread recognition across the luxury global travel industry since opening in 2009 with honours including a ‘Golden Award for Golf‘ at the 2015 Voyages & Hôtels Readers Awards and being named ‘Best Family European Golf Resort‘ by the 2011 Tatler Travel Guide. Situated on Sicily’s southern coast between Agrigento and the fishing city of Sciacca, an 80-minute drive from Trapani and Palermo airports, the resort features 203 rooms and suites – all with a sea view. Away from the fairways, guests can enjoy numerous other sports and leisure facilities including six tennis courts, a 60m two-tiered infinity pool, a 170sqm fully-equipped gym and an award-winning 4,000sqm spa complex.
