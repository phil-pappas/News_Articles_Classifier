Medical responders treated passengers after the plane landed, and no on was hospitalised, Beem said. \nExpressJet operates the flight for United Express. Beem said ExpressJet officials were trying to determine whether the plane could be fixed so the flight could continue to Chicago. If not, other accommodations would be made for the passengers, Beem said. \nInitial reports from Indianapolis International Airport indicated the flight had experienced a sharp, unexpected loss of altitude. Beem said that was incorrect and told NBCNews that it was \"standard procedure for planes to drop to a 10,000 foot altitude when there is a pressure issue on board.\" \nThe incident took place less than two days after a Salt Lake City-bound flight from Boston flew into a storm and was forced to make an emergency landing in Denver. Delta Airlines Flight 1889 landed safely at Denver International Airport after encountering lightning and hail so heavy the windshield on the Airbus A320 was cracked and nose cone damaged. \n\"This was the scariest 10 minutes of my life,\" passenger Robin Jones told KTSU-TV after arriving at the Salt Lake International Airport. \n\"I thought, 'OK. Have I told everybody that I love that I love them?' And as soon as I realised I had done that, I was like, 'I'm alright. Everything's going to be OK.'\" \nUSA Today", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T04:40:36.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
