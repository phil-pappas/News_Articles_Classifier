Erica’s appointment marks the final position to be appointed within the leadership team that will guide ICC Sydney to its December 2016 opening and ensure its successful ongoing operation. \nWith more than 14 years of experience in finance roles within the hospitality industry, Erica joins ICC Sydney after four years as the Regional Financial Controller for NSW and ACT with Accor and 16 years with the group. She is a Certified Practising Accountiant and holds a Bachelor of Business and an early career Diploma in Hotel Management. ICC Sydney CEO Geoff Donaghy said Erica’s appointment marked an important occasion for the ICC Sydney team. “We have handpicked a team of experts from business events, hospitality and related industries, building a supportive and dynamic culture that is driven for success. The leadership team that will implement ICC Sydney’s operational systems and drive us through a successful series of testing and commissioning events, culminating in the venue’s opening in December 2016, is now in place,” Mr Donaghy said. “This is the team tasked with opening what is undoubtedly the single most exciting project underway globally across the events industry today. It is also one of Sydney’s most prominent placemaking projects, delivering a contemporary, diverse and dynamic venue that the city and the world will be extremely proud to host and attend events within,” he said. The ICC Sydney team comprises experts from across Australia and abroad, underlining ICC Sydney’s world class positioning while accentuating the magnetism of Sydney as a global talent hub. Donaghy said the ability to compile a best-in-class team was down to three key factors; the prominence of ICC Sydney on the world stage, the strong and supportive culture set out by ICC Sydney’s management company, AEG Ogden, and the innate liveability and bright future for Sydney. “Participating in a city-shaping project that will deliver a legacy for Sydney is a rare and rewarding opportunity. The experience will stay with the team through their careers,” he said. When ICC Sydney opens in December 2016 it will employ more than 320 full time and up to 1,500 casual staff.
