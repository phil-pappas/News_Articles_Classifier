Developed by Sandip Jariwala, owner of the Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham in Alameda, Calif., HotelTap replaces notebooks, paper tickets, sticky notes, internal emails, spreadsheets, text messages and radios for recording and responding to guest requests, performing and tracking maintenance tasks, and resolving customer complaints. Using a social media network format, HotelTap leverages mobility and the cloud to share information between those who “need to know,” from department to department, employee to manager, and manager to owner, in one comprehensive location.\n“In my 20 years of operating hotels, I have always understood the importance of accurate and instant communication in helping me and my employees meet customer expectations,” Jariwala said. “I am an early adopter of technology and I am aware of the fast-paced changes in workplace communications. Using hand-written log books is no longer effective. Travelers have integrated mobile technology into their daily lives. In turn, they expect hoteliers to service their needs in the same logical manner. I knew I needed to leverage mobile technology and the cloud to run my hotel more efficiently; that meant dramatically changing the way we communicate at our property. That’s when I designed HotelTap — an at-a-glance digital log book that communicates a steady stream of daily activities and information in chronological order by department and by staff start time. If you use a social media network like Facebook or Twitter, you’ll love HotelTap. It closely resembles enterprise social software such as Yammer and Chatter and project-management tools like Basecamp or Asana.”\nHotelTap solves problems with:\n· Decrease in staff productivity due to inaccurate or missed communications\n· Translation problems between front desk and foreign-language speaking employees\n· Dropped guest requests and department tasks\n· Loss of revenue due to the absence of a Waitlist\n· Refunds to guests for complaints due to lack of preventive maintenance\n· Expensive equipment repairs and vendor charges\n· Owners and managers not receiving alerts in a timely manner\n· Negative online reviews due to absence of analytics for complaints and maintenance problems\n· Paper records occupying valuable storage space\nHere’s how it works:\nRather than requiring hotel staff to click through a series of tabs or buttons, HotelTap uses a steady messaging stream of interactive notes and tasks that are relevant to each department and staff member. For example, a front desk agent will log into HotelTap and see only the information or incomplete tasks that he or she needs to address during the shift. Any information relevant to the front desk — or tasks that need performed during the shift — is presented to the agent upon log in. Staff only see the communication stream relevant to their department, while managers and owners have access to all hotel correspondence.\nSource:-Hotel Tap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:10:27.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
