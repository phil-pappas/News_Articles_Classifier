Highlighting The Brewery’s catering offer, 70 guests including from Shell, Barclays, Unliever and EMAP enjoyed al fresco dining within The Brewery’s summer courtyard marquee. \nTransformed into an overgrown secret garden, the structure was decked with floral designs by Hybrid Flowers to create a mysterious and luxurious feel. Food director Tom Gore, executive chef Steve Connell and new head chef Fernando Granzotto designed a seasonal taster menu which featured Clouds of Tomato; Mackerel with chickpeas and rhubarb; Ways of Pea - Pea mousse, pea purée, pea sorbet and pea shoots; Seared scallop with vanilla emulsion; Soda bread with whipped butter; Seared lamb with heritage tomatoes and goats curd; Coconut parfait, pineapple sorbet, spit roast pineapple, maple, toasted coconut, lime curd and meringue nibs. Wines were matched to each dish, with Champagne on arrival and post-dinner espresso martinis served instead of coffee. A temporary kitchen was built in the octagon reception and dishes transported across the courtyard. Simon Lockwood, creative director at The Brewery commented on the event’s success: “We’re fortunate as a venue to have such unique and diverse spaces, we are able to create individual landscapes and settings for numerous events. Last night was another unique production and catered event, these occasions allow us to showcase the great and good of events at The Brewery, and highlights what sets us apart from other venues.” Tom Gore, The Brewery’s food director added: “I love creating new and exciting menus, whether it’s for a conference, one-off party or tasting event like last night, we have to work on our feet and be creative from one event to the next. This breed’s creativity, which the team at The Brewery has in abundance. We offer everything on-site for events and our fine-dining, seasonal, food combinations perfectly reflects The Brewery’s philosophies of quality, diversity and experience.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:11:29.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
