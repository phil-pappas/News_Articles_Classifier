However, the new beer drinkers, who are a likely to be female as male, are shunning milds, bitters and international lagers, instead they are drinking quirky styles from all over the world. Saisons, sours and heavily hopped IPAs are the order of the day. So read on, if you want to talk and drink like a Hackney hipster. Saison Originally a Belgian beer style, these are refreshing, bubbling, thirst quenchers, which are full of zesty flavours. The style derives from farmhouse breweries in Wallonia, and North West France. These are the ultimate artisanal beers, which were originally brewed during winter months for drinking on hot summer days. The long storage often give the beers wild yeasty flavours which adds to their hoppy and spicy complexity. Every farm would have its own variation but expect the beer to be yellow and cloudy, though darker and clear is equally acceptable. Now brewed worldwide and all year round, there are seemingly few rules. Beavertown’s latest saison is infused with oranges, strawberries, cucumber and mint. Maine-based Oxbow Brewing is offering a beer brewed with live lobsters and a dash of sea salt.Copyright: AP Wood aged Ageing beer in wood isn’t new. After all, it’s what was used to ferment, age, and transport beer before there was anything better, such as stainless steel. However, a new wave of brewers are discovering that storing beer in a wooden barrel is a way of adding swathes of flavours. Oak barrels add all sorts of interesting tastes such as burnt toast, vanilla and caramel. And if the barrel has been previously used for storing a spirit or a wine then expect to find signature notes of that drink. The practice of putting beer into a former spirit barrel was known as grogging. It was frowned on by the taxman as it was seen as a sneaky way of adding extra alcohol, without paying the excise on it. • Why beer is a better drink to serve with food than wine Sour beer Sour beers are thirst-quenching and alluring, drawing their heritage from some of Europe’s oldest beer styles such as Berlinner Weiss, Leipziger Gose and Belgium’s glorious Lambics. They usually get their distinctive palate, puckering tartness and sourness from Brettanomyces, a semi wild yeast and bacteria, which most brewers try and keep out of their beers. Craft beer aficionados often talk about beer having a Brett character. Expect to find earthy, farmhouse flavours, vinegar acidity and even a yoghurt tang. To the uninitiated they can be off putting and unpalatable, but it is a style that deserves to be given time. Think of plump red Bordeaux wines stored in oak barrels which soar with alluring tannin flavours. Many new beer fans are drinking a range of different types of beer. Copyright: ALAMY London murky London might have been famed for its foggy pea-soupers, but it is now becoming known for its cloudy beers, so much so that they’ve been dubbed London murkys. The time was when most people would expect a beer to be sparkling and crystal-clear with a tight white head. Not so nowadays, with many of the new wave of craft brewers who prefer their beer to be unfiltered and unfined. This means the beers are often opaque on a scale from a little bit hazy to very cloudy orange. Leading proponents include London brewers The Kernel and Brew by Numbers. On the continent drinkers of Belgian and Bavarian wheat beers wouldn’t bat an eyelid if their beers were far from clear, indeed that’s how they’d like it to be. •10 of the best sour beers in the UK Pasteurisation We have Louis Pasteur to thank for the practice of heating beers to kill off the yeast and other micro-organisms, which could turn a good pint into vinegar. Back in 1860s the French biochemist discovered that a living organism, called yeast, would turn a sugary liquid into alcohol, as part of its life cycle. Before it was thought of as purely a chemical process. But beer, because of its low alcohol strength, compared to wine or spirits is prone to bacterial infection and Pasteur’s other great contribution to brewing science was that heating the beer would stop it going off.However, detractors say pasteurisation kills not just the bugs but the flavour. Real ale A term coined by the founders of the Campaign for Real Ale , when it was founded in 1971 to denote cask conditioned beer. Unpasteurised, the living beer is packaged in a barrel together with some yeast. This enables a second, fermentation of the beer to take place in a pub’s cellar. The fermentation produces carbon dioxide which will add a sparkle and vitality to a beer, when it is poured. A beer in good condition should naturally release bubbles. •Britain's best real ale pubs Supporters say it produces beers which are fresh, natural and full of flavour and character. Once put on sale, ideal a cask should be sold within 72 hours. The fermentation of real ale produces carbon dioxide which will add a sparkle and vitality to a beer, Copyright: ALAMY Canned beer Canned beer came to the UK since the 1930s when Welsh brewer Felinfoel stole a march on its competition by being the first in the country to can one of its beers. The idea didn’t really take off until the 1960s, when the mass producers of beer started to put beer into cheap and cheerful cans which were stacked high and sold cheap in supermarkets. Now several craft brewers, such as Camden and Fourpure, are putting beer into cans saying they provide complete protection from light and oxygen, a fresh beer’s biggest enemies. Cans are also highly portable, welcome in places bottles are not, and are easily and infinitely recyclable. •The patriotic pint: 10 best beers made with British hops US style, India pale ale Originally an English pale ale, the style has been reinvigorated and reinvented by the American craft beer movement. US variations are often identified by being highly bittered through the massive use of citrus, floral flavoured hops such as Cascade or Citra which is balanced with chewy, juicy malt flavours. Often the signature beers of craft brewers worldwide they are frequently strong - over 8% alcohol by volume (ABV) is not unusual. English pale ale is often quite strong. Copyright: ALAMY Wheat Most self respecting craft brewers produce a wheat beer. German variations are made with a mixture of a minimum 40 per cent wheat mixed with barley malt. Unfiltered types are called hefewiss or hefewizen, typically they will look turbid and orange. Filtered versions are called kristal. Belgian and Dutch variants, don’t usually use as much wheat, are known as witte or bieres blanche, and are usually made with spices such as coriander and orange peel. In some the yeast will give flavours of banana, clove and bubble gum. •Could a daily beer be the key to a long and healthy life? Imperial stout In a world of big bold tastes imperials are the biggest and boldest. These are giants of the beer world and they have often been aged in wood for extra flavours. The colour varies from dark copper to black. High in alcohol, they are rich and malty can have flavours of dark fruits, leather and tobacco. Usually more than 8% ABV, they are strong enough to keep for years, the complexity of the beer changes from year to year. Drinking one is never predictable but it is rarely disappointing. Guiness is an example of stout: rich and malty. Copyright: ALAMY Craft beer Most people know what a craft beer is, but that doesn’t mean the term is easy to define. Cynics might say the term is no more than a marketing term, but it usually implies beer produced on a relatively small scale using quality raw materials. Craft beer proponents say it is a grass roots, consumer definition of the beers they want to drink. It has nothing to do with breweries marketing departments, self-describing their beers as craft. Craft beers are the beer world’s equivalent of rock and roll or jazz. In the music world Simon Cowell is pop, and a pop equivalent of a beer could never be craft. •Craft beer: the top 10 beers to try telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:01:07.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
