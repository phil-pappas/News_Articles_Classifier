Fall is also the ideal time to visit county fairs, go mountain biking or river rafting, and hit the galleries and shops now that the summer crowds are gone. Here are five drives to satisfy any foliage lover, with each itinerary offering spectacular scenery, extraordinary activities and ever-changing views.\nRangeley Lakes National Scenic Byway\nRangeley Lakes is a remarkably beautiful and pristine area of wilderness lakes and mountains, and this drive follows Routes 17 and 4, close to the Appalachian Trail and through a landscape of rolling hills and mountains. The dramatic Height of Land on Route 17 is the centerpiece of this scenic excursion, offering breathtaking views of Mooselookmeguntic and Upper Richardson Lakes. Scenery aside, this is prime time for fly fishing in the region, and the rich sporting heritage of the Rangeley Lakes Region, from artifacts of early rusticators to flies tied by the legendary “Fly Rod” Crosby, is on display at the Rangeley Outdoor Sporting Heritage Museum in Oquossoc.Midcoast Ramble\nThis drive starts in coastal Brunswick and heads Downeast along Route 1. There are countless possibilities for detours down the “fingers” of coastline. One takes visitors to Boothbay Harbor, where the 4th annual Claw Down on September 17 will attract 19 stellar Maine chefs to a friendly lobster bites competition.\nOr, head down to bucolic Pemaquid Point and its famous lighthouse. Visitors can amble down the back roads past saltwater farms to the scenic harbor at Friendship or to Wyeth country in Cushing. Back on Route 1, it’s time to carry on through toRockland, where the full range of the artistic genius of the Wyeth family can be seen at the Wyeth Center at the Farnsworth Museum. Finish the drive in Camden, and ascend to the 800-foot summit of Mount Battie, where spectacular views are enhanced by the foliage that runs right down to the harbor.\nSource:-Visit Maine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:44:50.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
