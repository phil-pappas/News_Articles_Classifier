Each year, MBA Orlando — Central Florida’s LGBT Chamber of Commerce — celebrates LGBT and allied businesses and community leaders who promote diversity and business equality and go above and beyond for the LGBT community.\n“Diversity and inclusion are at the core of our Wyndham Worldwide culture, and it is an honor to receive this award from MBA Orlando,” said Sarah King, executive vice president of human resources at Wyndham Vacation Ownership (WVO). “At Wyndham, we fully engage our diverse group of associates and leverage our differences to enhance our business, creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and appreciation. Our associates are also extremely passionate about giving back to our local communities — whether it’s by fundraising or volunteering their time — and we are proud to support philanthropic organizations through community partnerships.”\nWith more than 700 members in Central Florida, Wyndham Vacation Ownership’s associate business group for associates in the LGBT community and their straight allies, WYNPride, provides associates with a forum to share their insight with each other and leadership. In 2014, WYNPride members held various events benefiting the local community, including raising money for the AIDS Walk Orlando and volunteering at the Zebra Coalition®, a network of organizations that provide services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and all youth (LGBT+) ages 13-24. The Coalition assists young people facing homelessness, bullying, physical, sexual and drug abuse, and isolation from their families with individualized programs to guide them to recovery and stability.\nIn addition, Wyndham Worldwide has received a perfect 100-percent score three years in a row on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) and recognized as one of the “Best Places to Work for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LBGT) Equality.” Wyndham Worldwide was also recently recognized among the DiversityInc. Top 50 Companies for Diversity for the third year in a row.\nSource:- Wyndham Worldwide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:03:31.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
