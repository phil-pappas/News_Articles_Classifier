These secret adventures offer guests a chance to engage all of their senses of sights, sounds and flavours, with a tantalising element of surprise.\nFour Seasons Undercover at Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach will include at least four distinct dining and entertainment experiences never before offered to guests, led by Executive Chef Tory Martindale and Executive Pastry Chef Bashar al Shamali.
