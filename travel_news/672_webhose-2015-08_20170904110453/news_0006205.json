To determine the TCO for diesel and gasoline vehicles researchers compiled and compared data on a variety of expenses including depreciation, fuel costs, repairs, fees and taxes, insurance, and maintenance.\nIn 2014, diesel vehicles made up about three percent of the total U.S. vehicle market while gasoline cars made up more than 90 percent of the market.\nAccording to the report: \"There are dramatic changes taking place in the U.S. automotive industry as it moves to meet stringent government mandated Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) requirements. Clean diesel engine technology represents one of the technologies companies are using to improve fuel economy. This report not only compares the fuel efficiency of clean diesel vehicles to comparable gasoline versions of the same vehicle (sold at auction during the 2012-2013 timeframe), but it also compares the total cost of ownership (TCO) between the two types of technologies.\"\nDate: Wednesday, September 2 nd , Noon (ET)\nSpeaker: Bruce M.

With the transition to cleaner diesel fuel and new technology engines, and a sharpening focus on future fuel efficiency requirements, diesels are poised to continue to grow in the U.S.\nThis session will present new research findings that quantify the environmental and economic benefits for consumers in owning and operating a diesel car, truck or SUV, and societal benefits in fuel savings and emissions reductions. The session will also feature a state of play for diesels in the U.S. today, including current and future models, market outlooks, and will also address key factors in the consideration of a diesel including fuel prices and availability of fuel stations.\nDate: Wednesday, September 23 rd , Noon (ET)\nSpeaker: Casey Selecman , Senior Manager, Martec Group\nClick here to register.\nFor more information on the series go to http://www.dieselforum.org/about-the-forum/events\nThere is no cost for the webinars but space is limited.\nOther sessions in the Learning Series include:\nPower Up: State Initiatives To Enhance Readiness And Resiliency For Ensuring Continuous Electrical Operation For Key Businesses And Facilities During Grid Outages Climate Change And Fuel Saving Impacts Of New Clean Diesel Technology In Commercial Trucks Full Throttle: Keeping the Goods Flowing and Boats and Barges Moving While Improving Efficiency and Reducing Emissions.
