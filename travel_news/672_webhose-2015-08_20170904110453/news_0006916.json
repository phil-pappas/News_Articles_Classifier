Among the artefacts on display are a gold necklace given to war heroine Elizabeth Choy by Lady Shenton Thomas; a barrister gown worn by founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew; and a 1959 flexi disc of “Majulah Singapura” by the late composer Zubir Said. \nOne of the areas in the Gallery’s post-war section is titled A Nation In The Making, which is named after a radio play by Rajaratnam, Singapore’s first Foreign Minister, and features the “Pepper’s ghost” illusion technique combining objects and holograms to tell the story of a newspaper photographer who lived through the 1950s and 1960s. \nOn the second level is the Goh Seng Choo Gallery, which features works from the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings, as well as the new Life In Singapore: The Past 100 Years galleries, where personal histories take centre stage across four periods, from 1925 to 1985. \nArtefacts shown in the ‘Modern Colony’ gallery, which is one the new permanent galleries at the National Museum of Singapore. — TODAY pic Among its features are the zoetrope contraption based on Singapore’s first female Olympian, hurdler Tang Pui Wah, who took part in the 1952 Games in Helsinki; and a playful recreation of a drive-in cinema, complete with car “cut-outs”. \nThese galleries, which go deeper into specific decades, replace the previous Singapore Living Galleries, where areas were divided into themes such as fashion and food. \nTeo said they decided to move away from the thematic approach based on the museum’s collection. Instead, the museum has opted to create galleries based on personal experiences and stories. “So, the things that interest Singaporeans — entertainment, food — all are made available in all the areas,” she added. — TODAY More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T06:38:33.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
