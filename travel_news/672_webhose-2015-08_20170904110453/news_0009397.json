This was driven by strong operational performance at Aeroflot airline and the successful roll-out of Russia's first low-cost carrier, Pobeda, which has quickly become one the top airlines in the country. The Group also benefited from changes in the competitive landscape, taking market share from foreign carriers that decreased frequencies on a number of routes as well as less efficient Russian peers. \n\"Our focus on the high-growth domestic market paid off with strong increases in Group traffic, which drove revenue up 25.8% year-on-year to RUB 176.5 billion, while strict cost control reined in growth of operational expenses despite exchange rate volatility. As a result, in the first half of 2015 Aeroflot Group posted an operating profit of RUB 5.9 billion; EBITDA and EBITDAR also rose, and the EBITDA and EBITDAR margins increased 3.9 and 6.9 percentage points to 7.5% and 18.8%, respectively. \n\"The Group focused on fleet optimisation, cost-cutting, boosting efficiency of business processes and financial management, and maintaining a robust financial position. We are confident our policy of expanding our presence on the growing Russian market, maintaining customer loyalty and increasing business efficiency will enable continued growth in the Group's profitability as the Russian economy recovers.\" \nn 1H 2015, Aeroflot Group's revenue increased by 25.8% year-on-year to RUB 176,467 million, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from Scheduled passenger flights and Other revenues. \nRevenue from scheduled passenger flights in 1H 2015 increased by 30.0% year-on-year to RUB 144,087 million, boosted by 14.0% growth in passenger traffic year-on-year. Revenue from charter flights decreased by 71.0% to RUB 2,075 million, due to the Group's strategy to decrease its presence in this market segment, as well as overall market dynamics in tourism traffic. \nDespite a 1.0% decrease in the volume of cargo and mail carried in 1H 2015, cargo revenue increased 16.3% year-on-year on the back of stronger yields. \nOther revenues increased by 39.9% year-on-year to 25,863 million, mainly driven by an increase in FX-denominated revenues from airline agreements following changes in the exchange rate. \nIn 1H 2015, aircraft fuel costs increased by 11.1% year-on-year to RUB 44,714 million, due to the ruble weakening and increase in traffic volume. Excluding the FX rate effect, aircraft fuel costs decreased by 19.7% due to a decline in oil prices and the Group's initiatives to improve fuel efficiency. \nOperating costs not including aircraft fuel grew by 24.1% year-on-year to RUB 125,887 million. \nAircraft servicing and passenger services costs amounted to RUB 34,516 million, up 24.5% year-on-year. This increase was mainly due to the changes in the ruble exchange rate versus foreign currencies. Excluding the FX rate effect, these costs increased by 8.0%, primarily due to expanded scale of operations and traffic volume, as well as changes in service rates. \nStaff costs increased by 12.1% year-on-year to RUB 27,235 million, mainly due to additional motivational compensation for cabin crew (including bonuses for the sale of Sky Shop products on board), and increases in the rouble equivalent of salaries for employees based outside Russia. \nOperating lease expenses amounted to RUB 19,941 million, up 71.5% year-on-year, mostly due to the change in the ruble exchange rate (given that these expenses are denominated in foreign currencies). Other growth factors included expansion of the Group's fleet (net increase of 15 aircraft under operating lease, up 8.2% versus 30 June 2014), and an increase in the 6 month LIBOR rate in 1H 2015. \nAircraft maintenance costs increased by 41.3% year-on-year to RUB 13,098 million, mainly due to the change in the ruble exchange rate. Excluding the FX rate effect, such costs were flat year-on-year. \nSales and marketing, administration and general expenses increased 27.9% year-on-year to RUB 11,479 million. This growth was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses denominated in foreign currencies. \nDepreciation, amortisation and custom duties increased by 16.1% year-on-year to RUB 7,445 million, which was driven by additions of six new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft under finance lease agreements in 1H 2014. \nOther expenses decreased by 7.3% year-on-year to RUB 12,173 million, primarily due to a refund of fuel excise duties as a result of changes in legislation. \nAs a result of the above-mentioned factors, the Group's operating profit in 1H 2015 amounted to RUB 5,866 million (3.3% of revenue). EBITDAR reached RUB 33,252 million and EBITDAR margin increased 6.9 p.p. to 18.8%. \nFinance income for 1H 2015 more than doubled year-on-year to RUB 7,183 million, mainly due to foreign exchange gains from refunds of down payments for aircraft. \nThe increase of finance costs to RUB 7,441 million for 1H 2015 was mainly due to an increase in interest expenses and losses on derivatives. \nRealized loss from hedging of RUB 8,848 million is attributable to settlements under derivative instruments recognized in equity, as well as from realized result related to hedging of US dollar denominated revenue through lease obligations denominated in US dollars. \nAs a result of the above-mentioned factors, the Group's net loss for 1H 2015 amounted to RUB 3,541 million. \nTotal debt as of 30 June 2015 decreased by 2.6% versus 31 December 2014 to RUB 169,717 million. \nAs of 30 June 2015 undrawn lines available to Aeroflot Group from major Russian and international banks amounted to RUB 23.1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:36:24.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
