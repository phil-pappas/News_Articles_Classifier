It was easy to navigate, and looked professional. My search took me straight to a page about sporting equipment, which reassured me that a bike counted within my free baggage allowance. It was easy to search for flights from there, and the search function was easy to use. I could specify a day, and see results for three days either side. The flights were within my budget at £353 and they departed from Heathrow at convenient times too. \nThere was an option to hold the flights for 72 hours at a small charge of £5pp, which would be refunded if booked. It also told me how many seats were left at that price, which created an urgency to book. There were clear benefits to booking with the airline because drinks, snacks and baggage were included. Sporting goods and musical instruments: BA’s policy Musical instruments can be taken onboard as part of (but not in addition to) the free hand baggage allowance, provided they fit within the maximum bag dimensions. A double bass cannot be accommodated in any cabin, however, it can be accepted as checked baggage. This will be part of the checked baggage allowance so excess baggage charges may apply. British Airways will accept non-motorised bicycles up to 190cm in length, provided they are packed in a recognised bicycle bag. Diving equipment is accepted when packed in a recognised kit bag and does not exceed the maximum dimensions and weight restrictions for checked baggage. Bags weighing more than 23kg (51lb) may incur a heavy bag charge. Surfboards also qualify as checked baggage, providing they do not exceed the maximum weight restrictions for checked baggage and are packed in a recognised bag or case to safeguard against damage. \nSource: britishairways.com \n﻿ \nTTG has teamed up with React Surveys to simulate a realistic booking process each week – that means a mystery shopper looking for the best deal from agents and operators on the high street, online, on TV or in newspapers.
