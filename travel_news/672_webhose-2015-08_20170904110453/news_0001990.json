Last year, it was 39 percent.\nThere is still a troubling divide between how Blacks and Whites see this. Last year, 79 percent of Blacks said racism was a big problem in the United States. Now 86 percent feel that way.\nHard to believe it isn’t 100 percent.\nClearly, those cell phone videos of cop-on-Black violence made a difference. Seeing was believing.\nPew found :\n“This shift in public opinion is seen across the board. Growing shares in all regions of the country, and across all demographic and partisan groups say both that racism is a big problem and that more needs to be done to achieve racial equality. Still, significant partisan divides remain on these questions, with Republicans less likely than Democrats to hold these views.”\nYes, folks, Republicans are still in denial.\nThis is illustrated by reaction to South Carolina’s decision to remove the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds. Seventy-four percent of Democrats and 53 percent of independents thought it was the right decision, according to Pew. Only 43 percent of Republicans felt that way.\nMeanwhile, giants still walk among us.\nOn the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Rep. John Lewis sent out a missive via the White House about the importance of continuing the fight for voting rights.\nLewis was among the peaceful protesters beaten by Alabama state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. He said he thought he would die that day. Instead, he became a member of Congress.\nOn April 14, 2000, he signed a copy of his book for me. On the title page of “Walking With the Wind,” Lewis wrote, “Keep the faith.”\nIn his missive from the White House , he explained why it's still necessary:\n“. . . far too many states are passing new laws that make it harder and more difficult to vote.\n“Early voting and voter registration drives have been restricted. Same-day voting has been eliminated in some cases. Strict photo identification laws have been adopted, and improper purges of the voting rolls are negating access to thousands, perhaps millions, who have voted for decades.”\nThe NAACP is leading a 40-day march from Selma to Washington, D.C. to raise the profile of this and other issues.\nThis year, more Americans understand why that’s necessary.\nKeep the faith.\nThat also means get off your chair.\nAs he proclaimed Sept. 22 as National Voter Registration Day, President Barack Obama spoke a truth he said would not be popular among those who like to complain about how things are.\n\"Far more people disenfranchise themselves than any law does,\" Obama said. \"Huge chunks of us just give away our power.\" They don't vote.\nSo keep the faith. And use the power.\n\"Heroic things happen when people get involved,\" the president said.", "external_links": ["https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/08/06/50-years-after-voting-rights-act-we-still-have-work-do", "http://www.people-press.org/2015/08/05/across-racial-lines-more-say-nation-needs-to-make-changes-to-achieve-racial-equality/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/06/us/in-year-since-searing-death-ferguson-sees-uneven-recovery.html?_r=0", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/08/06/50-years-ago"], "published": "2015-08-06T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:20:28.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
