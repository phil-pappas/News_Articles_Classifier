The Hotel offers the convenience of a city hotel with all the amenities of a full-service resort. Situated just moments from downtown Palo Alto shops, restaurants, international airports, major freeways and technology’s heaviest hitters, the Hotel is truly at the epicentre of innovation. Opening its doors in January 2006, the Hotel will continue to elevate the tradition of luxury with an enhanced look and feel that’s only fitting for the area.\nUtilising clean lines and stylistic restraint, the vision for the updated guest rooms was a study in selective tailoring. Crisp forms anchor the contemporary spaces and provide a distinct yet approachable composition to Silicon Valley’s most prominent guest rooms. Veering from its more corporate origins, the updated design sought to soften the look through the use of sculptural artwork, warm hues and textural fabrics.\n“The existing rooms had a strong architectural character but were somewhat austere in their appearance,” notes Heather O’Sullivan, the guest room project’s designer with Whitespace Interiors. “Our goal was to add dimension by creating greater contrast and by layering rich textures over simple materials to create visual energy, depth and richness.”\nFrom the abstract new artwork to the stylish new loungers, no detail has been overlooked. High-tech enhancements perfect for the discerning traveller include multiple outlet charging stations, Bose music systems, and the addition of AT&T antennas located on each floor to enhance connectivity.\nLet’s not forget the most important experience at every Four Seasons hotel. Every room in the Hotel has been crafted to facilitate a fluid transition between work, relaxing, sleep, and everything in between. As part of a Four Seasons global brand initiative, the Hotel will introduce the Four Seasons Bed, offering guests the opportunity to choose their own bed type including Signature, Signature Firm, or Signature Plush, allowing them to personalise their sleep during every stay for a unique “Sleep Temple” experience. A sleep menu offers luxury sleep aid items including the choice of Tempur-Pedic, foam or body pillows, and tasty bites such as chamomile tea with lavender shortbread cookies, and cherry “Sleep Elixir” to aid with sweeter dreams. Natural remedy oils by H. Gillerman are available to help relax and de-stress, leading to a more restful, elevated sleep.\nMeeting and event space updates were inspired by Silicon Valley’s startup culture and innovative spirit. Designer EDG Interior Architecture + Design used crisp lines and grid-like details for structure, together with a luxurious colour palette of cherry wood, charcoal, dark walnut and champagne metal details to create a sense of effortless sophistication. A custom, variegated carpet design featuring plum and persimmon strands, connects the spaces throughout the Hotel.\n“We wanted to enhance guest experience and comfort, while paying homage to the dynamic qualities of the Valley, with a sense of drama,” notes EDG Principal Jason Dries-Daffner. The overall look is contemporary and with crisp details such as stylish custom light fixtures providing the perfect touches to match high-tech enhancements such as a digital customisable marquee, 21-inch iMac meeting room signage, and adjustable audio and lighting options at one’s fingertips. From intimate meetings of two to presentations for 400, configurable air walls and a muted colour scheme enable flexibility, provide the perfect backdrop and add plenty of options suited for any event.\n“We’re always looking for ways to amplify the guest experience,” says Tracy Mercer, General Manager of Four Seasons Hotel Silicon Valley. “We’re very excited to unveil our latest enhancements to all our guests and offer a heightened luxury experience one can expect from a Four Seasons.”\nCall 650 566 1200 to schedule an appointment for a sneak peek of select guest rooms and meeting spaces or stay tuned for a grand reveal reception on Friday, September 11, 2015 from 6:00 to 8:00 pm for an open house not to be missed.
