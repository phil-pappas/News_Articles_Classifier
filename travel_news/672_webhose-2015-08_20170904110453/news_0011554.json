The major trend is down. The odds favor that this is to be only the first phase of the decline. Today's rally could take us to 1965 - 2040 level on the S&P 500. \nGold stocks have retraced a good portion of its move to 112 as it almost printed 107. The SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ) looks as if it is just starting a new downtrend looking for a count to 100/101. It is still intermediately confirmed bearish. At this time, since we have new positions on, wait until metals hit bottom and have been confirmed bullish before adding a new trade. Silver should have a nice pullback as well. Silve has now turned technically bearish today. \nCurrent SPX Heat Map \nInternational Markets All Confirmed Bearish \nIn the last week-and-a-half, the S&P 500 lost nearly $2 trillion in market capitalization, with $900 billion in this week's first two trading sessions alone. \nThe Dow traveled another 1,600 points during Tuesday's trading session which added to the 4,900 points the index traveled in down and up moves on Monday. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:04:22.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
