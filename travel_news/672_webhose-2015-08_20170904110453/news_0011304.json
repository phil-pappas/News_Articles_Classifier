The Star Tribune reports that Louisiana-based HRI Properties has landed $65 million in financing from U.S. Bank to convert the 105-year-old building at Sixth Street and Hennepin Avenue. The paper notes that the announcement from U.S. Bank \"is the first official confirmation\" of the HRI's purchase of the building, but the deal has been known about for months. The Business Journal reported it back in May . HRI paid $20 million for the property, which is included in U.S. Bank's estimate of the total conversion cost. The developer is also getting about $16 million in federal historic tax credits and $1.5 million in grants from the city of Minneapolis. Officials at U.S. Bank, part of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), said the bank has worked with HRI on other projects and of course knew the property well, which helped the it get comfortable with making the deal. The Plymouth Building, at 12 S. Sixth St., was constructed in 1910 and added in 2014 to the National Register of Historic Places. \nGet Minneapolis / St. Paul Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:26:23.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
