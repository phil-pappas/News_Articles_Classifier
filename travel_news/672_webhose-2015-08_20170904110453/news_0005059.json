Where storms are situated over an airport, they will either wait for it to move or land somewhere else.\n'A storm nearby also affects aircraft refuelling and the electrical activity can affect radio transmissions as well.'\nLast month MailOnline reported dramatic point-of-view footage from inside a passenger jet captured during a violent landing in severe weather in Amsterdam.\nThe video was captured on July 25 and shows the inside of the plane bumping around in a violent manner while coming into land at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol.\nDramatic emergency landing inside plane during bad weather People can be heard voicing their panic and anticipating the touch-down as the video maker stares down and holds his camera towards the ground – it is unclear whether he has adopted the brace position.\nThe plane then lands with a thud and the relieved passengers respond by clapping and celebrating as the aircraft manoeuvres safely along the tarmac before coming to a stop.\nAnd days later one of American Airlines’ new Boeing 787 Dreamliners was badly battered by hail on a flight from Beijing to Dallas Monday and had to turn back.\nThe Texas-bound Flight 88 carrying 209 passengers and a crew of 13 on board returned to Beijing after sustaining hail damage 44 minutes into the voyage, said airline spokeswoman Andrea Huguely.\nThe pilots landed the banged up aircraft safely, and no injuries were reported.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MeIAJX"], "published": "2015-08-07T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:00:54.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
