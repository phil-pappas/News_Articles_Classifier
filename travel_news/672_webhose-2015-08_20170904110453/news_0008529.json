This engine order is valued at more than $400 million (USD) list price. Deliveries will begin in 2017.\n“Qantas’ selection of the GEnx engine for its newly announced Boeing 787-9 aircraft is another vote of confidence for this engine that is the leading engine choice of 787 Dreamliner operators around the world,” said Chaker Chahrour, vice president and general manager of Global Sales & Marketing at GE Aviation. “The GEnx-1B engine offers operators outstanding performance, fuel burn and reliability that sets it apart in its class.”\nThe GEnx-1B engine is the best-selling engine on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The engine has accumulated more than 1.7 million flight hours and more than 300,000 cycles since entering service. More than 1,600 GEnx-1B engines have been sold to more than 50 customers.\nCompared to GE’s CF6 engine, the GEnx engine offers up to 15 percent better fuel efficiency, which translates to 15 percent less CO2. The GEnx’s innovative twin-annular pre-swirl (TAPS) combustor dramatically reduces NOx gases as much as 55 percent below today’s regulatory limits and other regulated gases as much as 90 percent. Based on the ratio of decibels to pounds of thrust, the GEnx is the quietest engine GE produces due to the large, more efficient fan blades that operate at slower tip speed, resulting in about 40 percent lower noise levels.\nThe GEnx is part of GE’s “ecomagination” product portfolio – GE’s business strategy to develop new, cost-effective technologies that enhance customers’ environmental and operating performance.\nRevenue-sharing participants on the GEnx are IHI Corporation of Japan, Volvo Aero of Sweden, MTU of Germany, TechSpace Aero (Safran) of Belgium, Snecma (SAFRAN Group) of France and Samsung Techwin of Korea.\nFounded in the Queensland outback in 1920, Qantas has grown to be Australia’s largest domestic and international airline. The Qantas Group is already operating the GEnx-powered Boeing 787-8 that entered service at its subsidiary airline Jetstar in October 2013.\nGE Aviation, an operating unit of GE is a world-leading provider of jet and turboprop engines, components and integrated systems for commercial, military, business and general aviation aircraft. GE Aviation has a global service network to support these offerings.\nSource:- Geaviation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:37:31.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
