If however you enjoy stunningly picturesque courses capable of testing even the most accomplished players, then it is certainly worth taking on some of the hazards you might to encounter during a round on the sun soaked island. While Cyprus cannot boast the sort of golfing pedigree that sees thousands flock to the courses of southern Spain or the Algarve each year, it has been quietly building a reputation as a hugely enjoyable alternative. With four impressive, but quite different courses, all within a half hour drive of the popular resort of Paphos, and another course planned for the Limassol area, Cyprus is emerging as a genuine contender on the European holiday golfing map. • The best US golf holidays • The 10 best links golf courses in Britain and Ireland Situated amongst the jagged terrain that climbs steadily from the Paphos coast is the Aphrodite Hills Golf Club , probably the best known course on the island, and one for which a head for heights is advisable. Designed by American, Cabell B Robinson, the course is spread across two plateaus which are separated by a dramatic rocky canyon. Taking five years to construct it opened in 2002 and provides a hugely enjoyable experience for the holiday golfer, with some truly memorable holes. The signature seventh is a fine example, where just getting to the tee box can set your vertigo off. After completing the sixth, a relatively generous par 5, you set off on a lengthy buggy commute which culminates in a tight manoeuvre down a hair pin track, reminiscent of San Francisco’s famous Lombard Street. Half-way down, jutting out of the side of the cliff on a precarious looking ledge, is the tee for this stunning par 3. At around 140 yards to the pin with fairly benign bunkers on each side, there is nothing especially challenging about the hole. But the 100 ft deep gorge you need to clear in order to reach the green can certainly set the nerves jangling if you do not like heights. Once you have played your shot it’s back into the buggy for another hair raising ride into the bowels of the gorge before climbing up the other side in order to reach the green (or if you were unlucky, the drop zone). The next hole is almost as picturesque, if slightly less precarious, a 323 yard narrow par 4, with the azure Med sparkling in the distance. Keen to remind players of the local traditions, the designers have placed an ancient olive press in the middle of the fairway, providing a quirky if frustrating hazard. Aphrodite Hills is arguably the most memorable of the courses in Cyprus and is the sort of experience that will have even the most discerning of players itching to come back for more. But for a first time visitor it is certainly worth giving one of the other courses a try. Less than a ten minute drive from Aphrodite Hills is the Secret Valley course. As the name suggests, this achingly pretty course sits astride a picturesque valley that meanders its way inland from the coast. Opened in 1996 the course is spectacularly scenic, with a wide variety of mature plant and tree life and a number of challenging water features. With narrow, tree lined fairways a common feature throughout, accuracy off the tee is important if you are to get the most from this course. Wayward drives can result in you plunging into thick undergrowth where rather unnervingly signs remind you of one of the other course hazards: “Beware of snakes”. Cyprus is home to the blunt nosed viper which is highly venomous and loves to nestle in rocky shaded areas, just the sort of place a sliced ball likes to settle. With a series of fairly straightforward holes easing you into the round, the course certainly becomes more challenging and when the wind whips up through the valley from the sea, the longer par fours can become quite tricky. Complaints on message boards about the state of the greens and fairways certainly seem to have been addressed and even at the height of the summer, the course remains in excellent condition. The third of the courses making up Pahos’s golfing triangle is the Elea Estate , which offers a wholly different experience from its neighbours. • Golf in Portugal: New greens and old pros on the Algarve • Golf in Scotland: How to play at St Andrews and Kingsbarns Situated in a less dramatic and admittedly less picturesque setting than the other two, Elea Estate offers the sort of intriguing challenge that will probably appeal more to the more strategic players. Designed by Sir Nick Faldo and opened in 2010, the Elea Estate is the island’s newest course and cleverly makes a feature of Cyprus’s barren landscape. With relatively generous fairways and few natural hazards to negotiate, Elea Estate allows a little leniency off the tee. But trouble comes in the form of sand with more than 60 bunkers strategically scattered around the course. The par 4 fourth hole with two huge jigsaw piece shaped bunkers appears to feature more sand than fairway as you tee off and those players who favour power over accuracy may find they spend a lot of time with a sand wedge in their grip. The 17th hole is also a stunning test, as well as being a potential card wrecker, featuring a savagely sloping fairway that seems to tempt you into trouble. Overall Elea is a course that requires a little homework and preparation if you want to really enjoy it and don’t want to spend every hole with a rake in your hand. It is a worthy test for golfers of all abilities but will perhaps favour those lower handicap players who like to be challenged in all aspects of the game. With such a variety of golfing experiences on offer within the Paphos area, this popular resort makes an ideal base and also provides plenty of alternative entertainment for family members who don’t play.
