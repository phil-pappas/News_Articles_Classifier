The museum acquired the home in 2013 and the entire structure was taken apart and brought to northwest Arkansas. The home was then reassembled on the grounds of Crystal Bridges.\nThe museum says the home is an example of Wright's classic Usonian architecture, which was his distinctly American style of residential architecture that he developed during the Great Depression. Crystal Bridges says the Usonian homes were simpler and lower-cost than Wright's more elaborate, highly customized homes.\nAbout 120 Usonian homes were built.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:12:47.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
