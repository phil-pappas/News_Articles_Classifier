Szigeti, president and CEO of the HTA. \"Congratulations to this year's honorees and mahalo to the ranches throughout the state for continuing to help shape our islands' unique culture and story.\" \nParker Ranch (Hawaii Island) \nLocated in Waimea on beautiful Hawaii Island, this 250,000-acre farm dates back to the early 1850s. John Parker purchased 640 acres in 1850 and another 1,000 acres the following year from Kamehameha III. The ranch has grown into an educational attraction where visitors can learn about its rich history, witness one of the oldest-running rodeos and enjoy the vast landscape. \nKualoa Ranch (Oahu) \nEstablished in 1850, Kualoa Ranch is a 4,000-acre working cattle ranch on the windward side of O'ahu, which strives to preserve, protect and promote Hawai'i's natural beauty and culture. Its lush backdrop can be seen in a number of blockbuster movies including Jurassic Park, Pearl Harbor and 50 First Dates, and visitors can enjoy the Ranch through a variety of activities, including movie tours, ATV rides and hikes. \nUlupalakua Ranch (Maui) \nThis ranch reigns as Maui's second largest, extending across 18,000 acres of land. Originally founded by James Linton Torbert as \"Torbertsville\" in 1845, Ulupalakua Ranch became one of the greatest sugar producers and today remains a \"steward to the land,\" cultivating and protecting Maui's agriculture, as well as perpetuating the ranch lifestyle and culture. Visitors to the ranch can experience the island's only winery or enjoy activities including horseback riding and sporting clay shooting. \nKipu Ranch (Kauai) \nStretching from the Huleia River to the summit of Mount Haupu spanning a total of 3,000 acres. Originally used as a sugar plantation, the area has transformed to a working cattle ranch and is home to both beautiful scenery and remarkable wildlife. Its unique landscapes, which include mountains, pastures, forests and rivers makes it a popular site for movie directors and families looking to experience Hawaii's great outdoors. \nEvolving from HTA's \"Keep it Hawaii\" program, the Tourism Legacy Awards was established to honor individuals, organizations and businesses that perpetuate Hawaiian culture and traditions. Honorees have worked diligently to nurture the Hawaiian culture creating respectful and authentic visitor experiences while securing bonds between the visitor industry and the Hawaiian community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T11:24:11.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
