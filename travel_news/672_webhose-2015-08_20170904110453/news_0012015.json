We leave our car at the top - this is 4x4 terrain.\nThe cabin is homely, but quietly clever, with solar-powered lights and phone charger, a wood-burning stove, compost loo and chandelier made from glass yoghurt pots that can be lowered over the small dining table using a pulley system.\nA retreat from the world: Fisherman's Cabin was built for the BBC presenter Kate Humble and her husband\nThe shower takes a couple of hours to heat (via solar energy) enough water for two.\nIf it sounds like a faff, it isn't.\n Next Yes, camping really can be romantic: How we spent our 15th... All that jazz in a sunny slice of Switzerland: Sumptuous... Basque brilliance: Why Bilbao is the perfect city for a... So good they named it twice: Sue Lawley loses her heart to... My boyfriend and I bathe in the evening and crawl under the duvet like cats. The cabin, in Perigord-Limousin National Park, was built for former BBC Springwatch presenter Kate Humble and her husband by a middle-aged British couple called Bob and Di, who now act as the cabin's caretakers.\nFor Humble it's a holiday home and is rented out for the rest of the year.\nAnd here, you are very much off-grid. My phone only flickers into life once - in the local village Piegut-Pluviers, six miles away.\nIdyllic: Despite its name, Fisherman's Cabin sits in Perigord-Limousin National Park in the Dordogne\nLocals and holidaymakers flock to the Wednesday morning market, where we buy cheese, vegetables dusted with earth and still warm organic eggs.\nThere are stalls selling laminated tablecloths decorated with animals and Poldark-style tricorn hats. The local supermarket offers bottles of very drinkable Burgundy. We retire to the cabin full of promises to go out for dinner the following night.\nIt never happens. When the woodburner is blazing (there's a wood store outside) and the only light you can see is from your twinkling yoghurt pot chandelier, there's very little to tempt you away.\nThe daytime is a different story. We are amid forest, farm, vineyards and wide- open roads.\nWe paddle round the edges of 'our lake' on a hand-made raft made, naturally, by Bob. It's eerily quiet.\nSimple pleasures: The cabin is designed as an escape from everything, and has no mobile phone signal\nBob and Di lend us their tandem, so we pedal downhill to the next village, Busserolles, and stop for a beer. Unbelievably, we end up cycling 30km, pushing the tandem up the steepest hills via the nearest town, Saint Mathieu.\nOn the days it rains — and it pours — we buy baguettes from the supermarket, curl up and see to that Burgundy. If this is glamping, then we're naturals.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own rustic stay in the Dordogne Book Fisherman's Cabin , which sleeps four, through Canopy & Stars (0117 204 7830, www.canopyandstars.co.uk ) from £82 per night.
