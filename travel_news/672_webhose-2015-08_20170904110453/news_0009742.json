Wayne Allard , vice president for government relations for the American Motorcyclist Association. \"The results prove that, just like our members, rank and file Americans have serious concerns about the damaging and far-reaching effects of excessive ethanol production and that they support efforts to rein in this misdirected federal policy.\"\nPolling results also indicate that majorities across party lines support bi-partisan efforts in Congress to reform the ethanol mandate, with slightly more people backing an outright repeal of the law. And 44 percent of voters said they would be less likely to support a presidential candidate who supported the ethanol mandate.\nPoll results show that a majority of voters nationwide have serious concerns about the effects of the RFS:\n78 percent of those polled had serious concerns that higher blends of ethanol such as E-15 can cause severe damage in cars, motorcycles, boats, lawn equipment and other small engines. 73 percent of polled voters had serious concerns about an EPA analysis showing that emissions that contribute to climate change are 28 percent higher from corn ethanol than pure gasoline. 77 percent of those polled had serious concerns about corn ethanol production consuming 34 times more water than pure gasoline. 80 percent of polled voters had serious concerns about how diverting corn to produce ethanol could increase food prices. The poll was conducted via phone with professional interviewers using both landline and cell phones from July 6 through July 10 . Interviewers reached 1000 national likely 2016 voters, 40 percent were reached via cell phone. The partisan breakdown includes 40 percent self-identified Democrats, 34 percent self-identified Republicans, and 23 percent self-identified independents. The margin of error for the survey is +/- 3.1%.\n releases/new-national-poll-indicates-voters-want-federal-ethanol-mandate-reformed-300135180.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://origin-qps.onstreammedia.com/origin/multivu_archive/MNR/7576751_MNR_0828.mp4&skin=http://fpdownload.adobe.com/FlexPlayer/jwplayer/skin/en.xml&autostart=false&poster=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/62957fef-dbd8-4350-8987-38a89a0e905d.jpg", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/62957fef-dbd8-4350-8987-38a89a0e905d.jpg", "http://origin-qps.onstreammedia.com/origin/multivu_archive/MNR/7576751_BillByrne_0813.mp4&skin=http://fpdownload.adobe.com/FlexPlayer/jwplayer/skin/en.xml&autostart=false&poster=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/1fabbc9e-1268-4bff-9fd0-d613ef0561c7.jpg", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150831/262208", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/ad9920a4-8ff4-450a-85bd-721af48a1ceb.jpg", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/1fabbc9e-1268-4bff-9fd0-d613ef0561c7.jpg", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-national-poll-indicates-voters-want-federal-ethanol-mandate-reformed-300135180.html", "http://smarterfuelfuture.org/assets/content/FINAL_Voter_Attitudes_Toward_the_Renewable_Fuel_Standard.pdf", "https://fpdownload.adobe.com/strobe/FlashMediaPlayback.swf", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/image/43d592ad-7e7d-4cfd-9978-c09b69fdbe64.HR.jpg", "http://origin-qps.onstreammedia.com/origin/multivu_archive/MNR/7576751_AMAVintageDays_0813.mp4&skin=http://fpdownload.adobe.com/FlexPlayer/jwplayer/skin/en.xml&autostart=false&poster=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7576751-ama-national-ethanol-voter-poll/gallery/video/ad9920a4-8ff4-450a-85bd-721af48a1ceb.jpg", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=MM79445&Transmission_Id=201508310949PR_NEWS_USPR_____MM79445&DateId=20150831"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T20:18:03.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
