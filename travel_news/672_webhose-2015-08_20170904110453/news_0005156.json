And this does not include banquets and entertainment activities or events held at TenOnCall which services the short-lead or just-in-time corporate meetings sector.\n“After a decade of operation, it is fitting that in our 10th anniversary year, we have hosted many prestigious government-related events and we are honoured to be have been selected the venue of choice for many ASEAN ministerial meetings.”In addition, Pryor says, “we are fortunate to have a loyal client base such as BookFest,HOMEDEC, PIKOM PC Fair, ARCHIDEX, Star Education Fair and Asia Oil & Gas Conference who have all made consecutive appearances and/or hosted every (event) edition with us since our opening in June 2005.”\nThat said, “a knowledgeable and professional team committed to meeting and satisfying clients’ evolving meetings needs by consistently delivering flexible, innovative and value-add solutions across the board has also been integral to our success and a key point of difference.”\nMoving forward, to reward loyal repeat clients and entice new regulars, the Centre has extended the 2014 prices for her popular Day Conference Packages (DCPs) With a Difference, PlenaryOnCall, PlenaryHallOnCall and Banquets & Functions menus through to the end of the first quarter next year (2016). “Coupled with what’s happening around the venue, we are confident of finishing (the year) on a strong note and into the next year,” adds Pryor.\nSource:-Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T09:29:33.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
