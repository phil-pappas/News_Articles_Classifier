Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript \nROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: An inflatable luminous structure called the 'Luminous Arboria' created by British artist Alan Parkinson has been set up in Geneva to offer local and tourists a relaxing summer activity. The 1000 square metre structure is a coloured maze, made of a unique plastic produced specially for Parkinson's company, called 'Architects of Air'. The structure uses light to turn four colours into a diversity of subtle hues. \"What I am sharing is an unusual space that they wouldn't normally experience and it's a space that can give a profound sense of the phenomenon of light,\" Parkinson said. The opening of a flap leads visitors into a labyrinth of brightly coloured winding paths and pockets emanating a glow by filtering the light from the outdoors. It takes five people and five months to build the balloon-like structure -- laying it out and anchoring it can take as little as five hours and then in just 20 minutes, the luminarium is inflated to become a giant maze. \"It is very relaxing but it is also very strange. Like Alice in Wonderland kind of,\" said a tourist from Los Angeles named Leila. The structure is made up of 10-metre high domes and tunnels which connect the domes to map out a path visitors take when they enter. The luminarium features pods or alcoves where people can lie down, relax and take in the glow of the light. Since it was set up last week, the structure has had some 6000 visitors.
