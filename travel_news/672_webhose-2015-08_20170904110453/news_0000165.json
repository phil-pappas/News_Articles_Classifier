Open to all registered event delegates, this initiative is aimed at encouraging attendees to share their show experience with peers through social media and via the mobile app in-guide sharing platforms. \n“We have delegates who simply enjoy keeping their networks posted about interesting things they are involved in or have discovered. From the sights and sounds of Bangkok, the latest phrase of inspiration they have heard from one of our reputed speakers, to the destinations, products and services that have piqued their interest at the exhibition hall or networking function. The idea is to reward them for sharing and to encourage more delegates to join in the exchange,” said Darren Ng, Managing Director of TTG Asia Media. Like the other Sticky Award titles, the “Stickiest Social Sharing” winner will be determined by votes from other delegates, as well as by the organisers who will consider both the content and frequency of posts that had left the biggest impression. Shares made in the lead-up to the event will also be considered. The winner will be announced during the “Sticky Awards” Networking Lunch on 1 October. To facilitate winner selection, all posts must be identifiable with the delegate’s registered name and company name along with the relevant hashtags #itcma2015 and/or #ctwapac2015 on Twitter, Facebook or the mobile app in-guide photo gallery. Delegates are also required to log-into the mobile guide and check themselves in as an attendee to qualify for the award. Meanwhile, IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific’s mobile app guide, powered by Guidebook, will be accessible only by registered delegates, as it contains exclusive event content. This includes the essential Show Directory that features the full list of exhibitors and their profiles (this will replace hard copies), delegate listings, alerts to keep delegates updated of latest developments, personalisable programme schedules, and interactive floorplans of the exhibition hall and conference areas amongst others. Delegates will also have access to the mobile guide’s connect function that allows them to see who else is attending the event, and exchange contact information virtually. “The Connect feature comes in handy given the number of delegates attending the event, and the inability to meet everyone face-to-face during the 3-days. Checking into the guide allows them to connect with other delegates via their smartphone or tablet.” says Alex Goldberg, Senior Marketing Manager of Guidebook. Organisers will unlock mobile guide functions and update content in the lead-up to the show. IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 will be held from 29 September to 1 October 2015 at the Bangkok Convention Centre at CentralWorld.
