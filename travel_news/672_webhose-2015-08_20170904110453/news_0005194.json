Participating AFTA members will contribute to a weekly, consolidated, forward-bookings measurement: the first of its kind in Australia. \nThe GfK Travelscan, which is based on consolidated and aggregated industry booking data, is used by the travel industry to better predict market developments and to help businesses run more efficiently. Travelscan is one of a suite of specialised solutions for the travel and hospitality industry developed by GfK, one of the world’s leading market insights companies. “We’re delighted to be working with AFTA to introduce a new travel industry market currency to Australia”, said Gwenno Hopkin, General Manager of GfK Australia. “The GfK Travelscan product is already established in Europe and is being rolled-out throughout APAC. It has become a ‘must-have’ business tool for travel retailers in those countries, and we are certain the Australian travel community will benefit from an aggregated read of outbound and domestic trends.” “As the travel agency community becomes more self-sufficient and less reliant on government in this industry regulated environment, important travel data will be key to help maintain and build good travel agents across Australia” said Jayson Westbury, CEO AFTA. “AFTA believes it is imperative that we support travel agents in understanding their business better and this travel industry market currency has proven very powerful in other markets around the world. To be at the cutting edge and to really understand what the trends look like, travel agencies need data. Travelscan will deliver this perfectly,” said Westbury. “I encourage all travel agency owners to get involved in this industry wide initiative and to be a part of sharing data with GfK, one of the most trusted sources of market and consumer information platforms in the world,” said Westbury.
