Sign In Here Rachel Spencer Hewitt stands in her kitchen with her 10-month-old daughter on her hip. The sight is so natural, the baby almost looks like an extension of the mom’s outfit. Hewitt reaches into her cherry cabinet for some Cheerios. She places the box down on the kitchen island and one-handedly, reaches in to grab some cereal for herself and “E,” as Hewitt affectionately calls her daughter. Across from the box is an unmistakable, neon orange sticky note. It’s from a couple named Peter and Tara addressed to Hewitt and her husband Brock. “Thank you for hosting us! We had a lovely stay,” it read. Hewitt didn’t know Peter and Tara before the couple’s stay in her Fairmount home and wouldn’t have if she hadn’t opened up her doors through Airbnb in 2014. They aren’t alone. The service has taken off in Philadelphia and many other places. But there is a key difference: Philadelphia — long known for its glacial pace in dealing with macro-business change — recently became the largest U.S. city to essentially legalize Airbnb after City Council passed legislation putting an 8.5 percent hotel tax on the service. Many other cities are challenging the service, in court and in legislation. In one action, Philadelphia became a leader in the new, so-called “sharing” or “gig” economy, and it could have wide implications for the region’s business community. Like many Philadelphians, Hewitt is using her spare bedroom to cash in. But others are doing it through other well-known and not-so-well-known ways. She’s like the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. employee who becomes an Uber driver by night or a college undergraduate using TaskRabbit, an app that allows users to pick up small jobs like getting dry cleaning or grabbing groceries, to ease the burden of tuition. Technology has grown the sharing economy into an uncontrollable weed. Politicians are incorporating talks of the “gig economy” in campaign speeches, while economists predict that its impact will change the way we do business entirely in some industries. The politician Councilman William Greenlee ’s office sits on the fifth floor of City Hall where on a recent afternoon two co-workers were talking vacation plans. “I was thinking about renting Airbnb,” one said. The conversation is somewhat ironic; Greenlee – along with Mayor Michael Nutter – is the person most responsible for extending the 8.5 percent hotel tax to home rentals. It went into effect July 1, months before 1.5 million additional visitors are expected in Philadelphia for Pope Francis’ visit in September. The bill is meant to regulate home-sharing services, like Airbnb, where guests rent out rooms and homes. Now, any host who rents to a guest for more than 90 days has to apply for a permit — however, the host can’t rent out a space for more than 180 days a year. “I don’t think we should embrace something just because it’s new and say, ‘Well, we want to be the first or one of the first,’” Greenlee said. “But by the same token, I think you have to be open-minded. Things change, options come in and you have to be open about it — but again, with the proper regulations.” Greenlee admits that the pope’s planned visit had something to do with how quickly the bill was passed, though how much the city will make from the additional funds is hard to say. The councilman, along with tourism and economy experts all agree that the service, which was founded in 2008 and is based in San Francisco, will grow at a fast pace. “City councils and other municipalities across the world recognize it’s making a huge impact, so they’re making it legal,” said Michael Sheridan, assistant professor at the Temple University School of Tourism and Hospitality Management. Airbnb reported that the service generated $632 million in economic activity in New York City in 2012 and 2013 while it generated $51 million in Boston during the same time period. Philadelphia numbers aren’t available. Meryl Levitz , president and CEO of Visit Philadelphia, said that Airbnb will ease a hotel room shortage in the city. Levitz and others say it may also push tourism beyond Center City’s boundaries, boosting economic activity in smaller neighborhoods like Fishtown and Fairmount. Philadelphia’s tourism industry is going strong with almost 40 million visitors last year that spent about $30 million a day, according to a report by Visit Philadelphia. “What it reflects more than anything else is one, how the industry itself is changing and two, how much Philadelphia itself is changing,” Levitz said. Share and share alike Smart phones, the Internet and an aging millennial generation have grown the sharing economy tenfold. There’s a multitude of apps that allow anyone to join in the sharing economy and cut out the middleman: the hotel chains and reservation companies, taxi and chauffer services, etc. There’s Yerdle, a virtual thrift store; DogVacay, which lets pet owners find places for their animals to stay while traveling; and Spinlister which allows athletes to rent sports equipment. “Millennials are born with a smartphone in their hands,” Sheridan said. “It’s like an extension of their arms.” But not everyone is singing the praises of this new landscape. Those traditional industries are threatened. Economists say coexistence is possible, but, in any kind of capitalism, there are inevitably winners and losers. There may be jobs lost, but hardly enough to put entire industries out of business, said Dr. Moritz Ritter, an assistant professor of economics at Temple . The competition will just force them to adapt. But from an economic standpoint, Ritter said, the added inventory that these services provide is beneficial. “The overall size of the pie has grown so much now that people can afford services they never could before,” he said. The Uber question Since Airbnb’s popularity is arguably in its infancy in Philadelphia, the city can only look to other examples to see its impact, the most obvious one being Uber, the ridesharing service. UberX is often cheaper than a cab and its easy-to-use features made it quickly popular, though it’s still illegal under a state statute enforced by the Philadelphia Parking Authority, giving City Council little control. UberBlack, which operates more like a limousine service makes it exempt from strict taxi and taxi-like regulations and therefore legal. But Uber reports that it has created more than 20,000 jobs in the state and is adding more than 3,000 jobs across every state each month. By the end of the year, they hope to make more than $100 million in net earnings. The service is also growing beyond pickups and drop-offs. An Uber spokesman said that specialty services like carpooling and food delivery are available for select cities across the nation – they’re being guinea pigged to see if they’ll stack up to launch elsewhere. Uber is a strong force that’s challenged taxicabs, an industry that’s hardly evolved since its beginning. Ron Blount from the Taxi Workers Alliance of Pennsylvania said that the industry “was a mess” before Uber. “Uber was definitely a wake-up call,” Blount said. Taxis had to adapt to the change, illustrated by their 215-GET-A-CAB app available for download in June 2014. Similarly to Uber, users can request a cab by way of smartphone but don’t need a credit card to do so. Blount said that taxis are most affected by the competition during nights and weekends, but day times are business as usual. He also said that he’s seen a lot of the city’s taxi drivers move to Uber — 300 members out of the 1,200 of the association have become UberBlack drivers, Blount said. While comparing Uber and regular taxis are easy since the services are so similar, comparing Airbnb with hotels are like apples and oranges, say some academic economists. Hotels offer a stable product where users know what they’re paying for. Airbnb is like sleeping at a friend’s, no room service or mints on the pillow. But hotels will feel some of the effects. A study published in 2013 by Boston University looked at the relationship between Airbnb and the hotel industry and estimated its impact. Conducted in Austin, Texas, the economists concluded that in areas where the service is most used, hotels took a 10 percent dent from normal revenues in the past five years. If people believe they’re just sticking it to the man by using sharing services, they may be mistaken. Lower-level workers may be affected. “Do we want to get rid of full-time work and just go to general out-of-contract jobs?” Blount asked. “Do we want that to be the 21st century worker’s economy?” \nWant Philadelphia Travel news in your inbox?
