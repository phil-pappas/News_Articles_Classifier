Comment Posted Aug. 3, 2015 at 10:09 AM By The Oak Ridger Posted Aug. 3, 2015 at 10:09 AM Kevin Triplett, Tennessee Department of Tourist Development commissioner, has announced the addition of Anderson, Carter, Sumner and Unicoi counties to Retire Tennessee, the state’s retiree recruitment marketing program. Retire Tennessee promotes Tennessee as an ideal place for retirees to call home. According to a press release, the four counties join Cumberland, Franklin, Hamblen, Hamilton, Hardin, Jefferson, Loudon, Maury, Putnam, Rhea, Roane, Robertson, Sullivan, Warren and White counties as Retire Tennessee counties. Now in its ninth year, Retire Tennessee inspired more than 10,000 inquiries from potential retirees last year. Tennessee is one of only four states with retiree recruitment as a formal program and continues to gain momentum as a potential retirement destination for more than 78 million baby boomers, according to a news release. The Retire Tennessee program recognizes that many retirees begin as tourists, visiting a community three to five times before making a relocation decision. “We are excited for Anderson County to be a part of the state sponsored Retire Tennessee program,” said Anderson County Mayor Terry Frank in the release. “The exposure we receive through these marketing efforts by the Anderson County Tourism Council will be a boost to our local economy. Retire Tennessee is an important part of our organized effort to increase residential development in Anderson County and thereby increase our tax revenues and quality of life. Retirees add so much to the fabric of a community that this program is an all-around win.” Interest in Tennessee is reportedly up 22 percent compared to 7 percent eight years ago.
