Only the brilliant sky and the vivid pink geraniums by the door indicate that this is no photograph. Deep in the heart of Mangalem, the old city of Berat in Albania , Margarita invites us in. \n• Is Albania Europe's best-kept secret? \nThe room is cool and dark as I cross to look out the window. The houses tumble down to the river with its old and new bridges and bustling modern centre. The heat and city noise rise up but inside all is quiet and calm. Gradually my eyes become accustomed to the dim light. In the corners stand heavy pieces of furniture, no doubt inherited. Couches line the walls, leaving the centre of the room clear. \nI begin to distinguish images on the walls. Against a deep sea-green background are classical temples, boats, fishermen and islands picked out in grey, white and black. A frieze of fruits and leaves runs above and below. This mural runs around the room, portraying an ancient, peaceful landscape. Margarita explains that her house was occupied by Italians in 1942 and they painted the mural, but whether to while away the time, remind them of home or in gratitude for a comfortable billet she does not know. \nCandied walnuts are offered by the writer's Albanian companion (Photo: AP) \nWe are invited to question Margarita. She answers at length. In her youth her family was well-to-do but lost property and status under communism. Now 72, she has her home and some orchards. She supplements her income by making and selling preserves. Having left the room, she returns with a tray of her wares – jars of plum and apricot jam plus a mysterious dark jar in which black fruits can be seen. It turns out to be candied walnuts. \nMargarita explains the laborious process – the selection of nuts, the first stage of cooking and how each walnut is pricked with a needle to test if it is cooked. She shows us the sharp peeling knife and the tips of her fingers stained black from handling the nuts. The final stage is preparing the syrup and the actual candying process. Her passion and pride in her work shines through. \nSoon it is time to leave and continue on our journey through Albania. \nI summon up my few words of Albanian. “Thank you,” I say, “thank you, Margarita, and goodbye.” The response is a warm hug and a kiss. \nNow it seems like a dream, Margarita in her cool sea-green room, in the heart of the old town candying walnuts as generations have done before while modern life rushes on below.
