A swift, multi-million pound repair operation meant that it was soon back in business, and train travellers in that part of the world were once again able to enjoy a ride along one of the most spectacular routes in Britain. \nAndrew Gilligan, when he was on a three-day country bus ride along the South West coast of England, wrote of the journey from Exeter to Teignmouth : \"This is the one stretch you might consider doing by train. The bus is pleasant, but the railway journey, right by the Exe estuary then along the sea wall at Dawlish, is one of the best in Britain, with tunnels through cliffs and headlands and the waves at high tide breaking right over the tracks.\" \nNow, after last year's hiatus due to storms, people are again able to appreciate in full the wonders of the approach to Teignmouth (pictured above).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:12:36.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
