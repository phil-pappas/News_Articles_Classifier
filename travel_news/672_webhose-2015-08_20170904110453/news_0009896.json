This is an ideal fit with our unique ‘Team Melbourne’ approach of working with partners across the city to deliver the best possible conference experience,” said Karen Bolinger, CEO of Melbourne Convention Bureau. \nThe Victorian Government will be a sponsor of the conference, while the international group of delegates are expected to generate an estimated US$20.2 million economic boost for Victoria. \nAccording to John Eren, minister for Tourism and Major, delegates will be guaranteed an invigorating and engaging experience inside and outside the conference venue. \n“Melbourne … offers delegates the chance to experience its thriving and sophisticated food, wine, art and cultural scene during their visit. We look forward to welcoming the IDA meeting delegates in 2017 and sharing all that Melbourne and Victoria have to offer”, said Eren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T12:39:04.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
