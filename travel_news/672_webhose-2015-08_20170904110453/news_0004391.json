The lucky nominees across 14 categories will face a further round of judging before the winners are revealed at an awards ceremony later this year.Now aligned with the nationwide Scottish Thistle Awards, most category winners will go on to represent the region in the VisitScotland-backed national award scheme. \nACSTA chairman Iain Watson says, “The response we have had from across the tourism industry has been phenomenal this year. Narrowing down such a strong field to create the shortlists was a daunting task, but everyone involved in the judging is confident they have selected the very best we have to offer as a tourism sector. “Tourism operators all over the north east of Scotland have proved themselves to be providing exceptional services to visitors over the past 12 months, and this is directly represented by the variety of businesses that have made the shortlist. “Many operators who have won or been shortlisted in previous years have chosen to enter again this year, and have been vocal about the benefits of being involved with the awards scheme. It has also been encouraging to see even more new names entering this year. “From local one-man outfits to large multi-nationals, ACSTA is dedicated to promoting the best of the best and celebrating those who go above and beyond to create a magical experience for tourists visiting Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.” A number of past winners will look to hold on to their titles at this year’s ACSTA ceremony.
