(Disney Parks via AP) \nWalt Disney Co has planned to bring Star Wars from a galaxy far, far away to California and Florida in the form of two theme park expansions. \nOne of Disney's largest park expansions, the 14-acre (6-hectare) Star Wars lands at Anaheim, California's Disneyland and Orlando, Florida's Walt Disney World would introduce a new planet from the intergalactic film saga, the company said on Saturday. \nThe project would feature two new rides, including one where participants could take control of the Millennium Falcon spaceship, as well as the Cantina, the infamous hub of rogue smugglers and traders in the films. \nConstruction would begin at Disneyland in 2017, while a start date for Disney World was not set. Bob Chapek, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said that all the employees would be dressed as if they are characters in the Star Wars universe. (Mindy Schauer/ The Orange County Register via AP) Disney announced several other park upgrades at its annual D23 Expo, a fan convention, including an 11-acre (4.5-hectare) Toy Story land at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida. Disney did not comment on costs. \nThe company spent $1 billion to build a 12-acre (5-hectare) Cars Land that debuted at Disney's California Adventure park in 2012. It has planned to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai next year. \nThe announcement of Star Wars lands, made by Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, came as fans geared up for the December release of The Force Awakens, the opening film in a new Star Wars trilogy. The first Star Wars movie was released in 1977 and became embedded in pop culture.

I couldn't be happier,\" Ford told about 7,500 fans. \nDisney also showcased star talent to build buzz for other films. \nJohnny Depp swaggered through the hall dressed as his Pirates of the Caribbean character Captain Jack Sparrow, as fans were told that Orlando Bloom's character, Will Turner, would return for 2017's fifth instalment of the franchise, Dead Men Tell No Tales. \nNyong'o was joined by actor Ben Kingsley, newcomer Neel Sethi and director Jon Favreau for the upcoming computer-generated and live-action retelling of The Jungle Book.
