The millionaire ruckman-forward — who left a nightmare of pain on walking out of the Adelaide Football Club in 2012 — finally was playing against the Crows. For Sydney, not one of those two AFL clubs in his home state of Queensland.\nThey had only three minutes to wait to test their manners and etiquette at the SCG Saturday afternoon as Adelaide stepped into a damaging 52-point workover. Tippett was handed the ball at half-forward, he turned to find space and the opening to the goal at the Bradman end — and he kicked Sydney’s second goal.\nThey booed.\nAnd 11 minutes later they emptied their lungs again. And their souls of the heckling they have carried for three years with the memory of the fines and draft sanction Tippett’s dodgy $900,000 a-year contract and third-party deal. The one-time great hope of the Crows had kicked his second goal in less than 15 minutes.\nAlthough this time the jeering may have been about the free kick — quite legitimate actually — Tippett was handed after being held by Adelaide lead ruckman Sam Jacobs in a boundary throw-in contest.\nBy the 24th minute — as Tippett had his third goal and Sydney a defining 24-point lead — the despair with the most-controversial and most-expensive name in the Crows’ 25-season history was not about the past and that destructive defection at the end of 2012, but the scary present.\nAs a goalkicker — and the first ruckman to reach double figures with hit-outs in the match with his 10 to quarter-time — Tippett has affirmed his standing as the Swan the Crows fans least liked in this finals-shaping match, let alone history. Within 30 minutes (and regardless of the broken bone in his right hand) Tippett’s tap work was setting up the cutting midfield rushes that tore holes in the Adelaide defence.

Never more so than when Sydney’s other expensive buy, key forward Lance Franklin, pushed off attentive Adelaide key defender Daniel Talia — at times making him look like a rag doll — to match Tippett with three goals by half-time when the Swans led by 43.\nRather than boo, it was best for the Adelaide faithful to sit silently at the SCG and — like some of their Crows players — simply watch the Swans make a statement, both in football and social politics.\nAfter losing two consecutive games against top-four rivals West Coast and AFL premier Hawthorn in poor fashion, the Swans were always destined to respond while seeking to avoid three losses in a row for the first time since 2013.\nAnd then with their elder Adam Goodes being absent — after being heckled into an emotional strain by opposition supporters — the Swans were duty bound to make a statement on the field while their fans in the SCG terraces “stood as one” in favour of Goodes and against racism.\nHaving won a game — a Showdown a fortnight ago — on emotion, the Crows players are the last who would question the power of men on a crusade. As their late coach Phil Walsh would say, the Adelaide players walked into an ambush Saturday. Lance Franklin has shot on goal from a long way out.

The boos were strong and should echo to AFL House as an even stronger message on the failings of technology.\nCaptain Taylor Walker’s 100th AFL milestone left little to celebrate as Adelaide’s win-loss count became 9-7 and the prospect of a place in next month’s finals narrowed to needing probably four wins from the remaining five home-and-away games.\nTippett is on the path to playing AFL finals for the third consecutive season since leaving Adelaide.\nHe has no reason to boo his move “closer” to his Gold Coast home.\nSYDNEY 6.2 11.5 13.9 17.15 (117)\nADELAIDE 2.2 4.4 7.8 9.11 (65)\nBEST\nSydney: Hannebery, McVeigh, Rampe, Tippett, Kennedy, Mitchell, K.
