Cipriani wrote a magnanimous open letter after his fate was confirmed on Thursday. In truth, the writing was already on the wall after the fly half was granted a total of 48 minutes in the back-to-back warm-up games against France, both as a replacement full back. The 2015 Rugby World Cup begins in • England Rugby World Cup squad announcement: as it happened In the first match at Twickenham, he only touched the ball once as the French pack turned the screw. In Paris, he had far more of an impact scoring a try and adding a spark to a previously moribund back division. That sparkling cameo, however, was not enough to earn a place in the 31. “I think England will be poorer for his absence,” Diamond said. “Selection is difficult in these situations for the coaching staff, but I don’t think they gave him enough opportunity during the Six Nations and over the summer period. • Our writers' XVs for Fiji opener “Whenever he came from the bench, he has done fantastically well. If you want someone to come off the bench and have an impact then there is no better player. There are not many players who possess that game-changing ability. It is their decision but it looks to me like they have got it wrong. “Overall he has come from nowhere. He was not even on their radar last year and he has done fantastically well for us. He’s really positive. He is disappointed, but he is also in a good place.” Steffon Armitage, Toulon’s exiled flanker, also tweeted his sympathy for the fly half who was man of the match in his last start in an England shirt, an uncapped fixture against the Barbarians in May; his last Test start was seven years ago. Definitely think @DannyCipriani87 and @nick_easter deserved to be in the squad Danny for game changer and minty for leadership... — Steffon Armitage (@Magicsteffo7) August 27, 2015 Cipriani struck a considered tone in his letter. Though he made plain his frustration that he did not receive more time to make an impression, he accepted that after a long period in exile, his chances of earning a slot in the 31 were always remote. “A lot has been said and I just thought I’d clear up a few things. Things can be taken how you want but it is truly how I feel. I appreciate how hard selection is, there are so many boys that worked hard in camp and got less time than me so I feel fortunate to get the time that I didn't. I tried to do everything I could for the white shirt. \"There is [sic] a lot of class players in the squad and it was always going to be difficult. Of course I would have liked more time to state my case, and am very disappointed not to make the squad. I’ve worked hard and developed as a player in the last 10 weeks, and did all I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the camp and fully understand the route the coaches have gone down. “I wouldn’t be a true competitor if I said I agreed, as we all believe in ourselves. But I had along way to make up as the squad had been building since 2012. I’ve had open conversations with Stuart and the coaches the whole time and learnt a lot form them and enjoyed my time. It’s just the start of my journey. I’m going to stay fit and be ready if I’m called upon.” • Mick Cleary: Where are the game-breakers? The other big talking point around the squad selection was the inclusion of Sam Burgess, the rugby league convert, at the expense of Luther Burrell , who was the starting centre in the past two Six Nations. Certainly, it received the approval of film star Russell Crowe, who developed a close relationship with Burgess as the co-owner of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Showing scant regard for correct handles, Crowe tweeted: They did it @englishrugby made the competitive decision. Holy shit the @2015_RWC is on. — Russell Crowe (@russellcrowe) August 27, 2015 F**k me ... Lancaster you frigging champion . @AllBlacks take note. These boys are intending to win. @Wallabies it's the Poms ... natural — Russell Crowe (@russellcrowe) August 27, 2015 Recalling his own rapid promotion from league to union, World Cup winner Jason Robinson also voiced his support. Big congrats to @SamBurgess8 on his selection! Most said that I'd only make the bench but ended up making history!
