California's leadership in driving the nation's markets for zero-emission vehicles (pg. 30). Which strategies to build sustainable communities create the greatest reduction in driving (pg. 50). How California's fuel providers have met the requirements of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard thus far (pg. 75) and the cost-effectiveness of the policy (pg. 78). The costs and benefits of cutting the carbon intensity of our transportation fuels (pg. 77) and what is likely to be the key to the success of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (pg. 81). The possible gasoline price impacts of putting fuels under the AB 32 cap (pg.88), and the related emissions reductions (pg. 101). One key conclusion in the analysis is that the current policies are technologically feasible but limited incentives, unfunded mandates and other factors may create barriers to implementation. The report makes specific recommendations to address these barriers in order to achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals beyond 2020 (pg. 107) including:\nIncreasing certainty around emission reductions, fuel costs and overall travel costs by assessing policy price signals and their impact on consumer behavior. Supplying resources to support the implementation of the state's smart growth law, SB 375, and creating enforcement mechanisms. Designing policies with long-term reduction goals in mind. Seeking regulatory harmonization with other states that have adopted low carbon fuel standards and other carbon mitigation programs.

Noel Perry, founder of Next 10\nDr. Gustavo Collantes, assistant director of the UC Davis University of California, Davis Policy Institute for Energy, Environment and the Economy\nWHEN:\nAug. 25 – 31\nQuote: :\nCalifornia's leadership in creating a lower-emission transportation system is invaluable to other states and the nation because it creates a roadmap to a more efficient, lower emission system. The transformation of California's transportation system - which represents 40 percent of our GHG emissions - will depend heavily on technological innovation, as well as society's adoption of enhanced energy efficiency practices and policies that drive these elements. – F.
