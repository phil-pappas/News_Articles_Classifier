The son of Prince Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and grandson of King Mongkut (Rama IV) – immortalised on the big screen in 1956 by Yul Brynner in Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I – King Rama VI conceived the design of the palace, built raised from the ground on pillars and entirely made from teak wood, and with all the formal and informal rooms required by a modern early 20th century royal household.\nIts stunning architecture is unlike any other Thai palace – and there are many – with the king’s wishes fulfilled for a comfortable retreat with excellent ventilation. At the time, leading Italian architect Ercole Manfredi was hired to bring the king’s ideas to fruition.\nNostalgic ... Maruekhathaiyawan Palace, the royal family's old summer retreat in Hua Hin, Thailand. Source: Supplied\nWe’ve just walked the long wide second-level verandas of the summer palace and I can’t help but imagine, as we peek inside rooms decorated with a distinct Victorian flavour, how life had dramatically changed for the Thai royals of that era.\nKing Rama IV of Siam, as Thailand was known, had paved the way, famously, by engaging British teacher Anna Leonowens in the early 1860s as governess to his many children. The king had realised that Siam needed to engage with the rest of the world, which at that time meant the British powerhouse in Europe and the new Americas.\nIt’s a history lesson I’m wide-eyed about. But after walking the verandas and lawned garden grounds of the palace we, too, retreat to our own beachfront “summer palace’’, the Intercontinental Hua Hin Resort.\nPure luxury ... one of the suites at the Intercontinental Hua Hin Resort. Source: Supplied\nThis elegant resort lives up to the Intercontinental’s reputation for pristine luxury and service. Primely located in the heart of Hua Hin, the 119-room resort has a range of suites as well as three waterfront villas.\nThe stylish suites look towards the large central multi-pool recreational area, set in lush tropical gardens and lined with established fragrant white-bloom frangipanis.\nResort amenities include authentic Thai cuisine at Pirom restaurant, trattoria-style dining at Felicita and the waterfront Azure Beach Grill. Breakfast is a modern fusion of Thai and European choices, and the Club Continental lounge is a relaxing zone for breakfast, pre-dinner drinks and afternoon tea.\nI’m a sucker for a cooking class in the cuisine’s country of origin, so leapt at the chance to spend a morning with Pirom’s sous chef Worawut Samngamkai, who patiently shared his skills and tips to make Thai classics Tom Kha Gai (chicken in coconut soup), Yum Talay (spicy seafood salad) and all-time favourite Pad Thai. Of course, each delicious dish consumed as prepared.\nClassic favourite ... Pad Thai made at a cooking class at the Intercontinental Hua Hin. Source: Supplied\nWe also took advantage of the Intercontinental’s well-appointed resort gym and visited the spa for a signature traditional Thai massage – my first-ever – that uses no oils or lotions and is based on an ancient healing system in which your body is compressed and pulled, stretched and rocked into a state of absolute, blissful relaxation. Continuing this theme, a yoga class for two was so instructive that I had to back up the next morning for the daily group yoga class on the lawn.\nA dawn stroll beachside brings Hua Hin’s rich culture to you – Buddhist monks in orange robes on the move with their bowls to accept gifts of food, and the small multicoloured fishing boats making their way to shore with the night’s catch.\nCatches of the day ... fishermen on the pier at Hua Hin. Source: News Corp Australia\nIt’s the fishing boats that are key to how the ebb and flow of life in Hua Hin all began. While the beachside town is a popular weekend getaway for Bangkok-siders – hence hotels and apartments and commercial offshoots popping up – fishermen still go about their centuries-old trade, mooring their colourful boats in the canals then sailing out to the ocean at high tide each night to make their catch. At dusk, look out to the ocean from the resort poolside and the vibrant vessels are lined up by the dozen, their green beacons glowing to attract their watery prey.\nThe next day we passed through the original fishing village on our way to visit Wat Khao Lad temple atop Chopstick Hill, also known as Monkey Mountain. The simple temple above a 20m tall Lord Buddha has panoramic views over Khao Takiab beach and is home to a small monastery whose monks live in harmony with hundreds of monkeys.\nEvergreen hills ... the beautiful vista of the Hua Hin Hills Winery. Source: Supplied\nNext we headed into the hills of Hua Hin for an unexpected find – Hua Hin Hills Vineyard and their surprisingly quaffable Monsoon Valley Wine. Who would have thought Thailand has a burgeoning wine industry? I was later told the guy who owns Red Bull is behind the innovative award-winning winery, where vines are grown over a couple of hundred hectares in a parklike garden setting with a modern and stylish restaurant overlooking the panorama. Elephants walk the avenues dividing the vines (yes, we enjoyed the rhythmic ride).\nLunch was modern Thai enjoyed with a refreshing white shiraz that was just as good as many a drop enjoyed in Provence. The winemaker has a pedigree that hails from New Zealand and Italy, hence some lovely reds and a gorgeous muscat, too.\nFour days was not long enough in Hua Hin. One more stop before heading home – Hua Hin Railway Station, regarded as one of the country’s most beautiful train stations, and also built during the reign of the rather innovative King Rama VI.\nOh, and one more stop, a gem shop, where Thai sapphires and gold beckoned ... but that’s another story.\nGo2\nHUA HIN\nGETTING THERE\nWe flew into Bangkok and were met by a pre-booked Siam Resorts Limousines (limousine.in.th), for a three-hour car transfer to the Intercontinental Hua Hin Resort, at a cost of 3000 baht or about $120. The resort organised a car for our return trip to Bangkok, at slightly less cost.\nSTAYING THERE\nIntercontinental Hua Hin, 33/33 Petchkasem Rd, Hua Hin.
