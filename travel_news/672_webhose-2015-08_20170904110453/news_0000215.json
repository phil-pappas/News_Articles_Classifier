Egypt came second with 22%, Turkey third at 19%, Greece 17% and Spain at 16%. \nAlistair Daly, chief marketing officer at On the Beach, said: “Spain is dominating the late deals market, however other popular destinations such as Cyprus, Egypt and Turkey are proving more popular than last year. For people looking for a great value last minute holiday, Turkey offers the best deals.” \n“Holidaymakers have clearly had enough of the appalling British summer and are jetting off to warmer climes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:12:23.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
