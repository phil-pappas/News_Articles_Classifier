As The Times rightly points out, the firearms carnage is unacceptable and perhaps, ultimately, unsustainable.\nThe Times states that “this isn’t a lost cause,” but deftly avoided the gorilla in the room. Until it is confronted in a meaningful way, nothing much will get measurably better. I refer to the National Rifle Association. It not only manages to block or confound any sane firearm restrictions, it is now suing the city of Seattle regarding the ammunition tax.\nI understand the NRA is a very deep-pocketed lobbying organization, and, as such, a formidable foe. It appears that a lack of vigorous pushback is mainly due to the reluctance, or cowardice, of our elected representatives.\nI’d hate to think that we live in a country that loves its firearms and has just gotten used to the increasing death toll.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time Henry Thompson, Seattle\nLetters editor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:44:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
