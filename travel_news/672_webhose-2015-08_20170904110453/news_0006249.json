(Atul Kasbekar Facebook) \nHe makes ordinary faces look extraordinary. Undoubtedly, Atul Kasbekar is one of the leading fashion photographers in the country today. \n\"I enjoy clicking people and can certainly make them look good,\" he smiles. \nKasbekar, who has shot the who's who of the fashion and film industry, says he loves clicking Malaika Arora Khan as \"no one uses the camera like her\". \nAtul Kasbekar has been associated with the Kingfisher Calendar since its inception. He is predominantly known for his calendar shoots. (kingfishercalendar.com) \nHT spoke to the ace photographer who is making his foray into Bollywood as a producer and also juggling a TV show, managing a celeb management company and photography assignments. \nPhoto courtesy: (kingfishercalendar.com) \nExcerpts of the interview: \nWhat's the best thing about being a fashion photographer? How does it feel making people famous? (Smiles) The best thing about photography is that no two days are the same. Even if you have shot the same person a hundred times, it's always different the 101st time. For someone like me, who gets bored easily, there is always something new to do. \nHow difficult is it to make someone look beautiful in photos? If you are creative and like beautiful things it helps. Not to forget practice makes your art perfect. It's also important that you enjoy what you do. This profession is driven by passion. Your confidence in the craft matters. \nPhoto courtesy: (kingfishercalendar.com) \nWhen are you most comfortable, behind or in front of the camera? A part of my job makes it essential that I face the camera, as I judge talent hunts, do television shows and advertisements. So now I have a fair amount of practice in it. (Laughs) However, I prefer being behind the camera --though I'm not uncomfortable facing it. \nDo you think digital cameras have made taking photographs easier? I think there is a certain democratisation that has come in. Now, anyone can take an ordinary picture and make it look much better. I know how magical Photoshop is; I have seen how an average shot can be made to look like a million bucks. The art of clicking photographs has evolved and it is not just about pressing the button but what you do after that. \nPhoto courtesy: (kingfishercalendar.com) \nYou are currently judging a show which is on the hunt for the next super model. What are the things that you are looking at in your contestants? I feel what is happening in the modeling industry shouldn't be happening. There was a time when there were super models who concentrated only on modeling, they were not gearing up to step into Bollywood. I am talking about Mehr Jesia, Milind Soman, Rahul Dev, Marc Robinson, Sheetal Mallar, Arjun Rampal etc. The glory days of the super model seem to be over. So when Akash (Sharma, executive producer of the show) approached me, I said yes hoping that a contest like this will give the opportunity to create stars in the modeling world. \nTell us about your future projects. I am looking forward to the release of my first Bollywood production. The film, directed by Ram Madhwani, is based on the life of Neerja Banot. Sonam (Kapoor) is playing the lead and Shabana Azmi is playing her mother. I had brought the rights two years back and now the film is in the post-production stage. I am enjoying being a producer and at present discussing three-four film projects. Given my love for multi-tasking, I am also busy with my photography assignments along with taking care of my celeb management company. \nPhoto courtesy: (kingfishercalendar.com) \nWhat would you like to explore other than fashion photography? I would love to do a bunch of portraits. I have completed two decades in this profession. I have always loved studying and shooting faces. I would love to do serious portraiture, which will be creatively satisfying. I feel each face has a character; every line has a story. It's a challenge to make real/normal people look comfortable in front of the camera. I really like the series called Humans of New York but my portraiture idea isn't inspired by it. \nHow do you make time for yourself and family? I am very good at time management. I wake up at 7 am irrespective of the time I go to bed. I then go to the gym. I start early at office and as Bollywood wakes up late, I take care of those assignments later in the day. I hardly socialise now, which saves time. I love watching football on TV or at a stadium.
