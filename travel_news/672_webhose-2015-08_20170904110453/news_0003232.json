The inaugural London International Antique Doll Teddy Bear and Toy Fair, taking place next year on 20 November, will bring antique doll and dealers, experts, collections and talks; the opportunity to buy rare toys at the venue’s ornate Corinthian pillared hall space. \nThe one day show will be opened by Bunny Campione; familiar to many from her appearances over the last 20 years on the BBC Antiques Roadshow. Bunny is an international renowned expert on dolls, dolls' houses and soft toys; having spent her career at Sotheby's and Christie's. The event will attract major dealers and collectors from all over the world including Sue Pearson - bears, David Pressland - tinplate toys, Eric Petit - bears from France and Rachel Gotch - dolls. Passionate investors from countries such as Japan, Germany and the USA, where some of the highest prices have been paid for antique dolls, toys and teddy bears, are expected to make the journey to Olympia London to peruse the finest toys to expand their collections. Visitors who want to see the exhibits, from affordable to thousands of pounds, will be able to explore the show for just £5. Organisers, Daniel Agnew and Hilary Pauley said: “We're delighted to be bringing the first London International Antique Doll, Teddy Bear and Toy Fair, to Olympia’s Pillar Hall. It’s a beautiful, enchanting space right in the middle of west London and couldn’t be better placed for international visitors to reach as well as providing a charming antique setting for the exhibition.” Nick Graham, Head of Sales at Olympia London said: “We host a plethora of events at Olympia London and are able to offer a range of spaces to suit their needs. The Pillar Hall, which is our smallest events space and one of our most special, will look wonderful filled with these amazing artefacts from toy history.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T18:51:46.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
