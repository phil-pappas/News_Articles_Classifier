The partnership will see Air Seychelles place its “HM” flight code on Air France's domestic flights between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and six of the largest cities in France: Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nice and Toulouse. In addition the agreement will extend Air France's European services between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Athens, Berlin, Dublin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Manchester, Munich and Zurich. Altogether, Air Seychelles will codeshare on 157 weekly domestic and regional flights. This, combined with its codeshare service to Abu Dhabi with its partner Etihad Airways, provides unparalleled global access to the Seychelles. Air France will, in turn, codeshare on Air Seychelles' three-per-week non-stop service between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Seychelles, and on domestic flights between Mahé and Praslin, the second-biggest island in the archipelago and home of the famous Vallée de Mai nature reserve. In total, the French flag carrier will see its “AF” code appear on 18 weekly flights operated by Air Seychelles. Codeshare flights can be booked from 19 August, for travel as from 21 August 2015. Mr Gagey said: \"Air France welcomes this partnership with Air Seychelles, which provides our customers with new travel opportunities to the popular island group and underlines our commitment to strengthening air connectivity in the Indian Ocean region”.
