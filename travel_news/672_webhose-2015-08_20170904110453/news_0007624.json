Among this roster are Fortune 1000 companies, including Google, who are allowing employees to benefit from Airbnb’s wide range of accommodations available in more than 190 countries. \n\"We were particularly impressed that Airbnb’s new Business Travel product suite allows you to uncover unique locations for temporary housing, team offsites and conventions where there is an opportunity to build closer working relationships by sharing accommodations in a casual and friendly environment. Like Box, Airbnb is making it easier for business users on the go and we're looking forward to trying out the product and expanding our relationship,\" said Jeff Mannie, VP, Controller and CAO at Box. \n“The corporate community’s response to our Business Travel program has been staggering and confirms our findings that business travelers increasingly want to redefine the business trip,” said Marc McCabe, Business Travel Lead, Airbnb. “The average business travel stay on Airbnb is 6.8 days, which shows how customers are looking for a mix of business and leisure, and often adding a weekend to explore a new destination.” \nAirbnb for Business helps companies of all sizes cater to their employees’ diverse travel needs. The program allows business travelers to directly book Airbnb accommodations and automatically expense them back to their employers.
