Toronto is a work of art! Details Created   12:00 Repainting entire streets with an obscure colour scheme A unique creative spirit thrives in cosmopolitan Toronto. Set against a backdrop of stunning architecture, and inspired by Toronto’s eclectic culture, world-renowned festivals, events and spaces celebrate the arts, theatre and the city’s heritage. With an increase in importance and size, diversity, commercial galleries, artist-run centres, artist collectives, institutions, and a number of artists living and working in the city – Toronto is a work of art!The Toronto art scene flourishes in the most unexpected places, neighbourhoods and celebrated events. \nArt Unexpected Public Art Toronto’s percentage for art bylaw requires that 1% of all construction costs be set aside for public art. Located throughout Toronto, are more than 200 City-owned pieces of public art and historical monuments. Situated in city parks, and on the grounds of municipal buildings, these works add both a historic and artistic element to the urban landscape. They are diverse in medium, ranging from bronze and masonry sculptures, to aluminum, polyester resin, stainless steel and concrete. The earliest piece in the collection, The Canadian Volunteers Memorial, dates back to 1870. Underground Parts of the Toronto underground double as art galleries. Take a moment to explore, and you'll find intricate glass mosaics, angular aluminium sculptures, even optical illusions etched into the walls of 75 per cent of the transit system’s stations. Graffiti Alley Tucked in the Rush Lane just south of Queen Street West near Bathurst Street is arguably the city’s most celebrated area for graffiti art (about a kilometre of space). Every nook of this strip houses some new and exciting pieces. Art Neighbourhoods For Toronto art, the biggest story is not any single artist, curator or gallery, but a neighbourhood. Many Toronto neighbourhoods are chock-full of art galleries filled with pieces by an array of Canadian and international artists. Junction Triangle/Bloordale/Dupont Many of the biggest names in Toronto's contemporary art scene are flocking to this formerly industrial area largely due to the more affordable rents. Already here are Arsenal, Daniel Faria, Scrap Metal, Katzman Contemporary, Clint Roenisch and Gallery TPW. And, Cooper Cole opened its new Dupont Street space in July. Neubacher Shor and Angell Gallery are also in the midst of moving in; the latter opens its first Dupont Street exhibition on September 11. Erin Stump Projects is here too and soon MOCCA will have a permanent home at the Tower Automotive Building on Sterling Road. West Queen West Despite the mass exodus of galleries, this changing neighbourhood still boasts prominent names in Toronto's visual arts scene including Katharine Mulherin and the photography-focused Stephen Bulger. If you venture off Queen Street, you'll find a variety of spaces including the Koffler Gallery inside the Artscape Youngplace on Shaw, Pari Nadimi Gallery on Niagara and regular exhibitions that pop up at The Drake hotel and the Gladstone hotel. Yorkville Yorkville is home to numerous galleries that generally cater to serious collectors. However, this neighbourhood was once a bohemian enclave back in the 1960s. Its artsy roots are still showing thanks to the Yorkville institution (it opened in 1962) Mira Godard Gallery as well as Liss Gallery, Odon Wagner, Gallery Gevik, Gallery One, Leonardo Galleries and Loch Gallery. Dundas West A variety of galleries populate this stretch of Dundas and they include those that cater to emerging artists as well as venerable Toronto institutions. Art Metropole, for instance, moved into the area three years ago to carry on its 41-year legacy as an artist-run centre. Ontario College of Art and Design’s independent gallery XSPACE is here, as is Loop Gallery and LE Gallery. Distillery District Its cobblestone streets are usually filled with tourists marvelling at the largest collection of Victorian industrial architecture in North America. Noteworthy is the Thompson Landry Gallery, the massive Corkin Gallery and Julie M. Gallery, which focuses on showing contemporary Israeli, Canadian and North American art.
