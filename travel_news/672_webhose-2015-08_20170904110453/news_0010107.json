New members can join Ram Nation at ramtrucks.com/ramnation .\n\"Ram truck owners have a strong sense of community and have the knowhow, skillset and willingness to give back,\" said Bob Hegbloom , President and CEO – Ram Truck Brand, FCA US LLC. \"They often are the go-to people that others can rely on when help is needed and, for them, the most satisfying reward or glory comes from feeling the pride of accomplishment through hard work.\n\"Ram Nation will make it easier for our owners and dealers to come together. We'd love to see this grassroots effort grow into a movement that will help people in need across America,\" Hegbloom added.\nThe idea for Ram Nation was sparked after the devastating 2012 Joplin, Mo. , tornado. When disaster struck that community, Ram truck owners showed up with their trucks and asked how they could help. The brand looked at how it could foster this emotion in its customer base to help out on a broader scale.\nRam Nation, Ram brand and dealer volunteers answered the call again this spring, converging on flood-stricken central Texas to join the First Response Team of America (FRTOA) in recovery and relief efforts. A $100,000 Ram Truck and FCA Foundation donation to FRTOA helped the Texas communities of Wimberley and San Marcos , and will provide aid in the event of future disasters.\nRam has partnered with and supported the First Response Team of America, founded by Tad Agoglia , since 2012 when it teamed up with The Weather Channel for exclusive \"Responding by Storm\" reports chronicling the organization's disaster recovery work following 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. Ram has provided Ram 2500, 3500 and 5500 trucks to First Response, and the brand and FCA Foundation have donated more than $300,000 to the organization to help with its ongoing relief efforts. The towing, hauling and off-road capability of the Ram trucks provided immediate benefit to the First Response Team's efforts in moving supplies and equipment and removing debris.\nHOW RAM NATION WORKS\nTruck owners interested in answering future calls to help, whether its mobilizing volunteers to assist in disaster relief efforts or proactive community outreach initiatives, can sign up for Ram Nation at ramtrucks.com/ramnation .\nRam Truck and its dealers will access the Ram Nation database to bring volunteers and organizations together when a need or opportunity arises.\nTypes of Ram Nation projects could include working with the First Response Team of America or other organizations in times of disasters across America and working with community nonprofit organizations on initiatives such as planting or harvesting crops for local food banks, collecting and delivering supplies, clearing debris or transporting people.\nAbout Ram Truck Brand\nSince its launch as a stand-alone division in 2009, the Ram Truck Brand has steadily emerged as an industry leader with one goal: to build the best pickup trucks and commercial vehicles in the industry.\nCreating a distinct identity for Ram Trucks has allowed the brand to concentrate on core customers and features they find valuable.
