The show features nearly 300 artifacts, most of them discovered in the underwater excavations of French marine archaeologist Frank Goddio.\nGoddio oversaw the raising of statues of the Egyptian gods Osiris and Isis, and a hulking slab, known as a stele, that sat at the front of a temple. The statues are both nearly 20 feet (6 metres) tall and weigh 4-5 tons each. The stele is also 20 feet tall and weighs nearly 16 tons. The Maritime Museum of Alexandria normally houses the three artifacts.\nGoddio and his team discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient cities of Thonis-Heracleion in 2000 and Canopus in 1997.\nThe cities sank into what is now Aboukir Bay, a part of the Mediterranean Sea just off the coast of Alexandria, in the 8th century following a series of cataclysmic natural disasters.\nThe cities remained the stuff of legend until Goddio and the European Institute of Underwater Archaeology (IEASM) uncovered them with support of the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities and the Hilti Foundation.\nMany of the artifacts going on display this fall are leaving Egypt for the first time, Goddio said. He remembered the discovery of the Osiris and Isis statues as \"absolutely a superb instant.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T05:02:24.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
