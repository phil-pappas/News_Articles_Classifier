In an interview today, Jim Clark , president of Local 357, which represents some 2,200 Republic pilots, sounded calm, composed and ready for whatever awaits. Like the thousands of Republic Airways (NASDAQ: RJET) pilots he represents, Clark can't be certain what will be in the tentative contract Republic Airways management plans to present to him and members of Local 357's negotiating team when they meet face to face Thursday afternoon in Washington, D.C. But Clark does have some idea what to expect. The Republic captain indicated there have been several meetings in recent months between Local 357 representatives and Republic's negotiating team. What Clark termed a \"comprehensive proposal\" was shown to Local 357 negotiators in early June. But there have been more meetings between the two sides since then, and Clark said he assumes the tentative contract to be revealed tomorrow will include more changes in the document seen in early June. But will the changes be enough to get a deal? On that point, Clark declined to speculate. Still the head of the Republic pilots union — which includes 350 pilots domiciled in Chicago who operate regional flights out of O'Hare International Airport for United Express, American Eagle and Delta Connection — said the way in which management has framed this tentative contract may hint at what's to come. \"The fact that Republic is calling this its 'last, best and final offer' may mean we have to present it to our rank and file members to vote on,\" explained Clark, who wouldn't predict the outcome of such a vote, having not yet seen what will be in Republic's proposal tomorrow. But Clark did suggest that Republic may be forcing the contract issue now because Local 357 members have not voted on a new contract since 2003, when the pilots' current contract with Republic was ratified. Clark estimated that only around 400 pilots now working for Republic were with the airline when that last contract was ratified. Newer employees, Clark suggested, might be somewhat more inclined to vote in favor of whatever Republic presents to the union tomorrow. Whether or not rank and file do vote, Clark indicated a strike isn't in the immediate cards. For that to happen, a federal mediator working with both sides has to release them, and Clark doesn't think that will happen anytime soon. Still, after eight years of negotiating to get a new contract with Republic Airways , Local 357's core issues of better pay and upgraded work rules haven't changed, Clark said. So it's on to tomorrow's big contract reveal. \nWant Chicago Travel   Industries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T00:12:01.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
