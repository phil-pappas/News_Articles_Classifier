When booking, travelers want information and options that make getting from where they are to where they’re going as fast, easy and affordable as possible. At the airport, the hassle of security, baggage check and potential delays and cancellations leave travelers stressed and eager for more convenient options and additional flight information. While boarding and flying, travelers are eager for more connectivity and a better in-flight experience – even if they have to pay more. And when they arrive, travelers expect providers to continue offering services that improve the travel experience – from deplaning to baggage claim and beyond. Airlines and airports continue to make billions in ancillary revenue each year from non-ticketed items. “As expectations rise, technology improves and travelers look far-and-wide for ways to enhance and ease their all-around travel experiences, new opportunities are emerging for airlines and airports to make even more money,” said the report.\nWhile airlines have long profited off of flight-specific ancillary services like early boarding, Wi-Fi, baggage and premium seating, airlines and airports have a massive opportunity to offer even more ancillary services to travelers before they even board the plane.\nNearly 60 percent of travelers surveyed would be willing to pay for premium services during their travel experiences. Services they are willing to pay for include:\n53 percent want an RFID tag on their bags to track the location of luggage in real-time; 40 percent want the ability to temporarily check luggage at the gate in order to shop and dine more freely; 37 percent want priority baggage claim 35 percent want curbside rental car pickup 26 percent want flight status alerts automatically sent to family, work, hotel, ground transport and other relevant parties; and 18 percent want the ability to pre-order food and drinks at airport restaurants and cafes via mobile. When it comes to the inflight experience, one of every two travelers is willing to pay for premium amenities and services, said the report, including:\n64 percent wanting high-performance WiFi with streaming capability; 50 percent want in-seat charging station for electronics ; 31 percent want texting capabilities; and 22 percent want early deplaning privileges. Concession , restaurant and retail sales are an important revenue stream for airports, and they could be bringing in even more money, says the report. According to FlightView, 86 percent of travelers said that they regularly shop, dine and drink at the airport before boarding their plane. But how much each traveler shops, eats and ultimately spends is highly dependent on how much time he or she has before takeoff.\nThe FlightView survey found there are three improvements airports can make to increase the likelihood that a traveler will spend money at the airport:\n1. Expediting security lines (51%).\n2. More consistently sending mobile flight status notifications (46%).\n3. Providing a clearer picture of exactly when a traveler’s plane will arrive at the gate (42%).\nFor airports and airlines, trying to meet those needs while offering a travel experience that’s as seamless, efficient and enjoyable as possible can be challenging. But there’s a lot to gain for the airports and airlines able to figure it out.\nFlightView, SITA and others have proven that happy and informed travelers spend more and are more likely to be loyal, repeat customers. As the travel experience continues to evolve, it’s critical that airports and airlines keep a finger on the pulse of their customers – and deeply understand what travelers need, expect and value, and where they would be willing to pay more.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Please follow my travel-related magazines on Flipboard: Best of About Travel , a joint curation venture with my fellow About Travel Experts; and Travel-Go!
