It's freer, rawer and, some say, even more of a thrill than regular skiing. If you're looking at last minute ski deals to the Alps, why not add this to your list of must-trys while you're there? \nMany of the great last minute ski deals available are to resorts where you can cross-country ski straight into the mountains. You don’t need to be an expert, either – this variation on the popular sport is good for beginners and advanced skiers alike. \nOf course, it all depends on finding the best resort to start from, or make your base. While many resorts are suitable for a cross-country adventure, here are three of the best to consider. \nThe Three Valleys: Courchevel \nEveryone loves the range of last minute ski deals to Courchevel. With a reputation for being one of the best Alpine ski resorts, it’s popular with skiers, snowboarders and anyone up for a fun winter holiday. \nComprising of four villages on different levels, Courchevel 1850 is a great place to start cross-country skiing through the Three Valleys and beyond.

In fact, whatever type of pace you’re looking for, you’ll certainly find it here. Want a leisurely excursion through the forests all the way to La Tania? Not a problem. Want to speed ski from higher up and get to Meribel? There’s a trail for you! \nEspace Killy: Val D’Isere \nThis region includes both Tignes and Val d'Isere, boasting around 300 km of skiing, 97 lifts and high-altitudes to almost 3,500m. That's why getting last minute ski deals to this resort is like winning the lottery for many avid skiers. \nFor cross-country skiing enthusiasts, Val d’Isere is a great base for exploring the area, with 21 km of tracks and trails offering different routes and adventures. Take leisurely runs to the banks of the Ouliette Lake, or begin with some sensational off-piste skiing then relax with some beautiful scenery in La Daille and the far end of Manchet Valley.
