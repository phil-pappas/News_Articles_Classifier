Commencing December 19, 2015, the flights will operate weekly on Saturdays through April 30, 2016. \nThe schedule for these flights is as follows- \nFlight Depart Arrive \nUA 1925 EWR 9:00am SKB 2:10pm UA 1925 SKB 3:05pm EWR 6:35pm \nUnited will utilize a 737-800 aircraft with capacity ranging from 154 to 166 seats for these flights. These flights will complement existing non-stop airlift into St. Kitts from North America, providing more convenient options for travelers to get to St. Kitts during the peak winter travel season. \n“The launch of this new service from United is very significant for St. Kitts, particularly as many of our new hotel developments including Belle Mont Farm at Kittitian Hill, Park Hyatt St. Kitts at Christophe Harbour, Koi Resort & Residences and Embassy Suites by Hilton St. Kitts are open or opening within the next few years,” said the Hon. Minister of Tourism, International Trade, Industry and Commerce Mr. Lindsay F.P. Grant. “To support the growth in available room stock, a simultaneous growth of our airlift is required. The Northeastern U.S. has historically been our largest source market for visitors, and these new flights also allow for more connections from key gateways in and near this region.” \nThe Hon. Mark Brantley, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Aviation for St. Kitts & Nevis and Deputy Premier of Nevis stated, “We welcome the United Airlines flight from Newark as an integral component of our strategy to provide non-stop airlift from our key international gateways. Our visitor research and stakeholder input have indicated that New Jersey is a very strong market for the Federation and for Nevis, in particular.” \nUnited is the U.S. airline with the most comprehensive global route network, and the new service provides additional connections from St. Kitts’ top feeder gateways including: Washington D.C.’s Reagan National Airport (DCA) and Dulles International Airport (IAD); Baltimore/Washington International Airport (IAD); Boston Logan International Airport (BOS); and Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD). United actively maintains and specifically operates an early departure from Chicago into Newark to support traffic into Caribbean destinations. \n“We’re excited to offer new service into St. Kitts from our world-class Newark hub,” said Director of Leisure Sales for United Airlines, Vic Kerckhoff. “This addition will mark United’s 18th Caribbean destination from our domestic airports, offering more flexibility and choice for flyers traveling to the region.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:40:25.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
