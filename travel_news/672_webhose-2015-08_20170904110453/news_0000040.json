Won a chance to buy SEPTA's special Pope Francis one-day Regional Rail passes, but forgot to make the actual purchase before the deadline ended? Well now you have a few more hours to secure the transit pass. SEPTA announced Sunday afternoon that it was extended the deadline to complete the transaction to 3 p.m. Monday. The sales were originally set to close at 11:59 p.m. Sunday. Battleship New Jersey bunks available for Pope Francis visit The change comes less than a week after SEPTA reported lower demand for the train passes than initially expected. High traffic volume crashed the transit agency's e-commerce site when it first opened sales of the papal pass, leading to the implementation of the lottery system . There are 350,000 passes, or 175,000 per day, for use on the Regional Rail lines during the Sept. 26-27 weekend. Lottery entrants requests only 328,045 special passes, meaning SEPTA is preparing to sell the nearly 22,000 unclaimed passes at its train stations later this week. That sale will commence after a second round of email notifications goes out Monday night through Tuesday to the lottery entrants who, last week, did not receive an email, which included a link to buy the pass, according to SEPTA officials. The transit agency also confirmed last week that it will use a lottery system to sell passes for the Norristown High Speed Line, and the 101 and 102 trolley routes . Interested passengers have from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 12 to enter that lottery. \nWant Philadelphia Travel   Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T15:39:07.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
