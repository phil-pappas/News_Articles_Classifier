Seolleongtang, Seoul \nSeoul has been incorporating regional dishes into its local menu for as long as it's been a center of culture and commerce in Korea. \nCase in point: Seoul may not have invented bibimbap, but it's crawling with bibimbap restaurants. \nOne undeniably local food is seolleongtang, a murky, off-white ox bone soup that's hearty and filling for all of its thin, almost-watery consistency. \nSeolleongtang began as part of a spring ritual in the Joseon Dynasty to honor farming. \nPart of the ceremony involved slaughtering a cow as a sacrifice to Dangun (founder of Korea's first kingdom) and making it into a soup. \nUpon observing the ceremony, King Seongjong ordered that the cow be cooked more efficiently, in order to feed the most people with the least amount of food. \nThus seolleongtang was created to yield maximum flavor with the minimum of meat. \nThis satisfying soup might explain how Koreans have put up with Seoul's punishing winters in recent years -- when eaten with rice, the lack of actual meat in the soup isn't a problem. \nWith seolleongtang, it's all about the broth. \nThe deep, full flavor comes from the ox bone, which is cooked in the soup for 10-odd hours. \nThe pale, white-ish color comes from the ox bone marrow. \nTry it at: Byeolcheonji Seolnongtang, 161-8 Donggyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul; +82 2 338 9966 \n2. Uijeongbu budaejjigae, Gyeonggi Province \nBuddaejjigae, literally \"army base stew,\" has its roots in the Korean War, when hungry chefs had to be creative with their limited resources. \nThey'd cook stews from U.S. Army base leftovers like hot dog sausages, Spam and American cheese, adding Korean ingredients such as dropwort, ddeok, ramyeon noodles, kimchi and condiments like gochujang to create a spicy fusion sensation. \nBuddaejjigae is sometimes referred to as \"Johnson tang,\" tang being the Korean word for stew. \nAccording to the book \"About Korea's Representative Foods,\" it's named for U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who's said to have raved about the taste during a visit to Korea. \nBuddaejjigade spread especially rapidly in Uijeongbu, which had a high concentration of U.S. Army bases. \nToday there's a \"buddaejjigae\" street (Gyeonggi-do Uijeongbu-si Uijeongbu1-dong) in Uijeongbu with a high concentration of buddaejjigae restaurants. \n3.
