Either side is miles of sand and the Artola Dunes to play on.\n 2 Next Barmy for Bali! The England Rugby Captain is rejuvenated by... Breathtaking Britain: Lake District named UK's most... 'Welcome t***': Premier Inn guest demands apology from... Behind the bay there’s a small, picturesque marina with luxurious yachts, bars, restaurants and – most interestingly for us – always a school of fish to admire.\nWe spent three weeks at Camping Cabopino after travelling 15,000 miles around Britain, Morocco and Spain in a Swift Escape 696 motorhome.\nDesigned with young families like ours in mind with a bunk bed at the back, it has proved ideal for our adventures.\nDavid Hurst's sons, Darley (on the left in blue trousers) and Daniel (on the right in green trousers)\nOur odyssey is still continuing – and has taken in dozens of fascinating places, as diverse as Stonehenge, Bath, Bletchley Park, Granada’s Alhambra Palace and the city’s Science Park.\nDuring several months of travels so far we’ve stayed at more than 50 campsites: one phone call before we set off to The Camping & Caravanning Club and we had our Brittany Ferries’ Portsmouth to Santander return ferry trip (from which we spotted dolphins and a minke whale) plus every campsite booked all the way across Spain – right to Camping Cabopino.\nDespite being a large campsite with 270 pitches and 60 chalets, it’s family-run and just about the friendliest site we stayed on.\nWhen we were there, our fellow campers were mostly northern European winter-sunners approaching the end of six-month stays.\nIn the evenings, we would join gatherings by motorhomes and, while our boys played with other children, we watched the setting sun’s orange glow across the bay.\nThen a peaceful night’s sleep before waking up to birdsong – and more coffee.\nTRAVEL FACTS Brittany Ferries offers return fares to Santander for two adults and a car with cabin from £488 on Brittany Ferries économie (no-frills). On its cruise-ferry service, prices start at £588.\nbrittanyferries.co.uk 0871 244 1400\nFor further information about camping stays in Britain and Spain, including Camping Cabopino, www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk\nRead more: Welcome to The Club - The Camping and Caravanning Club Cross Channel Ferries to France & Spain - Brittany Ferries", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1DZW5Fd", "http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/", "http://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-08-02T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:15:02.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
