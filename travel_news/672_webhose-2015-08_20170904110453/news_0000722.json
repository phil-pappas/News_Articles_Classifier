PUBLISHED: 04:01, Fri, Aug 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:10, Fri, Aug 14, 2015 GETTY Grenada is one of the most unspoilt of the Caribbean islands \nImagine the perfect tropical scene and you are picturing Grenada, one of the most unspoilt of the Caribbean islands where even the odd rain shower is known as liquid sunshine by locals. \nGetting around this 133-square mile island is easy, too. Less than an hour after touching down at Maurice Bishop airport, we are lazing on a hammock under a palm tree, drink in hand, with the azure ocean lapping nearby and the fragrant scent of frangipani on the breeze. \nWe are staying at the Sandals LaSource Resort, tucked away on the wonderfully named Pink Gin Beach – its own private stretch of sand – on the south-west tip of the island. \nThe renovated resort reopened last year after Sandals put its own quality stamp on it by adding two new villages, luxurious suites – some with infinity pools – and several new restaurants, including a sushi bar and a hot-dog stand. \nWith two swimming pools and a host of activities to choose from, including sailing, yoga and tennis, we decide we could quite happily stay at the resort for a week without getting bored. \nThe first few days of our holiday consist of a gruelling schedule that goes along the lines of coffee on our balcony, eggs cooked by the legendary Jean and eaten on the veranda at Spices restaurant, and a crawl to the beach hammocks to doze in the heat or read our books. \nThis is interspersed with a few dips in the sea and lunch of catch of the day or jerk chicken at Neptunes restaurant on the beach until it is almost sunset and time for a sundowner and the tough decision of where to dine. \nIt’s a very easy routine to fall into, but after a few days our feet itch to explore and we opt for a full-day tour of the island. First stop is St George’s, a bustling, pretty port town of colourful buildings built into the volcanic hills. \nWe visit Fort George, built by the French in the early 18th Century, where the former French barracks and prison now houses \nthe Grenada National Museum, which displays Carib and Arawak artefacts and detailed information about the sugar and whaling industries. \nWe also get our first glimpse of Grenada’s famous Grand Anse Beach, a two-mile arc of golden sand and calm turquoise waters, lined with sea grapes, coconut palms, boutique hotels and restaurants. \nBut instead of heading to the beach – which is very tempting – we take a short, scenic drive further north to Concord Falls. Surrounded by lush, tropical rainforest, we are rewarded with stunning heliconia and orchids and the refreshing mist from the waterfall’s spray. GETTY Grand Etang National Park's 3,800 acres of wildlife sanctuary has been protected for 85 years \nNext up is Grand Etang National Park, further inland. One fifth of the island’s terrain is preserved as national parkland or wildlife sanctuary, and Grand Etang’s 3,800 acres has been protected for 85 years. It is home to a rich array of plants and animals and the volcanic crater-formed Grand Etang Lake lies at its centre. \nGrenada is known as the spice island and it is easy to see why; fragrant nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, vanilla and cocoa all flourish in the fertile volcanic soil – not to mention fruit such as mangoes, bananas and avocados. \nWe have a buffet lunch at the Belmont Chocolate Estate where we also learn about the production of organic chocolate beans and the island’s thriving chocolate trade. \nThe nearby Grenada Chocolate Company is a cooperative of farmers and chocolate-makers who have been producing award-winning organic dark chocolate from bean to bar since 1999 and it is heavenly to work our way through their selection. \nA favourite is the delicious bar packed with sun-dried cocoa nibs and it gives us a whole new level of appreciation for chocolate. \nHaving seen a snippet of what Grenada has to offer on land, we decide to explore under the sea, not least because snorkelling and scuba diving is included at Sandals. \nAt Moliniere Bay is the Underwater Sculpture Park, an incredible submerged gallery created by artist Jason deCaires Taylor, that also serves as an artificial reef in a Marine Protected Area. The sculptures are in water so shallow that you can see them just by snorkelling, but to get up close we dive. Gliding our way past eerie, life-size figures \nof a mermaid and the epic Christ of the Deep is an experience I will never forget. \nAfter so much activity, we settle back into our more static daily routine at the resort and head to the Red Lane Spa for a treatment. Here, you can try everything from reflexology to hot-stone therapy, but I opt for a deep relief massage to remove the last remaining tension from my shoulders. \nOn our bed that evening we are left a quote by American poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, which could not be more apt: “Finish each day before you begin the next, and interpose a solid wall of sleep between the two.” \nThat’s not hard here. The beds are like clouds even before so much sun, sea air and amazing food – plus a few rum punches. \nBut what is so special about Grenada is how it stimulates your senses with its bright colours, lush landscape and exquisite spices and flavours. You are dazzled into a wonderful daze and life back home seems very far removed from everything here. \nWay to go \nSeven nights at Sandals La Source Grenada Resort & Spa costs from £1,679 per person, based on travel dates between September 1 and October 20, 2015. Prices include Luxury Included® (all-inclusive) accommodation in a South Seas Hideaway junior suite with balcony tranquillity soaking tub, return flights and resort transfers.
