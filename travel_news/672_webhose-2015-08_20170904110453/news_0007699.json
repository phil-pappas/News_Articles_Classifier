Given that a romantic break for two wasn’t on the cards, I decided to travel there with a trusted friend – Ramblers Worldwide Holidays . Group leader Neil – a retired architect who has been visiting Venice for 48 years – introduced me to Italy’s most charismatic city from the seat of a vaporetto . As we approached the famous Rialto Bridge, he told me that many of the once-magnificent buildings that line the Grand Canal are no longer occupied and that their owners face a constant struggle to maintain the buildings and their façades. It helped me to understand just how much Venice and its people rely on tourism, and was the first of many insights that gave me an authentic experience of La Serenissima – one that I would not have been able to discover on my own. But wherever you choose to walk in Italy, Ramblers Worldwide Holidays' dedicated leaders are able to share their considerable knowledge with you. This spectacular country has a culture that stretches back to the beginning of history. With Greeks, Romans, Etruscans, Spanish and even Brits having made their mark here, little nuggets of history can be found on every walk, in every church or cathedral and even in every meal. On a Ramblers Worldwide Holidays walking holiday in Italy, you’ll get to enjoy all of this with a small, informal and friendly group of walkers and a leader who can help interpret what you’re seeing and take you off the well-worn tourist paths. Group leader Neil helped to make my holiday truly magical and provided an invaluable safety net wherever we travelled You could explore the streets of Venice, Rome or Florence, hike around Lake Como or trek in the Italian mountains. A perennially popular choice is a walking holiday on the Sorrento Peninsula, where you walk along roads, paths and mule tracks through this mountainous area in the south of Italy. Your base will be the attractive resort town of Vico Equense, which commands panoramic views of the Bay of Naples. There will be optional visits to the ruins at Pompeii, Herculaneum and Paestum, as well as the stunning resorts of the Amalfi Coast, including Positano, Ravello and Amalfi itself. A day may be spent in the colourful city of Naples or on the glamorous island of Capri, and you’ll have the chance to follow part of the famous Path of the Gods ( Sentiero degli Dei ) – a spectacular trek between the hillside village of Bomerano and the seaside resort of Positano. Accommodation is in the three-star Hotel Mary, which has a large sun terrace and a swimming pool. On my trip to Venice, group leader Neil proved to be a bottomless well of information and funny stories. He helped to make my holiday truly magical and provided an invaluable safety net wherever we travelled, which is so vital to solo travellers like me. So rest assured that, whether you’re an ambitious hiker or a curious ambler, Ramblers Worldwide Holidays has an Italian walking holiday to suit your needs. There’s no question that the world is more beautiful on foot, and there are few countries more beautiful than la bella Italia . • Find advice, rewards and a brochure at Ramblers Worldwide Holidays or simply call an expert on 01707 331133", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:17:57.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
