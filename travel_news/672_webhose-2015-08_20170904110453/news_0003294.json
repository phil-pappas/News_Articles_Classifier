Across the board, tech workers earn an average of more than £40,000, and demand for coders is strong. For small, high-growth businesses, sourcing the right people is a perpetual challenge, but if you’re a newly qualified coder, what options are available when it comes to taking the next career step? At Makers Academy, a fast-track coding course in London’s East End, participants’ entry fees are supported by the school’s partnerships with local employers who are keen to have first pick of each cohort of graduates. Makers’ partners range from Deloitte to comparethemarket.com, and this shortcut to top interviews is at the heart of Makers Academy’s proposition for candidates, forming a natural extension to students’ on-the-job training and speeding up the recruitment process for both candidate and employer. Other than direct placements through organisations such as Makers Academy, what are the chances of a coder getting a job in London? The answer is: pretty high. Talent is a constant demand issue for tech businesses in London, as well as for the UK at large. The tech sector is generating jobs faster than any other sector, and the continued demand for coders and developers is testament to the strength of the industry. There are a number of regular events that help to connect coders with tech firms. The most popular of these is Silicon Milkroundabout, a job fair for the London tech industry, held twice a year. Other opportunities for coders to show off their skills include regular hackathons and hack days, meet-ups and other events held on a regular basis. Opportunities for coders to show off their skills include regular hackathons and hack days, meet-ups and other events held on a regular basis Despite the speed of development in Old Street’s Silicon Roundabout, coders should not restrict themselves to London alone. The high cost of living in London and the city’s congestion are making entrepreneurs consider other regions as hosts for burgeoning tech hubs around the UK. “Tech businesses are driving economic growth and tapping into the unique strengths and talents of our great cities such as Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool, and in the North East,” says Baroness Shields, Chair of Tech City UK. From Silicon Fen in Cambridge to Silicon Glen in Scotland and Silicon Gorge in Bristol, many high-tech clusters have sprung up in recent years. Indeed, despite London always being in the tech spotlight, some 74 per cent of digital companies are based outside the capital. Take Bristol, for example. As part of Silicon Gorge, the city is home to a number of high-tech engineering firms, including Intel, HP Labs, Infineon, Imagination Technology, NVIDIA and many more. These companies, as well as the hundreds of start-ups choosing to set up in Silicon Gorge rather than the more expensive London, are all eager to hire young, driven coders. Coding skills are not restricted to becoming a coder, either. The skills are transferrable to other aspects of business life, including data analysis, finance and more. While coding isn’t likely to replace reading, writing and arithmetic as the core requirements for many office posts, employers are beginning to realise the benefits of a background in teamwork and problem solving – core skills within any coder’s set. With more business functions requiring digital support, market demand for trained coders has never been so strong. It truly is a good time to geek. • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:49:59.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
