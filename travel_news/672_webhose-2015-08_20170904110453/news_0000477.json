I’ve seen aerial shots of mighty blue whales on TV documentaries and watched the screen open-mouthed in wonder as flying manta rays leap from the water and fly like stealth bombers.\nBut it was not until I booked a cruise to the region I discovered that one of the highlights might not be the sea or any of its creatures, but an all-day journey to inland Mexico, mostly by train, to a mighty complex of mountains and gorges bigger and deeper than the Grand Canyon.\nI had never heard of Copper Canyon. And even when I saw it was on the list of excursions from cruise ship Azamara Quest, I half expected it to be nothing more than a two-bit mining town.\nHow wrong could I be? It might have been one of the longest one-day excursions I’d ever taken from a ship but it was worth every minute and every cent.\nIt hardly seems right to refer to it simply as Copper Canyon. This vast region of north-west Mexico is riven apart by green and red gorges cutting so far into the earth’s crust that it’s impossible to see the bottom in most cases.\nThere are realistically only two ways to get there – by horse or by train. As we had only a day it had to be train.\nBooked on the ship, the excursion cost $599 per person but still attracted almost 200 participants from the 700 passengers on board. Azamara Quest was berthed in Topolobampo and we were walking down the gangway at 5am for a two-hour coach ride to El Fuertes where our chartered train was waiting.\nIsla Coronados, in the Bay of Loreto National Park, Mexico\nAll aboard by 7.15am, we began a six-hour climb to the mountains, the scenery growing more impressive by the mile. Through tunnel after tunnel, and over precarious bridges crossing arroyos (creek beds), the track snaked its way alongside rushing rivers and craggy cliffs.\nA small army of train and ship staff kept us fed and watered, while an assiduous carriage porter in double-breasted jacket, bow tie and cap collected our empties.\nAt Temoris, about halfway through the journey, the track took two horseshoe bends, one of them in a mile-long tunnel, to gain height from the valley floor, climbing 3,000ft to the plateau above.\nEventually we reached Posada Barrancas station. All change!\nWhile most passengers went straight for lunch at the Mirador Hotel, perched on the rim of the canyon, about 50 of us paid a further $45 to take an exhilarating trip by cable car to a stumpy outcrop further into the canyon and providing breathtaking views of not only Copper Canyon but also Urique and Tararecua Canyons.\nAt the cable car station there were women from the indigenous Tarahumara people – each with a baby on the hip – selling souvenirs. They were a refreshingly un-pushy bunch and did not even demand tips when photographed.\nThe views from the top were simply stupendous. If only more people knew about it, Copper Canyon would surely be in the running for inclusion in any list of the world’s Top 10 natural wonders.\nWhat a view: The train to Copper Canyon in Mexico\nEvery chasm and cliff, peak and plateau is enormous and it’s almost impossible to appreciate just how vast the canyon complex is. Four of its arms are 1,000ft deeper than anything in the Grand Canyon of Colorado.\nFrom valley floor to mountain top there are three distinct climatic zones, each with its own vegetation. In total there are believed to be 23 species of pine, 200 of oak, and alder and poplar trees. Wild flowers blossom and the pipe organ cacti of the lower levels are replaced higher up by star-shaped sotol and yucca, which the Indians use to make everything from alcoholic drinks to baskets.\nThe colour palette of the rocks, rivers and sky contains a million shades, and erosion of the volcanic deposits laid down over 15 million years exposes rocks of every hue.\nThere are gold and silver mines, but little copper – the name is derived from the colour rather than metal deposits.\nFrom our cable car eyrie, we rejoined our companions at the Mirador Hotel. A quick lunch, more photos, souvenirs, a display of traditional dancing and a brief example of the marathon running for which the locals are famous, then it was back to the train.\nThe downhill journey was a little quicker, but the final two hours on the bus seemed to take for ever.\nBack at the quayside, Quest’s crew were quick to provide a restorative cup of hot chocolate and rum. It had been 17 hours on the go – and all that travel can be exhausting.\nBesides, I had to be ready for much more on this action-packed cruise. I had already been enthralled by daring cliff-divers in Mazatlan and enchanted by dancers on the Malecon (seafront promenade) in La Paz.\nIn Loreto – once the haunt of Hollywood starlets – I took a boat trip with fishermen to nearby islands. No whales to be seen, unfortunately, but there were dolphins by the score, sea lions, and I was able to tick off blue-footed boobies in my Smutty Guide to Birdwatching.\nLocals: Tarahumara Indian girl at Copper Canyon, Mexico\nToday’s Hollywood stars who come to Mexico for some away-from-it-all R&R now head to Cabo San Lucas, which has become an over-developed collection of condos and high-end hotels, mixed in with an infinite number of bars knocking out tequila shots.\nAway from its seedy streets, however, it has possibly the most dramatic Land’s End scenery in the world. One beach is washed by the Sea of Cortez on one side and the Pacific on the other. And there’s a natural rock arch that dwarfs anything our own dear Lulworth Cove has to offer.\nIt was on an excursion from here that we finally saw the humpback whales we had been looking for all week. Our tour boat was escorted in and out of the harbour by friendly sea lions, and we were fuelled with an unlimited supply of margaritas, so there was a moment when I thought I might be hallucinating.\nBut they were real enough. Mother and calf together with their dorsal fins breaking the water before the tail flukes appeared, signifying a deep dive.\nAnd then another specimen leaping spectacularly from the waves before crashing back in an avalanche of spray.\nBack on the haven of our cabin on Azamara Quest, we had to shut the balcony doors to keep out the din from half a mile away as two DJs competed to see whose clubbers could make most noise.\nThat’s the great thing about cruises. I saw wildlife. I had my Copper Canyon surprise. And I could get peace when I wanted.\nSmall is beautiful Perfectly formed: The Azamara Quest\nAzamara Quest and sister ship Azamara Journey are boutique-sized vessels carrying 670 passengers each. They were built in 2007 for the now-defunct Renaissance Cruises.\nSmall they may be, but they have big aspirations. Service is exceptional and the open-seating main dining room is supplemented by a buffet restaurant with ample choice, and (for an additional fee) a top-class steakhouse and an Italian restaurant. The libraries have a beautiful painted trompe l’oeil ceiling.\nWine and beer are included with lunch and dinner, as are house spirits and cocktails. Bottled water, coffee and tea are all complimentary.\nBoth ships will get multi-million pound make-overs next year. Under veteran boss Larry Pimentel, Azamara has pioneered “destination immersion” cruising with longer stays in port and a spectacular “Azamazing Evening” on every voyage. In Mexico, this was a blend of myth, mystery, ballet and fire-eating under the stars.\nGet there Cruises to the Sea of Cortez on mainstream ships (as opposed to adventure cruises with more rudimentary facilities) are rare and usually book up well in advance.\nAzamara Quest will return in Feb 2017 for a 12nt voyage departing from San Diego and visiting Mazatlan, La Paz, Topolobampo, Guaymas, Loreto (overnight), and Cabo San Lucas.\nFares from £3,473pp (based on 2 sharing) for a Club Interior cabin; book before Aug 31 to receive a free double upgrade to a Club Balcony cabin.
