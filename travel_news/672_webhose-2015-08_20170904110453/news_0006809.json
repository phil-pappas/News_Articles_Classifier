Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, and Luton saw record figures, with Stansted getting closer to its all-time 2007 record. When the CAA publishes its figures for the month, probably in October, it will almost certainly name July 2015 as an all-time UK high. \nHeathrow saw 7.29m passengers pass through the airport, an increase of 4.7% on the same period last year. For Gatwick the number was 4.3m, up 6.4%. Next came Manchester with an increase of 6.1% to 2.5m followed by Stansted at 2.1m, 12.5% up. \nPerhaps the most astonishing was Luton as it recorded a 16% increase as 1.3m people passed through the airport. \nWhat is particularly surprizing about this figure is that the airport is now in the throes of a major rebuilding project. Arriving passengers are now required to use the old terminal building, made redundant in 1998 with the current building, but for whatever reason never demolished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:53:02.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
