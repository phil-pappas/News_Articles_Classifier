Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 18, 2015 eTN   \nMedia reports have started to emerge in Kampala that aged and faulty security equipment at Entebbe International Airport has become a matter of serious concern for airlines and other state agencies and was, according to the Daily Monitor, even raised in a briefing on airport security to President Museveni. \nProcurement of new equipment appears also bogged down in bureaucrazy – pun fully intended – and over allegations of procedural failures and procurement rule breaches. The names of two companies were mentioned in the local media, Rapiscan, based in Uganda and Restrata Solutions, based in Dubai, the latter apparently selected to purchase equipment from the former which previously had supplied directly to the UCAA and others buyers in Uganda. \nUganda’s transport minister was prompt to go on record in the media raising the question where the 10 US Dollar security fee has gone to the UCAA collects in Entebbe from every passenger (levied on the ticket cost). He ominously suggested that fee was not to pay UCAA fat cats’ allowances and perks but to keep equipment working and replace it when newer and better options are available on the market. Minister Byabagambi in fact was quoted in local media to have said: ‘I am entering their empire where they have been the Alpha and the Omega as if the CAA is for their family. Whoever doesn’t want to work as I direct will have to go; give me three months and Entebbe airport will be different and this will be by force’ reportedly causing panic among UCAA officials. \nThis was apparently prompted by the UCAA pleading with other government officials to prevail on higher authorities to direct a release of funds. \nNotably in Uganda have the regulatory functions, badly executed as it is considering last year’s disastrous decision to suspend all AOC’s of Ugandan registered airlines for flights abroad to escape ICAO citations and potential sanctions, not been separated from the management functions of airports. This is unlike in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania where stand-alone Airport Authorities were created to keep management and oversight on different platforms. This division of powers does not exist in Uganda and therefore are the management function of the airports, including Entebbe, subject to oversight by the very same individuals sitting under the same roof with them wearing a set of different hats. \nEntebbe International Airport, once a shining example of short ways and functionality, has been relegated to the bottom end of rankings by passengers using the airport, in comparison with for instance Kigali or Nairobi’s shining new Terminal 1A and other more recently commissioned structures. Passengers have long access ways to the terminal, entirely unacceptable when it rains, as little shelter prevents them from getting thoroughly soaked after vehicular access, unlike at any other airport in the region, was banned by the UCAA. \nAs the country goes into elections mode have calls become louder across the board to deal more decisively with corruption in government and in government institutions. A court case brought two weeks ago against a former transport and works minister and senior officials – who were then kept in remand for several days before being able to secure bail – may be a harbinger of things to come, as President Museveni seeks re-election and may very well put corrupt officials to the proverbial sword to show his resolve that he is willing to deal with the menace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:31:33.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
