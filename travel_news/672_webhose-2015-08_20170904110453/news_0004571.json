Expedia early this year said it would buy Orbitz for $1.3 billion. It had hoped to complete the acquisition in the second half of this year, but the proposed buyout is still under review by the Justice Department. The hotel trade group said Thursday that the deal would \"severely reduce consumer choice.\" It also noted that Expedia charges hotels, on average, 11 percent higher commissions than Orbitz. Many smaller, independent hotels rely on these sites to attract travelers who otherwise would not have heard of their properties. If the buyout goes through Expedia and competitor The Priceline Group Inc. will control 95 percent of the online travel agency bookings in the U.S., according to the hotel trade group. Priceline owns sites such as Booking.com and Kayak. Expedia declined to comment on the pushback from the hotel industry Thursday. Expedia and Orbitz own several websites that allow travelers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms or car rentals. Orbitz Worldwide Inc., based in Chicago, owns HotelClub.com, Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com. Expedia Inc., based in Bellevue, Washington, owns Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Check Tickets, Trivago and Hotwire.com. Copyright 2014 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
