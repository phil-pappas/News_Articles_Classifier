The service is ideal for those who want to explore Europe off the beaten track but are worried about their rusty map-reading skills. During the first day or two of the hike, the guide will walk with hikers, explain how to read a map, assist in understanding route notes and then point travellers in the right direction to continue their holiday independently.\nOne of the inn-to-inn walks in which hikers can take advantage of this service is a journey through the wild hill country of northern Portugal. This will take walkers into the lush green valleys of the Peneda-Geres national park with its spectacular granite hills and historic villages, where locals continue a lifestyle that is centuries old. Highlights of the journey will include walking along ancient paved footpaths which date back to the time of the Roman Empire, visiting the medieval Lindoso Castle, journeying through tranquil woodland and staying in the impressively preserved hotel Pousada Santa Maria do Bouro, built in the 13th century as a Cistercian monastery.\nTravellers can also visit historic Porto, with its numerous historic sites, and enjoy various local delicacies, including port wine, which the region is renowned for.\nThe hike is of medium-hard difficulty, with three to seven walking hours each day, and the best months to walk are April to August. The package includes seven nights’ accommodation, all breakfasts, six picnics, one evening meal and luggage transfers – meaning hikers simply carry a day pack. In 2016, the tour will cost £592 (A$1260 depending on exchange rates), twin-share – a three per cent reduction on 2015 prices if booked by October 15, 2015. Australians need to Quote: ‘PPR16’ when booking to access the discount. The services of a local guide for the first day of walking costs £115 (A$245 depending on exchange rates), irrespective of group size. A single room supplement is available and extra nights in Porto or at Santa Maria do Bouro can be booked through On Foot Holidays.\nSource:- Visit On Foot Holidays", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:11:06.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
