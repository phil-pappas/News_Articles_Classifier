The cruise line is also donating monies to the Tampa Bay and Louisiana chapters of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). \n\"Carnival is the number one cruise line for families and we're delighted to team up with Dr. Seuss Enterprises to bring the joy of reading to kids with these special presentations in Tampa and New Orleans while supporting local animal rescue organizations,\" said Christine Duffy, Carnival's president. \"The kids were absolutely thrilled to have been treated to a reading of the first new Dr. Seuss book in 25 years and our most sincere thanks to Evan and Angela, as well as the SPCA, for the valuable work they do each and every day,\" she added. \nDonning Dr. Seuss' signature striped hat and surrounded by rescue dogs from the SPCA, Longoria and Hill delighted children with spirited readings of \"What Pet Should I Get?\" which is based on an original manuscript and accompanying sketches by Dr. Seuss, aka Ted Geisel, that was discovered in the La Jolla, Calif., home of the late beloved children's author. \nFollowing the reading, children and their chaperones joined The Cat in the Hat, Sam I am, and Thing 1 and Thing 2 for Carnival's popular Green Eggs and Ham Breakfast with The Cat in the Hat and Friends, part of the line's exclusive Seuss at Sea program. \nLaunched in 2014, Seuss at Sea is a fleetwide program featuring exciting youth, family, dining and entertainment experiences inspired by the amazing world and words of Dr. Seuss. The program includes such fun activities as the Seuss-a-palooza Parade and Story Time, as well as character interactions, Dr. Seuss toys and games and popular movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:39:49.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
