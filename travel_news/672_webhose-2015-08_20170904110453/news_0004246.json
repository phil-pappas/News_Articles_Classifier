It's also an essential destination for visitors to New York, offering art, architecture, restaurants, shopping and more. \nAttendance at Harlem's Studio Museum has soared from 63,298 in the 2009-10 fiscal year to 111,086 in 2013-14. Restaurants like celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson's Streetbird Rotisserie are giving out-of-towners and locals a reason to head uptown for a meal. And Harlem is the second-most requested neighbourhood in Manhattan after midtown at Big Apple Greeter, which connects tourists with volunteers for free neighbourhood visits. \nEven the Museum of Modern Art, located in midtown, is encouraging trips to Harlem with an online self-guided walking tour inspired by a MOMA exhibition, Jacob Lawrence's \"Migration Series\" paintings. Lawrence painted scenes of African-Americans from the rural South moving to Northern cities in the early 20th century. The free tour -- http://www.Moma.org/harlemwalkingtour -- highlights Harlem locations where Lawrence studied art, did research and found inspiration. \n\"Harlem is an iconic, beautiful, world-renowned New York City enclave that continues to reinvent itself, drawing visitors from far and wide,\" said Fred Dixon, president of the city's tourism agency, NYC & Company. \"New restaurants, shops, galleries, vibrant entertainment and nightlife have positioned Harlem as a must-see neighbourhood on anyone's New York City itinerary.\" \nHere are some top Harlem attractions. \nSTUDIO MUSEUM \nThe museum has five shows up through Oct. 25, but perhaps its most famous exhibit is a display of two words: \"ME WE.\" Boxer Muhammad Ali recited the words in response to a request for a poem after giving a speech at Harvard; http://www.studiomuseum.org , 144 W. 125th St. Open Thursday-Friday, noon-9 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; Sunday, noon-6 p.m. Adults, $7.

The landmarked, elegant stone-and-brick townhouses date to the 1890s and have been home to prominent African-Americans like musician Eubie Blake and Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. \nAPOLLO THEATER AND HOTEL HISTORY \nYou can attend the Apollo's famous amateur night or take a tour to learn about its history hosting the likes of James Brown, B.B. King and Aretha Franklin. \nStand outside the marquee at 253 W. 125th St. and look east across the street for a tall, stately building bearing the words \"Hotel Theresa.\" It's no longer a hotel, but for decades it hosted athletes, entertainers, business executives and other African-Americans turned away by hotels downtown.
