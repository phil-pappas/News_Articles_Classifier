If it weren’t for the pal being on the tube, and therefore unable to see my panicked texts shrieking, “We need to go somewhere else fast!”, you wouldn’t have seen me for dust. It’s a long time since I’ve been anywhere so initially unprepossessing. The address is Borough High Street, but I don’t expect to find Lobos squatting under a railway bridge where dustballs of rat fur and urine skitter. The entrance is a dark maw, unadorned apart from a pegboard sign announcing, “MEAT & TAPAS: the wolf is always evil if you only listen to Red Riding Hood” (vegetarians, you’d do well to give Lobos a wide berth). All very gnomic.\nWaiting for the pal in a dim, tin-ceilinged room, I’m still unconvinced. Rather than being in Borough Market proper, it’s in a feeder alleyway and facing an equally leery-looking joint called Ginger Whiskey (me neither). The mood is murky. It reminds me of weird, penumbral ramen or yakitori joints in the likes of Tokyo’s Golden Gai and Piss Alley.\nAnd then Jaume, a chap about to become my new best pal, delivers a glass of dry Juan Gil muscat, all peach and pepper and melon, and with it a plate of padrón peppers, greasy, crunchy with salt flakes – “From me, while you’re waiting.” I get the rogue hot one immediately. Suddenly, this is my kind of place.\nActual dinner is upstairs, but hopes of it magically morphing into something more salubrious are quickly dashed. If anything, it’s grungier: a clutch of little tables and tiny, oxblood booths squished into a low-ceilinged tunnel whose flimsy roof rattles ominously with every passing train. There’s a ham-embellished bar and small open kitchen. Odd homilies cover bare-lightbulbed walls, and the black-clad staff’s T-shirts blurt “Attitude” or “Instinto” or “Captured”. It’s all very David Lynch, circa Eraserhead.\nThen sherry: en rama, an unfiltered curiosity bottled straight from cask, to be drunk young. You don’t get that at La Tasca . Lobos’ owners worked at Brindisa , and they know more than the score. I’ve recently bought a whole acorn-fed ham in Montánchez, Extremadura’s jamón Mecca, from a shop in whose fragrant depths I’d happily be buried. Lobos’ Ibérico de bellota, from Córdoba by way of Maltby Street’s wonderful Bar Tozino , is, enragingly, even better, the meat dark and perfumed, the fat nutty-sweet, the whole thing like eating celestial essence of sainted porker. And with that sherry? Woah, mama.\nIn case you haven’t picked up on it – the name Lobos means “wolf” – meat is the thing here. There are legs of Castilian lamb, beef rib-eye with foie gras, chorizo in red wine. But I’m after pig, particularly those recherché cuts of Ibérico: deliriously fat-marbled secreto; presa crusted in fat so it almost self-bastes. Why choose if you can have the lot? So we have a board laden with all of the above, plus fillet, which comes, bravely, almost raw within. The meat is from the Ginger Pig , so no need for oh-no-raw-pork wussery. There are Catalan-style trintxtat (sic), potatoes with cabbage and pork fat, and homemade crisps spattered with a punchy coriander and garlic mojo verde.\nMy Spanish restaurant bellwether is the croqueta. The finest in London remain those from José Pizarro , a miraculous combination of wibbly, jamón-studded bechamel and fragile, physics-defying shell. Lobos’ are huge, stout, dense; tattooed bouncers to Pizarro’s ballet dancers, rammed not only with ham, but also with smoked bacon and chorizo for good measure. It’s a porcine orgy. We’ve by now ordered more wine (an excellent white rioja), but are ranting so much it has been ignored. Then something happens that I’ve never previously encountered: Jaume replaces our half-drunk glasses with fresh, crisp, full ones. “These,” he says, “were getting warm.” See? New best friend.\nWe have octopus vinaigrette, too: beautifully tender, slightly smoky, flecked with minuscule dice of tomato and pepper, and glugged with good, grassy olive oil. And green salad that, with its pistachios and preserved lemon, asparagus and ribbons of courgette, delivers way more than its promise. The food here is the pearl in the gnarly oyster.\nI couldn’t be more surprised at how much I like eccentric, dark, noisy Lobos. I want to fall out of here post-midnight and not remember leaving, reeling from sherry and fine pork (shame it closes at 11pm). It’s a dive, sure. But it’s a delicious one.\n• Lobos 14 Borough High Street, London SE1, 020-74075361. Open Mon-Sat, noon-3.30pm, 5.30-11pm.
