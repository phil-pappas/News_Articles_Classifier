Ashleigh A. Peck, a spokeswoman for North American Aerospace Defense. \nThe plane landed safely, and one person was taken off the plane. \n\"All passengers are fine,\" airport spokesman Heath Montgomery said. \nThe FBI told ABC News that the incident was a \"misunderstanding,\" and nobody was arrested or taken into custody, but no other details were available. \nCarsten Stepanowicz (ste-PAN'-o-wits), a spokesman for the airline in Germany, said the pilot requested help because of an unruly passenger on board. \n\"It was not possible to go on with the flight, so the pilot decided to land in Denver,\" he said. He said he could not release details on the number of passengers. \nThe FBI did not return a phone from The Associated Press seeking comment. \nThe incident occurred shortly after 6 p.m., Montgomery said. The Transportation Security Administration and Denver police met the plane at the gate, and the FBI was notified. \nThe plane resumed the flight to Germany after refueling. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that the FBI did not meet the plane at the gate but was notified.
