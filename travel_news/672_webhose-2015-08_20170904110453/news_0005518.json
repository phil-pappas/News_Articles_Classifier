Ranging from 18 to 34 days, the Grand Expeditions begin with an expedition cruise in the Galapágos Islands, before connecting to a land adventure, and ending with a further expedition cruise exploring the coast of Central America, South America, or Antarctica. \nThe all-inclusive Grand Expeditions package is orchestrated by Silversea and incorporates cruise fares for Silver Galapagos and Silver Explorer at 20% off the individual published rate. Also featured in the package are hotel accommodations, land tours, return air travel between Ecuador and the Galápagos Islands, intra-tour air travel and ground transportation, as well as charter flights to Ushuaia, if applicable. \"Our Grand Expeditions offer a unique blend of overland adventure combined with two amazing expedition cruise experiences - all expertly curated by our destination experts,\" said Lisa McAuley, Commercial Director UK and Ireland.
