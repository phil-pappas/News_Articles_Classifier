Finding an activity that the whole family can enjoy together is harder than it sounds, however. One thing that gets everyone going is skiing – and ski holidays are among the most popular activities for families. \nSkiing and other winter sports give everyone the opportunity to enjoy the snow, get into the great outdoors, and best of all - it’s fun! Once you’re finished on the slopes, the family can head back to your cosy catered chalet and enjoy hot chocolate and toasted marshmallows in front of a roaring fireplace, swapping stories of your day’s adventures. What could be better? \nAs with any activity, however, children require special consideration when they start skiing. Below, we present a few tips on how to best ensure the safety of your young ones while having fun on the slopes. \nAre They Old Enough to Ski? \nSeeing photos of toddlers wearing cute ski gear may give you a false sense of security with regards to taking your toddler skiing, but experts say that children younger than four are too young to be out on the slopes. Before this age, children simply do not have the physical strength to ski, says Herve Favre, founder of the Alpine Ski School Evolution 2. Fortunately, there are plenty of other activities you can engage in with younger children, such as short snow walks or simply playing in the snow. Or you could opt to take advantage of the childcare facilities of your ski resort, ensuring that your child has fun and is well cared for while you spend a few hours on the slopes or in the spa. You can even book a massage in your catered chalet after you’ve put them down for their nap. Are They Properly Dressed for the Activity?The cold can be more dangerous to your child’s well-being than falling down or other minor accidents, so making certain they are warm enough is the first thing you need to do. A good helmet and some form of protection against sun and snow glare, wind, and snow are crucial. Layers of warm, waterproof, and insulated clothing, such as snow jackets, pants, gloves, socks, and boots (and don’t forget the thermal underwear!) are important - not only for warmth, but also to provide extra padding in the event they lose their balance and fall (snow can be harder than it looks). Sunblock is also a must. Investing in pocket warmers (air-activated heat pockets) is also a good idea to help warm cold little hands quickly. Children love being out in the snow but it’s best to limit the time they spend in such extreme temperatures, so be ready to take them back to your warm catered chalet as soon as they start complaining about being cold or tired. \nAre They Physically Ready for the Day? \nMaking sure your kids have a good breakfast is never more important than when you're planning a day on the slopes. Being out in the cold all day burns a lot of calories, not to mention the physical exertion necessary to take on skiing. Be sure to bring plenty of snacks, such as nuts and mini-chocolate bars (stash a few in your child’s pockets as well), for quick energy boosts, and consider giving older children some money for hot drinks from food stalls in case you get separated. In addition, do not ever push children to go out in the snow if they are feeling the least bit unwell – there are plenty of fun things to do in the catered chalet and you don’t want to risk them getting sick on holiday. \nTaking your children skiing can be one of the most wonderful adventures you can have as a family, take all the above tips into consideration and you can be sure your holiday will run smoothly.
