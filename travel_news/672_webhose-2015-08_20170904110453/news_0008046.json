Launched by ‘flying Scotsmen’ in kilts, the new boat is one of the company’s largest investments to date, increasing its fleet to four and allowing Loch Ness’ only five-star cruise company to host an additional 800 visitors per day on one of Scotland’s most iconic vistas. \nAptly named ‘The Rebel’, this latest addition is part of a £1 million investment which will allow Loch Ness by Jacobite to further support economic growth in the local area and Scotland. Reaching top speeds of up to 12 knots, the boat was originally designed and built in France, where it sailed between Cannes, Nice and St Tropez before traveling to the Scottish Highlands. After recently moving its head office to new visitor-friendly premises at Dochgarroch on the Caledonian Canal, The Rebel’s arrival also comes in the same year the firm launched a new brand after almost four decades in business. The new ‘Loch Ness by Jacobite’ brand is already becoming a familiar sight around the loch for both locals and visitors, and can be found on the company’s fleet as well as at its new headquarters. Freda Newton, managing director, Loch Ness by Jacobite, said: “The introduction of The Rebel along with our new headquarters and rebrand provides us with the perfect opportunity to strengthen our international appeal, building on Scotland’s natural strengths. “The Loch Ness Monster is a hugely popular global attraction and we wanted to make sure that we could accommodate the ever-growing interest in exploring the area by water. “It is great to be able to give our new vessel such a splashing Scottish welcome as we prepare to carry more people on a journey of discovery around Loch Ness.” The company’s growth marks the 40-year-old attraction’s strategy to attract more international visitors to the world renowned site and position Loch Ness by Jacobite as the best way to experience the magic of the water. Unlike the loch’s legendary occupant – the Loch Ness Monster – the colourful fleet already attracts over 100,000 tourists a year from every corner of the globe. And now armed with a new name and additional boat there will be no mistaking its authority on the loch. This latest investment has been supported with funding by Highlands and Island Enterprise and the Bank of Scotland. Barrie Aird, SME banking relationship manager at Bank of Scotland, said: “Loch Ness by Jacobite reflects the vibrant tourism industry that Scotland is renowned for. This is a very exciting venture to be part of as we’re committed to supporting the growth of local businesses and economies. “Jacobite is going from strength to strength and this latest investment in The Rebel highlights the demand for its services which cater for the growing number of tourists visiting the area. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the business and seeing what the future holds.” Nicola Douglas, head of business growth at HIE for the Inner Moray Firth team, said: “We have worked with Loch Ness by Jacobite for a number of years and we are delighted to support their latest venture. Loch Ness is a destination that attracts visitors from across the world and the new vessel The Rebel adds to the high quality experience offered by the company. We wish Loch Ness by Jacobite all the best and look forward to working with them in the future.” Established in 1975 by Inverness quarry master the late Dan MacWilliam, Jacobite has continued to evolve through the decades to provide a five-star range of cruising and touring experiences on the stunning Loch Ness. Originally a popular attraction for those in the Highlands, Loch Ness by Jacobite has grown its international audience since its inception and now boasts visitors from all over the world, including the USA, Malaysia and Australia. Based in Inverness, Loch Ness by Jacobite now operates a fleet of four luxury vessels, the Jacobite Queen, the Jacobite Princess, the Jacobite Warrior, and now the Jacobite Rebel, offering daily trips on the world famous Loch.
