After 18 holes of medal golf that tested the skill and nerve of 48 amateur players – 24 men and 24 women – Alexander Green from Balbirnie Park GC in Fife, Chris Prior from Bearsden GC in Glasgow, Jill Wallace from Thornton GC in Fife and Elizabeth Goodwin from Glenbervie GC in Falkirk made it a clean sweep for Scotland in the Scotland & North of England Regional Final. The four are rewarded with places in September’s grand final at the spectacular Old Head Golf Links in County Kinsale in the Republic of Ireland. A beaming Green credited his success on the day to “driving the ball really well”, while Prior secured his place in the final with a flourish, delivering his approach to the par-four 18th green to within an inch of the hole for a tap-in birdie. The shot earned Prior the men’s runner-up position outright. Wallace scored particularly well on the challenging front nine of the Lee Westwood Colt Course to defeat Strathaven GC’s Anne Lang by a stroke in the women’s competition. But Lang can’t make the Grand Final for family reasons, so third-placed Goodwin steps up. Almost 600 golf clubs in England, Scotland and Wales have entered the inaugural Old Mutual Wealth Golf Challenge and the remaining 12 finalists will be decided via three more regional finals – at Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, Celtic Manor in Newport and London GC in Kent.
