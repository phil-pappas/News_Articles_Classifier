With so many gimmicky eateries coming and going in London, it’s strangely refreshing to go somewhere that’s been open for years and aims to impress its customers simply with excellent service and skilfully prepared food. It may seem a strange and perhaps misguided deviation, then, to see that the venue is this month serving a new Korean-inspired menu. But there’s good reason behind it. With the restaurant since 2006 and now its head chef, Joo Won is himself from Korea and has achieved a long-held aim by offering a seven-course tasting menu that showcases how nuanced and sophisticated his nation’s cuisine can be. Available only for the month of August and costing from £110 or £169 with wine pairings, it fuses Korean condiments and techniques with English produce and the occasional French flourish. Dishes include tender marinated pork with pickled mooli and soy bean; braised short rib of Korean-style beef with a ribbon of kimchi and stuffed courgette; and tastier-than-it-sounds sweet red bean cream and black rice ice cream. I tried it on the opening night and, though clearly different from the norm, those high standards have been retained and the response was good. It seems it’s a deviation that’s paid off. • The best hotels in central London “Not your regular barbecue restaurant”, so its owners say, Rök Smokehouse on Curtain Road in Shoreditch is a “Nordic smokehouse” that uses traditional Swedish techniques such as brining, pickling and smoking to coax new flavours and textures from British ingredients (with meats coming exclusively from Cobble Lane Cured charcutiers in Islington). Dishes include beef shin croquettes with horseradish and duck leg with bacon and lingonberry jam. There’s also a regularly changing cocktail list on offer to tempt in passersby who might fancy a drink and snack before starting their night out. Jacob Kenedy and Victor Hugo, owners of Soho’s Bocca di Lupo restaurant and Gelupo gelateria, this month take up shop in Covent Garden . Occupying what was once a Pizza Hut at the intersection between Cambridge Circus and Seven Dials, Vico serves Italian street food and gelato. Pizza by the slice, arancini, Mediterranean seafood and other simple snacks will be on offer. It will be “intensely casual” with “cutlery frowned upon” - which sounds a touch contrived - but at the very least expect it to be a popular pit stop for theatregoers looking for something quick and easy before show time. Soho ’s long-established French restaurant L’Escargot is collaborating with Fentimans Ltd this month to launch a pop-up cocktail bar . Throughout August, what is usually the top-floor Salon Noir will be styled as a Victorian-era greenhouse abundant with plants, which will be used to make one of six cocktails on offer during the event (five at £7 each; one reduced to £5 on a rotating basis each day). A selection of special events will help to liven the place up too, such as a music night each Tuesday and mixology classes throughout the month. • The best hotels in central London The British Game seasons opens on August 12, so over the coming weeks expect a proliferation of grouse, hare and more to appear on London restaurant menus. Among them, Koffmann’s at the Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge will again serve Pierre Koffmann’s Classic Grouse dish (a £26 serving of grouse with a rich pate) alongside other seasonal dishes. On the other side of the city, the Jugged Hare by Barbican is also serving a special game menu over the coming weeks, with daily-changing specials including unexpected dishes such as squirrel and wild boar. For those who’d really like to engage with the season, that venue is also offering three-hour game masterclasses from October to February, which will cost £150 per person. • The best hotels in central London Struggling to get a reservation at one of the above? Recent openings tried and tested below: Even if you didn’t know that there’s a restaurant and bar on the top floors of the Gherkin it’s almost inconsequential information: it is typically only open to members of a private members’ club and workers in the building. So for anyone who’s ever wanted to explore the building it’s exciting news that a pop-up Moroccan-themed restaurant and bar takes up residence there until September 4 and is open to all. I visited on the 39th-floor restaurant’s opening night, when diners could choose between either a £59 five-course tasting or a la carte menu. I went for the former and, allowing for waiting staff’s first-night uncertainty about some of the dishes, there were some wobbles. Dishes such as harissa prawns with cactus or lamb with prunes and couscous were tasty but waits were long and portion sizes a touch mean-spirited. What couldn’t be faulted, though, was the setting. With the Gherkin’s glass dome rising above you, the setting is unmistakeable; the view is just as spectacular. And if you don’t want dinner, you can amble up instead to the very top floor to a Moroccan-themed bar for cocktails, snacks and to watch the sun set. Found within the Savoy hotel , there’s renewed impetus to visit Kaspar’s seafood restaurant and grill now that new head chef Holger Jackisch is at the helm. The German has finessed the menu thoroughly, but the changes are subtle and the emphasis remains on fresh British seafood and skilfully prepared locally sourced meats. All solid, tasty and straightforward, we enjoyed a vibrant dish of pan-roasted seafood with pak choi and laksa sauce and Isle of Skye lobster. Service is assured too, eased perhaps by how quiet it was on the Sunday night we visited. For atmosphere, then, it’s perhaps better to schedule a visit towards the beginning of the weekend, when a meal can be bookended with a visit to the Beaufort, which is usually closed on Sundays and remains one of the most glamorous hotel bars in London .
