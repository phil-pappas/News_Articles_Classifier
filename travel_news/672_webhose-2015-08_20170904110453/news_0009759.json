A quick report from the five indicated that LGBT Hawai`i received \"overwhelming support\" for their suggested international LGBT marketing & outreach initiative. \nScott Foster, co-founder of LGBTHAWAII.COM and the Editor of the organization's companion news blog, the LGBT Community News said, \"We truly appreciate the Hawai`i Tourism Authority hosting our group as their guests and would sincerely hope that a new collaborative spirit will be the ultimate outcome. We all bring important pieces to the table and have the same basic business goals. \nFoster noted, \"We were particularly pleased to hear 25-year travel industry veteran Richard Cutting-Miller, the Executive VP of Canadian-based Resonance Consultancy echo our sentiments in his presentation, The next Generation of Travelers.\" LGBT Hawai`i is encouraging HTA to fund a research study to help all of Hawaii's many tourist industry related businesses to better understand and market to the lucrative international LGBT Market. \nJuergen T Steinmetz, media partner and co-sponsor for LGBT Hawaii said: \"The first step to any new marketing communications initiative is to learn as much about the targeted market as possible. Tourism market research helps to understand the demographics of visitors and prospective visitors, helps with strategies, creative, messaging, imagery, offers, etc. and guides the development of an effective marketing plan. This is a proven approach and should be no different with the LGBT market for Hawaii. \nNumerous states and cities have invested into understanding the LGBT travel market, and have leveraged resulting insights into ROI-driven marketing and advertising plans. These destinations include Fort Lauderdale, the state of Florida, New York City, the state of New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland Oregon, Chicago, Dallas and many others. Hawaii has yet to make this commitment.\" \nThe LGBT Hawai`i plan is dedicated to helping to make this research happen, so that all the hotels, attractions and other tourism infrastructure can benefit from the direction and findings of such a study. The investment is comparatively minimal, while the potential return is huge. \nThe LGBT travel market represents approximately $100 billion in the USA alone. Research for Visit Philadelphia found that for every $1 the city invested into LGBT outreach, $153 was returned in terms of hotels, restaurants, shopping, attractions, etc. \nAfter 119 Hawai`i businesses pledged to support LGBT Hawaii, the organization is optimistic this could be a trigger for dialog with HTA to discuss funding the needed research as a base to better understand understand how to attract the lucrative international LGBT market. \nOn August 19, 2015, LGBT HAWAI`I enjoyed a very successful formation meeting of 42 LGBT owned or supportive state businesses as guests of the Hilton Waikiki Beach Hotel. The core group has since grown to 119 businesses representing virtually every segment of the tourism industry in Hawaii.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T07:43:25.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
