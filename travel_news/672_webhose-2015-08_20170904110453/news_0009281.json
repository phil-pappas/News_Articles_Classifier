The latest route is part of the airline’s strategy to expand across Southern Africa, making Lusaka a hub for air travel throughout the region. Proflight will fly three times a week to Durban from September 22, using its 50-seater CRJ-100 aircraft. If demand proves strong then the airline hopes to add a fourth weekly flight to the Lusaka-Durban schedule. P0024 will leave Lusaka at 11:00hrs on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, arriving in Durban at 13:30hrs. The returning P0025 flight will leave Durban at 14:10hrs on Tuesdays and Thursdays arriving in Lusaka at 16:40hrs. On Sundays P0023 will leave Durban- at 12:00hrs and arrive back in Lusaka at 13:3hrs. This means travellers from Lusaka and elsewhere in Proflight’s extensive network will be able to attend to business in Durban, go shopping, visit the sea and spend time on the beach, visit family and friends, go to concerts and shows, and attend rugby, football and cricket matches. \nThe new service will also enable South Africa visitors to more easily visit Lusaka for business and to enjoy Zambia’s tourist attractions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:36:27.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
