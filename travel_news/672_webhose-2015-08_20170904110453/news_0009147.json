In 1990, a Chilean court found a single former officer guilty of negligence in the case.\nThe case received special attention in the United States, however, because Rojas lived in Washington with his mother, Veronica de Negri, a Chilean exile.\nIt was brought directly to the attention of then president Ronald Reagan.\nA secret White House report for the president, also declassified Friday, said Chilean intelligence had “fingered army personnel as clearly involved.”\nAccording to Peter Kornbluh, an analyst at the National Security Archive, Rojas’s murder was the last straw for Washington and led to Reagan’s decision in 1989 to pressure for a return to democracy in Chile.\nMore than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared at the hands of the Chilean security forces during the Pinochet regime, which lasted from 1973 to 1990.", "external_links": ["http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T23:17:50.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
