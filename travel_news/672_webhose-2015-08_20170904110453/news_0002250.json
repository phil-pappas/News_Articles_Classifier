(Mary Bergin / Chicago Tribune) Illinois Department of Transportation Your ferry awaits at river crossings in the Midwest \nAbout 130 bridges cross the Mississippi River, but there is another way to take a car over the waterway, which at 2,300-plus miles is among the longest in the world. \nFerries shuttle people and vehicles on this river and others, but the vessels are increasingly rare because of new bridges, funding cuts for ferry operations and the impact of weather, flooding and floating debris on ferry schedules. Rides are scenic but not always possible. \nThe Mississippi River's oldest continually operating ferry began service in 1853 between Canton, Mo., and Meyer, Ill. Service stopped in 2014 because the barge, best known for hauling millions of bushels of farmers' grain per year, was deemed too expensive to repair. Ole Time Barbecue is a quirky, family-run roadside eatery about 15 minutes from downtown Raleigh, N.C. It has 10 booths and tables, some counter seats and an open diner-style kitchen. From the road, you can't miss its bright yellow roof. ( Irene S. Levine ) \nOnly 11 public ferries still work the Mississippi. That includes The Pride of Cassville Car Ferry, which takes 17 minutes to link Cassville, Wis., with Clayton County, Iowa. When ferry service began there in 1833, it was on a flat, wooden boat that was oared. Two horses on a treadmill propelled the ferry 25 years later; that's how people, mail and vegetables were transported until gas engines replaced the animals around 1912. \nCassville was without ferry service for 40 years, until 1982, and now the village owns and operates the vessel from May through October. Hours depend on time of year and the river level. \nSome passengers walk on to ride \"a moving monument\" to river life, said the Rev. Don Zahurance, a Cassville minister, Chicago native and part-time deckhand. \"We get some beautiful sunset rides here,\" but don't be fooled into believing the sun sets in the north. It only looks that way because the river runs east and west here. 8 \n\"Looping the loop\" is popular with motorists because on either side of the river is the Great River Road National Scenic Byway. A one-way ferry ride is $2 for a walk-on rider and $12-$15 for a car or van. Hauling capacity is 98 tons. 608-725-5180, www.cassville.org \nYou can still find unusual river ferries in the Midwest. During busy travel weekends, the wait to board or move at the following five locations might be significantly longer than the ride, however. \nTwo free ferries cross the Illinois River and are operated by the Illinois Department of Transportation. The Brussels Ferry (618-786-3636) at Illinois Highway 100 is near Pere Marquette State Park and links Calhoun County with Grafton, Ill. The Kampsville Ferry (618-653-4518) at Illinois Highway 108 connects Eldred and Kampsville, Ill. Both operate 24/7 unless river flooding or freezing interferes; 28 miles (and one bridge) are between the two docks. www.visitalton.com \nMerrimac Ferry crosses the Wisconsin River at Wisconsin Highway 113 between Merrimac and Okee and since 1933 is run by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. The season typically is 24 hours per day from April 15 through Nov. 30. Up to 15 vehicles at one time take the free ride, which lasts seven minutes. www.tn.merrimac.wi.gov/ferry.htm , dial 511 for ferry updates. 0 \nSaugatuck Chain Ferry, around since 1838 and purported to be the only chain-driven ferry in the nation, crosses the Kalamazoo River in downtown Saugatuck, Mich. There is room only for passengers, the cost is $1, and the ride takes five minutes and about 200 hand-turned cranks by the captain to go 100 yards. Up to 24 ride at once, from late May through Labor Day. www.saugatuck.com , 269-857-4261 \nFor boats in northern Wisconsin, the Burnt Rollways Boat Hoist electrically transports vessels between the Three Lakes Chain of Lakes and Eagle River Chain of Lakes. Fishermen have maneuvered Eagle River this way since 1911, and \"burnt rollways\" is a reference to a long-ago lumberjacking protest. The cost is $10 per boat to be moved along a 165-foot-long trestle, above a river dam in Oneida County. This happens from late May to late September. Wisconsin Valley Improvement Co., the operator, sometimes requires reservations. Without a wait, the process lasts less than 15 minutes. 715-218-6514, www.wvic.com \nMary Bergin is a freelance writer. \nOther Mississippi River ferries \nHere are the 10 other Mississippi River ferries.
