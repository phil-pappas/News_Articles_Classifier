The Luci inflatable solar lantern helps solve this. Its 5-inch-diameter silver disk has solar panels and an on-off switch on one side and 10 LED lights on the other. A heavy plastic blow-up cylindrical “bulb” sits on top of the LEDs and inflates to 4 inches tall. It charges in eight hours of direct sunlight and shines brightly for hours.
