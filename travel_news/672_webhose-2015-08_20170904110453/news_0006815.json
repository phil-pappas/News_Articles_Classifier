At the bottom of the hill the road ended in a small clearing with no sign of the turning that would take me back to civilisation. All I could see was more forest and a narrow path leading into a bog. In April, I set off to cycle 3000km of the North Sea Cycle Route, from Den Haag in Holland to Bergen in Norway. The trip started as an adventure for me, a 50-plus woman with a desire to test my boundaries. I added a further challenge by using it to raise funds to help my disabled sister Katherine, who lives in England, buy a much-needed £8000 wheelchair. I left England on a Sunday afternoon aboard an overnight ferry from Harwich. With me were my adult children, Josh and Rosie, who were going to ride with me for five days to Groningen. By the time we rolled off the ferry at Den Haag the fundraising had topped £1000 – it continued to outstrip my expectations for the next two months. Caroline Crick \nFjord at Feda, Norway. \nThe sense of purpose it gave me on the ride was a wonderful gift, far exceeding anything I could do for Katherine. \nHolland is to cyclists what pinot noir is to wine lovers. Wide cycle paths led us through rolling sand dunes, we pedalled miles of dykes with the sea to our left and farmland to our right, and rode through spotless villages that looked like they'd been vacuumed that morning. \nAt one point, as we rode out of a forest, a wall of scent hit and we found ourselves surrounded by pink, blue and purple-striped fields of hyacinths in full bloom. Battalions of wind turbines were our constant companions, and for the first few days the wind was at our backs, pushing us along a 25km dyke across the Waddenzee at great speed. Not long after that the temperature dropped, the wind turned northerly, and I got a taste of things to come. Camping was a trial, and continued to be throughout the trip, with a few wonderful exceptions. The campsites of Europe to a large degree worship the mighty Campervan God and I had to keep reminding myself, as we huddled behind a toilet block or tried to cook dinner on our gas cooker under a windswept lean-to, that we were not their target market. In Groningen I farewelled the kids and my youngest sister Julia took up the baton for a week as we battled our way north-eastwards along the German coast from Emden to Hamburg, into the increasingly trying northerly winds. Sally Newton \nWriter Caroline Crick riding along the beach, Blokhus Strand, Denmark. \nWe rode along the dykes, ate enormous apple cakes with our morning coffee and brewed tea by the side of country lanes. \nIt was springtime and the fruit trees in Stade were a riot of blossom as we rode along the canals towards Hamburg. \nThe low point of the week was a campsite somewhere south of Bremerhaven, where we built a makeshift kitchen from two rotting picnic tables and Julia took the dishes in to the shower with her to wash them. \nWhen I said goodbye to Julia at Hamburg airport she bit her bottom lip and didn't cry, but 10 minutes later sent me a text message saying: \"You didn't go to the loo before you left. Who will watch your bike now?\" Ad Feedback \nI had a day of rest with friends in Bremen and then caught the train to Elmshorn. \nIt was cold and spitting with rain and as I tried to orientate myself on the map, I realised my hands were shaking, partly with the cold and partly with the nerves of doing this on my own. \nIt was a Sunday afternoon, there was no one around and I felt so alone. \nI got on the bike and started riding in any direction just to get moving. After a couple of circuits of the town I crossed the right railway bridge and found the right road out of town. \nI found I had to make an effort to talk to people and make connections; otherwise it was too easy to ride along in my bubble like a goldfish forever swimming on the other side of a glass wall. \nWhen I stopped and asked questions, talked to people, they were unstintingly kind and generous. \nIn Esbjerg I met up with my old friend Sally, a red headed bundle of energy and enthusiasm, and we rode the coast of Denmark together. \nAfter my previous uninspiring camping experiences, we tried to stay in small, family-owned campsites and hostels. \nWe had a hard job convincing people that we weren't a couple and did, actually, need two shower tokens. \nSeveral times I had to drag Sally from her tent unreasonably early in the morning to get everything packed up before the rain hit. We spent part of her 64 th birthday huddled under some stunted pine trees, hiding from a thunderstorm. \nBut one day we rode 90km, blown up the coast to Thyboron by an unstinting southerly. \nWe stumbled across a mediaeval castle and wandered through the grounds thinking it was a museum, until the owner appeared and asked us what on earth we were doing. \nWe endured the worst weather of the whole ride: wet, windy, freezing cold, ploughing through slushy gravelled forestry roads, and made it to Skagen where we watched the Kattegat and Skagerrak seas meeting. \nDenmark was a rewarding place to ride – lots of history, beautiful coastlines, interesting bird life and not too much in the way of hills. \nAnd then, before I knew it, we were on the ferry to Varberg, from where I headed north and Sally went south to Copenhagen and home. \nOnce again I found myself alone. \nThe route from Varberg to Gothenburg was memorable for its busy roads and bad signage – a shock after the great riding conditions so far. \nIn Gothenburg I explored the beautiful old city before catching a train north to Stenungsund to skip the worst of the city roads. \nThis part of Sweden was much prettier but much hillier, the roads were busier and lacking anything in the way of cycle lanes or hard shoulders to ride on – it was just like cycling along a busy state highway in New Zealand. \nIn Stromstad I holed up in a hostel for two nights, bargaining with the owner to get the price down to something I could afford. \nMy daily budget had seemed generous in Holland and Germany but had to stretch further as I travelled north. \nI lived on porridge, bananas, bread and cheese, rice and beans, and as many Danish pastries as I could afford. \nThe sun came out on my day off so I walked around a wooded peninsula, the waters of the fjord around it clear as a bell and blue as the sky. \nI left refreshed the next day to ride along quiet rolling roads through forest and farms, stopping to walk through the Blomsholm Stone Ship ancient standing stones – I really was in Viking country. \nI still needed to get maps for Norway – the route guide I was looking for seemed to be unavailable in bookshops. I couldn't get hold of the publisher and knew by then that I couldn't rely on route signage. \nAt the Danish-Norwegian border, a North Sea Cycle Route signpost appeared, so I followed that. When the signs ran out (as they always did) I used my phone's GPS to navigate my way to Fredrikstad. \nHere I managed to buy a \"rough guide\" to the route but it was not detailed enough for serious navigating. I used Google maps to fill in the gaps, gobbling data like no-one's business. \nThe dead-end forestry track experience resulted in man-handling my bike and gear through 800m of bog so when, in Kristiansand, I finally got hold of the map for the rest of the Norway route it was a huge relief. (Note to self, don't leave home without all the maps for your route!) \nFrom Kristiansand to Bergen was the most challenging, beautiful and rewarding riding of the whole trip. \nThe geology resembled an egg carton and my days consisted of riding from sea level to mountaintop to sea level, repeat. It was exhausting and exhilarating. \nI revelled in the feeling of vulnerability and excitement, in riding through a remote, challenging place alone. \nI cycled old quiet roads through forested valleys, alongside magnificent fjords, above which hung rocky buttresses smoothed by the passing of ancient glaciers. \nTiny mountain farms were home to sheep of all colours, their neck bells clanking as they grazed, while cuckoo calls echoed through the valleys. \nThe roadside was speckled with the pinks and whites of wild campion, thrift and cow parsley - it was like riding through a Renaissance tapestry with sound effects. \nOn June 6, just before Flekkefjord, I hit the 3000km mark. The fundraising had reached £5836 and was still climbing, and I felt a great sense of achievement. \nI'd been in regular contact with Katherine and that had helped keep me going through the tough days, knowing that people really were behind me as I rode. It made all the difference at times. \nOn the mountain above Jossingfjord, I pedalled uphill through 300m of unlit tunnel, cars behind me sounding like trains and all my high-vis gear and lights deployed. \nWhen I came out the other side there was a New Zealand flag flying in a layby next to a Norwegian one. \nIt marked a memorial to four New Zealand airmen who lost their lives in an Allied air raid in 1945. I was stunned to see a link to home, immensely proud and humbled. \nBy the time I got to Stavanger I had ridden 3210km and was ready for a rest. I'd realised I wouldn't get all the way to Bergen in the time available, and instead used my one spare day to walk up to Pulpit Rock in the fog; it seemed a fitting end to my ride. \nI caught the bus from Stavanger to Bergen and my big sister Sue was waiting at the bus station for me. It was very good to see her. \nTo my delight we raised £7000 towards Katherine's wheelchair. \nAnd for myself, I found in the bright days the joy of exploration and adventure. On the dark days I learned about keeping on pedalling, regardless. Because, in the end, the hardestchallenges reap the most memorable rewards. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T00:25:00.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
