Issuing level 2 advisories – meaning to take extra care during travel – are 12 countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the US. \n\nLevel 3 advisories, meaning to take an even greater level of care during travel, were the next most common with nine nations issuing the order. They include Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Russia and the UK. \n\nThe Netherlands issued a level 1 advisory, urging its citizens to merely be aware of the ongoing situation in Thailand. \n\nHong Kong on the other hand, issued a high level 4 advisory, the second highest alert possible for the nation, asking its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the kingdom. \n\nThe Philippines issued no travel advisories, with the Department of Foreign Affairs saying they needed more time before making a decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T08:21:03.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
