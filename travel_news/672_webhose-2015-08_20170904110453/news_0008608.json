A beach in Benidorm was closed this week after a boy was bitten by what may have been a shark, although experts have cast doubt on whether one was actually involved. “The nature of the wound shown in media coverage points to something other than a shark being responsible,” said John Richardson of the Shark Trust. Nonetheless, a 30-year-old woman was bitten by a tiger shark in the same spot last summer. Also in 2014, swimming was banned, and tourists warned to be on their guard, at popular beaches in the south of France and Corsica for several days after blue sharks were seen in shallow waters in July. But blue sharks very rarely attack humans, and only nine attacks on humans have been recorded – almost all against divers who were spearfishing and had attached dead fish to their belts. • Shark attacks around the world: mapped • Why we should be worried about the rise in shark attacks Blue sharks very rarely attack humans, and only nine attacks on humans have been recorded – almost all against divers who were spearfishing and had attached dead fish to their belts. Photo: Alamy More dangerous are great whites, who have been blamed for the odd attack on tourists off the coast of Italy, although there have only been 10 sightings in the last 30 years, according to reports. A photo which some thought to be a young great white near Magaluf last year was said by others to most likely be a large tuna. The Med actually contains around 47 different species of shark, including the fearsome great white. Some are deep-sea species, commonly found at depths greater than 200m, meaning only researchers and commercial fishermen are likely to encounter them. “Others range from the filter-feeding basking shark – reaching up to 12m in length, to the shortfin mako – the fastest shark in the ocean, as well as hammerheads, threshers, catsharks and dogfish,” said Mr Richardson. “But as in many other parts of the world, Mediterranean shark populations face a growing barrage of threats – including overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. Consequently a number of species are now listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List – meaning they have an elevated risk of extinction in the Mediterranean. • How to survive a shark attack \"This includes the blue shark. Thought to be one of the most abundant sharks on the planet – and a seasonal visitor to British waters – it was recently upgraded to Critically Endangered in the region.“ The US has historically had the most shark attacks in the world, with 1,999 recorded since the year 1900, according to statistics on the website SharkAttackData.com. Australia follows as the next most deadly nation for shark attacks, with 1,237. In Europe, Italy has had the most recorded shark attacks. Surprisingly, perhaps, the UK comes next, with a total of 38 attacks since 1900, followed by Spain with 33. These aren’t great numbers but there are enough sharks in UK waters for the Wildlife Trusts to campaign for the creation of a marine protected area at Manacles in Cornwall, where there is “very good evidence (from Seaquest South West and the Marine Strandings Network) that this is one of the UK’s basking shark hotspots.” Video shot in Cornwall last year shows one such shark swimming past a snorkeller with its mouth gaping open. Basking sharks, some up to 8m long, are also occasionally sighted in waters around the Isle of Man.
