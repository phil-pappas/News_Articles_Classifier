From September 5 to September 7, Americans will be celebrating the last three-day weekend of the year. If you're looking for a fun and unusual way to close out the summer, why not take a a sightseeing flight tour of the Grand Canyon? Since Labor Day is almost here, you need to make your plans now and get your tour booked by next week. Las Vegas Air ToursWhen you depart from Las Vegas, you can take a landing tour or an air-only tours. Landing tours are the most fun, especially the one that flies down to the canyon floor and lands by the Colorado River. A lot of people like this tour because it comes with a champagne picnic and you can add on a boat ride for some extra fun. You can even do more fun things. You could also add on a landing on top of the rim. That will give the chance to explore the area on foot and experience the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is an amazing structure made of steel and glass that allows you to stand suspended thousands of feet above the floor of the canyon. You'll have one of the best views possible of the canyon, and it's a perfect complement to an aerial tour. If you plan to travel with a fairly large group, or if you need to buy an economical tour, then you may want to book an airplane tour instead of a helicopter tour. Airplanes can't fly down to the canyon floor, but they fly along the same flight path as helicopters, so you'll see the same sights from a higher altitude. If you want to take a tour of the South Rim, then taking an airplane tour is the ideal way to get from Vegas to the South Rim. South Rim Air ToursIf you fly from Vegas on a plane to the airport in Tusayan near the South Rim, or if you drive to Tusayan, you can pick from two air tour options. One gives you thirty minutes of air time and flies over to the North Rim and circles back. The other tour is highly recommended because it give you 50 minutes of flight time. It flies over the South and North Rims as well as the land over to the eastern edge of the Grand Canyon National Park. In fact, you'll get to see about 75 percent of the entire park on this tour.Helicopters cannot land on the canyon floor at the South Rim, but you can add on a fun Jeep tour instead. If you do that, you'll get a 2 1/2 hour 4x4 ride through the park see the sights up close. Getting to see the park from the ground is an experience you don't want to miss. Basic And Deluxe ToursThe basic tours cost the least. They fly on AStar and Bell Ranger choppers. While they are perfectly adequate aircraft, if you can afford it, it is worth the cost to upgrade to a deluxe tour. The deluxe helicopter tours fly on EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. They are designed for tourism sightseeing, so they offer for creature comforts. The bucket seats are arranged in a stadium style, so you get a great view no matter where you sit. They are also roomier and quieter, but the big advantage is the massive wraparound window that gives you panoramic views. Another perk of deluxe tours is that they come with free shuttle transportation from your Vegas hotel to the helipad located on the Strip. The airplane tours fly on Twin Otter airplanes, and they carry up to 19 people per tour. The airplanes also have large viewing windows so you can see as much scenery as possible from your seat in the cabin.
