The company partnered with NRG Renew LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NRG), the country’s largest independent power producers, to install a 6.4 MWdc (MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) array on the rooftop of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, spanning 20 acres. This was the first project of its kind in Las Vegas, paving the way for large solar installations across the hospitality industry.\n“It’s an honor to be named a finalist in this category, as we strive to be good stewards of the environment. As a company, we have a responsibility to help conserve our planet’s natural resources,” said Cindy Ortega, Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer. “We are proud to have partnered with NRG Renew on a project that will have far-reaching effects on our company, Las Vegas and the hospitality industry.”\n“We were proud to partner with MGM Resorts when the opportunity for this array came about, and it’s been exciting to be a part of MGM’s leadership in its industry,” said Tom Doyle, President and CEO of NRG Renew. “The recognition this project and our companies are receiving from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation validates NRG Renew and MGM’s commitment to a clean energy future.”\nThrough the use of the solar array, MGM Resorts is able to remove 6,300 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the equivalent to taking 1,300 cars off the road annually.\nA 350,000-square-foot expansion of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center will be completed in Fall 2015. It will incorporate an additional rooftop solar PV array, further stretching what is already the largest convention center solar array in the world. Upon completion, the added portion of the array will generate approximately 1.9 MW with an approximate annual production of 3.4M kilowatt hours. The combined array will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of 1,300 homes.\nThe 2015 Citizens Awards encompass eight categories that honor corporate citizenship best practices. The Best Environmental Stewardship Program category is for companies that exemplify the ability of the business sector to engage effectively in communities to better the environment. These companies have proven that the business sector has the ability and the desire to create impact.\nThe winners of the 2015 Citizens Awards will be selected by a committee of corporate peers and field experts and announced on Oct. 6 at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.\nSource: MGM Resorts International", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:57:29.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
