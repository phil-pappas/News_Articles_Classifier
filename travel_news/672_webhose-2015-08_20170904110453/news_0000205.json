It’s not straightforward with Corey,” Bennett said.\nBRISBANE BOOST: Kahu turns down big bucks for Broncos\nNRL SUPERCOACH ANALYSIS: Cartwright buy of the week\n“Right now he is playing some wing. He has just got to do better with repeat efforts, you can’t play NRL and not do multiple repeat efforts, it’s a case of him maturing a bit more and he will get there.\n“We don’t have Frank Molo, we’ve lost Josh and Adam so we have (three) major hit-up forwards missing.\n“That’s the Dogs’ strength. I’m confident enough we can match them, we’ll have to do that and we’ll have to be on our game.\n“They are a quality football team and they wouldn’t be happy where they are, they are better team than that.\n“They will be keen tomorrow night and we’ll have our hands full.”\nCorey Oates at Brisbane Broncos training.

We had to address things.\n“We’re probably not playing with the consistency we were a month ago. Our performance last week was coming, it was just a matter of when it came, I hope it’s a timely reminder for them all to pick their act up.”\nOriginally published as Oates starts as Bennett tweaks Broncos line-up", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227472/439681-57a3ae78-3bde-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/broncos-v-bulldogs-corey-oates-starts-as-wayne-bennett-tweaks-brisbane-line-up/story-fnia3gmj-1227472439709"], "published": "2015-08-06T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:51:50.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
