Another highlight of Extreme Bike Tours’ flagship tours is the remote and wild Nubra Valley – a desolately beautiful and high-altitude cold desert frequented by hardy nomads and rare, twin-humped camels.\nGuests will ride classic Indian Royal Enfield Bullet 500 motorbikes across 1300km of remote and spectacular roads in far north India and see gushing waterfalls, ancient monasteries cloaked by prayer flags and soaring, snow-capped peaks. Accommodation amongst the world’s loftiest mountains will be in a combination of tents, rustic guesthouses and hotels along the road.\nThe two Mighty Himalayan tours departing June 18 and July 5, 2016, are available for US$4334 per rider or US$3371 for pillion passengers sitting behind crew/drivers or in the support vehicle.
