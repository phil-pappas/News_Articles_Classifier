These goods and services include food, lodging, recreation, gifts, entertainment, local transportation in the United States, and other items incidental to foreign travel. Travel receipts accounted for slightly more than 62 percent of total U.S. travel and tourism exports during June 2015. \nPassenger Fare Receipts: Fares received by U.S. carriers from international visitors totaled $3.3 billion for the month, a decrease of nearly 10 percent when compared to June 2014. Falling fuel prices have contributed to declining fares. Passenger fare receipts accounted for 17 percent of total U.S. travel and tourism exports during June. \nMedical/Education/Short-Term Worker(1): Expenditures for educational and health-related tourism, along with all expenditures by border, seasonal, and other short-term workers, totaled $3.8 billion in June, an increase of 10 percent when compared to the same period last year. Medical tourism, education, and short-term worker receipts accounted for 20 percent of total U.S. travel and tourism exports during June 2015. Composition of Monthly International Visitor Spending: June 2015 \nYear-to-date international visitor spending is up 1 percent, totaling $112.2 billion for the first six months of 2015. Conversely, U.S. resident spending abroad is up nearly 7 percent during the same period (January through June), having spent $76.1 billion on imported travel and tourism-related goods and services, resulting in a $36.0 billion trade surplus for travel and tourism year to date. \nNTTO Note on Annual Revisions \nOn June 18, 2015 the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released annual revisions of the U.S. international transactions data, of which travel and tourism-related spending are a part; as a result, we have revised annual international visitor spending data for 2012, 2013, and 2014. \nIn 2014 international visitors spent $220.8 billion (revised) experiencing the United States, an increase of 3 percent when compared to the previous year. These travel and tourism exports accounted for 31 percent of all U.S. services exports and 9 percent of all U.S. exports, goods and services alike. \nUnfortunately, the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) is no longer able to report annual travel and tourism export figures (international visitor spending in the United States) by country until October of each year. The National Travel and Tourism Office relies on data provided by BEA (e.g., spending by visitors from China on U.S. flag carriers) to report these country-specific data. Previously, BEA released these preliminary data in March; now, however, BEA will not publish these data until October. As a result, the National Travel and Tourism Office will necessarily alter its reporting schedule accordingly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T12:28:12.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
