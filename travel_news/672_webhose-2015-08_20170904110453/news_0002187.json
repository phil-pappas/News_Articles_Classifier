These were in addition to security, connectivity, sustainability and manpower factors, he said.\nHe said as the chairman of ASEAN, Malaysia was willing to take the leadership role to better align policy and strategic planning at the ASEAN level to promote intra-ASEAN tourism, as well as to attract more tourist arrivals from emerging economies.\n“Connectivity would be the key enabler to ensure people can travel safely, securely and efficiently and the government is currently focusing on enhancing connectivity with the medium-haul markets of China, Japan, Australia, India, Korea and Taiwan.\n“This is in line with our goal to target high net-worth tourists and the Transport Ministry is championing this entry point project,” he said in his opening keynote address read out by the ministry’s secretary-general, Tan Sri Dr Ong Hong Peng, at the Tourism Summit 2015, in Kuala Lumpur, on July 30.\nNazri said some of the areas to be examined included air service agreements, border security policies and travel facilitation initiatives, as well as airport capacity development and management.\n“More than 90 per cent of business and leisure travellers begin to plan their travel using search engine and this innovative technology has revolutionised the entire travel and tourism experience, and social media has played a key enabling role.\n“Malaysia is intensifying marketing and promotional efforts, especially in the digital space, and has launched aggressive plans to recover the Chinese market through the digital sphere.\nAccording to Nazri, sustainable or green tourism would also help the industry to promote awareness and conservation efforts with respect to the environment, as well as improving the welfare of the local communities involved, while at the same time benefiting businesses and consumers.\nThe ministry also emphasised on medical tourism as healthcare travel service providers had borne fruit, making the country one of the top five destinations for medical tourism in 2012 and delivered 770,000 medical tourists in 2013, said Nazri.\n“I am also proud of Kuala Lumpur’s achievement in being recognised as the fourth best shopping destination globally after New York, Tokyo and London by CNN Travel in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:30:58.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
