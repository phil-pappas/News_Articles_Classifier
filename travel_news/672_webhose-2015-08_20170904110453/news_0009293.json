I will be travelling to Hong Kong with my family (two adults and two teenage boys) for six nights in December. What can you suggest? The boys like amusement parks, Mum likes shopping malls, I like open markets and a bit of sightseeing. What's the best way to get about and should I take a mix of cash and a credit card for spending? \nA. Visit The Peak, the highest point in Hong Kong, or Sky100 observation deck for views across the city. Walk along Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade past the cultural centre, museums and the clock tower on Kowloon. Check out the Symphony of Lights, a laser show held every night at 8pm at the harbour. Hong Kong has numerous shopping centres. Enjoy open-air markets like Mong Kok and the Stanley Market which will give you a real local flavour. Your children would love to visit Hong Kong Disneyland or Ocean Park, which is a marine-themed park offering thrill rides and animal exhibits. Public transport is the best way to get around, using train (called the MTR), bus, tram and ferries. Buy a prepaid Octopus card from an MTR Station. Credit card is widely accepted but it's useful to carry cash for smaller purchases. \n- Christine Gilliver, travel specialist, House of Travel, Hornby \nGot a travel question? We can help.
