With Michael Clarke retiring at the end of the series , the process of regeneration is already starting but Lehmann’s boss at Cricket Australia has said he will not lose his job in any subsequent clearout, despite rumours of problems behind the scenes on this tour. James Sutherland, the chief executive of Cricket Australia, has promised a full review of the England tour and the team's performance director, Pat Howard, has been on the trip closely observing what has been going on. Michael Clarke has already announced his forthcoming retirement from international cricket Sutherland answered firmly “yes” when asked by reporters in Melbourne if Lehmann’s job is safe but admitted the team has to improve its performances overseas. \"We'll sit down and review that, and the cricket experts will review that and no doubt others,\" Sutherland said. \"That's an opportunity for reflection on style of play, and all of that. We all understand that it's not easy playing away, but it's something that we've clearly got to get better at . We have the highest aspirations for the Australian cricket team.\" Lehmann incurred the wrath of Australian fans on Twitter when he tweeted asking for help in getting tickets to watch Liverpool versus Stoke. “Maybe better off analyzing Ben Stokes not Stoke City,” wrote one fan. Lehmann went to the match and hit back at his critics: ”Thanks so much for the abuse, was asking a question that people might help. Don't bother now! Thanks again people for being so abusive.\" Telegraphsportpage Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T21:47:21.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
