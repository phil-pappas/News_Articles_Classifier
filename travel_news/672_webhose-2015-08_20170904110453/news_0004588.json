It put the estimated black market value at about 400,000 francs ($413,000). \nThe elephant tusks had been sawed into 172 pieces to fit into the luggage, which was being transported from Tanzania’s capital, Dar es Salaam, to Beijing via Zurich. The head of the customs operation at the airport, Heinz Widmer, said officials estimate that the pieces came from 40 to 50 elephants. \nDemand from China’s rising middle class has been fuelling elephant poaching in Africa and illegal trade in ivory, which is turned into jewellery and other decorative items. \nThe Chinese men were temporarily detained in Zurich and questioned, Widmer said. They could face large fines for violating customs and animal protection rules. \nThe suitcases also contained 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of lion fangs and claws — 21 fangs and 35 claws. They could be used as jewellery or talismans, or as a symbol for strength in Chinese traditional medicine, Widmer said. \nThe ivory haul, while sizable, is below the 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) threshold considered to be a large-scale seizure that indicates the likely involvement of organized crime, according to TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring organization. \nThe group, which said that it doesn’t speculate on the black-market value of ivory as a matter of policy, said the frequency of large-scale seizures has increased greatly since 2000, with 18 such hauls reported in 2013. \nIn May, a senior Chinese official made an unexpected pledge to halt the ivory trade inside the country, though it isn’t clear how and when that ban might take effect. \nTanzania’s Chief of the International Police (Interpol) Mr. Gustav Babile said his office was in contact with Swiss authorities to assess the report of the bloody ivory seizure. \nDirector of Wildlife in Tanzania’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism Mr. Herman Keraryo was quoted saying the government of Tanzania was working with Zurich for more details.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:48:30.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
