As the terrorising tremors of Avicii ’s turbo-charged EDM shake the main stage, the Argentinian performance group De Le Guarda reduce their crowd to bug-eyed babies, cooing at every trick turned out during their insane aerial extravaganza, FuerzaBruta . There are Stomp-like drums, sprinklers that drench unsuspecting audience members, and gymnasts whose bodies fly across the amphitheatre, their flailing limbs tangled and twisted like insects’ tentacles. This is Hungary’s Sziget , winner of the best major festival category at this year’s European festival awards , where music is secondary to the grownup play parks and circus-like chaos in every field.\nThe week-long event – that’s seven whole days of portable loos and living in profoundly hot tents – takes place in bucolic woodland on an island on the Danube, in Budapest . Billing itself as the Island of Freedom, Sziget was founded in 1993, following the collapse of communism – and it’s an event that promotes itself as a haven for liberation and unity (the campsite asks festival-goers to donate their tents to immigrants if they are not taking them home).\nFuerzabruta in action Given its aspirational name of Eurowoodstock in 1994, as well as being dubbed Hungary’s answer to Glastonbury and Burning Man , I expected to find a bohemian utopia full of nude blokes and bongos. But contrary to its comparisons, the atmosphere here is more intense and youthful, a fast-paced and high-energy experience packed with colour and kerazyness: instead of bearded Grateful Dead devotees, buff bros in lurid “Sziget Fucked” vests do pull-ups in an outdoor gym. Cash is worthless at Sziget: instead you’re made to purchase deep-fried foods and buckets of booze using contactless top-up cards.\nUnlike Glastonbury, the festival is entirely curdled by capitalism – from its H&M sponsored area to the MasterCard world music stage, and the onsite Superga store. However, once you’ve accepted it’s not going to be a pure, unfettered idyll, these factors become less intrusive. Besides, corporate blood has always charged through its veins: from 1996 to 2001 it was renamed Pepsi Sziget. It does share one thing with Burning Man and Glastonbury, though: white dudes with dreadlocks. At Sziget there is even a dreadlock cabin, should you wish to change your hairstyle onsite, as well as a tattoo and piercing cabin for those brave enough to spontaneously put needle to flesh.\nI arrived midway through this year’s festival, but the audience – approximately 80,000 day tickets on Monday and about 415,000 in total – seem utterly unaffected by the challenges of surviving in the dusty, squat-like environment. Unlike British festivals, picnic blanket culture is non-existent: the crowd here are mostly in their 20s and incredibly enthusiastic. Interaction is encouraged. Every other hour a jet of water hits you on the back of the head. It takes a while to adjust to the fact that it’s the splash of clean Hungarian aqua from a water pistol, rather than a warm bottle of piss.\n Festival-goers enjoy the colour party.

Robbie Williams, Florence + the Machine, Alt-J, Ellie Goulding, Avicii, Kings of Leon and Martin Garrix are all headlining the main stage (with Robbie one of the week’s biggest draws). Dotted across the days there are moments of coolness – the Horrors’ moody mid-afternoon slot ends with Faris Badwan climbing over the barriers and into the audience, before disappearing into the event. In spite of a brief power cut, Foals’ performance is fantastically groovy, while Jamie Woon’s sultry soul suits the sweaty tent it takes place in. Also on site is an afro-Latin-reggae village – which is an excellent antidote to the mainstream – as well as hundreds of smaller, international bands in smaller areas and DJs blasting out electronica at mini-stages set up across the site.\nPerhaps the feelgood vibes of the crowd are infectious, but there is a lot of fun to be had watching some of the more populist acts: the Script work the punters into a frenzy during their ludicrously sentimental and bombastic set on Wednesday. Goulding, Thursday night’s headliner, is also a consummate performer – her saccharine pop sounding euphoric on such a large-scale stage. Alt-J’s wiry sounds are beefed up by furiously talented Thom Green on drums and Kasabian are devilishly daft and fun, urging the audience to form a moshpit as they cover Cameo’s Word Up . Tom Meighan tells the febrile crowd to “hold on to your arseholes” before they launch into Fire. Sziget has an enormous Irish following, too, meaning the Dropkick Murphys show on Friday night is a sweaty, pumped-up barrage of Celtic punk full of barging boys with their tops off. Like Primavera, the festival becomes increasingly lively as midnight approaches and rattles on into the next day. Most of the locals arrive on site at around 10.30pm, by which point the big industrial construction near the art area hosts a dry-ice filled rave.\nAnd if it all gets a bit too hectic – a number of ticket-holders plough through the site on scooters, which can make Sziget feel a little Mad Max in the dry heat, while raucous street performers crusade across the walkways – there is a beautiful beach at the tip of the island called the Chill Garden. The Luminarium (an 800sq-metre inflatable sculpture, with labyrinthine tunnels to run about in) is good for a womb-like retreat, and the arts and crafts area (including a small gallery of paintings, all of which appear to be phallic, but perhaps the beating sun was skewering my vision) is a quiet and serene space. There is even a TED Talk zone for those wishing to tap out of the silliness and consider their future as a young entrepreneur.\nA roving street performer and his puppet In terms of visual spectacle, the “secret” events on the main stage can be pretty wonderful. At 7pm every day there’s a flash mob-style event, from mass bubble-blowing to a flag party (everyone enthusiastically waved their flags for 15 solid minutes), and even a paint and confetti party (for those keen on getting plastered in coloured powder and bits of paper). It’s not all about getting mucky and having a laugh, however – these events come with an earnest message, according to a man on a microphone who ramps up the crowd, saying we’re going to start a revolution on a “mission of one love and unity”. How 20,000 people shaking maracas might help the debt crisis is yet to be revealed, but this is a festival at which cynicism is pointless.\nThere are some 91 nationalities at this year’s festival, with its international audience expanding rapidly. Perhaps because of its global audience, Sziget has a gap-year-like atmosphere, full of well-groomed kids who are after a safe journey of self-discovery and adventure. What it lacks in deep, authentic spirituality and hedonistic escapism, though, it makes up for with the crowd, who provide constant energy and willingness, unravaged by drugs and excessive boozing and game for whatever organised fun the festival offers them. Sziget is less about revolution and more about embracing the ridiculousness of life and getting carried away in the carnival, water gun in one hand, contactless top-up card in the other.\nHarriet Gibsone’s trip to Sziget was arranged and paid for by the festival", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/6XGwZdrt19/?taken-by=harrietgibsone", "http://szigetfestival.com/programs/?searchenginerUrl=festival_english/programs/#!programmation=artist$miracoco-luminarium/1584", "http://mashable.com/2015/04/01/european-festival-guide/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Sziget%3A+more+gap-year+spirit+than+Glastonbury+hedonism&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgdy%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t50.2886-16/11803666_740000946146425_1121758894_n.mp4", "http://szigetfestival.com/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Sziget%3A+more+gap-year+spirit+than+Glastonbury+hedonism&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fmusic%2F2015%2Faug%2F17%2Fsziget-festival-hungary-gap-year-spirit-than-glastonbury-hedonism&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F15%2F1439674404335%2F9cac92c7-c2fd-4cc3-8f03-688bc99599cf-2060x1373.jpeg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZjAantupsA", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgdy%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://instagram.com/p/6ZpIAxrt6s/?taken-by=harrietgibsone", "http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-08-17/lifestyle/9408160308_1_rock-festival-woodstock-budapest", "http://eu.festivalawards.com/", "http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t50.2886-16/11797207_154049464929990_1860494499_n.mp4"], "published": "2015-08-18T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T21:37:56.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
