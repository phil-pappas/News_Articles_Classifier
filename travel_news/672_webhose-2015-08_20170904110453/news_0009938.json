Here's to the start of a million more DIY dreams, and a new generation of enthusiasts like Darrell Peters .\"\nJumpstart Gallery Story: 50 Years of Hot Rodding\nThe Jumpstart Gallery was ignited by a story from retired firefighter Darrell Peters for whom building and collecting project vehicles has been a lifelong passion.One of his favorite builds was a 1932 Ford Phaeton, one of only 2500 made. Peters used the JC Whitney catalogs to rebuild a Chevy 350 engine -- with gaskets, pistons and rings sourced from JC Whitney -- for the Phaeton. On the front end he installed a disc brake conversion, rack and pinion steering, and a modern suspension. More JC Whitney boxes came with shocks, brake calipers, bushings and tie rods. Forty-two years later, the Phaeton has a cushy life of car shows and occasional wedding/special event appearance.
