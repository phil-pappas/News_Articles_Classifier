Other 'risky' activities on the list may not be so obvious, such as amateur football referees and playing badminton.\nIn a survey of 1,000 adults for Virgin Money Travel Insurance, British holidaymakers of all ages were shown to be getting more adventurous to compete with the exploits of their friends.\nExperts at Virgin Money Travel insurance refer to this trend of travellers attempting to outdo each other as 'keeping up with the Indiana Joneses'\nIt found 63 per cent of 18-25-year-olds will choose to take part in such activities while away, perhaps spurred by what they've seen friends post of social media.\nBut one in five of the over-65s also claims to be more adventurous now than they were ten years ago.\nAnd although they may not be running from boulders or battling Nazis, a growing number of the over-65s do follow some of the exploits of Indiana Jones, the survey found.\nThis includes 51 per cent visiting ancient temples, 20 per cent crossing a rope bridge, nine per cent handling snakes on holiday and two per cent gone on archaeological digs.\nMillions of travel insurance policies have had to be updated to keep up with the growing travel trend, and now include activities such as 'cave tubing' and sand boarding (pictured)\nVirgin Money director of banking Darrell Evans said: 'Indiana Jones remains a role-model to many holidaymakers in the UK.\n'We've designed our travel policies with intrepid adventurers in mind, although they're also suitable for people who like to relax on holiday rather than battle the forces of darkness while hunting for the Holy Grail.'\nThe moves by Virgin Money echo a growing trend across the travel insurance industry to persuade more people to take out policies when going abroad.\nRecent research by ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, found that around one in five people travel abroad without travel insurance.\nThis increases to over a third when it comes to the under-35s, with many believing that insurance is an unnecessary additional cost when planning a holiday.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1Ik1bAd"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T12:24:02.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
