She is a full-stack web developer at the financial news business, Mergermarket. Designing an app in her spare time inspired her to look into a career in coding , and she signed up for a 12-week Makers Academy “Bootcamp” in 2014. Have you always been interested in coding? I have always had a natural curiosity for why tech works the way it does, and was often found playing with HTML and customising my PC or Mac. When the internet kicked in, my interest in coding was piqued by web pages, animations, real-time apps – that sort of thing. However, as a full-time, stay-at-home mother with a seven-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son, it wasn’t something I thought of as a career option. What turned you towards a short course? Before becoming a mother I worked in various customer-facing fields, most recently running a well-known weight-loss franchise. I really enjoyed it, but sold the franchise to focus on being a mum. When I became a single parent, though, I wanted to be a good example to my children and get back into a career. After four years out of work, I decided to become an occupational therapist. The coaches gave the right amount of instruction and hand-holding, while giving us the space to figure things out on our own My brilliant mother looked after the children while I studied, and at the same time, I began developing a web app that I hoped might provide a passive income that I could perhaps eventually rely on. I was surprised how much I enjoyed building the app – far more than my studies – but I soon realised that if I wanted to earn a living I needed to learn how to code properly, and ideally without beginning another degree. How difficult was it to get onto the course? The first bootcamps that I found out about were in the US, but I eventually discovered one at Makers Academy in Shoreditch, which was only a train ride away. I spoke to my mum and she agreed that if I got accepted onto the course she would help me with the children for the three-month study period. I was invited to interview for a place on a 12-week bootcamp in the summer. When I was accepted onto the course, which is registered with the Skills Funding Agency, I found that I could apply for a Professional and Career Development Loan to help cover the cost. Only when that was approved did I get that buzz that I was going to be a developer. Was the course what you expected? Joining the course was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. But when I attended the graduation of a cohort the Friday before I was due to start, I was amazed and terrified. Their work was outstanding and all I could think was, “Will I be able to do that in 12 weeks?” The course started well, with a great bunch of people from various backgrounds, but we worked hard and I found the pace stressful. I had two official meltdowns. Fortunately, the staff were superb and reassured me that I was exactly where I needed to be, and that most people go through the same feelings. Makers Academy has relationships with a range of employers and they promised to find us work at the end of the course The coaches gave the right amount of instruction and hand-holding, while giving us the space to figure things out on our own. Being a developer is about problem-solving and constant learning. You’re always re-evaluating what you think you know, so dealing with that is important. Our final project – a social networking app for freelancers called Fhellow – was awesome and was a real-world project with a relatively large team. The course is really good at helping you work as you would in a business setting, so that we were all comfortable with peer programming and collaborating on problems. Was it hard to find a job after graduation? Makers Academy has relationships with a range of employers, and throughout the course the coaches explained that all we needed to do was focus on learning – they promised to find us work at the end of it. Of course, I still worried about that. After graduation, I was put forward for several interviews and completed numerous technical tests. Eventually I found a job as a full-stack web developer at Mergermarket. I was always nervous about coding and typing in front of people, but eventually I became comfortable with the process. I’m now working on an iOS and Android app for Mergermarket. What I learned completely matches the work I’m doing and there are others in my team who completed the same course I did. Eventually I’d like to freelance, or even have an agency, but right now I’m just keen to develop my skills and carry on working with my great team. • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:46:14.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
