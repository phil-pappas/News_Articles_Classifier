Released on 15th August 1975 will be completing 40 years this week. It was panned by critics and dismissed by the public when it released. Quote: The Illustrated Weekly of India (now defunct), a sister publication of The Times of India, said in the August 31, 1975 issue: \"There is nothing in the script of Salim-Javed to make this 'the greatest story ever told,' it is just another dacoit tale on the lines of Mujhe Jeene Do, Gunga Jumna, Mera Gaon Mera Desh... The stereophonic sound and other technical innovations redeem Sholay from the shallows. Ramesh Sippy has introduced a feeling of verve and some of the action is gripping. But no sooner you are out of the theatre, it is gone: you realize that a story built on negative emotions like hatred and violence can have no lasting impression on the mind... Where the film fails is in its music — there is not one song that can be singled out as a noteworthy composition.\" Source: Quote: Sunday Standard, incorporating the Sunday Indian Express, too was underwhelmed. In its review headlined, \"Yet another dacoit film with Hollywood touch\", the film critic wrote in its Delhi edition: \"In their desperate search for new material, the manufacturers of Bombay's dacoit series have by now scraped everything of the barrel. And so what Salim-Javed sit down to do is the painstaking job of reassembling the parts, strictly to suit the individual talents of the 'greatest star cast ever assembled' all of which (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Bad Day at Black Rock, Bonnie and Clyde, Secret of Santa Vittoria, etc) add up to a shaggy dog Western, sporadically funny, ludicrously heroic, monstrously violent and sprawled in loose limbed abandon.\" Source: Theaters were to stop screening the movie after a week since the turnout was bleak. However word of mouth spread and people started coming to watch the movie. It ran for over 5 years (286 weeks) at Minerva in Bombay. The first movie to do so. Quote: But after a lukewarm first week, collections miraculously picked up on the second Sunday and kept growing. Ten weeks after its release, India’s first 70-mm film in stereophonic sound was declared a blockbuster, playing in 102 theatres. It remained unchallenged for 70-75 weeks in three theatres, celebrated a golden jubilee in 60 and a silver jubilees in over a 100 cinemas. In Calcutta’s Jyoti cinema it ruled for 103 weeks and in Minerva it ran uninterrupted for 286 weeks till December 10, 1980. It is said that for the first 75 weeks the current booking counter in Minerva didn’t open. Then, as the craze abated, between 1978 and 1980, it was screened only in matinee shows. Source If I am not mistaken this was the first movie where audio cassettes of the dialogues were sold and also outsold the audio cassettes of the songs. Gabbar's \"Kitne aadmi the\", \"Ab tera kya hoga Kaalia\" are still well remembered. The only time a character with only one dialogue in the entire movie is still remembered, Samba (Macmohan) All characters in the movie are still remembered even those who appeared for a couple of scenes like Soorma Bhopali", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:13:46.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
