While it includes group admissions, each visitor is limited to four tickets, she said.\nGeneral admission covers everything but \"Beyond All Boundaries,\" the multimedia spectacle about the war that Tom Hanks produced, and a simulated submarine ride aboard the U.S.S. Tang. Each of those attractions will cost $5 extra, she said.\nThe museum at 945 Magazine St. is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., including Labor Day.\nWith a general-admission ticket, visitors can see exhibits such as \"Fighting for the Right to Fight,\" which shows what African-Americans faced during World War II, and \"Road to Berlin: European Theater Galleries,\" which uses photos, videos and artifacts to trace developments in the European Theater.\nThe museum, which was opened in June 2000, is one of New Orleans' most popular attractions. According to museum figures, it attracted 515,000 visitors last year, 14 percent more than it drew in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T15:58:04.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
