Johnson and her husband, Tremayne Johnson. “Thank you Officer Jimmy Allen,” she wrote.\nKIRO 7 contacted the woman, Amby M. Johnson, through Facebook to ask about the traffic stop and to hear more about the story that happened in Silverdale, Washington, about two hours from Seattle.\nJohnson said she was shocked at how fast the story went viral and said Allen deserves all the kind praise.\n“Today you don't hear about the officers who actually do good, but I wanted to be one of the people to give credit when it's due,” Johnson wrote.\nHere is what Johnson wrote about how the moment came about. We have reached out to Allen as well and may update this story.\nI got pulled over today on Kitsap Bangor base in Silverdale, Washington. I was having a really bad contraction and I decided to go around the speed bump to avoid any further pain.\nThat's when I saw the lights.\nIt was a female Navy MP. I knew I was in the wrong, so I had no problem pulling over to get the consequence.\nShe told me why I was pulled over and was very nice about it. She asked for all the paperwork for a normal pull over and I gave her my license, registration and insurance. She informed me my plates were expired and I reached to my back seat and showed her that I had the new ones, my husband just had not had the time to put them on. He's in the Navy and sometimes he works long days and I don't wanna bother him to put them on.\nI'm 38 1/2 weeks pregnant and I still go to work as a caregiver. So my back is already worn out from being pregnant and assisting clients with bathing and transfers also take a toll on me. Bending over to put them on myself was definitely out of the question.\nA few moments later that's when another car pulled up, but this man had a uniform on that said police. I for sure thought I was gonna get a few tickets then, lol.\nThe MP gave me back my things and told me to make sure my husband put the new plates on. I asked if she thought the officer would mind.\nHe was so polite and said yes he just had to make sure he had the right tools. He changed the plates for me and the MP made a statement saying \"Officer of the year.\" I thought to myself like I should have her take a picture and post this on Facebook.\nToday you don't hear about the officers who actually do good, but I wanted to be one of the people to give credit when it's due.\nIt went viral so fast and I was so shocked. He deserves it. I just wish people who comment and share the story would stop seeing race or the fact that I said he was sweating his balls off.\nIt bothers me so bad that majority of the shares have the heading WHITE OFFICER helps BLACK WOMAN.\nI'm half white and half black. It's so sickening to read the comments from people sharing and they make comments like \"and then he shot her.\"\nJust see the story for what it is. A good officer helping out a woman. No race.\nLIKE KIRO 7 Eyewitness News on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/31/93/3e/Amby_Johnson_and_her_husband_Tremayne_Johnson-.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/KIRO7Seattle", "http://www.kirotv.com/photo/news/officer-jim-allen/pCmPR9/"], "published": "2015-08-01T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T12:31:25.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
