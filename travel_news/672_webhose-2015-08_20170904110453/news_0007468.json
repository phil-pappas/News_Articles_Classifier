There are strong business synergies between these cities for industries including fashion, diamond, automotive and chemicals. We are confident this new route will also be attractive to people looking for a city break and can be used as a gateway to Bruges, Ghent and Brussels, all accessible in under an hour from Antwerp.”\nWilliam Pearson, Aviation Development Director of Birmingham Airport, commented: “This new scheduled service linking Birmingham Airport to Antwerp is a welcome addition to the existing VLM route linking us to Waterford in Southeast Ireland. We expect this service to be popular with business travellers, given the airport’s proximity to the city centre, fast check-in service, and parking options, as well as leisure travellers. Both cities are hubs for tourists activities, with excellent connections to onward destinations.”\nPaul Faulkner, Chief Executive of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, says: “This new route to Antwerp is great news for our region, as not only does it suit many businesses in the area and locals wanting to visit this beautiful city, but it is another step towards cementing Birmingham’s future as a vibrant, global city.”\nVLM Airlines now offers scheduled services to seven destinations in five countries, including Geneva, Hamburg, Southampton, Waterford and London Luton.\nSource:- Birmingham Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:30:50.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
