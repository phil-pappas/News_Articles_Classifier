Hong Kong yesterday. This is the fourth consecutive year that Hong Kong Airlines has received the recognition and garnered ‘Top 3 Best Deals Awards’ for the first time. Ms. Ming Chan, General Manager of Corporate Communications, Hong Kong Airlines attended the ceremony and received the award on behalf of the Company.\nOver the past 13 years, Yahoo! Emotive Brand Awards has always been keen to recognize netizens’ favorite brands. Awarded brands were selected by netizens through 2-month online voting. The top three outstanding brands with highest votes in each category will be named as “Yahoo Emotive Brands”, making the results highly representative and credible. “Top 3 Best Deals Awards” recognizes companies with excellent performance in online promotion and publicity.\nMs. Ming Chan, General Manager of Corporate Communications, Hong Kong Airlines said, “As the fastest growing airline in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Airlines strives to provide a ‘fresh’ and ‘localized’ flying experience to our passengers. We are happy to partner with Yahoo which shares the same insights with us and grow together. We are honored to be named for the first time as one of the ‘Top 3 Best Deals Awards’ and yet another year as the ‘Top Emotive Brand’ in the Airline category. Over the years, Yahoo has helped extend the brand’s touch points through e-commerce, for example, a record-high flash deals in which a total of 1000 tickets sold in just 5 minutes definitely re-imagined the potential of e-commerce for us.”\nMing continued that Yahoo has also helped Hong Kong Airlines expand other online channels to reach the company’s target audiences and increase customer engagement. Hong Kong Airlines looks forward to cooperating closely with Yahoo to further develop and expand online business opportunities.\nSource:-Hong Kong Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:05:41.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
