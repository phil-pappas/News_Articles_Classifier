It’s the best place to pick up l’âme de Bordeaux, the special atmosphere of the city. There’s a brasserie [recently renamed Le Bordeaux] which does a good buffet breakfast – and Gordon Ramsay will shortly take over Le Pressoir d’Argent, its fine-dining restaurant. The hotel looks out on the Place de la Comédie and you can sit outside when it’s sunny. I might have a coffee and a croissant or just a little cannelé pastry. In Bordeaux there’s an English legacy – so brunch might be eggs, omelette or a savoury pancake. Sweet treats at the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux Then, on the Garonne each Sunday morning, there’s the Marché des Quais right on the quayside. It’s a meeting place for all the Bordelais people. There’s a big farmers’ market with fruits, vegetables and other regional produce, but also furniture, books and crafts. It’s the place to go on a Sunday for oysters and a glass of white wine at 11am, or bread with cold meats, cheeses, seafood or foie gras. Grand Hotel de Bordeaux, 2-5 Place de la Comédie (0033 5 57 30 43 46; ghbordeaux.com ). Buffet breakfast €38/£27; Continental breakfast €21/£15; coffee and three pastries €10/£7. Marché des Quais, Quai des Chartrons. Oysters, wine and bread, €6-€8/£4-£6. Open Sun 7am-1pm for edibles, until 4pm furniture, books, crafts. ...lunch In the historic centre of Bordeaux is La Tupina, where the food is cooked in a huge fireplace. The chef is Jean Pierre Xiradakis; he’s Bordelais, but he has a Greek name. He does mostly meat – chicken, duck, goose, beef and lamb – but also lamprey, sturgeon and caviar d’Aquitaine. The lamb is served with unpeeled garlic and mogettes (white beans) with bacon. This chef occupies the whole street, because he has a little hotel, a produce shop and a bar. When a president visits – Sarkozy or Chirac, say – or Queen Elizabeth, they have lunch here. It’s an institution. Le Noailles is a typical Bordelais brasserie where the waiters are dressed in black and white. You can have oysters, or a dish called tricandilles – pig’s tripe, which is only ever cooked on the grill. It’s a really old speciality of Bordeaux, and Le Noailles is the best place to try it. For lunch with a view, La Corniche is a beautiful spot. It’s up on La Dune du Pilat (Europe’s highest dune) – a Thirties hunting lodge in the Basque style, redesigned by Philippe Starck. They serve all the produce of the Arcachon Basin, so oysters and fish. It’s very fashionable but you go there for the view, not the food. I’d just have an aperitif – seafood carpaccio, say, with a glass of wine or champagne. La Corniche serves all the produce of the Arcachon Basin, so oysters and fish La Tupina, 6 rue Porte de la Monnaie, Bordeaux (5 56 91 56 37; latupina.com/en ). Set lunch menu €18/£13 (starter, main, coffee and a merveille, a French doughnut); classic menu €74/£52 (three courses with three wines); or à la carte. Le Noailles, 2 Allées Tourny, Bordeaux (5 56 81 94 45; lenoailles.fr ). Six oysters with crépinette €17.50/£12; three courses €30-€85/£21-£60 without wine. La Corniche, 46 avenue Louis Gaume, Pyla-sur-Mer (5 56 22 72 11; lacoorniche-pyla.com ). Seafood platters €35-€80/£25-£56 (serves one); oysters and shellfish €14-€36/£10-£25 (crépinette €5/£3.50 extra); caviar €65/£46. …fine dining Apart from La Grande Maison, the only fine dining restaurant is in the north of Médoc – Château Cordeillan-Bages, set in the Château Lynch-Bages vineyards in Pauillac, between the Garonne and the Atlantic. As you might expect, there are 1,500 wines in the cellar, including all the Bordeaux Grands Crus. The chef is Jean-Luc Rocha and the place has two Michelin stars. Dishes might include warm foie gras in a cereal crust with port reduction and melon sorbet, king crab ravioli with Aquitaine caviar, and crispy suckling pig with piquillos (a type of chilli) and watermelon. Château Cordeillan-Bages, set in the Château Lynch-Bages vineyards in Pauillac About 60 miles south of Bordeaux is Les Prés d’Eugénie – Michel Guérard’s acclaimed restaurant, with three Michelin stars. It’s a beautiful place with wonderful, creative food: spider crab and grapefruit water Madras, with crunchy fritters of tangy sorrel leaves; silky blinis of black and white truffles; or beautiful scampi grilled on the embers with marsala duck consommé. There’s a more affordable menu, too, featuring home-made foie gras, truffles, ceps, white asparagus, pig’s trotter and smoked eel. Château Cordeillan-Bages, Route des Châteaux, Pauillac (5 56 59 24 24; jmcazes.com/en/chateau-cordeillan-bages ). Set lunch menu €60/£42 (three courses with wines); three-course “Inspiration” menu €90/£63, four courses €140/£99; tasting menu €175/£123 (10 courses). Les Prés d’Eugénie, Eugénie-les-Bains, Landes (5 58 05 06 07; michelguerard.com ). Individual dishes €49-€85/£35-£60; “Terroire Sublime” menu €130/£92 (three courses with wines); “Grande Carte” tasting menus €195/£137 (four courses), €235/£166 (five courses), both without wines. …an aperitif The place to go for a drink and a beautiful view in summer is the rooftop bar at the Grand Hotel de Bordeaux. Famous in the region is an aperitif called Lillet, which comprises white wine, sugar, sweet and sour oranges, and spices. It’s made by an old family from south of Bordeaux. Grand Hotel de Bordeaux (see above). Lillet rouge or blanc, €10-€12/£7-£9. …dinner There’s a little place in the old centre of Bordeaux, called Miles Restaurant, with four young chefs – one Korean, one Danish, one Indian, and one English. They do only one menu with six or seven dishes and it’s very original, world cuisine with different influences: smoked fish with Indian flavours, for example. The restaurant itself is modern and well designed. Miles Restaurant, 33 rue du Cancera, Bordeaux (5 56 81 18 24; en.restaurantmiles.com ). Dinner tasting menu €43/£30 (five courses). Also open for lunch – set menus €24/£17 (three courses) and €29/£20 (four courses).
