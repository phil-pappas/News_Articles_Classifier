The awards ceremony takes place at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) on September 8, 2015 during the PATA Travel Mart 2015.\nCox and Kings pioneered the concept `Grab Your Dream’ in order to establish Adventure Plus as a new category. The product Adventure Plus was launched with an online contest, where we used social media to draw in maximum number of entries. The contest reached out to around 8.5 million people overall using different social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and an interactive website. A total of 12,000 entries were shortlisted for the contest. The winners were thereafter sent on an all-expense paid holiday.\nCommenting on the achievement, Mr. Karan Anand, Head, Relationship, Cox and Kings said, “Receiving the award from an internationally acclaimed organisation like PATA is a great honour. It was for the first time in India that a travel company successfully engaged with contestants on an online platform and helped build the Grab Your Dream Brand.’’\n‘ Grab Your Dream’ built a content network connecting stories and conversations thus building the brand and engaging people around the web. Cox & Kings’ social channels hosted travel stories and blogs. Even snaps were updated on a real time basis by the 12 ambassadors selected as winners.\nThe contest is divided into 4 seasons and the objective of the contest is to look for 50 Travel Adventurers who can represent Cox & Kings and Ezeego1 as travel ambassadors. The ambassadors are chosen on the basis of their submissions, a personal interview and the number of votes they get on their submissions. 12 winners are picked per season and each of them gets the chance to travel on an all-expenses-paid holiday to some of the most exciting places on earth.\n“ Grab Your Dream has become an aspiration in itself for several young travellers. The enormous response that we have been receiving since its conception has built the foundation for several more travel adventures in the future and many more dreams to be grabbed”, concluded Mr. Anand.\nABOUT COX AND KINGS LTD: (BSE: 533144 | NSE: COX&KINGS)\nCox & Kings Ltd.
