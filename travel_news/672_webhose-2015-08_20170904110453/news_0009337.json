A flash of lightning is seen hitting the tail end of the Delta jet as it sits on the tarmac. \nThe incident happened so quickly that Perkins was not even aware he had captured the image until he watched the film later on, according to The Mirror . \nPerkins posted the video on YouTube, with the explanation: \"While filming the line of planes all stacked up during a ground hold in Atlanta on 8/18/15, I happened to capture this direct lightning strike on a 737.\" \nDelta spokesman Morgan Durrant confirmed to CNN that lightning struck Las Vegas-bound Delta Flight 67 on Tuesday, as the Boeing 737-900R aircraft was in the takeoff queue in Atlanta. \nThere were no reports of injuries among the 111 customers and six crew.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T02:01:33.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
