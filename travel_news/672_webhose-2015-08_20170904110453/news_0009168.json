Where great American cities are concerned, none shine brighter than the Big Apple. Spanning five boroughs that contain activities only limited by the imagination, New York is an eclectic, diverse city that is buzzing with energy. Don't be fooled into thinking the Big Apple is all Times Square tourist traps, Broadway shows and big-city cosmopolitan living, however.\nDare to venture off the tour guide's path, and you will discover that New York's boroughs and neighborhoods are littered with small-town charm, flair and distinct personalities. From the local pizzerias that have been around for generations to the local delis that have become institutions, there is always something in the city that will surprise, amaze and inspire you.\nCharleston\n© iStock/Getty Images Pineapple Fountain at Waterfront Park in Charleston, SC.

Southern California is one of the few places where it's possible to surf and snowboard all in the same day, making it an ideal locale for the avidly active.\nPlenty of professional sports teams abound, and fine dining is as available as the legendary In-N-Out fast food chain.

The architecture and authenticity is not to be outdone, either, with a beautiful amalgamation of its Native American, Spanish and American influences on full display.\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlRayS.img&description=Austin+-+Erich+Schlegel%2fReuters", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlRigd.img&description=Santa+Fe+-+ivanastar%2fGetty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlR5wx.img&description=Maremagnum%2fGetty+Images+-+iStock%2fGetty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fCCM9Z.img&description=Greetings-From-Austin-Mural+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlR5vU.img&description=New+York+-+Maremagnum%2fGetty+Images", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fCCMa4%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlRfGy.img&description=Los+Angeles+-+Christian+Kober%2fGetty+Images"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T08:25:54.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
