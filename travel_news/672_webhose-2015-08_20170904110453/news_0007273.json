And once again Green Globe congratulates The HCC on another year of certified green practices and for leading the meeting and event industry with a score of 96%. \nThe HCC’s key icon is its 100 year-old town hall with magnificent doomed ballroom, which is still regarded as one of the most beautiful ballrooms in Europe. This heritage piece of architecture is married to spacious function halls and 30 conference and seminar rooms. Overall, The HCC has 13,000 sqm of conference space with 15,000 seats. \nThe HCC Director, Joachim Konig said, “The very successful Green Globe re-certification of The HCC is confirmation of our intensive implementation of sustainability concepts throughout the whole business including gastronomy. \n“At HCC, sustainability is permanently installed in our management system, which accompanies collective entrepreneurial development and constantly develops new priorities and additional initiatives. \n“We especially focus on issues which may be considered marginal to the tasks of running a conference and event center. A good example is the Martin birdhouse we have created to provide safe nesting for Swallows. Additionally the installation of our own bee colonies and herb garden supports our organic gastronomy. These types of initiatives make us quite distinctive to other convention and event centers. \n“Again and again we find new challenges which may be small building blocks, but make a real difference. Recently we announced the launch of a pilot project designed together with the Municipal Utility Hannover and the Technical University of Berlin, to deliver a cold water supply system that requires less energy and therefore reduces CO2 emissions. Once again HCC demonstrates that sustainable practices, no matter how diverse can be updated and improved.” \nThe HCC is one of the most complete event and meeting destinations in Europe, sitting beside 60,000 square meters of parkland, allowing visitors and delegates the green space to relax in between events. The Congress Centrum is connected directly to the 4 star Congress Hotel am Stadtpark Hannover, with 258 rooms for quality accommodation. Completing the package is The HCC’s in-house event catering, which is responsible for hosting more than 400 events each year. \nAbout Green Globe Certification \nGreen Globe is the worldwide sustainability system based on internationally-accepted criteria for sustainable operation and management of travel and tourism businesses.
