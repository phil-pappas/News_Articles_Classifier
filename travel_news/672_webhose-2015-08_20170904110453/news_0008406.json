There's a mud road through the swamp with telegraph poles along the route. \nThe driveway leading to Edward Babcock’s house is nearly five kilometres long. \nThat gives you some idea of the size of his ranch outside Fort Myers in southwest Florida . It was 154,000 acres (62,321 hectares) when Babcock, a Pittsburgh lumber baron and former mayor, bought it in 1914 when southern Florida was mostly swamp and dense forests. And while around him, the sunshine state grew by millions of people, thousands of hotels, endless condos, luxury homes, amusement parks and marinas, Babcock kept his massive ranch looking much as it did 100 years ago. \nHe eventually donated 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares) to the state as a wildlife management area. Twenty years ago, Babcock’s heirs opened up the remaining 94,000 acres (38,040 hectares) at Punta Gorda to the public and Babcock Ranch became one of the most popular eco-tourism stops in Florida. The entire ranch was sold last year to a real estate development firm, but it’s not as bad as it sounds. \nThe developer then sold 74,000 acres (29,947 hectares) to the State of Florida for $350 million US to maintain in perpetuity as a wilderness preserve. So, you will still be able to roam through the swamps, forests and pastures of the ranch in a unique swamp bus looking at alligators, panthers, black bears, deer, exotic birds and real-life cowboys. \nOn the other 18,000 acres (7,284 hectares), developer, Syd Kitson, a former NFL lineman with the Green Bay Packers, plans to create the world’s most sustainable city with 19,600 homes. Kitson plans to have his community powered solely by solar power by having Florida Power & Light build the world’s largest photovoltaic power station. \nWhile riding through the Cypress swamp areas of Babcock Ranch, you will be able to rub the soft underbelly of an alligator and understand why their skin is held in such high regard by designers of high-end shoes and luggage. That gator gets right on the rugged, open-air bus with you. Thankfully, it’s only a baby (with sharp teeth), and is held firmly in the grip of guide Mike Winters. \nOther alligators, some nearly four metres long and with much bigger teeth, come within a metre of the bus passengers, but thankfully, they aren’t welcome aboard. They remain in the shallow swamp waters through which the bus rumbles. \nAnd although the elusive Florida panthers that prowl around the ranch at night are rarely seen, you’ll get to look one or two of them right in their deep green eyes. Two panthers live on the ranch in a large penned-in area. Others roam freely in the woods. \nOther species on the ranch also flourish, including Florida Cracker cattle, the oldest breed known in America. They look like Texas Longhorns, but they are smaller and their horns are not as wide, which is important. With wider horns, they would never have been able to survive their feral lives in the Florida swamps, for the horns would tangle in the dense foliage, according to guide and swamp bus diver Winters. \nReal-life cowboys wrangle the cattle on this huge ranch. And they look like the cowboys you remember from Saturday afternoon movies. They live on the ranch, some in bunkhouses, ride horses everywhere and have holsters on their hips, but Winters says the holsters are for their cell phones. Exposed guns are illegal in this county. \nPart of the ranch is called Telegraph Swamp. There’s a mud road through the swamp with telegraph poles along the route. Winters said the telegraph lines carried the message in 1898 that the U.S. battleship Maine had been blown up in Havana Harbour to spark the Spanish American War. \nThe state’s purchase of 74,000 acres (29,947 hectares) completes a publicly owned wildlife corridor of 400,000 acres (161,874 hectares) connecting Lake Okeechobee west to the Gulf of Mexico. \nThe swamp bus tour takes 90 minutes and costs $18 for adults and $11 for children three to 11 years old. On the tours, you might see bald eagles, black bears, bison, wild turkeys, wild pigs, burrowing owls, sandhill cranes, quails, fox squirrels, rattlesnakes and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. After the tour, you can visit the Babcock Ranch Museum, which depicts the natural and cultural history of southern Florida. The museum is in a small trapper’s shack and it might look familiar. It played a significant role in the Warner Bros. movie Just Cause with Sean Connery and Laurence Fishburne, which was filmed on the ranch in 1995. \nWinters said Connery is terrified of snakes and refused to enter a water-filled ditch for a scene until all the water was replaced with tap water. Guards with shotguns had to stand just out of camera view to blast anything that moved in the grass. So much for agent 007. \nOnly 50 kilometres south of Babcock Ranch you can visit another unique land development project. When Tom Monaghan sold his 93 per cent interest in Domino’s Pizza in 1998 for $1 billion, he used a chunk of that money to create Ave Maria University in Collier County just east of Bonita Springs . \nA spectacular oratory dominates the heart of the 1,000-student Catholic university and will serve as the principal landmark for the new community of Ave Marie, which Monaghan is building around the 5,000-acre university campus. \nIF YOU GO \nMore information about Babcock Ranch is available at www.babcockwilderness.com and information about Ave Maria is available at www.avemaria.com . © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T17:19:47.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
