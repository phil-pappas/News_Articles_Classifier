The fund aims to encourage businesses to develop new tourism experiences that will enhance overall visitor experience and satisfaction in Singapore. In conjunction with the launch of the new Fund, the Board is also calling for proposals for tour development and technology initiatives.\n“Increasingly, travellers are seeking varied and engaging experiences that allow them to gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of our stories and heritage. They’re not just going for run-of-the-mill city tours but unique ones like back-of-house visits, precinct or interest-based tours,” says Ms Choo Huei Miin, Director of Visitor Experience and Capability Development, STB. “Through the ESF, which is underpinned by STB’s Quality Tourism[1] strategy, we aim to spur tourism businesses to create and deliver more and better experiential offerings that add to Singapore’s overall destination attractiveness. Tourism businesses are also encouraged to adopt innovative technology solutions to up their game.”\nMs Susan Ang, Divisional Director, Island Investment and Branding, Sentosa Development Corporation, comments on how the ESF could benefit Singapore’s famous resort island: “Sentosa is constantly looking at ways to improve its operations, services and infrastructure, to enhance the experiences of our guests on the island. We believe that the introduction of this new scheme by STB will be helpful to our many partners on the island, as they would have the opportunity to tap on this funding to enhance their offerings and ultimately, create a more dynamic and memorable experience for all our visitors.”\nRobinsons is considering tapping on the new Fund to bring a new dimension to shoppers’ experience.\n“Robinsons is a longstanding, home-grown department store with over 150 years of history in Singapore. We would like to share our rich brand heritage and story with our shoppers by establishing a Robinsons heritage gallery at our flagship store at The Heeren. STB’s new Experience Step-Up Fund will be helpful for retailers or malls intending to embark on such initiatives as they will enrich our consumers’ shopping experience while building stronger brand affinity with them,” expresses Christophe Cann, Group Managing Director, Robinsons.\nCall for Proposals for Tour Development and Technology Initiatives\nSingapore Registered Businesses can submit their proposals for tour development and technology initiatives from now till 5 February 2016. STB will hold bi-monthly evaluation cycles in October 2015, December 2015 and February 2016. Applications are to reach STB by the 5th of the month of the evaluation cycle.
