Three clinics are to open in the Seattle region and three in the Portland area early next year.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid Providence said in a statement that the partnership will seek to link the often temporary care provided by these clinics with other parts of its health-care organization. Health records from the Providence and Swedish systems will connect to the clinics, leading to better coordination of information and better care, the organization said.\nThe clinics will run on extended hours all days of the week. The first three stores in the Seattle area — in Kirkland, Renton and Issaquah — will be staffed by Swedish practitioners. Providence staffers will operate stores in Vancouver, Wash., and in Beaverton and Milwaukie, Ore.\nProvidence and Walgreens said that their partnership will explore opportunities of further collaboration across the Deerfield, Ill.-based retailer’s national footprint.\nThe deal follows a similar move by local pharmacy chain Bartell Drugs, which in 2013 joined forces with Group Health to provide walk-in clinics at its stores. The clinics, dubbed CareClinics, are at Bartells in North Seattle, Ballard and Bellevue.\nRite Aid, the Camp Hill, Pa.-based pharmacy chain, in May announced that its retail clinic unit and MultiCare Health System, a regional nonprofit health provider, would join forces to open 11 clinics in Seattle-area Rite Aid pharmacies.\nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .
