We produce the group tours brochure each year and only when we feel we’ve got quality to add do we produce a [tailor-made] brochure. \n“We don’t publish brochures every year, preferring instead to create something really special, compiled by professional travel writers and our own destination experts, that our clients will want to keep over time. \n“It’s more like a richly illustrated guide book; a comprehensive tool that will help our clients to plan their dream trip.” \nThe programme covers Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia and also has a focus on available experiences for the first time. \nSingh said: “Our clients want to engage in doing things rather than just going out and seeing a place.” \nPrices lead in at £1,390 for the 10-day Classic Cambodia trip, which includes return flights, seven nights’ B&B accommodation and all internal entry fees and transportation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:01:14.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
