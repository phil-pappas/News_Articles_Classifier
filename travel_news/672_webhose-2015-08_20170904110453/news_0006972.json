[tweet_Quote: display=\"New Consumer Price Index data - air fare prices declined 5.6 percent in July vs. June - biggest m/m drop in 20 years.\"]New Consumer Price Index data this week shows that fare prices declined 5.6 percent in July vs. June, the biggest month-to-month price drop in 20 years.[/tweet_Quote: ] And investors are running away from airline stocks as if owning them is the best way to become infected with the Ebola virus.Yet the Justice Department is conducting not one, but two antitrust investigations in possible airline anticompetitive behavior.One can only conclude that if two or more airlines were colluding, or engaging in illegal price gouging, the worrisome declines in their unit revenues and share prices this summer stand as indictments of their utter incompetence at cheating.More likely, at least one, and perhaps both of the Justice Department investigations can be put down to the ponderously slow bureaucracy just now getting around to looking at the 15 percent run-up in the average fare price over the previous couple of years. And perhaps part of it can be laid at the feet of government “experts” whose understanding of the economic and business factors involved in the airline business is anything but expert.It is true that U.S. airlines have been reporting record profits over the last 18 months. Their numbers sound – and are - really, really big. American Airlines’ parent, for example, earned a whopping $1.7 billion in the quarter ended June 30. Delta earned $1 billion; United $1.2 billion; Southwest $608 million. Each was an all-time record. By any historical measurement, those are all jaw-dropping profits for companies – with the exception of consistently profitable 43-year-old Southwest – whose cumulative losses over their 80-plus years of existence still far exceed their cumulative profits.But what’s not widely understood – by either the public or, apparently, the Justice Department’s competition referees – is that those profits actually have relatively little to do with the prices the airlines have been charging. To be sure, fares did rise significantly over the previous three years. But they remain a relative bargain to most other services and goods, whose prices, for the most part, have risen more. And neither those fares, nor the revenue from the many fees the airlines have imposed on customers in recent years come close to explaining the airlines’ new-found and impressive profits.In 2009 the average domestic fare price reached its inflation-adjusted nadir of $343. Last year’s average fare paid was 14 percent higher; $391. But that’s still far short of the average $454 consumers paid for a domestic ticket in 1995 on an inflation-adjusted basis – even if you assume the average passenger these days pays $25 in additional fees on top of his or her fare.What’s more, even before the Justice Department informed the big carriers earlier this summer that it is looking into possible collusion among them, the average fare price had begun falling. The big carriers have been reporting small declines in both overall revenues and average revenue per passenger mile flown all year. Some of that’s the result of softening travel demand both in Europe and, especially, Asia. But there’s evidence that domestic travelers have been pushing back against airlines’ efforts to push domestic fare prices higher, or even to maintain them at existing levels. Domestic air travel demand is growing very slowly. And more travelers are trading down to less expensive/more restrictive tickets, switching to lower cost/lower fare niche carriers, or taking one or two trips fewer.That’s the market at work; consumers exercising their economic decision-making power in reaction to merchants’ efforts to push prices higher. As a result, merchants’ unit revenues flatten out or decline.That is why this is a summer of extraordinary irony for most airlines. They’re reporting unprecedented profits but are being bedeviled by declining unit revenues and stock prices. Yet the government thinks they must be colluding.If we assume that the legal eagles at the Justice Department have no smoking gun evidence of collusion – a safe assumption because if they did they already would have tried for huge headlines by disclosing it publicly – we can only conclude that they have overlooked the two really, really big factors driving the airlines’ record profits:\nMore than $10 billion worth of combined annual cost savings since 2001 . Those were achieved through a combination bankruptcies, mergers, restructurings, near-bankruptcies, operational cost-cutting, debt re-financings, layoffs, forced early retirements, outsourcings, revised labor contracts and general penny-pinching. And nearly all of those steps imposed extraordinary pain on hundreds of thousands of employees and even more shareholders. All that – not collusion on prices - explains how U.S. airlines could earn $6 billion in 2000 while paying 80 cents a gallon for jet fuel yet earned over 50 percent more - $9.7 billion – in 2013 while paying a stunning $3.03 a gallon. t A nearly 60 percent drop in the price of jet fuel since last summer. Without a $1 billion favorable swing in jet fuel prices, American’s $1.7 billion second quarter profit this year would have been only about half as large. It also likely would not have been able to buy back $1 billion worth of its shares from investors this year, or to resume paying a quarterly dividend (10 cents a share) for the first time in more than 25 years. And though the dollar figures are different, big fuel cost savings were key in producing similar windfall-like results at Delta, United and Southwest. If the big U.S. carriers did talk to one another either about actual fare prices or ways to limit the growth of capacity on key routes, then they deserve to be hammered hard by the Justice Department, not only for their illegal and unethical behavior but for their sheer stupidity, too.And if the Justice Department can prove from their second investigation that certain airlines engaged in price gouging on the East Coast after a fatal Amtrak crash in May near Philadelphia disrupted Amtrak operations across the region for a week, then those carriers deserve severe punishment for the same reasons. But that accusation is, if anything, even more far-fetched than the notion of price/capacity collusion.The Washington-New York-Boston corridor air shuttle routes are among the most heavily traveled and highest-priced in the nation on a day-in, day-out basis. Thus, it’s very unlikely that there ever were lots of cheap, unsold airline seats in the East Coast air shuttle flights for the thousands of displaced Amtrak passengers to buy. [tweet_Quote: display=\"Airlines didn’t have to raise fares after the train crash to gouge Amtrak passengers; they were already that high.\"]The airlines didn’t have to raise their prices to upset displaced Amtrak passengers; their fares were already that high before the train crash. That’s why so many of those displaced Amtrak passengers were taking the train in the first place.[/tweet_Quote: ] Now, as summer moves toward its conclusion, and airlines move into the historically weak fall travel season, it will be interesting to see if their unit revenues continue to lag and whether investors will continue to disdain their shares. It’ll also be interesting to see whether – and how - the Justice Department will bring their investigations to formal, public conclusions? Or, will Justice just let these ironic and improbable investigations quietly fade away?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:12:00.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
