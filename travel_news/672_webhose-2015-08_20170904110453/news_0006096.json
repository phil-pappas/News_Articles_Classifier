The development — themed after the lifestyle of musician Jimmy Buffett and his song “Margaritaville” — is being built on 305-plus acres owned by Rolling Oaks Splendid LLC near the intersection of U.S. Highway 192 and Black Lake Road. Here, developer Jim Bagley , managing director of Encore Capital Management , tells what to expect and how soon businesses can get involved: How did this come together? We have been working with Margaritaville Holdings for 15 to 16 months. We wanted to create an immersive casual theme experience in a residential community setting. When we looked for brands that epitomized this casual lifestyle, Margaritaville stood out as the best. What will MargaritaVillage include? Almost 1,000 vacation rental homes, 300 condos, 300-plus timeshares, a water park, 170,000 square feet of space for retail and themed restaurants, and a hotel with 180-300 rooms What tenants are you seeking for the retail space? Iconic retail options never before seen in Orlando. As for the restaurants, we want similar iconic options from other countries seeking a U.S. flagship location. What activities will be offered? We will have the “Son of a Sailor” fishing school, plus paddle boarding and kayaking that will promote the eco-conscious lifestyle of Margaritaville. There also will be a FinCity arcade and St. Somewhere Spa, planetarium. What’s the construction timeline? We’re going through county approvals right now and expect to be done with that in six months. Site clearing should begin in early 2016 with vertical construction in third-quarter 2016, with another six to nine months to complete. How many jobs will you create? About 500-800 construction jobs and 700 permanent jobs after construction. All the components are coming out of the ground at the same time. Will you use local vendors? We will use a broad vendor base from Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville. We’re hiring right now because we’re more advanced on this project than people think.
