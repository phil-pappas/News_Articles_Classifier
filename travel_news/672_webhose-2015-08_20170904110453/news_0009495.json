But I don't like to deviate too far from the original because once you start adding too much, you take away the plainness of a mac and cheese in white sauce,\" says Aikens. \"I like to keep it as simple and true as possible.\" During a recent visit to his Hong Kong restaurant The Pawn , Aikens shared his own recipe for mac and cheese with CNN. With just a few simple gourmet twists, it instantly revitalizes the family classic. Full recipe below. To see Aikens whip up the dish himself, check out the video above.
