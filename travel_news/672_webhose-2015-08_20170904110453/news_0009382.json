But, what about turquoise waters and white sand? In Anguilla, CuisinArt Golf Resort Spa is a destination. Founded by the same owner, billionaire Leandro Rizzuto, the hotel is a perfect place for foodies. \nFor starters, it’s the only resort in Anguilla with its own hydroponic farm. What’s that you ask? Picture a greenhouse that grows much of the produce on waterbeds. The restaurants’ menus use a majority of the organic fruits, vegetables, edible flowers and herbs that are grown here. Naturally (pun intended), the menus of the five restaurants reflect what’s in season and offer a real farm-to-table dining experience. Also, guests can enjoy a complimentary tour of the farm. It feels like an adult field trip (though you don’t have to go far since it’s on the property). \nAmong the five restaurants at the resort is Tokyo Bay, Anguilla’s only Japanese restaurant. Non-hotel guests come here all the time. Led by new chef Joe Richardson — who learned his craft at Le Cordon Bleu — Tokyo Bay offers a re-imagined menu. Think of it as sushi with a twist. Standouts include tuna with cherry soy reduction topped with foie gras, crispy Brussels sprouts with spicy yakitori sauce, and local snapper with Ponzu gelée and cucumber strings. Not so much as one grain of rice is out of place. \nAlso find AAA Four Diamond restaurant, Le Bistro at Santorini. Executive chef Jasper Schneider — formerly the corporate chef at Artisanal Food Group and chef de cuisine for Azur by le Bernardin — is the man behind the menu. Some of his best dishes include local crayfish with cream lemon cilantro and orange powder Jasmine rice, as well as pan roasted snapper with a cauliflower puree ragout of Marcona almonds and currants. \nChef Schneider also offers guests what’s called The Chef’s Table Food and Wine Experience. Located in the private dining room of Le Bistro, guests take pleasure in an eight-course menu of his choosing. Each dish is paired with a wine from the resort’s extensive wine cellar (4,000 bottles to choose from). And, to finish it off, pastry chef Colin Yearwood creates a masterpiece of his own. On the night of our tasting, he prepared an all-white parfait concocted of lemon grass gel, coconut meringue and bush tea soda. \nGuests can also arrange for a private dinner at their villa or on the beach. Also prepared by chef Schneider and his team, the choices include Caribbean classics like barbecued lobster, whole Snapper and corn on the cob with jerk butter. A real feast! \nIf you’re inspired by all of the delicious meals, you can opt to take a cooking class. Chef Schneider shares recipes of dishes right off the menu and walks guests through the preparation step-by-step. The best part? You’ll get to enjoy the fruits of your labor. \nExplore the gallery above to escape to the Caribbean’s coolest stay for foodies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T21:36:16.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
