(Keurig has sought to stem the tide by introducing a new machine that only worked with licensed K-cups, but it proved to be so unpopular that it later had to launch an add-on that let users brew whatever they wanted.)\nEven partners like Starbucks, which has a multiyear agreement with Keurig, are encroaching on its territory.\nIn a four-week period ending mid-July, Keurig saw its share of coffee-pod sales drop to 27 percent from nearly a third a year before. Meanwhile, according to figures by Wells Fargo analysts who closely track the coffee-pod niche, the Seattle coffee giant’s market share grew by about 1 percent. Since it’s a rapidly growing market, remaining steady in terms of market share meant Starbucks’ pod sales actually grew 28 percent.\n Boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert at CenturyLink Starbucks executives say that K-cups are a “primary driver” of sales growth in its Channel Development segment, which last quarter saw an 8 percent bump in revenue to $404 million.\nIt sells “Cinnamon Dolce” and “Mocha” K-cups as well as an iced-coffee K-cup, and will soon launch a “hot cocoa” version.\n“Our portfolio continues to increase its share of the K-Cup category despite competitive pricing pressure from new and existing market participants,” said Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw in a July earnings call.\n— Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com\nRedhook owner’s outlook: flat Speaking of beverage companies falling short and getting punished by the market … how are things going at Craft Brew Alliance, whose brands include the local Redhook?\nCraft Brew’s shares fell nearly 19 percent Thursday and ended the week at nearly a two-year low. That was after the company said shipments for the year would be virtually flat (never a good thing in beer), increasing just 1 to 3 percent instead of the 6 to 8 percent forecast earlier.\nThe Oregon-based brewer laid much of the blame for its lackluster quarterly results on its Redhook brand, describing it once again as “the least profitable brand in the portfolio.”\nRedhook sales are down 12 percent year to date. And while Craft Brew has been dialing back distribution of its beers to focus on the strongest markets close to each brand’s region of origin, it said the rate of decline caught executives by surprise.\nIt’s not just a Redhook problem, said Craft Brew executives, who also oversee the Widmer Brothers and Kona regional brands.\n“We continue to see an acceleration in new entrants across multiple geographies and channels, adding an unprecedented level of competition in virtually every corner of the beer market,” CEO Andrew Thomas told analysts on a conference call Thursday.\nOn the upside, Craft Brew said its brands are holding their own in their home markets.\n“Redhook grew in Washington, Widmer Brothers grew in Oregon, and Kona continues to grow in Hawaii,” Thomas said.\nThat’s why the company aims to focus its marketing on each of those home markets. It also is working on more local partnering deals like the one it inked with Appalachian Mountain Brewery of North Carolina.\nWhile California was a big problem area for Craft Brew last quarter, in Washington state Redhook’s renewed focus seemingly paid off. Sales of its Longhammer IPA grew 17 percent, for instance.\n— Rami Grunbaum: rgrunbaum@seattletimes.com\nGates has onion farm, onion trouble Maybe Bill Gates should be investing in Walla Walla onions. The famous Vidalia onions have gotten him some bad press down South, where a Gates investment vehicle owns an onion farm in Georgia, Bloomberg News reports.\nThe farm is on probation in Georgia after neighboring farmers accused it of substituting garden-variety bulbs for renowned Vidalias, the Bordeaux grapes of the onion world.\nThe farm was disciplined in June for a lesser violation and paid no fine, although it lost onions valued at more than $100,000 when they rotted during the probe, according to state estimates.\n“We felt that spoilage that took place was discipline enough,” Gary Black, Georgia’s commissioner of agriculture, told Bloomberg. If it errs again, the farm could forfeit its license.\nCompanies using the address of Gates’ private investment firm, Cascade Investment in Kirkland, began buying hundreds of acres in Georgia and Florida about three years ago.\nBloomberg reports the Stanley Vidalia operation was bought last year for about $10 million. Cascade Investment didn’t return phone calls.\nBy federal law, the squat, sweet-flavored Vidalia onion can be grown and packaged in only one region in Georgia.\nThey “are not just the most famous onions in the world: I think they may be the only famous onions in the world,” wrote star chef Bobby Flay in his “Bobby Flay Cooks American” cookbook.\nVidalia farmers, many with corporate pedigrees and most with international experience, have parlayed their onions into a $100 million to $168 million annual market.\n“Don’t think for a second that this is ‘Hee-Haw’ days,” said Chip Carter, a writer for trade publication Produce News, referring to the TV-variety show that depicted dimwitted, straw-chewing farmers.\nThe events leading to the Gates farm’s probation began in April, when locals noticed it was getting onions to market faster than better-equipped competitors, including organic Vidalias that had failed everywhere else.\nThen they spotted a truck carrying yellow onions from outside of Vidalia territory entering the region at the height of the Vidalia season.\nThe onions were from Florida, including from one of Gates’ earlier farm acquisitions. The interloping vegetables were unloaded at Stanley’s packing house.\nCompetitors staked out the route, taking videos and iPhone pictures. The result was an ad hoc night meeting among Black and more than 30 Vidalia farmers who accused Stanley Farms of shipping Florida yellow onions as Vidalias.\n“It was an anomaly, and they observed it,” said Black, the commissioner. “It’s a very small group of people down there.”\nThe state found organic yellow onions inside Stanley’s packing facility that weren’t properly segregated from Vidalias as required by law.\nBut after reviewing hundreds of shipping documents, it found no evidence that the lesser bulbs had been shipped as Vidalias.\n“There are two things you cannot do,” Black said. “You cannot pack a yellow onion in a Vidalia onion bag. And you cannot have non-Vidalia yellow onions in the packing facility when Vidalia onions are present.”\nSince the disciplinary action in June, things have quieted in the Vidalia fields. Vigilance will continue, as it always does, said Jason Herndon, chairman of an onion-advisory committee.\n“If we let issues fall through the cracks,” he said, “the Vidalia onion will be just another sweet onion.”\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:29:23.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
