Nick Trend, Telegraph Travel's consumer editor, said: “Eurostar’s cheapest tickets sell out well in advance - especially to Paris. These fares - which offer even better value - are likely to go even more quickly. The fare to Lyon, which now has regular direct services from London, looks particularly attractive.” • Eurostar to launch direct service to Amsterdam • Flight, ferry or train - which is the best way to get to France? • Eurostar at 20: two decades of the cross-channel operator Avignon Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Paris needs no introduction, being one of the most beautiful and cultured cities in the world – and a favourite with British travellers.
