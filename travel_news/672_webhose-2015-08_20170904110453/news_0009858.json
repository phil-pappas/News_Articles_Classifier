The MH370 incident had somewhat decreased Chinese arrival in Malaysia. Chinese arrivals had seen a decline of 27.1 per cent or 326,799 tourists less compared with the corresponding period in 2014 according to the tourism arrival figures from China, in 1Q2015.\nThe new visa policy stipulates eight conditions to which tourists and tour operators must abide strictly said Wee Choo Keong, Malaysian tourism chairman. As per the conditions, the free visa will be granted to the tourist groups from China who are travelling with tour operators that are registered with the ministry of tourism and culture.\nIt is granted to the tourist group that consists of at least 20 tourists with temporary pass/free visa with validity limited to 15 days entry into Malaysia without further extension.\nFree visa will be granted to those who are travelling on a direct flight to Malaysia from China and have booked return flight tickets. Wee also said the approved entry points are Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Kota Kinabalu, Juching, Langwaki, Penang and Senai.\nThe tour operators who violate any conditions stipulated will be fined with RM 1500 (US$356) for each tourist.\nThis condition has been met with some dissatisfaction by the inbound tour operators, as it was felt that tour operators cannot have control over visitors who plan to overstay. This clause could make many operators weary and they may not wish to participate in bringing tour groups from China. The Malaysian Inbound tourism association feels that the government is trying to beef up arrivals but if their policy has loopholes how the tour operator can be held responsible and why do they need to pay fines for the whims of travellers.\nExperts feel that the suggested group strength should be reduced to 10 as now Chinese travel patterns have changes and they like to travel in small groups. Now most Chinese travellers are well heeled and they are not really concerned about spending, however hassle free visa procurement is definitely an incentive. The visa application fee is RMB80 (US$12.52) charged by the Malaysian government and a further RMB120 as service fee for visa processing.\nThis move will however boost the inflow of Chinese tourist to Malaysia felt Tan Kok Liang, vice president, inbound, at the Malaysian Association of Tour & Travel Agents (MATTA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:04:46.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
