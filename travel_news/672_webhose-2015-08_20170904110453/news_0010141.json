New flights to the Telluride/Montrose (MTJ) airport include New York-La Guardia on United, Los Angeles and Chicago on American, and Las Vegas with Allegiant. Dallas-Ft. Worth and Phoenix will also see major jumps in service to the area. \nNow with 14 direct flights from 11 major hubs, Telluride offers some of the best, most direct access in ski country. \nLast winter's additions included substantial increases from Dallas-Ft. Worth on American and New York/Newark on United, as well as new service from Phoenix on American to the Telluride/Montrose Airport (MTJ). The additions led to a record number of passengers traveling to the destination. \nWinter 2015-16 will see a full-scale increase in Telluride's American network, including another 50% addition from Dallas-Ft. Worth, more than doubling DFW service over the past two seasons. American will now offer a daily 128-seat mainline jet and two on Saturdays through the winter season from DFW to MTJ. Flights from Phoenix (PHX) will more than double this winter, and American is also adding new routes from Chicago (ORD) and Los Angeles (LAX). The increases in seats and flights will create an expansive American network for Telluride/Montrose, offering access from across the country on the newly merged airline. \n\"The creation of a national American network is a critical and significant addition to air service for Colorado's western slope and the Telluride/Montrose region, making getting to Telluride easier than ever,\" said Matt Skinner, chief operating officer of Colorado Flights. \nUnited, Colorado's primary carrier, will continue to expand on its already-existing network to Telluride/Montrose with the addition of highly sought-after flights from New York - La Guardia (LGA). MTJ's core hub service will continue with multiple daily, year-round flights from DEN, daily service from Houston and Chicago, along with weekend flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco. \n\"New York has long been Telluride's number one air market, and the addition of the highly coveted LaGuardia (LGA) route will be a fantastic addition for our existing guests and all skiers in the greater NY metro and beyond,\" said Skinner. \nKey low-cost partner Allegiant will shift service from Phoenix-Mesa to Las Vegas this winter, along with continued flights from LAX. Flights will now run on Fridays and Mondays the first half of the season, and Thursdays and Sundays the second half. \n\"With a growing young, active/outdoors demographic in Las Vegas, plus demand from Colorado to get to Las Vegas, Allegiant's LAS flight will be a great addition for the MTJ airport and Telluride/Montrose region,\" added Skinner. \nDelta will add Wednesdays to the existing Saturday/Sunday flights from Atlanta (ATL) in the second half of the season. \n\"We're absolutely thrilled with the significant additions to our air service, giving Telluride/Montrose some of the best access in ski country,\" said Skinner. \"Guests and residents alike now have multiple, varied options to travel non-stop to and from major hubs across country, easily connecting the whole of North America and the world.\" \n\"The direct economic impact of added flights is invaluable to the region, and we look forward to continued growth along with the major increases in air service,\" said Michael Martelon, CEO of the Telluride Tourism Board. \nSummary of additions for Telluride/Montrose (MTJ) winter air schedule includes: \nNew flights from: \n• New York-LaGuardia (LGA) on United • Chicago (ORD) on American • Los Angeles (LAX) on American • Las Vegas (LAS) on Allegiant \nMajor service additions from \n• Dallas – Ft.
