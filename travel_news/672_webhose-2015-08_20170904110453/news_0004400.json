British holidaymakers still comprise 55% of the 1.5 million stays up to July 2015, but the Italians were up 35%, Portuguese up 21% and Swedish up 8.8%. \nIn a statement the MHA said in a bid to attract “a more affluent and sophisticated guest”, hotels were also moving away from all-inclusive packages, which currently makes up around 30% of the Magaluf hotel market. \n“Following a greater willingness for guests to spend more, hotels are improving the quality of their complimentary facilities, which are more aligned with a higher standard of hotel guest,” it added. \n“The typical Magaluf tourist is steadily being replaced by families and more mature holidaymakers, which is affecting the season in two ways; firstly, by causing a fall in hotel occupancy (around 4% less in July 2015 than July 2014), but optimising at the same time the balance between occupancy and prices, in which an increase of 5-8% in prices lowers temporarily room occupancy but, in turn, helps to change the mix of customer profiles.” \nMeanwhile there has also been a decline in crime, constituting robberies, prostitution, hawking and drug dealing. The MHA said attributed this to the approval of new law-enforcement measures and a greater presence of both Spanish and, more recently, British police, antisocial behaviour in Punta Ballena and other nearby streets is in decline. \nThere were three arrests in 2015 compared with 23 in 2014. Meanwhile 50% fewer guests being expelled from hotels for bad behaviour. In addition there have been 50% fewer cases of balcony falls in Magaluf. \n“These measures, in addition to the shift of tourist profile, are directly contributing to the decrease in Punta Ballena Pub crawls from other destinations in Majorca,” the MHA said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T13:17:17.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
