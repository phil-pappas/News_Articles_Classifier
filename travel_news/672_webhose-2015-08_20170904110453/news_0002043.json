The university was congratulated for its strong architectural history and sustainability policy, with the Gateway Building singled out for its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives, including an air source heat pump and local farmland straw to insulate the internal walls. The Gateway Building is stage one of a 20-year master plan for the University of Nottingham, which includes the development of a new £40 million state-of-the-art sports village. Across their 350+ meeting, conference and event rooms and three sport centres, Nottingham Conferences and the University of Nottingham work closely to ensure environmentally friendly initiates are in place. Andrew May, General Manager of Nottingham Conferences commented: “At Nottingham Conferences we are passionate about limiting our environmental imprint and providing an example to venues to invest in green initiatives and technologies that matter. With the environment now at the forefront of event organiser’s minds and firmly top of the agenda, this is a timely award for us and we couldn’t be more honoured.” In addition to offering meeting, conference and events spaces across the university’s three campuses - Jubilee Campus, University Park and Sutton Bonington - Nottingham Conferences offers 4,000+ residential bedrooms which are available for hire 22 weeks of the year during the students’ Christmas, Easter and summer breaks.
