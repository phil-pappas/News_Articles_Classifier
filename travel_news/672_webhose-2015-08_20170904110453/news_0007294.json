Then South Korea on the same day sent a revised suggestion to the North asking for the attendance of (Korean People’s Army Vice Marshal) Hwang Pyong So instead of Kim Yang Gon.” \nKim Kyu-hyun indicated that the message had been favorably received. \n“Regarding our revised proposal, North Korea today at 9:30 a.m. stated Kim Yang Gon and Hwang Pyong So will attend, and asked for Kim Kwan-jin and (Blue House Secretary for Unification Issues) Hong Yong-pyo,” he said. “We accepted the position of the North, and suggested talks at 6 p.m. at the House of Peace at Panmunjom, and the North accepted it.” \nThe North had originally stated that the South had until 5 p.m. its time (5:30 KST) to remove its loudspeakers broadcasting anti-North messages or conflict would result. South Korean intelligence had indicated that the North was preparing for short-to-medium-range missile launches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T12:55:58.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
