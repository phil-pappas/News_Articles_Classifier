This event will take place in one of London’s finest hotels, The Dorchester, in order to inspire young job seekers about the career opportunities available within the hospitality and tourism industry. Rumi will host this with Matthew Davies from the Hyatt London Regency – The Churchill and Robin Vermeire from The Dorchester. The event will also form an integral part of Springboard’s Housekeeping Careers Festival, A Day to Sparkle, which is campaign to inspire, educate and change perceptions of careers and job opportunities within housekeeping and accommodation professions.\nThe BHA’s Big Hospitality Conversation has brought together more than 2,000 hospitality and tourism business to provide a platform that offers jobs, apprenticeships and work experience opportunities for young people. The BHC event also creates a friendly and informative conversation between industry leaders and young job seekers about the challenges of finding employment, but also about the great benefits of working in the hospitality and tourism industry. The BHA have so far created over 45,000 job opportunities within hospitality and tourism, and aim to create over 60,000 by 2016 for young job seekers.\nRumi (24) was one of the first people in Camden to benefit from the Hospitality Careers in Camden programme run by The Springboard Charity, and her success in turning her life around was recognised and she was asked to host the next Big Hospitality Conversation.\n“When I finish my A levels I didn’t know what to do next, I was unemployed for a while and has to sign on at the Job Centre. After 6 months I was referred to The Springboard Charity where I gained training which led me to starting an Apprenticeship in Housekeeping at The Corinthia Hotel. The Springboard Charity helped me gain quality work experience and training which led me to find a job that I love and without their support I would still be unemployed.”\nRumi continued “Housekeeping is not all about cleaning rooms; it’s about maintenance, laundry, customer service, everything that comes with making the running of a hotel smooth. Also starting your career in housekeeping gives you the opportunity to venture out into other departments within a hotel.”\n“I am so excited to host the Big Hospitality Conversation at The Dorchester this year as it’s great to be part of an initiative that supports careers in housekeeping. I believe that the housekeeping department is the heart of a hotel and there are great opportunities available to take advantage of as well as fast progression routes.”\nRumi is currently on an Apprenticeship programme called TopStars HK with Umbrella Training and is working at the Corinthia hotel.\nWhether you are a school, college, job seeker or business, Springboard is calling on you to get involved with The Housekeeping Careers Festival – A Day to Sparkle, where you can gain an insight into the vast progression routes and job opportunities available and celebrate the pride, skill and professionalism of Housekeeping and Accommodation staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T06:24:36.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
