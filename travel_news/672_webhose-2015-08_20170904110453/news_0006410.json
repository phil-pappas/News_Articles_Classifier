In its 34 th year, Inc. Magazine's list represents the most comprehensive look at an important segment of the economy-America's independent entrepreneurs. Joining the elite group which, over the years, included notably influential companies such as Microsoft, Timberland, Yelp, Pandora and Zappos.com, ResortShare has worked tirelessly to create a solid place in the travel and hospitality industry. Ranking in at number 569 , ResortShare made the top 12 percent of all the companies listed.\nFollowing recognition with its gold and bronze Best in Biz awards last week, ResortShare continues to collect numerous accolades for its proprietary technology and sustainable business model benefitting both consumer timeshare holders and resorts alike. Seeing a missing element in the travel and timeshare market, ResortShare took notice of the staggering amount of unused luxury rooms owned by timeshare owners and took the proactive step to alleviate the stress caused by yearly fees. By creating a highly advanced software platform that seamlessly connects timeshare owners with vacationers around the world, while simultaneously using a very hands-on approach with its customers through education and invaluable resources, ResortShare has created a system where both parties prosper through the sharing economy popularity.\n\"It is an incredible honor to be recognized amongst such respected companies in this year's Inc. 5000. Thanks to the creativity, dedication and synergetic team that is the heart of ResortShare, we earned the 569 th spot out of 5000 companies which is a significant feat. We have been able to surpass all expectations since the company's inception, proving ResortShare as a top contender,\" said Jay Yadon , co-founder and CEO of ResortShare. \"We look forward to constant growth and are even more motivated to continue the award-winning work we do for timeshare owners and travelers.\"\nThe 2015 Inc. 5000 is the most competitive crop in the list's history, with the average company on the list achieving a remarkable three-year growth of 490 percent. ResortShare revenue has grown an impressive 804 percent in the last three years, as well as added more than 50 jobs to its company. ResortShare has also received 2015 Inc. 500 honors, taking seventh place in the Top Travel & Hospitality companies.\n\"The story of this year's Inc. 5000 is the story of great leadership. In an incredibly competitive business landscape, it takes something extraordinary to take your company to the top,\" says Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg . \"You have to remember that the average company on the Inc. 5000 grew nearly six-fold since 2012. Business owners don't achieve that kind of success by accident.\"\nResortShare is committed to providing transparent and professional assistance in timeshare management, tools and knowledge. ResortShare brings vacationers together to make the most out of unused properties, monetizing unused properties for timeshare owners as well as timeshare Home Owners Associations. Creating solid relationships and unforgettable moments along the way, ResortShare's growth will continue, one timeshare owner at a time.
