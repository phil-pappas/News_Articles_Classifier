The transaction is expected to close by end of September.\nAbraaj said in a statement that diversification of services offered, in addition to the establishment of a new subsidiary in Chile, helped increase Condor Travel’s sales globally, and augmented its reputation as the leading specialty operator for tourists to Peru.\nIn 2014, Condor Travel served over 40,000 customers representing a 55 percent increase in customer traffic from 2010. In the same period, the average spend per customer increased by 56 percent, it added.\nHector Martinez, managing director of Abraaj’s Peru office said: “Our investment and partnership with Condor Travel helped create a leader in the Peruvian tourism market.\n“Condor Travel is well-positioned to maintain its market-leading status in the high-growth Peruvian tourism sector and we wish the company every success for the future.”\nAbraaj has been investing in the Pacific Alliance countries of Colombia, Mexico and Peru since 2008, across a range of sectors including retail, tourism, technology, food and beverage, and consumer goods.\nLast year, Abraaj exited its investment in leading Latin American retail company Iasacorp in Peru.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:06:34.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
