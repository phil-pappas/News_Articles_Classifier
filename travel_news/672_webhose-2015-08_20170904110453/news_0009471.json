Bringing together all characters in a succinct and entertaining narrative, the book tells the tale of Senior Inspector Hoshiyar Khan, who is called to solve a mystery about the murder of Nikhil Kapoor, Bollywood’s biggest film director and his wife — leading actress Mallika Kapoor. \nWhile most might think that the book would be like any other Bollywood drama, it delivers as good a story as a Hercule Poirot read, and keeps the reader engrossed till the very end. The suspense compels you to keep going through the pages. What the book lacks is maybe a stronger ­character base for the ­supporting characters. But it is definitely perfect script material and a must read for all Bollywood buffs out there. \nTitle: Murder In Bollywood", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:01:52.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
