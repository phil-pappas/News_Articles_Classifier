Morgan; background - HE Panda & Mrs. Panda eTN   \nIt is reported from the office of Seychelles' founding President Sir James R. Mancham, that Sir James has accepted the invitation of the Honorable Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala, President of the International Council of Jurists and who is also Chairman of All India Bar Association, to write the foreword to a book titled \"Narendra Modi - A Charismatic & Visionary Statesman,\" which will be released on the birthday of Prime Minister Modi on September 17, 2015. \nThe book which will be published in UK will be printed in Bangkok, Thailand, will be distributed throughout the world. Unlike the existing biographies on the Indian Prime Minister which focused on his childhood history and past political career, this book will contextualize the Prime Minister's emergence as a charismatic and visionary leader. It will show how the existing social, political, economic, religious and ideological environment shaped and reshaped Modi's character and influence his growth as a futuristic leader. \nThe idea of the book came up during the International Conference of Jurists and Writers which took place in London on June 23-24, 2014, when eminent members of the judiciary, bar, jurists, writers and journalists from different parts of the world, expressed a deep and intense desire to know more about India's new Prime Minister. \nAccording to the Honorable Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala - \"Ever since Modiji became India's Prime Minister in May 2014, there has been a huge buzz, enthusiasm and excitement among investors, both foreign and Indian. Most of them have heard about the unique, innovative, efficient, effective, transparent, corruption-free, democratic, and inclusive Model of Governance which Prime Minister Modi fine-tuned and perfected during his almost 13-year-tenure (2001-2014) as Chief Minister of Gujarat. However, the majority of investors, especially foreigners, are still not clear about the details and specifics of the Model. Most have heard about it by word-of-mouth, read about it in newspaper and magazine articles, or spoken to some insiders and outsiders who are aware of Modi's achievements. But they are still not sure about two issues: How will that Model of Governance help them invest in the country, or even whether the Model is reason enough to invest in India? Can the Gujarat Model, which was successful in a single state, be replicated across India, or can the Modi Vision transcend the differences, contradictions and variations in different states? \nThe book therefore is an attempt to convince existing and potential investors about the huge opportunities that India will throw up in the future because of Modiji's style of governance. Apart from helping them understand the character of the Prime Minister, and the internal and external influences that shaped in, it will provide comprehensive insight into his Model of Governance, and its ability to be scaled up across the country.\" \nSir James who received the International Council Jurists Award for Statesmanship at the Preliminary Hall in Vigyan Bhawan, India, on December 11, 2010, \"in recognition of the pivotal role played by him in promoting peaceful settlement of international disputes and who is considered to have influenced many world leaders with his contemporary philosophy and outlook\" and who met and was impressed by Prime Minister Modi during his official visit to Seychelles in March 2015, said that he felt deeply honored to have been asked to write the Foreword to this historic book. \n\"With slow growth in most developed nations and possible collaboration between China and India in the field of economic performance, India can prove to be the engine for the overall growth of the global economy. Given this scenario, the economic vision of India's political leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be crucial. From what I have witnessed in the last 15 months, his policies seem futuristic, visionary, and result-orientated. This could enable the other economies to leverage and piggyback the possible double-digit growths in India. Within 15 months, Mr. Modi has proved that he is a global leader par excellence. With foreign trips to nearly 22 nations, he has emerged as a diplomat who can interact on equal terms with global superpowers like Germany, France, the US and China and also take along small nations like Seychelles and Mauritius. It is obvious that what India needs is real development not necessarily perform to win elections and woo voters but to transform the country and its people. Mr. Modi's aim is to build a New India - a country that will stand strong, firm and respected in the 21st century. I have therefore accepted with pride and humility to write the Foreword to this unique work by two eminent writers and jurists of international repute, Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Ms. Sarah J. Marchington, fully convinced that this monumental work will provide growing guidance to statesmen, politicians, scholars of politics and interested governments into what they believe India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his vision is all about,\" Sir James stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:06:55.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
