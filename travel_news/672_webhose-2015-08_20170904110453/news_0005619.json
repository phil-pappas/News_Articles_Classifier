(Nasdaq: EGLE) today announced its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 .\nFor the Second Quarter:\nNet loss of $27.5 million or $0.73 per share for the Company, compared with net loss of $44.7 million , or $2.61 per share for the comparable quarter of 2014. Net revenues of $22.7 million , compared to $42.4 million for the comparable quarter in 2014. Fleet utilization rate of 97.5%. Sold the M/V Kite, a 1997-built Handymax for net proceeds of $4.2 million and recorded loss on sale of $5.7 million . On May 20, 2015 , Eagle Bulk delivered a 90 day termination notice to terminate its Pool arrangement with Navig8. Subsequent Events:\nOn July 7, 2015 , the Company announced that it appointed Gary Vogel as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective as of September 1, 2015 . Mr. Vogel will be joining as a member of the Company Board and Mr. Ryan will be stepping down from his role as CEO and will remain a Board member. On August 14, 2015 , the Company entered into an Amendatory Agreement with its lenders. Pursuant to the Amendatory Agreement, the lenders have agreed to, among other things, defer the compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 . Stanley H. Ryan , CEO, commented, \"Despite ongoing weakness in the dry bulk market, Eagle Bulk continued to make progress during the second quarter upgrading our fundamentals and transitioning to an operating platform that delivers sustainable value through diverse market cycles. The credit amendment we announced today – which provides financial flexibility and the benefit of time – will help ensure that this momentum continues. Looking ahead, the Company's focus will be on continued business improvements, fleet renewal and growth, and accelerated efforts to ensure that Eagle Bulk is optimally-positioned to capture current and future market opportunities.\"\nResults of Operations for the three-month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014\nFor the second quarter of 2015, the Company reported a net loss of $27,508,300 or $0.73 per share, based on a weighted average of 37,639,352 basic and diluted shares outstanding. In the comparable second quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $44,660,059 or $2.61 per share, based on a weighted average of 17,079,991 basic and diluted shares outstanding.\nGross time and voyage charter revenues in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $23,853,039 , compared with $44,194,434 recorded in the comparable quarter in 2014. The decrease in revenue is attributable to lower charter rates earned by the fleet, reduced available days due to drydocking of an increased number of vessels and the sale of one vessel, the M/V Kite, in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 . Brokerage commissions incurred on revenues earned in the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $1,195,667 and $1,814,375 , respectively. Net revenues during the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, were $22,657,372 and $42,380,059 , respectively.\nTotal operating expenses for the Company in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 were $47,011,056 compared with $50,489,321 recorded for the Company in the comparable quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from a reduction in the Depreciation expense of $8,455,446 due to lower vessel valuation upon adoption of Fresh-Start Accounting , offset by additional charter hire expense of $1,233,132 and loss on sale of M/V Kite $5,696,675 in the second quarter of 2015.\nResults of Operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 and 2014\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2015 , the Company reported a net loss of $48,175,364 or $1.28 per share, based on a weighted average of 37,583,491 basic and diluted shares outstanding. In the comparable period of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $67,249,945 or $3.94 per share, based on a weighted average of 17,080,079 basic and diluted shares outstanding.\nGross time and voyage charter revenues in the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 were $51,564,828 , compared with $92,054,896 recorded in the comparable period in 2014. The decrease in revenue is attributable to lower charter rates earned by the fleet, reduced available days due to drydocking of an increased number of vessels and the sale of one vessel, the M/V Kite in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 . Brokerage commissions incurred on revenues earned in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $2,576,290 and $3,879,446 , respectively. Net revenues during the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, were $48,988,538 and $88,175,450 , respectively.\nTotal operating expenses for the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $90,850,075 compared with $99,104,863 recorded for the Company in the comparable period of 2014. The decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from a reduction in the Depreciation expense of approximately $16,976,088 due to lower vessel value upon adoption of Fresh-Start Accounting on October 15, 2014 , offset by higher charter hire expense of $2,449,096 , loss on sale of the M/V Kite of $5,696,675 and higher general and administrative expenses primarily due to increase in non cash compensation expense and adviser's fees for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014 .\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash used in operating activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was $23,328,501 , compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $593,725 during the corresponding six-month period ended June 30, 2014 . The decrease is primarily due to lower charter rates on time charter renewals and higher drydock expenditures.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2015, was $8,635,658 , compared with net cash used in investing activities of $186,201 during the corresponding six-month period ended June 30, 2014 . The increase is primarily due to proceeds of $4,235,542 from the sale of the M/V Kite and proceeds of $5,807,917 from the sale of KLC shares.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 was $1,901,994 , compared with none during the corresponding six-month period ended June 30, 2014 . We borrowed $15,000,000 from our revolver credit facility and we repaid $11,812,500 toward our term loan.\nAs of June 30, 2015 , our cash balance was $27,184,438 , compared to a cash balance of $39,975,287 at December 31, 2014 .\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company's debt consisted of $228,187,500 in term loans and debt discount of $4,068,755 . The Company availability under the revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2015 is $35 million .\nCapital Expenditures and Drydocking\nOur capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels.\nIn addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, the other major capital expenditures include funding the Company's program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Although the Company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its drydocking, the costs are relatively predictable. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years. We anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period.\nDrydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels. Fourteen vessels completed drydocking in the six months ended June 30, 2015 while one other vessel was still in drydock as of June 30, 2015 . We incurred $8,505,455 in drydocking related costs during the six month period ended June 30, 2015 . Three vessels completed drydocking in the six months ended June 30, 2014 while one other vessel was still in drydocking as of June 30, 2014 and we incurred $2,391,412 in drydocking related costs. The following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters, along with the anticipated off-hire days:\nQuarter Ending\nOff-hire Days(1)\nProjected Costs(2)\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2015\n44\n$1.30\nDecember 31, 2015\n-\n-\nMarch 31, 2016\n88\n$2.60\nJune 30, 2016\n44\n$1.30\n(1)Actual duration of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel, yard schedules and other factors.

The time charter hire rates presented are gross daily charter rates before brokerage commissions, ranging from 1.25% to 5.00%, to third party ship brokers.\n(2)\nThese vessels are operating in a dry bulk pool for a period between 8 to 14 months. On May 20, 2015, the Company delivered a 90 day termination notice to Navig8 to terminate the Pool arrangements for all of its vessels in the Pool. The notice of termination was given pursuant to the terms of the Company's pool agreement.\n(3)\nUpon conclusion of the drydocking the vessel will commence a short term charter for up to six months or re enter the dry bulk pool.\nGlossary of Terms:\nOwnership days: The Company defines ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in its fleet has been owned. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that is recorded during a period.\nChartered-in under operating lease days: The Company defines chartered-in under operating lease days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which the Company chartered-in vessels.\nAvailable days: The Company defines available days as the number of ownership days less the aggregate number of days that its vessels are off-hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition, scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nOperating days: The Company defines operating days as the number of its available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\nFleet utilization: We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. Our fleet continues to perform at high utilization rates.\nAbout Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc.\nEagle Bulk Shipping Inc. is a Marshall Islands corporation headquartered in New York .

Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and may include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.\nThe forward-looking statements in this release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.\nImportant factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including changes in charter hire rates and vessel values, changes in demand that may affect attitudes of time charterers to scheduled and unscheduled drydocking, changes in our vessel operating expenses, including dry-docking and insurance costs, or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from future litigation, domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents and political events or acts by terrorists.\nRisks and uncertainties are further described in reports filed by Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\nVisit our website at www.eagleships.com\n releases/eagle-bulk-shipping-inc-reports-second-quarter-2015-results-300128883.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eagle-bulk-shipping-inc-reports-second-quarter-2015-results-300128883.html", "http://www.eagleships.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY80085&Transmission_Id=201508141630PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY80085&DateId=20150814", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T15:00:36.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
