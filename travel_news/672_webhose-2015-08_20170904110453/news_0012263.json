He wore a beret and as he gripped the steering wheel, dodging potholes, he'd occasionally bark out streams of mystifying Mongolian. \nIn Russia, a UAZ van is known as a Bukhanka, or bread loaf, because of its boxy appearance. \nWith impressive suspension, these off-road vehicles can be seen across Mongolia, rugged as the country's vast grasslands. As we soon learned. \nSuddenly, without warning, Ogii veered off the highway, hit the gas and accelerated across the scrubby landscape and up a hillside. Within minutes, he had brought us to a 360-degree view of the steppes - with flocks of animals grazing in the distance, next to groups of white yurts, or gers as they are called here. \nThis is what travel is like in Mongolia: Huge distances. Broad vistas. Big skies. Bright stars. \nOgii makes a version of Mongolian hot pot over an outdoor wood stove at Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur.

Ad Feedback \nCovering 603,000 square miles - roughly the size of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Utah combined - Mongolia is vast, but home to a mere 3 million people. Half of them live in Ulaanbaatar, the capital. Most of the rest are spread out on the grasslands, making a traditional living herding and breeding livestock. \nYet even in the outback, signs of modernisation are everywhere. \nOn our first day on the road, we came across a large flock of camels, including some newborns. \nThe camels made for excellent photos, but we were surprised by the two shepherds that soon arrived. They were riding a motorcycle. \nShepherds move a flock of camels away from the road.

Inside her ger, Yandag was making a batch of urum, the Mongolian name for clotted cream, or \"white butter.\" She soon stepped outside to track her livestock with the aid of some high-quality binoculars. \nOutside her ger stood solar panels and a satellite dish, for watching television. \nSome Mongolians fret about the rapid change that is sweeping their country. One of these is Oyuntsetseg Suidaan - Oyuna - an Ulaanbaatar college English teacher who was our tour guide on the trip. \nOyuna isn't nostalgic about the communist days of a quarter-century ago, when Mongolia was still a closed-off Soviet satellite. But she also doesn't want her country to forget its history and customs. \n\"Little by little in the city, we are losing our traditions, our character,\" she lamented one day, as we discussed Mongolia's full-throttled embrace of capitalism. \"We are becoming selfish.\" \nPerhaps that is why Oyuna chose to bring her 12-year-old daughter, Khuslen, on the trip. All of us were charmed by Khuslen and her unbridled enthusiasm. As for Oyuna, she seem delighted that her little city girl could experience the character of the countryside. \nIn every ger camp we visited, families would invite us inside and offer us something, usually suutei tsai - salty milk tea. As we sipped our drinks and chatted, we took note of the colourful, ornate furniture inside these tents, including the altars festooned with photos of several generations of family. \nAltai sits in the lone remaining Buddhist temple in Erdiin Khamblin Khiid in Central Mongolia.

More than 300 of these golden horses now roam the park, the result of a successful reintroduction project supported by the Dutch and Mongolian governments. \nFurther west is Khogno Khan Uul Nature Reserve, which is dotted with remains of old Buddhist temples, and one active one. You can camp here, explore the ruins and hike up a lovely creek into hills filled with wildflowers. \nMany schedule their tours through Mongolia to catch one or more of the Nadaams - local festivals held in July and early August. These festivals, which celebrate Mongolian wrestling, archery and horse racing, are true spectacles. One of the most colourful is at Karakorum. \nBack in the mid-1300s, Karakorum was the capital of Mongolia, made so by the heirs of Genghis Khan. But the city's glory didn't last long. When Kublai Khan conquered China, he decided to move the capital to Beijing. The city's residents have never forgiven him for that. \nBut Karakorum is making a comeback. At the fairgrounds, crowds of people attended the Nadaam, some arriving on horses, some in new Toyota Land Cruisers. Troupes of sequined girls danced before an appreciative audience. Young men sat tall in the saddle, taking selfies of each other. Older women practiced archery. A nearby polo match kicked up a dust storm. \nTwo wrestling contestants face off at the Nadaam festival in Karakorum. Photo: Stuart Leavenworth \nEvery day seemed to bring some new visual splendour. We passed by a deep gorge that looked like a tributary to the Grand Canyon. We camped at a lake so vast and undeveloped that you just wanted to stare at it for hours. \nBut the thing I'll remember most was a toast on the first night of our trip. Ogii, our driver, pulled out shot glasses and a bottle of Mongolian vodka. He insisted that we partake, and of course, how could say no? \nThe customary Mongolian toast involves dipping your right ring finger into the glass and flicking it three or four times. First we toasted the sky, then the earth. The last time we touched our fingers to our foreheads, gave thanks, and knocked back the shot. \nWe all did this. By the end of it, we felt like we were all members of a time-honoured, secret club. \nGers (yurts) sit on the shore of Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur, a lake in central Mongolia.

Costs for a seven-day trip are about US$665 ($1024) per person for three people, which includes a driver, a guide, a van, lodging, food and tours. It does not include airfare. If Meg's is booked, Lonely Planet has suggestions for other tour companies. \nConnections: Ulaanbaatar is served by flights from China, Japan, South Korea and other countries. Mongolia makes for a relaxing diversion after a week of touring China. \nPreparations: A sleeping bag and a pad can be helpful for sleeping in gers, which may or may not have mattresses. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:15:12.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
