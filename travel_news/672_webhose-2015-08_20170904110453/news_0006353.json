Progress is underway on the remaining steps to make this plan a reality.\n“There are more moving parts in this development than a fine Swiss watch, but we hope to create a great long-term home for the bank’s operations and corporate offices. Meanwhile, the citizens of Columbus will be able to enjoy these local landmarks of national significance in the history of aviation,” said G. Scott McComb, Chairman, President and CEO.\n“However, we’re very early in this process. In order to be feasible, the project will require State and Federal tax credits, City of Columbus tax abatements, FAA approval, an acceptable construction and build out budget, and placing the hangar on the National Register of Historic Places. If all goes well, we could be in our new headquarters by late 2016.”\nThe original terminal building and TAT hangar opened July 8, 1929, as a stop on the nation’s first transcontinental passenger service. The coast-to-coast service included daytime flights on TAT, one of the nation’s first airlines, and overnight transport on trains, as early time aircraft weren’t equipped for night travel. About 3,000 people were at Port Columbus to witness the inaugural flight of two Ford Tri-Motor aircraft with 19 passengers, including aviatrix Amelia Earhart.\n“It’s fitting that Heartland Bank, a strong community partner for over 100 years, is leading the efforts to preserve an important element of the community and the nation’s history,” said Elaine Roberts, President & CEO of CRAA. “We look forward to a long-term partnership with Heartland to ensure their success in their new headquarters.”\nSource:- Columbus Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:58:00.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
