Do you think the weather cares that you're having a picnic? Well it doesn't!\nAnyway, what came as little surprise was Phoenix Park taking home the number one spot with 12%. The park is one of the largest enclosed recreational spaces within any European city, so we were kind of expecting it. Not only does it have the beautiful greeny parts, but there's deer too, and who doesn't love them? Monsters, monsters don't love them, so we're glad to hear that it took first place.\nSecond on the list was Glendalough with 11% of the vote. Carved out of the Wicklow Mountains by glaciers during the Ice Age, the valley’s rich monastic heritage and many scenic trails proves popular with picnickers, but we have a feeling it's more to do with the fact that it looks like Twilight was shot there. That's probably why it was also named Ireland’s most romantic picnic spot with 9%.\nRounding out the top three is Fota Wildlife Park, Co. Cork. The joint project between the Zoological Society of Ireland and UCC is set on 70 acres of land, so if you're looking for a private picnic, this is probably your spot. Having said that, be careful of all the animals because, you know, it's a wildlife park.\nIf the journey to all of those is too long for you, or you've been too far too many times, you could always try some of the other top locations like Kylemore Abbey, Co. Galway, which at 8% is Ireland’s top luxury picnic spot, or the most picturesque picnic spot in all the land, the Giant’s Causeway, Co. Antrim, which took in 13% of the vote.\nMORE: Watch: Little Pomeranian puppy has the most incredible sneeze\nMORE: You can turn your phone into a hologram projector for less than a fiver\nMORE: Watch: Woman lost in a forest for 3 days gives birth, fights bees and starts forest fire", "external_links": ["http://www.keoghs.ie/"], "published": "2015-07-31T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:01:20.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
