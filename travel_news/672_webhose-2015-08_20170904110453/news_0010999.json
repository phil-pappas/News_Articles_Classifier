This aptly applies to the tourism sector in Spain which is laughing all the way to records. Spain has witnessed a record 38 million tourists in the first seven months of the year, say authorities.\nThis has been possible partly due to weak euro and partly due to security issues in other beach resort nations like Tunisia.\nThe period from January-July witnessed a record increase of 4.7 percent tourist arrivals against the same period in 2014, states the state tourism office. July witnessed a record number of 8.8 million visitors, up 6.3 percent as compared to July 2014.\nBritish tourists were on the top of the list with nearly nine million arrivals.\nWith the record numbers, Spain is all upbeat to achieve 68 million in 2015 which is three million more than the record set in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:31:16.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
