(Erika Schultz/The Seattle Times) By Brian J. Cantwell Seattle Times travel writer \nAre the dog days of August making you itchy ? Get out of town. Here are three ideas to get you on the road this weekend. \n1. MusicFest NW rocks Portland’s Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park. Headliners include indie pop act Foster the People, seminal rockers Belle and Sebastian, and Northwest legend (with Issaquah roots) Modest Mouse. The lineup of 18 bands playing on two stages over three days is promised to include “the coolest bands your friends haven’t heard of.” Friday, Aug. 21-Sunday, Aug. 23; Tickets include one-day pass, $45-$60; 3-day pass $140. Strings of kites fill the air during a past kite festival at Long Beach. (Bill Wagner/AP) \n2. Expect fresh and cool ocean air with no wildfire smoke at Long Beach this weekend for the finale of the annual Washington State International Kite Festival , one of the world’s top events for people who like to fly things on strings. Friday there’s a lighted-kite night fly at 8 p.m. Saturday includes a 1 p.m. Parade of Colors on the boardwalk, a Rokkaku Challenge featuring Japanese fighter kites, a mass ascension (how many kites can fly in that sky?), evening fireworks and more. Through Sunday, Aug. 23; on the beach, near the Bolstad Avenue Beach Approach; most events free, parking $2. Downtown Roslyn hosts an art festival this weekend. (Erika Schultz/The Seattle Times) \n3. Get a taste of small-town Washingtonia, and maybe pick up something framed for that blank wall in the kitchen, during the Roslyn Art Festival . There’s a juried art show, a Saturday wine reception, live music, artisan booths, and Try-It Art stations around the quaint and historic downtown. 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 22, and 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 23, Roslyn Warehouse, on Pennsylvania Avenue, and around downtown Roslyn, Kittitas County. Wine reception, $35. Brian J. Cantwell", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T23:02:50.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
