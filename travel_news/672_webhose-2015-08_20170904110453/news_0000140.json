Dr Saul Villeda, of Stanford’s School of Medicine, injected old mice with the blood of young mice and made some interesting discoveries. They found that the injected mice experienced a burst of brain cell growth in the hippocampus and had up to four times as many newborn neurons as mice the same age who had not been injected with the blood. Concurrently, young mice who were injected with the blood of old mice experienced the opposite: the birth of new neurons was stalled and they were left looking older than their actual age. With the experiments producing positive results, the findings are now being tested on humans so it may be a while before we find out if 'vampire therapy' really is the key to anti-ageing. Here are some of the strangest anti-ageing techniques around: Snail slime Snail slime can help the recovery of skin cells on the face Photo: Ivan Hugo To most they're simply garden pests, but to others live snails are an elixir for youthful and beautiful skin . Snail slime is rich in proteins, antioxidants and hyaluronic acid, which helps skin retain moisture, reduce inflammation and remove dead skin. A clinic in Tokyo uses a treatment that involves placing snails directly onto the face, allowing the snails to move around as they please, leaving a trail of slime all over the face. The Telegraph tried the 'snail facial' and found the end result to be a \"cooler and plumper\" face post treatment. If you can't stomach the idea of allowing snails to crawl over your face, many skincare companies sell products infused with snail secretion , producing a cream that they claim does not only moisturise the skin and fight the signs of ageing, but also causes scars to fade Sheep placenta facial Harry Styles is a fan of sheep placenta facials Photo: Rex In 2013, Kim Kardashian made headlines for partaking in a vampire facial - blood is drawn out of the arm and then splattered onto the face using acupuncture needles. In 2015, celebrities prefer something a little less bloody: sheep placenta facials. Victoria Beckham and Harry Styles are both rumoured to be fans of the treatment that involves taking the placenta from New Zealand sheep, and then extracting the stem cells, which are said to be full of nutrients that fight skin damage. After the stem cells are extracted, they're then flash frozen and mixed into a gel which is then slathered over the face. Dermatologist Dr Annie Chiu says the unusual facials are: \"Chock-full of nutrients from the placenta, things like growth factors, nutrients, amino acids.\" Dr Chui also mixed the placenta extract with 24-karat gold flakes, \"to give the clients a golden glow.\" Anti-ageing acorns Save money on beauty treatments and keep an acorn in your pocket Photo: Alamy In Ancient Britain, women believed the key to looking young was to carry an acorn in your pocket. There doesn't appear to be any scienfitic merit to this theory but, in The Encyclopedia of Superstitions , Richard Webster writes: \"Acorn amulets have always been popular, as they are believed to protect the person from illness and disease. Acorns were one of the earliest foods, and the people who ate them believed the provided fecundity and longevity. \"An ancient tradition in Britain says that a woman can keep herself young by carrying an acorn on her person. This is because oak trees are long living.\" Sake baths Sake baths are said to posses many health and beauty benefits Photo: Film Stills If your is showing signs of ageing, a Sake bath may be what you're looking for. Sake, a Japanese rice wine , contains an antioxidant called ferulic acid which, as well as having an anti-ageing effect on the body, also absorbs UV light. The ferulic acid stop signs of ageing on your skin by keeping wrinkles, sun spots, age spots, and freckles at bay. Sake baths are also said to help improve your circulation, keeping people up to 1℃ warmer for a longer time than normal bath. To enjoy the benefits of a Sake bath, it is recommended you at between 400-900ml of Sake to a hot bath tub - though experts warn not to stay in for too long as you may get drunk from the evaportated Sake. Bird poo facial Fiona Duncan gets a nightingale dropping facial With David and Victoria Beckham reported to be fans, facials using the excrement of the nightingale bird have gained popularity in the Western world in recent years. The droppings are collected and dried under UV lights, and then mixed with rice bran and water before applied as a face mask. The facial is said to whiten the skin, balance skin tone, and treat skin that has been affected by hyperpigmentation, acne, or sun damage. The Telegraph's hotel expert Fiona Duncan braved the potential smell and reported positive results : \"Definitely brighter, cleaner, smoother than an hour before. Positively glowing, in fact.\" @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:45:58.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
