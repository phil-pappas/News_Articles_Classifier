But we must eliminate snags in the integration process. We have countries in the continent that are sending other Africans away. How can we talk about integration when African people cannot move freely in the continent?” Mr. Muluzi questioned. \nMuluzi noted that with a visa requirement out of the way and the right infrastructure put in place for the exchange of goods and services, the African continent would take off faster and change the lives of those who call it home. \nFormer Nigerian President Mr. Olesegun Obasanjo asked, “How can Africa trade within the continent, when there is no free movement?” \nMr. Obasanjo noted that there are some progresses being made towards an integrated Africa, taking a good example of West Africa. He told the other former African leaders that integration would be the best thing for Africa. \n“What we need to do in order to speed the integration process is to abolish visa in Africa,” said Mr. Obasanjo. “West African countries have done it, and it is working.” \n“There is no evidence to suggest that insecurity has escalated in West African countries because of free movement of people,” Obasanjo said, adding that if anything, citizens of West Africa are now more integrated than the rest of the continent. \nFormer Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings noted that the abolition of visas has been working well among members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). \nRawlings noted that integration was about movement of people, which was hampered by current strict visa requirements in many African countries, adding that complete abolition was the best way forward. \nHe said the West African region had made great strides on free movement and where there is a high movement of people and goods compared to the rest of the African continent. Rwanda and Mauritius emerged as a good example of African states which dropped the visa requirement to African travelers and other nationalities entering those nations. \nFor the integration process to take place smoothly, Africa needs knowledgeable and skilled people and fearful leaders, said former Namibian President, Hifikepunye Pohamba. \nBut, Ugandan President, Mr. Yoweri Museveni, who is still in power, defended his stance on leading Uganda, saying it was nonsense to discuss the time limit for an African leader to be in power. \n“You waste a lot of energy and time thinking about who is doing what instead of focusing on what is being done,” Museveni said. \nThe African Leadership Forum themed, “Moving towards an integrated Africa,” is made up of a panel of retired African presidents. \nAfrica is made up of 54 countries which are looking to move in one direction at a go, said the former leaders. \nRecognizing Africa’s tourist and travel potential, the Africa Travel Association (ATA), leader in promoting tourism to Africa, will hold its 40th Annual World Congress in Nairobi, Kenya, from November 9 to 14 this year. \nATA Executive Director Edward Bergman said the tourism and travel stakeholders were eager to return to Kenya for this milestone ATA history. \n“We are delighted to bring together the public and private sectors, travel industry, and media to participate in the congress,” said Eddie. \nThis also comes at an important time to showcase Kenyan tourism aiming to show the world that Kenya is an incredible destination and is open for business and deserves global attention. \n“We encourage the travel industry to stand with Kenya and support tourism,” Eddie said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:50:41.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
