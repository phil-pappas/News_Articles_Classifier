Another 24 kiosks will be introduced in Terminal 3 subsequently.\nFor passengers with baggage to check in, FAST check-in is a simple two-step process. They first obtain their boarding pass and bag tags at the kiosks. Once they have tagged their bags, passengers drop them off at the bag drop counters. There are instructional videos, signs and staff on ground to guide passengers on this process.\nPassengers with carry-on bags only may print their boarding passes at the kiosks and proceed directly to Departure Immigration. Alternatively, passengers who have done online or mobile check-in may also skip the counters and proceed to Departure Immigration with their home-printed or mobile phone boarding passes (offered on selected itineraries).\nBased on past trials conducted by CAG, 97% of passengers polled indicated that they were satisfied with the FAST check-in experience and would consider using it again. The entire FAST check-in sequence – including printing of boarding pass and bag tags, together with tagging and baggage drop off – can be done in a matter of minutes. The time taken is expected to reduce as travellers gain familiarity with this mode of processing, given the growing use of automated check-in options in airports around the world.\nIn addition to providing passengers with a faster and more flexible check-in experience, automation will also help raise efficiency and productivity of check-in operations, thereby providing cost savings for airlines.\nMr Jayson Goh, CAG’s Senior Vice President for Airport Operations Management, said: “The adoption of FAST initiatives is in line with a wider global push towards self-service options at airports to improve productivity and efficiency, while at the same time providing passengers with greater flexibility and convenience. CAG is pleased to partner Singapore Airlines and SilkAir on the FAST journey and will work closely with the airlines to continuously refine the process where necessary, so as to bring about a greater travel experience for our passengers.”\n“We welcome the new FAST initiatives, which will streamline the check-in process for our customers. This reflects our ongoing efforts to offer customers more options and improve their travel experience with us,” said Mr Tan Pee Teck, Singapore Airlines Senior Vice President Product & Services.\n“We are pleased to see the introduction of the various FAST initiatives to our customers, which will provide them with a more seamless check-in experience and contribute to the overall enhancement of our customers’ journey with us,” said Mr Goh Boon Hwee, SilkAir’s Vice President Operations.\nSource:- Changi Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:58:21.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
