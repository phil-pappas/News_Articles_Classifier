We believe in offering the best possible service to our customers and our new contract includes service level enhancements that will result in improvements in punctuality and a better experience for our customers. The new company was selected by Aurigny after a competitive tendering process. Airline Services has an excellent track record and serves, amongst others, Turkish Airlines and Monarch. \nMalcolm Coupar, Aurigny’s Commercial Director, says: “We are confident that Airline Services will deliver an excellent standard of service to our customers and any changes that they notice will be positive ones. Aurigny flies into London’s Gatwick airport six times a day on weekdays and five times a day at weekends, meaning we’re an important and regular customer. In fact, we operate more flights there than other, much bigger airlines.” Andy Cruise, Sales Director of Airline Services Handling adds: “We are delighted to start work with Aurigny, an award winning and dynamic regional airline. Punctuality and reliability are an important part of their offering and we are committed to ensuring that our handling mirrors their goals. We have built up our operation at Gatwick Airport extensively over the past nine months and are looking forward to supporting such a reputable and established operator.” Passengers will still check in at the same desk in the South Terminal and should enjoy a timely, informed and polite service each time they fly into or out of Gatwick, London’s second busiest airport, with Aurigny.
