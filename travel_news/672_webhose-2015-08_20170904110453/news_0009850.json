In airports, passenger screening involves pat-down search and the use of passenger screening systems (such as metal detectors or full body scanners) to ensure the security and safety. Initially, hand-held and walk-through metal detectors were used to screen passengers at airports. But, as a result of the growing air traffic, advanced passenger screening systems (based on backscatter X-ray and millimeter wave technology) are largely being used at airports worldwide.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global airport passenger screening systems market to grow at a CAGR of 4.02% over the period 2014-2019.\nCovered in this report\nIn this report, Technavio covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global airport passenger screening systems market for 2015-2019.
