Spotting a passing sea turtle, a Hawaiian monk seal , or a pod of dolphins is entirely possible.\nMost of all, the voyage is rewarding.\nAs you paddle past stunning mountains and verdant valleys, your arms and core will get an intense (and fun!) workout. Some tours, such as the 17-mile guided trip offered by Napali Kayak , are long and physically demanding, so a sufficient level of physical fitness is essential.\nA number of secluded beaches lay nestled below the spectacular mountain range. Milolii beach is a popular spot to stop for a relaxing lunch and a quick swim. However, it is illegal to dock a kayak at most of the other beaches along the coast, including Hanakapi’ai and Honopu. Luckily, you can still see their beauty from the water.\nAnd when you discover one of the many sea caves scattered along the coast, kayaking through it is a must. Maneuvering through the remarkabl blue grottos and draping waterfalls is as magical as it gets.\nBelow, peer into the enchanted waterways of Hawaii's most inspiring coastline.\nA photo posted by based in Austrian (@anyonetakespictures) on Jun 15, 2015 at 4:29pm PDT\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.napalikayak.com/napali-day-trip/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/04/napali-coast/joel-bourne-text?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.unrealhawaii.com/2011/07/kalalau-trail/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlgJRN%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlgC9H.img&description=tedjohnjacobs+via+Getty+Images+-+tedjohnjacobs+via+Getty+Images", "https://instagram.com/p/39-DLNozQO/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/kauai/napali-coast-state-wilderness-park/boating/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.seattletimes.com/life/travel/kayaking-in-kauai-its-all-about-the-sea-caves/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/14/hawaiian-monk-seal-comeback_n_5968536.html?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T04:32:21.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
