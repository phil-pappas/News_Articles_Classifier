Tupelo will be open from Monday, Aug. 24 to Friday, Oct. 23, 2015, in the resort’s Riva restaurant space. Dinner service will begin at 6 p.m. daily. \n\nThe concept’s imaginative menu consists of a variety of small and large plates — along with sweet treats — perfectly paired with a creative list of hand-crafted cocktails. The menu is thoughtfully designed to encourage sharing and emphasize fresh, seasonal, high quality and locally sourced ingredients. \n\nPlates at the Fort Lauderdale restaurant will include warm cheddar biscuits with honey butter ($9), smoked fish dip with grilled bread ($11) and roasted beets served with a parsley-walnut pesto, arugula and goat cheese ($14). Guests will also be able to share several farm-to-table inspired items including the rock shrimp pasta with garlic, tomato and basil ($17); seared scallops with creamy polenta and charred corn succotash ($19); roasted chicken with chorizo rice grits and black bean puree ($21); and Palmetto Creek Farms Jim’s pork chop hickory rubbed, served with smashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts and mustard ($30). Tupelo’s delectable desserts include fresh berries and cream — tupelo honey and shortbread ($12); warm chocolate brownie — walnuts, dulce de leche and vanilla ice cream ($12); and an old-fashioned favorite – root beer float ($10). \n\nThe 128-seat pop-up restaurant’s upbeat music will accentuate the Riva space’s personable and inviting atmosphere. The dining room’s communal tables will encourage warm and friendly interactions among diners. \n\nA South Florida native, Grenier has spent much of her career at 3030 Ocean under the tutelage of acclaimed chefs Paula DaSilva and Dean Max. In 2011, Grenier’s work with DaSilva at 1500 Degrees at Eden Roc Renaissance Miami Beach helped win the restaurant a coveted spot as the only Florida restaurant in food critic John Mariani’s annual Esquire magazine feature, “The Best New Restaurants in America.” Her passion for food and cooking also led her to become a champion on Food Network’s popular culinary competition Chopped in January 2012. \n\nSource:-Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:04:56.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
