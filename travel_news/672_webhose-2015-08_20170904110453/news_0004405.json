So when I decided to go to the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse, I made it my mission to keep our readers interested. I think I came up with a shot that makes me very happy. Ponce de Leon Lighthouse Ponce-de-Leon-Lighthouse \nThe Ponce de Leon Lighthouse is more than just a lighthouse. When visiting the state’s tallest lighthouse (and the country’s 2nd tallest lighthouse) you have the opportunity to step back into history and see what life was like for the lighthouse keepers and their families. When you enter you can watch a 20 minute film about the history of the lighthouse and then peruse the grounds. You’ll see the lighthouse keepers quarters as well as the assistant lighthouse keepers house. There are maps, uniforms, and artifacts furnishing the buildings. The star attraction is being able to climb the stairs to the top of the lighthouse for a bird’s eye view of the area. Stairs up to the top of the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse Interior Ponce de Leon Lighthouse \n\nAs we walked through the buildings and got our history lesson, I kept my eye out for a good vantage point. I decided on taking my shot from the porch of the Lighthouse keeper’s main lodging. It was nice, but then Deb suggested I put the camera down and shoot up at the lighthouse. She thought it would make a great angle, but little did we know it would turn into such a spectacular shot! The lighthouse reflected in the paint on the wood as the sun went down and the handrails framed the picture perfectly. \nFor the fist time ever, I didn’t think a lighthouse was dull to shoot. As a matter a fact, the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse was one of my favourite photo sessions during our time in Florida. Ponce Inlet \nIf you are visiting the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse, I highly recommend going for sunset. Give yourself time to climb up to the top of the lighthouse and make sure to wear sturdy shoes. People wearing flip flips or heals are not allowed. \nPonce de Leon Lighthouse is located 20 minutes south of Daytona Beach on the Ponce Inlet. You can spend the afternoon in this part of Daytona and visit the Marine Science Center where they rescue sea turtles and have an emergency ICU for injured marine life. You can also catch some sun on the beach and enjoy the jetty. It’s another excellent spot for photo opportunities. See our Top 4 Motorsport Experiences including the Daytona 500.
