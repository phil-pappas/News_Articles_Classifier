On the behalf of the global tourism community, UNWTO offers its heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims and reiterates its full support to the people and the Government of Thailand.\n“These are direct attacks on the livelihood of the Thai people and their economy which is strongly linked with tourism. We stand by the Government and the people of Thailand in supporting its tourism sector as a vital pillar of the wellbeing of Thai people”, said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai.\n“Terrorism is a global threat impacting our societies, taking the lives of innocent people around the world and aiming to destroy our economies and our way of life. Thailand has a long tradition of being a hospitable and welcoming country and we fully believe it will continue to be so”, he added.\nSource: UNWTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:56:43.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
