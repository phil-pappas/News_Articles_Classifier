The race will be held at locations that have an average elevation in the vicinity of 4,200 meters, on a course passing over 100 kilometers of rugged mountain terrain. His rivals come from many countries and regions around the world.\nThe competition, entitled the \"Tour-Round-Gongga-Mountain International Outdoor Challenge Competition 2015\", is the most difficult and demanding outdoor sports event ever held in China due to the high elevation of the venue, yet it is also one surrounded by some of the world's most extraordinary and beautiful scenery.

The course has an average elevation of 4,200 meters yet slopes up and down nearly 2,000 meters. During the race, the runners will be treated to the serenity and beauty of snow-covered mountains.\n\"This is a world-class competition which has attracted many outdoor enthusiasts from all over the globe. The beautiful scenery makes it an ideal place for an open air athletic competition,\" said an outdoor sports veteran taking part in the event. Mount Gongga is the highest elevation in Sichuan province at 7,556 meters. The mountain is located in Ganzi Prefecture where the mountainous landscape provides perfect conditions for outdoor sporting events.\nFollowing the 2008 Olympics, China will host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. China's economic development has resulted in the rapid emergence of a middle class, a significant number of which are becoming outdoor sports enthusiasts.\nGanzi Prefecture will take this opportunity to build a sports and tourism venue, \"the Ganzi Mountain Tourism Destination and Oriental Outdoor Sports Paradise\", where ecologically green tourism facilities will be built and tourism and outdoor events will be held. The events will showcase local cultures while fully respecting the area's natural environment, explained the head of the Ganzi Prefecture Press Office.\n releases/tour-round-gongga-mountain-international-outdoor-challenge-competition-attracts-sports-enthusiasts-from-around-the-world-300131669.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CN82753&Transmission_Id=201508202021PR_NEWS_USPR_____CN82753&DateId=20150820", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tour-round-gongga-mountain-international-outdoor-challenge-competition-attracts-sports-enthusiasts-from-around-the-world-300131669.html"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:13:58.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
