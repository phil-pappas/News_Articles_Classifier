Cooked apple, lemon tart, buttered toast and roasted nut flavours shot through with mouth-watering acidity are a great way to start the adventure. I scored it 93 pts.\nNext, drive to Mike Weir Winery at 4041 Locust Lane in Beamsville. The famous Canadian golfer’s winery makes some very fine juice, including the lowest calorie red and white in Ontario— 2014 Vinvasa White (just 70 calories a glass) that teems with chin-drip peach, and the 2014 Vinvasa Red (80 calories a glass) with saturated black forest fruit, cocoa and red meat. Don’t miss the tightly coiled 2010 Reserve Merlot.\nFor lunch, visit Vineland Estates Winery in Vineland, Ont. and dine in the restaurant overlooking the vineyards. Try the pan-seared pickerel with chorizo, guacamole, peppernade, salsa verde and fingerlings with a glass of the 2014 St. Urban Vineyard Riesling. The off-dry, lime-rich Riesling with attractively salty finish refreshes and seasons the palate between each smoky-fresh-picante bite; greater than the sum of its parts.\nAround 3 p.m., check in to the Inn on the Twenty in Jordan Station, Ont. (rooms start at $219). Ask for a suite with a private garden or loft for optimal charm. The inn is owned by Cave Spring Winery, so drop by the on-site boutique and taste the juicy-silky 2013 Gamay ($16.95) and the luscious 2013 Riesling Icewine ($49.95) that brims with layered flavours of stone fruit, cooked apple and brown sugar.\nFor dinner, drive westward to Peninsula Ridge Estates Winery at 5600 King St. W. in Beamsville and dine on the patio of the restored Victorian manor from 1885 with magnificent views of the escarpment, vineyards and lake. The grilled beef tenderloin with shaved foie gras, red wine reduction, fondant potatoes and wilted greens pairs perfectly with the lush 2012 AJ Lepp Merlot Reserve. At $11 a glass, it is worth every penny.\nAfter a good night’s rest and breakfast at the Inn, visit Hidden Bench Vineyards and Winery at 4152 Locust Lane in Beamsville for 11a.m. Taste why this boutique winery is adored by aficionados for its super-premium wines.\nThe 2012 Chardonnay Tete de Cuvee ($45/bottle) could be mistaken for fine white Burgundy with its silky suggestions of orange oil, lemon blossom and buttered popcorn. And the 2013 Pinot Noir is all seamless finesse with tinned strawberry, violet, dried herbs and beetroot. Buy a bottle to tuck away for Thanksgiving.\nLast stop: Rosewood Estates Winery at 4352 Mountainview Rd in Beamsville, which makes award-winning wine, keeps bees and makes mead — a fermented honey drink thought to have first been made 40,000 years ago. A sip of the 2014 Mead Royale, swirling with buttered pecan, caramelized mango and lemon zest, makes a great finish to the day.\nCarolyn Evans Hammond is a Toronto-based wine writer and London-trained sommelier and author.
