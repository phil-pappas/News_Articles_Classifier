Now the ultimate place to stay in the Cotswolds, guests can enjoy one of the eight luxury suites in Thyme House, Thyme’s three cottage suites, or for the more independent traveller stay in one of the delightful cottages. \nArchitect Bob Weighton, was behind the renovation and restoration of the traditional Cotswold stone buildings at Thyme; while Interior Designer Roger Hall lovingly furnished each suite in Thyme House, handpicking an eclectic mix of English and French antique furniture from local Tetbury. Each room has its own personality, mirrored by their names, each labelled after herbs grown in the Thyme gardens with soothing properties, including ‘Lemon Balm’ and ‘Lovage’. The cottage suites are romantic and cosy, with a gorgeous living space in addition to the en-suite bedrooms. Thyme, an exemplary English country destination in the Cotswolds, has announced it is taking individual room bookings for the first time, as of 1st September 2015. For groups of friends or families, The Tallet offers four double bedrooms, an outstanding open plan living area with fully equipped kitchen, bar, dining room and private courtyard; and Old Walls is a charming cottage situated a couple of minutes’ walk away from Thyme in the village. Sleeping four adults and two children, this spacious accommodation is ideal for families and those who cannot bear to leave their pooch behind. Thyme provides a ‘home away from home’ experience for guests, blurring the line between private country house and chic boutique hotel.

Breakfast is served in the Tithe Barn, and is cooked in front of guests by expert chefs, serving fresh seasonal produce picked the same morning from the Thyme gardens and eggs from chickens, geese and quail, alongside freshly baked croissants, homemade granola and jams. Thyme is also home to The Baa, a spectacular guest drawing room and glamorous bar, an authentic medieval barn for breakfasts and privte parties; and The Swan at Southrop, a 17th century English village pub with award winning restaurant. Not to mention, a state-of-the-art cookery school, considered to be ‘the beating heart of Thyme’.
