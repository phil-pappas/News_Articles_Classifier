Zurich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Leipzig, Berlin and Hamburg were the stops where partners and distributors of Goodyear Dunlop in Germany and Switzerland were taken on a 'journey into the future'. \nThe new Goodyear UltraGrip Performance and Vector 4Seasons tyres and the Dunlop Winter Sport 5 tyres were the focal point of the programme under the slogan “Two strong brands for your future”. Approximately 100 to 120 guests per stop experienced an extremely exciting and informative evening regarding the topic “innovative products and challenges for the future”. Selected roof-top locations provided an amazing view while representing “imparting vision and perspective” for mastering future challenges. This was the setting in which trend researchers Sven Gábor Jánszky and Dr. Jörg Wallner took the guests on a journey into the year 2025. As experts, they predicted the effects of the living and working environments in the years to come and went into how the participants could maintain client relationships as well as gain new clients. An additional programme highlight were the interactive workshops, in which the newest technology was presented and offered for testing. This range extended from the Oculus Rift smart glasses to a race with the Jumping Sumo robot, current applications of augmented reality, right up to thought-controlled movement using a headset. All application scenarios, including those that were the focus of the workshops, were also tested and analysed for their significance during tyre sales. “We have comprehensively achieved our event goals with this product launch programme organised by VOK DAMS. Our distributors have given us overwhelmingly positive feedback with regard to the innovative product presentations, as well as the contributions on the future”, announced Susanne Knickel, Manager of Brand Marketing DACH from Goodyear Dunlop.
