Refreshing and easy-going, rosé is spot-on with seasonal salads, tomatoes and cold meats, perfect for a picnics, and a far lighter, more mouthwatering sundowner after a hot day than a heady cocktail. Very few rosés are worth splashing out on. The top labels of Provence, perhaps, but for a quaffing rosé, look to part with no more than £8, and probably a lot less. Most rosé is a simple pleasure – a young wine, short-lived and fairly one-dimensional – so there’s no reason why it should cost. Dry rosés are much more refreshing and food-friendly than the sweeter ones which often hail from California or Australia. The New World does makes dry rosé, but the best-value labels almost always come from Europe, especially France, Spain and Portugal. Make sure you source young rosé, never faded old vintages (this shouldn’t be a problem on the high street, though it really is in some bars and restaurants), always keep it in the fridge, for no more than a month before opening; 48 hours before finishing up. The three below are terrific value. Try these... Tagus Creek 2013/2014 Tejo, Portugal ( Asda , £4.25) A true bargain: dark pink, rich and slightly peppery, with plenty of strawberry and plum and finishing up properly dry. Chill for spicy seafood. Chiaretto 2014 Monferrato , Italy ( Marks & Spencer , £7.50 or two for £12 until 7 September) Slightly lighter than some, an elegant Italian rosato with tangy notes of raspberry and watermelon, succulent enough for aperitifs. Pizarras del Otero 2014 Bierzo, Spain ( Majestic , £9.99 or £6.66 when you buy two until 31 August) A thoroughly modern, vivacious, fruity rosado with ripe red-berry flavour delivered by the trendy mencía grape. One to pair with charcuterie. More top buys this week... Favourites this week include the well-balanced, subtle Finest Domaine de Sours Bordeaux Rose 2014 ( Tesco , £6.79) The Co-op ’s more punchy and peppery, red-cherryish Truly Irrestibile Pic Saint Loup Rosé 2013 , Languedoc (£6.99) And if you want a perfectly palatable party pink, head to Aldi for the lively Toro Loco Rosé NV , Utiel-Requena, Spain, just £3.79 TIPPLE TIP think pink... My top rosé at an independent or by mail order, for the price, is currently the fresh, gorgeously aromatic and strawberry-packed Tanners French Rosé 2014 , Côtes de Gascogne, France ( tanners-wines.co.uk , £7.50 or £6.50 if you buy six or more until 9am on 17 August). @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:39:59.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
