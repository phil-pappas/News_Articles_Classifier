The Mart is designed to attract more golfers to Thailand and underscore the Kingdom’s rapidly growing popularity as a world-class golfing destination.TAT will now be promoting the kingdom as a “Quality Leisure Destination through Thainess.” Because it fits in perfectly with that objective, golfing has been identified as one of the priority niche markets. It is also in line with the TAT’s policy to promote travel and tourism to the provinces and disseminate tourism revenue nationwide.\nFor this event, TAT has invited 153 specialist golf-holiday buyers from 27 TAT overseas offices to meet with 95 sellers at the Mart including golf courses and service providers like golf schools, equipment retailers, Thai travel agents and tour operators, hotels, spa operators and other related businesses. 43 media are also invited to explore the event.\nThailand-Golf-Travel-Mart_02-500X300\nThe Mart is an excellent opportunity for buyers and media to familiarise themselves with Thailand’s world-class golf courses, network with sellers and check out support facilities.\nThailand boasts more than 200 world-class golf courses, many of which are immaculately designed by internationally famous architects.\nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngronasa, TAT Acting Governor and Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “Golfers can enjoy their game and have a holiday at the same time. Challenging and exciting courses staffed by well-trained and courteous Thai caddies are the reasons why Thailand is such a popular choice of golf enthusiasts, especially from Japan, Korea, Europe and increasingly, India and China.\n“We also have attractive green fees that offer great value for money, excellent clubhouse facilities serving delicious Thai cuisine, as well as good challenging holes in an exotic tropical environment. Courses can be played on all year round. Furthermore, we have facilities for post-game relaxation; such as, health spas and traditional massage.”\nMany Thai golf courses and destinations are winning global awards. Pattaya and Hua Hin were voted as the Golf Destination of the Year for Asia and Australia by the IAGTO (International Association of Golf Tour Operators) in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\nSource:- TAT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:25:33.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
