We expect this number to multiply by the end of 2015. Our target for 2016 was Dh1,185 million approximately, but we will surpass this soon and we aim to surpass our 2020 target, which is Dh2.6 billion, by an additional 20 per cent.” \nDr Layla added: “Dubai is seeking to position itself within the top 15 destinations in the world for medical tourism and the first in the region. According to the Medical Tourism Destination Index (MTDI), which was published by the Medical Tourism Association in 2014, Dubai ranks 17th in the world out of 25 countries that the index comprises and accordingly the seventh in Asia and second in the Mena region among the countries surveyed by the index.” \nDr Layla also pointed out that 46 percent of the current medical tourists were from Asian countries, 25 percent from GCC and Arab countries and 13 percent from African countries while the remaining 16 percent were from other countries, mainly the UK and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Almost 44 percent of the medical tourists were in the age group of 25 to 45 and 10 percent were 65 years and above. The top health specialities availed of by the medical tourists so far were orthopaedic surgeries, dental treatments and cosmetic dermatology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:57:57.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
