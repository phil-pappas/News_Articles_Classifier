From those bases, you can explore beautiful wine regions and enjoy fantastic local produce, from both land and sea. Your dining experience begins on your Etihad Airways flight. The airline is dedicated to offering high-quality food and even has chefs on board to prepare meals. Often crew on Etihad Airways flights can offer great tips on places to visit at your destination, from sights to see to their favourite restaurants when they are in town. Here, Etihad crew members describe the in-flight dining experience and give tips on eating and drinking in Australia. • In-flight chef Jeremy McPherson shares tips for foodies in Sydney Fruits of the sea The seafood in Sydney is outstanding with everything available from Sydney Fish Market. Examples include barramundi and coral trout. John Dory is my favourite fish. As for seafood, I love balmain bugs and tiger prawns. A fine-dining favourite For fine dining I’m a bit biased towards my old head chef Peter Doyle and his restaurant Est. He taught me more than any other chef about keeping it fresh and simple. Try his signature dish: Murray cod, shaved abalone, snow peas and black fungi with ginger and green shallot vinaigrette. Then finish it all off with the passionfruit soufflé Guilty pleasures What I miss most from home are a MacIntosh’s meat pie from my local bakery in North Ryde with a delicious Farmers Union-brand iced coffee. My Mum introduced me to them when I was young and I haven’t stopped eating them since. No other country can do a pie properly! Restaurant in the sky The most popular dishes on board Etihad Airways flights for local Emiratis would be the chicken biryani and the mezze. However, for our American and European guests, the tenderloin steak is always very popular, as well as the braised lamb shank. Vine times We serve a variety of wines and champagnes on board our flights. The chefs are given tasting notes on the wines and are trained in pairing these with the dishes on the à la carte menu. • In-flight chef Matthew Barratt describes the in-flight dining experience How many different food options are served on board? We have a huge choice: three main-course options in Economy Class, and four in Business Class, where our food and beverage managers can guide you through your choices. In First Class, our in-flight chefs have a fully stocked larder of different meats, sauces, vegetables and many other ingredients so they can tailor-make dishes or even create full degustation menus to a guest’s preference. From our revolutionary grill menu and extensive list of entrees, guests can pick dishes and create a personalised dining experience. In The Residence by Etihad they can request a customised menu in advance or choose from the menu designed exclusively for The Residence. What are the most popular dishes? Our Arabic mezze and biryani offerings are very popular, as are dishes such as pan-fried barramundi and zaalouk- crusted chicken breast, Which wines do you serve? How are they chosen? We offer an array of new world and old world wines and always have a boutique wine available. Our teams in the premium cabins are trained to recommend wines to go with guests’ menu choices. Our cabin managers and in-flight chefs also go through sommelier training at the Etihad Training Academy. Where do you like to go for dinner in Australia? Any of Brent Savage’s restaurants are always a hit! He joined us in Abu Dhabi for a caviar dinner a few years ago to great success. Alternatively, I would go to the Sydney Fish Market at Darling Harbour and choose some fresh fish to be cooked to order. Do you have a favourite bar? What’s so great about it? In Melbourne the Cookie Beer Hall is a fantastic micro-brewery bar where they pair the beers with Thai-influenced dishes. It is a phenomenal experience. Where do you go for the best brew in town? I am a tea lover so I usually try to get hold of some Dilmah tea and try out the different biscuits or \"biccys\" as locals call them. It also goes well with a beautiful local Lamington Cake. Discover Australia with Etihad Airways, voted the World’s Leading Airline at the World Travel Awards.
