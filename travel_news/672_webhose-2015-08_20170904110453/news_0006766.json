Paul Schemm, Associated Press Summary \nThe jet skis roar by the shore and the water is full of splashing children along the Tunisian Riviera, where despite the deadly attack that killed 38 tourists in June, the beaches are still full — for now. \nHAMMAMET, Tunisia — The jet skis roar by the shore and the water is full of splashing children along the Tunisian Riviera, where despite the deadly attack that killed 38 tourists in June, the beaches are still full — for now. \nEuropeans have abandoned this North African country, leaving just local Tunisian beach-goers and visiting Algerians. But they will be gone by month's end, and then the real pain for the country's all-important tourism industry will begin. \nAttracted by deep price cuts, Tunisians have flocked to the beaches for their summer vacations, but reservation books are empty for the fall as the school year starts. \n\"We are full for the next three weeks and then we will be empty,\" said Abdelhamid Zaraga, owner of the Atrium Hotel in Hammamet, as he sat in the cavernous hotel lobby bustling with Tunisians in beach gear. \"We've been full since three days ago because we dropped our pants to be cheaper than our neighbors.\" \nWhile tourism officially only makes up 7 percent of Tunisia's economy, industry experts estimate its real contribution is closer to 19 percent. And the decision by Britain and some other European countries to warn away their travelers has devastated the sector. The travel guidance was prompted by security concerns after the June attack and another deadly attack in March on the country's leading museum, both by Islamic extremists. \nZouhair Mbarek, owner of Batouta Voyages travel agency in Tunis, said no amount of price cutting or other promotions was having any impact in attracting budget-conscious foreigners back to Tunisia — at least in the foreseeable future. \n\"In the current situation, the issue is not price,\" he said. \"The issue is whether people feel safe enough to come to Tunisia.\" \nTunisia depends on tourism to earn hard currency and its revenue covers 60 percent of its commercial debt payments, according to Radhouane Bensalah, the president of the hotel association and the owner of the Saphir Palace in Hammamet. \nHe said the government is scrambling to save the industry as hotels around the country close up, and has said that loans, taxes and utility payments for hotels will all be delayed until the situation improves. \nThe government is also working with hotels that are temporarily closing to pay at least partial salaries to their employees, to avoid the devastating consequences of laying off large sections of the workforce in a country already ravaged by 15 percent unemployment. \nSome 400,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in the industry and they support 2 million family members — no small number in a country of just 11 million. \nSince Tunisia's 2011 revolution, which inspired democracy advocates around the world but scared away many tourists, the whole sector has been struggling, and the national economy along with it. The two deadly attacks this year came just as hopes for an economic turnaround were emerging at last. GDP growth for the year is now expected to sink to 1 percent. \nOn a bright August morning in Hammamet, however, the beaches were filling up and the sidewalks choked with cars bearing Algerian license plates. \n\"We decided to come to help the Tunisians,\" said Rafiqa Mishri, an Algerian woman with oversize sunglasses and a headscarf walking along the beach with her husband. \"We have experience with terrorism, we aren't afraid.\" \nThe seasonal influx of Algerians to Tunisian beaches has been hailed in the media as an example of neighborly support. But the 4,000 people crossing the borders every day are typical for this time of year. \nNearby, tour guide Abdessalam Trabelsi tries to interest people in rides on camels, quad bikes or even a pirate ship. He admits it's good to have the Algerians, but says they don't make up for the absence of Europeans.
