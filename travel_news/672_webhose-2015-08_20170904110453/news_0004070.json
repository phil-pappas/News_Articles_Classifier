The report is likely to trigger fresh concerns over marking as a rise in appeals is expected this summer. But OCR said teachers and students “can feel confident about this summer all A Level marking has been completed and the quality of marking has been upheld.” The Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR) was the subject of an investigation by the exam regulator, Ofqual, last year after the exam board experienced a delay in marking because of IT problems. A new Ofqual report that followed the investigation into marking issues at OCR last summer also said it was not prosecuting the exam board because in the end it delivered the exam results on time. \"It is clear from Ofqual’s thorough report that OCR came dangerously close to falling short in this instance.\" Schools Minister Nick Gibb OCR has acknowledged marking didn’t go “as smoothly” as it would have wished for but that it delivered the results on time. The report said: “OCR demonstrated a lack of understanding of the critical role that the data from exam boards plays in the very early days of allocating university places. “It appears that only after the joint meeting between OCR, Ofqual and Ucas on 31st July did OCR senior managers understand fully the significant effect that an anticipated shortfall of marked A Level papers would have on a significant percentage of students going into clearing.” Concerns have been raised over OCR's marking and the potential delays students could have faced for their results last summer Photo: Alamy An OCR spokesman said: “Last summer’s marking did not go as smoothly as OCR would have wanted. We welcome the regulator’s report as it confirms we delivered the results on time, took the right steps to improve our system resilience and that Ofqual did not need to take any regulatory action. OCR met the Ucas deadline - seven days before Results day itself - despite having nearly a million extra scripts to mark electronically. “Although we delivered the results on time, as soon as possible after the actual Results day we launched a voluntary ‘warts and all’ investigation. We then appointed an experienced, senior team whose job was to ensure we learnt the lessons of the summer and took the right action to make our processes more robust.” \"Ofqual’s report will come as an assurance to students who are set to receive their A Level and GCSE results...but the timing of its release seems ill-judged.\" Kevin Courtney, Deputy General Secretary of the NUT Malcolm Trobe, Deputy General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is good to see that Ofqual has carried out a thorough review of the problems that OCR experienced in 2014. We were also very pleased that, in the event, OCR responded quickly in 2014 to ensure that all results did come out in time. It is also important to emphasise that there have been no issues identified with this year’s exams. “Students absolutely must receive their results at the right time so that those sitting A levels are able to take up university offers and those taking GCSEs are able to progress to A levels and other post-16 courses.” More reaction Schools Minister Nick Gibb : “Exam boards owe it to pupils to make sure their hard work in exams is marked accurately and on time. It is clear from Ofqual’s thorough report that OCR came dangerously close to falling short in this instance. I am pleased OCR has taken steps to address the failures from last year and that all exam papers are on course to be marked in time. Peter Hamilton, Chair of HMC's Academic Policy Sub Committee and Headmaster of Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School: \"HMC has been concerned about poor exam marking for some years and has worked closely with Ofqual to ensure all pupils, parents and teachers can have complete faith in public examinations. We welcome this report but are disturbed to see laid bare the chaotic way in which marking was conducted at OCR in 2014. \"Marking will become more demanding over the next four years as the government's exam reforms start to bite.\" Kevin Courtney, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers: “The NUT welcomes the fact that both OCR and the Regulator had systems in place to identify and address difficulties as they arose. Ofqual’s report will come as an assurance to students who are set to receive their A Level and GCSE results in the next few days, but the timing of its release seems ill-judged. \"It is in the interests of students and their schools for marking to be consistent, high quality and as accurate as possible. We hope that this will be demonstrated in the coming days.\" @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:40:29.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
