Grand Circle Cruise Line will offer 3595 single cabins for 2016 vs. 2973 in 2015—an increase of 622 cabins, or 21 percent. Overall, Grand Circle has increased its single cabin inventory by 133% in the past five years (1542 single cabins in 2010) to meet increased interest in solo travel among older Americans. Today, 88% of solo travelers are women—up from 80% in 2014.\n“More travelers are reserving with us as solos, regardless of marital status,” said Dowd. “While most want their own cabins, they still want excellent value. By increasing our solo cabin inventory and offering a range of other solo-friendly options, we are committed to making river and small ship cruising an affordable, easy, and highly enjoyable way for solo travelers to see the world. Even with increased inventory, though, space is limited, so we encourage solo travelers to reserve their cabins soon.”\nIn 2015 YTD, 33%, of all Grand Circle Cruise Line travelers have booked as solos—up from 30% in 2014 and 24% in 2010. Grand Circle believes that one reason for the increase is its comprehensive Solo-Friendly Program, which includes free or reduced Single Supplements on all river and small ship cruises, free Single Supplements on all pre-and-post trip extensions, a free Roommate Matching program, a free online Travel Companion program, a Solo Traveler Challenge, and more. Grand Circle Cruise Line’s per diem costs are typically $50-$500 lower than those of other small ship cruise lines, while its Solo Traveler Challenge will match a lower price and deduct an additional $500 off a Grand Circle cruise vacation should a solo traveler find a lower price for a comparable cruise.\nWith a passenger capacity range of just 46 to 146 passengers, Grand Circle’s fleet encourages a spirit of camaraderie and friendship onboard that doesn’t exist on larger cruise ships, where solo travelers may disappear in the crowds. Training of all Grand Circle Program Directors (guides) and ship crew around solo traveler concerns ensures that those traveling solo are integrated into a group from the onset, having companions to dine with during meal times, for example, or friends with whom to explore local ports during free time, if one so desires.\nAlthough Grand Circle has added additional single cabins to its 2016 inventory, single cabins are still limited and tend to fill quickly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:22:39.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
