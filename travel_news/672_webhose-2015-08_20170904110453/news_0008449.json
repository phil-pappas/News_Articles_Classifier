Explore nature, in its wholesome and natural state. Unspoiled and quiet, take time with friends and family to visit Joshua Tree National Park. Joshua Tree National Park covers over 800,000 acres, and has many campgrounds to choose from. There are two distinct ecosystems that converge at Joshua Tree National Park. Below 3,000 feet in elevation, is the lower desert. Part of The Sonoran Desert, this eastern half of the park has the pungent smell of the ever present creosote bush. Cholla cactus and spidery ocotillo grow sporadically across this vast desert. Slightly higher in elevation, is the high desert area of Joshua Tree National Park. The high desert can be a bit cooler, and is in the Mojave Desert. The high desert is the perfect elevation for the statuesque Joshua Trees. Legend has it that Mormon pioneers crossing the desert thought the arms of the Joshua Tree were like the outstretched arms of Joshua, which would lead these pioneers to the promised land. When visiting Joshua Tree National Park campgrounds, come prepared with all of the necessary items you will need. This is a ‘dry camping’ area. Water is provided only by spigots at the edge of some of the campgrounds. Bring water with you! There are eight campgrounds that vary in elevation from 3,000 feet to 4,500 feet. For summer camping, Russ and Lori prefer either Jumbo Rocks campground or Sheep Pass campground in the summer. At about 4,500 feet in elevation, is can be very pleasant during the day and a comfortable cool during the evenings. All campgrounds are on a first come first served basis. With 124 available camping sites, Jumbo Rocks is a best bet. A maximum of six people, three tents, and two vehicles are allowed to occupy an individual campsite. A vehicle towing a trailer or a motorhome towing a vehicle is considered two vehicles. Some sites are smaller, only large enough for one vehicle. Daily rates for all campgrounds range from $15-$20 a night. Pets are welcomed but must be on a leash at all times. For group camping, reservations are taken at Cottonwood, Indian Cove, and Sheep Pass campgrounds. Group sites can have from 10-60 people. Group site reservations can be made up to one year in advance. You can hike for miles, but come prepared! Some cell phone service is spotty. Ensure that you do not hike alone, carry water, and stay on designated trails. Joshua Tree National Park is also known for its beautiful and grand rock formations. Some, hundreds of feet high, rock climbing at its best can be found here. Another point of interest is Keys Ranch. In the early days of mining, ranching, and homesteading, some tried this desert as a place to make their home and living. Bill and Francis Keys spent 60 years in the desert, raising their five children and making the best of the desert environment. Their house, store, school house, and workshop still stand. Their orchard is still productive. Guided walking tours are available, are approximately one half mile in length, and take about 90 minutes. The cost is $10 for adults and $5 for children 6 to 11. Bring good walking shoes, a hat, sunscreen, and LOTS of water. Be prepared for ever changing weather conditions there. Leave your electronic devices at home. Use cell phones for emergencies only. Get back in concert with our planet that works quite well without batteries. Be amazed at the natural twisted rock and granite monoliths. Look in awe at the evening sky. Enjoy the extreme beauty and wonder of this land. Visit Joshua Tree National Park, and Let’s Get Rollin’!
