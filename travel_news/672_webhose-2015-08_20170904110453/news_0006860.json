Bill Reese of the Idaho State Police. “The North American Inspectors Championship tests and educates inspectors, providing a well-rounded educational opportunity along with the healthy competitive spirit that has guided and made this competition successful and a goal for top aspiring inspectors for the past 23 years.”\nRoadside inspectors are highly trained professionals who save lives every day by keeping unsafe commercial vehicles and drivers off our roads. The work of a commercial vehicle inspector is not easy, but it is vital in ensuring public safety on North American roadways. The North American Inspectors Championship was created to recognize inspectors and officers – the backbone of the commercial vehicle safety program in North America – and to promote uniformity of inspections through education.\n“Commercial vehicle inspectors are skilled professionals who are dedicated to help protect the motoring public by conducting more than three million unannounced inspections each year and removing unsafe trucks, buses and commercial drivers from the road,” said Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Chief Counsel Scott Darling. “While we honor the participants of the North American Inspectors Championship who competed this week, we also recognize and salute the thousands of roadside inspectors working everyday with the goal of ensuring that every traveler reaches his or her destination safety.”\nNAIC is sponsored by CVSA and many of its valued associate members. For the past 23 years, the championship event has been held in partnership with the American Trucking Associations’ (ATA) National Truck Driving Championships (NTDC). NAIC has been recognized by the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE) as an event that \"Advances America.\"\nTo learn more about NAIC and to view photos from this year’s Championship, visit http://www.cvsa.org/programs/naic_program_overview .", "external_links": ["http://www.cvsa.org/programs/naic_program_overview", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5jdnNhLm9yZy9wcm9ncmFtcy9uYWljX3Byb2dyYW1fb3ZlcnZpZXc="], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:23:23.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
