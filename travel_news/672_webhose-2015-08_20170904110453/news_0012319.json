More than 24.1 million gallons of extra fuel is consumed every year and the average commuter burns 21 gallons of fuel a year in congestion, according to the Annual Urban Mobility Scorecard released Wednesday by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute . Pittsburghers spent an average 39 hours a year in traffic jams, which ranks No. 51 in the U.S. The extra fuel costs the average commuter $889 in the Pittsburgh region, according to the report. Congestion and costs have gone up in 95 of the top 100 metros, including Pittsburgh. The most congested? Washington, D.C., where commuters spend an extra 63 hours of their lives per year and it costs $1,433 per commuter. Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Boston round out the top five. \"In 2014, congestion caused urban Americans to travel an extra 6.9 billion hours and purchase an extra 3.1 billion gallons of fuel for a congestion cost of $160 billion. Trucks account for $28 billion (17 percent) of that cost, much more than their 7 percent of traffic,\" according to the study. But the Pittsburgh metro area’s commuter stress index and its average time traveled aren’t as high as other parts of the country. The region’s travel time ranked 42 out of 400-plus markets and the cost per commuter was 59th. For more details about Pittsburgh and other parts of western Pennsylvania — including the metro regions in Maryland, Ohio and West Virginia that touch southwestern Pennsylvania — are also included, via the study. \nGet Pittsburgh Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:08:26.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
