Plus, walking in a zoological park is highly likely to beat the hotel treadmill.\nWhat’s new at the zoo? Here’s a look at some zoo babies. And talk about German engineering: For zoo baby photos, German zoos seem to dominate on the cuteness scale; we’ve selected four of them.\nOf course, there are pros and cons related to the very existence of zoos. Among the resources offering food for thought are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ concerns about a captive’s quality of life ( peta.org ; search for zoo) and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Saving Animals from Extinction program ( aza.org/safe ).\nTo see more photos, search for “baby zoo animals” on Pinterest. Bet you can’t scroll through more than a few before you’re oohing and aahing and possibly even involuntarily squealing from cuteness overload.\nFor the oxidental tourist\nWait: A young musk ox in Cologne? See what we did there — making a connection between musk and Cologne, two words related to the olfactory sense? Anyone? Anyway, this one at the zoo in Cologne, Germany, had its glamour shot taken in mid-July. Two musk ox babies were born in mid-May. It’s hard to imagine one of these sweet little creatures growing into an 800-pound adult with a shaggy coat and curved horns. The babies are a musk-see on the zoo visitor’s agenda. koelnerzoo.de\nYou’ll never forget a baby elephant\nThis female elephant at Hagenbeck Animal Park in Hamburg, Germany, was born shortly before this photo was taken July 13. This mother and baby evoke Disney’s animated Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo, but we in the peanut gallery are fond of these, too. Hagenbeck has a long history; the zoo’s animal collection began in 1863. hagenbeck.de\nHow much is that tiger in the window? Sorry, kid. This particular cat, which seems to be wondering whether you are friend or food, is not for sale. Siberian tiger twins were born at the zoo of Olomouc, Czech Republic, which works with endangered species, in May. The babies debuted to visitors on June 30. This one seems to be playing peekaboo, but as young visitors soon learn, zoo animals are not for cuddling. For that, please exit through the gift shop and buy the plush-toy version. zoo-olomouc.cz\nHey, look what the stork brought! This baby flamingo at the Abilene Zoo nestles so close to an adult that you can’t see it very well, but the babies are white or gray when they hatch. Livescience.com feeds zoo-baby nerds a fact: Flamingos get their pink color from their diets, which are rich in beta carotene. To get a good look at a baby flamingo, see the video from 2012 celebrating the Abilene Zoo’s first flamingo baby: youtube.com/watch?v=\n2W9vZihc7ms. This sweet pair was photographed in mid-July. Abilene Zoo, 2070 Zoo Lane, Abilene; open daily. abilenezoo.org .\nSpeed demons\nYou can’t beat a cheetah when there’s a need for speed. In June, two cheetah babies practice sprinting as they explore their outdoor enclosure at the zoo in Rostock, Germany. If you want to watch them in action and hear the little squeaks these fearsome predators-in-training make before they can roar, check out videos on the Web, including the one at youtube.com/watch?v=Al_0o7xTSEc. zoo-rostock.de\nDrill baby, drill! With his jug ears and star quality, a baby drill, which Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich describes as one of Africa’s most endangered monkey species, charms visitors. Pinto was born June 24; he’s the third baby of 10-year-old Kaduna. This photo was taken July 22, illustrating that drills share at least one thing with human babies: They grow up so fast. At the zoo’s website, hellabrunn.de, you can find a list of the zoo’s notable births in recent months.\nOn Twitter:\n @MSheridanMartha", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al_0o7xTSEc", "http://aza.org/safe", "https://twitter.com/MSheridanMartha"], "published": "2015-08-15T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T01:31:02.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
