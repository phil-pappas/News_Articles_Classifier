The airline announced separately that relatives of the 239 passengers and crew had been notified. The announcement came as experts assembled near Toulouse, France, to begin analysis on the Boeing 777 wing component, called a flaperon. It's the first confirmed piece of wreckage from the aircraft, and though it confirms the plane's fate, it sheds little light on what caused the crash. \"We expect and hope that there would be more objects to be found which would be able to help resolve this mystery,\" says the airline.
