The minister was speaking at the 31st annual convention of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) being held in Indore, Madhya Pradesh (MP). The theme of the three-day convention is “Tourism: We will change the Indian economy.” \nHe told the 1,260 delegates that the government will meet the aspirations of the industry. Similar sentiments were expressed by the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Shivraj singh Chouhan, who said that MP has many attractions for domestic and international tourists. \nSharma pointed out that there was no reason why India should not get more tourists, when Singapore and Maldives were doing so well. \nThe Minister said that the Finance Minister has been approached to reduce the tax burden and provide infrastructure status to tourism. \nMP’s Chief Minister appealed to the center to have direct flights to places in his state from Sri Lanka so that Buddhist traffic can be tapped. He said that during the famed Kumbh fair next year in Ujjain, the Indian message of world peace and understanding will be conveyed to the world. \nIndia has recently opened an e-visa facility for Chinese tourists. IATO President Subhash Goyal said that the e-visa facility should be for multi-entry and for 60 days, as India gets visitors who want to see the region. \nConvention Chairman P. Sarkar said the agents will promote MP at ITB and World Travel Market (WTM). \nA. Lohani, Commissioner of Tourism for MP, listed the steps to promote the state. Lohani has been named CMD of Air India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:38:03.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
