The local spices and Creole touch, all add to what makes the Seychelles’ cuisine unique by a thousand miles. \nThere are many chefs in Seychelles who have dedicated their time and develop passion for the local cuisine, taking it to new heights. \nDiolan Barra, is one of those chefs who have excelled in bringing our local cuisine to becoming one of the most-talked about by our visitors. \nMr Barra is a chef working at the Cerf Island Resort for the last nine years, soon to clock a decade at the establishment located on the coast of this enchanted island lying in the Sainte Anne marine park. \nHaving spent 30 years in the tourism industry, is a feat achieved by this talented chef, who is always eager to learn and be more creative in the kitchen. \nClocking so many years, is not an easy thing but it takes perseverance, dedication and most of all one must love the job. \n“I am happy to help bring the pillar of our economy to another level. I have been in this industry for so many years and I have witness how it has grown,” he said. \n“Cooking is my passion and I want to be a role model for the young ones who are the future of this industry.” \nOne thing which amazes everyone is that for almost a decade Mr Barra has been travelling from Mahe to Cerf island on a daily basis, rough or calm seas, he has always been ready for his work. A main concern on the island is being able to retain employees but Mr Barra has been devoted to his job that crossing from one island to another has never been a problem. \nMr Barra is a one-of-a-kind chef. He does not only prepare his dishes and serves to his clients, but the way he welcomes and bonds with his clients, is amazing. \nHe shares tips and recipes to his clients who often want to know how to prepare some of the dishes he serves, but like all chefs, not all secrets are revealed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:50:23.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
