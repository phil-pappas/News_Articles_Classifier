Thomas A. Dickerson | Aug 13, 2015 Hon. Thomas A. Dickerson Banners   \nPlanning a vacation? Please consider, among other things, your planned destination and the incidence of criminal activity and terrorist acts in the local environment as well as the nature and type of accidents which tourists have previously sustained running the spectrum from wrongful death to slip, trips and falls. This is the third year that we have posted dangerous destination information collected from news articles and reported law cases. \nAs noted in Tourism: 49 percent of the health problems when traveling related to the destination, eturbonews.com (6/25/2015) “Observatory (TIO) with the support of the World Tourism Organization 49 percent of the health problems affecting tourists and travelers when they visit other countries are related to the county of destination, such as gastrointestinal or respiratory infections. 26 percent of the problems faced by travelers have to do with trauma, especially fractures”. \nThe information in the treatise is categorized by region, types of accidents and by country and includes some discussions about liability theories, personal jurisdiction, forum non conveniens and choice of law. Included in these misadventures is a section on Behaving Yourself while abroad and being arrested for failing to respect local customs and traditions. \nTHE CARIBBEAN \nThe Caribbean is a very popular destination for United States citizens and others arriving by cruise ship or aircraft. There are many tourist accidents in the Caribbean some of which involve criminal activity. Robberies and assaults are quite common in the Caribbean have taken place in the Bahamas, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and St. Thomas. Tourists are well advised not to rely on foreign clinics and medical professionals when a physical injury occurs. The best course of action for an injured tourist is to return to the U.S. as fast as possible for medical care. Medical malpractice and the contraction of disease has taken place in the Bahamas, Barbados, Dominican Republic, Netherlands Antilles and Puerto Rico. \nCENTRAL & SOUTH AMERICA & CANADA \nDestinations in Central and South America generate accidents similar to those in the Caribbean. Mexico, in particular, has invested extraordinary sums in developing many beach destinations on both coasts and as a result has the highest number of travel accidents in this region. \nAFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, ASIA & THE PACIFIC \nAfrica, Asia, The Middle East and the Pacific nations are attracting ever greater numbers of tourists while at the same time attracting terrorists, pirates and very scary diseases like Ebola. \nARCTIC, ANTARCTIC, EUROPE, RUSSIA & CENTRAL ASIA \nFrom frozen waste lands to old and traditional venues travel accidents occur here as well. \nBEHAVE YOURSELF \nTravelers not only need to be careful and protect themselves but they need to behave in accordance with the laws and customs of the destination country. For example, “In Singapore, which places a high value on order, prostitution is legal but careless disposal of chewing gum can invoke fines up to $500...Jaywalking and spitting result in similar fines. On the bright side, Singapore saves canings for more serious offenses, such as vandalism, for which American teenager Michael Fay received a public lashing in 1994. Sensitivity to another country’s values (is important as) Raffi Nernekian, a Lebanese tourist visiting the United Arab Emirates learned...when he was arrested for wearing a skin cancer awareness T-shirt depicting Posh Spice in her birthday suit. Though a strategic pose and lettering kept Mrs. Beckham’s revelations from being explicit, Nerekian spent a month in jail...(and) Ireland, the land of creative invective, just passed a blasphemy law making it 1 25,000-euro ($37,000) offense to say or print anything ‘grossly abusive or insulting’ about any subject held sacred by any religion”(Dougherty, The Informer, Lost in Translation, Conde Nast Traveler, p. 76).
