But instead of adding stale bread, we lightly toast cubes of sourdough in the oven. This is a salad for the height of summer and is only as good as the tomatoes you use. Colourful, heritage varieties, full of flavour, to look out for include Green Zebra, Tigerella and Purple Russian. SERVES 6 INGREDIENTS 2 thick slices sourdough bread, cubed (about 2cm) about 8 good, flavoursome tomatoes 1 cucumber 1 medium red onion, finely sliced 1 large red pepper, deseeded and chopped 3 cloves of garlic, crushed 1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves torn 1 small bunch fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil 2 tbsp red-wine vinegar METHOD Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Scatter the cubes of bread over a large baking tray in a single layer. Bake in the oven for 7-8 minutes until dry and only lightly coloured, then leave to cool. Cut each tomato into eight and put into a large bowl. Cut the cucumber lengthways in half. Scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon and chop (about 1.5cm). Add to the tomatoes, along with the red onion and red pepper. Scatter the toasted bread on top and add the garlic, basil and parsley. Season and toss lightly. Mix three tablespoons of the oil with the vinegar, pour over the salad and toss well. Tip gently into a serving dish and drizzle with the remaining oil. Leave at room temperature for about 20 minutes before serving to let all the flavours develop and soak into the bread.
