It was in the city of Hyfa that Minister St.Ange was taken on the state of Israel's new Rib Boat that is fully equipped for search and rescue among others. The exercise that took place in open waters showed the maneuvers used for rescue purposes and the ability of the Israeli police in detecting ships as they enter its ports. \nThe Seychelles are islands conceived with sailors in mind, and the ability for appreciating the latest safety models was interesting for the visiting tourism minister. From speeding to reach cargo ships to maneuvering docking a smaller Rib at sea, all exercises were undertaken as the Israeli Police showed their latest radar equipment able to detect a man overboard without any difficulty. \"We are an island nation, and how best to be prepared is always interesting,\" said Minister St.Ange, who said that he felt privileged to have been invited on these ultra-modern boats imported to Israel from Seattle in the USA. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
