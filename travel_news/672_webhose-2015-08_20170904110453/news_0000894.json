He was the first in line two hours before the doors opened just after 10 a.m.\nDozens of people line up outside the Silver State Relief medical marijuana dispensary in Sparks, Nev., Friday, July 31, 2015, to be among the first in Nevada to legally purchase medicinal pot.

Everything is labeled, and the people are knowledgeable and very helpful.\"\nUnless the next Legislature takes action sooner, Nevadans will consider another ballot measure in 2016 to legalize recreational use of marijuana.\nThey approved medical pot in 2000, but the law lacked language to establish a system to sell or distribute the drug until 2013. Before that, anyone authorized had to grow their own — up to 12 plants per person — or find it some other way.\nA man walks past the Silver State Relief medical marijuana dispensary in Sparks, Nev., Friday, July 31, 2015, just after it became the first in the state to start selling medical pot legally.

Tick Segerblom, a major proponent of marijuana legislation. \"Why the Legislature could not get behind this blows my mind.\"\nNevada is among 23 states that allow medical marijuana, along with Washington, D.C., and Guam.\nOn average it takes nine to 18 months for stores to open following legislative approval, said Karmen Hanson, marijuana analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nDana Metz, 64, of Sparks, Nev., was at the head of the line at the window to be among the first in Nevada on Friday July 31, 2015, to legally purchase medical marijuana at the Silver State Relief dispensary in Sparks, Nev.

The state deferred to the county's list, but the future of the state-approved entities is uncertain.\nNevada Medical Marijuana Association Executive Director Will Adler said the state's strict rules — based on Colorado's system — will stave off problems once dispensaries get off the ground and become a model for other states.\n\"We tried to write the law that would be the gold standard for the country,\" he said.\nNevada's regulations include \"seed-to-sale\" tracking to trace marijuana to the source — a measure aimed at preventing black market marijuana from seeping into the system, or thieves from taking pot out. The Department of Agriculture also is working to finalize a pesticide testing process that screens for 30 to 40 different chemicals, the first such system in the nation.\nSilver State Relief General Manager Aron Swan said Sparks officials were supportive from the beginning.\nOne thing the city did right was to pick dispensary locations in industrial areas, he said.\n\"There are no homes around here, no churches or parks,\" Swan said. \"We've had zero pushback.\"\nSwan noted cardholders who come to Silver State Relief are not stereotypical stoners but normal people who use pot as medicine. He cited a young veteran with PSTD who told him marijuana is the only thing that gets him through the day.\n\"It gets me choked up, a little teary-eyed, and proud to be a part of this,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/31/ca/e9/ef15442e759c42b981fc78ce036d3279-ee09eecbf8b24069a05e15a3ee0d670e-0.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/31/e7/bc/ef15442e759c42b981fc78ce036d3279-ee09eecbf8b24069a05e15a3ee0d670e-3.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/31/4b/11/ef15442e759c42b981fc78ce036d3279-ee09eecbf8b24069a05e15a3ee0d670e-1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/07/31/bf/fd/ef15442e759c42b981fc78ce036d3279-ee09eecbf8b24069a05e15a3ee0d670e-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-07-31T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:12:56.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
