He said that as the man passed, he tossed his briefcase in front of him, and \"tripped him up.\"\nKrezwick said the man got down on the ground when a Customs and Border Protection agent pointed a gun at him.\nJoe Manzelli, who was waiting to pick up his wife near a security checkpoint at the airport, said he heard someone yelling, \"Stop!\" and then saw a man running into the terminal. He said he could see several bags dropped in the exit and then a group of police officers racing into the terminal. About five minutes later, authorities began to evacuate the area, he said.\nManzelli said he saw the man led back to the screening area, where he was \"just rambling about being afraid of being shot and money.\"\nPentangelo said the man appeared to not understand why he was being detained and \"seemed agitated\" when officers took him into custody.\nThe encounter caused a portion of the airport to be evacuated while officers with police dogs conducted a security sweep. Passengers were allowed back inside around 9:30 p.m.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:44:41.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
