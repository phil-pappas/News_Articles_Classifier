It was also two per cent higher than the number of visitors during June 2010, previously Yellowstone's busiest month. \nOverall, total numbers for the year so far were up 17 per cent compared with the first seven months of 2014, with 2,279,557 people visiting Yellowstone through the end of July. \nIf the trend continues, 2015 could be its busiest ever year, topping 2010, when more than 3.6 million people visited. \nYellowstone spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said parking lots are fuller than usual, and lines for bathrooms longer. \n“We're still trying to look at how the numbers are truly affecting the visitor experience,” Bartlett said. \nYellowstone can accommodate fewer than 15,000 overnight visitors in hotels, cabins and campgrounds inside the park's 8,900 square km. A busy day can bring more than 30,000 visitors, so thousands sleep each night in gateway communities in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. \nIn Cody, Wyoming, July brought increased crowds for hotels, restaurants and attractions, said Sheila Lucas of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce. \nLucas said this summer also brought more Asian visitors, continuing a trend seen over the past few years. \nPark managers are working to improve safety education for visitors after five people were injured this summer approaching bison, including tourists trying to take selfies with the large but unpredictable animals. \nA Montana man who worked in the park was killed by a grizzly bear earlier this month while hiking alone. \nA federal budget proposal released in February called for an additional US$433 million (RM1.77 billion) for the Park Service in 2016, which marks the agency's centennial. Much of the increase would go to repair infrastructure at parks nationwide. \nFollowing automatic spending cuts that began in 2013, Yellowstone's budget has been trimmed by roughly 10 per cent. \nIt could see an extra US$3 million next year after hiking entrance fees and ending a shared admission programme with neighbouring Grand Teton National Park. — Reuters More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T06:38:44.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
