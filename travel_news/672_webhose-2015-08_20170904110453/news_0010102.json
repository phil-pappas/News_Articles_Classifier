Sign In Here North Texas-based American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are slightly outpacing their competitors in job growth as a merger for American and the lifting of flight restrictions for Southwest translates into jobs. Fort Worth-based American (Nasdaq: AAL) employed 90,721 full-time workers and 11,950 part-timers in the United States in June, for a total of 102,671, up 6 percent from a year ago. Southwest (NYSE: LUV) employment rose 5 percent to 46,808 full-timers and 1,674 part-timers, totaling 48,482 nationwide. Among other major carriers, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) rose 4 percent to 84,728 total U.S. employees, and Chicago-based United Airlines (NYSE: UAL) dropped 2 percent to 84,059 employees. The job numbers for American Airlines include the 35,339 total employees that the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics still tracks as employees of US Airways . That airline and American merged in 2013, creating a mega-airline with more passengers than any other in the world, but they have so far reported job numbers separately, BTS spokesman Dave Smallen said. June was the last month for which there will be separate reports, he said. The employment gains come at a time of relative prosperity for the airlines but also as Southwest and some other carriers are dealing with labor problems. Federal investigators, meanwhile, are probing whether the country’s largest airlines violated competition rules, and shareholders’ concerns of a stall in the market have stock prices in descent. American posted a record profit of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015 and Southwest also set a record, with net income of $608 million. Southwest and American in July also broke their all-time records for traffic. Overall, U.S. passenger airlines employed 3 percent more workers in June 2015 than in June 2014, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported. June was the 19th consecutive month that full-time equivalent employment for U.S. passenger airlines exceeded the same month of the previous year and was the highest monthly total since September 2008. Month-to-month, the number of FTEs rose 0.3 percent nationwide from May to June, the sixth consecutive monthly increase. Averaged out, American, Delta, Southwest and United airlines, which collectively employ two-thirds of airline workers, reported 3.1 percent more FTEs in June 2015 than in June 2014 and the airlines’ FTEs rose 0.4 percent from May to June, rising for the ninth consecutive month. \nGet Dallas Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:27:43.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
