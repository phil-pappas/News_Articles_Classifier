Interactive whiteboards that allow presenters to wirelessly connect via iOS and Android devices, and space-saving disappearing projector screens and data projectors are among the new highlights of the hotel's six meeting rooms. These venues are also equipped with a wall-mounted touch-screen control panel for lighting, sound and visuals, and they all sport a contemporary sleek interior design. New conference menus have also been developed to allow for broader dietary requirements and dining preferences during events. The hotel has observed a rise in breakfast meetings, for instance. The upgrade of InterContinental Wellington's conference floor was the final stage of a two-year refurbishment project that brought sweeping changes to the property's Club InterContinental Lounge, club rooms, Chameleon Restaurant, The Lobby Lounge and the reception area. It also carved out a new Deluxe Guest Room category.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:59:36.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
