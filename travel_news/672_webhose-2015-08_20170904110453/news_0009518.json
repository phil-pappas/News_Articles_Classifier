I must have been seven and I can still remember the excitement as I climbed aboard.\nMost memorable holiday?\nMemorabe for the wrong reasons. We spent a week in Llandudno and it rained every day.\nNever have we appreciated bus shelters more.\nAny particular travel-related anecdote which stands out?\nThe time I accompanied the Archbishop of Canterbury to Canada, shortly after the Pope had paid a visit.\nThe local Anglicans decided to make their own Archmobile based on the Pope’s famous limousine.\nThey erected a polythene structure on the back of a pick-up truck and the poor man, along with his chaplain, almost suffocated inside it.\n Next Wish 'roo were here!

And their diet is one of the healthiest in the world.\nWhat’s been a traumatic travel-related experience?\nIn Lagos, I was at a party given in honour of the Archbishop of Canterbury when seafood was served.

I will leave that to your imagination.\nMost memorable view?\nLooking over the Serengeti in East Africa, first thing in the morning.\nFavourite restaurant?\nI love the food at Roast in Borough Market, Southwark, South London. The restaurant is run by a friend and he delivers a superb breakfast.\nWhat's on your bucket list?\nA rail journey through the Rockies.\nWhere next and what for?\nTo South Africa to help set up business opportunities for young people involved in a scheme run by YCare, which I co-founded many years ago.\nThen to New Zealand to complete the sequel to The Voyage Of The Golden Handshake.
