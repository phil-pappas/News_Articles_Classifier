AutoPacific's IVAs recognize vehicles that best meet their owner's expectations and desires, helping consumers make informed vehicle purchase decisions with \"owners talking\" feedback.\nThe 2015 awards are based on responses from over 66,000 new vehicle owners across all major manufacturers. Surveyed after 90 days of ownership, respondents were asked what changes they would make to their car or truck in 15 key categories, including ride and handling, driver's seat comfort, interior storage, safety features, interior lighting, power and acceleration and technology. \"While no vehicle has a zero percent desire for change in all areas, IVAs recognize vehicles where owners want the least amount of change across the 15 surveyed attributes,\" explains George Peterson , president of AutoPacific.\nPorsche and GMC Most Ideal Brands in 2015 - Again\nPorsche ranks as the top luxury brand for the third year in a row.
