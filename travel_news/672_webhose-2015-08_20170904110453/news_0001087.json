British Airways currently has eight 787s with 34 more on order, adding an additional 42 aircraft to Boeing’s growing Component Services customer base.\n“Our fleet of 787s continues to grow, as does the expertise of our engineers in maintaining this modern and sophisticated aircraft,” said Andy Kerswill, director of engineering, British Airways. “This new Boeing service, which provides us with replacement parts quickly and efficiently, will help us to maintain our global 787 flight schedule and continue to deliver a consistently great performance for our customers.”\nUnder the Component Services program, Boeing establishes and maintains a pool of parts, selected to fit each customer’s fleet needs. The customer contacts Boeing for quick replacement of program-covered parts, which are shipped within a timeframe determined by the airline, based on their criticality. Boeing handles the repair, upgrade or warranty service when the customer returns the unserviceable part.\n“Boeing’s industry-leading services offer a simple way for airlines to reduce the total cost of airplane ownership, giving them a competitive advantage in their markets,” said Rick Anderson, vice president of sales, Boeing Commercial Aviation Services. “We look forward to helping British Airways get the best possible performance from their 787 fleet.”\nBoeing Commercial Aviation Services is a business unit of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, offering the aviation industry’s broadest portfolio of customer support and services to more than 12,000 airplanes worldwide, with 330 field services offices in 60 countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:47:57.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
