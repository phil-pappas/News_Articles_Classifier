It has heavy granite crosses dotted amongst the graves. Over 20,000 enemy dead lie beneath the sodden grass. There are no plants here to soften the horror, not a rose or daisy blooms. Death is stark, lonely and terrifying. But this soulless place holds something startling that should crack open even the hardest heart as it did mine. “The Grieving Parents” sculpted by Kathe Kollwitz in tribute to her youngest son Peter killed in 1914 sits by a low green hedge. On their knees the mother’s head is bowed to hide her tears, the father stares in disbelief at the ninth stone before him, Peter’s grave. Susan Dillon, from Berkshire, wins a voucher with DialAFlight A military cemetary in Belgium Photo: Fotolia/AP Czech Republic Strolling down the grey brick path towards the entrance of the beautiful red-roofed, cream-walled Pinkas Synagogue in Prague, I knew what to expect. I knew the walls contained the names, DOB, dates of death/ transportation of 77,297 Bohemian-Moravian Jews who had died during the Holocaust and I knew about the drawings by the children in the Terezin ghetto. Entering the synagogue the rooms are bare, silent despite the number of visitors. There is nothing but the names of those that perished. Each name painstakingly painted in tiny letters is a memorial to someone who had hopes, dreams, a future. Through this simplicity the sheer scale and horror of the Holocaust resonates. The drawings by the children are moving beyond any words. Belinda Smith, Herefordshire Russia My favourite war memorial must be the Aljosha in Murmansk. It is a huge 89 metre statue of a soldier as he stands bravely defending the city against its enemies from the shore. Made of white granite, the statue looks out to the sea towards Atomflot’s harbour of nuclear submarines and icebreakers. There are these Aljosha monuments all over Russia, but Murmansk has the most striking setting of them all. Martin Hughes, by email A giant soldier memorial statue in Russia Photo: Fotolia/AP Japan We have visited Nagasaki and we were so impressed at the courtesy shown to us by the local people when we inquired how to visit the Peace Park. The tram journey only took a few minutes, a long escalator, in several sections, took us up to the beautifully maintained park. We then noticed many schoolchildren, all beautifully dressed, assembling without a single sound in front of the Peace statue. On the stroke of 11, on a word from their teacher, they all bowed in perfect unison. After two minutes complete silence, and another word from their teacher, the children returned to being noisy, typical schoolkids, but left us with a memory to cherish. Colin Mills, Darlington France The Devonshire cemetery at Mansell Copse, in the Somme, is the perfect place for contemplation. Here lie the bodies of over 160 soldiers of the Devonshire regiment who were killed as they followed orders to attack the village of Mametz. The outcome was hinted at the previous day by the poet William Noel Hodgson in his poignant poem “Before Action”. Captain Duncan Lenox Martin, had, also, been on leave prior to the attack. He built a Plasticine model of the layout of the land, highlighting the position of the German machine gun and hence the impossible position of the Devonshires. Needless to say the attack took place and 160 men were predictably slaughtered, including Hodgson and Martin. The bodies were dragged back to Mansell Copse and buried in their trench, where the tribute above can be seen today. Peter Currell, by email Recently while driving in France near Limoges, we came across the nearby town of Oradour-sur-Glane in the Limousin. What we discovered was a vision of horror as no one could have imagined. Coming out of our car, a complete silence enveloped us, no birds sang, nothing but a feeling of eeriness around us. Nothing had been touched since that fateful day on the June 10 1944 when the Germans had arrived in that charming little place, and within a short time, had destroyed it all and massacred the inhabitants. They rounded up all the schoolchildren, toddlers and babies in prams, and the rest of the inhabitants of Oradour plus some from other villages. In total 642 people were shot dead or burnt alive in the church. Only one boy and a few adults escaped. Martine Hamilton, Cornwall An abandoned church in Oradour sur Glane Photo: Fotolia/AP Vietnam A visit to Ho Chi Minh City should include The War Remnants Museum. This unashamedly biased view of the Vietnam War offers a perspective that many will not have heard. Prepare for an emotionally draining experience. There are military vehicles and armaments to view along with a mock up of the notorious Phu Quoc prison including the inhumane “tiger cages” which housed Viet Cong prisoners. Claire Muir, Hampshire United States A visit to New York City is not complete without a visit to St Pauls Chapel of Trinity Church. Built in 1766, the oldest public building in Manhattan, once the place of worship for George Washington. It is now a memorial to the tragic events of 9/11. Not a pane of glass was shattered in this building, despite it’s proximity to the site of the World Trade Centre Towers. The only damage being a Sycamore tree in the church yard. Following 9/11 it offered spiritual and physical comfort to all the men and women and rescuers who worked tirelessly round the clock to find survivors. It now houses memorials, sent from around the world, including poems, letters and photographs. Edythe Chapman, Darlington A cemetary at St Paul's Church in New York Photo: Getty Images Zimbabwe One of the more bizarre war memorials is just outside Harare in Zimbabwe. Known as 'Hero’s Acre ', it is dedicated to those killed in Rhodesia’s “bushwar” of the 1970s. But not all those who were killed are eligible. Certainly not Ian Smith’s white soldiers, but nor are Joshua Nkomo’s ZANLA soldiers either. The 40 metre high North Korean made memorial, in the shape of a Kalashnikov rifle, is dedicated entirely to prominent supporters – be they soldiers or politicians – of the ZANU[PF] regime of Robert Mugabe. It features two heavily armed men and one woman also carrying an AK 47 rifle. Some 64 supporters are currently buried there and it is deemed to be the highest accolade that can be paid to a Zimbabwe citizen!
