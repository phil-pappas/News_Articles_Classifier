Franklin / AP) Business AAA predicts busiest Labor Day holiday roads in 7 years \nIf you're planning to make this the first Labor Day weekend in a few years that you load up the car and hit the road, you're not alone, according to AAA. 8 \nLow gas prices and higher wages mean more Americans will travel during the holiday than in any year since 2008, AAA predicts. Airports will be busier too, with the number of Illinois air travelers expected to increase 3.1 percent, compared with last year's holiday, it says. Air travel traffic over the Labor Day holiday is expected to rise 3 percent compared with last year, to 14.2 million passengers, as airlines in the U.S. continue to add seats and upgrade aircraft during an era of industry prosperity and increased scrutiny. ( Gregory Karp ) \nHigher levels of job security are helping families feel better about spending some cash at the end of the summer, says AAA, which expects 35.5 million Americans to take trips of 50 miles or more from home over the weekend. \nIn Illinois, 1.9 million people are expected to travel, a 0.8 percent increase from 2014. More than 1.7 million will be driving, while just over 72,000 will be flying to their destination, according to AAA. \nThe number of cars on the road has been rising in the last year, fueled by gas prices that have fallen significantly. The average price for regular unleaded gas in Illinois on Thursday was $2.98 a gallon, down from $3.52 in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:27:09.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
