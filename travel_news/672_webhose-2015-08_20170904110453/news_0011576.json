Been there done that -- 20 years ago.\"\n1. See the Northern Lights\nThe greatest light show on earth. Hands down.\nBut before you get too lost in the beauty of the Northern Lights, it's worth remembering there are some pretty impressive forces at work behind the scenes.\nCaused by collisions between gaseous particles in the Earth and sun's atmospheres, the Northern Lights commonly appear during the winter months in northern countries like Canada, Finland, Alaska, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and the place that seems to be on everyone's travel wish list right now, Iceland.\nThat includes Akureyri, which topped Lonely Planet's \" 10 Best Places in Europe \" list in June.\nLess than 100 kilometers from the Arctic Circle, it's Iceland's second-largest city and a great spot to watch the aurora borealis dance through the sky.\nSaga Travel - Day Tours , Kaupvangsstraeti 4, Akureyri 600 Iceland;\n2. Sleep in an overwater bungalow\nThe Four Seasons Bora Bora has 100 overwater bungalows. Nothing says \"my vacation is way more awesome than yours\" quite like an Instagram photo taken from the edge of your overwater bungalow -- particularly when it's in Bora Bora, according to TripAdvisor's users.\nCan't decide which resort to choose?\nThe Four Seasons Bora Bora is consistently rated as one of the world's best overwater bungalow resorts.\nNot hard to see why.\nIt's made up of 100 overwater bungalows with traditional teak wood furnishings and roofs thatched with pandanus leaves that sit on stilts over a turquoise lagoon.\nFour Seasons Resort Bora Bora , Motu Tehotu BP 547, 98730 French Polynesia;\n3. Admire the sunset over Santorini\nOpen any Greece travel brochure and chances are you'll see a shot of the famed blue and white domed houses of Santorini.\nBut the island's sunsets, which rank up there with some of the best in the world, are just as deserving of travelers' attention.\nThe village of Oia is where you'll find some of the best sunset views, whether you choose to take it all in from a restaurant or offshore on a boat.\nSunset in Oia , Sentrum, Oia Greece;\nMORE: Which Greek island should you go to?\n4. Trek the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu\nStart breaking in those hiking boots now. Archaeologists believe the Inca Trail was constructed as a holy pilgrimage to prepare visitors to enter Machu Picchu.\nThere are a few route options, ranging from two to seven days. The most popular is a high-altitude 43-kilometer (27-mile) hike through some pretty rough -- but beautiful -- terrain that takes four days to complete.\nThe payoff is obviously worth it.\nDoesn't matter how many photos you've seen, there's nothing quite like laying your own eyes on the legendary \"Lost City of the Incas\" -- Machu Picchu.\nMachu Picchu , Inca Trail, Machu Picchu Peru;\n5. Explore the Galapagos Islands\nGiven this wildlife-filled archipelago hundreds of miles off Ecuador's shores came out on top in Travel + Leisure's 2015 list of the world's best islands , it's no surprise it ranks highly among TripAdvisor users as well.\nFor a full-on Galapagos experience there's the 10-day cruising expedition with conservation-focused Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic Endeavour .\nThe voyages have a strong photography slant, with most on-board naturalists certified by National Geographic as photo instructors too.\nMORE: Where science meets luxury: Cruising the Galapagos on National Geographic's ship\n6. Visit Italy's Amalfi Coast\nThe best way to experience the beauty of Amalfi Coast, with its rugged cliffs and pastel hued villages that stretch 50 kilometers along the southern side of Italy's Sorrentine Peninsula?\nFrom the passenger seat of a vintage convertible, naturally.\nIt's considered one of the world's prettiest road trips, so we sympathize if you find yourself manning the wheel.\nYou'll be too busy navigating those hairpin bends to really enjoy the views.\nIf you're looking for a really special place to stay, the Monastero Santa Rosa, overlooking the Amalfi Coast, is a lavish hotel and spa in a former monastery.\nMonastero Santa Rosa Hotel & Spa , Via Roma 2 Amalfi Drive, 84010 Conca dei Marini Italy;\n7. Photograph the \"Big Five\" on safari\nReady to fulfill your childhood NatGeo dreams and photograph the \"big five\" on an African safari?\nSouth Africa's Kruger National Park's got the quintet you crave -- lions, leopards, elephants, buffaloes and rhinos. Plus a few extras.\nThe largest game reserve in South Africa, it's home to over 500 bird species, 100 reptiles and nearly 150 mammals.\nKruger National Park , Nelspruit 1350 South Africa;\n8. Take the ultimate road trip\nRoute 66 has been called \"the most famous highway in the world\" and remains the ultimate road trip.\nIt was officially designated in 1926 and covers eight states -- Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\nThese days, more than 2,000 of Route 66's original 2,448 connected miles -- about 85% -- can still be driven.\nRandom tidbit: In 1937 while on a summer drive on the famous highway John Steinbeck conceived of \"The Grapes of Wrath.\"\nMORE: Endless highway: How to drive the ultimate American road trip\nRoute 66 , Route 66;\n9. Set foot on Antarctica\nDouble the size of Australia, Antactica is the windiest place on the planet. As any adventurer worth his or her worn-in \"bunny boots\" will agree, you ain't hardcore till your gnarled toes have made contact with the coldest place on the planet -- Antarctica.\n( Seeing it from a plane doesn't count.)\nSo how long have tourists been making the long, cold journey south?\nThe year 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of commercial tourism to Antarctica.\nThese days dozens of tour companies in Argentina, Australia, Chile and New Zealand offer expeditions to Antarctic stations from November to March.\nFor a list of companies committed to safe and environmentally sound tourism practices, check out the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators website .\nThe South Pole , South Pole;\n10. Ride the Trans-Siberian railway\nBring on the vodka -- you're going to need it if you plan to see this epic train journey though to completion.\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway chugs its way across Russia over 9,300 kilometers of track, connecting Moscow to the far eastern port town of Vladivostok.\nThough most people get off along the way to explore, riding the entire distance with no stops takes around seven full days.\nTrans-Siberian Railway - Day Trips , Moscow - Beijing Moscow - Vladivostok Russia;\nHave you had a chance to experience one of your own dream trips?
