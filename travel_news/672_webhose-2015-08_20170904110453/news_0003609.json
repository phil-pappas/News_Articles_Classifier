Here’s a boast you can make to your colleagues when they ask what you got up to at the weekend: “Oh, I entered an ultra-marathon,” you can say, nonchalantly. “Yep, some mates and I ran non-stop for 24 hours… It was just a little stretch of the legs.” As it happens, your modest understatement could well contain a grain of truth. The main premise of a 24-hour relay race is that at least one person in each team is running at all times for an entire day. But some races, such as the Endurun24 , allow you to enter in teams of up to 24 people, which means you’ll only have to run for an hour each to complete the course. If you fancy a more hardcore challenge, you could enter one of these epic races as a pair, or in a team of four. That way, you’ll have to plan a routine that makes the best use of everyone’s energy, and as a bare minimum you’ll end up on your feet for six hours apiece. To achieve such a feat, you’ll need to put in some training. But by treating it as a group enterprise rather than a one-man test of mind over matter, you’ll have plenty of incentive to improve your fitness and keep going during the event itself. Most of all, you’ll enjoy the sense of camaraderie that can only come from a shared physical challenge in which teamwork is the key to success Most 24-hour relay races pride themselves on creating a brilliant base-camp atmosphere. For example, the 24 Ultra Run , held in East Sussex in October, offers top-quality catering around the clock to keep competitors well-nourished and focused on the task at hand. In addition, there’s on-site camping and the chance to set up your own team HQ beside the course. As a result, the experience of competing will live long in your mind. You’ll feel like a seasoned athlete as you rest your weary limbs between running sessions, and you can even take advantage of a professional massage to keep you from stiffening up before you head back out on the trail. Most of all, though, you’ll enjoy the sense of camaraderie that can only come from a shared physical challenge in which teamwork is the key to success. Although you’ll be running alone, the fate of your fellow challengers rests upon your shoulders when you’re carrying the baton, giving you an added reason to keep pounding out the miles. Your mates will be on hand to cheer you on, and you’ll have ample opportunity to repay the favour during your own rest periods. That’s the beauty of a relay marathon: it combines the man-against-nature challenge of long-distance running with a profound sense of community more commonly associated with team sports. Even better, it gives you the opportunity to take on a scale of challenge that would be beyond most people’s abilities when flying solo. That enhances your sense of achievement when you pick up your winners’ medal. But the good news is that it doesn’t diminish your bragging rights when telling other people what you’ve done. However you tackle it, running non-stop for 24 hours is a feat that demands respect.
