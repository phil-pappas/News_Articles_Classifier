A 65-year old Viet Nam War veteran, who suffered an injury from an explosion at Khe Sahn in 1972 and had his right leg amputated above the knee, switched from Veterans Administration (VA) health care to Medicare, and would not get his ninth prosthesis because he occasionally used a wheelchair during business travel. A retired mechanic, who suffered a sepsis infection that resulted in the amputation of his right leg below the knee, would be denied a prosthetic device by Medicare because he takes a common medication for the treatment of hypertension. These real-life stories are drawn from the ranks of the estimated two million American amputees who would see significantly reduced access to care under a rule proposal now pending before Medicare, according to a warning issued today by the Amputee Coalition and the American Orthotic & Prosthetic Association (AOPA). While all of the individuals cited above qualify for reimbursement of care that is readily available today, the draft Medicare rule would \"turn back the clock\" to a time when the type of prosthetics available were less functional and provided less mobility. The proposed changes in coverage for services provided not only would have a devastating impact on Medicare amputee beneficiaries, but on all of the two million amputees in the U.S., since commercial health insurance payers and the VA tend to follow the lead of Medicare on coverage matters. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:45:54.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
