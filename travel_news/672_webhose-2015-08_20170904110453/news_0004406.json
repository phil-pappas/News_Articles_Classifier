The group, including representatives from a number of leading associations including ABPCO, AEO, EVCOM, ICCA and NOEA along with London & Partners, Tourism Northern Ireland, Visit England, VisitScotland and officials from the Department of Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS), were hosted by Visit Wales, Celtic Manor Resort and the Vale Resort before touring a number of other key venues including the Wales Millennium Stadium and Cardiff Castle. \nThe Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport & Tourism, Ken Skates said; “We were delighted to host the Business Visits and Event Partnership in Wales and showcase the latest high quality facilities we have to offer. The success of the NATO Wales Summit last autumn, along with Wales’ growing reputation for attracting high-profile sporting events such as the UEFA Champions League shows that Wales is now a compelling choice for international business and sporting events. The successful partnership approach to hosting this meeting - working with Cardiff Council, Cardiff Hoteliers, the Celtic Manor Resort and Vale Resort - has once again enabled Wales to show that it is a serious contender in the global events industry.” Michael Hirst OBE, Chair of the BVEP said; “ As well as being welcomed warmly and treated to some outstanding Welsh hospitality, its fair to say that we were all extremely impressed by both the ambitions of Wales to be a major live events destination but also the quality of the venues, infrastructure and service. There is no doubt that Wales has so much to offer and that offer is growing rapidly.” The visit included a trip to the Celtic Manor Resort, where plans for their new International Convention Centre with capacity for around 4,000 delegates were unveiled. Near Cardiff, the group were given a tour of the Vale Resort, including being shown the facilities used by the Welsh Rugby Team. The delegates also enjoyed a special dinner at the Resort’s 400 year old Hensol Castle which has undergone a £10 million revamp providing conference and exclusive hire facilities.
