Additionally, the representatives experienced Gulf Air’s latest products, both inflight and on-the-ground and visited the airline’s headquarters to meet with the national carrier’s executive management team to learn more about the Gulf Air offering.\nGulf Air launched a direct Moscow link in October 2014 and the route has seen steady growth. In support of this, the airline recently entered into a Special Prorate Agreement (SPA) with Russian carrier S7 Airlines enabling Gulf Air passengers to take flights beyond Moscow to and from the Russian cities of St Petersburg, Kazan, Samara, Volgograd, Rostov, Nizhny Novgorod, Perm, Ufa, Sochi and Voronezh. With a combined fare that is more attractive than those purchased separately, the SPA agreement allows passengers to purchase only one ticket, at a more competitive fare, for their entire journey instead of separate tickets for each individual carrier.\nGulf Air’s direct three weekly flights to Moscow Domodedovo Airport operate on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays.\nSource: Gulf Air.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:08:52.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
