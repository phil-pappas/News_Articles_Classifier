According to the official BASARNAS Twitter account, the aircraft, a short-haul ATR 42-300 airliner belonging to Trigana Air Service, was carrying 44 adult passengers, five children and infants, and five crew.\nThe plane was flying between Jayapura's Sentani Airport and Oksibil, south of Jayapura, the capital of Papua province.\nThe agency's Jayapura office was coordinating the search, a separate tweet read as dusk set in in the tropics.\nAir transport is commonly used in Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province, where land travel is often impossible.\nIt was not immediately clear if search efforts would continue into the night in the densely forested mountainous region where the aircraft was flying.\nTrigana has been on the EU blacklist of banned carriers since 2007. Airlines on the list are barred from operating in European airspace due to either concerns about safety standards, or concerns about the regulatory environment in their country of registration.\nTrigana has had 14 serious incidents since it began operations in 1991, according to the Aviation Safety Network's online database. Excluding this latest incident, it has written off 10 aircraft.\nIndonesia has a patchy aviation safety record and has seen two major plane crashes in the past year, including an AirAsia flight that went down in the Java Sea, killing all on board.\nThat crash prompted the government to introduce regulations aimed at improving safety.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T22:02:41.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
