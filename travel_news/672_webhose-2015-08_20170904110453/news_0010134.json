More LG misses forecasts as profits slump \nCorporate filings earlier this month showed that profits at Macau’s six biggest casino companies slumped by 40 per cent in the first half of the year. Pressure on the gaming groups is set to grow as they are scheduled to open more than $20bn worth of new casinos and entertainment facilities this year and next. \nRobert Drake, chief financial officer of Galaxy Entertainment, one of the largest casino operators, warned that it was “too early to call the bottom”. \nThe Macau economy is heavily reliant on the casino industry, which expanded at breakneck pace over the past decade thanks to high-rollers from the mainland who were flush with cash from China’s boom. \nBut Macau experienced its first drop in annual gaming revenue last year as Chinese president Xi Jinping’s anti-graft drive scared off many Chinese VIP gamblers and tighter financing conditions restricted the credit provided to punters by the middlemen known as junkets. \nSome of Macau’s casinos, which are owned by a mix of Hong Kong tycoons and US gambling moguls such as Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson, have started closing high-stakes VIP gambling rooms and laying off dealers. \n“The figures speak for themselves but we have to put them into the perspective of what’s been happening since 2002,” said Glenn McCartney, an assistant professor of gaming and hospitality management at the University of Macau and the owner of an Irish pub in the territory. “We’ve had significant growth, with gaming revenues rising to seven times those of Las Vegas.” \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley expect gross gaming revenue in Macau to fall 24 per cent this year to $33bn, which is still around five times the size of the revenues generated by the Las Vegas casinos. \n“The economic contraction was mainly due to a decline in exports of services, of which exports of gaming services decreased by 40.5 per cent year-on-year and exports of other tourism services dropped by 21.5 per cent,” the Macau statistics agency said. \nMany of Macau’s 600,000 population are still profiting from the casino and hotel industry, with the unemployment rate at just 1.8 per cent. \nThe government has warned that if the downturn continues, and its gaming tax income falls further, it may have to start cutting expenditure. \nMr McCartney said the government should think carefully before doing so because Macau needs to invest more in marketing, infrastructure and training if it is to realise its ambitions to become a more well-rounded tourism destination that it less dependent on casinos. \nThe Macau casino operators are spending billions of dollars on glitzy new resorts that will open over the next two years in a bid to broaden the appeal of the territory to mass market gamblers and non-betting tourists. \nAnalysts say that these new facilities may attract more visitors in future but the extra capacity could sharpen the pain for the tiny territory in the short term.
