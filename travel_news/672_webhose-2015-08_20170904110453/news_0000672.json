The latest step in this direction is a new Jim Courier Tennis program launched at Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay. \nExpanding its international fitness program, the resort has appointed a resident Jim Courier Tennis (JCT) international coaching professional, Ling Chan, to cater for the needs of all levels from amateur to elite. Bringing more than five years’ experience coaching both adults and juniors in the US and Hong Kong, Chan will be in-residence until January 2016 offering daily clinics including Adults Tennis, Kids Tennis, and the dynamic and energetic Cardio Tennis for a high-intensity work-out that is just as popular with non-players. Private sessions, social match-ups and 'sparring' with a hitting partner are also available, and the resort’s synthetic grass court is lit for night play. \nThe Jim Courier Tennis program is the latest enhancement to the resort’s fitness offerings. Guests enjoy a variety of sports-related activities following the launch of AntiGravity® or ‘flying’ yoga as well as a Visiting Practitioners (VP) program. The VP program features a different international professional each month with sessions ranging from beach boot camps to kettle bell weight training. In-house guests enjoy a selection of complimentary VP activities and tennis clinics, while non-resident guests are also welcome to join. \n“As a beachfront resort, Jimbaran is the perfect location for guests seekingan active beach holiday, perhaps to catch up on recreational pursuits that they struggle to find time for in normal daily life,” said Uday Rao, General Manager of Four Seasons Resorts Bali. “The new Jim Courier Tennis program adds to our existing fitness services and community events, and guests tell us that they enjoy keeping active on holiday as much as they enjoy the relaxation and massages and great cuisine that Bali has to offer. They return home feeling reenergized and better-than-ever, and that’s exactly how a holiday should end.” \nFour Seasons Jimbaran Bay has also played a key role in community-based fitness events such as the Bali International Triathlon, of which it has been an annual major sponsor since its inception eight years ago. This year’s triathlon in October is expected to attract hundreds of athletes from across the globe, participating in the Olympic-distance and short courses as individuals or teams. \nMeanwhile, the resort’s stylish beach-club and restaurant, Sundara, is sponsoring the inaugural Roxy #runsupyoga event on 15 August. Some 200 women and girls are expected to join Roxy’s global athletes – including Olympic champion snowboarder Torah Bright, 2x world longboard champion Kelia Moniz and pro surfers Monyca Eleogram, Bruna Schmitz and Bianca Buitendag – for a social and fun fitness event comprising a beach jog, stand-up paddle boarding and yoga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T10:23:10.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
