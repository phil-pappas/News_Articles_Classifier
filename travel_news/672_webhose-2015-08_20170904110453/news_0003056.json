Opened in 2013, the £43m park has become a day-trip favourite for families in Scotland’s Central Belt. On the water, take your pick from pedalos, canoes and kayaks. On bikes, there’s an easy path network, connected to two National Cycle Routes . But with its musical stairs, climbing frames for all ages and spiralling slides, the play park steals the show.\nRelated: In search of Scotland’s best beach\nFun fact\nThere’s a sign on the slides encouraging adults to be big kids and have a go, too.\nBest things about it\nTrampolines built into the ground (another “fun for adults too” feature). It’s a cracking day out for dogs as well, with plenty of water to swim in. There’s a “splash play” area where dozens of jets shoot water into the air – and changing areas to dry off . Let’s be honest, it’s Scotland and you’re unlikely to dry in the sun.\nWhat about lunch?\nThere are three-quid sandwiches and paninis in the Horsebox cafe, but queues can build up quickly. Bring a packed lunch if you want to save time and money. Teas and coffees are reasonably priced, all £1.80 or below.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Kelpies sculptures are the largest works of art in Scotland. Photograph: David Rankin/Alamy Exit through the gift shop?\nThe only souvenir you need is a photo of The Kelpies. Visible from miles around, they’re beautiful up close, even if the critics slated them .\nRelated: What’s new in your favourite UK holiday spots\nGetting there\nIt’s a 30-minute drive from Edinburgh and Glasgow on the M8. Cyclists should put aside a good two to three hours if travelling alongside the Union Canal from Edinburgh. The Helix is a 15-minute cycle from Falkirk High railway station, which is also well served by the local bus. Be prepared for a tough cycle up some seriously steep hills back to Falkirk High station.\nValue for money?\nYes, entry is free, as is car parking.\nOpening times?\nIt’s a public park and never closes.\nVerdict\n7/10. As with most public art, the kids will be bored of the Kelpies within minutes. Luckily, possibly Scotland’s best play park is in their shadow. It’s got a strong returnability factor, thanks to thoughtful design: for example, climbing frames with graded ability levels for different ages. If only they’d put those slides inside the giant horse heads.\n• thehelix.co.uk\n• This feature was amended on 11 August. It’s not the Union canal running through the park, as originally stated, but the Forth and Clyde canal.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+The+Helix%2C+Falkirk%2C+Scotland%0D%0A&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F11%2Fhelix-park-kelpies-falkirk-scotland-family-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F10%2F1439211546652%2Fc5b1c70c-e9c6-4451-91aa-0de6200ea72d-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.thehelix.co.uk/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+The+Helix%2C+Falkirk%2C+Scotland%0D%0A&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bdvk%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bdvk%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/union-canal"], "published": "2015-08-11T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T23:43:57.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
