Notably, tourism contributed 7 percent to the France’s economy last year bringing in 150 billion euros.\nAlthough, the contribution of tourism to the overall economy in France looks promising, the government is concerned with the fact that visitors tend to spend less in France than elsewhere. In order to encourage more tourists spending in the country, the government has extended store opening hours and tried to improve the much maligned customer service.\nDespite boasting of some of the best tourist spots in the world, the infamous French surliness poses a major stumbling block on the road to tourism victory.\nInfact, the TripAdvisor website frequently votes Paris the rudest city in Europe.\nInspite of all these hurdles, the Tourism Minister is hopeful that the number of tourists will surpass 85 million this year with an increase in foreign tourist spending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:40:06.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
