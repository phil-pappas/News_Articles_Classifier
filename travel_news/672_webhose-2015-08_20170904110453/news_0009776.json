The theme is Evolution Revolution, and that fits right in with what is going on here right now. People will be moving from their hotels to the convention center, seeing the Riverwalk and everything along the way” during the three-day conference.\n“It’s a chance to really showcase what this county has to offer,” said Visit Tampa Bay spokesman Kevin Wiatrow¬ski. “The conference has never been here before. It really shows the degree to which this part of the state has risen in the realm of tourism that they would hold the conference here. They are now thinking about this area as a destination.”\nDuring some past conferences, travel experts have been sequestered in resorts or other venues without really getting out to see the city or county in which they are held, Corrada said. Not this time.\nConference participants can walk out the door of the convention center and head out to any part of the county they desire, or stay close by and take in downtown restaurants or travel to Busch Gardens or Lowry Park Zoo to take in the same fun tourists might experience.\nWhile inside the convention center, travel experts will discuss trends in the industry, learn how to use social media to their advantage and how to promote their areas as LGBT destinations. They’ll also learn what to expect from China in terms of tourism.\nBoth Visit Tampa Bay and Visit St. Pete-Clearwater have been promoting this area for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender weddings and vacations, and Visit Florida is keying in on China’s exploding outbound travel market and the dollars that will flow into the state.\nA session on how to use YouTube as the platform for tourism videos will also be conducted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T22:05:25.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
