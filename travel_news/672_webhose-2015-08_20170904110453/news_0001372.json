Sign In Here Greenway Automotive CEO: Frank Rodriguez , Carl Atkinson Westgate Resorts CEO: David Siegel , 80 Most difficult challenge my firm faced in the past 12 months: We bought the Las Vegas Hilton and renamed it the Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. We are restoring this 46-year-old iconic property while keeping it open during construction. While it would have been cheaper to shut it down and re-open when the construction was completed, I couldn’t in good conscience lay off more than 2,000 people. Instead, we learned to operate under the most difficult circumstances, protecting the jobs of our team members. Key business accomplishment this year: We are on track to generate over $1 billion in revenue and the highest profit margin in the history of the company. Plans for the next 12 months: We are developing Westgate Anaheim Gardenwalk Resort right at the entrance of Disneyland. Newest product: Adding amenities to our resorts, including water parks, restaurants, spas and activity centers, to give our guests a greater value during their stay. We have new projects at every resort location, and we recently opened Shipwreck Island, a water park at Westgate Vacation Villas in Central Florida. Greatest lesson learned: Never give up. What I’m learning now: I’m on a mission to save lives by reducing the number of young people who die each year due to drug and alcohol abuse. I am traveling the country meeting with experts in this field to learn as much as I can and develop a strategy to combat this serious challenge. What I’ve read that others should read: You should read the news every day. What I’ve done that others should do: Don’t be a couch potato. Constantly challenge yourself to get out, meet new people and try new things. Opportunities I see in my industry: Using technology to engage our timeshare owners and resort guests 365 days a year, not just when they are staying with us This keeps me up at night: The fact that someone dies due to drug and alcohol problems every four minutes If I had a parrot, its first words would be: “Turn out the lights.” Most life-changing experience: The loss of my daughter, which motivated me to build the Victoria’s Voice Foundation in her honor to help young people experiencing challenges such as drug and alcohol abuse. Waste Pro USA CEO: John J. Jennings Most difficult challenge lately: Dealing with the downgrades in health benefits prescribed in the health care law. We always have provided benefits that exceed the limits of this law and we were faced with reducing employee benefits or face a nonsensical surcharge. Key business accomplishment this year: Growth of our rewards program and incentives for health and safety advancements. We reward those who make our workday a happier, positive environment for fellow employees. Plans for the next 12 months: Growth both organically and through acquisition, while continuing to enhance service, community involvement, employee education and operational practices Newest service: Organic digestion, expanded compressed natural gas fleet and our new materials recovery facilities in Ocala and Atlanta Greatest lesson learned: You can achieve any amount of success if you’re willing to work for it. What I’m learning now: Our upcoming generation of leaders has the talent and drive to better enhance our interaction between personal and work needs. What I’ve read that others should read: Good to Great How failure has shaped my life: Failure has taught me to get up and try again. What I’ve done that others should do: Keep my mouth closed long enough for my ears to hear. Opportunities I see in my industry: We have grown to the point where we are able to be the private equity partner or the subordinated debt backer for young environmental entrepreneurs across the U.S and Latin America who intend to bring improved sanitary needs to more rural areas in the U.S. or the Latin American nations where these needs are so prevalent. If I had a parrot, its first word would be: Think Most life-changing experience: Coming to Florida as a 21-year-old and seeing that beautiful blue sky’s positive vibes that beckoned me to take advantage of the opportunity that was all around A. Duda & Sons Inc. CEO: David Duda , 53 My firm’s key business accomplishment this year: We came through the recession in a stronger position, having restructured and focused on growing key parts of our business. This put us in a position to look ahead and dedicate time and capital into our infrastructure and people. We launched an ERP software project this year, and we expanded the capabilities of our human resources department to develop our people. My firm’s newest service/product: In our Duda Farm Fresh Foods business, our ongoing investment in research and development of proprietary celery varieties allows us to develop value-added offerings such as our 4-inch and 8-inch fresh-cut celery sticks you can buy locally at Publix, Costco and Walmart. Using consumer research, we also expanded our value-added radish offerings. In Viera, our homebuilding arm Viera Builders introduced, with great success, several new home products to the market, including alley-loaded home designs new to the Brevard County market. Opportunities I see developing in our industry and how we can capitalize on them: There are three trends we see that we are well-positioned to meet. R Healthy lifestyles: This is not a fad, and as producers of fruit and vegetables, we are excited to be in position to meet consumer demand for fresh, healthy food products. R Housing recovery: We are pleased to have a thriving Viera community in Brevard County, along with a home-building division. We are seeing an uptick in demand for new home products and positive economic development and growth in Brevard County. R Social responsibility: The way people care about social responsibility and resource stewardship lines up with who we always have been. As a Christian company, our values are stated clearly; we live them and share them: Faith in the Lord; faith in the goodness of people; responsibility to our customers, employees and owners; stewardship of the land and its resources; integrity in our business conduct; strength from diversity; and the need to grow. Rosen Hotels & Resorts CEO: Harris Rosen , 75 My firm’s plans for the next 12 months: Over the past six years, we have been involved in implementing a $150 million refurbishment program at our seven hotels, which includes new construction. This program will continue through this year and the following four years. My firm’s newest service/product: We opened Club 39 At The Plaza in spring 2015 at Rosen Plaza. This fall at Rosen Plaza, we’ll also launch a new Orthodox kosher catering service that requires the building of two new certified kosher kitchens. At the Rosen Inn closest to Universal, we’ll soon complete a new sushi bar. We’re very excited about having these new services to offer to the Orlando community and our guests. Greatest lesson I’ve ever learned: To never give up What I’m learning now: Patience How failure has shaped my life: Everyone has failures. It’s inescapable. I learned through failure that you can never give up. You have to keep going and keep the faith. What I’ve read that others should read: I enjoy reading books, especially biographies. I admire Jackie Robinson, so his biography is definitely a favorite. What I’ve done that others should do: I’m not sure there’s anything I’ve done that others should do. Others might want to consider using their success to help others. When I’m not working, I am: Working. I enjoy working so much, it feels almost like my recreation. I do enjoy reading by the pool, spending time with my four children and our dogs, and cooking when I have the time. My most life-changing experience: Through my lifetime, I’ve experienced three near-fatal auto accidents. Surviving these taught me I still had work to do. Sonny's Franchise Co. CEO: Bob Yarmuth My firm’s key business accomplishment this year: Sonny’s BBQ was ranked the #1 BBQ Chain in America by the Daily Meal. My firm’s plans for the next 12 months: Restaurant remodels throughout the Sonny’s BBQ system, updated restaurant technology installations and spreading the spirit of BBQ in our local communities My firm’s newest service/product: Redneck Eggrolls, Hot Links and Smoked Chicken Wings Greatest lesson I’ve ever learned: Never underestimate the power of culture.
