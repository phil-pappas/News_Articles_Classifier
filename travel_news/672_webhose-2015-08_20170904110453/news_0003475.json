In the past, many women would buy beauty products for their attractive packaging or appealing fragrance; now I’m seeing more demand for authoritative, evidence-based advice. Women are sceptical about spending money without seeing data supporting manufacturers’ claims. I am seeing women eager to embark on a more intensive skin care routine that tackles problem areas and makes the most of their positive attributes. Many have lost faith in anecdotal advice provided by beauty blogs, which can be ill-equipped to tackle serious skin problems such as acne and rosacea. If you have dry skin, try supplementing your diet with Omega 3 fatty acids Vitamins and supplements certainly have a role to play in conjunction with skincare – an inside-out approach makes sense. If you have dry skin, I would recommend supplementing your diet with Omega 3 fatty acids. Try Solgar Omega 3 Fish Oil Concentrate. As an alternative try Flaxseed Oil. I also recommend taking Vitamin D supplements all year. It’s difficult to rely on the sun for your recommended daily intake as the amount of UVB varies at different times of year and it’s hard to give consistent guidance safe amounts of sun exposure. So taking a supplement such as Solgar Vitamin D3 removes the guesswork. Another trend is people taking antioxidants as a way of boosting their body’s natural protective mechanisms against UV exposure – I think we’re going to see a lot more of these products in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T19:40:24.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
