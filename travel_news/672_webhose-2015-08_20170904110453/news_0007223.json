They are designed and developed at Airbus’ facility in Filton, near Bristol, where a number of other systems are designed and tested including fuel systems and landing gear.\nThe high-performance wings of the A350 XWB make the aircraft faster, more efficient and quieter. The wing design includes several streamlined features. Among these are droop-nose leading edge devices and new adaptive dropped-hinge flaps, which increase the jetliner’s efficiency at low speeds.\nTo improve efficiency at higher speeds, the A350 XWB can deflect its wing flaps differentially, optimising the wing profile and providing better load control.\nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:13:41.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
