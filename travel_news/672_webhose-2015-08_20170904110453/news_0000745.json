So, when he was 12 years old, his parents asked him what he wanted to do. Baking and pastry school, he told them. Worried that he would burn out at a young age, his mother and stepfather, who own a frites business, steered him in another direction. \nTwo years later, after completing the first of the three cycles that make up Belgian secondary education, they asked him again what he wanted to do next. His response was the same. This time, however, they relented, and Delanghe spent the next five years honing his techniques at Ter Groene Poorte, a culinary institution in his hometown of Bruges. \nBy 2013, Delanghe had worked at Pierre Hermé in Paris and L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon in Las Vegas. The folks behind Alexander’s Steakhouse in Cupertino and San Francisco, who also operate the Sea restaurant in Palo Alto, were planning to open a bakery-cafe. They came calling, and Delanghe decamped to Mountain View in early 2014. \n“Here, it’s more like a small-town feel than Vegas, more like home — where I come from originally,” he says. “It feels a lot more homey, with the farmers’ markets, the wine and art festivals.” \nAs the executive pastry chef at Alexander’s Patisserie, which opened its doors on Castro Street in October, the 27-year-old is responsible for developing the menu. But he also played a major role in various design aspects — from the kitchen equipment and packaging to the display cases and dining area. \nThe interior balances modern and classic with French influences. White patent leather chairs trimmed with nailheads surround marble-topped Eero Saarinen pedestal tables. The back corner is lined with damask wallpaper and outfitted with tufted banquette seating. Crystal chandeliers lend a luxe touch. \nThe treats Delanghe and his team produce are displayed in the contemporary part of the space. Rows of macarons, tarts, cakes, chocolates and pastries are meticulously arranged in custom, LED-lit glass cases. Equator coffee, sandwiches and freshly baked breads round out the offerings, which evolve as Delanghe experiments. \n“It’s nice to play around with flavors,” he says, noting that he is considering curry, mango and green tea. While the strawberry, basil and citrus tart is a recent addition that has been well received, not everything is a hit: “I tried a coffee tart, and nobody wanted a coffee tart with their coffee,” says Delanghe with a laugh. \nThe chef is constantly seeking inspiration as he tweaks the fare. He sampled a fennel pollen chocolate elsewhere and decided that honey would be a nice complement. Voilà! Alexander’s honey and fennel pollen bonbon. A spring trip to Paris, which included visiting 12 pastry shops in one day alone, has placed eclairs toward the top of his to-do list. \nThe best-sellers at Alexander’s are the chocolates and macarons. There are a dozen varieties of chocolates available, all made with Valrhona, and Delanghe would like to double that number. “Everybody’s fascinated by the colors,” he says of the artful creations. “A lot of people think that they’re marbles.” The marbling effect is done in a spray booth just beyond the kitchen doors. \nThe 13 macaron flavors range from vanilla, pistachio and caramel to pineapple ginger, whiskey and peach saffron. Delanghe, whose favorites are lemon and passion fruit, hopes to eventually offer at least 18 flavors. \nHe describes the ideal macaron: “There needs to be a good amount of filling. The cookie can’t be hollow and crumbly. It needs to have a little crunch on the outside, and be soft and chewy on the inside.” Even some of the batches he whips up don’t pass his rigorous standards (and often end up being given to employees). “It’s a hard thing to make,” he says. “They’re really temperamental little things.” \nThe baking and pastry staff at Alexander’s work around the clock, with three shifts per day. Everything is made from scratch. Delanghe usually arrives at 3 or 4 a.m. and spends 14 to 18 hours on the premises. \nOnce he has more downtime, he hopes to explore the Bay Area — perhaps catch an Earthquakes match at the soccer team’s new San Jose stadium, or enjoy a meal at nearby Chez TJ and at the French Laundry in Yountville. For now, though, he’s happy to focus on Alexander’s Patisserie. “This is my first job as an executive pastry chef, and being responsible for everything,” says Delanghe. “This is like my baby and I want to take care of it.” \nAnh-Minh Le is a freelance writer.
