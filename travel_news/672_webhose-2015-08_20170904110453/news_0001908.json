SERVES Makes 4 individual pies For the crust 200g ground almonds 50g rolled oats ¼ tsp ground cinnamon 5 Medjool dates, pitted 2 tbsp coconut oil For the filling 12 Medjool dates, pitted 250g pecans 5 tbsp almond milk 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract Pinch of nutmeg 1 tbsp coconut oil ½ tsp Himalayan or Celtic salt METHOD Begin by making the crust. Place the ground almonds, oats, cinnamon, dates and oil in a food processor and blitz for about 30 seconds until you have a rough, doughy texture. Divide the “dough” into four and press each piece into a 10cm fluted tart case. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up. Soak the dates for the filling in hot water for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/350F/Gas 4. To make the filling, place the drained dates, 220g of the pecans and the remaining ingredients in a food processor and blitz until glossy and smooth. Spoon the filling into the four prepared shells and smooth the tops. Place a few of the reserved pecans on each pie. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the filling is set. Leave to cool in the tins for a few minutes before carefully turning out and serving. Delicious with vegan ice cream or yoghurt.
