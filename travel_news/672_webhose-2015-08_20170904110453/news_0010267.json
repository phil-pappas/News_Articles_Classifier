Or they can serve up their own creations at \"Taste of NYC Food Cart.\"\nThey can also create their own music inside a soundproof laser tunnel.\nThe museum says the goal is to develop children's social, cognitive and motor skills and help them make sense of the world around them.\n\"NYC & Me: A Little Bite Of The Big Apple\" will run from Sept. 24 to Jan. 18.\n___\nOnline: www.cmom.org\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:21:22.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
