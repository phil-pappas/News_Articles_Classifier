Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 17, 2015 eTN   \nThe parliamentary hearings following the announcement of Kenya Airways’ losses for the 2014/15 financial year, prompted by frenzied populist politicians seeking to raise their own profile rather than making meaningful contributions to the development of the country, have brought about an unexpected windfall for the embattled national airline of Kenya. \nThe Kenya Civil Aviation Authority’s CEO Gilbert Kibe, when testifying before the committee, confirmed the airline’s technical competence and full compliance with the Kenya Civil Aviation Act of 2013 under which airlines registered in Kenya needed to be re-certified. Information received over the weekend suggests that KQ’s current Air Service License runs until March next year – and is expected to be renewed when the application is lodged with the KCAA – while their Air Operator Certificate, in short AOC, is due for renewal at the end of October and again expected to get the thumbs up after having completed four out of the five stages of re-certification already. \nKibe, according to a usually reliable source, confirmed before the Senate Committee that Kenya Airways’ technical competence is not in doubt and that they were competent to operate a commercial airline business. He in the same breath also confirmed that KCAA had no issues with those Kenya Airways’ management personnel designated under the act as ‘Accountable Manager’ confirming that they too met the criteria under the law for competence and industry experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:53:00.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
