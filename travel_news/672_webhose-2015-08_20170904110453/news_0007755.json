The opportunity to walk through pure, undeveloped land that has not seen the effects of human tampering are few and far between, as the trappings of modern civilization gain more and more ground. \nThey aren’t gaining at Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in Alaska, though. One of the immense park’s greatest assets, superintendent Philip Hooge says, is its sprawling scenery, mostly free of any trails, encouraging visitors to explore as they will. “It’s a huge, wild place,” Hooge says. “(Visitors enjoy) just being surrounded by wild, undeveloped area.” \nIt should come as no surprise that the park has remained so pristine. Access is a challenge: The only road to the park is through the small town of Gustavus, which can be reached by ferry from Juneau, or by plane. \nMost visitors arrive by cruise ship or tour boat. Alaska Airlines serves the small-town airport in the summer, and small charter planes are available year-round. \nThe park’s location does present it with some unique advantages. Whereas at other parks, visitors are limited in how far they can travel, Hooge says the bay itself, whose fingers reach miles inland, makes it possible for people to take their adventures farther. \n“That was one of the reasons the park was established,” he says. “The bay kind of acted like a walkway.” \nHooge also points out that the park’s main attraction is its most obvious: “People come to Glacier Bay to see glaciers.” \nThere are an estimated 1,045 glaciers in Glacier Bay Park, and they cover about 27% of the park. Seven of those are active tidewater glaciers that calve icebergs into the sea, an unpredictable event that is unaffected by weather and can sometimes occur multiple times within a one-hour visit, or not at all, the park’s website says. \nThe park features many opportunities for outdoor adventure, including several camping sites, a few hiking trails, and plenty of places to go kayaking through the bay. Birdwatching and sport fishing are also popular pastimes. \nVisitors are required to go through an orientation session at the park’s ranger station, to be informed of safety concerns. Hooge also urges travelers to bring flexible clothing, particularly since the park sees a lot of rainfall, about 150 inches of rain a year. \n“As long as you’re ready for a little rain, you’ll be great,” he says. \nTo learn about park sites from all 50 states, order USA TODAY’s special edition, National Treasures at onlinestore.usatoday.com.
