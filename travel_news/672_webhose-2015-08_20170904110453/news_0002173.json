His winning dish consisted of pan fried halibut with crispy chorizo, buttered spinach, brown shrimp and caper dressing, and sweet potato crisps. Cawse will now go on to the European final in Milan in October, and if successful, will compete against chefs from The Americas and Asia-Pacific semi-finals in New York next April. The popular Copper Skillet competition was introduced in 2004 to highlight the artistry and skill of the best chefs from IACC-member conference centres around the world. This adds to a triumphant year so far for Sundial chefs, having previously won the IACC Copper Skillet competition earlier in the year. Speaking about his success, Cawse said: “I am delighted and a little surprised to have won such a tough competition, especially taking into account the quality of some of the other competitor’s dishes. I am now looking forward to competing in the European cook-off in Milan and hope that I will be able to go all the way to America next year.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:02:39.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
