A £10.5 million refurbishment is now underway with the four star Apex City of Glasgow Hotel due to be fully operational in early October. Situated in the heart of Glasgow, minutes from attractions like the Style Mile, SSE Hydro and King’s Theatre, the new hotel will have 104 modern bedrooms including five duplex suites with striking views over the city. Bookings are now being taken for what will be the group’s ninth property. \nApex Hotels has built its reputation on offering affordable luxury to the leisure and corporate markets and the hotel boasts features including free high speed Wi-Fi and local calls as well as Sky in every room Ian Springford, Apex Hotels chairman commented: “We have been looking for the right opportunity to expand into Glasgow for some time. In terms of size and location, the Bath Street property is an ideal fit for Apex Hotels and will become a very welcome addition to our growing portfolio when it opens this autumn.” Apex Hotels purchased Marks Hotel from Glasgow based Rossmark Hotels, a sister venture to Glasgow property investment and development company, Belgate Estates, whose portfolio includes a shopping centre in Glasgow and Cumbernauld town centre. Stuart Wilson, Rossmark’s managing director commented: “After a successful period of operating the hotel, we wish to concentrate on our core property business.” The Glasgow property is one of two recent acquisitions for the group. Apex Hotels has also purchased a central site in Bath’s Conservation Area to develop a new 177 bedroom full service hotel with extensive conference facilities. Due to open in autumn 2016, the £35m development will be the hotel’s first hotel in England outside London.
