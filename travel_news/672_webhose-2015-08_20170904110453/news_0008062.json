The resulting programme – highlighting our beautiful landscape, arts and crafts, as well as Irish society and family life – will be seen by an estimated 80 million Chinese around the world (CCTV-4 is the only Chinese channel with a global reach). It will feature places like the Cliffs of Moher and Blarney Castle.\nA key element of Tourism Ireland’s promotional activity in China, to grow our share of this rapidly-growing tourism market,involves working with the media to generate positive publicity and raise awareness of the island of Ireland. Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “With an audience of about 80 million viewers, the Glamorous Ireland documentary is the kind of publicity that money simply could not buy and is an excellent way of showcasing the island of Ireland to potential Chinese holidaymakers. Working with journalists and TV crews is a key element of our annual promotional programme in China, to help secure a greater share of the 3+ million Chinese visitors who travel to Europe each year. Tourism Ireland aims to grow the number of Chinese visitors to the island of Ireland to 50,000 per year, by 2017.”\nTourism Ireland has offices in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu. As well as working closely with Chinese media, the organisation also undertakes co-operative promotions with key partners – including airlines and the travel trade.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:58:57.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
