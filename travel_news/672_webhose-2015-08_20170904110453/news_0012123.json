The deal will see Paddy Power shareholders control 52 per cent of the new business, with the remainder held by Betfair investors. Paddy Power shareholders would also receive a special dividend of €80m. More Rank profits rise on Mecca winning streak \nThe new group would have revenues of over £1.1bn, the companies said, and would keep both brands in Europe, have headquarters in both Dublin and London and a dual-listing. Betfair’s market capitalisation was £2.4bn at the close of trading on Tuesday while Paddy Power’s was €3.4bn (£2.5bn). \nBoth companies saw sharp rises in their share prices after the deal was announced on Wednesday, with Betfair up 18.6 per cent to £30.87 and Paddy Power rising by 16.6 per cent to €90.70 in early trading. \n“These are two businesses that are performing at a very high calibre and we will have a market-leading position in the UK, Europe, Ireland and Australia,” said Breon Corcoran, who left Paddy Power in 2012 to become chief executive of Betfair and will become the head of the combined group. \n“We are paying a slight premium but I regard this as a merger of equals,” he said. “We have known each other a long time. I used to wear a green jacket. We have been speaking intensely over the summer and warmly for a time before that.” \nMr Corcoran said he expected the competition authorities in several countries to evaluate the merger, but said he hoped the deal would complete next January. \n“We have agreed an exchange ratio that gives an 11 per cent premium [for Paddy Power] if you take the share price figure,” said Cormac McCarthy, Paddy Power’s chief financial officer. “But we agreed the ratio on the fundamental value of the two companies over time.” \nHe said the combined company would be called Paddy Power Betfair Plc. \n“Betfair is the leading exchange business in sports betting and that technology is something Paddy Power does not have,” he said. “We have a retail and mass market business and we have an Australian business that they do not have. If you look at the strategic rationale, synergies are not the first thing.” \nAndy McCue, Paddy Power’s chief executive, will become chief operating officer while Paddy Power chairman Gary McGann will be chairman of the combined group. Lombard \nBetty Power makes William Hill the wallflower \nIf you don’t bet, you can’t win. William Hill, current number one in the UK and Irish betting industry, is set to be superseded by “Betty Power”, as the combo of Paddy Power and Betfair has been jokingly dubbed \nRead more \nMr Corcoran would not be drawn on the likely cost savings, saying that he did not want to “set hares racing” among Paddy Power’s 5,000 staff in Ireland and Betfair’s 2,000 or so UK employees. \nThe merger is the latest round of consolidation in a sector where companies are searching for scale to compete in the face of greater tax and regulation. Earlier this summer, Ladbrokes and Coral announced a merger , and Bwin.party , another online gaming company, is being courted by both 888 and GVC . \nLess than a month ago, Paddy Power’s Twitter account joked that after the Ladbrokes and Coral merger, it had joined forces with Betfair. “Our new name is Betty Power,” it said. \nIn June, Betfair announced a 21 per cent rise in full-year revenues to £476.5m and a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to £94.8m. It said on Wednesday that its first-quarter revenues were up 15 per cent to £135.4m. \nPaddy Power, meanwhile, said its interim operating profit in the six months June 30 had risen 33 per cent to €80m and would have been higher but for €32m of new taxes and product fees. Operating profit in Australia was up 78 per cent to €38.8m, it said. \nFor Betfair, the deal comes just over two years after it rejected multiple bids from a private equity consortium led by buyout group CVC, which sought to acquire the business for as much as 950p a share. \nBetfair’s share price has more than doubled in the past year and its customer numbers have risen 52 per cent to 1.7m, as the online betting exchange nosed ahead with its mobile site and successfully targeted the mass market. \n* This article has been changed to remove an incorrect share price Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:26:39.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
