An absolute ban on all hunting trophies further extends our commitment to supporting the protection of endangered species and the elimination of illegal trading of animal products,” said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency, Mr. Akbar Al Baker. \nMore than 35,000 species (over 5,000 animals and 30,000 plants) are protected under the CITES, which includes, but is not limited to, great apes, the giant panda, many South American monkeys, cheetahs, lions, leopards, tigers, elephants and rhinoceroses. \nThe CITES is an international agreement between governments, which aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. There are three CITES appendices, under which species are classified, according to how threatened they are by international trade. \nCITES I includes species threatened with extinction. CITES II includes species for which trade must be controlled in order to avoid behaviour incompatible with their survival. CITES III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES parties for assistance in controlling the trade. This category covers species such as the two-toed sloth, African civet and the alligator snapping turtle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:11:24.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
