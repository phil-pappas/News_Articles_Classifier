Decide to Drive -the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers ' (Auto Alliance) distracted driving awareness program-released a lighthearted video series showing how everyday things can be big distractions to all drivers regardless of age and expertise.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in 2013, there were approximately 424,000 people injured in distracted driving-related crashes in the U.S.-an increase from the 421,000 people injured in 2012.\n\"The intent of Decide to Drive is to increase awareness about the risks of distracted driving because we'd rather all drivers decide to drive each time they get in the car to keep their bones and limbs intact,\" says orthopaedic trauma surgeon and AAOS spokesperson Douglas Dirschl , MD. \"These videos humorously but effectively highlight that sometimes even the smallest everyday activities can be big distractions behind the wheel.\"\nEach :30 video centers on one very big distraction-oversized electric razor, steaming cup of coffee, lipstick, food and smartphone-to illustrate the ridiculousness of different types of real life and potentially serious acts while behind the wheel.\nTo view the entire #NoSmallDistractions Video Series: https://youtu.be/9NpMgjCB5fY?list=PLF14035881D5F5034\nIn 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report listing the 50 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States with the overall number of motor vehicle crash fatalities:\nMetropolitan statistical area/Major cities\nOverall **\nAges 15–24 yrs\nNo.\nRate***\nNo.\nRate\nU.S. total\n34,485\n11.1\n7,451\n17.3\nMetropolitan statistical area total (n = 50)\n13,696\n8.2\n2,903\n13\nMajor city total (n = 63)\n3,985\n7.9\n769\n10.9\nNew York – Northern New Jersey – Long Island, New York – New\nJersey – Pennsylvania\n986\n5.1\n179\n7.3\nLos Angeles – Long Beach – Santa Ana, California\n848\n6.6\n173\n9.5\nHouston – Sugar Land – Baytown, Texas\n722\n12.6\n174\n21.5\nMiami – Fort Lauderdale – Pompano Beach, Florida\n634\n11.1\n124\n18\nDallas – Fort Worth – Arlington, Texas\n611\n9.8\n135\n15.6\nChicago – Naperville – Joliet, Illinois – Indiana – Wisconsin\n565\n5.9\n116\n8.8\nAtlanta – Sandy Springs – Marietta, Georgia\n564\n10.7\n94\n12.9\nPhiladelphia – Camden – Wilmington, Pennsylvania – New Jersey –\nDelaware – Maryland\n444\n7.3\n92\n11.2\nRiverside – San Bernardino – Ontario, California\n434\n10.6\n110\n16.8\nWashington – Arlington – Alexandria, DC – Virginia – Maryland –\nWest Virginia\n408\n7.5\n105\n14.4\n* Per 100,000 population.

Orthopaedic surgeons not only treat, but also want to prevent injuries that can result from distracted driving-related crashes.\nWreck-less checklist: Nine ways to avoid distracted driving\nPut on any accessories you may need, such as sunglasses or Bluetooth ™ ear pieces. Adjust seats, head rests, vehicle controls and mirrors. And don't forget to fasten your seat belt. Move all reading material away from easy reach. Pre-load mp3 playlist or CDs and adjust volume level so your music does not mask the sounds of emergency sirens. Enter an address in the navigation system before you depart or review maps and written directions before you drive. Stop your car in a safe area before attending to a child, a pet or having an involved discussion. Driving is not the time to apply makeup, groom, polish your nails, or change clothing. Do not eat or drink while driving. Do not text, make a call, take selfies or make vlogs while driving. Just put the phone away. At all times while operating your vehicle, keep your eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. In addition to DecidetoDrive.org , the awareness and prevention campaign includes print, television and radio public service advertisements; elementary school and high school educational curriculums; and active social media outreach. This year, the campaign celebrates five years of advocating for distracted driving awareness.\nFor more information, visit DecidetoDrive.org .
