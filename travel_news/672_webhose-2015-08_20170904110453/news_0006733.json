Our global sales and sourcing teams are in-market, meeting clients and suppliers face-to-face every day and listening to their needs. \n\n“Such frequency of contact and the exciting new opportunities technology presents to connect means we are less reliant on some trade shows to fulfill this need.” \n\nThe decision reflects the maturity of most major European source markets, the ease of connectivity between countries, and the volume of GTA’s business in the region, said a company statement. \n\nIts size and industry-standing means GTA is less reliant on annual meetings with large audiences to enhance the depth and quality of conversations that will help its business – and that of its partners – grow, it added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:36:58.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
