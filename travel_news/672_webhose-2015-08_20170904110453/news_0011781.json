Featuring the finest Craggy Range vintages and world-class cuisine created by One&Only Hayman Island’s talented chefs, each epicurean event will be hosted by Craggy Range ambassadors including Owners, Terry Peabody and Mary-Jeanne Hutchinson (nee Peabody) and Winemaker, Ben Mullen. When Terry Peabody visited New Zealand in 1997 and was introduced to Master of Wine Steve Smith, he sensed an exciting possibility in New Zealand, with the exceptional climate and spirit of the people. He went on to create one of the region’s great wineries and to produce wines that would become internationally regarded as New World classics, sourcing the best land in the country, and planting the vines perfectly suited to the soil and climate.\nWith seven exceptional restaurants and bars, and Australia’s best on-island cellar, One&Only Hayman Island is the perfect location for this exciting Craggy Range Series. Under Executive Chef Karim Hassene, who brings with him a wealth of culinary knowledge and expertise, most recently from One&Only Le Saint Géran, the resort celebrates Australia’s abundant fresh produce and cultural melting pot, bringing together so many of the world’s great cuisines.\nDuring Craggy Range Wine Month, the resort’s fine dining restaurant, Fire, will host a four-course degustation menu every evening paired with Craggy Range wines. On Saturdays, guests are invited to an exclusive Craggy Range Wine Tasting at Pacific, while watching the sun set against the stunning backdrop of the Coral Sea. The highlight event is the Craggy Range Chef’s Table Dinner which will take place on Friday evenings throughout September. Guests will dine in One&Only Hayman Island’s Main Kitchen, and enjoy an interactive gourmet experience led by Karim Hassene and his team of chefs.\n“I look forward to working with Ben and the team from Craggy Range to create exciting wine and food pairings,” commented Karim Hassene, Executive Chef of One&Only Hayman Island. “As a chef, I understand how much people enjoy great cuisine whilst drinking a glass of wine. Being able to pair our creations with some of the fantastic vintages that Craggy Range has to offer will definitely ensure that our guests are blown away.”\nOne&Only Hayman Island has established a new level of ultra-luxury in Australia, offering an unsurpassed level of style, choice and personalised exploration. Surrounded by astonishing natural beauty, it is a place of restorative peace, indulgence and adventure, where genuine hospitality is delivered and a vivid sense of energy is felt.\nGuests are invited to experience Craggy Range Wine Month at One&Only Hayman Island, with prices starting from AUD $1,170 (INR 56,000 approx.) per person, based on two people sharing.
