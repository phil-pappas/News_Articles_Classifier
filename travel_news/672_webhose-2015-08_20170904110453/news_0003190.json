The venue has appointed a number of AV technicians and created a new specialist technical and audio-visual department to service nine cloud based virtual meeting rooms within the venue. \nThe new virtual meeting rooms package offers RCP clients the opportunity to join a virtual meeting wherever they are in the world using a wide range of video-conference technology such as Skype or web browser, enabling communication between all delegates regardless of location. The technology will also include collaborative working facilities, enabling delegates to share desktop displays for the purpose of giving virtual presentations, workshops and online training. The RCP’s Technical & Audio-Visual Manager, Ben Pain says: “This is a fantastic service for clients who are finding it increasingly difficult to have all their prospective delegates in one room at the same time.” The Royal College of Physicians Sales and Marketing Manager Natacha Allen adds: “We’re delighted to be able to offer this level of service for our event clients; the development of the virtual meeting rooms and the AV department has come as a result of us adapting our offering to suit client needs. With many companies now having offices, employees and other stakeholders in different countries across the globe, we wanted to ensure we offer our clients a one-stop-shop type of service, ensuring that we have the right technology and a tech support team on-site to support their communications needs for any event.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:35:54.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
