(Saturday - Early morning) I read these two are part of nava narasimha temples in AP. Chennai to penchalakona is about 200kms. I see a dam - somasila near that place and waterfalls apart from the temple. Any other places of interest nearby? Is the temple reachable by car or need to climb hills / staircase? Penchalakona to Malakonda is about 160kms. Also I read Narasimha swamy temple at malakonda is open only on saturday. Is the temple reachable by car or need to climb hills / staircase? Also, planning for night halt at Nellore on saturday night. Any hotel - medium budget ? suggestions ? Back to chn on Sunday. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T23:19:04.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
