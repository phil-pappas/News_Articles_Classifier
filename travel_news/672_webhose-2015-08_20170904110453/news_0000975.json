This is an important safety feature.”\nA gravel trap, or run off area, is a gravel filled pit area strategically located on the racing track in a spot where vehicles are most likely to run off the track.\nMotorsport NT President Grant Hamon said Hidden Valley drag racing would work in conjunction with facilities management to ensure the appropriate standards and infrastructure were met.\n“We appreciate the fantastic support of the Government for motor sport across the Territory,” he said.\nHidden Valley Drag Racing Association President Scott Maclean said the gravel trap would be a fantastic addition to the facility.\n“This will be a major safety asset for the track,” he said. “Primarily it is all about no one having a serious accident and gives the cars the ability to stop more safely. As a not for profit association, we’re very pleased that the Government is helping us out with this, it’s awesome and we’re very grateful.”\nMr Maclean said apart from Zappia and Canulli, spectators should also keep an eye out for Darwin’s own Matt Abel.\n“Matt is our local hope – he’s a Darwin boy, he has the ability to do very well and the locals will all get behind him and it would be fantastic to see him win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:26:52.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
