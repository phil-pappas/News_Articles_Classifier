This time, communication between Google apps are updated to help us save time (and trouble) when planning our business trips or vacations. \nSpecifically, Google Calendar will now automatically extracts traveling information from relevant Gmail emails. The goal is to make a seamless experience (and to save you planning work). \n\" When an individual receives an email in Gmail with flight, hotel, restaurant, or ticketed event information, that event will be automatically added to their Google Calendar, complete with things like flight numbers and check-in times. Calendar will even update those events if plans change and a new email is received (for instance, when a flight is delayed or a reservation pushed back). \" Google \nUsers should receive a notification once the feature is activated. \nThe feature will be enabled by default. However, if you prefer to still handle such matters yourself (or think this kind of thing is creepy), you can disable it in the Calendar settings. \nGoogle says that the feature will launch in the coming weeks. Hit up the source link for more details. Are you glad to this see this integration with Google Calendar?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:13:21.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
