Italy's Big Three Travel Destinations \nEveryone knows them: Rome , Venice and Florence . While you're in Florence, you'll want to make your way to other destinations in Tuscany . One of the big mistakes travelers make is to try to see this triumvirate in 10 days. While you can certainly travel to each of them within ten days, you won't really get to experience any of the depth of these diverse and interesting places. If you only have a very short time, I'd recommend a tour--one that whisks you from place to place efficiently. You don't want to spend your time waiting for trains if you've only a short vacation. The fix is, of course, to ask for more vacation time. Even if you have to take it without pay, it'll cost you less to go once and see more than to go twice but see less each time. It's those fixed costs, the airline tickets and the jet lagged days lost, that get you in the end. \nLooking to hit the big Italian cities and the Island of Sicily? Try our Venice to Sicily Travel Itinerary . Don't Miss Italy's Smaller Cities and Rural Areas \nBut the Italian traveler shouldn't forget the smaller cities and rural places. The Italian region of Tuscany is popular, but it doesn't consist entirely of Florence and its suburbs. Think of Lucca or Sienna . Just a short trip down the train line is Pistoia . The Rural life in Tuscany can be relished in the Lunigiana , far northern Tuscany near the marble mountains of Massa and Cararra, where you can tour the marble quarries . You'll save money out there in the sticks; where a three course lunch with wine will only set you back 10 Euros at my favorite Lunigiana restaurant, Spino Fiorito . \nWe rented a beautiful and spacious apartment in Gravina in Puglia , right in the cathedral square, for a mere 56 euro in the spring. You won't see those kinds of prices in Rome. \nItaly's south is full of rural tourism opportunities. Try Puglia , see the Trulli and eat well. Each of the regions of Italy has its own charm; you can't go wrong picking one and exploring it. \nFor my money, the best way to explore the rural areas of Italy is by renting a vacation house or apartment in a rural area or small Italian city. HomeAway losts almost 20,000 rental properties in Italy . Accommodations in Italy \nItaly has a wide range of accommodations. There are usually abundant hotels near train stations, many budget, a few seedy. You may inspect a hotel before committing to it. \nThe hotels in Italy are rated by a government system that does not take into account the \"charm\" of a place. To understand this system, read Hotels and their Star Ratings--What do they Mean? \nMany travelers to Italy use a booking agent to find hotels. Hipmunk, a hotel price comparison engine, can show you the best rates on user-rated hotels in Italy. See prices for Rome , Florence or choose one and use the search for other cities. \nHave longer to stay in Italy? Renting a house or apartment for a week is an interesting option. See our article Self Catering - Vacation Home Rentals in Europe for more.
