However, while the overseas issues remain global growth looks muted so prompting the near-unanimous decision. \n“It would have been imprudent to push through a rate rise at this moment when our economic recovery remains in need of care and encouragement,” said John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \n“Rates will eventually have to rise and when they do, it should be done slowly and steadily. Until that moment, the Bank of England is right to keep interest rates at current levels.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:54:46.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
