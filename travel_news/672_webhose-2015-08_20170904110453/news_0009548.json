The hike will see walkers trek through natural labyrinths of rock towers and visit medieval and gothic castles as well as historic farmhouses and baroque châteaux. The trail also boasts tranquil lakes and meadows and offers walkers the chance to sample local wines, herbal liqueur and beer, for which the republic is famed. Other highlights of the journey include the ‘Museum of the Bohemian Paradise’ in Turnov which showcases the region’s rich and colourful history, allowing Australians to catch a glimpse of rural, middle Europe.\nThe hike is rated as easy to medium, with five to seven walking hours each day. The best months to walk are April to October. The package includes six nights’ accommodation, all breakfasts and luggage transfers – meaning walkers simply carry a day pack. 2016 walks will be cheaper than the 2015 price of £450 (approximately A$957, subject to exchange rate changes), twin-share, with the final price to be set in October. Single room supplements are available and extra nights in Prague at the end of the hike can be booked with On Foot Holidays.\nSource:- On Foot Holidays", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:06:03.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
