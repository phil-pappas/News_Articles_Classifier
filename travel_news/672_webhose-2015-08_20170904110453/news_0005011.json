Loss of balance is one of the more distressing symptoms, and sufferers often find themselves inexplicably on the floor. The final verdict on Cilla Black’s death is that she suffered a stroke after losing her balance, falling and hitting her head . The fall knocked her unconscious and a fatal stroke followed. But what, I wonder, caused her to lose her balance? The Spanish authorities believed it might have been something to do with the extreme heat - which it might well have been. But people with tinnitus can also experience dizzy spells that lead to falls. Tinnitus is common among rock stars and DJs and Eric Clapton , Phil Collins, Chris Martin of Coldplay and Liam Gallagher, formerly of Oasis , are known to be sufferers. But don’t imagine there is anything glamorous about the complaint. Coldplay's Chris Martin also suffers from tinnitus (Rex) Although often resulting from constant exposure to loud noise, tinnitus can just as frequently affect quiet little people like myself. I have lived with the condition for the past 10 years following a serious ear infection, and although I can cope, I can never now experience the blissful sound of silence. When everything goes quiet outside, the noises in my head become louder, or seem to. They are especially loud in bed at night, when the constant ringing, hissing and whooshing sounds can become intolerable. At times, I go completely deaf and have to go to the doctor for antibiotics. But even when I recover some hearing, the noises never go away. And I too, have suffered from dizzy spells and loss of balance, often falling down in the street as if I’m drunk. In some cases tinnitus can be so bad that it quite literally drives people to their death. On July 9 this year, 58 year old James Ivor Jones died by jumping into a quarry, leaving a note that he simply could not live with the pain of tinnitus any more. Although there is no cure or effective treatment on the horizon, tinnitus is finally being properly researched. Dr Roland Schaette, of University College London’s Ear Institute and a sufferer himself, is one of the UK’s leading tinnitus researchers. Tinnitus sufferers often hear loud noises (Alamy) He says: \"We now know that the condition develops when the hair cells of the brain become damaged, although we do not yet know what causes the damage and so far, nothing will reverse it. A normal auditory system will filter out the sounds that tinnitus sufferers hear inside their heads, so that the person is not aware of them.\" \"With tinnitus, this filtering system has gone permanently wrong. Our challenge is to try and find a way of enabling these cells to reconnect to the nerves. If we could only get the hair cells to regrow and reconnect, we would have a cure. The search is on to find a drug which will put a stop to the internal noises and pharmaceutical companies are now working on it.\" In the meantime, what can you do? The British Tinnitus Association and Action on Hearing Loss – formerly the Royal National Institute for the Deaf – have a number of factsheets explaining the condition and listing the devices available to try and make the noise bearable. You can get ‘relaxers’ - CDs with sounds like ocean surf, tropical rain, thunderstorms and country roads, to mask the hissing and roaring noises in your head but basically, all you can do is to learn to live with it and ‘manage’ the symptoms. In some cases, anti-depressants are prescribed as the condition can make sufferers truly suicidal. Liz has tried a variety of treaments to cure her tinnitus, including acupuncture (Jon Feingersh) I have tried acupuncture, to no effect whatever, herbal medicine ditto, and have even had whole-head X-rays to see if there is something serious there, like a brain tumour. All tests have revealed nothing, except that I am getting ever more hard of hearing. Telephone conversations in particular are becoming increasingly difficult to hear. And parties are agony. There is on the market a device known as Acoustic Co-Ordinated Reset , available at private tinnitus clinics, which claims to lessen the perception of sounds inside your head for up to two hours at a time. It is about the size of a matchbox and may reduce symptoms by up to 80 per cent. But at a cost of around £4,500, it’s an expensive way of finding temporary respite. And even the manufacturers say it does not work for everybody. Tinnitus is different from ordinary deafness, but it always causes a level of hearing loss. Possibly the most effective treatment so far is to get a hearing aid. These have made great progress in the past 10 years or so and when I went for a hearing test, this was what my audiologist recommended. She said that I should try an NHS hearing aid first and if that worked, proceed to one of the expensive barely detectable devices. So far my vanity is such that I have resisted, but the tinnitus is getting so bad that it may be my only salvation. Even if the noises in my head won’t go away, at least I may be able to hear.
