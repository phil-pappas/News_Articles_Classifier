The group were greeted with rays of sunshine, the choice of a complimentary glass of champagne or Bloody Mary cocktail, and invited to take in the views from the alfresco roof-top bar. \nShowcasing the light-bites on offer from the bar’s menu, cheese, meat and vegetarian sharing platters were laid on for the event attendees to enjoy. Introductory speeches followed shortly after, before the group was divided into two and taken aboard HMS Belfast for a whistle-stop tour of the ship. Upon returning to the bar, the Yelpers enjoyed a few more glasses of fizz before departure. Alex Shebar, Yelp London Community Director, said: “There are some spots in London that, no matter how fantastic, and how right in front of you they are, you continue to walk past and never explore. Sadly, the Upper Deck Bar was one of them. And it is a shame, since this beautiful bar is right on the river, has a breath taking view of both the HMS Belfast and Tower Bridge, and is staffed by some of the friendliest bartenders in London. “Well, we weren't going to stand for this anymore! Yelp is all about introducing people to those amazing hidden spots in their city and that's just what we did, and the event couldn't have gone better. We drank champagne and Bloody Mary's in the sun; toured and learnt about the ship; and had a fantastic morning in a spot that no one had been to before. But they'll be back again now for sure! Upper Deck Bar, you are hidden no longer.” Further feedback from the event attendees via Yelp London included: “This was simply the best start to a Saturday! The sun was beaming down on the upper deck bar and we enjoyed complimentary cocktails and champagne over a delicious buffet-style charcuterie. The view of Tower Bridge from the bar was pretty incredible too!” Steph A. “After waking past HMS Belfast more times than I care to remember, I finally got the opportunity to check it out. What can I say? The bar is a super cool venue for drinks while looking over the Thames. I had the pleasure of trying their coffee and can honestly say they serve the best mocha in London... Incredible!” Livi.S “…..Perfect mix of great atmosphere, slice of history wish a dash of champagne and fine cheeses. The rooftop terrace cafe was great for catching some rays and breathing in the fine buildings along the Thames. The boat was great for exploring an exquisite piece of history…..” Kate.F The Upper Deck Bar is open daily from noon until 11pm, weather permitting. Located just above the visitor entrance and Quayside Café (open daily from 9am-6pm) at HMS Belfast, the open-air bar seats up to 60 guests for food and drinks and is also available for private hire. With seating positioned along the perimeter of the bar, guests can enjoy the spectacular views of the ship and its surrounding landmarks whilst watching the sun set over London.
