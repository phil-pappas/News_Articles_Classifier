Opening in December, the new Park City ski area is a merger of what were formerly the Park City Mountain Resort and Canyons, interconnected with new lifts and trails. The behemoth will feature 38 lifts and 300-plus runs, including a chair and trail right down to the town’s historic Main Street — just a few blocks from the No Name Saloon. \nThe former silver mining town has long been a ski travel hot spot, but the seismic change will make already popular Main Street eateries like the No Name Saloon even harder to get into. But you need not wait until winter, as Park City has increasingly become a year-round destination, with plenty of great hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and other mountain town activities. A brand-new 18-hole public golf course just opened at the Canyons base area a month ago. Plus, it’s a lot easier to go out to eat, and when you do, you can eat outside. \nPark City is an upscale town, home to many luxury hotels, boutiques, art galleries and the Sundance Film Festival. It does not really have any dive bars, but the No Name Saloon is about as close as it gets. Entering it feels a bit like stepping back in time to the Old West, with a Victorian-style saloon featuring worn wooden floors, an ornate bar with multi-level shelves and mirrors, and old-school ceiling fans all driven by a single linked belt. Imagine a cowboy bar, with stools at the bar and a jumble of high-top tables jammed in as close together as possible for dining. Now imagine taking anything and everything the owners could find and hanging it on walls and from the ceiling — including Christmas lights, a tricycle, toy cars, a moose head, sports trophies and a full-size old motorcycle and a very old snowmobile. Bathrooms are marked with pictures of Popeye and Betty Boop. A flat-screen TV is jammed in among the miscellany, silently playing sports while loud music cranks — every second or third song is Led Zeppelin. \nThat’s the front bar cum dining room. The place is a bit of a maze that continues backwards past the narrow kitchen with more tables hidden in back, even more upstairs, and in summer, more outside. Everywhere you turn is interesting stuff, from well-used bar shuffleboard to old license plates to an antique high wheel bicycle. Just as there is little order to the layout and design, there is no order to the seating, and when busy it’s every guest for themselves, with hovering/stalking rewarded while less aggressive diners may never get seated. In peak ski season, it is easiest to come for lunch or après, while for dinner, expect a (potentially fruitless) wait. \nReason to visit: Buffalo burgers. \nThe food: The No Name Saloon is a bar, and it is all about bar food, served fast and on red-and-white checked paper in red plastic baskets. But it is very good bar food with several unique twists. Still, it would be somewhat unremarkable save for a confluence of highlights: its great location in arguably the nation’s hottest ski town, its century-plus of history and undeniably colorful atmosphere, and its focus on bison. \nBuffalo is increasingly common and for good reason: It tastes great, it’s likely better for you than beef and it is definitely more natural. While the vast majority of beef cattle in this country are raised on a steady diet of antibiotics, hormones and food they don’t consume naturally, bison receive no drugs and eat grass. It also happens to make a great-tasting burger, and I often use it at home. It shows up more and more on menus, but has been the signature here forever — so much so that the No Name Saloon offers no “regular” burgers. There are turkey and veggie alternatives, along with bar food staples like tacos, hot wings, quesadillas and fish and chips. \nThe burgers are served in several distinct styles, always with “buffalo chips and salsa,” which are actually very good house-made kettle-style potato chips, an unusual pairing. The potato chips and salsa are also offered as a starter and as a side can be upgraded to fries or onion rings, both of which are well above average. The fries are fresh and crunchy and really taste like potato, while the rings are the widely varied size that comes from cutting up actual onions rather than using a frozen bag, tasty and crispy. \nThe burger patties are an extremely generous 1/2-pound of bison, and since it has less fat to begin with, it shrinks less than a beef burger, making it seem even bigger. While they have the basic burger offerings, the house signature No Name Burger is unusual, topped with a mound of cream cheese studded with sliced jalapenos, plus lettuce, tomato and mayo spread underneath. I was hesitant to eat it, as I wouldn’t usually put cream cheese on a burger in lieu of say cheddar, but I tried it and it was excellent. The buffalo patty itself is really good, while the aioli, cream cheese and jalapeño worked well together. I also got to taste test a range of styles with the clever buffalo slider trio, and the barbecue bacon cheeseburger was my favorite. \nThere is something both homey and cheesy about the place. Service is frenetic but friendly, and given all that is going on and how dense the crowds they push through, I have to commend the wait staff on their non-stop smiles and attitude. It can be a bit of a chore to eat at No Name, especially for dinner on a busy night, but the food makes it worthwhile, better than it looks and better than you might expect. All this, plus lots of local craft beers on tap and a good happy hour make it what it wants to be: a great ski town bar. \nPilgrimage-worthy?: No, but if you are in Park City and want a great burger — or have never tried buffalo. \nRating: Mmmm (Scale: Blah, OK, Mmmm, Yum!, OMG!) \nPrice: $$ ($ cheap, $$ moderate, $$$ expensive) \nDetails: 447 Main Street, Park City, Utah; 435-649-6667; nonamesaloon.net \nLarry Olmsted has been writing about food and travel for more than 15 years.
