It would be no exaggeration to say we have been inundated with well wishers. \n“People who haven’t spoken to use for years have dropped a line to say congratulations.” \nFounder Darrell Wade agreed, adding: “We’ve had some independent agents ring us up and say we’d like to work with you right now.” \nHe added this can be seen in July alone when bookings for the operator, which are split between 55% direct sale and 45% via agents, rose by 32% through the trade. \nWade said: “It is probably the biggest growth period of our business. Since we’ve been independent we’ve contracted with a lot more independent businesses. It does remove some of those barriers.” \nEdwards added the operator is hoping to capitalise on the business boost with a fresh focus on independent agents with up to 700 being given the chance to experience Intrepid product through fam trips and holidays. \nHe said: “We just think that’s the next place for us to grow. Somebody needs to occupy that space.” \nWade also denied it was more expensive to secure a booking via an independent agent, arguing: “We are paying a bit of money (in commission) to agents but we know a direct client is more expensive.” \nElsewhere, Wade said Nepal was beginning to look positive again as the Annapurna region is given the green light by experts. However, the Himalayan region is yet to bounce back as question marks remain over its safety. \nEdwards said themed product is also performing strongly with bookings for food tours alone up 60% this year while sailing trips have seen a 30% boost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:01:57.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
