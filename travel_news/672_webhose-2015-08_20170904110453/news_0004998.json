Tomislav Salopek, 31, appeared in a video released by the Isil group, known as Sinai Province, on Wednesday. Kneeling at the feet of a knife-wielding militant, he said he would be killed in 48 hours if Egyptian authorities did not release female Muslim prisoners. Although it was not clear from when the countdown began, the deadline seems set to expire today. \"I am asking the people who hold my son to let him return to his family, because his motive to go to your homeland was exclusively to earn bread for his children. Nothing else,\" Mr Salopekâ€™s father, Zlatko, told AFP at the family home in the eastern Croatian town of Vrpolje on Friday. The hostage's father said that as his son was working for a French company, he was also looking to President Francois Hollande and the French authorities for help in securing his release. \"I thank France for what has been done so far and ask them to cooperate with Egyptian authorities to save my son,\" said Zlatko Salopek. Tomislav Salopek and his wife Natasa Mr Salopek, a father of two, is the first foreigner to be abducted and threatened with death by a group from the fragmented Islamist insurgency that gathered pace after the overthrow of Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi two years ago. He is understood to have been abducted in his car as it left Cairo on 22 July. The kidnapping underscored the extent of the challenge facing Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as his government struggles to contain the rising threat from Isil-linked groups and smaller, less radical cells of disaffected young men. When he was elected last year, Mr Sisi promised to restore security and economic prosperity to Egypt after four years of political turmoil. On Thursday, he promised to win the fight against the militants as he spoke at the opening of his ambitious pet project, a major extension to the Suez Canal. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T22:55:11.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
