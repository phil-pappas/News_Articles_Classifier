ACTA is a member driven organization and as such, feedback from you, its members, is important in understanding how it is performing. In addition, your participation will help ACTA evolve where necessary to ensure it is focusing on the priorities relevant to its membership base. This survey is intended for the owner, manager, decision maker or influencer within your ACTA member agency. The objective is to receive the feedback from those who make or influence the decision to invest in ACTA.\nAll of your answers will be gathered in a secure and confidential manner. An independent professional research company (NRG Research Group based in Winnipeg) is conducting the survey for ACTA and will ensure the methodological soundness of the research as well as guarantee respondent anonymity.\nThe survey will take less than 15 minutes of your time. If, while completing the survey you have to stop, you can simply exit the survey and close your browser. When you re-log onto the survey you will be brought to the point in the survey where you left off. Your previous answers will be preserved.\nAll ACTA members who complete the entire survey will have their name entered into a prize draw to win a round trip including air, transfers, and accomodation generously provided by our sponsor, VisitBritain .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T06:08:20.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
