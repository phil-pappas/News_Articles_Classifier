This comes after China Central Television (CCTV) posted an explanatory thread in response to an admission by an actress that she has frozen her eggs. With a video illustrating the pros and cons of having babies with the assistance of oocyte cryopreservation, or egg freezing technology, the post generated a huge response and attracted 109,442 reposts, 31,815 comments and 13,715 likes within two days of its publication. Egg freezing is classified as a supplementary IVF (in vitro fertilization) measure in China and the procedure is only available to married women who must have a valid reproduction permit, as stipulated by the Assisted Reproductive Technology Regulation issued by the National Health and Family Planning Commission, the country's top health body. Egg freezing technology is the only way for me to rectify my decision of not having babies now... The only exceptions are women with conditions such as premature ovarian failure, or those undergoing chemotherapy. Freezing eggs solely for preserving or extending fertility is considered illegal, according to the regulation. This reproductive technology has become the focus of public discussion partly because 41-year-old Xu Jinglei, a Chinese actress, announced about a month ago that she had frozen nine of her eggs in 2013 to give herself more opportunities to have babies at a later stage. \"Egg freezing technology is the only way for me to go back and rectify my decision of not having babies now if I later regret this decision,\" said Xu at the time. In response to CCTV’s post explaining China's denial of access to the technology to single women, Xu expressed her unhappiness at the move by sarcastically commenting: “Now there is a new creature in the world called Chinese single women.” Why is having a baby bound up with getting married? Her view found support in Han Han, an intellectual and bestselling author, who forwarded CCTV’s post and questioned whether a woman must get married before she can have a baby; whether a woman has the right to dispose of her own eggs freely; and whether she has the right to exercise her own reproduction rights. \"Why is having a baby bound up with getting married?\" asked Han. However, some experts claim that the reproductive technology poses health risks. The recovery rate of frozen eggs after thawing is 70 per cent to 80 per cent in contrast with the more mature technology of frozen embryos whose recovery rate is more than 95 per cent, said Sun Xiaoxi, a doctor at Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University. Frozen eggs may also leave uncertain effects on offspring, and the procedure of retrieving eggs may cause women complications such as haemorrhage, inflammation and ovarian function damage.
