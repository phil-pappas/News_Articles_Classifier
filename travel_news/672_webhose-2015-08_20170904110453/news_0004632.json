A treat for all gin lovers, the sunny gardens were packed full of brands showcasing their wares, with different tastes for ticket-holders to try. The smell of a barbecue wafted across the courtyard, and just around a corner, the Gardens' flamingos stretched their legs, watched by the crowd of gin lovers. Photo: Stefan Booth Inside the Tudor Garden masterclass tent, was Desmond Payne, the master distiller of Beefeater gin - the classic English gin, familiar to many of us. Payne has been in the business for 47 years, once at Plymouth Gin but for the last 20 years, at Beefeater. Photo: Stefan Booth \"The way I make gin is not the way anyone else really drinks in,\" he told us as we sipped our Fevertree elderflower tonic and Beefeater gin. \"Something or somebody always gets in the way. Often, it's tonic - gin and tonic, that wonderful marriage of tastes. The old cocktails from the 1920s are nearly all gin-based.\" But what did Payne teach his captive audience in the Tudor garden? Gin is versatile It mixes so well with other flavours because of the way that it is made You must have juniper Without juniper - it's not gin Photo: Stefan Booth It's open to suggestions Beyond juniper, you can put in any botanical you like You don't need to be a scientist to make it work Distilling gin is an art - not a science It's popular in Asia The biggest market in the world for gin is the Philippines - they produce \"something like 25 million cases of juniper-flavoured spirits a year\" It's good for fighting infection \"Juniper stops you getting the plague,\" Payne told us, to a giggle or two Happy gin-drinking!
