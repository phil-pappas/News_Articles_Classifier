It’s just the other side of the M62; not too far as the crow flies. But on your first day you realise you need to find an extra four hours in the day to fit in the commute. The truth is, most of us don’t know how many miles we travel to work “as the crow flies” but ask us door-to-door times and we trot them out almost too readily. Not any more. A couple of months ago iGeolise launched a tool in beta for jobseekers to search for new roles using commute time rather than miles. The tool is now also being used by recruiters looking for likely candidates. “Many location-based decisions are made using distance rather than by time,” says Charlie Davies, co-founder of iGeolise. “These decisions overlook that a mile can take five or 50 minutes depending on traffic, the time of day or mode of transport.” The company, which now has 17 employees (growing to 20 by the end of this year), began using technology to search maps for local content by time travelled, based on the idea that location-based decision-making can be more efficient, more relevant and more human. The Travel Time platform is now offered as a service to a range of companies, mostly in the property sector, working with the likes of Propertywide and Zoopla. Now this service has proved successful in the UK, iGeolise is working to internationalise, gathering data in France, the Netherlands and the US. “We’ve proved we can do this in the UK and we've enjoyed a nice period of success, but we’re not going to rest on our laurels,” Mr Davies says. “Our IT is three times as fast as it was last year. Speed is crucial to us. If a search takes seconds instead of milliseconds a user will get bored and go away. We have designed our system to cope with the scale and demand of modern-day apps.” Starting a business is hard work and keeping it going is even harder, he adds, but “loving what you do means staying up all night fixing something is fun, not horrible”. Mr Davies tries to apply this passion across the business and building the right team is crucial for him and his co-founder Peter Lilley. And for them, as with many young business enterprises in the collaboration economy, it is all about connection, so they offer short-term office space for fellow start-ups in London, introductions to experts and resources or just welcome ideas sessions with like-minded companies. “We were a start-up once,” Mr Davies says. “We were lucky. A lot of people helped us and we want to give something back.” The team is important to iGeolise and behind the software is a “funny, clever, committed and passionate” team of developers, as well as a wider network of friends and supporters. “I always say: ‘Don’t hire someone unless you have tried to do their job – otherwise you will not know what they need to do,” Mr Davies says with a laugh. “Your ideal team will eventually put you out of all the jobs you once did because no one else was there to do. You need to reach a point where you work on the business and not in the business.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • How Nideo turned viewers into customers • Breaking new markets means rethinking your SME • Efficient doctors need IT prescription • What is lean start-up philosophy? • Consider it signed, sealed and sent with Sendy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T20:38:05.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
