The board is expected to give 888 a grace period to make its own enhanced offer if it chooses GVC. ( http://thetim.es/1J5gf56 ) \nBwin was not available for comment. \nThe tussle for Bwin is the latest in a flurry of merger activity in the industry, a trend likely to continue as firms seek to expand to offset increasing taxes and tighter regulation in Britain. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Bwin were up 1 percent at 114.7 pence at midday on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) , while GVC was unchanged at 427.5 pence. \n($1 = 0.6390 pounds) (Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Maju Samuel)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T15:36:17.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
