Owning an aircraft may be your dream. You would be encountered with the desire to purchase an aircraft or a helicopter or to sell one. It would be beyond your area of expertise to work out all the details required to purchase or sales of the aircraft. It is here that you need the help of a company that has had years of experience in this field servicing customers like you. The company you choose must have a spotless reputation in this field.One of the primary tasks is to have the aircraft appraised. We need to know the market value of the aircraft. We also need to know other aspects like the depreciation index, market value, legal implications etc. Knowledge of the documentation required for purchase or sale of aircraft is also very important. It is here that the consultants, appraisers, brokers, aircraft inspectors, attorneys and CPA's of the company to whom you entrust the job of purchase or sales play a crucial role. We need to interview the company to whom we entrust the job thoroughly before we assign them the task of representing us.We may not have the liquid cash to purchase an aircraft. It is here that the company we associate must help us get the necessary financing. The company must have a good tie up with aircraft financing banks all around the world. They must be able to work out all aspects of credit and payment terms which would be suitable for us. Aircraft financing is a very specialized industry and the company that represents us must have unparalleled expertise in the area. Aspects like aircraft insurance must also be worked out by the company whom you contract with.If your goal is to sell the aircraft you would want to get the real worth of it. You would want to find a buyer who is ready to pay its real market worth. Finding such a buyer is not an easy task. The company with whom you associate must make your aircraft listed in a network of numerous sites intended for the same. They must do the task of mediating and negotiating with the buyers and find you the best deal for what the aircraft is worth. You may want to use your aircraft for commercial purposes like chartering or regular commercial flights. It is here that the aspect of aircraft management comes into the scene. There are a lot of details involved in this. We would need to hire the crew and ensure that they are adequately trained. Hangaring and maintenance is another important aspect. Fueling and catering are other aspects. The most important aspect is liability and risk management. Rather than having to deal with all the aches and pains of having to deal with these details it is best to outsource them.
