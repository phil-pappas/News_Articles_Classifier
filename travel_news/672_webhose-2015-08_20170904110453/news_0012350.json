IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LOOK UNDER 21, YOU MAY BE ASKED FOR PROOF OF IDENTITY. The way things are going, we could soon be seeing a new sign. IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER 65, YOU MAY BE ASKED TO LEAVE AFTER ONE GLASS OF WINE. Middle-class drinkers have been in the firing-line for so long that they have needed stiff gins to steady their nerves. Now it is the turn of a specific subsection of their number, the over-65s. If you believe the minatory headlines, those naughty Baby Boomers have not had a teetotal drink since their mother’s milk. The warnings to the over-65s to go easy on the hooch are based, as always, on impeccable research . Academics at King’s College London used the anonymised electronic GP health records of nearly 30,000 patients in the Borough of Lambeth to establish that 1 in 5 older drinkers were consuming alcohol at unsafe levels. Men, not surprisingly, were worse culprits than women, particularly the well-educated and reluctantly retired. As the son of a doctor, and with two daughters of my own in the medical profession, I would be the last person to pour cold water on the research, or downplay the risk of excessive alcoholic consumption. Chronic alcoholism is a disease, and needs monitoring . But where is the evidence on the other side of the ledger? 'Men, not surprisingly, were worse culprits than women, particularly the well-educated and reluctantly retired' Where is the academic research to show what we have all observed from personal experience – that a drink, or a cigarette, or even a drink AND a cigarette, can be like rays of sunshine in an older person’s day? That lonely pensioner popping into his local for a sundowner is not a pathetic figure: he is a normal human being. That raddled octogenarian with whisky on her breath is not a basket case: she is just getting through the day, and with a smile on her face. And where are the facts and figures to corroborate what people have known in their guts since ancient times – that drinking alcohol is not some depraved activity, to be outlawed, but one of life’s deepest pleasures, to be shared with loved ones? Why else would celebration and champagne be so inextricably linked? I turned sixty earlier this month and, to be absolutely honest, entered my seventh decade with a slight hangover . And it did not take a member of the Royal College of Physicians to discern the cause. I had consumed an entire bottle of bubbly single-handed in my kitchen the previous afternoon. ‘Disgraceful!’ cry the health vigilantes. ‘The man sounds like a cross between Dylan Thomas and Oliver Reed.’ What the vigilantes fail to appreciate is that, on the day in question, the eve of my birthday, I had been glued to the television, watching England bowl out Australia for 60 at Trent Bridge. Before lunch! On the first morning of an Ashes Test! 'Generally speaking, like a lot of men of my generation, I drank less in my fifties than I did in my forties and, from what I can remember of my student days, a fraction of what I did in my twenties' Photo: Image Source/Alamy If that was not a cue to open the bubbly, I would like to know what it is. It was a stupendous passage of play, pure cricketing Viagra . Was I just supposed to raise a glass of milky tea to the England team? And I had to knock back the bubbly on my own, before my wife came home from work, because my wife, through no fault of her own, is Australian. What was a man of tact and discretion supposed to do? Case dismissed! Generally speaking, like a lot of men of my generation, I drank less in my fifties than I did in my forties and, from what I can remember of my student days, a fraction of what I did in my twenties. So those health warnings have not fallen on totally deaf ears. And, unless England make a habit of bowling out Australia for 60, I will probably consume less alcohol in my sixties and seventies than I did in my fifties. To my daughters and their friends, members of the uber-health conscious generation for whom a glass of wine at lunchtime is the Eighth Deadly Sin , my lifestyle will probably still leave something to be desired. But the point about old age is that it confers, not wisdom exactly, but a sense of perspective. Those over-65 topers in Lambeth know that, thanks to advances in medical science, they enjoy far higher life expectancy than their parents. They know that, if they watch their health like hawks, and follow every last edict from the NHS, they can live another thirty years or more. And they also know, because they are not fools, that if they hit the bottle morning, noon and night, they will drink themselves into an early grave. But probably the most important thing they know, through long experience, is that there is a sensible middle way. People can be moderately healthy AND moderately self-indulgent: it is not a binary choice between two extremes. And if their self-indulgence sometimes takes liquid form, and goes on till three in the morning, only the worst kind of puritan would throw up their hands in horror. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T19:39:57.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
