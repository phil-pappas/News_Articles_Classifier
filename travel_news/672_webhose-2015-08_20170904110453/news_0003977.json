Float builder, Phoenix Decorating Company, conducted a first test-run of the float to see how it performs on the street.\n“This will be the first time the South Dakota float will see the light of day, and we’re very excited to see how it performs and how the public reacts to it,” said Jim Hagen, Secretary of the Department of Tourism. “There is still much work to do, but the Phoenix team has done an exceptional job to this point, and we look forward to seeing the finished product.”\nThis first test run is necessary in order to be sure everything is operating properly. Another test run will take place in early September.\n“The elements chosen to be featured on the float were based on several factors. First was the theme of the 2016 Rose Parade, which is a salute to the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service,” said Hagen. “Elements were also chosen in order to give people an overview of the variety of what South Dakota has to offer. You’ll see a nod to our agricultural economy, Native American culture, and some of our iconic wildlife.”\nThe theme of the 2016 Rose Parade is “Find Your Adventure.” This theme has grown out of a partnership between the Pasadena Tournament of Roses and the U.S. National Park Service, and will help shine a light on the centennial celebration of our country’s national parks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T12:22:16.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
