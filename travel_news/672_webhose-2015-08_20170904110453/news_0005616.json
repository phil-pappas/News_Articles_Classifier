Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 13, 2015 Banners   \nEmirates airline has just announced the launch of flights from Dubai to Panama, their first destination in Central America. Covering the distance of 13,821 kilometers nonstop in a Boeing B777-200LR will take a flying time of 17 hours and 35 minutes, the longest commercial flight when it will take off on February 1 next year. \nThis will be the first ever connection to Panama City by any of the Gulf carriers and reflects Emirates’ relentless drive to connect the world out of Dubai. Panama is commercially important due to the Panama Canal, which is the country’s best-known feature and as such attracts a steady flow of shipping executives, traders, and other business professionals, besides a growing number of tourists. \nPresently, Emirates serves the South American cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Buenos Aires. Emirates presently serves the East African airports of Entebbe – once a day – as well as Nairobi and Dar es Salaam – twice a day. \nIn a related development it was also learned that Emirates is in the final stages to reveal their new First Class product, which is expected to be launched early next year and will make its way first into the airline’s flagship aircraft, the Airbus A380 before being fitted into new B777 deliveries and retrofitted into the existing B777 fleet. \nThe aircraft from Dubai to Panama is configured with 8 suites in First Class, 42 fully flatbed seats in Business Class, and 216 seats in Economy Class. Additionally, the aircraft can uplift some 15 tons of cargo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:45:57.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
