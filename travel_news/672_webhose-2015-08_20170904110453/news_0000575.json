Here are some essential tips before you hit the river. \nEnergetic adventure activity holidays are becoming ever more popular as the world is discovering just how much more there is to a family break than lying on a beach eating ice-cream for a week in the summer. Among the huge range of activities on offer, white water rafting is an experience that the entire family can enjoy – depending, of course, on the grade of river. \nIf you travel with a reputable adventure holiday company, all the safety aspects of this exciting activity will be taken care of, but for those who may be slightly apprehensive about their first experience (especially with children), knowing a few basic tips and precautions may help set your mind at rest.Personal Safety is Paramount \nOne of the best things about white water rafting is you get all the thrill of the spill without the risk of other adrenaline-heavy activities like bungee jumping or skydiving. Your guide will take you through some basis precautions and show you how to swim with the current and float on your back, for instance. But even though the guide will take care of the nuts and bolts of keeping your group safe on the river, there are some more practical considerations that you can prepare for to ensure your experience is as stress-free and fun as it should be.Don’t Overestimate Your Skills \nRapids are graded from 1-5, with 1 being the easiest and 5 the most challenging. Don’t jump in to a grade 5 river for your first experience – take it slowly and try out some gentler rivers before even considering anything on the harder end of the scale. There are plenty of rivers that are suitable for beginners and families, like the wonderful River Dranse, in France. The Dranse is graded 1-3 and is quite popular for family activity holidays, with a combination of low waves, smallish rapids and gentler currents. \nDress Appropriately \nWhite water rafting activity holidays are not the time to parade around in a bikini and expensive rock star sunglasses. You need to dress for comfort and practicability over style. Quick drying (synthetic fibre-based) t-shirts and shorts are your best bet, along with some water shoes if you have them. Flip flops are not recommended, as you'll probably lose them within the first five minutes. \nLather on the Sunscreen \nJust because you'll be wet doesn't mean you won't be getting burnt. The main parts you need to protect are your face, shoulders and the tops of your thighs. Apply plenty of sunscreen and reapply throughout the day – especially if you get a good dunking. \nProper Safety Gear \nWhile you might not look glamorous in a helmet and life vest, they are both essential safety items – and don't worry, everyone else is going to look just as silly as you. It's important children are made aware of the importance of keeping their lifejacket on, not just in terms of buoyancy, but they also give something to grip on to when they're being hauled back into the boat. \nFor those lucky enough to be planning to set off on one of the family adventure activity holidays involving white water rafting, the last piece of advice is perhaps the most important: immerse yourself fully in the experience! Expect to get wet, expect to have sore shoulders, and expect to spend a lot of time upside down in a cold river – but, after all, those things are what make it so much fun.
