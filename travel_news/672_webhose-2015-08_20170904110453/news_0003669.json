That time has come with the acquisition of a substantial facility at CVG. This facility can simultaneously accommodate up to five CRJ-900 aircraft and will be capable of supporting the level of maintenance presently being accomplished at our DAY, CAK, and CLT Maintenance Bases. Furthermore, we are excited about the very bright future this holds for our employees and our operation.”\nConsequentially, PSA is seeking maintenance professionals in CVG to fill Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) Maintenance Technician, Stores Clerk, Supervisor, and Managerial positions.\nSource:- PSA Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:15:09.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
