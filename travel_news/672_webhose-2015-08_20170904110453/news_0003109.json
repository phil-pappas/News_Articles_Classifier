Its new package, dubbed “The Works,” will allow fliers to pay between $49 and $69 more for a one-way ticket and get both a carry-on and a checked bag in return, as well as priority boarding, a promise that they will not pay change fees, full refunds of their tickets up to 24 hours before the scheduled departure and the best available seat. Its purchase also guarantees that a carry-on bag will be accommodated in the plane’s cabin. In April 2014, the Denver-headquartered airline announced its full transition to a ULCC, dropping ticket prices significantly but adding fees for traditionally free services such as seat selection, carry-on bags and non-alcoholic beverages. With the change, the company became profitable for the first time in 11 years, but it also alienated scores of long-time fliers. Rather than portraying the introduction of The Works as a backing away from this new ULCC model, Frontier president Barry Biffle called the new service another option that is designed to attract those customers who are not happy or comfortable with the ULCC model. “Un-bundling has lowered fares for millions of fliers, but some want it all for one low price, and The Works gives them that choice,” Biffle said. “No one else offers this many features for such a low price, and our new carry-on guarantee ends bag separation anxiety.” With the single additional price to their ticket, customers receive a number of services for which they now are paying separately, including the opportunity to choose seats in stretch and exit rows. The package does not include any food or beverage items. Company officials are pitching the package as a way for them to remain below competitors in overall pricing. While customers could add as much as $69 to a direct one-way ticket with The Works — or $57 to $83 for connecting flights — the up-charges are less than those of other airlines that tack on a $200 change fee or $125 addition for more legroom, company officials touted. The move comes even as Frontier leaders have defended the changes to their business model in the face of industry-high complaint rates, largely surrounding problems with new reservation and customer-service systems, and decreasing Denver-based business over the past year. After holding as much as a 20 percent share of Denver International Airport passengers in years past, Frontier fell to just 8.8 percent in June, as it has eliminated many unprofitable routes through DIA and has concentrated on growing in new markets from Cleveland to Philadelphia where low-cost service is limited. The new program is one more example of Frontier’s continued efforts to find the right pricing model after being purchased in November 2013 by Phoenix-based private-equity firm Indigo Partners LLC. Biffle told the Denver Business Journal that while people may have liked the airline’s former business model, it was not sustainable any longer. It had to reduce benefits for its frequent-flier program, for example, because the previous iteration was structured in a way that Frontier lost $20 on every flight that one of its members took. \nWant Denver Travel   Business Pulse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:51:20.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
