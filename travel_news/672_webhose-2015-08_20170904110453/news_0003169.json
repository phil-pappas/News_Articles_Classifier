Yuri Cortéz/AFP \nMEXICO CITY – Mexico City was once seen as an island of refuge in one of the world’s most dangerous countries for reporters, but the brutal killing of a prominent photojournalist along with four other people has shattered that image. \nThe death of news photographer Rubén Espinosa in an awful five-victim homicide has unleashed new fears for other journalists who, like him, have fled to the capital after receiving threats in their hometowns. \nThere are currently at least a dozen journalists from around the country sheltering in Mexico City because they fear for their safety in a nation where, according to Reporters Without Borders, at least 88 of their colleagues have been murdered in the last 15 years. \nRelatives and friends of murdered Mexican photographer Rubén Espinosa mourn at the Dolores Cemetery in Mexico City, on Aug. 3, 2015. Alfredo Estrella/AFP \nOnce seen as a sort of ceasefire zone — or at least a place to hide out anonymously amid nine million people — Mexico City suddenly seems a lot less safe since Espinosa was found Friday with a bullet through his head, his hands bound and his body showing signs of torture. \nFour women killed alongside Espinosa were found in similar condition. They included human rights activist, anthropologist and dance company producer Nadia Vera Pérez, who was sexually abused and tortured before she was killed. Just eight months ago, in a video interview with Rompeviento TV , Vera chillingly told her interviewers that if anything happened to her, members of her family, or members of her fellow activist collective, she held Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte and his “entire Cabinet” responsible. \n“We want to be very clear: Our security is entirely the responsibility of the state, because it is precisely they who are ordering our repression,” Vera, who was a member of the group #YoSoy132 in Xalapa, told her interviewers, who described her as extremely anxious and nervous during the filming. \nJudicial authorities released surveillance footage of the alleged killers Tuesday night. \n“This was the armored city, and now it’s broken,” said a colleague at Espinosa’s funeral Monday who, like the slain photojournalist, hails from Veracruz. \nThe eastern state has been described as the deadliest in Mexico for journalists by rights group Article 19 , which says 17 journalists have been killed there in the last 15 years — 13 of them since current Governor Duarte came to power in 2010. In 2014 @article19mex documented 41 attacks against the press in Veracruz, the most dangerous state for journalism https://t.co/u1EYMibuWO \n— ARTICLE 19 (@article19org) August 4, 2015 \n‘No kind of life’ \nEspinosa, a photographer for the prestigious investigative magazine Proceso , had moved to Mexico City two months ago after receiving threats in Veracruz. \nHe had also been beaten by state police in 2013. \nAnother Veracruz colleague sheltering in the capital said Espinosa’s killing had brought his old hometown fears back to his doorstep. \n“After what happened to Rubén, your fear returns. We exiles don’t feel so safe among the multitude anymore,” said the political cartoonist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe cartoonist fled the state in 2012 after finding a threatening note in his car. “ Calladito ,” it said —“Quiet.” \nThat one word chilled his blood and convinced him to flee the country, he said. But he later returned to Mexico, counting on the sheer size of the sprawling capital to keep him safe. \nLiving in self-exile is “no kind of life,” he told AFP. \n“It’s a life of constant anguish, nightmares, crying. It’s a life of not telling people where you are, not arriving where you say you will, changing your phone number, mistrusting everyone, even your friends,” he said. \nCurrently around 15 Mexican journalists are reported to be living in self-exile abroad. \nThe number of colleagues seeking to join them has increased substantially in recent years, said Philippe Olle-Laprune, the head of the Citlaltepetl House of Refuge in Mexico City, which shelters persecuted journalists and artists from around the world. \nHe called Espinosa’s killing “a horrible wakeup call,” adding that “the violence hits closer to home every day.” ¿En qué país se escapa el narco # 1, matan 43 estudiantes en Iguala y 15 periodistas de Veracruz, descubren Casa Blanca…y nadie renuncia? \n— JORGE RAMOS (@jorgeramosnews) August 4, 2015 \n‘Flimsy’ protection \nThe Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Mexico the eighth deadliest country in the world for reporters. \nSeeking to combat the violence, the government has launched a protection program for threatened journalists and rights activists, plus a special prosecutors’ office for crimes against free speech. \nBut one former journalist enrolled in the so-called “protective mechanism,” Balbina Flores, said the program “has a lot of problems,” particularly its slow registration procedures. \nThe Inter American Press Association agreed, criticizing the program’s “flimsy, inefficient performance.” \nEspinosa had opted not to register with the program, saying he did not trust the authorities. \nHis death has left journalists in the capital living in a climate of “fear, uncertainty and defenselessness,” said Flores, who now heads the free-speech program at the city’s human rights commission. \nColleagues of murdered Mexican photographer Rubén Espinosa place their cameras beside his grave.
