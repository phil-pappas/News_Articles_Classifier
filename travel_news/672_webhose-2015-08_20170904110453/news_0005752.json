But in their business model, those things have to be packaged up as an administration fee or booking fee. \n\n“Effectively, what we are giving on the platform is their own app, co-branded with Luxe, without having to invest in their own proprietary software,” Westcott added. \n\n\nLuxe Concierge is now in soft launch phase and available on Android and iOS mobile devices. The official launch will take place at Luxperience in Sydney from September 6 to 9, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:37:01.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
