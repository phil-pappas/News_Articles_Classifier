Don’t tell me it’s a freaking straw.”\nThe woman filming is Christine Figgener , a second year marine biology PhD student at Texas A&M University. Her colleague with the pliers is Nathan J. Robinson , a post-doctoral fellow at Indiana-Purdue University.\nThey soon determine that it is, indeed, a straw.\nFinally, after nearly eight painful minutes of pulling on the end of the straw, it comes loose. It’s a full-length drinking straw — 10 to 12 centimeters long, Figgener wrote in the description of her YouTube video.\nShe said the turtle likely ingested the straw and then puked it up out of the wrong passageway.\n“The nasal cavity of sea turtles is connected directly to the palate (roof of the mouth) by a long nasopharyngeal duct,” Figgener wrote.\nThe turtle was OK, as far as the researchers know. Figgener wrote that the bleeding stopped almost immediately after removing the straw. She said they treated the nasal passage with iodine and later released the patient back into the ocean.\nFreakin’ plastic\nThe number of F-bombs Figgener drops throughout the video — most of them after she finds out the turtle is a victim of our ubiquitous plastic trash problem — is indicative of her feelings on the subject.\nThe YouTube video of the straw removal had been viewed more than 3.3 million times by Tuesday morning, August 18. After viewers asked how they could help, Figgener started a GoFundMe campaign to support her sea turtle research.\nFiggener plans to spend at least some of the cash on developing a sea turtle first aid kit, according to a Tuesday update on the fundraising site.\n“The first aid kit would be for cases like ours where a sea turtle is found with injuries or foreign objects attached to them, such as fishing hooks or fishing line or -as in in our case – a straw, and medical attention is unavailable or too far away,” Figgener wrote on the site.\nIn the first four days of the fundraising campaign, at the time of this publication, 160 people had donated a total of $3,267. The goal is $200,000.\nClick here to donate to Figgener’s campaign.", "external_links": ["http://ocean.tamu.edu/people/students/figgenerchristine.html", "http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~robinsn/Nathan_Robinson/Welcome.html", "http://www.gofundme.com/wuhvd6zj", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wH878t78bw?start=152&#038;feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-08-19T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:01:30.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
