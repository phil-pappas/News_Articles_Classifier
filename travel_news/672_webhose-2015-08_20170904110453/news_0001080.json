(“The ONE Group”) (NASDAQ:STKS), today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nHighlights for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 were as follows: The second quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth; Owned unit net revenues increased 26.2% to $12.8 million; Total GAAP revenue increased 21.5% to $14.9 million; Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units* increased 7.5% to $36.7 million; Management and incentive fee revenues were $2.1 million for the quarter; GAAP net income for the quarter was $8.4 million, or $0.34 per share, and included a one-time reversal of a deferred tax allowance of approximately $6.2 million; Adjusted EBITDA was $1.63 million compared to $1.65 million for the same period last year**; and Opened STK at the ME Milan IL Duca and commenced the hotel’s food & beverage services, and opened STK at the W Hotel West Beverly Hills in Los Angeles, California. \n*Total food and beverage sales at owned and managed units, a non-GAAP measure, represents our total revenue from our owned operations as well as the revenue reported to us with respect to sales at our managed locations, where we earn management and incentive fees at these locations. For a reconciliation of our GAAP revenue to total food and beverage sales at our owned and managed units and a discussion of why we consider it useful, see the financial information accompanying this release. \n** Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment loss, deferred rent, pre-opening expenses, non-recurring gains and losses, stock based compensation and losses from discontinued operations. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP and a discussion of why we consider it useful, see the financial information accompanying this release. \nJonathan Segal, CEO of The ONE Group said, “The second quarter marked our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth. During the quarter we began operating the food and beverage services at the ME Milan including an STK Restaurant and Radio Milan, a rooftop bar. Additionally, we opened an STK in the W Hotel in West Beverly Hills, California to accompany the hotel food and beverage we had been operating at the property since October.” \nSegal continued, “We are also very excited about our proposed acquisition to acquire the restaurant brands Katsuya and Cleo as we expect that it will be transformative to our company and immediately accretive to earnings. These are high volume profitable brands with a significant licensing business similar to our hospitality business. They are complementary to our existing brands existing in markets we currently operate in, as well as additive to our growth, as it will open up geographic expansion into the Middle East. We will be able to assume the new operations without any increase in our general and administrative expenses by leveraging the management infrastructure we have invested in globally. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to build sustainable growth which we expect will enhance shareholder value over time.” \nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results \nTotal owned unit net revenues increased 26.2% to $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $10.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to the re-opening of our STK in Miami and the food and beverage services at the W Hotel in West Beverly Hills. Comparable sales from owned STK units increased 2.7% for the quarter. Comparable sales from owned and managed STK units increased 3.1% for the quarter after excluding the sales from the STK in London which was closed for several days due to a power failure that affected the entire hotel as well as the surrounding area. \nManagement and incentive fee revenues were $2.12 million in the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of 1.0% compared to $2.14 million in the prior year’s quarter. The decrease was driven by the decline in revenue from our UK operations due to the change in exchange rates versus the same period a year ago. Offsetting this was an increase in management and incentive fee income earned from the STK in Las Vegas. \nTotal food and beverage sales at owned and managed units increased 7.5% to $36.7 million compared to $34.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. \nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 was $1.63 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.65 million in the second quarter of 2014. \nIn the second quarter of 2015, we reported a net income attributable to The ONE Group of $8.4 million compared to a net income of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. Net income in 2015 included a one-time reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance of approximately $6.2 million. \nAdjusted net loss for the quarter was $721,000, or $0.03 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $707,000, or $0.03 per share, in the second quarter of 2014. \nDevelopment Update \nIn May 2015 we launched the food and beverage services for the new ME Milan IL Duca hotel, including Radio Milan, a rooftop restaurant, and on May 11, we opened our second European STK location at this hotel. Additionally, on June 29, we opened an STK restaurant at the W Hotel in West Beverly Hills in addition to operating the W Lounge, along with other food and beverage services at the hotel. We will be shortly opening a new pool side restaurant for the hotel.
