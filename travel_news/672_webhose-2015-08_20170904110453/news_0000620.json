It added that passengers can now “complete reassurance”that their travel pland will not be disrupted this summer.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-03T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:28:16.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
