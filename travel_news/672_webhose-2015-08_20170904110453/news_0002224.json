The company at the time said it plans to have more than 4,500 employees there.\nThe campus now has six buildings and a parking garage, totaling 670,834 gross square feet and 1,230 parking spaces, Expedia said. In April, Expedia said it planned to build an additional 200,000 square feet of space.\nMost Read Stories ESPN video: Percy Harvin opens up about what went wrong in Seattle Amazon angst: from traffic to housing, we’re all worked up It’s election time.

The company would add between five and six new buildings, including a new parking garage.\nExpedia will begin a master-planning process required by the city for large tracts of land to evaluate its needs through 2030.\nThe planning process will include looking at the impact of the campus’ growth on the environment and traffic, the company said.\nThe company said it isn’t seeking to change the current 65-foot height limit on the property, or the 100-foot view corridor at West Prospect Street. It also plans to preserve public access that exists now along the waterfront.\nSanjay Bhatt: 206-464-3103 or sbhatt@seattletimes.com On Twitter @sbhatt", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/sbhatt"], "published": "2015-08-06T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T01:44:45.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
