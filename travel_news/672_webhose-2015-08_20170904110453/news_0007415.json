One participant, Paul Shannon, took $1000 for capturing the largest python during the time period, measuring a whopping 14 ft. 3 in.\nThe greatest number captured was won by Brian Barrows, who managed to get six Burmese pythons.\nNext year's event will include training events for those who get involved, including teaching registered participants how to identify and capture pythons.\nWildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron carries a machet in search for pythons on an island in the everglades\nParticipants can sign up to the Python Challenge as part of a team of up to five, or individually, and aim to capture the largest length pythons, or the greatest number in total\nPark Superintendent Pedro Ramos said in a statement that authorities hope the expanded access prompts more people to participate in programs that would allow them to remove pythons year-round from the park and state lands.\nState wildlife commissioner Ron Bergeron said officials hope the hunt increases python sightings and removals in the wetlands.\nNo one is quite sure how many of the non-native species live in the Everglades but estimates have ranged up to 100,000 animals.\nThough the final body count for the Python Challenge was fairly small, organisers say they were very happy with the outcome of the last hunt.\nThe hunt will take place during January 16 – February 14, 2016, with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission working with several state and federal land management agencies to provide land for the operation\nThe last event was held in 2013, and the lure of cash prizes drew 1,600 participants who netted 68 pythons\n'Thanks to the determination of Python Challenge competitors, we are able to gather invaluable information that will help refine and focus combined efforts to control pythons in the Everglades,' Florida wildlife commission executive director Nick Wiley told CNN .\nAs well as culling South Florida’s population of the invasive snakes, the purpose of the hunt was also to raise awareness about non-native species and their detrimental effects on the local ecosystem.\nThe pythons can grow up to 18 feet in length, and due to having no natural predators, they can eat anything in their way and reproduce in large numbers.\nThe recommended method for killing pythons is a gunshot to the brain, or decapitation to reduce the threat. (The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals doesn't approve of the latter method, though.)\nFlorida currently prohibits possession or sale of the pythons for use as pets, and federal law bans the importation and interstate sale of the species.\nWildlife experts say pythons are just the tip of the invasive species iceberg.\nFlorida is home to more exotic species of amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world, said John Hayes, dean of research for the University of Florida's Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences.\nWHAT HAPPENS TO THE PYTHONS? Once hunters kill a python, usually with a gunshot to the brain, they turn the specimen over to officials at designated check stations where researchers gather biological information in the hopes of learning how to better combat the quickly reproducing species.\nLast time some hunters retrieved their snake and took it to Exotic Leather Goods, where up to $150 was paid for the best specimens.\nFrom there, the pythons were skinned, and some dyed, while others were left with their natural brownish colours - and then the skins were turned into high fashion.\nNo one is quite sure how many of the non-native species live in the Everglades but estimates have ranged up to 100,000 animals\nRead more: Plenty more where those came from -- final take in Fla. snake hunt is 68 pythons - CNN.com 2016 Python Challenge™", "external_links": ["http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/16/us/florida-python-hunt/index.html?hpt=hp_t3", "http://dailym.ai/1LipHmg", "http://www.pythonchallenge.org/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-19T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:00:35.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
