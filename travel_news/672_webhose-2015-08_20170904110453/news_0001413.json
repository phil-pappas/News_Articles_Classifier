The record states: 'Pax witnessed bag moving and alerted airline staff in baggage area who alerted Border Force.'\nThe owner was separated from the four-week old kitten, which was placed in quarantine to guard against infectious diseases.\nThe log reads: 'Pax refused to be separated from kitten and claimed to have appropriate documentation, however this was in their hold luggage which did not make it to the destination and was being traced.'\nPassengers noticed something moving about in someone's luggage at Glasgow International Airport\nPhilip Baum, editor of Aviation Security International, said: 'While a cat is not considered a prohibited item in the same way as a weapon or narcotics it would definitely show on an X-ray machine. You have to wonder what on earth the operator was doing at the time if he didn't see the animal going through.\n'The other possibility is that the animal did not pass through security in a bag and was found airside which has happened before.'\nThe incident was recorded in logs detailing disruptive passengers released under the Freedom of Information Act. The airline was not named.\nCats entering the UK require a microchip, rabies vaccination and pet passport and must enter via an approved transport company and route.\nHeraklion Airport did not respond to requests for comment.\nA spokesman for Renfrewshire Council confirmed an environmental health officer attended the airport.\nHe said. 'The council did not ask for the kitten to be destroyed but I have no record of what happened to it. It could have been taken back to the country of origin.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ON9Xsd"], "published": "2015-08-04T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:25:03.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
