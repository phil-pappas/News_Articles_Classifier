(ACE) announced today its results for the second quarter of 2015.\n2015 Second Quarter Results\nIn the second quarter of 2015, ACE recorded a decrease in net assets in liquidation of approximately $115 million as a result of the distribution to the shareholders of ACE in the aggregate amount of $115 million which was paid on June 2, 2015 . Income for the quarter was approximately $24,000 , as a result of interest income earned during the quarter offset by administrative and other expenses.\nAs at August 28, 2015 , ACE's only remaining assets consist of cash in an aggregate amount of approximately $19 million.\nLiquidation Process and Interim Distribution to Shareholders\nOn June 28, 2012 , further to the approval by ACE shareholders on April 25, 2012 of a special resolution providing for the voluntary liquidation of ACE, the Superior Court of Qu√©bec (Commercial Division) (the \" Court \") issued an order appointing Ernst & Young Inc. as liquidator of ACE (the \" Liquidator \").\nPursuant to an order issued by the Court on February 25, 2013 , the Liquidator established a process for the identification, resolution and barring of claims and other contingent liabilities against ACE. Creditors had until May 13, 2013 to file their proof of claims, failing which their claims would be barred and extinguished. The interim consolidated financial statements of ACE for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 and the related management's discussion and analysis include a description of proofs of claim which were filed and the status thereof.\nGiven the results of the claims process and the expiry of a significant portion of the contingent obligations covered by proofs of claims filed in such process, the Liquidator announced on April 28, 2015 that it intended to seek Court approval for a distribution to shareholders of ACE in the aggregate amount of $115 million , or approximately $3.54 per common share of ACE. The Court approved such distribution at a hearing held on May 8, 2015 . The record date to determine shareholders entitled to receive the distribution was May 26, 2015 and the payment of the distribution was completed on June 2, 2015 .\nFuture distributions of ACE's remaining net cash to its shareholders are subject to the expiration or settlement of any contingencies and there is no certainty as to the timing or amount of such distributions. The final distribution to shareholders and the cancellation of the shares of ACE will not occur until all remaining contingent liabilities are settled or otherwise provided for.\nThe distribution paid on June 2, 2015 was, and any additional distributions will be, designated as eligible dividends for the purposes of the Income Tax Act ( Canada ).\nFor additional information with respect to the liquidation of ACE, refer to the management proxy circular dated March 9, 2012 , the interim consolidated financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis for the six-month period ended June 30, 2015 and the other public filings of ACE which are available at www.sedar.com and www.aceaviation.com .\nCAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nCertain statements in this news release may contain forward-looking statements.
