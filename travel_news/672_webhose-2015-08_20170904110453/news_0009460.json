The book will have details about his professional and personal life. We want everyone to know about the great work he has done as an actor, and how he was in real life,” Shadaab says.In his career spanning nearly two decades, Amjad Khan has worked in over 130 films, but is best remembered for his portrayal of ­villain Gabbar in 1975 cult, Sholay. \nHis other prominent films include Kalia, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Yaarana, Barsaat Ki Ek Raat, Saugandh, Hum Kisise Kam Nahin and Naseeb. With a trend of ­biopics made in the film industry in the recent past, Shadaab says he wasn’t sure if he would allow anyone to make a biopic on his father. \n“No one has approached me yet for the biopic. Whenever it happens we will see,” says Shadaab, who made his acting debut alongside Rani Mukerji in Raja Ki Aayegi Baaraat (1997). He adds that he is proud of his father’s achievements. \n“He was a strong ­performer ... he did many landmark films. In real life, he was a very down-to-earth person. He taught us to stay humble in life,” says Shadaab.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:49:56.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
