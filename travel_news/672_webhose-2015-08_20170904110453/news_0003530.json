The one-off fundraising event, called Outside: In, celebrated the British summer. Bringing the great outdoors inside, lawn games including croquet and quoits, the traditional ring toss game, were in hot demand. Guests were looked after by English gentlemen and six bottles of Champagne were won during the course of the evening for players. \nCaterers Food by Dish provided canapés throughout the evening, which included pulled pork in a brioche bun with wilted spinach and Monterey Jack cheese; “posh dog” Cumberland sausage with caramelized onion; chargrilled burger with double Gloucester; creamy mac ‘n’ cheese with baby spinach and cherry tomatoes and falafel with hummus and pitta bread. The venue was suitably dressed for the occasion, complete with outdoor patio furniture, blankets, picket fences, fun props and an interactive photo set. In excess of £1,000 was raised and all profits will be donated to Merlin’s Magic Wand.
