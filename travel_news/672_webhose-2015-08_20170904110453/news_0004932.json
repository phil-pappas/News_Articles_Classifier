Olympic time-trial gold in London a couple of weeks later added to “Wiggomania” and Wiggins ended that year lifting the BBC’s Sports Personality award. Three British wins in four years appear to have lulled the British public into the false impression that winning the Tour is becoming easy. Chris Froome’s victory in Paris on July 26, when he become the first Briton to win the world’s biggest stage race twice, was celebrated, but not with the same gusto as that of Wiggins three years ago. Partly, that was because Froome’s win was not Britain’s first (or Froome’s first); partly because he does not enjoy the same rapport with the British public as Wiggins does. And partly, perhaps, because he had to fight off all sorts of unfounded speculation and innuendo about doping, all of which has been strongly denied. Froome had to withstand a huge amount of scrutiny and intimidation, both verbal and physical, out on the road Froome beat all of the world’s best riders at this year’s Tour. He and Sky performed brilliantly in a vicious first week of crosswinds, cobbles and crashes. They then carried that form into the mountains in weeks two and three, with Froome making that one stunning attack up to La Pierre-Saint-Martin in the Pyrenees on Stage 10. The fact that Froome had to withstand a huge amount of scrutiny, not to mention intimidation, both verbal and physical, out on the road, showed mental toughness. And he showed real grit in limiting his losses as Nairo Quintana came on strong in the last couple of days. The Tour is the ultimate test of a general classification rider and should never be taken for granted. Fara Williams’s performances at the women’s World Cup in Canada and Lewis Hamilton’s victory in the British Grand Prix were terrific, but for becoming the first Briton to win two Tours, Froome is indeed the Liontrust Sporting Hero of the Month for July.
