Danita Delimont/Getty Images BAYFIELD, Wis. — Even for veteran national parks visitor Dan Moore, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore stands out.\n\"There are only four national lakeshores, and the other three are primarily mainland,\" said Moore, 37, a De Pere, Wis., photographer who has visited more than 100 National Parks Service sites. \"There can be thousands of people there, but it's not difficult to get to an area where you're by yourself.\"\nThe park's 21 islands and 12 miles of Lake Superior shoreline offer a study in contrasts.\nIn winter, people often trek for miles to explore the park's Mainland Sea Caves, which are accessible as weather permits. The caves were accessible for nine days this winter; a year earlier, they were accessible for roughly two months and were visited by 138,000 people.\n\"There's so much to see — and then there's even more to see — so we just kept going,\" said Mike Voigt, 40, of Little Chute, Wis. \"We probably walked 6 or 7 miles. The kids loved it because they could crawl into all the nooks and crannies.\"\nBut during the rest of the year, the islands and their lighthouses become the main attraction, and visitors arrive from nearby Bayfield by private craft, water taxi, kayak or excursion boat.\n\"The beauty of nature there is just awesome,\" said Abrams, Wis., resident Bonnie McSwain, 61, who visited last winter with two friends. \"Other places I've been were nothing compared to the Apostles.\"\nWhile most of the park remains open this summer, visitors may find a handful of lighthouses, and some adjacent docks, closed for upgrades:\nThe Michigan Island Lightstation and a nearby dock will close from May 15-Aug. 15. After Aug. 15, the grounds will be open but some exhibits might not be completed.\nThe east and west landings for Devils Island Light — first used in 1857 — may be closed until July 15.\nOuter Island Light, built in 1874 as the most remote of the Apostles' lighthouses, will close from July 1 through Nov. 1. Dock closures may also occur.\nLa Pointe Light on Long Island will close from July 15 through Nov. 1. Dock closures may also occur.\nMoney raised from sea caves visitors is helping to pay for temporary employees and equipment to prepare the site for the coming season.\nSchneider also reports for the Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette.\nAbout the park\nSize : Land: 42,160 acres across 21 islands and 12 miles of the Bayfield Peninsula. Water: 27,232 acres.\nVisitors : 290,059 in 2014\nEstablished : 1970\nHistory : At various times, the islands on Lake Superior have been home to Native Americans, fur-traders, farmers, loggers, fishermen and lighthouse keepers.\nThe islands are believed to have been named by Jesuit missionaries, who drew the first maps of the area in the early 18th century.\nWhen visiting : The headquarters visitor center is one block off Wisconsin Route 13 in Bayfield. The visitor center and fishery exhibit at Little Sand Bay is accessible by road or lake access, 13 miles north of Bayfield. For information call (715) 779-3397. Bring your sea legs. Though the Apostle Islands feature points of interest along the mainland, there is more to experience on the park's 21 islands. The islands are accessible by tour boat, private vessels and kayaks.\nOf note : Apostle Islands National Lakeshore has the most lighthouses — eight, on six islands — of any National Park Service unit.\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlLtM7%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlMXNI.img&description=Apostle+Islands+National+Lakeshore+-+Danita+Delimont%2fGetty+Images"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T21:30:41.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
