Other than some showers on Friday it's expected to be a mild and sunny weekend. This London weather forecast is generated by the Met Office Weather Widget Here are a few events to help you make the most of the coming days. Gladiator Games; Guildhall Yard Ambitiously, the Museum of London this week brings gladiators back to the site of London’s only Roman amphitheatre, found at the Guildhall in the City. It was here that gladiators fought 2,000 years ago, and in a somewhat less brutal re-enactment of those devastating battles, fighters will gather to prove their physical supremacy and secure their future. These Gladiator Games promise to be quite a spectacle but there’s more in store throughout the games. As well as watching the battles rage on, the audience can participate in less rabid pursuits. Roman pottery classes, music lessons and cookery sessions are all on offer, while there’ll also be a chance to tour Roman ruins and explore the streets of Londinium. When: Saturday August 8 to Monday August 10, and Friday August 14 to Sunday August 16 Where: The Guildhall Yard, off Gresham Street, London EC2V 5AE Getting there: by Tube to St Paul's, Bank or Moorgate Cost: £15; children £10; concessions £12.50 London Korean Festival There is, of course, so much more to Korea than kimchi and K-pop, but you can still expect both to feature in this Sunday’s London Korean Festival . Held in Trafalgar Square, the event will provide a showcase for the country’s creative talents, with entertainment on the day including a K-Pop concert, culinary displays, creative workshops, screenings and more.
