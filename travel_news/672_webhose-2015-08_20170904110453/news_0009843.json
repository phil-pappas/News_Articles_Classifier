To this history, the Manila Hotel has been a silent but active and affectionate witness.\nIf the hotel’s walls could speak and narrate the story of this institution, they would indirectly be narrating Philippine history, for the Manila Hotel’s story almost runs parallel to, and remarkably reflects, the broad sweep of Philippine history from the early 20th century on.\nThe Manila Hotel’s inauguration in 1912 introduced to the world an institution that was to become a Jewel in the Orient, a destination that was to be home for the rich and famous. The hotel claimed many firsts: the first Asian hotel to have electric elevators and the first restaurant-ballroom with air conditioning.\nThe Manila Hotel’s new Fiesta Pavilion\nA glimpse of the Fiesta Pavilion\nThe annual ball and reception given by the President of the Philippines for the National Assembly was a fixture in the official calendar during Commonwealth days. The 1939 ball at the Manila Hotel shows the Rigodon de Honor, and vividly portrays the formality and elegance of official entertainment at the time. Formality and protocol were viewed as essential attributes of a nascent state. At the far end of the line is President Manuel Quezon with Mrs. Jose Yulo, wife of the Speaker.

Characteristically, it was built as an establishment catering exclusively to Americans and from which—in typical colonial fashion—natives were barred as patrons, although not as employees. And just to emphasize the point that this was to be an American institution, it was inaugurated with lavish balls and fireworks on July 4, 1912, to coincide with the Independence Day celebrations of the American community here.\nBut just as the Filipinos’ fight for his own independence never stopped, the Filipinos fight for the recognition of his own dignity and sovereignty in his own homeland was likewise reflected in the policies of the Manila Hotel. The initial barriers of social discrimination that existed between whites and browns, which effectively barred native Filipinos from access to the enclaves of the whites, eventually broke down in this hotel.\nFIESTA PAVILION\nPolitical and social changes really came during the time of the Philippine Commonwealth, when the Manila Hotel’s Fiesta Pavilion was the ballroom of choice for huge official functions hosted by the head of state, President Manuel Quezon.\nLavish balls such as Kahirup and Mancomunidad, attended by the richest Filipino families, followed suit. By the mid-1960s, these lavish events caught the ire of student activists who rallied against what they described as callous displays of wealth.\nBy that time, the Fiesta Pavilion had become synonymous with political party conventions that shaped the country’s future.\nHERITAGE CONSERVATION\nIn 1974, the government resisted pressures from designers who considered the original Manila Hotel building to be old, obsolete, and deserved to be completely demolished. The national leadership recoiled at suggestions that a brand-new hotel be constructed on top of the ashes and debris of the old.\nThe government defended the people’s right to demand that their historical landmarks not only be preserved but be restored to them in their former splendor and glory.\n“It would have been a pity if an institution that not even a savage World War could raze to the ground would finally cave in to the methodical and efficient destruction of a demolition crew; that would have been an unforgivable desecration of history,” said President Ferdinand Marcos on the 70th anniversary of the Manila Hotel in 1982.\nNEW FIESTA PAVILION\nLast weekend, the hotel unveiled its latest improvements; the newly refurbished Fiesta Pavilion, restored to its glory and equipped with the latest technological touches.\nAfter more than a year of work, artisans intricately transformed the Manila Hotel’s grand ballroom, the Fiesta Pavilion, into a luxurious realm, adding more flexibility and more functionality in response to the increasing demand for smarter spaces. This is in preparation for the capital city’s hosting of global events.\nVersatility rules the new Fiesta Pavilion; it can host events as varied in size as in atmosphere, whether it’s an intimate wedding for a hundred or cocktails attended by 1,800 guests. The ambience adjusts to clients’ requirements; from the quiet elegance of flowers, candles, crystal and lace, the venue could transform into a futuristic world of pulsating laser lights.\nThere is no doubt the Fiesta Pavilion will continue its century-old role as an elegant witness to history.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-08-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T13:56:03.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
