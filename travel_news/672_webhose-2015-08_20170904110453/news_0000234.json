I knew from my online research that it was chock-full of antebellum structures and had my camera ready. \nTurns out, the town of fewer than 2,800 souls contains 27 pre-Civil War buildings, including the impressive Kirkwood Manor, a plantation home begun in 1857 and still unfinished at the end of the Civil War. \nThe beginnings of Eutaw \nEutaw is the seat of Greene County, located in what is known as the Black Belt region of the state, named for its dark, rich soil. The settlement, founded in 1819, was initially called Mesopotamia, a name still found on the town's historic cemetery. In 1838, citizens decided to move the county seat from Erie to Mesopotamia and felt the town needed a new name. \nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Alabama , Eutaw is named for a Revolutionary War event. \"The city is named for the Battle of Eutaw Springs, a decisive battle in the American Revolution in which troops led by war hero Nathaniel Greene (for whom the county is named) recaptured Charleston, S.C., from the British.\" Because of its location near the Warrior River, Eutaw was a shipping and cotton hub in the first half of the 19 th century. Like many once-bustling towns, Eutaw suffered economically during Reconstruction. \nToday, despite some empty storefronts in its quaint downtown and some historic homes in need of restoration, Eutaw is a draw for tourists interested in its antebellum history. \nThe Eutaw Formation \nEutaw has an interesting history below-ground, as well. A geologic feature that runs beneath parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi is known as the Eutaw Formation because the greatest portion of the formation lies near the surface in Eutaw. Dozens of Upper Cretaceous fossils – including dinosaurs, mosasaurs and pterosaur – have been unearthed in the formation. \nKirkwood Manor \nKirkwood is a Greek Revival-style mansion with Italianate influences, including a large cupola. According to RuralSWAlabama.org , the house features two floors topped by the cupola and a portico with Ionic columns on two sides of the home. \nThe most intriguing aspect of the beautiful home is that it was begun in 1857 and basically remained unfinished for more than 100 years, until the 1970s. Foster M. Kirksey, a cotton planter and broker, was nearing completion of the home when the Civil War began. Because Kirksey lost much of his fortune in the war, he was unable to add the luxurious finishing touches he had planned, or even to maintain it properly. \nRuralSWAlabama explains: \"The house remained in the Kirksey family until 1961. In 1972, Roy and Mary Swayze bought the home and began renovations with Mr. Swayze doing much of the work himself. When the Swayzes painted the home in 1977, it was its first coat of paint since 1912 and took 200 gallons of paint.\" \nThe Swayzes spent 15 years restoring Kirkwood and were awarded a National Trust for Historic Preservation Honor Award in 1982. \n\"Scenes from ...\" is a photo feature of small towns throughout Alabama.
