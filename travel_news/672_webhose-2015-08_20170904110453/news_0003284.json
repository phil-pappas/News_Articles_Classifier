Long Beach, CA, August 08, 2015 --( PR.com )-- Siren School, creators of full-immersion theme experiences, has just added adult day camps to its event line-up as a means of helping participants to fight day-to-day stresses with healthy, good-natured play.\"Play brings joy. And it’s vital for problem solving, creativity and relationships,\" says Margarita Tartakovsky, M.S., Associate Editor at PsychCentral.com. \"Play is just as pivotal for adults as it is for kids ... Play can even facilitate deep connections between strangers and cultivate healing.\"“Play sparks the imagination, fosters teamwork, and gets participants out of their heads. Though fantasy and history are often involved, activities are a far cry from the escapism associated with interests and pastimes that lead to addiction. We're not trying to escape reality. Rather, we're immersing ourselves in the reality of beauty, creativity, freedom and fellowship,\" says Siren School Headmistress J.S. Devivre. \"Cultural customs, age-old crafts, fantasy personas, dance, international foods, outdoor activities—they all come together to expand participants' scope of thought and to interest them in new, decidedly exciting pursuits. Our adult day camps, along with all our events, are designed to put a spring in your step and a smile on your face, to improve your mood and make you more pleasant to be around.\"In the spirit of nurturing and needful play, Siren School has developed a variety of playful experiences, ranging in duration from an hour to several days. What differentiates Siren School Day Camps from the company’s Mythic Adventures Destination Getaways is that participants go home each night as opposed to paying for onsite meals and accommodations.“These events are created for grownups who have curfews,” adds Devivre.Current half-day to 2-day camp offerings include:• Run Away with the Circus — a day spent learning circus arts such as Trapeze and Tissu skills followed by a performance of Cirque du Soleil• Mermaid Bootless Camp — adults dive into mermaid lore and activities, as well as the bay, outfitted in swimmable mermaid tails• A Grimm Scavenger Hunt — conducted in Huntington Beach’s storybook Old World VillageIntensives for those seeking something of longer duration include:• Fantasy Fitness Elementals — a 4-day outdoor dance program focusing on earth, air, fire and water• EtiCamp — 3 days of Hostess and HospitaliTea training• Certifications — 1-3 day courses for those who desire to offer Siren School events in their region of the countryAll Siren School programs are meant to get students tapping into their imaginations, to help them crawl or sprint out of their comfort zones, to engage their sense of whimsy and re-ignite their belief in the wonders of the human spirit, all through play.“Play energizes us and enlivens us. It eases our burdens. It renews our natural sense of optimism and opens us up to new possibilities.” -Stuart Brown, MD.Visit SirenSchool.com for information on the myriad theme-based programs the company offers for both adults and families or send an email to SirenSchool@gmail.com.Siren School – where education is an adventure in self-discovery Contact Information", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:13:24.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
