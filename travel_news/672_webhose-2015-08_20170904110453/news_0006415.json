The Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau hosted an event this morning called, \"State of the Industry: A Destination Marketing Forum\" at The Brown Hotel's Crystal Ballroom. The event featured a panel discussion, which centered on creating an experience that will attract people to the city. Here are a few takeaways: Because of its comparatively small size, Louisville is poised to be competitive among cities across the country that seek to attract business conventions. \"People don't want to get lost in a big city,\" said John Graham , president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based American Society of Association Executives. \"They want to go to a city where the signage on the streets (says): 'XYZ association's in town.' … I really think the future is very bright for cities like Louisville.\" Simplification and flexibility are key to attracting millennials. \"They want to be able to network, to connect, and to have it be easy and quick,\" said Deborah Long Sexton , president and CEO of the Chicago-based Professional Convention Management Association. Conventions also need to be interactive and engaging, and that's true for every demographic. \"You've got 10 minutes,\" Sexton said, \"and you'd better have a good joke, or you'd better have another direction, or something, because you're not going to keep people engaged for that typical 45-, 60-, 75-minute presentation. It just doesn't exist any more for any of us — forget the generations.\" Perhaps contrary to what you might expect, face-to-face interaction is more sought-after now than ever. \"Millenials want to meet face-to-face more than any other generation,\" said Paul Van Deventer , president and CEO of Dallas-based Meeting Professionals International, a global event industry organization. \"And as each of the new millennial generations comes on board, they want it even more than the prior one. So you're seeing this acceleration of face-to-face desire.\" Conventions need to be exciting so that business guests will return. \"Every convention planner is potentially a leisure traveler, a guest for us in the future,\" said Karen Williams , president and CEO of the Louisville Convention & Visitors Bureau . The choice to renovate the Kentucky International Convention Center was a good one. \"The fact that you're reinvesting, that means that you have secured more business and that you want the facilities to be the best they possibly can be,\" Sexton said. \"So I think it was a very good decision.\" Additional factors that help Louisville attract business conventions are the comparatively low cost of its facilities and the uniqueness of its amenities, such as its bourbon tourism destinations. Saving money is critical to event planners, said Van Deventer. Conference-goers are demanding a more sophisticated experience, he said, but planners' budgets aren't going up. \"The planner is in a position of, 'Give us a better experience with more creativity on a shorter time window, because things are moving faster, and do it with less cost per person than you have in the past. \" … You come in saying, 'Well, you know what, if you come and look at us and the way we bring things together, we can give you a really cost-competitive package with a better and more unique experience.\" Millennials in particular want to experience not just a convention but a city's amenities, such as restaurants, attractions and downtown life, said Graham. \"It's not just getting on a plane, going to a hotel, going to the convention center and going home again,\" he said. \"It's really about, 'How do I experience the city?' And the more experiences we can provide, the more attractive your destination becomes.\" \nWant Louisville Travel news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
