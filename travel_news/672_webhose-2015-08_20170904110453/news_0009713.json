That being said, I’m also health-conscious. The great thing about living a simpler lifestyle is that I can eliminate certain purchases from my budget that help me both save money and live a little healthier at the same time.\nEliminating a few things can be so simple, but it will take some willpower if you’re used to purchasing these items on a regular basis.\nHere are 6 items you can eliminate from your spending this week to save money.\n1. Soda. It’s a no-brainer right? Eliminating just this one item can make you a little healthier and keep more money in your pocket. Avoid the soda aisle at the grocery store and if you do eat out, choose to order water instead of soda.\n2. Boxed or Bagged Snacks. Things like potato chips, trail mix and such can be eliminated from the budget entirely and replaced with fruit or vegetables. Surprisingly enough, these things can increase your spending a lot more than buying local produce from a farmer’s market.\n3. The Daily Grind. If you’re a coffee drinker, it can be hard to think of completely eliminating this from your regular purchases. So if you’re not up for completely putting an end to your daily dose of caffeine, consider making your own at home vs. picking up a cup of java from the local shop.\n4. Paper Towels and Napkins. Making the switch to using cloth at home instead of disposable paper towels and napkins can save you money and help the environment at the same time.\n5. Most Household Cleaners. Pretty much anything around the house can be cleaned up with plain old vinegar and/or baking soda. Do this: mix 1 part white vinegar with 3 parts water and you have a general household cleaner. If you’d like, you can add a few drops of your favorite essential oil for fragrance purposes. Baking soda can be used for the tougher jobs that need some scrubbing power (ie. that soap scum in the bathroom - blech!).\n6. Brand New Clothing. They don’t call me thrifty for nothing. I love poppin’ me some tags at the thrift shop. Thrift store/yard sale/consignment sale clothing is the way to go if you want to save some serious cash.\nJust eliminating a couple of these purchases can easily cut down on your monthly spending, and you’ll be simplifying at the same time!
