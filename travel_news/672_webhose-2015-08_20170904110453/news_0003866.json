Certain physical requirements are required, so if you are unsure call ahead.\nThese three destinations are located near each other, so you could visit all over a few days or simply stay put at one and explore. Both resorts offer activities open to the public. All are family oriented and have plenty to see and do to keep everyone occupied.\nZiplining and more at Seven Springs Mountain Resort\nLike many ski resorts, Seven Springs capitalizes on summer by offering a variety of experiences, including two zip-line adventures – the Screaming Hawk and Canopy Tour.\nLasting about 90 minutes, the Screaming Hawk ($49 per person) includes four zips with a swaying bridge thrown in “for fun.” Unlike the woodsy Canopy Tour, this one is out in the open.\nLocked into harnesses and helmets by our trusty guides Adrian and Jake, our group of six headed out to the course. Our first challenge was simply getting to the first platform by scaling the “Spider Web” cargo net.\nBefore we started, Jake provided solid advice: “Take your time; enjoy the ride.” A first jump off can be tough for newbies, as was the case for the “Mom” on our tour, but she soldiered on. Once one gets past initial stomach flips, the views are really stunning and the zips exhilarating.\nScreaming Hawk’s first two zips are each 350 feet. From Copperhead Tower we zipped to perch No. 2, aptly called the Flying Squirrel. Of the entire experience, this swaying perch (by design) was the most unnerving. We couldn’t zip off it fast enough, which was lucky because it turned out to be a fast zip to the Rattler’s Roost.\nFrom Rattler’s we zipped 425 feet to Red Fox, where we crossed a swaying bridge (gulp) to Venom Tower and the final, 777-foot zip to Jack Rabbit Jump. This “fun” final challenge has us walk the plank, then jump to the ground.\nWhile the experience sounds fast moving, it’s not. Between hooking and unhooking, and waiting for perches to clear, the nice pace allows for conversation and bonding.\nAn arborist was inspecting the Canopy Tour ($97 weekends/$81 weekdays) the day of our visit, so it was closed on our visit. We learned the 3½-hour tour guides guests from tree platform to platform via zip lines and bridges along the Laurel Ridgeline. It ends on the final 1,500-foot Timberline Terror zip. Details can be found on the resort’s website.\nIf zipping isn’t for you, Seven Springs offers other fantastic experiences that have their roots in winter sports.\nAt the top of our list was the Alpine Slide, a summer version of a winter favorite. Reached via a chairlift, guests ride a cart 1,980 feet down on a cement track. Using a hand brake, we controlled our speed.\nSummer tubing was also fantastic. Deceivingly fast, guests rumble along on a rubber mat solo or hooked in groups.\nFor bouncy kids and adults there’s a EuroBungy trampoline hybrid and a rock-climbing wall. For a calmer day, hydrobikes and paddleboats provide leisurely tours of Lake Tahoe. Or simply lounge at the resort pool.\nSeven Springs also offers sporting experiences like horseback riding, clay shooting, golfing and fishing. An extensive mountain bike trail system is on site too, with rentals.\nSummer family packages start at $258 per adult double occupancy, breakfast included. An All-Day Activity Bracelet for day guests is $47; $36 for houseguests.\nSeven Springs resort is located in Seven Springs, Pa. Visit 7springs.com.\nLaurel Highlands River Tours & Outdoor Center\nA smaller yet just as enjoyable experience is the Zipline Adventure Park operated by Laurel Highlands River Tours & Outdoor Center in Ohiopyle State Park in Pennsylvania.\nThe course offers two levels, by design, said activities director Brett Lesnick, who noted youngsters are sometimes too short for traditional courses. The Explorer Level ($20/$24 weekends) is for ages 4 and up (at least 40 pounds), while the Adventure Level ($34/$44 weekends) is for those 10 and up. Unlike a zip line-only course, this one presents obstacles before a final zip.\nOnce again, we climbed a cargo net to guide Violet, who hooked us on a trolley cable.\nChallenges included swinging rope-bridges, a nerve-racking log bridge with dangling rope grips, more netting and a sliding surfboard. The final 90-foot zip returned us to the main platform.\nBelow us youngsters happily traversed their course over and over again. We were done after two trips. Young lad A.J. (who followed us), was undoubtedly relieved to be rid of us slow pokes.\nThe center can organize all types of adventures. We rode cruiser bikes ($5 an hour/$25 day) along the absolutely gorgeous wooded Great Allegheny Passage trail that runs from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C. The crushed limestone surface was outstanding, with two bridge crossings over the beautiful Youghiogheny River.\nThe center can provide everything from do-it-yourself rentals to guided mountain bike, rafting, kayak and rock-climbing tours. They can even set up lodging.\nPlenty of food choices are in the immediate area. The darling Ohiopyle House Café (ohiopylehousecafe.com) and Firefly Grill (thefireflygrill.com) don’t mind guests who have spent the day adventuring.\nThe new, nearby Visitors Center has interactive exhibits for the kids.

Guides assist at the 1,500-foot mid-point. The second half brings guests to the bottom of the mountain. A state-of-the-art self-breaking system allows guests to zip at their own comfort level. Cost is $45 per person or $100 per person for a two-hour pass.\nThe Canopy Tour takes guests along a challenging course 40 feet above ground that includes elements like a Burma bridge, swinging and stationary logs and more. It includes a ride down the FatBird SuperFlyer. Cost is $115 per person. For the youngsters there is a Little Tykes Ropes Course that is 20 feet high and geared for ages 4-8. It includes three obstacles and costs $25 per child for three trips around.\nLike Seven Springs, Nemacolin offers activities for day or resort guests at its Adventure Center and Wildlife Academy.
