Originating from the four Atlantic Canadian Provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, where commercial fishery and aquaculture sectors are committed to innovative harvesting and farming practices and sustainability, naturally delicious, highest quality seafood is praised for maintaining the delicate balance of the visual appeal, mouth-watering aroma, full-bodied flavor and satisfying texture. While over half the world’s supply of lobster – Hong Kong’s most beloved seafood - comes from the clear, cold waters of Atlantic Canada, this Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified natural resource is carefully protected. Sourced from a strictly limited number of independent fishers who tend their own traps and adhere to sustainable harvesting practices, each lobster is individually inspected, with the undersized and females with eggs released to protect the future of the fishery. After harvesting, lobsters are carefully maintained in optimal conditions mimicking the natural environment as they are conditioned for travel which minimizes stress, resulting in a best quality product at its prime. The Atlantic Canada Seafood Menu is available at dinner time only as a la carte selection from 8 September till 20 September, 6:30pm – 10:30pm. Promotion is supported by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
