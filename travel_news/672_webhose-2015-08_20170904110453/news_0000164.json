The hotel is a historic building and when the owners came to seek contractors to resurface the drive it was an important decision to get the right finish to ensure it would be in keeping with the hotel and its grounds. \nThe Old Lodge was originally built in 1604 as the Gatehouse to the Castle of Malton. It is a listed building that narrowly escaped demolition due to a family feud! Its grounds are a National Monument, due to the ancient treasures that may lie beneath. “The new drive has become a talking point and guests both from the local community coming for dining, social occasions and weddings plus resident guests are all commenting on how impressive the new drive looks so I’m calling it ‘my drive for business!’ ” comments Eileen Lowery, hotel manager. The new drive was installed by contractors S&B Smallman of Pontefract who specialize in tar macadam laying and surfacing including driveways and pathways, school playgrounds, car parks and private roads. The resin-based solution used at the Old Lodge has ensured a smart looking finish and is also very easy for access by people in wheelchairs. “The solution is importantly sympathetic to the historic building and provides the management and staff with an easy to maintain surface that also looks good”. added Eileen.
