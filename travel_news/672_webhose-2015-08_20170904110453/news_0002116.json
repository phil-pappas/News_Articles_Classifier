I then received a cold call from Aerial telling me it had been authorised to offer me the incentive to lock into O2 for a two-year contract with my monthly payment to be reduced by £2. It knew so much about me I assumed the offer was endorsed by O2. However, the promised written confirmation did not come and my O2 account online still showed the old price. • 'Vodafone billed me for phone I do not own' • 'TalkTalk wouldn’t fix internet and charged us £360' When I spoke to Aerial it said my contract was with it, which I never agreed to. Now it wants my bank account details as the only way to get the £2 monthly reduction. I have no information about its address, no email, not a scrap of paper from Aerial. It says it has posted me things I have never received. I reckon I have lost more than £175 dealing with this. John Hughes , Essex Finding out that the £2 saving was to come in the form of a monthly refund from Aerial was irksome. For such a small gain this was a complicated arrangement and not what you had understood it to be. I said as much to O2, whose spokesman replied: “Aerial is an O2 trusted partner and our terms and conditions state that we share customers’ details with them.” I spoke to Aerial, which now agreed to reverse the contract. Your account will now be managed directly by O2. O2 is implementing the same terms of the agreement you had been offered. This includes a £2 monthly discount applied to your O2 account and backdated. This means that for 24 months you will pay £7.19 per month. The cost of two months’ line rental is being credited for goodwill. You say this issue had been on your mind when you had many other things to think about and you are glad it is finished with. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T13:48:40.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
