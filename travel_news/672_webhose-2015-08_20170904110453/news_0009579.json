The Portuguese, Dutch, Danes, French and British fought many battles to lay claim to this land, but ultimately it was the French who in 1673 made it their “home” for the next few centuries.\nFilled with sun, sea and sand, the Mediterranean aura reminded the colonisers of the Riviera. They turned this fishing hub into a settlement reminiscent of towns such as Nice, Cannes and Toulon and quickly became a hub of French politics, commerce and culture. After relinquishing power to independent India in 1954, the colonizers left behind their architecture, culture and traditions, including Bastille Day, which is still celebrated every year on 14 July with much pageantry.\nThe French built the town into two parts: Ville Noire, or black town for native Indians, and Ville Blanche, or white town, designed exclusively for the Europeans. That division somehow still exists in Pondicherry, renamed Puducherry in 2006\nVille Noire is marked by crowds, chaos and cacophony while Ville Blanche is relatively quieter and cleaner. There is a seaside promenade, a lighthouse, tree-lined avenues, shady lanes, colourful churches, statues and monuments and several white- and mustard-coloured villas with bright pink bougainvillea.\nVisitors generally spend time in Ville Blanche to get a taste of the bygone era; many of the inhabitants are still French nationals. There is no shortage of French connections including signage in French, policemen wearing red kepi, and locals playing petanque, a popular French bowling game. The streets are almost litter free, unusual for urban India. French is widely spoken. Baguettes are eaten for breakfast, rather than South Indian dosa and idli.\nMany Ville Blanche locals fear that French Pondicherry is losing it unique charm to development. As modern houses replace the old villas, kurta-pajama residents replace European suits locals, Indian spices infiltrate French kitchens and Christmas carols sung in local Tamil are becoming more common.\nGetting There & Staying\nFly Air Canada ( www.aircanada.com ) via Frankfurt to Chennai which is the nearest international airport (about 160 km away). There is no shortage of hotels to suit budget, as well as many former 18th-century French villas converted into boutique hotels. Hotel de L’Orient and Hotel Le Dupleix, once home to the French Mayor, are two popular venues.\nFrench Exhibits\nThere are statues of French Governor Dupleix and Joan of Arc. French influence can also be seen in edifices such as Hotel de Ville (Town Hall), Raj Nivas, the former French Governor’s residence, the grand French Consulate and Alliance Francaise Office and Aayi Mandapam, a white cenotaph built by Napoleon III to honor a local courtesan. The French War Memorial, is brightly illuminated at night. The French-built churches, especially the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Norte Dame des Anges, are worth looking at.\nSpiritual Attraction\nThe Sri Aurobindo Ashram is an internationally renowned yoga retreat and major attraction for visitors. It was established in 1926 by Aurobindo Ghose, a Cambridge-educated Indian freedom fighter turned yogi, and his follower Paris-born Mirra Alfassa, famously known as The Mother. She arrived Pondicherry in 1920 and never went back. Mother established Auroville, a township dedicated to human unity, located about 6 km from the Ashram.\n“Life of Pi”\nCanadian writer Yann Martel wrote about Pondicherry in “Life of Pi” after meeting Francis Adirubasamy at a café in Pondicherry in 1996. He was inspired to write about a Pondicherry zookeeper, his son and their voyage to Canada. Hollywood movie director Ang Lee created the film version (and temporarily transformed the current Botanical Garden into a zoo for the film.)\nSandip Hor is an Australia-based freelance travel writer and photographer.\nMore on thestar.com\nSiri refuses to spill info about Apple's iPhone event\nCohabitation agreement will help clear living arrangements: Ellie", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:49:05.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
