United has updated its mobile app to include: New, interactive indoor maps for its Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Angeles , New York / Newark , San Francisco and Washington hubs, with more airports to be added soon \"Indoor location\" functionality, currently in beta testing for customers traveling through Newark Liberty International Airport, using beacons to help customers navigate the airline's Terminal C complex New self-booking functions that offer more options for faster re-booking in the event of a flight delay or cancellation The updates are available for iOS devices and are coming soon for Android devices. New, Easy-to-Use Hub Maps The new, interactive maps enable customers to search quickly for nearby airport vendors and services such as restaurants, ATM locations or family restrooms, and enable travelers to easily navigate to gates throughout the terminal. Several airport maps also include navigation to rental car facilities and on-site airport hotels. If customers have a boarding pass stored in the app, the map will automatically default to start navigation at that specific gate location. Alternatively, the user can place a pin at his or her current location to indicate where he or she is in the airport. The app will guide customers to their desired destinations within the terminal, estimating walk times to make flight connections that much easier.

Through the use of Bluetooth low-energy beacons, the Newark Liberty airport map will use \"indoor location\" technology to pinpoint a user's location within the airport to navigate toward various locations - eliminating the need for the user to pin his or her location. United intends to expand the feature to other airports based on customer feedback. Self-service Tools for Quicker Re-booking United is also expanding the self-service functions available to customers in the event of a flight delay, cancellation or missed connection. Through a few clicks in the app, customers may choose from a variety of flight options including alternate airports or, if a confirmed seat isn't available on their preferred flights, add themselves to a standby list for an earlier flight. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:59:06.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
