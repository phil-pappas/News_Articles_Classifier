Last week I got to ride in that beautiful area again. \nUnlike the previous visit, this time I went with a tour company. Trailhead, a newcomer in the northern province's growing bike tour business, has set itself apart from existing operators by offering a premium service, which of course comes at a higher price. \nInstead of using a pickup or van for shuttling bikers to the trails, Trailhead uses an SUV. That means the group is small, no more than six riders with two guides already included. \nThe SUV, with its 4X4 capability, was a good idea because during the rainy season, like now, the mountain road linking Ban Mae Na on Highway 107 to Pa Kia can be really nasty. In many sections, the surface is now covered with thick layers of sticky and slippery red mud. With the bike rack mounted directly on the vehicle, instead of on a trailer, the shuttle can take riders and the bikes (the tour provided us with new Kona Precept DL, full-suspension trail bikes with 27.5-inch wheels) to where the trail begins regardless of the road's condition. \nOn the first day of our trip, the SUV transported us, three riders, up the mountain to Yaek Pa Kia. This is a three-way junction on the same ridge that Pa Kia Highland Research and Training Centre of Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Agriculture, the destination of my ride back in April, is located. \nThis time, however, I wouldn't be going south to the centre. The guide was to take me and my friend Ruj westward in the direction of Ban San Pa Kia, a hilltribe village. \nGliding down a fire road lined with pines and other lush trees was a pleasant way to begin a day of riding. Soon we reached a lower ridge where the hillsides were open, allowing us to see the San Pa Kia village on a foothill, and beyond that a valley and another ridge that also extends westward. \nWe didn't veer off the \"main road\" to visit the village though. Further along the way, we would be passing through a few more anyway. Another reason, which was even more important, was that we needed to save our energy for the arduous climbs to regain the elevation we had lost during the initial descent. The uphill riding (and pushing) seemed endless, every long, steep climb was continuously followed by yet another. The Kona Precept was not bad at climbing, and I hoped I had the leg power to match its performance. \nWe stopped to have a lunch and seek shelter from the rain at a village in the middle of nowhere. The hilltribe people there were so friendly. Some even invited us to take our break at the space beneath their wooden stilt houses, which we did. The long ride was tough for me but the refreshing mountain air and the scenery, from natural forest to corn plantations and terraced rice paddies, made the hard work a really small price to pay. \nLek, the guide, not only knew his way around in these mountains, he also had good knowledge about the local people's way of life as well as about the plants that we found along the way. He even showed us how blowing the leaf stalks of sabu dam ( Jatropha curcas ) can make bubbles! \nOur first day's ride ended late in the afternoon at Ban Sop Kai in a valley carved by the Mae Taeng river. The shuttle vehicle with chilled beverages, including fresh coconuts, was already waiting for us at the river's bridge. \nApart from the shuttle, the bike, a backpack and protective gear, accommodation and food are also included in Trailhead's multi-day tour programme. That night we stayed at Chiang Dao Nest 1, a down-to-earth resort highly acclaimed for its Western restaurant. Great food and good sleep was all we needed to get ready for another day of riding. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
