If you fancy a challenge but pounding city streets just doesn’t appeal, the Rat Race Coast to Coast could be for you. The Scotland Coast to Coast challenge, which is taking place in September, is a two-day endurance race that requires walking, running, cycling and kayaking to get you from the North Sea coast to the Atlantic seaboard over 105 miles of rocky terrain, via Inverness, Loch Ness, Glencoe, Fort Augustus, Fort William and Ben Nevis. The scenery is stunning, but you’ll need to be reasonably fit to take on the test over two days in the “Challenger” category. That way, there’s camping halfway (with food and a real ale bar – we’re not talking the Olympic athletes’ village here). If you’re already in peak condition, you may want to take on the “Expert” category, where participants can do the whole thing in a day. There are over 1,000 participants, so you’ll be in good company whichever you choose. The route begins at Nairn beach, north east of Inverness, and heads south west, towards Cawdor Castle for the cycling stage. Bikers aim for Loch Ness, then it’s a kayak crossing and a run, to bag the first 57 miles. There’s no concrete or buildings to get in the way, just stunning scenery and fresh air all the way Camp on the shores of the lake, watch the sunset with a beer, and be up early to take on the second day of the challenge. Day two is an uphill cycle, through the Great Glen towards Fort William, then it’s long-distance hiking or running to Loch Leven. In the final stages there are glorious views over the Western coast, where your journey finishes at The Isles of Glencoe Hotel. The last leg is past the isles of Glencoe by kayak – and then a quick sprint brings you to the hotel, where a party is held to celebrate. Training several times a week is necessary, of course. The route is exhilarating but occasionally gruelling – and if you’re serious about competing to win, at “Expert” level, you’ll need to be very fit. Challengers, however, can do the course in pairs (though you must stick together throughout), and while reasonable fitness is obviously a must, it’s open to all ages. For a completely different take on a triathlon, the Coast to Coast is the answer. There’s no concrete or buildings to get in the way, just stunning scenery and fresh air all the way. This year’s race takes place on 12-13 September.
