Sam’s bachelorettes couldn’t believe their eyes when their new competition entered the mansion during tonight’s drama-filled episode.\nBusy toasting themselves for making the final six, a couple of mystery babes — one brunette and one blonde — rocked up to the cocktail party uninvited.\nOther Stories ‘Something was terribly wrong’ News 0 comments Farah reveals reserve grade bombshell Nrl 0 comments ‘If it’s not OK, go f … ing eat somewhere else’ Nsw 0 comments Hopoate in limbo, Test star re-signs Nrl 0 comments The poorest man in the richest suburb City East 0 comments Did Kerr’s near-nude stunt go too far? Celebrity 0 comments But Lana Jeavons-Fellows, the first of the date crashers thrown into the lion’s den, says the whole encounter was far more awkward for her.\n“Once the reality kind of sunk in that I was going to walk in there with X amount of beautiful girls all trying to date the same guy it was a little bit daunting,” the 27-year-told told news.com.au\n“It was awkward, it was so awkward.”\n“Not bothered” ... Emily wasn’t feeling threatened at all. But, despite trying not to make too much of a splash — even tiptoeing down the garden stairs to meet the ladies — the NSW-born beauty couldn’t prevent the interrogation from some of her new housemates.

But this year’s top six weren’t the only ones left feeling ambushed, Osher only informed Sam of the two fresh faces moments before their arrival.\nAnd Jeavons-Fellows, who says she “knew absolutely nothing about anyone” and had “no game plan” coming into the mansion, played her ‘first impression’ cards pretty damn well.\nThe blindsided Bach couldn’t seem to get enough of those beautiful big eyes and told the brunette that she was “a good twist”.\n“I think if you have a connection with someone it doesn’t matter whether you met them five weeks ago or five minutes ago, the spark is either there or it’s not,” Jeavons-Fellows said.\nAmbushed by a mystery blonde in a sequin dress. The rest of the episode was filled with the kind of chaos we’ve been hanging out for all season: Sarah lands herself a rose.\nBec chin bows out quietly.\nEmily blows up, calls Nina “rough” behind her back and then barrels out the front door.\nOh, and blonde intruder Rachel Moore has already been dubbed ‘the crazy cat lady’.\nBring on Thursday night’s episode.\nThe Bachelor, airs Wednesday and Thursday, 7.30pm on Ten.\nWell, this conversation went well ...", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3c3695ed2d9868b8012ede6d01251049", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aade5f008aa15443c12ae5faf841b3b4?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b102b3fa8a730df5b02c507c91141d58?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/42b1f0141fdf7bfe6e1c76d147cdb20b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/686d3794029f13885d3a0d2df28306d7", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2765a2e0e64039d170af8446c17b4137", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/058bcc1c9dfe5414aa1f9c9d78504255?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cc8929fa0eb1adbc75480b44d500cdda?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fc7029816dc95af13408fe583a3a358b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f8da46dd730fc74be8366ab93d4e2f7e"], "published": "2015-08-26T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:04:18.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
