Couple that with the many great early booking incentives on winter vacation packages available in the market right now, and you've got all the reasons you need to book today.\n\"We are already seeing tour operators react to the falling loonie by adding currency surcharges,\" said Dean Moore , CEO of itravel2000. \"Fuel and hotel contracts are all negotiated in U.S. dollars but their earnings are in Canadian dollars, so while they do hedge to a certain extent in order to protect themselves against any wild swings in the value of the dollar, depending on the extent of those swings they often have to turn to surcharges, as we are seeing now.\"\nCiting the ability to lock in a price on a winter vacation, while also taking advantage of the great rates and many offers designed to incentivize early bookings, including lower deposit requirements, price drop protection plans and added value inclusions such as free seat selection and free room upgrades, Moore \"strongly recommends anyone planning on getting away this coming winter to book early.\"\n\"Trading has been very strong for us over the past few months, and the traditional peak travel periods – Christmas, New Year's , Reading Week & March Break – are already in high demand, with some dates and resorts already sold out or very close to it. It is key to book early to not only get the best deal but to also get exactly the vacation you want,\" concluded Moore.\nFor more information or to book, please call 1.866.WOW.DEAL or go online to itravel2000.com .\nAbout itravel2000 – Founded in 1994 and headquartered in Mississauga, ON , itravel2000 is one of Canada's largest independent travel companies and the nation's trusted source in travel.
