Towards that end have several hundred Turkish construction workers already arrived and the site is once again a beehive of activity. \nThe Chinese construction firm caused a massive delay now coming to over three years, costing Rwanda dearly in lost MICE revenues which was to become another cornerstone for the tourism industry besides wildlife based and cultural visits. \nThe hotel, when complete, will be managed under the Radisson Blu brand, adding much needed bed capacity to the market while Rwanda is already actively marketing the new convention centre as a magnet for meetings, conferences and conventions. \nThe government of Rwanda is presently financing the project directly though it is expected that private equity partners will sooner or later come on board and pay back government for the upfront expenses incurred for the construction. Apart from the hotel and conference centre is a technology park part of the development with emphasis on ITC developments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T04:39:37.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
