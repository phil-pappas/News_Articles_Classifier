Art Director Stephan Jost said the loss of those pieces prompted the museum to verify certain items had clear titles, which led to the discovery that Greene's artifacts lacked documentation.\nThe sculptures are valued at $1.275 million.\nThe initial agreement said the museum would pay him for life, but payments were stopped in June.\nGreene could not be reached for comment.\n___\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1L4iGZf)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T08:36:49.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
