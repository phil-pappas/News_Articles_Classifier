Sky News 06 Aug 2015 News Grief ... Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak breaks down before announcing confirmation of the debris. Source: AFP \nMORE plane debris has been collected, including a window and some aluminium foil, Malaysia’s Transport Minister has announced. \nBut Liow Tiong Lai says he cannot confirm they belong to Flight MH370, which went missing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board. \n“I can only ascertain that it’s plane debris.” \nMr Liow told reporters tonight that “there [were] many items collected” from the Indian Ocean island where a wing flap was found last week, which Malaysian experts earlier confirmed was part of the missing plane. \nMr Liow said the new debris has been sent “to the French authorities for verification. I cannot confirm that it’s from MH370”. \nMr Liow said Malaysia has asked authorities in neighbouring area, including Mauritius and Madagascar, to help comb their beaches for possible debris to widen the search.

More analysis was required. Debris ... Police carry the wing flaperon from the beach on the island of Reunion.

It’s been such a long journey of emotions this past 17 months,” said Ms Lawton. \nIrene Burrows, whose son Rodney and daughter-in-law Mary were travelling with the Lawtons said the Malaysian announcement provided no real answers. \n“It’s just made us relive everything, it doesn’t bring anything home. There’s still a lot of mystery,” said Mrs Burrows. They found it ... The wing flaperon, which washed up on Reunion, was confirmed to be a piece of debris. Picture: Supplied Source: AFP Mr Truss said it was Malaysia’s right as the flag carrier for the aircraft to make such a declaration, a week after the flaperon washed up on Reunion Island.\n“There are some i’s not dotted and t’s not crossed — there is still a very small element of doubt,” said Mr Truss. \n“The French are being more cautious but from the Malaysians ... they are now satisfied that the body of evidence is sufficient to say this is wreckage from MH370.” MH370 search area ocean drift modelling 1:00 \nOcean drift modelling from the CSIRO shows the flaperon discovered on a La Runion beach could have originated from the MH370 search area. Courtesy CSIRO News Corp Australia 06 Aug 2015 News \nUniversity of Sydney international relations expert Dr Justin Hastings said it was in Malaysia’s interests to have the matter “cleaned up”. \n“My guess is from a Malaysian perspective, they had two planes go down (last year). For the credibility of the country, it’s about the worst thing that could happen,” said Dr Hastings. \n“They want this cleaned up, dealt with and put away. \n“After making a series of misinformed and premature announcements when the plane first disappeared, it would appear they’ve learnt nothing.” Experts on board ... Malaysia's civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman and other experts leave the aviation centre in Toulous. Picture: Supplied Source: AFP \nInvestigators in France are working from the “outside-in” on the flaperon, testing paint samples, and biological matter such as barnacles and shells. \nGriffith University PhD student, Ryan Pearson said the chemistry of barnacle shells could reveal much about the flaperon’s journey. \n“The shell chemistry can tell us things like water temperature, salinity and other components when the shell was laid down,” said Mr Pearson. \n“It could help in tracking the movement of the flaperon back through different parts of the ocean.” The instigators ... Local council worker Johny Begue, with his wife Marie, found the wing flaperon. Picture: Cameron Richardson Source: News Corp Australia Forensics engineering expert, Dr Doug Perovic from the University of Toronto, said it appeared the flaperon had detached from the aircraft before it hit the water.\n“What I see is a flaperon that disassociated from the wing at some point, prior to the wing impacting the ocean surface,” said Dr Perovic. \n“I think the most likely explanation is the plane went into a fast speed during its final moments and the flaperon suffered this high speed fluttering and became detached.” \nThe further testing being done in France — by an international team that includes an Australian — will including analysing a suitcase found near the flaperon. \nOn Reunion Island, officials played down the likelihood of more possible MH370 debris being located. \nA local government spokesman said the island was such a small part of the Indian Ocean, there was a general belief the flaperon would be the only debris from MH370 to wash up here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:07:51.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
