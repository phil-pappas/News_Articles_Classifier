Then you’d better get voting in the 2015 holiday ‘Oscars’.\nPublic participation in the prestigious British Travel Awards is now open until September 30 and your Daily Mirror is the official media partner.\nEveryone who casts a vote for the benchmark awards – that honour the firms that make your time off extra special – is entered into a draw for a bonanza of fabulous holiday prizes worth more than £30,000.\nAnd one of those great giveaways is four return economy class flights to the Caribbean or South America courtesy of online travel agent opodo.co.uk and they are worth more than £3,000.\nYou could jet off for a tropical beach escape to the likes of Cuba, the Dominican Republic or Mexico.\nOr how about discovering the amazing cities and cultural sights in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay or Venezuela?\nThe hardest choice will be deciding where to go and who to invite!\nEach week in Mirror Travel we’ll highlight another great British Travel Awards prize up for grabs – but you have to be in it to win it, so make sure you get voting!\nHow it works Voting is online – britishtravelawards.com – and the ballot is scrutinised by leading accountants Deloitte.\nAnyone can vote – you do not need to have a UK address.\nThe awards have more than 70 awards categories but you do not have to vote in them all – just opt for as many or as few as you wish.\nIf you only want to vote once for the Best Holiday Company to the USA, that’s absolutely fine... it’s really that simple.\nThe online voting form also allows you to return to it as many times as you like up to September 30 to alter your votes or add new ones.\nYou’ll also get an invite to join in a survey that looks at the nation’s travel plans for 2016. It’s entirely voluntary and, like the awards voting, you can do as much or as little as\nyou wish.\nHowever, as a thank you for taking part in the survey, you’d get a bonus entry in the holiday prize draw.\nA glittering gala evening will be held in London on November 25 to announce the winners of the 2015 travel ‘Oscars’.\nTerms and conditions and voting form at britishtravelawards.com ", "external_links": ["http://britishtravelawards.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.opodo.co.uk/travel/?callback=getRedirectionUrl&_=1440689911609&utm_source=(direct)&utm_medium=(none)&utm_campaign=(direct)", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-08-29T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T18:34:04.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
