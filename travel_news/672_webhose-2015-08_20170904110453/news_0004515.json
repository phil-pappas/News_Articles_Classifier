Over 10 million people in the world’s most populated country benefitted by rural tourism between 2011-14.\nTourism is a labour-intensive sector providing a wide range of job and entrepreneurship opportunities in areas where other economic activities are often limited or in decay, said United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) Secretary General Taleb Rifai.\nThe UNWTO Secretary General met with Chinese tourism officials recently.\nCiting data from Chinese tourism authorities, the UNWTO revealed that more than 10 million people were lifted out of poverty through tourism between 2011 and 2014.\nChinese officials expect three million rural tourism businesses to receive two billion annual visitors by 2020, a figure that will allow lifting two million of China’s rural population out of poverty every year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:11:30.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
