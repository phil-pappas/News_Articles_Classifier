The shop has been out of milk and bottled water for months, but the beer shortfall is provoking a new level of irritation.\nIn this Tuesday, July 28, 2015 photo, a customer returns an empty Polar beer bottle and buys two others by another maker after Polar beers sold out at the store in Caracas, Venezuela. Starting Monday, at least two of Polar's six beer plants are closing temporarily for lack of ingredients, affecting 25% of beer production in a country with one of the highest beer consumption rates in the world.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) \"People more freaked out about losing beer than water â€” it shows how distorted our priorities have become here,\" Ramirez said.\nSome of the customers walking away empty-handed headed a few blocks down to El Tigre, a prime showcase of the country's beer culture, where people while away balmy nights with a steady stream of light beer that comes in undersized bottles to ensure it never gets warm. Waiters ran around the bar's outdoor plaza plopping down fresh drinks on plastic tables covered with dozens of empty bottles.\nEl Tigre has kept going during a heat wave that has seen temperatures soar as high as 30 C (86 F) in a month that averages 23 C (about 73 F) by buying up all the Polar beer its waiters can find at supermarkets and selling the bottles for 200 bolivars rather than the normal 150, in violation of government price controls.\nIn this Friday, July 31, 2015, a Polar beer vendor makes his last weekend delivery to a liquor store in Caracas, Venezuela.

Take away beer and things get risky.\"\nThe shortage comes at a time when Venezuelans could use a little relaxing. Tensions are running high ahead of an election that the ruling party is expected to lose badly. A supermarket looting last week left one man dead, and in July, the head of Venezuela's Liquor Store Association was arrested for unexplained reasons after denouncing the shortages of beer making materials.\nIn this Tuesday, July 28, 2015 photo, customers open their cans of Polar beer outside a liquor store in downtown Caracas, Venezuela.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) It's unclear when the national beer might start flowing again. Production cannot resume until the government approves foreign currency to import raw materials, according to Polar industrial engineer Daniela Escobar.\nPresident Nicolas Maduro has so far kept quiet on the issue, but in the past has accused Polar owner Lorenzo Mendoza of hoarding goods to create the impression that Venezuela's economy is in chaos. In February he delivered the ultimatum, \"Help our country or get out!\"\nAs with every new wave of shortages here, there's always an upside for someone. In this case, the liquor stores bearing the brunt of customers' anger could ultimately benefit as people switch from beer to whiskey or rum, which have higher profit margins. In poorer neighborhoods, resellers are buying up the remaining cases of Polar beer at government-regulated prices, and illegally selling them at a steep markup.\nIn this Tuesday, July 28, 2015 photo, an empty Polar beer bottle sits on the counter of a liquor store after it was returned by a customer in Caracas, Venezuela.

(AP Photo/Fernando Llano) Venezuelans can still opt for one of the imported or locally-made artisanal beers still found in liquor stores. But with Heineken going for more than five times the price of Polar, it doesn't seem likely many will switch to a posher alternative.\n\"If they're only selling Heineken, they're not selling beer,\" said college student Jose Vera, who went home to drink rum after failing to find Polar at liquor stores Thursday.\nEven though he kicked off the weekend beer-free, Vera didn't seem too worried.\n\"Elections are coming and they'll figure it out. No one is going to risk their office over this,\" he said.\n___\nFind Hannah Dreier on Twitter: https://twitter.com/hannahdreier", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/07/21/d1/aef66daaa479478f84306715312a4f7c-48495e38ab874fa3a70763f09d7013e5-0.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/07/fe/23/aef66daaa479478f84306715312a4f7c-ae74026d650c4aa6ae05f41a511c4b75-3_1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/07/a5/2e/aef66daaa479478f84306715312a4f7c-ae74026d650c4aa6ae05f41a511c4b75-2_1.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hannahdreier", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/07/fd/ae/aef66daaa479478f84306715312a4f7c-ae74026d650c4aa6ae05f41a511c4b75-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-07T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:19:11.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
