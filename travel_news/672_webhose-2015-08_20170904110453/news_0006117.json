Though it's not just the young who seek out frames that wouldn't seem out of places in the 60s. From the eclectic fashion icon Iris Apfel to the Italian film star Sophia Loren and everyone in between, it isn't uncommon to see a pair of brightly coloured or large spectacles framing the face of an older woman. Andie White, a buyer at Glasses Direct , says the appeal of retro-vintage eyewear for older women comes from a love of more vintage shapes: \"When we segment our customers by age we find the younger ones like more streamlined frames and older ones have a stronger interest in decoration.\" \"They also favour strong vintage shapes like, for example, cats eyes.\" Italian actress Sophia Loren, 80, is often seen with her unique frames (Invision) Glasses Direct have noticed that 60 per cent of the top 15 glasses sold on the site are different for female customers over the age of 40, compared to their younger ones. Statistics show women over 40 are increasingly preferring bolder frames: \"What is noteworthy is that in particular the arms of the glasses chosen are quite bold and have special design features. This indicates that our more distinguished female customers are proud to wear glasses and use them as fashion statement.\" Cat-eye frames were particularly popular in the 50s, which is why they remain in favour with older women today according to Steenie, the owner of Soho's The Eye Company : “In the early 20th century, eyewear was very much seen as an appliance you wore if you suffered from bad eyesight. In the postwar years, however, styles became much more designed to flatter face shapes, hence the cat-eyes of the 50s. The upsweep worked beautifully with the cheek line. “Of course, those women carried on wearing those glasses because they looked so good, until they became old women, and we associate those cat-eyes with snippy old ladies.\" Alyson Walsh, author of Style Forever: How To Look Fabulous Every Age and the fashion blog That's Not My Age , says \"kooky\" looking glasses are a style essential for older women: \"With clothes you develop a uniform of sorts - the figure flattering essentials you pull on everyday - so kooky glasses and sunglasses are an easy way to liven things up.\" \"When you're looking for glasses you want something that suits both your face and personality, and they also help add to it as well and give you a chance to express yourself. Glasses are a neat way to standout, and there are so many fantastic styles around. Quirky glasses and statement trainers are two style essentials for older women.\" A wonderful morning with Alejandro Moreno, Winky and a precious plume of Layla's in my pocket.

Like Linda, when Catherine Summers, creator of the over 40s style blog Not Dressed As Lamb , looks for new glasses, she looks for designs that make a statement: \"Whether it's a bold shape or an unusual colour or pattern, I think that as you get older it's important to wear glasses that are true to your style and your personality.\" \"I especially like two-tone glasses at the moment, and although I think I know the best shaped frame for my face right now, it's important to keep one eye on current trends so as not to look dated. I love that older style icons like Iris Apfel and Linda Rodin make bold glasses an important part of their looks. I have every intention of being more adventurous every time I need a new pair, so who knows what I'll be wearing by the time I'm 70?\" Best eyegrabbing glasses ASOS Handmade, ASOS ; £38 London Retro Loren; Glasses Direct ; £125 Miu Miu; MyTheresa ; £255 telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:50:26.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
