As such, there are no pictures in the \"Forever Remembered\" exhibit of Challenger breaking apart in the Florida sky nearly 30 years ago or Columbia debris raining down on Texas 12 years ago.\nSince the tragic re-entry, Columbia's scorched remains have been stashed in off-limits offices at the space centre. But NASA had to pry open the underground tomb housing Challenger's pieces -- a pair of abandoned missile silos at neighbouring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station -- to retrieve the section of fuselage now on display.\nThe exhumation was conducted in secrecy. Everything about the exhibit, in fact, was kept hush-hush during the four years it took to complete the project, out of respect to the dead astronauts' families.\nJune Scobee Rodgers had never seen an actual remnant of her husband's destroyed shuttle, Challenger, until previewing the exhibit just before its low-key opening at the end of June.\nDisplayed in a dimly lit room: a 12-foot section of the left side body panel of Challenger, standing vertically and bearing the gouged and scraped but still brilliantly colorful U.S. flag, and the charred frames for Columbia's cockpit windows, seemingly floating at eye level.\n\"Sad, yes,\" to see the wreckage but it is \"a wonderful memorial\" to the shuttles, Scobee Rodgers said. The items representing the astronauts, on the other hand, are a \"truly fitting\" reminder of who they were as individuals.\nChallenger commander Francis \"Dick\" Scobee's display case, on the left side of the exhibit's main corridor, contains the leather helmet from the Starduster biplane he and June used to fly, and his blue \"TFNG\" T-shirt from the Astronaut Class of 1978, nicknamed the Thirty-Five New Guys.\nAcross the hall on the right are Columbia commander Rick Husband's scuffed cowboy boots and well-worn Bible opened to Proverbs. There's a display case for each astronaut, filled with personal items, although not all families contributed, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe's.\n\"Forever Remembered\" is a permanent exhibit, part of a larger display centred on the retired space shuttle Atlantis. NASA opted to keep Atlantis at Kennedy, the shuttle launch site, after Atlantis closed the program with the final mission in 2011.\nThe entrance to the new exhibit is directly beneath the nose of Atlantis, which is suspended with its payload bay doors wide open as though perpetually orbiting Earth.\nOne recent afternoon in July, tourists filled the predominantly blue hallway, pausing in front of the astronaut display cases. One woman wondered aloud which shuttle burned up and which one blew up. A few young children scampered about, their parents shushing them given the solemnity of the place.\nA few weeks after visiting the exhibit, Scobee Rodgers noted in a phone interview that much of the world's population wasn't even born yet when Challenger went down in 1986.\n\"It's mostly history for the general public. It's very personal for us,\" she said.\nAmber DiSalvatore -- an Apopka, Florida, resident touring the space centre with her husband and two children -- was 4 years old at the time of Challenger. Seeing the actual wreckage -- along with Husband's Bible -- brought tears to her eyes.\nThe astronauts sacrificed their lives for exploration, said DiSalvatore, \"so it's something that everybody -- every human being -- should know.\"\nIn the aftermath of the Feb. 1, 2003, Columbia accident, NASA meticulously stored the 42 tons of debris in Kennedy's iconic Vehicle Assembly Building and made them available for research. The space agency displayed a remnant or two of Columbia in a restricted area of the space centre and, for the fifth anniversary, organized a travelling in-house exhibit. The relics were intended as safety reminders for the workforce. The three surviving shuttles -- Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour, Challenger's replacement -- still were flying then.\nAfter Challenger's accident, NASA wanted it out of sight and out of mind. The Jan. 28, 1986, launch disaster unfolded on live TV before countless schoolchildren eager to see an everyday teacher rocketing toward space. And so Challenger's wreckage -- all 118 tons of it, salvaged from the Atlantic -- was buried in the pair of former missile silos, 90 feet deep.\nThe chamber containing this particular fuselage section, in fact, had never been opened -- until the \"Forever Remembered\" exhibit began to take shape.\nDetermined to avoid any hint of commercialism or sensationalism, NASA took charge of the memorial effort at the visitor complex, which is run by an outside company. The job fell to Michael Ciannilli, a shuttle engineer and test director who had become responsible for the Challenger and Columbia debris.\n\"Our biggest concern the whole time was doing the right thing,\" Ciannilli said. \"Is this the right time? Is this the right thing?\"\nAs the conversations unfolded over the months then years, Ciannilli entered the underground storage silos to find the proper display piece to represent Challenger.\n\"I was hoping to find something that would show the beauty of Challenger, the dignity of Challenger, the strength of Challenger, and these are words I don't use lightly,\" Ciannilli said.\nThe 12-foot section of fuselage with the flag fit the bill. For Columbia, he chose the cockpit window frames. He said it's like gazing into the eyes of Columbia and thus its soul.\nCiannilli tapped the same preservation company that had worked on the Titanic, for the Challenger and Columbia relics. He sought out soothing, uplifting music for the exhibit.\nAnd, yes, he deliberately kept out real-time scenes of the shuttles disintegrating.\n\"There's more to this story\" than those awful final moments, he said. \"Great pains were taken not to have anything sensationalized or exploited.\"\nAbove all else, Ciannilli wanted the end result to be respectful.\n\"I can't stop thinking about it,\" Evelyn Husband-Thompson, the widow of Columbia's commander, confided in a NASA interview. \"As you walk in, you know that you're in a special place.\"\nONLINE\nKennedy Space Center Visitor Complex: https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/", "external_links": ["https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/"], "published": "2015-08-08T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T07:21:48.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
