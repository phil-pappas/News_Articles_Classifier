The revelation comes amid allegations of financial mismanagement by Camila Batmanghelidjh as pressure grows for charities to be more accountable. The Charity Commission confirmed to the Daily Telegraph it is looking into allegations by the charity’s former employees of “inappropriate spending” but it said it is not a formal investigation at this point and that no firm conclusion has been reached. However, the Mail on Sunday reported the charity helped finance a spot for the teenage daughter of Jeton Cavolli, her personal chauffeur, at Dauntsey’s School where fees reach nearly £30,000 a year. It is understood the investigation was started last month after former employees brought their concerns to the Commission that the monetary arrangement may not have represented the best use of the funds. A spokesman with the Charity Commission said: “A number of allegations made by former employees of the charity are currently being examined as part of our ongoing compliance case. “The Commission was contacted by former employees of the charity and met them on 16 July to discuss specific concerns about alleged inappropriate spending, breaches of financial controls and concerns about the viability of the organisation. These include some specific allegations that the Mail on Sunday have outlined to us. We notified the charity of the complaints on 17 July and met with charity representatives on 21 July.” It also follows that rock band Coldplay are believed to be in talks to rescue the disgraced charity in a multimillion-pound rescue deal to help the fortunes of hundreds of children left abandoned by its collapse. The embattled charity was force to shut down last week following concerns over the mishandling of funds. However, since its closure hundreds of youth have been left vulnerable. Ms Batmanghelidjh has said she could prove to the Charity Commission that no funds had been paid by Kids Company to the school to cover academic fees because the school covered the costs via a bursary. Ms Batmanghelidjh was not immediately available for comment. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T17:23:34.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
