In comparison, Chinese T&E budgets have maintained a steady growth rate of 5 percent over the last two quarters. \nThe bullish growth in T&E budgets by Indian and Chinese corporates is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where T&E budgets grew by a more conservative 3.7 percent. Corporates in Indonesia and Malaysia have begun cutting back on their T&E budgets. \nEvolving T&E Spending \nThis comes amidst a shift in T&E spend behavior, with a majority of corporates facing increasing pressure on budgets. \nThe report also shows further shifts in how and where T&E is allocated, with the proportion of spend being allocated to conferences and events versus “normal business travel”, as large corporates across the region continue their hunt for return on these investments. \nAt the same time, the report has also uncovered corporates actively developing deeper involvement with intermediaries in managing their T&E spending, moving away from in-house management. \nDarryl Ye, Head of Market Analysis for East & Partners Asia, commented that the change in T&E spend is presenting new opportunities for both hospitality providers and event organizers in the region. \n“T&E spending typically follows the flow of trade. Intra-Asia trade volumes have been growing consistently over the last few year, and East certainly expects T&E spending within Asia to grow concurrently with these trade flows” Ye said. \n“As these corporates continue to shift their focus within Asia, providers with a keen Asian flavor in their offering will stand to benefit the most from this developing trend by corporates.” \nCorporate T&E Budget in Asia Percentage change in T&E Budgets for Q2/Q2 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:56:16.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
