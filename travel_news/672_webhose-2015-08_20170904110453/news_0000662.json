The clocks are all set to Beijing time, Mandarin and other Chinese dialects are commonplace and the main currency is the yuan. \nFew of the employees are Laotian. Most are Chinese or from Myanmar. \nFor impoverished, landlocked and isolated Laos, the zone is a much needed source of income. \nChinese money runs throughout the Laos economy. It is the nation's biggest investor with rail, roads and hydropower among China's main interests. \nBut observers say the inflow of cash has come at a cost – including serious environmental damage and the displacement of landless poor to make way for mega-projects. \nObservers say the SEZ has now become a place to wash dirty money from China as well as local criminal networks, with fears the 99-year lease will only cement that status. \nThe Golden Triangle has long been known for its drug production. In previous decades it produced some of the world's most sought after heroin. \nIn more recent years many of the drug syndicates have switched to lab-produced crystal meth and other synthetic highs, according to a recent United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report. \n\"Cash-based commercial activities such as casinos, currency exchange shops or even just restaurants offer better opportunities to introduce in the legitimate economy money obtained through illegal activities,\" warns Giovanni Brossard, from the UNODC. \nLaos has moved to crack down on money laundering, Brossard notes, with laws against the crime and by setting up a financial intelligence unit within the country's state bank. \n\"Yet so far no single money laundering case has made it to court,\" he says. \n\"Sauteed tiger meat\" \nAlongside gambling a whole host of other bacchanalian industries have sprung up to cater to punters looking to play away from prying eyes in their homelands. \nSex workers openly ply their trade on the sidewalks or at the myriad massage parlours. \n\"People love to come here with friends and book private rooms,\" explains a Chinese member of staff at a disco near the casino. \n\"Most are men and they bring in girls.\" \nConservationists say the SEZ also caters to those with illegal culinary tastes. \nA recent probe by campaign group the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) found visitors could openly buy products from endangered species including tigers, leopards, elephants, rhinos and bears. \nRestaurants offered sauteed tiger meat, bear paws and live pangolins on their menus. \n\"One business kept a live python and a bear cub in cages, both of which were available to eat on request,\" the NGO's investigators found. \nDuring AFP 's visit in early April, the businesses allegedly unmasked by the EIA investigation were no longer open. \nAs a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Laos is supposedly committed to stopping illegal wildlife trafficking and clamping down on the illegal ivory trade. \nBut the convention is widely flouted. \nAnimal rights workers say both Laos and China have a responsibility to ensure the special economic zone does not become a haven for the illicit wildlife trade. \n\"The Chinese businesses and consumers are exploiting weak enforcement in Laos, but the Laos government can't pretend they are ignorant of what is going on,\" says Debbie Banks, from EIA. – AFP Relaxnews Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T08:52:28.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
