Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo (pehn-TAN'-jeh-loh) says 40-year-old Maxie Oquendo was arrested Thursday night. Prosecutors say Oquendo approached the 21-year-old woman on Aug. 25 as she was coming off a flight from Salt Lake City. They say he told her she needed to undergo a \"secondary security screening.\" Authorities say the woman was brought to a bathroom, told her to raise her arms and was then molested. Oquendo was arrested on unlawful imprisonment, sexual abuse and other charges. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney who could comment on the arrest. The TSA says the officer has been fired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T03:29:37.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
