(Photo: Dollywood) \nBuckle your seat-belts — things at Dollywood are about to take off! \nToday, Dolly Parton and Co. unveiled a new ride that will be the the fastest wooden roller coaster in the world. Lightning Rod is set to roll in March 2016, and will travel at speeds up to 73 mph. \nIn addition to being the fastest, Lightning Rod will also be the world’s first launching wood coaster. Launched coasters initiate the ride with high amounts of acceleration, Lighting rod will use 1500 horse power to propel riders up a 20-story high first launch. \nThe ride will feature 12 cars carrying two passengers each, and will have a variety of ups, downs, twists, and turns. Some of the more unique features include twin summit airtime hills, a 90-degree outside banked turn, and a startling 165-foot drop. \nDuring the ride, guests will experience nearly 20 seconds of airtime. (Photo: Dollywood) \nFor Dolly, launching the speedy coaster is not just about attracting new visitors (although it undoubtedly will), instead, she has a personal connection with 1950′s era hot rods. “Lighting Rod reminds me so much of those color cars crusin’ up and down Main Street in Sevierville back when I was in high school,” she told the crowd. “I’m truly excited about this ride because it will let our guests experience something just as fast as those hot rods I remember.” \nAlthough she loves fast cars, roller coasters are another story. \n“I get motion sickness, I’m chicken…it scares me to death,” she explained. “Plus, I’m afraid I’ll lose my hair.” \nIn addition to thrills, Lightning Rod also comes with a hefty price tag. The Dollywood Company dropped $22 million on the project —the most they’ve ever spent on a single attraction. \nWATCH: Dolly Parton Dishes on Her Fear of Roller Coasters \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
