If you are planning to move abroad, you will probably be looking for information about travelling with your pets. What can you expect? How much will it cost? And what can you do to limit the amount of stress that your beloved pet will experience during the flight? Let's find out. \nThe basics \nWhen it comes to international flights, the majority of pets (aside from service dogs) are not allowed in the cabin and must be placed in the cargo hold instead. Fear not, though. The animals are kept in a separate portion of the hold, where it is heated and pressurised for their safety and comfort. They will be placed in a crate that abides by IATA regulations (it is the owner's responsibility to provide this crate). Once they get used to the new sounds that surround them, most fur babies will settle down to sleep. \nHow much does it cost to fly with your pet(s)? \nThe flight costs are relatively reasonable and depend on the size of the animal crate that is being transported. Smaller dogs and cats are therefore cheaper to transport than larger ones. However, there will also be additional veterinary costs, quarantine costs, and pet-travel agent costs involved, depending on the area to which you are moving. All countries have different rules, regulations and entry requirements which is why it is recommended that you make use of the services of a pet travel agent. Not only will they help to streamline the process leading up to the move (they will also clear your pet for you at customs), but they will also help to keep both you and your pet calm throughout the planning process. \nWhat can you do to limit the amount of stress that your pet experiences? \nWhether you are booking flights to London from Johannesburg, or flights to New York from Cape Town, both you and your fur babies have a long journey ahead of you. So how do you help to make that journey as comfortable and as stress-free as possible? Here are some tips: Ensure that your pet has time to familiarise himself / herself with the crate in which he / she will be travelling. Introduce your fur baby to the crate a few weeks in advance and make sure that he / she associates it with feelings of calm and safety. Consider investing in a calming collar. These collars utilise aromatherapy to keep animals serene during stressful situations - and they last for months! Allow your pet to wear the collar for at least a week before the flight. Place an old piece of your clothing inside your animal's crate. Your scent will help to soothe him / her. Take your pet(s) on a long walk before taking them to the airport. If they are tired, they will be more likely to relax and sleep through the flight. Do NOT sedate your pet before the flight. This is very dangerous as they will not be able to regulate their breathing and adapt to the change in air pressure. If your pets have been sedated, they will not be accepted onto the plane. \nTravelling with your pets need not cause you mountains of stress. Just be sure to do the right amount of preparation beforehand, and make certain that the animals meet the entry requirements of the country in question, and all should go smoothly. Happy travels!
