This is stark in contrast to JW Marriott Marquis, which has witnessed an increase in demand of more than 40 percent,\" he said. \n\"As a result, JW Marriott Marquis Dubai has continued to drive room revenues by 21 percent. These positive figures further cement our position as a market leader in the region, as we continue to set the precedent for hospitality industry standards both in the Middle East and internationally.\" \nOperating 1,608 rooms and offering over 8,000 square metres of indoor and outdoor event space, the hotel is the tallest in the world and flagship in the globally renowned Marriott International portfolio. \nThe hotel boasts nine restaurants, five lounges, a spa, health club and two ballrooms and 32 meeting rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:35:41.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
