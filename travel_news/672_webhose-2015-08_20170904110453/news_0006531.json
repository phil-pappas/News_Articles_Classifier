Managing director Phil Ward said they had been escorted away by police.\nBoth have been given a six month ban from flying with the airline and using the holiday company - a decision Joseph, 23, said was completely unfair.\nScroll down for video\nJoseph Kings (left) and his friend Reiss Edgerton were angry at not being allowed onto their Jet2 flight to the party island of Ibiza\nIn a statement the airline said: 'Prior to reaching the aircraft the pair were observed being rude towards airport security staff, deliberately shoving fellow passengers and threatening Jet2.com employees .\n'Their behaviour got so aggressive that the local police had to step in and escort them back through the airport. In addition to being offloaded, both were given a six-month ban from flying with Jet2.com and Jet2holidays.\n'Jet2.com is leading discussions within the industry on how to tackle this growing problem together.'\n Is this the future of holiday homes? Space-age tower set in... From TOWIE to Downton Abbey: The best of Britain's TV... 'Highway to the Danger Zone!' Moment Southwest Airlines crew... They won't visit odd numbered homes which have been burgled... Mr Kings, 23, from Bromsgrove claimed he had been the victim of an airline official who seemed to have a 'vendetta' against him and his friend - and claimed he had not behaved badly in any way.\nHe said: 'Me and a group of friends were flying to Ibiza at 7.15 in the morning. We were all looking ahead to the trip but when we got through to the gate they had this really strange woman who worked at Jet 2 and she seemed really out of sorts and annoyed at anyone and anything.\nJoseph Kings has blamed a stewardess for having a 'vendetta' against him and his friend after they were denied boarding a Jet2 flight to Ibiza\nJET2'S ZERO TOLERANCE TOWARDS MISBEHAVIOUR Jet2.com has already put in place a series of measures under its 'Onboard Together' programme, to educate passengers about the effects of alcohol at high altitude, and to outline its policies.\nIt has empowered its staff to take decisions quickly regarding disruptive passengers including verbal and written warnings and, ultimately, the ability to divert the aircraft to the nearest airport to off-load particularly offensive people before flying remaining passengers onto their holiday destination.\nMeasures also include banning disruptive passengers for life, handing them over to the police, issuing a bill for the cost of the diversion and taking legal action, post travel.\n'She told us to be quiet and we said 'yeah ok' and went upstairs to Burger King, we knew there had been a lot of complaints on flights to Ibiza so we literally sat there in silence for the next half an hour.\n'We had something to eat and were literally about to get on the plane when she came over and told me and my mate to get out of the queue.\n'She didn't have a reason, at first we thought she was going to make us wait and get on last. 'It was quite shocking, she was saying she was going to make sure we didn't get our money back, it was like we were back at school and she was on a power trip.\n'We weren't going to get down on our hands and knees and beg to get on a flight we'd already paid for.\n'It felt like begging for a burger you'd already paid for at McDonald's.'\nThe pair flew out to the Balearic isle two days later with Ryanair and returned with Thomson, as Jet2.com has banned them from its flights for six months. Joseph, from Bromsgrove, said: 'They said we were escorted out by police but that never happened.\n'We did speak to a policeman outside the airport who agreed that we had been dealt with unfairly and took it upon himself to go back inside and make our case.\n'I have his badge number and name.\n'We dispute what Jet 2 have said 100 per cent and have asked for CCTV, which they have denied us.'\nLads on tour erupt into a not so tuneful song on flight to Ibiza Jet2 stand by the decision taken by the stewardess who refused to allow the two men to board the flight\nThe agricultural worker says he plans legal action over the extra costs of the missed flight, the damage to his reputation and wants an explanation over the actions of the ground steward.\nHe said: 'It was unbelievable, I've been on flights to Ibiza before and there are people on there shouting and being aggressive and we've been kicked off for nothing.\n'The woman had a vendetta against us, it was completely out the blue and she was acting like a headteacher. It feels as if we've been singled out.'\nMr Edgerton has said on Twitter that he also plans legal action against the airline. Jet2.com referred to its 'Onboard Together' pledge to passengers and crew that it will not stand for disruptive behaviour.\nThe two men had to book a Ryanair flight out to Ibiza two days later after being banned by Jet2\nJet2.com managing director Phil Ward said: 'We are a leisure airline and we simply won't stand for such rude and disrespectful behaviour.\n'Many passengers on the flight were families travelling with young children, so there was no way we were going to expose them to this aggressive and abusive pair.\n'Their attitude was completely unnecessary. Ultimately, they ruined their holiday because of how they acted.\n'We are determined to take a proactive stance on behalf of the industry, our loyal customers and staff.\n'We want holidaymakers to know that we are a family-friendly airline that will not tolerate yobbish behaviour.' No action was taken against the pair by police.\nLast month MailOnline reported on the two passengers banned for life by Jet2 after their anti-social behaviour was described as one of the 'worst cases' ever seen on a passenger plane.\nPaul Strain and Kevin Brady were travelling together on a flight from Glasgow Airport to Dalaman on July 13.\nA third person, Claire Marshall, who was travelling on the same flight, has been handed a six-month ban for her part in the mid-air chaos.\nAfter the three passengers were found consuming alcohol they had sneaked on board, and were consequently refused drinks from the bar, the party verbally abused the cabin crew.\nThe obscene language, led by Strain and Brady, allegedly continued throughout the flight undeterred by verbal and written warnings from the crew.\nBrady sang loudly and danced down the aisle, stripped off his T-shirt and made vulgar sexual gestures, thrusting at a member of the cabin crew and then throughout the cabin, in full view of families with children.\nWhen firmly asked to sit down, it is claimed he spat in the face of the senior cabin crew while physically blocking the walk-way along with torrents of verbal and threatening abuse\nTHE PARTY STARTS BEFORE THE PLANE HAS LANDED IN IBIZA A video emerged last month of passengers raving on board a Glasgow to Ibiza flight, forcing cabin crew to plead with the holidaymakers not to swear in front of children.\nThe flight was en route to the party island when those on board burst into song, belting out club classic 'Look Right Through' by Storm Queen.\nOne of the passengers used a speaker or handheld device to blast the song so everyone on board could hear it, and soon a host of people turn the flight into their own personal party.\nPassengers rave on flight to Ibiza for rowdy behaviour This led to a flight attendant to say over the tannoy system: 'Ladies and gentlemen, please remain quiet. There are travellers on board with young children. Please do not swear. Thank you.'\nBut it appears many of those on board were keen to get the party started even before they had set foot in the haven for raving, that hosts clubs such as Amnesia, Space and Pacha.\nAnd of course phones were at the ready to record the impromptu rave.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MeBpRW"], "published": "2015-08-07T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:58:28.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
