Jon Krakauer, author of “Into Thin Air” says the ill-fated 1996 Mount Everest expedition he joined as a writer for Outside magazine was the “biggest mistake” of his life.\n“Into Thin Air” is perhaps his best known book and features his Mount Everest expedition story. However, he says ‘if I could go back and relive my life, I never would have climbed Everest.’\nIn an interview to HuffPost he said, “”I wish I’d never gone,” I suffered for years with (post-traumatic stress disorder), still suffer from what happened.”\nKrakauer went on the Mount Everest expedition in May 1996 during which a severe storm roared over the world’s highest peak killing four members of Krakauer’s expedition, along with several climbers from other groups.\n“I’m the last person should tell people not to do crazy s**t, but think twice about it,” he said.\nKrakauer said Everest is unlike any other mountain, one unusually dangerous even for a sport synonymous with danger and difficulty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:26:55.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
