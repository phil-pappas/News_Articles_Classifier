In this way, Volkswagen is linking its activities in China to collaboration with its other international partners. Since 2011, there has been a close partnership between Volkswagen Group of America and MoMA as well as MoMA PS1. Additionally, Volkswagen Group has maintained a partnership with the Nationalgalerie-Staatliche Museen zu Berlin since 2013. \nProf. Dr Jochem Heizmann said at the opening: \"Art and culture are the driving force behind innovation, because often it is above all artists who manage to ask questions which awaken the urge for new discoveries. Volkswagen therefore promotes interaction with creative work with the greatest conviction. By supporting this exhibition, we will provide the starting signal to establish a creative platform which offers people new inspiration and provides an interesting perspective on the significance of environmental sustainability.\" \nWith Rain Room, the artist group Random International has created an installation which combines technology and creative interaction in a unique way. Rain Room is a room in which it is constantly raining. \nAs soon as people move inside the room, however, the rain is interrupted precisely at these points. This makes highly-developed digital control possible which provides an unexpected refuge for the visitor in the middle of torrential rain. Rain Room was first displayed in London and subsequently in the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). At the arrangement of Volkswagen, the idea matured to give the Chinese public the opportunity to experience this work. This idea was finally implemented together with the YUZ Foundation. \nThe YUZ Museum Shanghai exhibits Rain Room from 1 September to 31 December 2015 within the framework of a project partnership with Volkswagen Group China. The exhibition is supplemented with artistic learning opportunities for different ages which were also developed by YUZ Museum with the support of Volkswagen Group China. Volkswagen Group China will additionally invite Chinese users to reflect individually on the topic of water using various online channels in order to connect awareness of art and the environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T19:50:19.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
