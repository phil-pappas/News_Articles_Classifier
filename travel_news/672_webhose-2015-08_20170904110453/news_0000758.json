Not because there is a favourable astrological conjunction of planets at that time, it's a simple matter of sexual expression. Not the x-rated, intimate kind, but a very public, lunar-induced affair. \nAs the golden orb lights up Ningaloo Reef, some 250 different species of coral polyp respond to a timeless reproductive urge and release egg and sperm clusters that explode into a planktonic cloud of pink soup. \nOn a glorious, sun-filled day that residents of the golden state take for granted, I slip off a dive boat into the salubrious embrace of the Indian Ocean in a pleasantly relaxed state of mind. Suddenly out of the dark veil of the depths a huge grey shape emerges. It has a chillingly familiar shark-shaped profile, preceded by a gaping, cavernous mouth with 300 teeth. \nSnorkellers get up close and personal with a whale shark. \nMy silent scream is lost in the deep. \"If I don't move quickly that great mouth will swallow me whole,\" is the only rational thought I can muster. A frantic finning response takes me clear, but a long, drooping pectoral fin brushes against my chest as the 6-metre-long whale shark glides past. \nThe vast flank of the gentle giant reminds me of a granite mountain slope. It rises to a curved prominence, which must be the dorsal fin, but it has the appearance of a submarine conning tower. \nThe largest fish in the ocean has never been known to attack humans but still I give the mighty tail fluke a wide berth as he swims away into the dark void. He leaves behind a few pink blobs of coral spawn, dancing in the shafts of sunlight in this enchantingly beautiful underwater world. Ad Feedback \nThe highlight of this close encounter is seeing the checkerboard pattern of white star-bursts over the shark's body, shimmering like a miniature Milky Way galaxy. Nasa scientists used photos of star clusters to guide the Hubble space craft. The same technology is now used to identify the whale sharks as their star patterns are as individual as fingerprints. \nStill glowing with the exhilaration of my magical meeting on Ningaloo Reef, I fly 300 kilometres south to Monkey Mia. This delightful resort graces the shores of Shark Bay, Australia's largest bay and home to the prolific and menacing tiger shark, who does not share the congenial disposition of his star-crossed cousin. Fortunately the shallow sea grass plains of this vast bay provide a refuge for more angelic aquatic creatures. \nFeeding dolphins at Monkey Mia. \nDawn breaks quickly over Monkey Mia, the rising sun creating a pathway of gold from the silky-smooth Indian Ocean across the beach to my breakfast table. I feel strangely moved this morning as I have a rendezvous with eight friendly dolphins. \nAt precisely 7.30am I make my way down to the shore. Gentle waves slide up the white sand with a soothing whisper. Then in the blink of an eye I see dorsal fins skimming inshore in a magical fluid motion. The magnificent wild dolphins of Monkey Mia are coming home from the sea. \nWith military precision a small group of humans line up in a silent vigil, wide-eyed and eager to welcome home our mammalian next of fin. The wildlife rangers stand with their buckets of baitfish, poised and ready for the welcoming ceremony. \nSuddenly dolphins are everywhere, rolling on their backs, nodding their beaks (known as rostrums) and eyeballing the phalanx of human devotees as if to say, \"OK cobber, don't muck around, where's the tucker!\" \nThe high point of my personal cetacean bonding comes as I step eagerly forward to take two silver pilchards and offer them to a sleek female named Nicky, who is well bred and schooled in social etiquette and good table manners. \nI barely notice the pull of her glistening beak as she takes my offering. Nicky is cajoling and pleading for more tasty morsels, nuzzling against my leg and releasing a staccato burst of whistles and squeaks. \nThe rangers apply some gentle counselling in the form of an upended bucket of water, the signal that breakfast is over. Nicky and her calf Yule leap out of the water in perfect formation, hovering for an instant then splashing back – an instinctive expression of the joy of living in Shark Bay \nThe human actors in this cross-species drama drift away with broad smiles on their faces. I marvel at the intelligence of these lovable dolphins. They have succeeded in training the planet's most notorious predator to line up at the water's edge and provide a free gourmet breakfast. The dolphins must be laughing all the way to the sand bank. \nThere are many more mysteries of the shallows to discover in Shark Bay. Circling the bay in a sleek catamaran, I meet a female dolphin performing an amazing feat. She has picked up a soft, cone-shaped sponge and is carrying it on her beak as a protection against cuts and abrasions as she forages for food on the seabed. This is the only known example of a marine mammal using a tool. \nThe loggerhead turtle is the most endangered turtle that nests in Australia. \nLater I take an \"Aqua Rush\" excursion to find a mermaid. The dugongs (nature's only vegetarian mammals) were the mythical mermaids that lured ancient mariners to their doom. \nTwo dugongs raise their seal-like, bewhiskered, stubby snouts and view us with curiosity and disdain. These rotund road-humps of the ocean munch contentedly all day long, enjoying the luxury of being placid, defenceless and not engagingly feminine. Maybe the ancient mariners exceeded their rum ration! \nA large loggerhead turtle pops its head out of the sea to say hello, which is right neighbourly but unwise. This species is the most endangered turtle that nests in Australia. The females lay up to 150 eggs on the beach at regular intervals. Hatchlings run the gauntlet on their journey to the sea. These little Aussie battlers might outsmart the crafty fox at times, but winged marauders like the silver gulls, sea eagles and ospreys take no prisoners. \nCruising slowly back from Steep Point, Australia's westernmost promontory, we meet two of the big black \"stealth bombers\" that patrol the bay The 2-metre-wide manta rays are quite menacing as they glide purposefully alongside the boat. They're sending an explicit message: \"Don't mess with me!\" In reality they lack the necessary hardware to threaten, having no tail sting. Apparently they have the temperament of cute puppy dogs but I resist the urge to stroke them. \nIt has been a rewarding experience to have these close encounters with gentle giants, hypnotically graceful swimmers and slow, lumbering herbivores. In all the vastness of Western Australia I couldn't have found more fascinating places than Ningaloo Reef and Shark Bay. \nPaul Rush travelled to Western Australia courtesy of Tourism Australia and Qantas. \nFact file \nGetting there Air New Zealand flies direct from Auckland to Perth and Qantas flies to Perth via Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Skywest has frequent flights from Perth to Exmouth. By road it is a journey of 1200km on excellent sealed roads. Exmouth Bus Charter provides local transport and day tours of the Cape Range National Park. \nStaying there The Novotel Ningaloo Reef sits majestically on Sunrise Beach and offers luxury suites in a totally smoke-free atmosphere. novotel.com.au An interesting eco-camping alternative is the Ningaloo Reef Retreat, which offers comfortable wilderness tents on an isolated beach, with queen-size bed, sofa and ensuite facilities. \nBeing there Ningaloo Reef is one of the world's largest fringing coral reefs, stretching 260km and coming close to the shore in places. With depths of 100 metres occurring within 6km of the coastline, it attracts oceanic species. Several companies operate whale shark eco-tour day trips with a maximum of 20 passengers from April to June. Pick-up time is normally 7.30am, returning at 4.30pm. All interaction is by snorkelling only, so no special qualifications are needed. It pays to allow an extra day as on rare occasions a whale shark sighting does not occur. One repeat tour free of charge is offered if this happens. ningalooblue.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T20:03:52.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
