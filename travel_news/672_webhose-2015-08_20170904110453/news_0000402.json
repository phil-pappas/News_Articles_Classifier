The 29th SAACI Annual Congress is currently underway at the Westin Cape Town. \nMs. Corné Koch, Head of the Cape Town & Western Cape Convention Bureau, a strategic unit of Wesgro, the Western Cape’s official tourism, trade and investment promotion agency was proud of the destination’s performance both on a domestic as well as international level. \n“In today’s competitive business events environment, retaining this award is a special feat and thanks must be given to the bureau team for their tireless efforts in keeping the bureau relevant and delivering on its mandate. This award is the result of a concerted effort between stakeholders and partners within the industry to work together. Without a dynamic product and service offering and unwavering professionalism in the industry, wining this award would not have been possible,” says Koch. \nCandidates were nominated by a SAACI member in order to qualify. The outcome was then purely based on member votes to determine the actual winner of the award. \n“I wish to thank SAACI for nominating the bureau and for their votes. Without awards such as these, the sector cannot aim to maintain and improve standards. Congratulations must also go out to the other nominee in the category; the Gauteng Convention Bureau, who provided stiff competition. We would also like to congratulate the Cape Town International Convention Centre for winning the category of best convention centre in South Africa.” Koch added. \nCape Town is fast becoming Africa’s business events hub, also retaining its ranking as the number one destination for business events in Africa as per results released by the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) Country and City rankings earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:48:29.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
