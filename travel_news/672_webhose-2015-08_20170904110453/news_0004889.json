On top of that, some vestiges of the Cold War era and a little skiing history are thrown in. \nSome level of fitness is required for most of the hikes to take around the wide-open valley — unless you try the super-easy Muktuk Marston Trail, which is no more than a half-mile long. \nYet visitors can still get an eyeful of green, rolling terrain even if they just hang around the day lodge across from the parking lot. \nA short hike up from the lodge, red vintage ski lifts sit idle until winter, when they operate through the Anchorage Ski Club. And if your visit is timed right, you could arrive just as fat, juicy blueberries are ripening. \nIn the distance are the partially refurbished clamshell radar towers that were once part of the national Nike Hercules missile-site system established at 145 locations in Alaska and the lower 48 states. \nAt Arctic Valley, the Nike Site Summit was activated between 1959 and 1979. It is the only site to survive in an almost complete state, according to Friends of Nike Site Summit, a citizen preservation group that occasionally conducts group tours. \nBe forewarned: You can’t hike to the long deactivated radars. That would be trespassing onto military property, as posted signs will tell you. \nThe Cold War relics are just part of the scenery encountered along my favorite Arctic Valley hike — a 11/4-mile trek to an aerial view of the Anchorage suburb of Eagle River. At the start of each summer, I am reminded that reaching the spot is a bit of a workout. After the first stint of the season, I’m good to go. \nMy dog Scout is especially fond of this hike because it’s the only time she gets to charge around unleashed without me worrying about her tendency to run off. No matter where she is here, I can see her. So far, she has ignored the ground squirrels that burrow close to the trail. \nI’ve never been to this beautiful spot when there are any big crowds, and sometimes I get the viewpoint to myself. \nEven when company is present, tranquility reigns. No matter what else is going on in town or in the world even, you can sit for hours and contemplate the scenery or life in general. \nThe silence is broken only by the whispering breeze, the occasional hum of a plane or the panting of a happy, tired dog. \nThat’s the best kind of serenity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:20:15.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
