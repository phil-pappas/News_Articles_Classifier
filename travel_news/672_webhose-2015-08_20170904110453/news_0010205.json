In the second half, Navas made an excellent diving save on Rubén Castro’s penalty kick that made Santiago Bernabéu Stadium erupt in cheers.\nConstant rumors linking Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea to his hometown club still persist despite Navas’ dominant play thus far. ESPN reported Saturday that Manchester may offer De Gea 65 million euros in a trade for Bale at the last-minute before the transfer deadline ends on Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://www.espnfc.com/blog/transfer-talk/79/post/2585780/man-united-65m-david-de-gea-for-real-madrid-gareth-bale", "https://vine.co/v/eIe2Mi0qzxt/embed/simple", "https://vine.co/v/eIiaFxlIJrM/embed/simple"], "published": "2015-08-30T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:31:35.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
