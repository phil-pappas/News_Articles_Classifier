Published on : Friday, August 14, 2015\nAirChannelChoice.travel, a Business Travel Coalition (BTC) initiative, today transmitted a stern letter – with 10 pages of industry comments – to Lufthansa (LHG) Chairman and CEO Mr. Carsten Spohr rejecting his organization’s Distribution Cost Charge (DCC) – a 16 Euros surcharge for tickets purchased anywhere other than through LHG websites, service centers and airport ticket counters beginning on 1 September 2015. The letter, signed by a group of 135 diverse travel buyers, consumer groups, industry associations, travel agencies and other stakeholders, with operations in some 155 countries, was shared with the LHG Supervisory Board and antitrust officials in Brussels, Bonn and Washington. More than a third of the signatories expressed an unusual willingness to speak directly with the press on this issue.\nThe clear message to LHG and regulators is that front-line industry participants forcefully reject LHG’s attempt to abuse its dominant market position in seeking to increase revenue, decrease comparison-shopping and diminish intra and inter distribution channel competition. AirChannelChoice.travel is urging travel professionals in each country to formally request that their antitrust authorities weigh in on their behalf with DG COMP, the Bundeskartellamt and the U.S. Department of Justice.\nSignatories communicated that the surcharge would not just shift the cost of distributing LHG products to consumers and the managed-travel community, but would also create substantial new costs within the industry. As the cheerleading by LHG competitors at an IATA gathering in Miami, FL implies, airlines are poised to follow LHG. Consequently, the managed travel community may soon be forced to deal with hundreds of airlines’ one-off direct-connects undermining existing highly efficient corporate travel procurement processes by requiring new infrastructure and workaround procedures.\n“Today some airlines are waging a war on new entrant airline and inter and intra distribution channel competition. For example, in an unvarnished attempt at commercial protectionism, some U.S. and EU airlines have successfully strong-armed regulators to block Norwegian Air International’s proposal to serve U.S. markets from the EU and have called for a freeze on Gulf carrier service to both the U.S. and EU,” stated BTC and AirChannelChoice founder Kevin Mitchell. “Now that these carriers have secured their antitrust immunized global alliances, and dominant market positions, they are relentless in their pursuit to protect those positions through efforts to obscure fares and fees, undermine consumer protections and block competition. The LHG’s surcharge is just the latest egregious example of this anti-consumer behavior,” added Mitchell.\nSource:-BTC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:07:36.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
