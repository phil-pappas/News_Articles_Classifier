The show comes to life throughout the cruise with auditions, mentor rehearsal sessions, the iconic \"I Want You\" chairs, three charismatic team coaches and ultimately a live finale performance where guests choose the winner. \nThe Voice of the Ocean singing competition experience aboard Princess Cruises includes: \n• Karaoke try out sessions at the beginning of each cruise, for vocalists who are 16 years or older. There will be two opportunities to audition during open karaoke in one of the ships lounges or showrooms. Fellow guests and cruise staff will decide who moves on to compete. \n• Selected singers are assigned a mentor who will meet with them during the cruise to rehearse with the Princess Band and back-up singers to prepare for the best possible performance. The mentors will be a Princess musical entertainer or vocalist. \n• The Voice of the Ocean Live Show, hosted by the Cruise Director on the last night of the cruise will feature up to nine contestants performing in the Princess Theater for an audience that includes three high-profile team coaches that may include one of our guest entertainers, the Hotel General Manager or even the Captain. Just like the hit TV show, the trio of coaches will listen but not see the performer as they decide to turn their \"I Want You\" chair to choose the singer to be on their team. Once teams are chosen coaches will then each pick one finalist. From the three finalists, the audience votes for the winner who will be awarded a trophy and most importantly, the title The Voice of the Ocean. \n\"Whether guests are up on stage or in the audience deciding who gets their vote, we know The Voice of the Ocean will be a huge hit with Princess guests,\" said Adrian Fischer, vice president, entertainment for Princess Cruises. \"Guests will feel like they are part of the globally popular TV show performing on a high tech set almost identical to the hit show, including rotating red chairs and a live Princess band with back-up singers. We're excited to discover and foster undiscovered talent and offer guests a whole new way to express their love of music and performing.\" \nThe vocal competition will debut aboard Regal Princess in October, followed by Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess in November. Eight additional ships will offer The Voice of the Ocean rolling out between January and May of 2016. \nThis new partnership adds to the cruise line's \"come back new\" brand promise, designed to elevate the guest experience by creating enriching moments and lifelong memories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T05:06:01.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
