Two additional agreements on technical and financial cooperation covering a total commitment of US$18.9 million were also signed. An emphasis was put on supporting the Tanzanian health system. \nGermany will, in particular, assist Tanzania in developing a sustainable health financing regime, which provides better access to health services for the poor. \nIn addition, as part of a special program entitled “Health in Africa,” which intends to support the efforts of African partner countries to achieve sustainable improvements in their health systems, the Federal Republic of Germany will be making US$14.5 million in funding available next year. \nGermany will also continue its support to the water sector in Tanzania with the ultimate aim of providing access to clean and safe drinking water and sanitation for all by providing policy advice and investing in cost-efficient infrastructure with a particular emphasis on reaching the poor. \nFurthermore, Germany will assist Tanzania in tapping its renewable energy potential, including geothermal, in order to meet the G7 commitment to increase renewable energy supply in Africa. This is complemented by a program for strengthening capacities in resource governance. \nGerman ambassador to Tanzania, Egon Kochanke, said Germany has been committed to support Tanzania in various social and economic areas through a strong partnership existing over the past 50 years. The total German support to Tanzania under the signed agreement is US$210 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:45:45.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
