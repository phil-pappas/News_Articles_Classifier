They can’t help it, poor things. Besides, they usually don’t know any better: they spent their formative years sweating to get into the place they were told was the apex of ambition and achievement, then years more locked in a medieval cloister where it was drummed into them that to them and their gilded peers belongs the world and all that’s in it. And when I say locked in, I mean it. It was a stern porter with a fat bunch of keys who persuaded me to turn down a place at Oxford. I was staying in a college for entrance interviews, and wanted to go out that evening to meet the other person from my (bog-standard, northern, comprehensive) school in town for the same reason. “Door’s locked at 12,” he told me. What if I want to stay out later than that? (I didn’t, but that’s by the by.) The answer stays with me now, more than 20 years on: “Why would you want to do that? Everyone here is happy to be back by then.” That was that, really. When, some time later, said college kindly indicated it would open that studded door to me, I politely declined, and went to Edinburgh instead. That remains one of the best decisions I’ve made. No entry? Cambridge colleges such as Trinity, above, can still seem forbidding for students with a state education Photo: Alamy All this is to say I agree with Matthew Taylor. The chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts is now quietly regretting suggesting that kids with good A-levels should “stick two fingers up” to Oxbridge and similar institutions , but he had a point. There really can be more to life after A-levels than a “top” university. When A-level results arrive today, there will be 18-year-olds whose hearts practically burst with pride: they’ve made it, they’re going to Oxford or Cambridge. They are right to be proud. Their work and talent deserve all the accolades that life will now bestow on them. But there will also be those of equal talent and industry who don’t make it. What do our rigid ideas of Oxbridge and success mean for them? A university education is supposed to open the mind and expose us to new ideas. But our thinking about choosing a university rests on largely unquestioned consensus: Oxbridge best, Russell Group good, all else second-rate. Like all consensus, it deserves to be challenged. So too does the idea that everyone should go to university for three years after school. Happily, massive open online courses (or Moocs, as they are known) will change that assumption here as they are already doing elsewhere. Moocs allow anyone with an internet connection to study at any university enlightened enough to put its courses online. Harvard and Stanford lead the way; currently Britain’s “best” haughtily decline even to offer Moocs. Cambridge University students on graduation day. Photo: GEOFFREY ROBINSON/ALAMY With a similar lack of imagination, some big UK recruiters lazily hire almost exclusively from Oxbridge. Those pretty colleges are actually factories. They used to churn out churchmen, then civil servants. Now it’s fresh meat for the high-pay, long-hours professional services industries: banking, consultancy and law. That means a “top” university often yields a top salary. Statistics suggest new Oxbridge graduates earn 12 per cent more than contemporaries from other first-rank institutions. No statistics suggest they are 12 per cent more interesting, 12 per cent more creative, 12 per cent happier. Oxbridge: it’s what everyone wants to do.
