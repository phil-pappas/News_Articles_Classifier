Since announcing Vib (as in Vibrant), Best Western’s new urban boutique concept last October, the brand has eight Vib projects under development and is actively negotiating deals in key U.S. cities including Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, New Orleans, Scottsdale and San Diego.\n“Since the launch of Vib we have had tremendous interest from hotel developers and are especially pleased with the response from developers who have not previously developed Best Western hotels,” said Ron Pohl, senior vice president Brand Management. “Vib is really gaining traction because it is the only boutique concept designed for the upper midscale hotel segment and fills a niche that developers and customers want.”\nVib was designed for today’s connected traveler who is looking for social engagement, technology integration and consistent service. Vib’s vibrant lobby, stylish design and focus on convenience and technology integration will exceed their expectations. This unique concept has a minimal footprint, is cost effective to build, efficient to operate, and as a result of Best Westerns leading industry revenue contribution and fee structure, creates a highly profitable business model.\nIn addition to the previously announced Vib hotel projects in Chicago, Miami and Seoul, South Korea, the following Vîb hotels are expected to be open by the end of 2016:\n• The 200-room Los Angeles Vib\n• The 150-room Miami Vib. This is the second Vib under development in Miami.\n• The 81-room Staten Island Vib\n• The 112-room Little Rock Vib\n• The 90-room Springfield Vib", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:09:09.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
