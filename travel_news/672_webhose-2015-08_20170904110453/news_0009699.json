According to The Wall Street Journal , there are currently 115 venture capital-backed private companies valued at more than $1 billion, including ride sharing app operator Uber , which is valued at more than $50 billion , and travel booking platform Airbnb , worth over $25 billion . According to data from Preqin , a provider of data and intelligence on alternative assets, there have been a total of 1,066 venture capital-backed initial public offerings since 2007, valued at an aggregate $148.3 billion. In 2015 already, there have been 123 such IPOs totaling $9.5 billion. \nMany of these so-called \"unicorns\" have been in no rush to IPO, instead raising money via funding round after funding round. But given Monday's market correction and the uncertainty ahead, venture capital firms and the companies they've invested in may wish they'd expedited the process. \n\"I think the unicorns will be culled,\" said Kathleen Smith, Principal at IPO exchange-traded fund manager Renaissance Capital. \nMust Read: Alibaba Investors Need Not Panic--Chinese Consumer Spending Isn't Cooling Yet \nMarkets were rocked this week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 600 points on what some instantly dubbed \" Black Monday .\" In light of the rising concerns over China, low oil prices and weak global growth, investors have dampened share prices for former unicorns, like Alibaba ( BABA ) and Twitter ( TWTR - Get Report ) , which this week dipped below their IPO prices. \n\"This will have consequences for venture and private-equity valuations, and their ability to tap into the IPO market at any premium valuation,\" Smith said. \"They'll probably have to revalue their portfolios, even though they are illiquid, they have to be revalued because the public companies are all being revalued.\" \nSome companies will try to go public soon, many of which probably should have already done so already. Others will try to wait for the numbers to get better -- and not everyone will survive the lull. \n\"I cannot imagine any single venture investor that is not talking to their companies now about what happens if they can't get funding over the next year,\" said Smith. \"It's going to change the whole equation of that whole idea of 'we can wait to go public.'\" \nAs to what will happen in the weeks and months to come, time will tell. In the meantime, here is a look at the 10 biggest VC-backed IPOs to take place over the past eight years. \nAlibaba \nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba went public in September 2014. Its $25 billion offering was the largest global IPO ever. \nFounded in 1999 by Jack Ma, Alibaba received the backing of more than a dozen VC firms over the years, including China Development Bank Capital , DST Global , Mosaic Ventures , Temasek Holdings and Tiger Global Management . Tech company Yahoo! ( YHOO ) also invested in the company and sold off a portion of its stock in the IPO, bringing in $9.4 billion . \nIn a letter to potential investors prior to the IPO, Ma outlined his vision for the company. \n\"Alibaba is a values-based company driven by our mission 'to make it easy to do business anywhere,'\" he wrote. \"Our proposition is simple: we want to help small businesses grow by solving their problems through Internet technology.\" \nAlibaba was originally priced at $68, and the stock climbed as high as $120, before recently changing hands around $65. \nPreqin noted that Alibaba has actually celebrated two IPOs in its history, the first being the IPO of subsidiary Alibaba.com in Hong Kong in 2007. The firm raised HK$1.16 billion (approximately $1.5 billion) at the time. \nAlibaba Group reacquired Alibaba.com in 2012 before taking the entire entity public again in 2014. 1 of 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:07:31.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
