While Jeannine was painting, patrons of the lounge were able to keep an eye on her progress over signature cocktails and yummy snacks. \nApparently the artist doesn't suffer stage fright. Or perhaps she enjoys an audience. \nThe German artist also painted in her suite at the hotel as part of her worldwide “Suite View” art project, which is taking a look at some of the world's most spectacular skylines as viewed from the windows of hotel suites. \nThe project seems part of a global trend. As hotels seek ways to create a distinct identity, they seem increasingly to be turning to art and artists to set themselves apart from the pack. \nRound the World Tour \nArtist Jeannine Platz - Suite View Art Project. Copyright: Jeannine Platz . \n\nHong Kong is just one of several stops on a whirlwind world tour, which is taking the artist from hotels in Europe to Asia, ending up in the United States. \nThe artist has already painted scenes from hotel rooms and lobbies in Istanbul, Turkey; Oslo, Norway; Frankfurt, Germany; and Hamburg, Germany. \nAfter checking out of the InterContinental Hong Kong, the artist will fly to Shanghai, China. \nThen she will be off to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Singapore; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; and Los Angeles, California, finishing her world tour in New York, New York, which arguably has the world's most famous skyline. \nCan't wait to see what the artist comes up with when she comes face to face with the Big Apple! And I wonder which hotel she will be staying at? \nAfter Jeannine finishes her trip, she will present a large exhibition. An art book will also be published. \nHotels and Art Contemporary Chinese art on display in the lobby of the Langham Place Mongkok, Hong Kong, in Kowloon.
