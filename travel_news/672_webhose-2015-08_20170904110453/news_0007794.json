Its glossy pages harbored a treasure: maps of Disneyland and Disney World.\n\"I spent hours redrawing and redesigning the layouts of those parks because I loved the idea of creating a community,\" Chesky, 33, tells USA TODAY. \"To be doing that at age 10 does seem kind of crazy. But in some weird way, it's come full circle.\"\nWith a vengeance. What Chesky and his two former roommates and Airbnb co-founders Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk launched back in 2007 is fast revolutionizing the way the world views urban lodging. And now they're coming after new, lucrative market segments including Chinese tourists, the luxury vacation rental market and business travelers.\nWhere hotels once stood as singular and often pricey options for travelers, Airbnb's network of owner-offered rooms, apartments and houses now total 1.5 million listings in 191 countries in 34,000 cities. By collecting 3% of booking fees, Airbnb is reportedly hitting $1 billion in revenue this year, quadruple its 2013 take.\nAirbnb options range from spare bedrooms to large homes. On its biggest nights, 1 million people sleep in an Airbnb-affiliated property, and that rapid expansion has brought criticism that the tech start-up is negatively impacting urban housing demographics. But the company's growth seems relentless. A recent Merrill Lynch report predicts that by 2017, combined hotel and Airbnb room supply will outstrip demand and force a drop in hotel rates globally.\n\"Airbnb seems to have defied gravity,\" says Mike Olson, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. \"Their addressable market would seem to be any living quarters on earth.\"\nThe company's potential has generated $2.3 billion in funding and a valuation of $25 billion, putting Airbnb in the passenger seat of a sharing economy that is driven by $50 billion Uber.\nBut none of this is good enough for Chesky, a design school graduate who describes the company's mission as \"helping people belong everywhere, and not just in cities.\" He wants more.\nNext targets: China, business travel\nDespite China's recent economic woes, its middle class is growing. \"We are a global travel network, so if a Chinese person wants to travel the world, we are all over the world,\" Chesky says.\nAs for business travelers, \"we have signed up 700 companies (that include Airbnb as a lodging option), and we think it works because business travel can be very lonely.\" Meanwhile, diving deeper into home rentals— a stark contrast from its urban, room and apartment roots — likely will be the biggest hurdle, given the dominant presence of VRBO.com and HomeAway.\n\"Each one of those categories is a $100 billion or more market, so if you add them up it's bigger than the business we're in today,\" says Chesky. In fact, the pie is huge. Travel and tourism is a $1.5 trillion business globally, with lodging accounting for nearly $760 billion of that, according to IBIS World.\nChesky simultaneously displays a boyish charm (his eyes light up if you mention his beloved sport of hockey) and a tycoon's drive (he is willing to be \"annoying\" with mentors such as Apple design chief Jony Ive and PayPal Chairman John Donahoe to glean insight).\n\"It's like our hockey coach told us, you want to skate to where the puck is going to be, and I want to position us for where the company is going to be,\" he says.\nFirst, Airbnb has to contend with criticism from activists and municipalities for negatively impacting neighborhoods by encouraging owners of multiple properties to turn their domiciles into revolving cash machines instead of longterm residential units.\nLast fall, New York's attorney general Eric Schneiderman vowed to crack down on Airbnb, contending that 72% of the company's listings violated zoning regulations that require anyone renting a property for less than 30 days to be on the premises.\n\"At the moment, economic incentive is winning out,\" says Murray Cox, whose Inside Airbnb website profiles the company's offerings. \"You end up seeing hundreds of apartments that are therefore not on the long-term rental market. In aggregate, I don't think Airbnb is a force for good.\"\nChesky counters: \"I don't think we're ruining any city. We started this company to help pay the rent on our San Francisco apartment, and we feel that in many cases we help people stay in their homes by giving them supplemental income.\"\nThe battle is far from over. City officials and concerned citizens from coast to coast continue to challenge Airbnb. For his part, Chesky acknowledges that the open nature of the platform \"inevitably brings some bad actors.\"\nThe key challenge ahead for Airbnb will be to keep momentum without risking hits to the company's feel-good image. But if Uber is any guideline, its myriad PR black eyes — from its CEO's sexist comments to misogynist ads — seem to be glossed over by consumers eager for convenience and low prices.\nBenioff has been mentoring Chesky\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff has served as a mentor to Chesky, focusing in particular on \"helping Brian balance between the present and the future, to make sure he's not just a great visionary, but also a great operator.\"\nBenioff cites the example of \"young Steve Jobs versus old Steve Jobs,\" with the latter combining the power of vision with the mastery of execution.\n\"A big part of Brian's story is his age. He's one of the young guns who include guys like (29-year-old Box CEO) Aaron Levie,\" says Benioff, who credits Airbnb listings with helping him pull off his annual Dreamforce conference. \"He's anxious, and he wants to create the future as he sees it.\"\n© Provided by USA Today For sharing-economy expert Arun Sundararajan, part of Chesky's magic is rooted in his Rhode Island School of Design roots. In fact, the CEO's idea of fun is sketching for hours on end.\n\"It's almost like he's designing what a great company should look and operate like, as opposed to just gunning for profits at all costs,\" says Sundararajan, who teaches business at New York University. \"His philosophy seems to be guided by how to build another Facebook or Google.\"\nChesky says work is all consuming these days. Vacations largely consist of occasional getaways in the Bay Area with his girlfriend, using Airbnb-rented outposts to explore new parts of the region.\nAt work, much of his day is focused on growing the swelling company's internal culture as well as high-profile new hires such as CFO Laurence Tosi, a finance world defector (ex-Blackstone Group) lured to the tech start-up.\nHe also says that he's eager to echo Benioff's personal and corporate philanthropical largesse, \"and you'll see a number of things from me and Airbnb in this area soon.\"\nFor Chesky, what Airbnb is achieving is, in fact, but a small part of what he sees as an inevitable remaking of the U.S. business landscape.\n\"This is a revolution created by everyone being connected to everyone else,\" he says. \"We in the sharing economy represent what happens when the Internet moves into your neighborhood. I believe we're just in Chapter 2 of a really long book about this age. There's huge growth ahead of us.\"\nUSA TODAY's Change Agents series highlights innovators and entrepreneurs looking to change business and culture with their vision.
