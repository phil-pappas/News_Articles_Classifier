BENDER The Associated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO — Public urination has gotten so bad in San Francisco that the city has painted nine walls with a repellant paint that makes pee spray back on the offender. \nIt’s the latest effort to address a chronic problem in a city where the head of public works calls himself Mr. Clean: Walls are coated with a clear, liquid repellant material that goes on much like paint. Any urine that hits it splashes back on a person’s shoes and pants \nMohammed Nuru, director of San Francisco’s public works department, says offenders will need to make the mistake only once to get the idea. \n“If you have to go,” he said, “go in the right place.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:53:56.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
