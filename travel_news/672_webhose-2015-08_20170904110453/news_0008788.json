The French network of Air France-KLM is negotiating the last remaining points of the scheme in parallel with talks on a new successor plan, labelled Perform 2020.\nHuman Resources Director Xavier Broseta announced the move in a letter to the union's president, accusing him of failing to turn up to sign an agreement on certain parts of the accord.\nThe letter said the airline was not prepared to wait for further consultations proposed by the union.\n\"We are very surprised because there has never been any formal agreement that needed to be signed,\" the union spokesman said, adding this marked a step back from greater co-operation established since early July.\nA spokeswoman for Air France declined to comment.\nThe points still being discussed involve night-time working, crew composition and the overall direction of pay.\nThe SNPL has pushed back the deadline for consultations with its members to August 18 from August 7.\nIt was central to a bitter 15-day pilots' strike last year, but a spokesman said a new walkout was not on the agenda.\nHowever, relations between Air France and the union, which had eased in recent weeks, appear to have taken a new downturn.\nAir France took the union to court in mid-June to try to force through reforms, but was rebuffed by a French court.\nAir France has sealed two key agreements in recent weeks: to keep open three regional bases - Nice, Marseille and Toulouse - and to help about 100 Boeing 747 pilots transfer to new posts when the elderly aircraft are retired by 2016.\nLast month, Air France-KLM chief executive Alexandre de Juniac urged Air France pilots to reach a new productivity agreement by the end of September or face \"severe measures\" to cut routes in the airline's long-haul network.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T05:34:56.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
