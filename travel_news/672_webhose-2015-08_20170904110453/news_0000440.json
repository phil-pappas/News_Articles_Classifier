But apps can help make strategic planning easier and less time consuming. Here’s our pick of the best. Know your financial strength An uncosted plan might be better described as a pipe dream. While SME leaders need to see the bigger picture, their strategic planning also needs to be grounded in reality, and financial certainty most of all. Float is a potent accounting tool that allows small businesses to create powerful cashflow analytics, giving predictions for future finances that can be measured against plans for business development. If your strategic planning includes expansion, branching into new sectors or a new product launch, Float will help make it financially viable. Unleash your creativity Mind mapping is a creative way to link concepts, allowing ideas to grow, expand and become bona fide strategies. Mind mapping apps such as iMindMapHD make ideas widely available and easy for everyone in the team to find and collaborate on. “It enables both creative and logical thinking to happen concurrently,” says Susanna Simpson, managing director of PR company Limelight, who uses iMindMapHD. “When you’re generating ideas and project plans you need something practical and useable that you can share with people, rather than reams of lists and notes. On one page we have been able to produce an entire business plan for the next three years of Limelight,” she adds. Go deeper with CRM Your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is an essential part of your day-to-day business, but dig deeper and it can also provide the sort of insight that informs successful strategic planning. Zoho CRM Plus , for example, creates a single hub for all customer-related information, from their status and standing to the level of their engagement with your website, allowing SMEs to base future plans on real customer data rather than educated guesswork. “Zoho CRM Plus not only covers every single interaction along the customer lifecycle, but brings context to each of them, making it the only complete customer software designed for this new [digital] era,” says Rodrigo Vaca, vice president of marketing for Zoho. The wisdom of crowds If you inwardly groan when words like “crowdsourcing” are bandied about, be assured that with a new generation of collaborative management tools the “crowd” can be as large or small as you want it to be. The key is in their ability to take ideas and develop them while allowing relevant interested voices to chip in. With Sideways 6 , for example, businesses set challenges – whether that’s solving a current workflow problem or exploring potential new revenue streams – which their employees respond to with innovative ideas. Wazoku is another popular ideas management app that allows employees and stakeholders outside a business to help mould good ideas into winning strategies. Manage time better Strategic planning might focus on growth and innovation but also on efficiency. What do staff spend too much or too little time on, and can the relevant processes be streamlined or outsourced? Where do bottlenecks occur and how can they be avoided? When SMEs are growing from micro businesses to larger operations, good time management can be crucial to future success, and a number of apps have appeared to help SMEs become more time efficient. One is Harvest , which helps with day-to-day time management and also presents SME leaders with data to help them make better long-term strategic decisions on staffing, growth and resourcing. “Time-tracking and resourcing is the bane of any service business,” says Anant Sharma, chief executive officer of creative agency Matter of Form. “Ultimately, staff use simple tools that aren’t a headache to update – the organisation of the data is up to management. On that basis, rather than an overblown all-in-one suite, we use Harvest.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Top tips for setting up a YouTube business channel • How SMEs can make the most of sports sponsorship • Top seedfunding tips for SMEs • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:12:49.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
