A couple weeks ago, a friend and I traveled up the beautiful highway to San Luis Obispo and decided to take the road even further, up to Big Sur. The drive from Rancho Cucamonga to San Luis Obispo on a Friday afternoon took just over four hours, not too bad for 250 miles. After spending the night in SLO, we headed about 20 minutes up the 1 to iconic Morro Bay. The bay is known for the massive rock that juts out from the sandy shore, now designated as a sanctuary for Peregrine falcons. The beach is beautiful, but the wind and cold water make it difficult to swim or sunbathe at the beach. The best bet is to walk along the paved bike path to the south side of the rock and rent paddleboards or kayaks to get to the small island across the way. The wind is calmer there and sea otters swim near you. After camping near the beach, we got into the car for what we thought would be a relatively quick two-hour drive up to Big Sur. As beautiful as the views are, the winding highway made it difficult to get anywhere quick, and the drive was closer to three-and-a-half hours with a constant fear that we passed the destination because we had no GPS service. Nevertheless, the drive was worth it and we made it to the campground nestled in the woods before walking down to Pfeiffer-Big Sur State Beach and seeing whales breaching on the horizon. The area is a relatively short drive away for a complete change-of-scenery, and campgrounds are a cheap alternative to expensive, waterfront hotels.
