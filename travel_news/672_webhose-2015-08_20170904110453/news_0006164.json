Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand are announcing $8.9 million in new federal funding for runway and airfield upgrades at John F. Kennedy Inernational Airport. The senators believe the funding will reduce the time planes spend on the ground while also improving safety. The announcement on Friday was cheered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio. Cuomo said the upgrades will help the region improve \"its ability to meet the demands of modern air travel.\" News of the additional funding comes just weeks after Cuomo and Vice President Joseph Biden announced a $4 billion plan to overhaul the city's other airport, LaGuardia Airport. Both New York City airports, as well as nearby Newark Liberty International Airport, annually rank among being the worst for travel delays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T18:28:23.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
