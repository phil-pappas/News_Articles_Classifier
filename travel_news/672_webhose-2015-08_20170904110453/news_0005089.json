A recent Guest review summed it up as follows: “Having stayed in many hotels all over the world, from budget to mid-scale and luxury, I was very pleasantly surprised with my room at the Holiday Inn Vilnius, the hotel which I definitely consider a design award winner!”\nRefurbished guest rooms now form a perfect match with the bright, practical and high-tech in design Conference Centre which has 6 stylish and well-equipped meeting rooms that bring business in comfort.\nTo round off the attractive package of hotel service, a full buffet breakfast is taken in the hotel’s restaurant RIB ROOM. Besides classical international cuisine, a variety of rib dishes are served in surprisingly different ways. There are always a selection of more than 100 whiskies in the Lobby Bar. Bartenders have been well trained and are ideally placed to help guests to select the whisky they may be looking for. Complimentary internet access with a strong connection in guest rooms, meeting rooms and public areas make hotel guests very satisfied.\nThe four-star hotel Holiday Inn Vilnius is a part of International Hotel Group, a worldwide leading hotel chain. The hotel is located in the rapidly expanding Vilnius business district while at the same time it is in the vicinity of the Old Town and just 8 km from Vilnius International Airport.\nSource: CONVENE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T18:11:50.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
