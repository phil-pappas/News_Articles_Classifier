Morocco and Malaysia come in 4th and 5th. \nVietnam continues to be a perennial family favourite, as a gentle – and affordable – introduction to adventure travel. \nThere's been a 43 per cent increase in bookings for family tours with Intrepid Travel this year. Ad Feedback \nOn an Intrepid trip to Vietnam last year, we tore through the streets of Hanoi in cyclos, slept on a boat in Halong Bay, and explored the Cu Chi tunnels near Ho Chi Minh City. \nA group family tour is the perfect way to explore Vietnam, as the adults form a 'human shield' around the kids to cross the chaotic roads. \n\"It's important to expand kids' horizons beyond their home and school, or a hotel with homogenised restaurants and limited interaction with the local culture,\" Paddy says. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T06:48:33.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
