Today, in celebration of National Relaxation Day on Saturday, August 15, VisitMyrtleBeach.com encourages travelers to get away and use their PTO as part of a multifaceted marketing campaign that highlights the beautiful weather and calming fall season in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\nDubbed “Relax and Unwind: 60 More Days of Summer,” the campaign pays homage to the first 60 days of the fall and the area’s 60 miles of coastline. A list of 60 ways to relax on a Myrtle Beach vacation will encourage travelers to consider the destination for a visit this fall. With ideas for every kind of traveler – from girlfriend getaways to family vacations, cultural enthusiasts to romantics – there are plenty of ways to relax in Myrtle Beach.\n“September and October are often referred to as the ‘perfect time of year’ by locals, and it’s no surprise to us,” said Scott Schult, executive vice president of marketing for the Myrtle Beach Area CVB. “The weather is still beautiful, ocean waters are warm, crowds subside and accommodations become even more affordable. It’s like being handed 60 more days of summertime, except that it’s even more relaxing and quiet during the fall season.”\nThe destination hopes to further help its visitors truly relax on vacation by removing distractions. According to the American Psychological Association, 44 percent of adults check email while on vacation and one in 10 check-in as often as hourly. The U.S. Travel Association says a fear of being able to “truly disconnect” on vacation is a top reason workers don’t use PTO. To help travelers disconnect from the office, select Myrtle Beach restaurants will offer various incentives – like free dessert or a glass of wine – during September and October for diners willing to valet their smartphone at the door during their meal. Further, the 60 relax and unwind ideas feature many attractions and amusements where a smartphone is not allowed or discouraged, like during a secluded kayak tour on the Waccamaw River or parasailing on the ocean.\nAnother hindrance for workers, according to the U.S. Travel Association survey, is their budget. Visit Myrtle Beach aims to overcome this issue by offering myriad attraction and accommodation deals throughout September and October, all with a 60-themed twist. Deals include everything from 60 percent off hotel rates to a pair of premium live entertainment tickets for $60.\nSource: Myrtle Beach", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:09:25.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
