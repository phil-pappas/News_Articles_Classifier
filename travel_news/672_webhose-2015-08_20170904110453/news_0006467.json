He did not give further details on what the air force is expected to do. \nIn related news, the Transport Ministry is expected to wrap up drafting a new aviation policy called \"Open Sky with Conditions\" and seek cabinet approval for the draft by the end of next month. \nWhen the new aviation policy is implemented, a new system of managing air traffic will be adopted to re-regulate flight schedules so airports can accommodate the growing number of flights landing and taking off, said Woradech Hanprasert, deputy transport permanent secretary. \nThailand will keep its open sky policy but direct and regular commercial flights will get priority over irregular chartered flights. \nThis is so the number of flights does not overload Thai skies, he said. \n\"Currently, flight schedules are limited and we are managing to respond to every request to land and take off at airports. Each year, about 700,000 flights land in Thailand. The number is expected to rise to 1 million next year,\" Mr Woradech said. \nTo handle this, open sky policy implementation will be divided into three phases, he said. \nIn the short-term plan from this year until next year, the Airports of Thailand (AoT) and the Aeronautical Radio of Thailand will work on re-arranging flight schedules, he said. \nThe Transport Ministry also will work with the air force on the ministry's plan to ask for permission to use more military air space for commercial purposes, he said. \nIn the middle-term plan between 2017 and 2019, the AoT will consider increasing the number of aprons, runways and air bridges at its airports, he said. \nAs for the long term plan from 2020 until 2024, the AoT will develop and expand its main airports such as Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueang and Phuket, he said. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
