The incident took place in the high speed Thalys service near Arras. The attacker was arrested at the Arras station after being overpowered by brave American passengers.\nOut of three people who were injured two of them seriously – one with a gunshot wound, the other a knife wound.\nThe man arrested was a 26-year-old Moroccan. Anti-terrorist officers have taken over the case. The weapons were said to include a Kalashnikov, a knife, an automatic pistol and cartridges.\nSome passengers, which included US service members managed to subdue the attacker. Their courage was praised by the US President Barack Obama.\nThe passengers showed courage under the difficult conditions they were subjected to and with the right composure and tact they manage to overpower the gunman.\nThe US mariners among the passengers had heard the man loading a weapon in a toilet cubicle and confronted him when he came out. News of the attack was shared on social media.\nThe passengers included French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade who was lightly wounded breaking glass to sound the alarm, and Chris Norman, a British man living in France. The other men were awarded medals of bravery at a restaurant in Arras.\nFrance’s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve praised the action of American passengers who prevented a ghastly attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:05:39.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
