That is, last century.\nHowever, this has been a topic of national debate for at least 15 years. That is why more than 10 years ago — in 2004 — Liberal Prime Minister John Howard changed the Marriage Act to stipulate it was for a man and a woman only.\nGoing it alone ... Tony Abbott has dug in. Source: News Corp Australia\n“Prior to that, it wouldn’t have occurred to anyone in our culture and civilisation that marriage was not between a man and a woman,” Mr Abbott told ABC radio.\n“I can remember my own university debates with gay friends and the idea that the gay community would have in those days waited to embrace a bourgeois institution like marriage would have been unthinkable.\n“Things change.”\nMr Abbott might have harnessed the forces of fogeydom to his advantage within the Government, he has broken new ground with the promise of a “people’s vote” to settle the matter some time following the next election.\nAfter the recent Irish vote backed marriage equality, Mr Abbott sternly said that process wasn’t for Australia. It would be settled here by the Parliament. Last night, he revealed had changed his mind, but didn’t explain exactly to what.\nThings change.\nBut does he mean a referendum to change the Constitution, as Treasurer Joe Hockey this morning suggested?\nSection 51 says the “ ... Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to ...” It lists some 40 matters from lighthouses to telegraph operations.\nNumber 21 is marriage. It is not clear what a change to the Constitution’s Section 51:21 would achieve, why it would be necessary.\nBut it appears the Prime Minister is looking for something more binding than a giant opinion poll, and the inspiration for the preferred format could be Liberal Cory Bernardi, a firm opponent to same-sex marriage.\n“Quite frankly, if there was a majority of people in a majority of states saying that’s what we want … who am I to argue with that, quite frankly?” Senator Bernardi told the National Press Club on July 29.\nHe was imposing the tough conditions for a successful referendum on what would be a plebiscite.\nLyle Shelton, of the Australian Christian Lobby, today also saw a vote as a referendum disguised as a plebiscite, insisting “it was important there was equal public funding for both sides and Parliament should impose a ban on overseas donations to either side”.\nThat battle is well down the track, and first will be the election. Mr Abbott’s leader’s call — contrary to the positions of half his ministry — will be cheered by his usual supporters but younger voters might be placing it next to policies on climate change and gender politics to re-evaluate the Prime Minister.\nOriginally published as Tony Abbott’s biggest problem now", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/tony-abbott-has-a-lot-of-work-to-do-to-convince-the-electorate-hes-not-a-man-stuck-in-the-past/story-fnet09y4-1227480107788", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/12/1227480/107971-a4becb4c-408a-11e5-91d1-7a17ec48b9e9.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/liberal-mp-warren-entsch-to-lead-way-with-cross-party-bill-on-same-sex-marriage/story-fnet09y4-1227479892860"], "published": "2015-08-12T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T05:00:26.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
