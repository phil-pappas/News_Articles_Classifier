That detective, Keith Broughton, also said that witnesses described the incident as a one-on-one fight, not a beating by a white mob, as King claimed.\nIn his blog post, King, who maintained that he underwent spinal surgeries after the altercation, pointed to other witnesses who remember it differently.\nOn social media, the question over King’s race has drawn multiple comparisons to Dolezal, who resigned her position with the Spokane chapter of the NAACP after her parents said she was white. The Dolezal case set off a national debate over racial identity and white privilege.\nLike Dolezal, King attended a historically black college. He matriculated at Morehouse College, a college in Atlanta for men, with the help of a scholarship sponsored by Oprah Winfrey.\nResponding to a report asking whether he misled Winfrey, King said he “did not concoct a lie” about his race to gain admission to Morehouse or to get the scholarship.\nMorehouse officials said on Twitter that the college did not grant admissions or scholarships based on race.\nKing has founded several startups promoting philanthropy through technology, according to his website 100 Life Goals. He is a justice columnist for the Daily Kos website and has written for publications including The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and Vox.\nKing has said he comes from a blended family and that none of his siblings have the same sets of parents.\nHe has many online detractors, consisting of conservative bloggers and black activists.\nBut, unlike Dolezal, King also has a large online following, which has risen up to defend him.\nDerrick Clifton, a writer for The Daily Dot, says the difference between King and Dolezal (who continues to identify as black) is biology.\n“The disgraced NAACP leader also took deliberate steps to conceal her true physical appearance, altering it with traditionally black hairstyles and spray tans,” Clifton wrote. “That’s different from being biracial and referring to oneself as either black or biracial: Racial identity is not a game of pick-and-choose.”\nKATIE ROGERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:34:44.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
