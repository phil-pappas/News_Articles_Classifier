No internet, no TV and not even simple cell phone connectivity, which we have gotten used to these days. Located about 4 kilometres from Sringeri on the Sringeri-Chickmagalur road lies 36 acres of green gardens and plantations surrounded by the dense green mountains of the Western Ghats. This place, run by a local family offers total solitude in true Malnad style and amidst beautiful nature. The accommodation is simple. It comes with twin beds and an attached bathroom in each room. There is hot water facility available, but you can find no more materialistic luxuries. Instead, you will enjoy other luxuries that have long been forgotten in our fast paced lives, like their organic home grown food, their home cows, lush green surroundings, total solitude and living a life without any material distractions. The wife of the homestay owner cooks some top quality lip smacking Malnad Food. Just thinking about her home cooked organic banana halwa, home made pickles, jack fruit papad, her curries and even her coffee makes my mouth water. In their gardens, you can spot beautiful birds and butterflies and sometimes like I did, a green vine snake, a non venomous and extremely pretty reptile. Their homestay consists of 36 acres of beautiful plantations that can be explored and also the rustic countryside around it. Sringeri town and the Sharadamba temple and Sringeru Mutt are just 4 kilometers away. Sirimane falls is about 22 kilometers away and the rainforest of Agumbe is about 30 kms away. Next to their property are beautifully green paddy fields and a mountain stream that one can explore as a leisurely walk from the homestay. There are no villages close by. Instead, there are houses that are self sufficient and spread across this area. Chickmagalur is also just about 90 kms away. Basically, what I am trying to say is that if you are itchy to do something aside from relaxing, you have quite a few interesting options at hand. If you want total solitude during your weekend or long holiday, I would recommend this place. If you want to taste some delicious organic food, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a relaxing place to stay while exploring Sringeri and Agumbe, I would recommend this place. I like this place so much that I would definitely return here. I have also recommended it to all my friends and family. If you wish to find more details about this place, the cost of their rooms and their contact details for making bookings, look up the Keremane Homestay website . Do note that this place only accepts to host families. They don’t accept bachelors or people who wish to eat meat or drink in their premises. If you love to try out their vegetarian food during your stay and stay away from your alcohol during your stay, you should not have any problems.
