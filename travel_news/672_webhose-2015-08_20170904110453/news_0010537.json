The chairman of the General Medicine Council (GMC) said medicine needs to learn from the army, in the way that soldiers are coached in coping strategies before they come under pressure. Professor Terence Stephenson said doctors needed to learn to develop “emotional armour” to protect them from growing levels of \"burnout\". He told The Telegraph: “Doctors see things that many other people will never see in a lifetime. Just as when soldiers go to Afghanistan, you don’t want the first time they see at somebody who has suffered terrible injuries to be when they’re dealing with an emergency in the heat of the moment. “We need to try and prepare them for that in advance,” he said. “Army personnel have told me that they would not begin resilience training just as they’re about to deploy and I fully understand that. The army discovered some time ago that soldiers under pressure aren’t helped if they are just told to keep a stiff upper lip. It’s time medicine reached a similar conclusion – and acted on it.'' Training for future medics will require them to show they have developed psychological coping techniques, as well as clinical knowledge and professional skills, under the new GMC proposals. The paediatrician said doctors were under growing pressure from an increasing workload, and the demands of a “less deferential” society. An analysis by the Royal College of GPs found that 47 million GP appointments in 2013 – one in six of all consultations – involved a wait of at least seven days to see a doctor or nurse Photo: ALAMY He said doctors needed to be prepared to cope with the emotional strain of devastating situations, and face the likelihood that some decisions would face complaint or investigation during their career. “During one day last week seeing emergencies, I cared for a child of seven with an incurable life-limiting condition who will not survive until 17, and a 17-year old who took a life-threatening paracetamol overdose because she cannot face the next day,” he said. “Despite 32 years as a doctor, seeing patients suffering is still very stressful for me so how much more difficult must it be for a recently qualified doctor?” ''Without developing a psychological 'carapace' or some 'emotional armour' which allows one at the end of the day to hand over care of patients to the night team, to go home and not agonise over these worrying patients, doctors can burn out,” he said. Earlier this year, the senior doctor, who has twice faced a GMC investigation, said medics needed help to cope with the pressures of such complaints. In December an internal review by the GMC identified 28 cases between 2005 and 2013 in which doctors committed suicide while under investigation by the regulator. The report called for the introduction of “emotional resilience” training for trainee doctors, and more support for those alleged to have failed in their duties. The new proposals, which have gone out to public consultation, until September, set out the core knowledge, skills and behaviours that the GMC expects doctors to demonstrate including “effective communication, team-working and patient-centred decision making.” Afghan soldiers perform during their training by the US Army in Herat city, one of the seven Afghan cities and provinces where US is to handover security responsibility to Afghan forces Photo: EPA Under the plans, medical schools will have to ensure that emotional resilience training is a “regular and integral part of the medical school curriculum”. Trainee doctors will have to demonstrate that they have such skills by the end of their postgraduate speciality training. Prof Stephenson said doctors did not need to learn to be less empathetic or caring, but to find ways to cope with the demands on them. “Emotional resilience is the ability to adapt to stressful situations. What it means is that you need some protective mechanisms and coping strategies,” he said. ''The Army invests significantly in emotional resilience training. We want doctors to feel as prepared to deal with whatever comes their way as soldiers do and this is one way that this can be achieved.'' Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association council said: “Developing emotional resilience in the medical workforce is important, but it should be a joint responsibility that the NHS plays a key role in delivering. Employers need to put in place an environment that supports doctors and establishes a culture where hospitals and GP practices have the resources to ensure high quality patient care.\" He said many services were struggling badly to cope with patient demand and staff shortages. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: “GPs are working harder than ever to meet increasing patient demand with limited resources and this unrelenting workload pressure undoubtedly puts our physical and mental health at risk.\" She said support to develop \"coping strategies\" was welcome but called for practical measures, such as mandatory breaks and a full scale review of general practice, in order to reduce the strain on GPs. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:37:52.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
