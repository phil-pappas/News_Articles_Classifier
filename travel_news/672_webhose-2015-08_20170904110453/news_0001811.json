Guest room at the Langham Place Mongkok, Hong Kong.Photo Credit: Langham Hotels. \n\nLangham Place, Mongkok, has launched complimentary and unlimited local and IDD phone calls during a hotel guest's stay. It also provides 3G data connectivity and Wi-Fi teathering throughout Hong Kong. \nNext to being charged outrageous prices for snacking from the mini bar and logging unto the Internet, paying ridiculously high prices to make local phone calls is one of the top pet peeves of many hotel guests. \nAnd now, not only are local phone calls free - the same goes for international phone calls, as well, to the following countries: Australia, Britain, China, Singapore, and the United States. \nNot only that, you don't have to be in your hotel room to make it happen! Here's How It Works \nHotel guests are issued a Handy Smartphone when they check in at the Langham Place Mongkok, Hong Kong. \nThe device comes pre-loaded with several applications such as social media platforms, news services, a video and camera function, a currency converter, MTR train location maps, and tips on what to see, where to shop, and where to eat. \nThere are interactive maps and a Hong Kong city guide as well as information on events, restaurant recommendations, discounts - the list goes on. \n\"With the new handy phones in all our guest rooms, we are able to enhance our guest experience, in order for them to stay connected and access essential information anytime whilst they breeze around the city,’ says Shaun Campbell, General Manager of Langham Place, Mongkok, Hong Kong. \n“Guests can take photos and videos on the handy, easily transfer them to their own devices before they leave, and all data will be cleared the moment a guest checks out, with a new number and fresh start for every new guest that checks in. It’s the way forward.” \nFirst Mover Advantage The Mira has offered Handy Smartphones to hotel guests since August 2013.

It was the first hotel in the region to do so. \nThe Mira's device offers free IDD calls to 25 countiries (both landlines and mobile), free local calls, and Wi-Fi tethering throughout Hong Kong. It also comes pre-loaded with several apps such as an in-room dining menu and a concierge connection. \n\"Plenty of hotels in Hong Kong and Singapore have this feature now, but we were the FIRST to launch such service in Asia-Pacific,\" a spokesman for the hotel says. \n\"Different hotels will have different functionalities included in the package, i.e. no Wi-Fi tethering at the W Hong Kong, or only 10 countries of IDD calls at the Luxe Manor, etc.\" \nWhere \nLangham Place Mongkok, Hong Kong, 555 Shanghai Street, Mongkok, Kowloon, Hong Kong.
