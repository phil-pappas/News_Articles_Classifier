The findings of this report simply do not add up,” said Gatwick boss Stewart Wingate.\n“Britain is in danger of losing out once again if we repeat mistakes of the past – Heathrow has failed time and again and the Airports Commission report and the conditions placed on expansion have not solved the huge obstacles confronting it.”\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: “The Airports Commission undertook a £20m, two-and-a-half year, detailed study of where the next runway should be in the UK. It unanimously and unambiguously chose Heathrow because it is the only option that will connect the whole UK to global growth.”\nA spokesman for the commission said: “The evidence in the final report was subject to extensive analysis and consultation and we are confident that it is fit for purpose.”\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-18T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:35:30.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
