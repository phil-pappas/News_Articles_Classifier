Instead, the retailer will carry more shotguns and other hunting weapons. Lundberg said the decision was based on shifting demand from shoppers. “It’s about what customers are buying and what they’re not,” he said.\nWal-Mart’s decision to phase out modern sporting rifles—a category that includes firearms based on the AR-15 platform, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation— was months in the making, Lundberg said. The changes are being rolled out to stores this week as Wal-Mart updates its sporting goods sections for the fall season. The guns Wal-Mart are removing are sold in less than a third of its 4,500 U.S. stores.\nThe retailer has long held that it will carry products, including firearms, to serve hunters and sportsmen, but it doesn’t sell items such as adult films, or music with explicit-lyric warning labels or, outside of Alaska, handguns. Earlier this year, it vowed to remove merchandise from its stores that depicted the Confederate battle flag.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-to-stop-selling-semiautomatic-rifles-citing-declining-demand-1440616954/?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:14:53.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
