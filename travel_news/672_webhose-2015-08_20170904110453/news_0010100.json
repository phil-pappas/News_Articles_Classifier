Located in the Alps, near the French and Swiss borders, the village is situated in the beautiful region of the Giffre Valley. Considered one of the most beautiful towns in France, Samoens has been bestowed the honour of the status of 'ville fleurie'. \nFor adventure skiing holidays in France that truly offer something for everyone, Samoens is ideal. Not only does it offer exceptional skiing and snowboarding, this very family friendly resort provides loads of other exciting winter sports opportunities, along with plenty to do off-skis as well. \nSuperb Skiing \nSamoens is one of the five towns that make up the Grand Massif ski area. Although you can’t ski directly back into this lovely village, it's really no disadvantage in this case as the surrounding region is so beautiful. If you're bringing younger members of the family on your skiing holidays in France (or beginner skiers) there are schools for both boarding and skiing and a range of beginner slopes that are a great to practice on. There's a long blue run, which takes in intermediate slope of around 14 kilometres, and for those who are up for something with a bit more bite, there are plenty of red and black slopes. You can also take advantage of the array of off-piste routes, along with some fantastic opportunities to try out the thrilling sport of ski touring (including the chance to go abseiling) – a very different way to enjoy adventure skiing holidays in France. \nHave Fun Off Your Skis Too! \nNot only does staying in Samoens put you right in the heart of some exceptional winter sports opportunities, it also has a rich history and plenty of things to do and see when you are not skiing, boarding, ski touring or off-pisting! It is the only winter sports resort to be given the classification of 'monument historique', and the legacy of the craftsmanship of the traditional stonemasons the area is known for is evident everywhere in the architecture. It's lovely to spend an afternoon simply wandering around the village appreciating the architecture, landscape and culture. \nIf you just can't keep away from some of the more energetic pursuits, you could try some sledging, ice skating or, for the more adventurous types, ice climbing. There are several places in the village offering lessons to get you started, and special guided trails and paths where you'll be able to get the most out of the sport.
