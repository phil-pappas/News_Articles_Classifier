Now according to British SKYNEWS and at another beach location on Reunion Island a door of a plane has been found washed up. \nThis door was flown to Paris and driven to a military base near Toulouse and is currently undergoing tests to find out if it is from MH370. \nIf confirmed, the discovery could offers hope of an explanation to the families and loved ones of the 239 missing passengers and crew. \nAviation experts say the component may have stayed afloat due to air pockets in its structure and is almost certainly part of a Boeing 777. \nExperts will attempt to verify the serial number of the wing-flap before conducting further tests to establish why it separated from the rest of the plane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:39:24.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
