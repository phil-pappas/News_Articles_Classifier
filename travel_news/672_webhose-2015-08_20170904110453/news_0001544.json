Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 09, 2015 Hamad International Airport   \nA year down the line the Hamad International Airport, built as new home hub for Qatar Airways, has clocked over 28 million passengers since operations shifted to the new facility. \nThis figure represents an increase in traffic of nearly 25 percent, a massive rise in numbers to a great part attributed to the appeal by Qatar Airways as a global 5 star airline, an increase in their fleet and a growth of their network across the continents. \nAircraft movements of the 36 airlines flying scheduled serviced to Doha have exceeded 193.000 during the airport’s first year of operations, again more than 11 percent over the previous year before moving to the new mega airport. \nWithin a year of commencing operations, HIA has won six Skytrax 2015 awards at the Skytrax Airport Award Ceremony, held at the Passenger Terminal Expo 2015 in Paris. These include the Best Airport in the Middle East award as well as the second position as the Best Airport in Performance and Services. HIA has also won the 'Strategic Project of the Year' award at the 2015 Global Projects of the Year awards ceremony organised by CG/LA Infrastructure. \nHIA has also performed well in the surveys conducted by Airport Service Quality (ASQ) in the first quarter of 2015. This includes being ranked first in the Middle East for Cleanliness of Airport Terminal, Speedy Baggage Delivery and Comfort of Waiting Areas. \nAt the heart of Hamad International Airport is Qatar Duty Free, the airport’s award-winning shopping emporium with more than 40,000 square metres of combined retail and dining with more than 70 boutiques and 30 cafés and restaurants. QDF offers an unprecedented selection of designer labels, electronics, gourmet foods and much more. It also boasts an extensive portfolio of luxury brands and unique retail concepts, and is home to the largest perfume and cosmetics hall in any airport worldwide. HIA is also home to the Middle East’s first branch of Harrods. \nEqually important though for passengers is the transit hotel which was established in the terminal and of course Qatar Airways’ premium lounge which is arguably the largest found in any airport around the world. \nThe airline serves six destinations in Eastern Africa, spanning from Entebbe over Kigali to Nairobi, Kilimanjaro, Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, offering their award winning services to a growing number of passengers traveling with them via Doha to the rest of the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:34:06.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
