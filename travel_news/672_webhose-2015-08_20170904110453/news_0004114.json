The number of cities with operating urban rail transit lines in mainland China has increased from 5 to 22 during the period of 2002-2014. And Shanghai ranks first in the running mileage of the urban rail transit which has surpassed 530 kilometers while cities like Zhengzhou and Harbin only report less than 30 kilometers.\nBy the end of 2014, among all of the 22 Chinese cities with operating urban rail transit lines, Shanghai ranks first in the total length of operating network with 539.2 kilometers and 14 lines, Beijing second with 520.3 kilometers and 18 lines, Guangzhou third with 245.4 kilometers and 9 lines, Chongqing fourth with 192.6 kilometers and 4 lines and Shenzhen fifth with 176.3 kilometers and 5 lines.\nOver the last decade, the number of cities with urban rail transit in mainland China has rose from 8 to 22 with the number of operating lines rising from 17 to 83, the overall length of operating lines rising to 2699.6 kilometers with an average annual growth of 231.8 kilometers and the number of stations in operation rising from 237 to 1770.\nThe average annual growth rate of operating line was 109.7 kilometers during the first half of the past decade and 353.9 kilometers in the second half (hitting a record of 454.1 kilometers in 2010), three times that of the first half. By the end of 2014, three cities have a urban rail transit operation network measuring above 200 kilometers and four cities have the urban rail transit operating network measured above 200 kilometers in three cities and between 100-200 kilometers in four cities in China . And the urban rail transit in the top 2 cities, i.e. Shanghai and Beijing will undergo a rapid development, so does that in other cities.\nBy the first half of 2015, 39 cities have got their recent construction plan approved by the Chinese government. And it is estimated that by 2020, urban rail transit is set to open in about 50 cities with the total operating mileage reaching 6000-7000 kilometers and covering all major cities in China .\nThe total investment in the Chinese urban rail transit industry is estimated to surpass CNY 2 trillion during the period of 2015-2020, which creates many investment opportunities for related companies in the industrial chain.\nCompanies Mentioned\n- Alstom\n- Bombardier Transportation\n- CRRC Corporation Limited\n- Siemens\nFor more information visit\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bxc9vj/research_report\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/research-report-on-chinas-urban-rail-transit-industry-2015-2020-300129168.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bxc9vj/research_report", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-report-on-chinas-urban-rail-transit-industry-2015-2020-300129168.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN80550&Transmission_Id=201508171010PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN80550&DateId=20150817", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:10:36.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
