He was airlifted to CHR hospital in Lille, France. The other Marine was stabbed, and has been taken to the central hospital of Arras with serious but not life-threatening injuries. \nIn Washington, the Pentagon said it \"can only confirm that one U.S. military member was injured in the incident. The injury is not life-threatening.\" \nThe White House issued a statement saying that President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, and said, \"While the investigation into the attack is in its early stages, it is clear that their heroic actions may have prevented a far worse tragedy.\" \nAddressing reporters at the station in Arras, northern France, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve praised their bravery. \n'I would like to express our gratitude to and admiration for these two American passengers,' said Cazeneuve. \n'Thanks to the calm composure of the two American passengers, we have avoided a tragedy. Without them we would have faced a terrible drama.' \n'They were particularly courageous and showed extreme bravery in extremely difficult circumstances.' \nThe suspected terrorist had at least six full magazines of ammunition holding almost 200 rounds. He was also carrying a knife. \nA spokesman for the train company Thalys said: 'The situation is under control, the travellers are safe. The train stopped and the emergency services are on site.' \nNo one at the SNCF French railways was immediately available to comment on the report. \nA report on Twitter said that US Marines detained the gunman until emergency services arrived. \nThe incident happened at approximately 6pm local time. \nThe motives behind the attack were not immediately known, although a spokesman for the interior minister said: 'It is too early to speak of a terrorist link'. \nThe incident happened approximately 115 miles north of Paris near the town of Arras. \nInvestigators from France's special anti-terror police are leading the investigation, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office said. \nTwo of the victims are in a critical condition. The suspect is a 26-year-old Moroccan, said Sliman Hamzi, an official with police union Alliance. \nA spokesman for the French state rail company SNCF said that the assailant was armed with guns and knives but gave no further details about the attack. \nAn American and a Briton were reportedly among those injured. \nThe gunman was arrested after the train pulled into the station in the northern French town of Arras, the SNCF spokesman told AFP. \nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was heading to Arras in the wake of the incident, which occurred shortly after 6pm local time. \nHis spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet confirmed to AFP that a man had opened fire on the train but said that at this stage \"we do not know his motives\". \nThe French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, who appeared in the 1986 cult film 'Betty Blue' staring Beatrice Dalle, was lightly injured. \nThalys said on its website that several trains had been delayed after the 'intervention of security forces at Arras station'. \n'The train is at the station and emergency services are at the scene,' said Thalys, which is jointly owned by the national rail companies of Belgium, France and Germany. \nFrance remains on edge after Islamic extremists attacked the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January. \nIn June, a man beheaded his boss and tried to blow up a gas plant in southern France in what prosecutors say was an attack inspired by ISIS. \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware of reports of shots being fired on a train in France. \n'The French authorities have responded, we are in contact with them and are urgently seeking more information.' \nInterior ministry spokesman Pierre Henry Brandet said: ‘A man opened fire on this Thalys train between Amsterdam and Paris, one person was very seriously injured. Talking about a terrorist motive would be premature at the moment.’ \nFrancois Hollande, the French president, has said: ‘I express my solidarity with the wounded from the attack on the train from Amsterdam to Paris. Everything is being done to shed light on this tragedy.’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:38:01.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
