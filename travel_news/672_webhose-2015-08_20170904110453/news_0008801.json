The Schilthorn above Mürren in Switzerland, the scene of Ernst Stavro Blofeld’s hideout in the film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, two years ago opened Bond World 007, a museum dedicated to the film, and this week added to it with the launch of the 007 Walk of Fame. • James Bond's greatest moments on skis James Bond actor George Lazenby with his information board George Lazenby, who played Bond in the 1969 film, was on hand to open the attraction, which features a number of handprints from actors from the film, as well as information about the cast and filming. • James Bond filming locations around Britain It was here that a number of the alpine chases from the film were shot, including the one in which Lazenby's Bond finishes up wearing just one ski. In the winter, the Schilthorn marks the top of the annual Inferno race More than 1,000 people visited the Schilthorn on Saturday, the opening day of the new walkway. The 2,970m peak is also the start point for the annual Inferno ski race. Spectre, the new Bond film to be released in November, is also expected to feature alpine chases, with Sölden in Austria used as a filming location . As Spectre is the name of Blofeld’s evil organisation, it is rumoured the Bond baddy will make an appearance.
