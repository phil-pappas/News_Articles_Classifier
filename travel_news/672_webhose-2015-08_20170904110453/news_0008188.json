Photo courtesy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Global Entry is a voluntary U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) program that allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers after arriving in the United States from international flights. The pilot program, International Registered Traveler, was launched on April 11, 2008, at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.\nThe rule to make the program permanent was finalized on February 6, 2012.\nTravelers must be pre-approved for the Global Entry program. All applicants undergo a rigorous background check and in-person interview before enrollment. Global Entry is open to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, citizens of Germany, the Netherlands, Panama, and South Korea, and Mexican nationals. Canadian citizens and residents can participate in Global Entry through membership in the NEXUS program .\nU.S. citizens enrolled in Global Entry may use Australia’s Smartgate system without having to register, but are still required to have a visa to enter the country . Citizens may also apply for the following: The Netherlands’ Fast Low Risk Universal Crossing (FLUX) program, the Korean SES program, Panama's Global Pass, Germany’s Easy Pass or the Mexican Viajero Confiable program for expedited entry into those countries. Additional fees and enrollment interviews will apply. U.S. citizens with Global Entry membership traveling to New Zealand may use a dedicated lane arriving at Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch airports.\nTravelers must go through the application process , which is done online, and pay a $100 non-refundable fee. After your application is reviewed, CBP sends a message in your Global Online Enrollment System account so you can schedule an interview at one of 37 Global Entry Enrollment Centers .\nDuring the interview, a CBP officer asks questions, takes your photo and scans your fingerprints. Applicants must bring a valid passport and one other form of identification, such as a driver's license or ID card. Lawful permanent residents must present their permanent resident card. Once approved, Global Entry is valid for five years with no additional charges.\nParticipants enter the U.S. by using automated kiosks at 42 U.S airports and 13 preclearance airports . The preclearance airports are: Abu Dhabi International Airport; Aruba’s Queen Beatrix International Airport; Calgary International Airport; Ireland’s Dublin Airport; Edmonton International Airport; Guam International Airport; Halifax Stanfield International Airport; Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport; Nassau, Bahamas’ Sir Lynden Pindling International Airport; Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport; Northern Mariana Islands’ Saipan International Airport; Ireland’s Shannon Airport; Toronto Pearson International Airport; Vancouver International Airport; and Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport.\nUpon entering the United States, travelers with Global Entry cards can go straight to kiosks, where they insert their machine-readable passport or U.S. permanent resident card, place their fingertips on the scanner for fingerprint verification and complete a customs declaration. But Global Entry members no longer have to complete a paper customs declaration form before arrival.\nThe kiosk issues a receipt and directs the traveler to baggage claim and a special Global Entry exit. But if the receipt has an \"X,” travelers must report to a CBP officer at the nearest staffed passport control booth. An officer will review your documents, determine the reason for the \"X\" -- including random inspection; your fingerprints may not have matched; or other issues -- and either release you from there or refer you to secondary for additional processing.\nTravelers with Global Entry cards also have access to the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) PreCheck program , which allows for expedited airport screening at TSA checkpoints in specific airports.\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Please follow my travel-related magazines on Flipboard: Best of About Travel , a joint curation venture with my fellow About Travel Experts; and Travel-Go!
