Flowers left all over the Kigali Memorial Centre grounds urge visitors to never forget the atrocities that occurred in Rwanda. Contributed photos by Rae Wilson \nOne newspaper printed the infamous Hutu Ten Commandments which branded any Hutu a traitor if they interacted with Tutsis, mixed married couples included. \nThere were road blocks and house-to-house searches to hunt down the Tutsis. \nNeighbours turned on each other, friends too. Even mixed families turned into brutal, sadistic killers seemingly overnight. \nTutsis were murdered in the streets and slaughtered in their own homes. \nThe photos and video footage of the bloodshed is horrific. \nBodies piled on top of each other. \nMums. Dads. Children. Grandparents. \nPeople used machetes, clubs, guns or any blunt tool they could find. \nHIV positive perpetrators raped women, often in front of their own families. \nMany of those half a million rape victims who survived have subsequently either died from aids or still suffer under the debilitating disease. \nChildren saw their parents tortured and killed before their own bodies were sliced up, pulverised and discarded. \nThere are still mass graves discovered and victims reburied with dignity. \nVideos throughout the exhibition show victims sharing their haunting accounts of the nightmare that engulfed the tiny country during the 1990s. \nInterviewers have gone door to door since 2004 recording thousands of stories, indentifying victims and collecting photographs from the survivors of lost family members. \nThe generally accepted view within Rwanda seems to be that the international media mostly ignored the events in Rwanda. \nRwanda is known as the country of a thousand hills, with incredible vistas and green fields in contrast with much of Africa. \nThe pride the Rwandan people take in their surroundings is evident, making it easily the cleanest place I visited in East Africa. \nBut that beauty belies the dark past which is etched in the pained faces of too many. \nThe Kigali centre teaches that genocide is never spontaneous; rather that is an intentional act of multiple murders, aimed at destroying the presence of the victim group. \nIts perpetrators do not respect age, gender, occupation, religion or status. \nThe exhibition not only details what happened in Rwanda but gives a snapshot of some of the other genocides in the past century. \nAgain, I felt part of the cover up, not knowing about Namibia, Armenia and several others explained in about 100 words each. \nEducation is the key. \nNo matter how overwhelming places like the Kigali Memorial Centre are - and trust me it's hard not to shed a few tears - they are vitally important for future generations. \nTOP STORIES ONLINE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T01:48:37.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
