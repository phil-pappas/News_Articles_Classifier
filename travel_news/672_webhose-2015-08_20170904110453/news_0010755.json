The exposure it great. The silhouetted duck along with the soft and fading mountainscape keep to the same beautiful gray-blue palette. I might crop up just slightly to get those rocks in the lower-left out of the frame to clean it up. This looks like the perfect way to start your 30s.” Most Read Stories \nShare your recent photo from around the Northwest. Submit online at seattletimes.com/northwestphotos .
