But there is an art to timing your trip so that you maximise your chances of decent weather. Although never completely predictable, summer tends to break at different times in different parts of Europe. So broadly speaking, the later you are planning to travel, the further south or south east you should head. To help you choose, we have compiled a guide to the next couple of months, picking out the destinations which are still likely to be at their best. To give you a taste of what is still available, we have also listed tour operators which specialise in each destination. For further advice, including recommended hotels, resorts, sights and restaurants, see the link to our expert guides which we give at the end of each entry. All prices Quote: d below are per person, for a week, excluding flights unless stated otherwise. Early September Hot sunny weather is the norm in virtually all southern Europe for the first couple of weeks in September. Prices remain relatively high, though still well below school holiday rates. Majorca Bookings are strong this September, but the sheer range of accommodation and flights to Majorca make it a good bet for late bookers. Bookings are strong this September, but the sheer range of accommodation and flights to Majorca make it a good bet for late bookers. Coastline (0844 557 1020; coastline.co.uk ) still has a few villas available - Ca’n Andreu, sleeps four in three bedrooms and is within walking distance of the old town of Pollensa. It single-storey with a raised pool and costs £745 per person, based on maximum occupancy, including flights and car hire, departing September 5. See our expert's recommended hotels in Majorca Sardinia (Fotolia/AP) Sardinia Sardinia’s season is relatively short because it is based around the Italian tradition of taking a break in July and August. Travel in early September and you will still bask in temperatures of around 26C, but prices have dropped, and the beaches will be much quieter. Sardinian Places (0845 330 2050; sardinianplaces.co.uk ) can offer Lu Triuzzu near Santa Teresina, a comfortable, three-bedroom villa with pool from £898 per person, a reduction of £100 each, based on six sharing and including easyJet flights from Gatwick to Olbia and car hire, departing September 5. See our expert's recommended hotels in Sardinia The Cyclades This clutch of Greek islands between the mainland and Crete offers tremendous variety - from the hedonistic clubbing and restaurant scene of Mykonos, to the spectacular views of Santorini, and quieter Naxos and Paros. Sunvil (020 8758 4758; sunvil.co.uk) offers the family-run Birikos Apartments close to Aghios Prokopios on Naxos with a large shared pool. A seven-night stay costs from £835 per person, based on four people sharing a one-bedroom apartment, including flights from Gatwick and transfers, departing in early September. See our expert's recommended hotels in the Cyclades Late September The last two weeks in September should offer decent weather all around the Med, but it may start to get a little uncertain and chilly, especially in the evenings, in more northerly destinations. It’s a great time for a sightseeing or foodie holiday however, so we have picked out one good bet for beaches, and a couple for a more rural, cultural break. Crete (Fotolia/AP) Crete For real heat, Crete is an excellent bet at this time of year. It’s one of the most southerly of the Mediterranean islands, and generally stays hot and dry right into October. Most operators still have plenty of availability on flights and accommodation. Pure Crete (01444 880404; purecrete.com) for example can offer Sirens House in Kalami Western Crete, sleeping up to four, with good views over Souda bay and close to a beach. This costs £784 per person including flights for a seven-night stay, based on two sharing, departing September 15. See our expert's recommended hotels in Crete Tuscany Fresh figs, grapes, mushrooms, chestnuts, truffles, olive oil - autumn in Tuscany is a wonderful season for foodies. It’s warm enough to enjoy the pool in the middle of the day, and while Florence and Siena won’t exactly be crowd-free, they won’t be as manic as in August and the school holidays, and temperatures are much more pleasant for sightseeing. Simpson Exclusive (0208 003 3931; simpsonexclusive.com is offering seven nights at Il Borgo villa from £565 per person based on six sharing. The price includes flights from London Gatwick to Pisa with easyJet and two hire cars, departing on September 19. See our expert's recommended hotels in Tuscany Provence Like Tuscany, Provence has a rich autumn harvest, and temperatures are still warm enough - 24C average daily highs - to enjoy the long sunny days. Through Dominique’s villas (020 3265 1052; dominiquesvillas.co.uk ) Maison Vignes (villa ref: PR74), a village house with small heated pool, sleeping up to six in Roussillon, costs £2,390 (rental only) from September 26. See our expert's recommended hotels in Provence Tuscany (Fotolia/AP) Early October By now, the options for serious sunseekers are beginning to narrow. You need to head well south and accept that there may be some hiccups in the weather. The good news is that this is one of the cheapest times of year to book. The Turkish Coast The summer season lingers well into October on the south coast of Turkey - good for golfers and walkers, but also for those wanting a beach-based holiday. Simpson Travel (0208 003 6557; simpsontravel.com ) offers a week at Simpson Secret Akyaka, a one-bedroom cottage with good views and lap pool, at £885 per person, based on two sharing, including flights and car hire departing on October 4. See our expert's recommended hotels on the Turkish Coast The Algarve Another destination with a long season - partly because of the many golfers who come in autumn and winter, but also because temperatures hold up around 23C throughout October, with seven hours of sun a day. Vintage Travel (01954 261 431; vintagetravel.co.uk ) has plenty of availability including Casa do Ludo (sleeping up to six), a three-bedroom, modern villa near the village of Almancil on the Algarve with a private swimming pool. It costs £795 for the villa (rental only) from October 4 or £750 from October 10. See our expert's recommended hotels on the Algarve Sicily Sicily offers a wonderful combination of historical sites - from the Ancient Greeks, to the Normans and the 18th-century Baroque, a spectacular coastline, some lovely resorts and a long, warm autumn. Operators say that availability is good in early October, but selling well. Long Travel (01694 722193; long-travel.co.uk ) can offer Monoresort, a collection of five luxury apartments close to the historic centre of Modica. From £750 per week for two people, including car hire, departing October 3 (dates flexible). See our expert's recommended hotels in Sicily October half term This is one the trickiest times to find some reliable weather without enduring a long flight. Marrakesh is the closest of our three selections (3 hours 30 minutes flight time), while Cyprus and the Canaries are about four and a half hours away. This year, most schools break up on Friday, October 23. As a result, prices in this week spike upwards. They may drop if bookings don’t materialise, but there will always be pressure on flights, so waiting is risky. Cyprus Cyprus has perhaps the mildest climate in the entire Mediterranean and is a great option for families looking for warmth and prices well below the August peak. Sunvil (020 8758 4759; sunvil.co.uk ) can offer the Kotsias Hotel Apartments in Pissouri Bay, close to the beach, watersports and restaurants. It has a shared pool and costs from £1,147 per person, based on four sharing a two-bedroom apartment, with return flights from Gatwick and car hire, departing October 24. See our expert's recommended hotels in Cyprus Tenerife Tenerife’s mega resorts aren’t every family’s cup of tea, but they do offer plenty of sunshine, big beaches, and a big choice of good-value accommodation. There are more interesting options too - rural accommodation in the greener north of the island can be much more characterful. Cachet Travel (020 8847 8700; cachet-travel.co.uk ) specialises in this and can offer Finca Las Barandas, a cluster of individual cottages set in a mango and avocado plantation just outside the traditional town of Icod de los Vinos. Prices start at £922 based on four people sharing a two-bedroom cottage, including flights and car hire, departing on October 25. See our expert's recommended hotels in Tenerife Tenerife (Fotolia/AP) Marrakesh This fascinating desert city is a great option for families looking to introduce their children to a new culture and also enjoy a respite from late autumn in Britain. Specialist operators say that there is a lot of pressure on flights around the half-term weekends, but it works well as a short-break holiday, so check on skycanner.net to find the best times to travel and book one of our recommended hotels in our expert guide.
