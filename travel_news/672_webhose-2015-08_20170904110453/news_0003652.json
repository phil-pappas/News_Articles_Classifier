But isn't it a bit unfair that other flowers seem to miss out on the festivities? \nFear not, as many spas around the country have incorporated other flowers into their Mother's Day spa treatments. \nIf you decide to treat your mama to a day of pampering at the spa, be creative and opt for a good \"no jasmine\" treatment. Okura Spa at the Okura Prestige Bangkok is offering a new treatment derived from Hokkaido lavender flowers. Lavender is the queen of nerve tonics, with effective stress-busting properties that allow for better sleep (which mums need). \nTo highlight the hotel's concept of contemporary Japanese hospitality, the spa has created the \"Soothing Lavender Treatment\" to associate with the blooming seasons in Japan. This time of year is when Hokkaido is awash with blooms of purple lavender. \nIn addition to the relaxing, your mother will love the chilled butterfly pea-infused tea (also purple in colour), served to boost the mood. The treatment starts with a warm foot bath in a large, wooden bowl, the best moment of which occurs when a therapist pours on the feet lavender oil imported from Provence, France -- its invigorating scent will send even the most stressed out person into euphoria. \nYour mother will also enjoy being gently rubbed and scrubbed with a mixture of lavender powder, salt and ground walnut shell. Walnut shell is said to be among the gentlest choices for skin exfoliation, and I couldn't agree more. The scrub is so soft that it feels silky on the skin. \nNow, the highlight of the treatment. Lavender essential oil combined with a good massage is nothing short of heavenly. To illustrate just how soothing, let's just say not many people can avoid falling asleep during the treatment. \nDon't write this treatment off just because you've previously had a bad experience with lavender scent. There's artificial lavender, and then there's fresh, real lavender -- and Okura Spa is all about authenticity. \nIf you're allergic to the flower, well, that's another story. \nThe 90-minute Soothing Lavender Treatment is priced at B3,800++ per person. It is available until Aug 31. Visit www.okurabangkok.com or call 02-687-9000.
