The International Business Forum will educate local, national and international companies on Mexico’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community which has continued to position itself as an important part of the country’s cultural, political and economic landscape. \nAccording to Rubén Sandoval, CEO of LGBT Confex, the Forum will introduce Mexico’s LGBT community, its needs and influence as well as ways to market to it to those companies seeking to attract members of this segment. Training and educational session on client services and the development of inclusive policies in the workplace will also be provided. Participants will also learn about new initiatives in the tourism industry, new corporate strategies, film, technology, media and educational tourism. “In Mexico, the LGBT community is gaining many rights, including marriage equality and in terms of tourism, the segment is estimated to spend almost 50% more than heterosexual travelers. Participants of the LGBT Confex International Business Forum are not necessarily of the community, but are those businesses that want to know about it and target it in their promotional campaigns” said Sandoval. “Over 65% of the participants identify as straight but come to the forum, not only to sell, but to position themselves within the market, be trained and take advantage of networking opportunities. Many of our participants have been with us in all our editions because they have seen the importance of this market in their own corporations.” Confirmed exhibitors for this year include IGLTA, HRC Foundation, the city of Fort Lauderdale, the CVBs of Saltillo and Monterrey, and the Ministry of Tourism of the states of Guerrero, Veracruz and Puebla. In addition, international properties such as Hampton Inn by Hilton (Merida), Hotel Alamandas (Costalegre), Hotel Casa Velas Boutique (Puerto Vallarta),Hotel Hard Rock (Cancun, Vallarta, Riviera Maya), Marriott ( JW Ciudad de Mexico, JW Cancun, JW Santa Fe, Casa Magna Vallarta) and Mexitours/ Leemba Travel and Gay Travel Guide.
