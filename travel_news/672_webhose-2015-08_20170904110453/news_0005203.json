Despite its length it is not, as is sometimes claimed, visible from space. \nConstruction first begun in the third century BCE, but nearly 6,300km were built in the Ming Dynasty of 1368-1644, including the much-visited sectors north of the capital Beijing. Of that, 1,962km has melted away over the centuries, the Beijing Times reported. \nSome of the construction weathered away, while plants growing in the walls have accelerated the decay, said the report, citing a survey last year by the Great Wall of China Society. \n“Even though some of the walls are built of bricks and stones, they cannot withstand the perennial exposure to wind and rain,” the paper quoted Dong Yaohui, a vice president of the society, as saying. \n“Many towers are becoming increasingly shaky and may collapse in a single rain storm in summer.” \nTourism and local residents’ activities are also damaging the longest human construction in the world, the paper added. \nPoor villagers in Lulong county in the northern province of Hebei used to knock thick grey bricks from a section of wall in their village to build homes, and slabs engraved with Chinese characters were sold for 30 yuan (RM18) each by local residents, it said. \nUnder Chinese regulations people who take bricks from the Great Wall can be fined up to 5,000 yuan (RM3,036), the state-run Global Times said. \n“But there is no specific organisation to enforce the rules. Damage could only be reported to higher authorities and it is hard to solve when it happened on the border of two provinces,” said Jia Hailin, a cultural relics protection official in Hebei, according to the report. \nIt added that explorations of undeveloped parts of the Great Wall – an increasingly popular leisure activity in recent years – had brought those sections more tourists than they could bear, damaging them severely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T22:38:11.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
