The new additions will bring Powder White’s offering to a total of 55 chalets across the big five European resorts. \nVerbier will see the launch of Chalet Mont Gele, sleeping up to 30 guests and making it Powder White’s largest chalet in the programme. With ski in / ski out access, the chalet is situated just a few metres above the main Medran lift, leading to the Four Valleys ski circuit. Perfect for families who can only get away for the weekend or groups of friends looking for flexibility, Chalet Mont Gele offers the hugely successful Powder White Weekends programme. The chalet is available for a full week or just a short break of three to four days. All of Powder White’s properties are located around the new centre of Verbier, close to the action, the best bars and restaurants and close to the newly extended piste into Place Blanch. There’s also a major expansion this season for Powder White in Val d’Isere with six new chalets added. Chalet Acajuma is brand new to the market and sleeps up to 11 guests. Set over three floors, the chalet comes complete with an open plan kitchen, living room and dining room as well as an indoor Jacuzzi and large windows overlooking the resort. Also added to the programme is The Nokota Chalet, sleeping eight guests and close to the Escape Killy ski circuit. To unwind after a long day on the slopes, head to the famous La Folice Douce, just minutes away from the chalet and one of the best après-ski spots in France. Val d’Isere will also see the launch of The Marwari Chalet, sleeping eight guests and set in a peaceful location, away from the main high street, for those looking for something a little quieter. The Pinto Chalet also sleeps eight guests and is just a short walk to the main Solaise and Bellevarde ski lifts. Petit and Grand Chevril Chalets round off the new offerings in Val d’lsere; both are part of a traditional freestanding chalet in the heart of the resort. The chalets are perfect for smaller groups, sleeping between six and eight guests. For larger groups or two big families, there’s the option to take over both chalets for the week. There are two new chalets in Austria’s St Anton. Chalet Haus Christophe sleeps up to eight guests and is positioned in the wooded Mooserkreuz area. Set in an ideal location, Chalet Haus Christophe offers ski in / ski out access and is close to Moosewirt bar, one of St Anton’s most popular après-ski hot spots, the perfect place to enjoy a cocktail or two after a long day on the slopes. Also new to St Anton is Chalet Seeberger, sleeping up to 21 guests and offering a large open living/dining room plan with a terrace overlooking the local lifts and slopes. The popular Three Valleys resort of Meribel will see the addition of Chalet Sandy. Set in a prime location, the chalet has easy access to the Doron piste and on into Chaudanne, which is the main lift station providing quick access to both the Courchevel and Val Thorens Valleys. Born from a desire to put the flexibility back into the ski holiday, Powder White will continue its tailor-made approach this season with self-catering, part-catered and fully-catered chalet board options all available to guests. With an emphasis on hearty, restaurant quality cuisine, guests enjoy hot cooked breakfasts, afternoon teas, pre-dinner Champagne and canapés and three-course dinners with select dinner wines and unlimited house red, white and rose wines. All chalets come complete with free Wi-Fi, ipod docks, laptops and flat-screen TV and DVD libraries with a wealth of pre-bookable extras – from additional Champagne provisions to in-chalet ski fitting all bookable as part of the tailor-made service.
