Businesses can also display their website or event agenda on the landing page when Wi-FI is accessed, strengthening their branding by tailoring connectivity. And, to launch the new technology, the venue is inviting corporate clients to hold their meetings, product launches, seminars or AGMs at a special rate in September and October – and extend their visit with a discounted overnight stay. The 73-bedroom, four star hotel offers a choice of 11 conference rooms – some dating back to the 14th century - accommodating up to 150 delegates and all with wireless and cabled broadband, LCD projectors, screens and PC laptops. In addition the hotel, which has ample free parking and a helipad, can provide a secretarial service and arrange a variety of team building activities and entertainment, such as Elizabethan banquets and murder mystery dinners. Its nine acres of grounds provide an ideal setting for outdoor activities such as clay pigeon shooting, while Lumley Castle’s renowned Black Knight restaurant is able to cater for formal or buffet lunches and dinners and can also offer private dining. The hotel’s Autumn Delegates package includes room hire, a two-course working lunch or buffet, mid-morning and afternoon refreshments, water and flip charts, from as little as £29 per person, excluding VAT. And those wishing to prolong their visit can enjoy an overnight stay in a Courtyard bedroom, with breakfast the following morning for the special rate of £75 between Sunday and Thursday. Daily rates for the enhanced Wi-Fi options are £50 for the dedicated Wi-Fi speed and £100 for the company branded Wi-Fi.
