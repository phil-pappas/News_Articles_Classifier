This growth is increasing the biosecurity risk to New Zealand,” said Gilbert.\n“Another reason is the heightened threat posed by Queensland fruit fly host material arriving in New Zealand. There has been an increase in fruit fly populations in Australia and the fly has been spreading into previously pest-free areas.”\nPrimary Industries Minister Nathan Guy welcomed the strengthening of biosecurity measures, saying, “It’s important to note that we already have 100 percent screening of all passengers by biosecurity officers.”\nThe government announced in May that it would introduce a passenger border levy to fund biosecurity services a move that has drawn objections from the tourism industry.\nNew Zealand maintains a strict biosecurity regime to protect its agricultural industries and its unique indigenous flora and fauna.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:22:18.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
