Amtrak Guest Rewards has also launched a helpful points estimator tool, which shows customers exactly how many points they will earn for their travel or how many points they will need to redeem for an Amtrak trip.\nFor more information about the revamped Amtrak Guest Rewards program and to access the points estimator, please visit AmtrakGuestRewards.com/RideOn .\nSOURCE Amtrak\nRELATED LINKS\nhttp://www.amtrak.com/", "external_links": ["http://amtrakguestrewards.com/RideOn", "http://www.amtrak.com/"], "published": "2015-08-27T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:13:28.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
