But Kates extols the advantages of getting away from the urban core.\n“Arizona is known for its deep, dark skies,” Kates said. “You can live in Phoenix or Tucson and still be just an hour or so from a great spot to see the stars.”\nLost Dutchman is a great viewing spot not only because it’s away from the Valley’s light pollution, Kates said. The view of the Superstition Mountains, even in silhouette, is a beautiful backdrop on a night when visitors are likely to see as many as 80 meteors an hour.\n“This is shaping up to be a good year,” Kates said. “We may get up to 100 an hour when it peaks Wednesday. But even if we see only 30 or 40, I’ll be ecstatic.”\nThank the Swift-Tuttle comet for a fireworks show that even Disneyland could never reproduce. Cosmic ice balls traveling at 130,000 mph tend to shed a lot of debris, Kates said, and Earth rolls through Swift-Tuttle’s tailings every August.\nThe process of incineration is never more beautiful than during meteor showers, Kates said. Objects ranging in size from grains of sand to watermelons hit the atmosphere about 70 miles above the Earth, vaporizing in a streak of fire and sparks.\nThe Perseids shower should start to peak at about 11 p.m. Wednesday.\nMeteor Madness starts at 8 p.m. with music, food vendors and a beer grotto staffed by local breweries. (Moderation is encouraged because too many brews can spoil the view, especially if the world starts spinning.)\nKates will lead a star talk at 9:30 p.m., and at 11 p.m. visitors should be reclined in lawn chairs looking skyward until dawn.\nThere’s only one thing that could bring the curtain down.\n“Cloud cover can ruin everything,” Kates said. “I’m hoping the monsoon is a non-soon.”\nMeteor Madness with Dr. Sky\nWhat: Steve Kates (Dr. Sky) hosts a viewing of the annual Perseids meteor shower.
