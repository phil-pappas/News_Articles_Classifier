However, that number is about to increase. \nSeveral US companies are interested in offering cruises to Cuba after the thaw between the two countries under the people-to-people general license administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. \nUnited Caribbean Lines announced a deluxe ferry service between Cuba and Florida starting in the late fall of 2015, after obtaining a license from the US Department of Treasury. But they are still waiting for confirmation from the Cuban government, which they expect will occur this month. Bruce Nierenberg, the President of UCL, said he already asked the OFAC to extend its operating license to cruise ships. \nThis week, Pear Seas Cruises, a small ship cruise company, announced at least six trips starting in 2016, where people could experience the history and heritage of Cuba on a 10-night, round trip. During the travel, passengers \"could engage first hand with the local tradespeople, artists, musicians and historians\". \n“Our people-to-people exchange will be centered around several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Old Havana and its Fortification System, San Pedro de la Roca Castle, Santiago de Cuba, Trinidad and the Valley de los Ingenios, Urban Historic Centre of Cienfuegos and Alejandro de Humboldt National Park,” Pearl Seas Cruises stated in a press release. \nHaimark Line announced luxury voyages from Miami to Cuba beginning 20 February 2016, according to a report from the Sun Sentinel. The company plans to have 15 nine-night-long cruises to Cuba on the luxury 105-cabin Saint Laurent ship. \nAlso, Carnival Corp. unveiled plans for cultural cruises starting in May 2016. They intend for fathom, the new purpose-travel brand, to begin full-week sailings to Cuba, in addition to fathom's full-week sailings to the Dominican Republic, said a press release made by the company. \n“We are excited about receiving U.S. approval as the very important first step to ultimately take travelers to Cuba under the existing 12 criteria for authorized travel. We look forward to working with the Cuban authorities for their approval to help make the social, cultural and humanitarian exchanges between U.S. citizens and the people of Cuba a reality,” said Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation. \nDonald recognized there is a strong demand from travelers who want to immerse themselves in Cuban culture. \nTara Russell, president of fathom and global impact lead for Carnival Corporation, added: \"We're incredibly excited and humbled by this potential opportunity to help travelers experience the amazing beauty and culture of Cuba, while being able to provide educational and cultural exchange activities that will benefit both the traveler and the Cuban people\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:46:58.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
