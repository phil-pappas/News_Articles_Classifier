The make-up of MCFC’s fan base is already international and through a scheme like Sky Blue, fans around the world can have access to joint benefits including discounted flights, match tickets and money-can’t-buy fan experiences all in one place.”\nEffective immediately, fans can sign up to the Etihad Guest Sky Blue program by enrolling into Etihad Guest. Existing Etihad Guest members are also eligible to join the Sky Blue program and take advantage of the benefits offered.\nSky Blue members will qualify for a 10 per cent discount on Etihad Airways flights, 10 per cent discount on Etihad Holidays for UK and UAE members, eligibility to win free tickets to matches and have access to special rewards and discounts on club merchandise. They can also take part in tours of the Etihad Stadium to get a flavour of what it is like to be a Premier League star from behind the scenes.\nDiego Gigliani, Director of Media and Fan Relationship Management for City Football Marketing, which manages MCFCs’ commercial partnerships, said: “Through the new and improved Sky Blue program, Etihad Guest will bring even more benefits to loyal MCFC fans around the globe. It’s yet another example of the strength of our relationship with Etihad Airways and its commitment to providing fantastic experiences for our fans.”\nThe UAE is already home to many MCFC supporters, who will be able to cheer on their team with fellow fans, as they watch games screened live at dedicated Fan Zones in Abu Dhabi. Members of the program will also have access to special rates for City Football Schools, for those younger footballers who are training like the next Sergio Aguero, Joe Hart or David Silva.\nEtihad Airways has been MCFC’s main club partner since May 2009, with the club enjoying considerable success during that time, picking up four trophies including two as the Barclays Premier League Champions. The Etihad Stadium is the centre piece of the Etihad Campus, which encompasses a large part of the Sport City site in East Manchester.\nSource:- Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:16:37.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
