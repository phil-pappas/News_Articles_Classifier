It will open in mid-August and feature 18 suites, a pool, meeting space, and a fitness center. Jett Mehta, president of the family-owned business, says employees have been hired and are currently in training at other properties, preparing for the Penn Yan property’s opening. The company also has completed a $1.3 million upgrade and renovation of its 94-room Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham located at the intersection of Fishers Road and Route 96 in Victor. Pittsford-based Indus, which also recently opened the Taco Bell restaurant on Lake Street in Penn Yan, is one of the largest licensees in the Microtel system of more than 325 hotels, which was founded in Rochester and is today based in New Jersey as part of the Wyndham Hotel Group. Mehta has served on Microtel’s Franchise Advisory Committee since 2004, and Indus has twice earned the Microtel Inn & Suites Franchisee of the Year Award. “Over the years, the Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham brand has earned a strong reputation for consistency, quality, and value among discerning travelers,” said Aly El-Bassuni, brand leader and vice president of operations for Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham. “Jett Mehta and the team at Indus have been essential in helping the brand to build that reputation and it’s because of owners like them—who believe in the brand and are willing to invest—that Microtel Inn & Suites by Wyndham continues to grow and be successful.” Two of Indus’s Microtel properties recently were awarded the 2015 TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence, based on stellar reviews from customers—with the hotel at 3258 Chili Ave., Rochester, earning this honor for three consecutive years, and the property at 550 Hamilton St. in Geneva earning the award for five consecutive years, which places the hotel in the TripAdvisor Hall of Fame. “We are committed to an optimal guest experience at each of our properties and our staff continually delivers on that promise,” Mehta said. “Indus is fortunate to be embraced by the communities we serve and we are proud to be a part of our region’s exceptional hospitality industry.” Indus Hospitality Group owns and operates more than 50 properties, primarily hotels and restaurants in the Rochester, Finger Lakes, and Western New York regions. Indus is family-owned and in its third decade of operation, having formed in 1988. There are currently more than 800 people working for the company, which also represents a variety of retail and real-estate ventures. The corporate offices are based in Pittsford. The team at Indus Hospitality Group has been recognized numerous times as first-class operators, earning national and regional awards, including the Dunkin’ Brands Rising Star of the Year, the Hilton Worldwide Lighthouse Award, and Trip Advisor Awards for Excellence.
