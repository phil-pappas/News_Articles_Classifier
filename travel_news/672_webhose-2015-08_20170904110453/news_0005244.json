That transaction came on the heels of Aetna's ( AET ) July 3 announcement that it would pay $37 billion for Humana ( HUM ) and Centene ( CNC ) July 2 revelation that it would buy Health Net ( HNT ) for $6.8 billion. \nThe Centene deal was cleared on Aug. 12 by federal regulators without an extended antitrust review, but state approvals are pending. \nThe string of deals comes amid fierce opposition to insurance industry consolidation from hospitals and physicians groups. It also comes in the wake of two studies, one from a congressional watchdog agency, warning that most states have only three primary providers in each of the key health insurance segments: large group, small group and individual plans. In its December 2014 study, the Government Accountability Office also found that, in at least 37 states, the three largest insurers control at least 80% of total enrollment. In five of those states, there was at least one market segment in which the largest insurer had at least 90% of all the enrollees. And the GAO found that the largest insurers increased their share of enrollment between 2002 and 2008. \nHealth insurance is a critical component of the U.S. health care system, and regulators need the market to remain highly competitive. In 2013, 58% of Americans under 65 had health coverage through employer-sponsored group health plans. About 8% of those under 65 had coverage through the individual market. \nOnly two months before the GAO's report, the American Medical Association, in its annual assessment of competition in the health insurance market, found that 72% of the metro areas it studied were highly concentrated and that in 90% of those areas at least one insurer had a market share of 30% or greater. In 41% of the metro areas the AMA examined, one insurer held at least half the market. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nThe AMA, which is the trade group for physicians, blamed the high concentration on consolidation and asserted that past health insurer mergers have led to the exercise of monopoly power with few of the potential cost savings being passed to consumers. The key issue for the latest string of mergers is whether statistics like those compel the Department of Justice, which is handling the antitrust reviews for each of them, to go beyond its traditional approach of evaluating the competitive effects of health insurance mergers according to their impact on local markets and to also consider whether the current round of consolidation presents a tipping point that obligates the agency to take into account the competitive effects nationally. \nTHE BETTING, BY BOTH supporters and opponents of the mergers being proposed, is that the DOJ will stay the course and approve the two remaining deals, albeit by requiring that the parties to each transaction make divestitures in a handful of markets where the two companies pairing up have significant overlaps. \nCertainly that's what the companies' management believes. \"There is a consensus [with Anthem antitrust counsel] of where there is overlap between our companies and that no substantive antitrust or insurance regulatory issues are present that would prevent completion of the transaction,\" Anthem CEO Joseph R. Swedish told analysts June 22 when discussing his company's overture to Cigna. \nFearing that the DOJ will stick to precedent in reviewing insurance deals, parties troubled by the acquisitions have urged the agency to go beyond the spot divestitures that have characterized previous antitrust settlements in the sector. Referring specifically to the Aetna and Anthem deals, American Hospital Association General Counsel Melinda Reid Hatton, warned in an Aug. 4 letter to DOJ antitrust chief Bill Baer that the agency should consider whether divestitures \"have any chance of ameliorating the enduring damage\" the merger of four of the five largest health insurers would pose to competition. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:07:30.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
