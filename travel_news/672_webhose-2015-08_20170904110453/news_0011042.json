It really just comes down to where you want to enjoy a picnic, a parade and beer kegs. \nSome may prefer to hang out around the house and enjoy a three-day weekend. But for those willing to venture out a bit, Arizona offers fun options “in every conceivable place” on Labor Day weekend. \n9/6: Brewery Gulch Daze \nBelieve it or not, Brewery Gulch in Bisbee once was among the rowdiest places between St. Louis and San Francisco, with 20 saloons and gambling halls that bustled with business from local miners.
