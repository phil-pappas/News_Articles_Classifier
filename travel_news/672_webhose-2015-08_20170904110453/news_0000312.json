Photo Credit: British Airways \n\nAs the 2015/16 Premier League season gets underway, British Airways puts Gary Lineker, ex-England Footballer and Television Pundit, in the First Class Hot Seat, asking him to make predictions about who will win the Premier League this football season. \n“For the Premier League, I’ll probably go for Chelsea again,\" Gary says. \n\"They’ve strengthened a bit and they were so dominant last season. I’ve got a feeling for Manchester United for the FA Cup, and my old club Spurs for the League Cup – it’s about time they won something.” \nConsidering this summer's big money signings, Gary thinks Manchester United's Schweinsteiger will be interesting to watch. \n\"Sterling going to Manchester City is going to be really interesting,\" he says. \n\"A lot of money – but if he realises the potential that he has, he might turn out to be a bargain!” \nPopularity of Football in Asia \nGary is encouraged by the growing popularity of football, which the Americans call soccer, in Asia. He says an increasing number of Asian fans are travelling to England to watch games live. \n\"The increase in interest in Asia means more people are coming here to watch our football, or becoming interested in our football, which is fantastic and believe me it’s worth the journey.\" Gary says. \n“If you can get tickets for a derby game, you’ll experience an atmosphere like never before. It’s electric. Witnessing a game where it means so much is really special; the speed, the pace, the physicality of the football, will be something that lives with you forever.” \nProximity of Airports to Stadiums \nLondon was 2 major international airports: Gatwick and Heathrow, and Heathrow is closest to Central London, where Arsenal, Chelsea, and Totthenham play home matches. \nArsenal plays home games at Emirates Stadium.
