Trip options include cultural highlights, big cities, rural villages, northern indigenous culture, Caribbean landscapes and active trekking trips.” \nThe Lost City Trekking seven-day tour leads in at £499 and includes full-board accommodation but does not include flights. Departures are available on a year-round basis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:01:19.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
