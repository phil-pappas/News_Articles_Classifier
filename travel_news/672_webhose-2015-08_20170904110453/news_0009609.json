The response to last year’s show was fantastic. The accessibility of Bluewater is second to none, being 5 minutes from the M25, and offering free parking. Everyone appreciated the ease of access, and the facilities are first rate. The success of last year’s show was better than we could have hoped for, and we’re really excited to be back with even more support from the golfing world, and lots of new ideas to make the show even better.”\nThe London Golf Show brings together the biggest and best names in golf, from the UK and around the world, provides a great platform for all within the golf industry to showcase their brand, and make sales to the ABC1 audience that attend. Ranging from equipment, clothing and accessories, to coaching and destinations, there is space for everyone to help grow the game. A unique ‘Golf Club Showcase’ adds to the inclusiveness, enabling Golf Clubs, no matter how small, access to the show and the thousands of visitors.\nThe Golf Tourism Show also returns. A major part of the London Golf Show, it is aimed at increasing the marketing, selling and enjoyment of golf holidays both at home and abroad, and was highly appreciated by the destinations present last year. With its own stage for presentations the Golf Tourism Show provides an unmatched forum for destinations and resorts to promote from, and to talk to golfers face to face.\nThe organisers also invite all who work within the golf industry to attend for free, so exhibitors will benefit from a large trade presence, and the huge networking and business opportunities that presents.\nBluewater attracts 28 million visitors every year and its easy access by car, combined with free parking and regular trains to and from central London provides exhibitors and visitors with a convenient and quick route into the venue and the show. Visitors to The London Golf Show 2015 will also be able to enjoy Glow’s unparalleled choice of refreshments with over 55 of Bluewater’s bars, cafes and restaurants all in close proximity to the venue, and its own dedicated dining Plaza right outside.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:12:01.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
