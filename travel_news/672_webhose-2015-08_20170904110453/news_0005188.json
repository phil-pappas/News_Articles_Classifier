The bad news is threefold: 1) Wow Air only currently serves Boston (BOS) and Washington, D.C./Baltimore (BWI); the return rates are higher, though not enough to thwart a cost-conscious traveler; and the various ancillary fees will get you, though not enough to nullify any airfare savings. Check out the extremely affordable rates we found on Wow Air, peppered throughout various days this fall, mostly during October - January: Boston, MA to Amsterdam, Netherlands for $99 O/W Washington, D.C., to Amsterdam, Netherlands for $99 O/W Boston, MA to Paris, France for $99 O/W Washington, D.C., to Paris, France for $99 O/W Boston, MA to Dublin, Ireland for $99 O/W Washington, D.C., to Reykjavik, Iceland for $186 O/W Boston, MA to Reykjavik, Iceland for $194 O/W Washington, D.C., to London, England for $199 O/W Washington, D.C., to Berlin, Germany for $206 O/W Boston, MA to London, England for $212 O/W Boston, MA to to Copenhagen, Denmark for $242 O/W Find Cheap Flights!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:47:45.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
