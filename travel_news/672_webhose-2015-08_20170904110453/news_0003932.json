Bunny Jolly, a company specializing in family travel products, recently announced they are now offering a full two year no-hassle warranty on their FlightJoy Car Seat Travel Bag available on Amazon.com.\n\nWhile many brands claim to be believers in the products they sell, a quick look at the warranties they offer seem to indicate otherwise. On the other hand, there are still a few companies http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnvGAQLqzGA who break from this trend and go above and beyond to be sure their customers are both satisfied and protected. Enter Bunny Jolly and their very popular first product the FlightJoy Car Seat Travel Bag, designed to make traveling with a car seat on a plane or nearly anywhere else as simple as possible. The company recently announced they are now offering a full two year no-hassle warranty on every car seat bag sold, well above and beyond the industry standard for this kind of product of 30 days.\n\n\"We know when people shop for a product from a new brand, they take a good look at the warranty,\" commented a spokesperson from Bunny Jolly. \"To give them added peace of mind, we decided we would raise our warranty all the way to two years, which is really unheard of for this kind of product. We want people to know they can count on the quality of our FlightJoy Car Seat Travel Bag and on our backing the product up should they find an issue, which is very unlikely.\"\n\nAccording to the company, the FlightJoy Car Seat Travel Bag has been designed of high quality material especially to be rugged and able to protect a car seat from damage well. The durable nylon material is rugged and water-resistant, and the straps are attached to the bag very strongly to make sure they don't rip or tear. All of this adds to the confidence Bunny Jolly expresses when they offer their extended two year warranty.\n\nShoppers looking for FlightJoy Car Seat Travel bag can purchase it directly from Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/Travel-FlightJoy-Durable-LightWeight-Resistant/dp/B00Y8LYYR2.\n\nMore details about the product warranty can be found on http://www.bunnyjolly.com.\n\nAbout Bunny Jolly\n\nBunny Jolly family owns business.
