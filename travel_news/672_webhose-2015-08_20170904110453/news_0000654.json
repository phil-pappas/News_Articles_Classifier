Metro Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said Thursday that the attacker made a gash on the canister of propane, rending it useless.\nAaron said Vincente David Montano started his attack by pepper-spraying two women who were sitting in the theater. A man who was with them intervened and he was wounded by an ax that Montano was carrying. Montano also had a pellet gun. He was killed by police.\n___\nA police officer leaves the lobby of a movie theater complex Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in Antioch, Tenn., where an investigation continues after police respond to an attacker Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) 10 a.m.\nPolice reports from 2004 show that the man who attacked moviegoers in a Tennessee theater had a long history of mental problems, with his mother telling officers in one case that he heard voices telling him to do things.\nVincente Montano's mother called police for help at least twice in 2004. In February of that year, Denise Pruett told officers he was destructive and broke a coffee table and jewelry box. Police took Montano to a mental hospital for an evaluation, though the results of that are unclear.\nA police officer leaves the lobby of a movie theater complex Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in Antioch, Tenn., where an investigation continues after police respond to an attacker Wednesday.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) In September of that year, police returned after the mother and son had an argument over him not mowing the lawn. It was decided that Montano would fly to Chicago because of his mental problems, but he was arrested when an officer tried to take a plastic fork away from him.\n___\n7:50 a.m.\nJust two days before an attack at a Nashville-area movie theater, the mother of the man police say is responsible told police he was missing.\nAccording to a missing persons report, Denise Pruett, the mother of 29-year-old Vincente David Montano, contacted police in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, on Monday. She told them her son was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in April 2006.\nThe report says she said she had not seen him since March 2013. The report also says that in May 2015, authorities in Texas contacted her and said she needed to file a missing persons report in Murfreesboro. But it does not specify why Texas authorities were concerned he was missing or believed he was in Tennessee.\nThe Murfreesboro report says Pruett brought with her a copy of a Tennessee identification card for Montano that listed an address for Nashville Rescue a homeless shelter. The report lists his address as \"homeless\" and says he \"has a hard time taking care of himself.\"\nAttempts to reach Pruett through phone numbers listed for her and other messages have been unsuccessful.\n___\n3:37 a.m.\nWhat initially appeared to be another mass shooting at a movie theater is beginning to look more like the last desperate act of a severely disturbed homeless man who may have had no intention of harming large numbers of people â€” but perhaps knew he himself could be killed.\nPolice say the 29-year-old man identified as Vincente David Montano bought a ticket for \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" in southern Nashville and entered with pepper spray, a pellet gun and an ax. He fired the pepper spray at several people in the audience before a police officer summoned by other theatergoers confronted him. Montano was shot dead by a SWAT team as he tried to escape out of a back door.\nMetro Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron says Montano had been treated at least four times for psychiatric issues.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/06/2d/e0/b7e55513fa6d4c18965a88ec35b9ebb9-7440289abaf84c3998664b1e224c9843-0.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/05/ab/74/theatershooter.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/06/32/52/b7e55513fa6d4c18965a88ec35b9ebb9-7440289abaf84c3998664b1e224c9843-9.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-06T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:34:04.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
