Translated as \"the southern capital\", it is the only one of the four located on the south side of the Yangtze, the great river that marks the boundary between the northern and southern parts of the vast country. \nSun Yat-sen is highly revered by the citizens of both the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan). The first country sees him as the “forerunner of democratic revolution” and the latter regards him as the “Father Of The Nation”. Each year, his mausoleum in Nanjing’s Purple Mountain is visited by millions, many of whom come not just to enjoy sightseeing but to pay respect to the great man. \nNanjing, known by different names during different periods of the past, became the capital in 229AD during the period of the Three Kingdoms, which encompassed six decades of bloody turmoil. This was during a time when three major states battled for supremacy following the fall of the Han dynasty which had ruled a unified Chinese empire for over 400 years. Known back then as Jianye, the city was the capital of Eastern Wu, one of the three warring states. Sun Quan, the first emperor of Eastern Wu, was buried in Zijin Shan (Purple Mountain in English, although a more accurate translation is Purple-Gold Mountain) which stands on the eastern side of the present-day Nanjing city. \nOver the course of more than a thousand years after the period of the Three Kingdoms, China has seen various dynasties come and go. Like that of Eastern Wu, several later empires chose Nanjing as their capital. Among them was the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). \nHongwu, the first Ming emperor, made Nanjing the centre of his new empire. Like Sun Quan, his mausoleum was also built in the Purple Mountain. A few years after Hongwu's death, the new Ming emperor moved the capital to Beijing (translated as \"the northern capital\"). \nThe lady climbing up the stairs on crutches was obviously not disheartened by the number of steps it would take her to reach the mausoleum. \nThe Ming was later replaced by China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644-1912) which continued to use Beijing as its power base. As fate would have it, after over two millennia since the first imperial dynasty of the Qin (221-206BC) — which preceded the Han and the period of the Three Kingdoms — China eventually entered a new phase of history. Nanjing, again, regained its prestigious status. In 1912 it was selected as the capital of the newly established Republic of China led by Dr Sun Yat-sen. \nSun died in Beijing in 1925. Four years later his remains were brought to Nanjing and placed in a mausoleum built for him on the Purple Mountain where he had wanted his final resting place to be. \nIn 1949, the \"southern capital\" later lost its title to its northern counterpart once again when the Mao Zedong-led People's Liberation Army won the civil war and proclaimed Beijing the capital of the People's Republic of China. \nDue to its political importance, Nanjing has been repeatedly looted and ravaged in numerous revolts and wars, both between the Chinese and against foreign invaders. As a result, not much of the architectural heritage from ancient times remain, except the renovated city wall, one of the longest in the world, and what is left of the grand tomb of Hongwu, the first emperor of Ming dynasty. Nonetheless, the Purple Mountain, the Xuanwu lake next to it and the vibrant yet surprisingly not-so-chaotic city itself — rich in interesting places that will give you a better understanding of China's complex history and its modern-day people — definitely make the city well worth a visit. \nThis section of the Spirit Way which leads to the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, the final resting place of the first Ming emperor Hongwu, is lined with lush trees and sculptures of animals both real and mythical, each carrying a special meaning. Camels, for example, represent trade, while elephants and horses are symbols for politics and war, respectively. The imperial tomb, remnants of which were looted during the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864), is located on the Purple Mountain not far from Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. \nThe Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge was constructed between 1960 and 1968, a tough time marked by the relationship between China and its fellow communist neighbour, the Soviet Union, turning sour. The bridge has two storeys, the upper for cars and other road vehicles and the lower one for trains. It is the third bridge built across the mighty Yangtze, after the ones in Wuhan and Chongqing, but the first that China built without foreign aid using its own technology and resources. No wonder President Mao and the entire nation were very proud of this milestone achievement. From the bridge, which is always one of the must-see sites for Chinese visiting Nanjing, you can enjoy a good view of the river as well as the city from both sides. \nNanjing’s history is filled with bloody events, the worst of which being the six weeks that started from Dec 13, 1937. This was the day Nanjing, the then capital of the Republic of China, fell to Japanese forces. Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Yat-sen’s successor, was forced to move his government further west to Wuhan and again to Chongqing. Known worldwide as the Nanjing Massacre, it is estimated that 300,000 people, many of them children, were murdered and raped during the incident. Details of this ugly part of history, as well as its causes and consequences, are recorded at the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Museum so that it will never be forgotten by later generations. \nNanjing serves as a good springboard for exploring the Lower Yangtze River Basin. Wuzhen, a historic water town in the adjacent Zhejiang province, is definitely a place to put on your itinerary. Spend a night there so that you can appreciate the old town when it is free of other tourists. \nFuzimiao is one of Nanjing’s most popular districts for visitors. This area surrounding the city’s Confucius temple, one of the best-known in China, boasts numerous shops and restaurants that line the pedestrian-filled streets. Just a stone’s throw from the entrance of the temple is the Qin Huai river, a tributary to the Yangtze, where there are electric-powered tour boats to take you along the Qin Huai river. The queue is usually very long for the 40-minute cruise, especially in the evening when bridges and other spots along the waterway are lit. If you don’t have much time to waste (there is not much to see and the commentary is in Chinese) but still want to ride something, try one of the rickshaws. However, the best way to explore Fuzimiao is by foot. \nThis beamless hall, a rare survivor from the times of the Ming dynasty, is part of the Linggu Temple complex where Chinese people come to pay respect to those who sacrificed their lives fighting against the Japanese forces which invaded and destroyed Nanjing during the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The temple is located at the foot of the Purple Mountain, east of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. \nTraditionally, the food in Nanjing is considered to not be as tasty as the food from areas further south such as Hong Kong. Nonetheless, be open-minded and ready to try new things and you'll enjoy the culinary experience here. As a matter of fact, these days there are so many modern restaurants in the city you will find something to satisfy your taste buds. Service is usually efficient and in some places, surprisingly friendly. \nIn Nanjing, people are in general very well behaved, despite the fact that many of them are tourists from other parts of the country. It is common to see people queuing up to buy things or do things. Passers-by wait until you finish taking photos to walk past. The streets and public toilets in the tourist areas of Nanjing are usually very clean and well maintained.
