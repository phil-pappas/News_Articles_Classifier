The manager of Atlantic City's tram service is blaming city officials for financial troubles, saying he was led to believe they would soon pass ordinances to allow for an increase in ride charges and the ability to advertise on the cars.

Tim Boland , manager of the trams for B&B Parking, t old The Press of Atlantic City , the $126,000 winning bid on the tram contract was so much higher than competitors in 2014 because of discussions with city officials on the ordinances. Before his bid was in, Boland said, he had conversations with city officials leading him to believe those changes wouldn’t be controversial. As evidence, he produced a document he authored recommending such ordinance alterations. He said he sent it to the city early in the year, following meetings with administration staffers. “I think they led everybody to believe the pricing wasn’t set in stone,” Boland said. Since the spring, multiple new tram ordinances have come before council, offering price limits as high as $5 for a one-way ride and $12 for an all-day pass. However, none have become law. City officials deny the suggestion that they told Boland the ordinance changes were inevitable. \nGet Philadelphia Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:33:36.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
