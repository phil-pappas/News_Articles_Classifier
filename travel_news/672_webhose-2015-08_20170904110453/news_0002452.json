That’s because nobody expects a break, nobody expects better news. For some months there has been a parade of big breaches - from Target to HomeDepot to United Air to Anthem to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management - and the stark reality is that experts anticipate matters will only get worse. “It is safe to say the Data Breach Era will continue for the foreseeable future because too many organizations do not maintain even basic cyber security hygiene, let alone have the skills and resources to cope with the rapid pace of evolving threats,” said Elad Yoran, executive chairman of security company KoolSpan.

Along the way, big federal government agencies were targeted, and hackers made off with millions of files, including some gathered in security clearance background checks. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T21:57:57.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
