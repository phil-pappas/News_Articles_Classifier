(NYSE: TEU) (the \"Company\"), a global shipping company specializing in the seaborne transportation of containers, announced today its results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015 .\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\nFinancial Highlights\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share data)\n2014\n2015\n2014\n2015\nTime charter revenues\n$12,878\n$11,600\n$27,381\n$23,169\nAmortization of above/below market time charters\n1,501\n966\n2,442\n2,249\nTime charter revenues, adjusted 1\n$14,379\n$12,566\n$29,823\n$25,418\nNet Income / (Loss)\n$675\n($1,385)\n($844)\n($1,669)\nAdjusted Net Income 2\n$2,334\n$0\n$2,636\n$1,542\nEBITDA 2\n$6,228\n$3,761\n$10,350\n$8,639\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$7,887\n$5,146\n$13,830\n$11,850\nEarnings / (Loss) per common share (EPS), basic and diluted\n$0.01\n($0.06)\n($0.07)\n($0.09)\nAdjusted Earnings / (Loss) per common share, basic and diluted 2\n$0.06\n($0.02)\n$0.06\n$0.02\n1\nTime charter revenues, adjusted, is not a recognized measurement under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). We believe that the presentation of Time charter revenues, adjusted is useful to investors because it presents the charter revenues recognized in the relevant period based on the contracted charter rates, excluding the amortization of above/below market time charters attached to vessels acquired. Please refer to the definition and reconciliation of this measurement to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the back of this release.\n2\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) per common share (\"Adjusted EPS\") are not recognized measurements under GAAP. Please refer to the definitions and reconciliation of these measurements to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the back of this release.\nMr. Michael Bodouroglou , Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of Box Ships Inc., commented:\n\"During the second quarter of 2015, we reported net loss of $1.4 million mainly due to the dry-dockings of Box Hong Kong and Box China . Although these dry-dockings were due later in 2015, we decided to undergo the dry-dockings immediately after the redelivery of the vessels from their previous charter, which has enabled us to successfully re-charter the vessels to MSC for a period of twelve to sixteen months uninterruptedly.\nIn addition, as previously announced, in June 2015 we extended the loan facility that is secured by the vessels Box Hong Kong and Box China , which reduces the vessels' break-even levels and demonstrates the support of our lenders.\nFinally, we fixed the Box Trader at a gross daily rate of $12,400 on a short-term period and extended the CMA CGM Kingfish for a period of five to eight months at a gross daily rate of $15,500 , increased by 46% and 63%, respectively, compared to their previous charters, which illustrates the continued market improvement.\"\nResults of Operations\nThree months ended June 30, 2015 compared to three months ended June 30, 2014\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we operated an average of 9 vessels. Our Net Loss during the second quarter of 2015 was $1.4 million , whereas our Adjusted Net Income during the quarter was nil, resulting in basic and diluted loss per share of $0.06 and basic and diluted adjusted loss per share of $0.02 . EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 were $3.8 million and $5.1 million , respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2014, we operated an average of 9 vessels. Our Net Income and Adjusted Net Income during the second quarter of 2014 was $0.7 million and $2.3 million , respectively, resulting in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 and basic and diluted adjusted earnings per share of $0.06 . EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2014 was $6.2 million and $7.9 million , respectively.\nNet revenues\nNet revenues represent charter hire earned, net of commissions. During the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, our vessels operated a total of 740 and 819 days, respectively, out of a total of 819 calendar days in both periods. During the second quarter of 2015, we had a total of 20 unscheduled off-hire days, mainly related to 19 idle days of Box Queen , and 59 scheduled off-hire days related to the dry-dockings of Box Hong Kong and Box China . Currently, all vessels in our fleet are employed under fixed rate time charters, having an average weighted remaining charter duration of 6 months (weighted by aggregate contracted charter hire). The Company reported net revenues for the second quarter of 2015 of $11.2 million , a decrease of 10% compared to $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease is mainly due to the re-chartering of Box Emma in March 2015 at a daily rate of $13,500 , compared to the daily rate of $28,500 the vessel was earning during the second quarter of 2014, the redelivery of Box Hong Kong and Box China from their charterer on May 26, 2015 and June 6, 2015 , respectively, the scheduled off-hire days related to the dry-dockings of Box Hong Kong and Box China and the idle days of Box Queen during the second quarter of 2015. The decrease in revenues resulting from the lower rate and the increase in off-hire days was partially offset by the higher re-chartering rates of other vessels. More specifically, during the second quarter of 2015, the Box Voyager earned a daily rate of $10,600 , compared to $7,350 per day that the vessel was earning during the second quarter of 2014; the Box Trader earned a daily rate of $8,500 , compared to $8,000 per day that the vessel was earning during the second quarter of 2014; each of the CMA CGM Kingfish and CMA CGM Marlin earned a daily rate of $9,500 , compared to $7,000 per day that each of these vessels was earning during the second quarter of 2014; and the Box Queen earned an average daily rate of approximately $13,115 , compared to $6,100 per day that the vessel was earning during the second quarter of 2014.\nOur net revenues are also net of the amortization of above/below market time charters, which decreased our revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 by $1.0 million and $1.5 million , respectively, or $0.03 and $0.05 per common share, respectively. Our average time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, for the second quarter of 2015 was $14,697 per vessel per day, which was 2% below our average TCE rate of $15,010 per vessel per day during the second quarter of 2014, mainly due to the reasons outlined above. Our adjusted TCE rate was $16,002 per vessel per day in the second quarter of 2015, 5% lower than our adjusted TCE of $16,843 for the second quarter of 2014. TCE rate is not a recognized measurement under GAAP. Please see the table at the back of this release for a reconciliation of TCE rates to time charter revenues, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 amounted to $0.3 million and $0.2 million , respectively. Voyage expenses for the second quarter of 2015 primarily relate to bunkers consumed by the Box Hong Kong and Box China travelling to and from the dry-dockings of $0.2 million and war risk insurance costs of $0.1 million , whereas voyage expenses for the second quarter of 2014 related mainly to war risk insurance costs.\nVessels operating expenses\nVessels operating expenses including the amortization of other intangible assets for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 amounted to $4.0 million and $4.5 million , respectively, or $3.8 million and $4.2 million , respectively, on an adjusted basis to exclude the amortization of other intangible assets. On average, our vessels' operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 amounted to $4,938 per vessel per day, or $4,683 per vessel per day on an adjusted basis, compared to $5,444 per vessel per day, in the second quarter of 2014, or $5,123 per vessel per day on an adjusted basis. The decrease is a result of continuing cost control efforts. The amortization of other intangible assets for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 amounted to $0.2 million and $0.3 million , respectively.\nDry-docking expenses\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, two of our vessels, the Box Hong Kong and the Box China , underwent their dry-dockings, which resulted in 59 off-hire days and expenses amounting to $1.3 million . There were no dry-dockings in the second quarter of 2014.\nManagement fees charged by a related party\nManagement fees charged by Allseas Marine S.A. (our \"Manager\" or \"Allseas\") for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 were $0.6 million and $0.7 million , or $718 (€648.93) per vessel per day, and $886 (€646.99) per vessel per day, respectively. Management fees charged by a related party represent fees for management and technical services in accordance with our management agreements and are adjusted annually in accordance with the official Eurozone inflation rate. This fee is charged on a daily basis per vessel and is affected by the number of vessels in our fleet, the number of calendar days during the period, the official Eurozone inflation rate and the U.S. Dollar/Euro exchange rate at the beginning of each month.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation for our fleet for each of the second quarters of 2015 and 2014 was $3.8 million .\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 amounted to $1.1 million and $1.5 million , or $1,353 and $1,870 per vessel per day, respectively. The decrease in G&A expenses is mainly due to the decreased share-based compensation, which amounted to $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $0.5 million in the same period of 2014.\nInterest and finance costs\nInterest and finance costs amounted to $1.4 million and $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. This decrease in interest and finance costs is due to the decrease in our average borrowings outstanding period over period.\nUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2014\n2015\nNet cash from Operating Activities\n$\n9,284\n$\n7,332\nNet cash used in Financing Activities\n(1,884)\n(7,412)\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n7,400\n$\n(80)\nNet cash from Operating Activities\nNet cash from Operating Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $7.3 million . Our vessels generated positive cash flows from revenues, net of commissions, of $23.3 million , while we paid $16.0 million for expenses, of which $2.6 million relates to the payment of interest on our bank loans.\nNet cash from Operating Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $9.3 million . Our vessels generated positive cash flows from revenues, net of commissions, of $29.8 million , while we paid $20.5 million for expenses, of which $3.1 million relates to the payment of interest on our bank loans.\nNet cash used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in Financing Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , was $7.4 million . During the six months ended June 30, 2015 , we repaid $6.4 million of our debt and made cash payments to our preferred shareholders of $1.0 million .\nNet cash used in Financing Activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 , was $1.9 million . On April 15, 2014 , we completed the public offering and concurrent private placement of 5,500,000 Units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to purchase 0.40 common shares (the \"Units\") at a public offering price of $2.05 per unit, resulting in net proceeds of $10.6 million in the aggregate, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs of $0.7 million in the aggregate. During the six months ended June 30, 2014 , we repaid $11.4 million of our debt, paid financing costs of $0.1 million and made cash payments to our preferred shareholders of $1.0 million .\nLiquidity:\nAs of June 30, 2015 , our cash and restricted cash (current and non-current) amounted to $14.5 million in aggregate, of which $8.0 million is considered restricted for minimum liquidity purposes under our loan agreements. As of June 30, 2015 , we had total outstanding indebtedness of $128.6 million , of which $12.1 million is scheduled to be repaid in the forthcoming 12-month period, of which $3.2 million has been repaid as of the date of this release. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2015 , we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our loan agreements, as amended to give effect to waivers that we were granted during 2014 and 2015. As of June 30, 2015 , had the waivers not been granted, we would not have been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants and security cover ratios contained in the loan agreements. The waivers are due to expire on June 29, 2016 , and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, unless the waivers are extended for a period of more than one year after the balance sheet date or the loans are refinanced prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements, our total debt will be required to be presented as current even though we were in compliance as of June 30, 2015 .\nFinally, we have no borrowing capacity under our existing loan facilities and no capital commitments. We anticipate that our current financial resources, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the operations of our current fleet, including our working capital requirements, for the next 12 months, assuming that the debt will not be accelerated by our lenders.\nPreferred Stock Payments:\nOn July 1, 2015 , we made a cash payment of $0.5 million with respect to our Series C Preferred Shares, for the period from April 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015 . As of June 30, 2015 , 916,333 Series C Preferred Shares were outstanding.\nCash payments on our Series C Preferred Shares accrue cumulatively at a rate of 9.00% per annum per $25.00 stated liquidation preference per Series C Preferred Share and are payable, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, on January 1 , April 1 , July 1 and October 1 of each year. Our ability to make cash payments will be subject, among other things, to the restrictions in our loan agreements, the provisions of Marshall Islands law and other factors to be considered by our Board of Directors.\nChartering Update and Strategy:\nIn July 2015 , the Box Trader entered into a time charter with Zim Integrated Shipping Services Ltd. (\"ZIM\") for a period of 50 to 115 days, which commenced on August 3, 2015 , at a daily gross charter rate of $12,400 .\nIn July 2015 , the CMA CGM Kingfish extended its time charter with CMA CGM for a further period until January 2016 to April 2016 , which commenced on August 15, 2015 , at a daily gross charter rate of $15,500 .\nPursuant to our chartering strategy, we focus on short- to medium-term time charters with staggered maturities, which provide us with the benefit of stable cash flows from a diversified portfolio of charterers, while preserving the flexibility to capitalize on potentially rising rates when the current time charters expire. We may also, under certain circumstances, opportunistically employ our vessels on the spot market. Based on the earliest redelivery dates, the Company has secured under time charter contracts 76% and 18% of its fleet capacity for the remainder of 2015 and 2016, respectively.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.\nThe Company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation.

Any idle days relating to the days a vessel remains unemployed are included in unscheduled off-hire days.\n(4)\nFleet utilization is the percentage of time that our vessels were able to generate revenues and is determined by dividing operating days by fleet calendar days for the relevant period.\n(5)\nTime charter equivalent (\"TCE\"), is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE is determined by dividing time charter revenues, net of commissions and voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of extra war risk insurance, port, canal, fuel costs and other crew costs reimbursable by the charterers that are unique to a particular voyage and bunkers consumed during the periods that vessels are in between employment. TCE is a non-GAAP standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot voyage charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods.\n(6)\nDaily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, other than extra war risk insurance, maintenance, repairs and amortization of intangibles, is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(7)\nDaily management fees are calculated by dividing management fees charged by a related party by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(8)\nDaily general and administrative expenses are calculated by dividing general and administrative expense by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(9)\nTotal vessel operating expenses (\"TVOE\") are a measurement of our total expenses, excluding dry-docking expenses, associated with operating our vessels. TVOE is the sum of vessel operating expenses, management fees and general and administrative expenses. Daily TVOE is calculated by dividing TVOE by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP measures\nTime Charter Equivalent Reconciliation\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except days and daily results)\nThree Months Ended June 30,\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2014\n2015\n2014\n2015\nTime Charter Revenues\n$12,878\n$11,600\n$27,381\n$23,169\nCommissions\n(350)\n(377)\n(663)\n(697)\nVoyage Expenses\n(234)\n(347)\n(732)\n(941)\nTotal Revenue, net of voyage expenses\n$12,294\n$10,876\n$25,986\n$21,531\nPlus: Amortization of above/below market time charters\n1,501\n966\n2,442\n2,249\nTotal Revenue, net of voyage expenses, adjusted\n$13,795\n$11,842\n$28,428\n$23,780\nTotal operating days\n819\n740\n1,572\n1,517\nTime Charter Equivalent\n$15,010\n$14,697\n$16,530\n$14,193\nTime Charter Equivalent, adjusted (10)\n$16,843\n$16,002\n$18,084\n$15,676\n(10)\nTime charter equivalent, adjusted (\"TCE adjusted\"), is a non-GAAP measure and is determined by dividing time charter revenues, net of commissions, voyage expenses and amortization of above/below market time charters attached to the vessels acquired, by operating days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of extra war risk insurance, port, canal, fuel costs and other crew costs reimbursable by the charterers that are unique to a particular voyage. We believe that the presentation of TCE adjusted is useful to investors because it presents the TCE earned in the relevant period based on the contracted charter rates, excluding the amortization of above/below market time charters attached to the vessels acquired.

The Company's management uses EBITDA as a performance measure. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because the shipping industry is capital intensive and may involve significant financing costs. The Company excluded non-cash items in relation to the amortization of intangibles, share-based compensation and unrealized gain / loss on derivatives to derive Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes it provides additional information on the fleet operational results which may be useful to investors.\nThe Company excluded non-cash items in relation to the amortization of intangibles, share-based compensation and unrealized gain / loss on derivatives from net income / (loss) to derive to Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted EPS / (Loss) per share. The Company believes that Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted EPS / (Loss) per share provide additional information on the fleet operational results which may be useful to investors.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted EPS / (Loss) per share are items not recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income / (loss), operating income / (loss), earnings / (loss) per share or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP.
