And it is not just the large aquarium which draws marine-lovers to the hotel. \nUnder the AquaDom are many other water attractions including a walk-through underwater tunnel and an interactive rockpool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T03:20:04.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
