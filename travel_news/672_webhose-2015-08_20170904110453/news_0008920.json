Paris guillotine\nThe Prison de la Roquette sat on this now non-remarkable Parisian street from 1830-1899. While the building was destroyed more than 100 years ago, there are still five indents left on the street. At first glance they seem like simple street repairs, but they are actually the stones on which the guillotine was erected, and the place where 69 people were beheaded in public . Unless you already knew about it, you would have no idea of the gruesome historical significance this spot holds.\nBlink and you could miss it. Source: Supplied\n2. Tombstones\nSadly, during WWII and for years afterwards, Jewish tombstones (or matzevots) were taken by the Nazis and used to pave streets and repair walls in Poland. A non-profit group the Matzeva Project has been campaigning to restore approximately one million gravestones that remain hidden around the country\nAccording to its website: “The project will uncover matzevas and find Jewish stories often hidden in structures of towns and villages, they will be brought to light ... The majority of the 1200 old Jewish cemeteries in Poland have been destroyed, neglected and forgot. However beneath the rubble of memory, often times, old matzevas, tombstones still exist.”\nIt has already has success with Warsaw agreeing to return 1000 of the misused tombstones that had been used in the construction of a city park, including steps and a pergola.\nPart of a tombstone from a Jewish cemetery used to pave a road.

They may seen out of place, but these markings are called a punto de reunion , or meeting point. Each circle marks a predesignated evacuation point for a nearby building and are part of the background scenery of Mexican streetscapes.\nWalking into a mystery?

Nobody really knows what the cryptic message is about, but as reported by MentalFloss , they usually contain most of this message:\n“TOYNBEE IDEA\n“IN KUBRICK’S 2001\n“RESURRECT DEAD\n“ON PLANET JUPITER”\nIt’s believed the “2001” is a reference to Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey which detailed a trip to Jupiter. There's debate whether “Toynbee” is a reference to British historian Arnold Toynbee, or the short story The Toynbee Convector by Ray Bradbury.\nConspiracy theories are rife, even leading to an investigative documentary in 2011 . But the mystery remains, with new tiles popping up in recent years, including some from copycats.\nThe mysterious tile. Picture: Paul Stableman Source: Flickr\n5. A n M-blem\nThis “M-blem” is the name of the “M” shaped logo of Transport for Greater Manchester, which was introduced in 1974. It is sprayed in some locations around the city — this one was spotted outside the Newhey Metrolink station, marking an important spot for the public transport network.\n“M” marks the spot.

The Hess Triangle\nThis mosaic triangle with a rather aggressive message can be found at the intersection of 7th Avenue and Christopher Street in Manhattan. It’s from the 1910s, where a land battle left the owner David Hess with just this triangle of his property after New York City seized it to expand the underground train network. Hence the angry message!\nThe Hess Triangle.
