These solutions include SiteMinder’s Internet booking engine, TheBookingButton, which, alone, generated over US$650 million for hotels via their own SiteMinder’s co-founder and managing director, Mike Ford, says these numbers show increasing recognition that best-of-breed hotel technology is crucial to attracting, reaching and converting the modern-day traveller.\n“For a hotelier, the Internet economy is demanding more than ever before – with the continual emergence of new, alternative sales avenues such as TripConnect instant booking and the rapid speed at which today’s travellers make their hotel bookings online through their own booking engine or through mobile apps like Roomlia,” says Mr Ford.\n“Cloud technology such as SiteMinder’s, which meets these demands, empowers hoteliers to have greater control of the web as well as significantly lower costs of guest acquisition which they otherwise would not have. The web presents infinite opportunities to attract today’s traveller – both directly and using third-party sites – but it’s about making sure you have the broadest reach possible, the strongest of system integrations, the most reliable of channel connections and the most secure of data. This is what SiteMinder offers to hotels.\nSource:-SiteMinder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:18:33.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
