It promises to be yet another great evening of feel-good music featuring Indonesian stars, Citra Scholastika and Bastian Steel. \nKnown for her distinctive jazzy vocal, Citra Scholastika was the youngest finalist to compete in Indonesian Idol Season Six. She started singing from an early age and gained stage confidence by participating in church talent contents. Citra has since risen to fame with a string of hits including the popular Everybody Knew, which top the chart for many weeks in Indonesia. Her soulful cover of the classic song, Somewhere Over the Rainbow widened her appeal to mature audiences. \nWith his curly hair and cheeky personality, 15 year old Bastian Steel continues to wow fans as a singer, presenter and actor. Before embarking on a solo career, the multi-talented teen was a member of leading Indonesian boy band, Coboy Junior. Bastian has appeared at events across Asia and his fun singing style includes pop, hip hop and reggae. \nBoth artists will take to the stage for an uplifting concert that is expected to appeal to music lovers of ages. It will commence at 7pm with a succession of solo performances by Citra and Bastian. There will also be a heartfelt collaboration with children choir from Bali’s leading music school. \nTickets for this annual charity event are priced at just IDR 150,000 per person. All proceeds will be donated directly to UNICEF for a project that provides educational opportunities and vaccinates children across the Asia Pacific region. \nFor the past 20 years Starwood Hotels and Resorts has partnered with UNICEF to raise funds for a number of worthy causes that benefit impoverished children around the world. In the Asia Pacific region alone, the UNICEF Check Out For Children Program has supported the immunization of thousands of young women and children against a number of preventable diseases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:59:23.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
