Jason Phythian said he had a canister emptied over him.

He threw it over me and got out a cigarette lighter. I jumped up, not knowing what on Earth was going on. It was disgusting to try and make light of Tunisia in that way.”\nMr Sutton said his family ran for their lives.\n“I joined the crowd of British people who rushed down to the hotel manager to complain,” he said.\nRemembering the attack ...

Picture: Twitter Source: Twitter\nA spokeswoman at the hotel said: “We are sorry and have apologised to our tour operators in the UK.”\nTour company Jet2holidays apologised for any distress caused and said the hotel’s entertainment team had assured them they would never use the Arab costumes again.\n“The hotel management have assured us it was never their intention to cause any offence or upset with their entertainment program,” she said. “This was a Hollywood-themed poolside show, which included the characters Rambo and Superman, and is always well received by the hotel’s residents. The management now understands some of the costumes may have caused offence and will no longer use these in their shows.”\nThe mock attack comes as Australian tourists were evacuated from a resort in Vanauatu after a terrifying arson attack.\nThe 21 holiday-makers were forced to flee their accommodation on the island of Tanna after petrol bombs were hurled and vehicles set alight.\nOne Australian woman — who local media said was in Vanuautu to help with the Cyclone Pam recovery effort — reportedly suffered facial injuries after she was hit with rocks and stones.\nThe owner of the resort told Radio New Zealand a group of youths had been harassing him for months and had caused over $US2 million worth of damage is a series of arson attacks after he refused to give them money.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/6586788/Hotel-staff-in-sick-mock-IS-attack-stunt.html", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Mock+attack+not+funny+for+tourists&c=HOLIDAYMAKERS+at+a+luxury+hotel+ran+for+their+lives+after+hotel+staff+dressed+as+mock+terrorists+in+a+%26%238220%3Bjoke%26%238221%3B+attack+just+months+after+the+Tunisia+massacre.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5&title=Mock+attack+not+funny+for+tourists", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5&title=Mock+attack+not+funny+for+tourists", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/turkey-hotel-grand-yazici-mares-hotel-in-icmeler-staged-mock-terrorist-attack-six-weeks-after-tunisia-massacre/story-e6frfq80-1227482824543?sv=b0bb1af63ad539444e812b19f7d62ee5&h=Mock+attack+not+funny+for+tourists"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T01:32:19.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
