But not just dancing -- also drinking. While it may be totally illegal to drink in the streets of your hometown, here's four booze-friendly places where you can drink outside. Because when the sun is shining, no one wants to imbibe in a dimly lit bar.\n\nCP\nCP\nLas Vegas, Nev.\nIt will surprise approximately no one that Las Vegas allows drinking outside, in both downtown (part of the City of Las Vegas) and the Strip (part of Clark County). On the Strip, just avoid glass containers and closed containers -- for example, a six-pack of beer can't legally be consumed within 300 metres of where they were purchased. Many bars in Vegas offer ginormous \"yard-long\" drinks in souvenir cups that tourists wander around with outside (you'll likely see plenty of people doing this along the Strip).\nWhat to Drink: The yard-long drinks at any of the Fat Tuesday locations are always a popular choice for serious partiers.\nWhere to Stay: Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, The Palms Casino Resort or any of the many party hotels found throughout Las Vegas.\n\nNew Orleans, La.\nNew Orleans is also notorious for its outdoor booze fests -- as long as your drink is not in a breakable container, you're good to go. If you're celebrating something, you can even star in your own Second Line parade behind a brass band, as long as you pay the necessary permit fees and police escort fees.\nWhat to Drink: A Sazerac cognac cocktail, invented in New Orleans and considered by many to be America's oldest cocktail, or a hurricane, a popular New Orleans fruity rum drink.\nWhere to Stay: The party-friendly Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel or any hotels in the French Quarter, the heart of New Orleans' party action.\n\nBeale Street, Memphis, Tenn.\nBeale Street may be known for its rich blues history, but it's also known for being the only place in Tennessee where you can legally drink in the street.\nWhat to Drink: No trip to Beale Street would be complete without trying a Silky's Diver, which is served in a big yellow bucket. Though the recipe is allegedly a secret, the concoction is purported to contain some combination of rum, grenadine, and beer, and something called a \"Mysterious Zig Zig,\" according to an episode of Drinking Made Easy.\nWhere to Stay: The upscale Westin Memphis Beale Street, with a terrific location that's within walking distance to all the Beale Street action.\n\nHistoric District, Savannah, Ga.\nAs long as your drink is in an open plastic container and 500 millilitres or less, it's legal in Savannah's Historic District, where many bars offer to-go cups. Only one drink per person outside, though, so don't try to skirt the rule by double fisting!\nWhat to Drink: A traditional Southern cocktail such as an Old-Fashioned.\nWhere to Stay: Holiday Inn Express Savannah-Historic District or any hotels in Savannah's Historic District -- especially ones close to River Street, a major artery for tourist.\n\n--Tribune Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T13:05:38.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
