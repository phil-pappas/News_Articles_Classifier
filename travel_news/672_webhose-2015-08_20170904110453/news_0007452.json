Comment The Rolla Daily News - Rolla, MO By Tom Uhlenbrock Posted Aug. 21, 2015 at 5:38 PM By Tom Uhlenbrock Posted Aug. 21, 2015 at 5:38 PM EMINENCE, Mo. The development of the state park system’s property in Shannon County will add a new lodge, cabins and campground to the state park system but will open up for exploration a much larger landscape of the Missouri Ozarks and its wealth of wooded hills, bluff-lined valleys and sparkling float streams. “The proximity of this property to other state parks makes it a unique destination for a family vacation to really experience the Ozarks,” said Bill Bryan, director of Missouri State Parks. “You could spend a day floating, a day hiking and a day fishing in one of the most scenic parts of our state.” The property, historically known as Camp Zoe, opened in 1929 as a summer youth camp where thousands of Missourians and Midwesterners enjoyed formative outdoor experiences. It has been an attraction since because of its location in a deep wooded valley cut by Sinking Creek, which Bryan called “a quintessential Ozark stream.” “It’s set in a valley with towering bluffs, and high quality forest on the ridges,” Bryan said. “Sinking Creek presents an opportunity to do all the things Missourians love to do in Ozark streams – floating, fishing or just playing in the water.” The property, which the state purchased at public auction in 2013, is located on State Highway 19, about halfway between Salem and Eminence in the heart of the Missouri Ozarks. It is near national forest, state conservation areas and the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, the national park that protects the Current and Jacks Fork rivers. The importance to the state park system is the location of the property to the other established parks in the area. Parks within an easy drive include: Current River State Park: The park, across Highway 19 from the Camp Zoe property, preserves a historic corporate retreat on the banks of the Current River. It has a hiking trail, two fishing ponds, river access and tours of the vintage buildings. “The proximity of Current River State Park means you’ll have two outstanding recreational resources – Sinking Creek and Current River,” Bryan said. Montauk, Johnson’s Shut-Ins and Elephant Rocks state parks: Montauk is a trout fishing park at the headwaters of the Current River. The Shut-Ins has Missouri’s most popular swimming hole. Elephant Rocks is a maze of giant pink granite boulders. All are a short drive from the new property. “You can fish at Montauk, or visit Johnson’s Shut-Ins and Elephant Rocks,” Bryan said. “This new development will be a place where a family can stay for a week and not do the same thing twice.” Also adjacent to the new state park is the Roger Pryor Pioneer Backcountry. This 64,000-acre area is owned by the L-A-D Foundation and includes a trail system cooperatively managed by Missouri State Parks. The Backcountry is adjacent to the new park which could serve as a base camp for hiking. Page 2 of 2 - “The new development will be a key entryway to Roger Pryor Pioneer Backcountry,” Bryan said. “It provides the opportunity for serious backpackers to get out and stretch their legs, and for families to experience day hikes.” A Sound Like an Echo Bryan said the new park will include a lodge with 20 guest rooms, a store, casual dining area, meeting spaces and a banquet room. The park will also include full-service cabins with two, three and four bedrooms that can accommodate families and larger groups. The 62-site campground will include both 50-amp electric and water, and full-hook up sites. The timetable is to have the amenities available in 2016. On a recent tour of the property, Bryan led the way by a small spring lined with watercress along a shaded path down to a sand beach. The beach was across from the property’s signature feature – a buff-colored bluff that curved out over the clear waters of Sinking Creek. “If you get over near the concave base, the wind really whistles off it and makes a sound like an echo.” The Complete Ozark Experience The creek runs for 1.75 miles through the property, and then flows into the Current River approximately a quarter-mile from the park, allowing park visitors great opportunities to float the Current using the park as both a starting point and an ending point for their floats. The creek includes deep holes to support smallmouth fishing. Because it has fewer springs than the Current River, it is warmer for swimming. Bryan stopped to photograph tracks left by wildlife on the sand beach, including bobcat, turkey and possibly bald eagle. The wild horses that roam this area of the Ozarks also had left ample evidence. “We could see a family staying here and maybe going for a horseback ride in Eminence or a hike in the backcountry, then floating Sinking Creek or the Current River, then maybe taking a day trip to Montauk, Johnson’s Shut-Ins or Elephant Rocks,” Bryan said. “You’ll get the complete Ozark experience.” For more information, visit mostateparks.com.
