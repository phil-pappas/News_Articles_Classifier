Flights from Pierre Trudeau International Airport will mark the arrival of the airline's first gateway in the province of Quebec, and 16th in North America. \nAs part of Icelandair's extensive timetable, four flights a week will be offered from Canada's second largest city through November 8, 2016 with departures on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The five-hour, non-stop flight to Icelandair's hub at Keflavik International Airport also provides connections to more than 20 destinations in Europe, including Paris, London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo. \nAfter the signing of the 2007 open skies agreement between Iceland and Canada, Icelandair continued to develop service from the Great White North. Following the commencement of Halifax in 1998, new gateways were launched including Toronto in 2008, Edmonton and Vancouver in 2014, and with today's announcement, Montreal beginning in 2016. \n\"Montreal will be our fifth Canadian gateway, opening the skies to Europe from Canada's second largest city. The addition of Montreal will give Canadians coast to coast more options in travel from Canada and provide both the business and leisure traveler a refreshing alternative when traveling to Iceland and beyond,\" said Birkir Holm Gudnason, Icelandair CEO. \nIcelandair, in operation since 1937, has a long, illustrious history of providing flights from North America to Europe. Since its inception, Icelandair has continued to grow as an airline with fleet-wide on-board Wi-Fi access, personal in-flight entertainment, three cabins of service and two checked bags included. \n\"The arrival of Icelandair marks yet another significant milestone for Aeroports de Montreal and Montreal. Not only will our passengers now have non-stop access to Iceland, but they will also be able to quickly connect to Scandinavian cities like Copenhagen and Stockholm. We are very pleased to welcome this new partner,\" said James Cherry, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADM. \nIcelandair offers service to Iceland from Boston, Chicago-ORD, Denver, Edmonton, New York-JFK, Newark, Seattle, Toronto, and Washington, D.C.; and seasonal service from Anchorage, Halifax, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Montreal, Orlando, Portland, OR, and Vancouver, BC.
