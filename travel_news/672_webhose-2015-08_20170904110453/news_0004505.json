Somewhere away from the crowds and relatively untouched? \nThe Crooked Compass has found some of the world’s best undiscovered treasures for those moments when you’re looking for something not usually found on the tourist maps. \nEben Ice Caves, Michigan, USA \nThe Rock River Canyon Ice Cave — better known as the Eben Ice Caves — have remained a mystery to many largely because of their hidden location. \nPart of the 1600 hectare Rock River Wilderness area of the Hiawatha National Forest, the Eben Ice Caves come to life in winter when melting snow runs over the edge of a small cliff and freezes, forming “ice caves.” \nTip: Wear boots with nice, grippy soles at the very minimum, and if possible, wear some sort of ice cleats on the bottoms of your shoes. Be awed by the hidden ice caves.

You’ll notice that the different colours separate from each other to form a layered spectrum. \nTip: Sunrise is the best time to see the Coloured Earths. Looking more like a painting than real life. The Seven Coloured Earth.

These beautiful, crystal clear blue pools are part of the River Brittle and are open to swimmers brave enough to jump into its freezing waters. \nThe walk to the first main pool is 1.2km and will take the average person around 20 minutes to get there. From there take some time to work your way up the river from the first waterfall exploring the different pools. \nTip: Take care after heavy rainfall when river crossings can become dangerous. Follow the trail of the river and waterfalls and see the series of blue pools.

Bacteria in the water feeds on the matter and poops out methane, which then turns into white floating blobs when it comes into contact with frozen water. \nTip : You’ll get the best photos at sunrise or sunset but be sure to check the ice thickness first before venturing out on the frozen lake. It looks like something from outer space.

You can also ride a horse or organise a helicopter to drop you in. \nDanakil Depression, Dallol, Ethiopia \nThe Danakil Depression, is a strange lunar landscape studded with active volcanoes, malodorous sulphur-caked hot springs, solidified black lava flows and vast salt-encrusted basins. \nIt is renowned as one of the hottest places on Earth with an average temperature of 34-35 degrees Celsius. \nIt may be one of the most inhospitable regions in the world, but it’s also one of the most spectacular. \nTip: Travellers should be self-sufficient in food and water (bank on a minimum of five litres of drinking water each per day, and carry enough excess in jerry cans to last a few days extra) and will need to take camping and cooking gear, since no accommodation or firewood are available. The desert nights can be refreshingly chilly, so bring a light jumper or a sweatshirt. It’s like taking a trip to another planet.

Even during times of war, tribes would ask for truce, so warriors could come to Osoyoos Lake and heal their wounds. \nOsoyoos is one of the most mineral-rich bodies of water on Earth, featuring mostly sulfates of magnesium, calcium and sodium. During the summer, as the lake’s water evaporates, it leaves behind the minerals, which take the shape of pools. Each natural pool has a different colour, depending on the type and concentration of the minerals. \nTip: You cannot walk between the pools anymore. A fence has been erected and viewing must take place behind it. A UFO dotted landscape.

The coloured waters percolate up from underground full of carbon dioxide which forms bubbles near the surface where the water temperature is a steaming 74 degrees Celsius. \nTip: Being an active volcanic area with undulating terrain, sturdy footwear is recommended, it is not a good idea to wear jandals, sandals or flip-flops. The waters are constantly simmering away. Source: Supplied", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:16:23.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
