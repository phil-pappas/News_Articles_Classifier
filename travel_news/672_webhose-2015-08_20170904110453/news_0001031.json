Programs which support businesses to invest in the development of new export markets are, ultimately, highly valuable Australia’s economic future.”\nMr Shelley said ATEC had made a submission to the review, outlining the value of the program to export tourism businesses across Australia and calling for even greater investment, restoring previous levels of funding equivalent to $228 million in current terms.\n“While we recognise the Abbott Government has taken steps towards restoring the levels of EMDG funding, the report shows we are now seeing a growing number of applicants – a number which will only increase as demand for Australian goods from overseas markets increases.\n“There is much at stake, with international spending on Australian export tourism products growing at 10% a year, so we must have significant Government focus on providing our industry with the tools it needs to capitalise further on this success.”\nThe Review reveals each dollar of an EMDG scheme grant generated an economic benefit of $7.03 when industry spillovers and productivity gains were taken into account.\nSource:-ATEC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:33:10.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
