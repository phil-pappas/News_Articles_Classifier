Located on a long stretch of powdery white beach, the Grace Bay Resorts Residences villas each feature five bedrooms, 18-foot ceilings, and Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances. With 6,400-square-feet of interior elegance and plenty of outdoor space, the villas are well suited for families and large groups. \nTwo of the villas were designed by prolific interior designer Thom Filicia, who blended Caribbean colors and natural beach elements to create an earthy, classic motif. The master bedrooms capture the splendor of the Caribbean Sea by incorporating turquoise-linen-lined tables. In the main living space are found green-and-blue, Bombay-print cotton fabrics used to create the window dressings and throw pillows; stools with touches of crackled gold; and custom Sherwood sofa daybeds. The exterior spaces are equally appealing: Each villa boasts an infinity pool, a palapa , outdoor showers, and private beach access. \nGuests can take advantage of private airport transfers, concierge services, and daily complimentary breakfasts served in-villa. All guests of the Residences also enjoy access to the resort’s amenities, which include pools, hot tubs, and tennis courts. Current rates for the Residences begin at $3,500 per night for up to 12 guests.
