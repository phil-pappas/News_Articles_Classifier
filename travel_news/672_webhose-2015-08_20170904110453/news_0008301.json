The tour of the 60-room property focused on how small businesses in the hotel industry, like the Fairfield Inn & Suites, help generate thousands of jobs in Wyoming and highlighted the various career opportunities within the hotel industry.\nThe property tour was led by the Fairfield Inn & Suites Cheyenne General Manger Delinda Johnson. The “Heart of the House” hotel tour provided Senator Enzi and his staff an opportunity to walk through the property, meet with employees and get a deeper understanding of the impact the hotel industry has on the local economy.\n“As a former small business owner and senior member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I understand the importance of supporting our small businesses,” Senator Enzi said. “It was a pleasure touring the Fairfield Inn & Suites Cheyenne and learning more about how the hotel industry provides a pathway to good-paying jobs and quality career opportunities, as well as boosting our local and state economies.”\nWyoming’s hotels are an important segment of the state’s economy. With 14.2 percent of all jobs directly or indirectly related to the lodging industry, Wyoming generates $127.1 million in tax revenue for state and local governments. Many of the properties are small business, a segment of the economy responsible for 63 percent of jobs in the state. The hotel industry in Wyoming reaches beyond providing guests with comfortable rooms or convenient meeting spaces – these hotels are interlinked with many other industries, such as transportation, restaurants and agriculture, supporting $788 million in total sales throughout the state.\n“Senator Enzi has always been a staunch supporter of small businesses and understands that the vast majority of hotels in our state, including the Fairfield Inn & Suites Cheyenne, are small businesses that create jobs and grow our local and state economies,” said General Manager Delinda Johnson. “We applaud his dedication in ensuring that businesses like ours continue to succeed and increase travel and tourism.”\nThe American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA), the sole national association representing all segments of the 1.8 million-employee lodging industry, works with state associations to engage with members of Congress on the “Heart of the House” hotel tours, which provide an in-depth look at the career opportunities available as well as the economic impact the lodging industry has on the local, state and national economies.\nSource:- AH&LA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T03:27:51.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
