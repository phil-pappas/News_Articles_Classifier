The upgrades bring a few hardware overhauls, but also offer a number of software tweaks to try to get Samsung to stand out more.\nThe trend of ever-bigger phones continues. The Edge+ has a 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED screen, over the 5.1-inch screen on the regular Edge. Resolution is kept the same at 2560×1440, but Pixel density per inch slightly decreases from 577 to 518 on the new phone. Meanwhile, the Note 5′s screen size stays the same at 5.7 inch, but it gets slightly skinnier than the Note 4.\nBoth phones get their RAM upgraded to 4GB, up from 3GB. The Edge+’s application processor stays the same with Samsung’s internally-developed 64-bit, quad-core Exynos 7420 built on a 14-nanometer node. The Note 5 gets a processor upgrade with the Exynos 7420 from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor found in the Note 4 (or the Exynos 5433 found in Korea version of the Note 4).\nThe Edge+ packs a larger battery of 3,000 milli-ampere hour, over the Edge’s 2,600 mAh. The Note 5, however, gets a battery downgrade, going from 3,220 mAh in the Note 4 to 3,000 mAh in the Note 5.\nThe Note 5 uses higher-quality materials. Instead of a plastic back, it’s now glass. This is bad news for Samsung consumers who liked the removable back that allowed them to switch out the battery or expand their phone’s storage capabilities.\nSimilar to the S6 Edge, the Edge+ packs a 16-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel on the front.\nBut some of the more important changes are coming in software.\nA new feature called App Edge gives users quicker access to their favorite apps from any screen on the Edge+. The menu can appear any where the user decides to place it along the side of the Edge+. It works similar to the People Edge feature on the Edge, where users can get quick access to their top five contacts. This makes it so the user doesn’t constantly have to be pulling up the home screen to get to their favorite app.\nThe Note 5′s S Pen stylus gets a little more useful. Without even having to wake up the screen, users can start writing on the Note 5 and take notes like on a piece of paper. The S Pen’s air command features have been improved. Air commands lets users hover the S Pen over the screen and a menu pops up. In the new version, users can add their favorite S Pen apps. The S Pen’s performance has also been boosted with decreased latency between when the screen is touched and when the markings start showing up on the screen.\nThe new devices also improve Samsung’s SideSync, which syncs a user’s phone together with a PC or TV. The 4.0 version makes it easier to connect. As soon as a user gets home, their phone starts syncing up with their computer if they’re on the same network. SideSync will allow users to do anything they want on their phone directly on their computer (respond to texts, take phone calls), as well as drag and drop files from either the PC or the phone. The software will also be available on the Mac soon.\nThe two phones also give users the ability to scroll capture the images on their screen. That means users can grab and save a long web page from top to bottom in case they want to save it for later. This could be useful if the user wants to save directions to go somewhere for later when they might not have a data connection.\nSamsung is putting more effort into kickstarting Samsung Pay, its effort in the mobile wallet space. Right now, it’s being piloted in the South Korea and it plans to launch in the U.S. in September. Samsung’s devices use both MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) and NFC (Near Field Communication) technologies, so users don’t have to wait until stores roll out NFC-enabled point of sale terminals to pay for goods with their phones. For Apple Pay, users have to wait for this roll out.\nFinally, perhaps one of the most quirkiest new software features on the two new phones is the ability to live broadcast video directly to YouTube. In both phones’ camera app, there’s a live broadcast mode where users will be able to immediately start broadcasting. “The benefit of that is that it’s accessible to any platform,” said Drew Blackard, director of product marketing at Samsung. “Users can play it back on a phone, laptop, TV, anyone with access to YouTube.”\nWhile the big standouts will be some of the software improvements, it makes sense Samsung is focusing on hardware updates for its S6 Edge device and not the S6. Although sales figures weren’t released for either phone, Samsung apparently didn’t anticipate how much demand there would be for the S6 Edge. Consumers had been wanting to buy the Edge, but they were not always finding it in stock.\n“Samsung recognizes that the curved screen on the Edge is a differentiator for them,” said Charles Golvin, founder of Abelian Research. “It’s different from the iPhone. It has unique functionality.”\nBut will this be enough? Even though Samsung is trying to get ahead of Apple in the competitive launch cycle, the iPhone 6′s larger screens really hit Samsung’s advantage in the premium smartphone market.\n“Samsung is putting effort into software to extend their differentiation in other ways,” said Golvin. “They’re continuing to iterate and fine tune. But it doesn’t make a big difference. There’s not a lot to differentiate these devices these days.”\nBoth devices go up for pre-order starting today and are available in the U.S. on August 21.\nFollow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/aatilley"], "published": "2015-08-13T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:12:01.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
