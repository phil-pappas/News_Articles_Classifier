Photo credit Randy Tunnell.\nStave Wine Cellar is a wine lounge and cellar at The Inn at Spanish Bay that invites visitors to indulge in wines by the glass, small bites and a wide selection of coveted, hard-to-find bottles for purchase. This intimate setting coupled with knowledgeable staff, including Certified Sommeliers, is ideal for special wine dinners, events or simply gathering with friends and colleagues.\n“When we were designing Stave Wine Cellar, our vision was for it to be a place that reflects the charm and casual character of The Inn at Spanish Bay, but with a contemporary style all its own,” said Wendy Heilmann, Director of Wine and Spirits for Pebble Beach Resorts. “Stave Wine Cellar is all about exploration and the experience of different varietals, and this is a place for anyone and everyone curious about the world of wine. We are excited to share the passion we have for wine with our visitors.”\nThe Stave Wine Cellar concept is part lounge and part wine shop, providing a luxurious yet comfortable space to explore the intricacies of the wine world. In addition to more than 30 wines and eight craft beers by the glass, Stave Wine Cellar features more than 250 wines for purchase by the bottle, which line the walls in custom-crafted honeycomb shelving. To expose visitors to new and unique tastes outside of Monterey County, wines by the glass include intriguing regional and international wines that hail from countries like Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Argentina, and California regions including Sonoma, Mendocino County, Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz. Stave Wine Cellar also has on-hand a Coravin device, which allows guests to explore new varietals and taste pristine wine without having to purchase the entire bottle. This includes coveted selections such as Sine Qua Non, Kistler, Caymus, Screaming Eagle and Opus One.\nIn addition to wine and beer, Stave Wine Cellar offers a menu of cheese & charcuterie plates to complement the varietals, and also holds special winemaker tastings, wine walks and events each month. Out-of-town guests are welcome to order wine bottles from Stave Wine Cellar via phone, for delivery to their homes.\nThe interiors of Stave Wine Cellar are striking – anchored by a double-sided stone fireplace that is the centerpiece to the room, the space is appointed with a cozy leather couch and chairs, dark wood tables, a communal high-top table and a wine bar. Stave Wine Cellar at Spanish Bay takes its name from a stave, which is one of the individual strips of wood that form the sides of a wine barrel.\nSource:- Pebble Beach Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T21:06:09.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
