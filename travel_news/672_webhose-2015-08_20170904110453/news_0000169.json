PUBLISHED: 08:04, Thu, Aug 13, 2015 | UPDATED: 08:18, Thu, Aug 13, 2015 PH Crystal River Cruise \nThe new Crystal Cruises brand will also have fewer guests than many river cruise ships, with just 70 suites, and will offer Crystal's signature all-inclusive \"six-star\" service. \n\"We continue to listen to what our guests and the luxury traveller want, and river cruises are what they've been telling us they want for some time,\" says Crystal President and CEO Edie Rodriguez. \n\"It's a natural extension of the exceptional ocean cruise Crystal has offered for the past 25 years but, more importantly, they want to experience river cruises on a luxury Crystal vessel, and their desires will be fulfilled on our luxury Crystal river yachts.\" \nThe luxury ships will be built by German shipyard Lloyd Werft to feature industry-firsts such as 250 square-foot guest suites with walk-in wardrobes, American king size beds. \nThere will also be two 500 square-foot Penthouse Suites available and \"spacious public areas\" to include a Palm Court with dance floor and glass domed roof, plus a fitness centre and spa. \nItineraries will be announced on December 1, 2015, when the first bookings will be taken. PH Crystal River Cruise suite Our guests will have the opportunity to revel in the unique environment that sets river cruising apart from other travel experiences. Edie Rodriguez \nPre and post-hotel stays, a common option on river cruises, will not be necessary because the new Crystal ships will often overnight in ports, offering more time for \"meaningful shore-side excursions \nand experiences\". \nThe company also intends to use off-the-beaten track routes to avoid other cruise ships and congestion at moorings. \nScenic daytime cruising will also be part of the itinerary, so that passengers can see the scenery - most river cruise ships sail during dinner and early in the morning. \nAnd the overnight stays will give guests the chance to enjoy city nightlife, and inclusive culinary experiences at Michelin-starred restaurants and other evening events and entertainment. \n\"The beauty of river cruising is not only that travellers enjoy close-up access to more fascinating inland locales, but also that the rivers themselves are coveted destinations that shouldn't be overlooked,\" says Rodriguez. \n\"Our guests will have the opportunity to revel in the unique environment that sets river cruising apart from other travel experiences.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:12:32.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
