Photographer's Note \nSérie sobre a minha viagem à ARGENTINA - visitando El Calafate e El Chaltén (Província de Santa Cruz) - Patagônia e San Martin de los Andes (Província de Neuquén) - De 18 de julho a 07 de Agosto de 2015 - Nº 007 ! Series on my trip to ARGENTINA - visiting El Calafate and El Chaltén (Province of Santa Cruz) - Patagonia and San Martin de los Andes (Province of Neuquén) - From July 18th to August 7th 2015 - #007 ! MIRADOR RÍO DE LAS VUELTAS ! MIRANTE RIO DAS VOLTAS ! LOOK-OUT RIVER OF THE TURNS! Here, after two days of snow, rain, wind and mist, the day had started well, with sun, and I started to climb up to the MIRADOR FITZ ROY, walking along the FITZ ROY TRAIL. One walks one kilometer and reaches this LOOK-OUT and I was impressed by its beauty! Weather conditions helped to create a special mood as well! I rented a car to see MOUNTS FITZ ROY and TORRES from the road, traveling from EL CALAFATE to EL CHALTÉN and back. However, the weather was terrible (including the worst blowing winds I've ever faced in my life) and I couldn't see them. But I had planned to stay longer in EL CHALTÉN, for some walks and shooting pictures. So I traveled by bus and had the great chance to see those mounts from a certain distance, when the bus driver, fortunately, pulled over. The weather was better and after checking in, I did my first short walk (SENDERO DE LOS CONDORES / TRILHA DOS CONDORES / CONDORS TRAIL) and had some great views from FITZ ROY AND TORRE! Unfortunately, I stayed two days in the village and couldn't get out of my room, because weather was terrible again, with snow, rain and cloudy skies! O well, we cannot win all the time!!! But then, I walked along the trail to FITZ ROY, not until its end, because it's winter and it's impossible to get there and had some wonderful views!
