This is a significant coup for the festival as Mr Dora’s opening night film Ghadi was Lebanon’s official submission to the Academy Awards and has been well received around the world.”The festival is produced by Information and Cultural Exchange (ICE). Its organising committee represents Australia’s diverse Arabic-speaking communities and cultures.\nSource:- Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:17:58.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
