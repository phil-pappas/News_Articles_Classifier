The electric top drive system accounted for the major market share of 88%, followed by hydraulic top drives, which held a share of 12% in 2014. This report provides an analysis about the drivers, restraints, and opportunities of the global top drive market. Growth in drilling and exploration activities and increasing need for energy from emerging economies are expected to be the major drivers in increasing the usage of top drives globally. However, with the current oil price scenario, the growth would be limited this year; however, it is expected to regain its growth in the coming years once the crude price is stabilized. Furthermore, growing offshore oil & gas reserves provide huge growth opportunities to the top drive market. This report also covers the activities of major key players in this segment, and strategies adopted by them through expansions, mergers &acquisitions, and new product launches.\nThe onshore segment holds the major share in the top drive market. Offshore drilling requires precise and advanced technologies, making its drilling a capital intensive one. At the same time, complexities and service requirement are more in the case of offshore drilling activities. Although, offshore application holds a lesser market share, it is expected to grow at a faster pace. North America holds the largest market due to rise in exploration & drilling activities and an increase in the number of drilling rigs. The U.S. dominates the market in this region due to the development of shale gas and technological innovations. The demand for top drive for onshore as well as offshore purposes is boosting the region's global position.\nMajor companies profiled in this research include Aker Solutions, Cameron International Corporation, Honghua Group Limited, National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Tesco Corporation, Axon Energy Products, Bentec GmbH Drilling & Oilfield Systems, Canrig Drilling Technology Limited, Daqing Jinghong Petroleum Equipment Corporation, Foremost, Panjin Liaohe Oilfield Tianyi Petroleum Equipment Company Limited and Warrior Manufacturing Services Limited.
