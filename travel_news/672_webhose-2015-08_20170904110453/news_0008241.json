But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments. Greece is living up to its ambitious reform commitments,” he said in a statement after six hours of gruelling talks in Brussels Friday.\nGreece will receive a first instalment of 13 billion euros next week, helping cover a debt payment due to the ECB next Thursday.\nEurozone ministers said the first main 26-billion tranche of the bailout will include an “immediate” payment of 10 billion euros to Greece’s banks, which are desperately short of cash after panicked customers flocked to withdraw their money.\nThe deal must still be approved by parliaments in several European countries to go ahead — notably in Germany, Europe’s effective paymaster, where lawmakers are set to vote on Wednesday.\n 15, 2015 8:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T03:36:32.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
