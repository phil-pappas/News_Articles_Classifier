In most rescues, swimmers are not in distress but were at risk of being pulled away from shore by a rip current, Arbin said. \n\"If the person doesn't respond to the whistle and flags, then the lifeguard will make a rescue,\" Arbin said. \"Most of them were the more preventative type of rescues.\" \nForecasts suggest the seas will start to calm Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:28:40.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
