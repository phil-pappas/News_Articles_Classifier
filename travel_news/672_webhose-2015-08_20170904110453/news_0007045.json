According to the findings, uses during travel largely originated from the interviewees’ daily lives “because of habits and social norms and obligations”. \n\nThey noted that the interviewees feel socially obligated to stay connected during trips because they are so used to constant communication. Hence, “routines and habits were carried to the context of travel”, the researchers explain. \n\nThe study concludes that because of the advance in technology, friends, families and colleagues are all just a simple swipe away. This makes it very difficult to truly “switch off” while on vacation. \n\nThey add, however, that this connectedness is a universally positive experience as they allow people to maintain social ties back home, thus feeling less isolated. \n\nUtility apps also afford greater convenience when travelling while entertainment options allow travellers to indulge in being themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:49:23.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
