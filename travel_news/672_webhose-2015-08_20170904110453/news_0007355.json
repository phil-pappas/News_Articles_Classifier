This will provide the clearance necessary to ensure a lower line speed will not have to be put in place through Dundas Aqueduct for the diesel trains that will be cascaded from the Thames Valley to service the valley branch lines once the new electric trains begin servicing the Great Western Main Line.\nThese particular diesel trains are longer, enabling passengers to benefit from more seats while maintaining journey times. The track lowering work will also enable this branch line to be used as a diversionary route for freight services in the future.\nAndy Haynes, Network Rail’s project director for the west of England, said: “We have reached a major milestone in our work to prepare Bath’s railway line for electrification. Not only are we past the halfway point and still on schedule, but one of the most complex aspects of our track lowering work is now complete.”\nAs the ‘orange army’ head into the final phases of the project, work has started to lower the main line that runs from London Paddington towards the South West, while the team continues its work to lower the tracks at Bathampton Junction.\nThis work has presented its own challenges, including the need to remove more waste material from the site at Bathampton Junction than anticipated. However, the team’s contingency plans meant an additional train to carry the waste material away from the site was available to be sent in at short notice.\nAndy continued: “This is a challenging project, but I’m pleased to say we remain on schedule for reopening the line on 1 September.\n“We apologise for any inconvenience caused as a result of our work, but the arrival of electrification and the new fleet of electric trains will have many long-term benefits for both passengers and those who live close to the railway line, as well as boosting economic growth across the South West.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:30:52.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
