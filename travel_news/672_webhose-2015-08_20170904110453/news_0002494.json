About 500 people attended that year; now more than 1 million people go each year. Although an affiliated open-air concert called Panorama takes place this year on the Saturday at Emslie Horniman Pleasance Park, the carnival begins on the Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend (August 30), with a ‘Family Day’ programme. Early risers - or those who have yet to go to bed - can enjoy proceedings from 6am to 9am, when J’Ouvert takes place. This opening ceremony features dancing and musical performances and is intended to set the tone for the coming days of celebration. Notting Hill Carnival is always a popular choice for August Bank holiday festivities Photo: Getty After a brief pause, official festivities continue from 10am to 8.30pm. Lasting for hours, a Children's Parade sees a procession, mainly of children in vividly coloured costumes, weave its way through the streets of Notting Hill. Music plays throughout the day and there are plenty of food stalls and diversions to entertain visitors too. As you’d assume, the family day is less busy and chaotic than the following day’s festivities - but these things are relative. If you do decide to visit with young children, be prepared to tackle significant crowds and queues for toilets, food stalls and so on. Wheeling a pram could prove cumbersome, too. • The best family days out from London Bank holiday Monday, August 31, is when the main parade takes place and the carnival is at its most intense. It’s a spectacular procession featuring innumerable community groups, clubs and 60 bands, all exuberant, energetic and dressed in costume. Away from the procession, 38 static sound systems scattered throughout Notting Hill will broadcast diverse genres of music and accommodate performances. Notting Hill Carnival 2015 route map The blue icons represent different sound systems; the yellow icons represent bars and clubs Though the procession follows the route shown on the Notting Hill Carnival map above, it’s good to take a spontaneous approach to the best places to watch proceedings. Crowds can be particularly intense in places and there's plenty of action in the streets that radiate from the main route and sound systems – with such a huge turnout, people-watching opportunities here are unmatched and photographers will find much to document. The carnival officially finishes at around 7pm on Monday, but for those who want to continue the celebrations, various after-parties will continue into the night. More on Notting Hill Carnival Cost: the carnival is free to attend Getting there: reaching the carnival can be an ordeal. To help control the crowds, Tube stations in the vicinity can close and buses can be diverted, so it is best to consult the TfL website for the latest information prior to your departure to determine the best route from your starting point. However you reach the event, be prepared for immense crowds. Events begin on Bank Holiday Sunday, which is marginally calmer and quieter than Monday's occasionally boisterous programme. If you've got young children this is the day to take them.

We have recommendations for the best hotels in West London , central London and south-west London . Notting Hill Carnival tips Carnival organisers have provided helpful suggestions on how to best enjoy the celebrations. Many may seem obvious but they’re worth keeping in mind. Arrange a meeting place should you lose your friends – mobile phone coverage may not be reliable. Don’t wear sandals or open-topped shoes. Your feet are likely to get trampled on at some point and broken glass and rubbish will accumulate on the streets as the day progresses. Those with sensitive hearing might benefit from bringing ear plugs. Toilet roll, wet wipes, hand sanitiser and bottled water will likely come in useful. Be wary of pickpocketing and petty crime, and keep your valuables in a secure place.
