We visited our friends in Auckland and they were kind enough to tour us around. I was taking pictures of my daughter but suddenly I saw my friends' niece Hannah running towards a lone tree, so I took several shots of her. This is the only one that you can see her as the she was hidden on the trees' shadow on the rest of the shot. \nFrom stunning lakes in Asia, to pristine national parks in the US, we've received hundreds of photos from our readers, proving what an intrepid bunch Kiwi travellers are. \nThis week we have two winners for our readers' travel photo competition. \nCongratulations to Fred Aron, June's winner, for a spectular photo taken on Mt Wellington domain. Nicola Pye \nWe took the kids skiing last weekend, and while we missed the snow back home, we were lucky enough to catch just a beautiful little bit of it in Queenstown. It felt just like we were walking through a Christmas movie set! Full credit to the kidlets for sitting still on the frozen bench for long enough for me to get a photo :-) \nAnd congratulations to July's winner, Nicola Pye, for a stunning shot captured on a snowy day in Queenstown. \nSmugshot is taking a small break but we will be back soon.
