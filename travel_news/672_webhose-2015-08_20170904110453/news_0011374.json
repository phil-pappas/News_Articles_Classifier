Further, business email from GoDaddy gives GIA’s communication a professional touch, helping the company build credibility and trust in the brand.\nEstablished in 2008 by Mr. Pranav Chandra, a former New York banker, GIA creates fun and flexible Indian travel experiences. GIA’s knowledge, customized approach and attention to detail have made it a popular choice among travelers. Though word-of-mouth referrals have been GIA’s primary source of new customers, Mr. Chandra set up the company website in 2009 to expand GIA’s reach to a global scale.\n“By taking GIA online, I wanted to create a unique platform to provide the Insider’s India experience (without the hassle) on a platter to travel seekers around the world,” said Mr. Chandra. “GoDaddy’s superior customer care coupled with ease of use and value for money made me choose GoDaddy. GoDaddy’s 24×7 customer care team provided me with quick and easy resolution for any problem I faced along the way.”\nMr. Chandra is pleased with the performance of his website and says many online business inquiries received translate into business. Since establishing an online presence through GoDaddy, GIA has witnessed a steady rise in inbound customer queries coming from mostly overseas such as the U.S., Canada, Australia and South Africa.\n“India has always been a traveler’s haven. Yet, there are few online resources that offer authentic and bespoke Indian travel experiences to a worldwide audience. We are delighted that GoDaddy has been able to help Mr. Chandra bring India to the world,” said Rajiv Sodhi, Vice President and Managing Director, GoDaddy India and Australia. “Our aim is to equip small businesses and individuals with affordable, easy-to-use technology solutions and online tools, enabling them to build an impactful global online identity.”\nHeadquartered in Scottsdale, Ariz. USA, GoDaddy also has offices across nine other locations including Washington, Massachusetts, Iowa and California in the U.S., and international offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore and in the U.K.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:05:29.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
