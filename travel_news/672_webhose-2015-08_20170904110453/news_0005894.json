This is according to the latest numbers from the Federal Statistical Office based on statistics from accommodation facilities with ten or more beds as well as camping grounds. Overall, 27.1 million international overnights were registered, an increase of 4.1 percent.\nPetra Hedorfer, CEO of the German National Tourist Board (GNTB), explains these most recent numbers: „The big Western European source markets, in particular, contributed to the great result with excellent May numbers. Almost 500,000 extra overnights (nearly half the increase) were generated by our Top 3 markets, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Great Britain.”\nEurope continues to dominates the Top 10 markets\nIreland has generated an outstanding growth of incomes by 23 percent compared to the previous year. Even in May the number of incoming guests has risen by 18.1 percent.\nAfter a somewhat slow start in the beginning of the year, they were back to generating considerable growth in May. Switzerland contributed above average growth in the first five\nmonths of the year. After the U.S., Germany’s most important overseas markets, Italy, Austria, France, Denmark, Belgium and Poland round out the Top 10.\nKlaus Lohmann, director of the GNTO for UK and Ireland, added: “Germany is seen as an affordable and highly diverse destination which has something to offer all year round. This is reflected in these latest figures for overnight stays by visitors from Ireland to Germany”.\nDynamic growth in Asian markets\nThe Asia/Pacific source markets once again highlighted their great potential and contributed double digit growth to Germany’s incoming tourism between January and May, 2015. China performed particularly well (a 19.4 percent increase), followed by the Arab Gulf States (a 11.7 percent increase) and India (a 10.3 percent increase).\nThe U.S. remains in first place of the overseas source markets with 1.8 million overnights in the first five months (a 3.7 percent increase). Overall, the GNTB expects an increase of roughly three percent for the country’s incoming tourism in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:31:02.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
