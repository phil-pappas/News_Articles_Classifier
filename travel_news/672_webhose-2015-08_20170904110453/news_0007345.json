In the Outer Mani, set amid olive groves, Stoupa sits below the rocky peaks of the Taygetos mountain range, whose highest point, Profitis Ilias, soars 2407 m (7896 ft). Built around three sheltered turquoise bays, Stoupa offers a peaceful retreat from modern day life, and plenty of inspiration to delve into the ancient myths of gods and nymphs, and the tales of medieval tower houses and blood feuds for which the region is notorious. For most Grecophiles, the neighbouring village of Kardamyli (4 miles up the coast) is better known. For many years home to the British travel writer and adventurer Patrick Leigh Fermor (1915-2011), author of the highly recomended Mani: Travels in the South Peloponnese, Kardamyli is certainly prettier, with its old stone cottages and cafes clustered around a central square, overlooked by Upper Kardamyli, now deserted but posing a timeless image, with its medieval tower houses, 18th-century church and cypresses, perched up on the hillside, high above the coast. But the beaches at Stoupa are infinitely better. Made up of low-rise white modern concrete buildings, Stoupa focuses on the sea, with the main road south to Areopolis running behind the village, leaving it slow-paced and sun-beaten. The main beach is a broad stretch of pale sand, lying in a wide sweeping bay, lined with sun beds and umbrellas, and backed by a promenade with bars, cafes and restaurants. It’s popular with families with kids, and offers peddle-boats and canoes for hire, but can get busy in peak season. A 10-minute walk north from here, the lovely Kalogria beach sits in sheltered cove backed by tamarisk and palm trees, and has three informal tavernas. There’s a beach volleyball court on the golden sand, and the PADI-approved Dive Code scuba centre ( divecodegreece.com ) is based here. For something quieter, you might hike another 10 minutes north of Stoupa to Delfinia beach, a crescent of small grey pebbles backed by a lush olive grove – it’s a great spot for snorkeling, but the sea bed drops suddenly, so it gets very deep, making it unsuitable for small children. • Koufonissia, Greece: Secret Seaside • Karavostási, Greece: Secret Seaside Visit out of season for the best experience Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Moving inland to the windswept rugged mountains, you’ll find well-marked hiking paths leading through rocky herb-scented landscapes and rural villages to lonesome Byzantine churches and beyond. For a good one-day hike, tackle the Viros Gorge, which runs down to Kardamyli (12mi round route, 6-7 hours), taking you through woodland, up onto rocky tracks, and then down into the steep-sided gorge, where huge white boulders are scattered along the dry torrent bed. Be sure to carry plenty of water and wear good hiking shoes. Adventure sports specialists 2407 ( 2407m.com ) run organised hikes and hire out mountain bikes, and can also supply maps and local advice, should you choose to go it alone. Excursions further afield from Stoupa include the Diros Cave (29mi) near Areopolis, which you can enter by boat to see a huge cavern filled with spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, and Mystra (59mi), a fortified Byzantine town built into a steep hillside with half a dozen churches, now proclaimed a UNESCO world heritage site. • Kea, Greece: Secret Seaside • Voutoumi, Greece: Secret Seaside The main beach is a broad stretch of pale sand, lying in a wide sweeping bay Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Getting there Through summer, EasyJet (0330 365 5000; easyjet.com ) flies to Kalamata from London Gatwick, and Thomas Cook (01733 224 808; thomascook.com/flights ) from Birmingham, London Gatwick and Manchester.

Although most of his books are set on Crete, Kazantzakis lived in Stoupa in 1917, and it was here that he met the miner Giorgis Zorbas, the character who inspired the namesake in the book. Did you know? While swimming in Stoupa, you’ll come across some refreshingly icy-cold currents, although the sea is generally warm. These are caused by underwater springs that run down from the Taygetos mountains, and emerge below the sea bed.
