There is no better place to be than at the Grand Canyon during your summer vacation! To experience all the canyon has to offer, you'll want to book air tours, keeping in mind that this is the busiest time of year so book early. Online Bookings Make for the Best Deals Aside from booking early, I strongly advise that you book online. Booking online saves you money because you cut out any third parties. This means no additional booking fees, and the lowest available ticket prices. Another secret to cheap rates is to book the first or last flight of the day. When you choose these flights, you need to prepare yourself for a possibly bright sunrise in the morning or intense heat in the afternoon. West Rim and South Trim Tours Flights depart from Las Vegas, NV, or Tusayan, AZ. Vegas air tours will fly to the West rim, while the Arizona tours will take you to the South Rim. These are two unique experiences, so make sure you choose the one that appeal to you most. Even if you're staying in Vegas, you can take a connecting flight to the South Rim before hopping into a helicopter for your air tour. Vegas tours offer landing tours that are very appealing. On the tour, you have the chance to float down the Colorado River, or make the trek to the Skywalk and experience the truth majestic beauty of the Canyon. The bottom landing tour even includes a picnic where you can toast your adventure with a glass of complimentary Champagne. If you choose to fly from Arizona, you won't be able to land anywhere within the Canyon, but the spectacular views help to make up for this. There are a pair of tours you can choose from. The first is a 30 minute tour that flies you to the North Rim then heads back to the south and there is a 50 minute tour that takes the same route but adds an extra leg. Since you can see up to 75% of the park on the 50-minute flight, this is one adventure you won't want to miss. 4x4 tours are another tour type you can't book if you're visiting the West Rim of the park. If you're able to add these tours on to your park experience, you'll have another unique way to experience the park. Standard and Deluxe Packages Helicopter flights are available in both basic and deluxe options. No matter which you choose they offer the same routes, but the deluxe has unique perks. The modern EcoStar 130 has a huge wraparound windshield, a larger and quieter cabin, and the best seating in the air tours market. I recommend deluxe tours as long as you can work one into your budget. The experience alone makes it worth it. My Final Thoughts Don't pass up on this opportunity to make your summer vacation the best yet. Heli rides are the most exciting way to see the Canyon, and they also provide the best views. Don't forget to book early, book online, and make sure you choose the package that suits you best. There are plenty of adventures to be had at the Canyon, and with the tours available you can find one that will suit your personality and budget perfectly. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon recommends going here for a list of the best helicopter tours .
