Kitchen & Bar, no. 246, The Optimist, King + Duke, St. Cecilia, The El Felix, Superica and Marcel, will unveil Bar Margot at Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta later this year. Bar Margot will serve lunch and dinner daily and is slated to open September 28, 2015.\n“Atlanta needs a cool hotel bar with high-service standards, big-flavour food, and zero pretension,” Fry says. “Bar Margot will be a funky community lounge with uncomplicated, thoughtful food, small-batch spirits, and a rockin’ vinyl collection.” Fry is no stranger to the hotel scene, beginning his career at a luxury hotel in Aspen.\nPlayfully contradicting the buttoned-up hotel stereotype, Fry named the space after Margot Tenenbaum, Gwyneth Paltrow’s character in the Wes Anderson cult classic, The Royal Tenenbaums. “She portrays the sense of humour that runs through all my restaurants in one way or the other,” Fry says.\nThe menu is a collaboration between Fry and Four Seasons Chef Robert Gerstenecker. Gerstenecker serves as the Executive Chef of Four Seasons and is a 26-year veteran of the Four Seasons family. The two have consulted on Fry’s vision, and Gerstenecker will execute daily operations.\n“I’m excited to work alongside Ford to enhance the dining experience at Four Seasons,” Gerstenecker says. “Locals and guests have always enjoyed dining with us, but we want Bar Margot to be the number one reason they dine here. My culinary team and I couldn’t be more excited about this new direction.”\nThe Park 75 lounge area closed to prep for its refresh by Meyer Davis, the New York City-based firm that designed Fry’s King + Duke and St. Cecilia restaurants. The firm also recently completed a floor-to-ceiling renovation of the Hotel’s 50th floor event space, which will be unveiled later this month as the Penthouse Ballroom.\nPark 75 Restaurant – located across the terrace from the former Park 75 Lounge – will serve breakfast, lunch, dinner and provide full bar service during the renovations. Upon Bar Margot’s opening, Park 75 Restaurant will serve breakfast only.\n“While a handful of other Four Seasons properties have celebrity chef-driven restaurants, we’re thrilled to be one of the first Four Seasons with a local chef/restaurateur at the wheel,” General Manager Rajiv Malhotra at Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta says. “Ford understands service at the five-star level and has a true talent for creating food and atmosphere that feels accessible to everyone.”\nFry and Gerstenecker will draw heavily from local farmers and the Hotel’s rooftop garden and apiary, which Gerstenecker started in 2009. “Bar Margot is all about high-quality comfort foods and we will use as much fresh, local produce as possible.”\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T14:01:24.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
