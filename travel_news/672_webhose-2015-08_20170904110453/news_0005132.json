The Solheim Cup star and world top 50 ranked player joins 2016 Ryder Cup Captain Darren Clarke and former world number one Lee Westwood in representing the market leading golf travel brand. The Ricoh Women’s British Open at Turnberry will represent the beginning of a relationship running through the 2017 season.\nIn addition to logo placement on the Woburn player’s sleeve, Your Golf Travel will benefit from access to Hull and her assistance in promoting experiences including Solheim Cup attendance packages. The company also plans to create a programme of travel products aimed specifically at new and existing female golfers, with the aim of lowering the barriers to entry that some may currently experience.\nYour Golf Travel is actively investing in the women’s game and sees an opportunity to contribute to golf’s popularity among women and girls. Euan Gillon, Head of Commercial Partnerships, explained: “Women account for just 14% of regular golfers in the UK and Ireland, which compares to 27% in Scandinavia and 35% in the likes of Germany and Austria. We have a chance, perhaps even an obligation, to make golf more appealing to women and girls and Charley will help us with that. Having the top ranked English woman, the current Ryder Cup Captain and a past world number 1 in the men’s game as part of our team is pretty special.”\nCharley Hull: “I am excited to be representing Your Golf Travel out on the Tour. I really like how focused they are on making the game more appealing and accessible and a contribution to raising the profile of women’s golf and I look forward to helping them achieve this.”\nCharley Hull is 50th in the Rolex Rankings and is the highest ranked English player. Her career highlights include a professional win, leading the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit and an outstanding Solheim Cup debut in 2013.\nYour Golf Travel is the world’s largest golf travel company, carrying more than 200,000 passengers annually across 25 countries. Based in central London, it sells a range of golf travel products including attendance packages for high profile professional tournaments.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:33:30.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
