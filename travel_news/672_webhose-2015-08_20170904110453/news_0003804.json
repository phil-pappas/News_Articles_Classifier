Picture: Douglas Elliman Source: Supplied\nYes, this is the building that houses the most expensive apartment ever sold in New York City — a palatial duplex on its 89th and 90th floors, which went for a whopping US$100,471,452.77 late last year to an anonymous buyer.\nOther features include high ceilings, brand-name appliances and a master suite with three walk-in closets and two marbled master baths.\nRoom with a view ... the master suite has three walk-in closets and two marbled master baths. Picture: Douglas Elliman Source: Supplied\nTo get technical, it’s the fifth most-expensive rental in the entire city, according to real estate listing site StreetEasy.\nBut any pricier pad you could lease are all in hotels — two at the Pierre for US$500,000 and US$400,000 per month, and two at the Surrey for US$450,000 and US$300,000.\nThis One57 pad’s extravagant price tag is mostly due to its location in a high-profile building, but there are some perks, too. Residents have access to a gym, yoga studio, business centre, bike storage and a party room with a kitchen caterers can use. There’s also permission to swim in the pool at the Park Hyatt, the five-star hotel that takes up the bottom 25 floors of One57.\nMaking plans ... the 416-square-metre pad on the 65th floor of One57, the first complete building on 57th Street’s Billionaires’ Row, has three bedrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms.

(And baulk at that price.)\nThe property is listed for rent by Douglas Elliman.\nPerks ... residents have permission to swim in the pool at the Park Hyatt, the five-star hotel that takes up the bottom 25 floors of One57.
