Hawthorn is providing sound, lighting, AV and technical equipment for the internationally recognised Edinburgh Festival Fringe once again this year, working with renowned producers including Universal Arts, at the New Town Theatre, Momentum Venues at St Stephen’s Church and Paradise Green at Augustines. \nEight Hawthorn trucks have already headed to Scotland’s capital, to enable producers across the Fringe to deliver their creative vision for over 200 diverse shows, from countries including Romania, China and Australia. The equipment includes recent investments, the ETC Ion and Gio Control Desks, purchased specifically for this year’s Fringe, adding to Hawthorn’s extensive range of kit for hire. Hawthorn’s Head of Hire, David Slater, who possesses over 20 years of working with venues and theatres, commented: “We are very excited to have been given the opportunity to work with our clients to supply key venues of this internationally recognised festival for the 26th year in a row. “The festival is a hot bed for emerging acts and features many different forms of the traditional arts, which demands a broad range of equipment and expertise. It is a delight to be so engrained in supporting the delivery of these shows, enabling creative talent to shine.” Tomek Borkowy, Artistic Director of Universal Arts, said: \"We are delighted that Hawthorn is supporting Universal Arts at EdFringe 2015. This is the 3rd year we have worked together to offer our visiting international companies the best technical services to ensure their festival is a success. We value our relationships with all our sponsors and supporters and thank Hawthorn for providing equipment and training to our technical team.” Hawthorn will also sponsor the respected Association of Lighting Designers (ALD) drinks on 7th August. Funds remaining after the event will be donated to Behind the Scenes (formerly Light Relief), a charity established by and for the entertainment technology industry, to help theatre lighting designers in times of extreme hardship. Martin Hawthorn, Managing Director of Hawthorn, added: “We’re delighted to be supporting and participating in this important industry event. It’s a great opportunity for us to celebrate and thank many of our freelance colleagues for their support of Hawthorn.” Hawthorn is one of London Stock Exchange’s ‘1000 Companies to Inspire Britain 2015’; the creative technical production experts boast a portfolio of high profile clients and work across a wide spectrum of live events from staging large-scale public spectaculars to the styling of more intimate dinners.
