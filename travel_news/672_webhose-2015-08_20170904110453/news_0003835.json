Las Vegas climbed one spot on the ranking compared to last year, while Chicago dropped two places from number one in 2014 to round out the top three. \nThe top 10 cities for 2015 are: \n1. Orlando, FL 9. Nashville, TN 10. Phoenix, AZ \n“Competition for meetings and conventions business continues to be very heated between destinations that are eager to attract events to boost their local economies,” Bharet Malhotra, senior vice president of sales for the Cvent Supplier Network, said in a statement. “This year we witnessed several cities vying for a position in the top 50 list, with significant movement within the ranks. One of the interesting trends this year has been the rise of smaller cities moving ahead of and even displacing destinations that are near large metro areas but not downtown.” \nSmaller cities have been actively investing in and expanding their infrastructure and attractions, and benefiting from property renovations in their markets. Many of these locations are winning significant new business by serving as interesting regional alternatives to major destinations. Additionally, many smaller cities are on planners’ rotations designed to vary destinations from one year to the next, and many of these events have been growing, bringing more attendees and budget. \nSeveral smaller cities have emerged on the 2015 list such as Pittsburgh, PA; Jacksonville, FL; Tucson, AZ and Charleston, SC, which displaced Carlsbad, CA; Newport Beach, CA; Chandler, AZ and Alexandria, VA in the Top 50. Within the list, cities including Austin, TX; Charlotte, NC and Tampa, FL climbed to higher positions, while markets near major cities like Fort Worth, TX and Coronado, CA slipped in the ranking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T22:45:50.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
