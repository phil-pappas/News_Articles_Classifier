In fact, each year thousands of people travel the globe just to make a dive in a specific destination, which is often selected for its natural beauty or unique properties. \nIf you're already a diver, you probably are aware of PADI , the Professional Association of Dive Instructors. The organization helps to certify SCUBA instructors across the globe, while also offering suggestions for the top dive shops and locations from around the planet . PADI is also instrumental in the promotion of the sport, helping to educate the general public about SCUBA diving in general, while also offering PADI certified courses to help divers improve their skills and earn their various certifications. Now, PADI is looking to support women diver's everywhere with a day dedicated specifically to them. \nSaturday, July 18 marks the first ever PADI Women's Dive Day , which has an expressed goal of raising awareness of SCUBA diving amongst women, while getting as many female divers into the water as possible. To that end, there are a number of special events being planned to celebrate the day in just about every corner of the planet. \nAccording to PADI, there are currently events scheduled to take place in 60 different countries on 6 continents, with the potential for the celebration to extend to Antarctica as well. Nearly 300 dive-related activities are planned at the moment, with everything from standard dives to beach clean-ups, and even special speaking engagements all on the docket. Additionally, dive shops will also be offering discounts and special gear tests to encourage more ladies to pick up the sport as well. In fact, there are so many things happening that PADI has even created a special database to help divers find events that are taking place near them. \nOf course, Women's Dive Day is also a way to encourage anyone who is interested in getting SCUBA certified to pursue that ambition. PADI provides all the information necessary for both men and women to get the training that they need by taking proper courses. Earning that certification isn't as difficult as you might think, and it is a good way to open the door for new adventurous possibilities for travelers. \nSo just what kind of activities can we expect for Women's Dive Day? Multiple locations will be spotlighting their exceptional shark dives, with places like Cat Island in the Bahamas and Isla Mujeres in Mexico standing out for being amongst the very best in this category. The latter of those destinations provides visitors with pristine reefs and steep walls, which make it a haven for tiger, reef, and nurse sharks, while the latter has one of the largest concentrations of whale sharks found anywhere in the world. Other places hosting female-only shark dives include Wilmington, North Carolina; Tiger Beach in the Bahamas, and Cocos Island in Costa Rica. \nShark dives are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the events that are being held however. Other sites are offering two-for-one specials on select dives and re-certification courses, while the History of Diving Museum in Islamorada, Florida will be using many of its displays to spotlight the impact that women have had on SCUBA diving over the years. Other places will offer discovery dives to introduce ladies to the sport who have been interested in getting started, but would like to give it try first. In short, there is just about something for everyone of every experience level, and including both divers and non-divers alike. \nOf course, this wouldn't be an event for the 21st century without at least some social media integration. PADI is encouraging any ladies who are taking part in the event to share their stories and experiences using the hashtags #PadiWomen and #PadiWomensDiveDay. If you can't join in on the festivities yourself, perhaps you can follow some of the fun on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I'm sure there will be plenty to see and do. \nWhile this is the inaugural PADI Women's Dive Day, the organization is hoping that it will be a big enough success that it can be continued in the future as well. Considering the large number of events that are scheduled to take place, that seems like a fairly safe bet at this point.
