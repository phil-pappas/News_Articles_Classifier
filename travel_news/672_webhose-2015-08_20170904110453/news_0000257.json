She completed a BSc in materials science and a PhD in metallurgy at Imperial College London before joining British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) in 1979 and later becoming its chief technology officer. She now chairs the EU’s Euratom Science and Technology Committee and the UK’s Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board (NIRAB). I was lucky to have a really innovative chemistry teacher who encouraged us to look beyond the narrow academic syllabus. We touched on anything from metallurgy to ophthalmology, and I discovered that a materials science degree would let me go on studying chemistry and physics, both of which I loved. I wasn’t worried about being shrivelled by radiation. People who work in the nuclear industry soon learn to be realistic about the risks. There was a time in the Eighties post-Chernobyl when it seemed better not to tell people at parties what I did. But attitudes have changed hugely. Now that we import much of our fossil fuel people realise the vulnerability of our electricity supply and they’re more likely to accept the value of nuclear energy. You still have to be a bit of an evangelist but it’s a pleasure to engage with people who have open minds. The sheer breadth of the nuclear industry makes it very exciting. It ranges from new builds, new reactor designs and fuel manufacture to decommissioning, environmental remediation and health and safety. I began my career in fuel production and moved into sales and marketing, where I led BNFL’s successful bid to supply fuel to Sizewell B, worth tens of millions of pounds. I was special assistant to the chief executive, which was a real eye-opener, and eventually chief technology officer with an annual R&D budget of more than £100million. A senior position can open a lot of other interesting doors. I sat on the Council for Science and Technology which reported direct to Tony Blair, so I was able to influence government policy on the future of nuclear power. I almost wish I could begin my career again, because the nuclear industry is entering one of the most exciting phases for years. Almost all the UK’s existing capacity will be shut down in the next decade and replaced with a new generation of reactors. There’s a real buzz in the industry again, with much younger people popping up at conferences and a lot of supply chain companies keen to become certified. The industry was very male when I joined, but I’ve never experienced any negative gender issues. Engineers are much more interested in your qualifications and whether you’re any good. What I did find was a generation gap – with a shortage of people in their thirties and forties you could be promoted very quickly. The same is often true today, so the prospects for new recruits are very good. Grab every chance you can to do something different – that’s my advice to people starting their careers. That could mean being secretary to a committee, which is a great way to learn from discussions between much more experienced people, or taking a course in public speaking. Your career will be what you make of it.
