Thome | Aug 05, 2015 Adv: \nAs British Airways exits Uganda in October, Brussels Airlines will have changed tack and will offer nonstop flights between Brussels and Entebbe when the new winter schedule will commence on the 26th of October. \nOperating as SN 465 every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, the previous stop in Kigali will be cut out saving passengers a good hour and a half on the inbound flight to Entebbe. Passengers dumped by British Airways into the market, as a result of their withdrawal, will be able to connect to several UK destinations via Brussels with a short transit time there after arriving from Entebbe. As an added benefit, immigration processing queues in Brussels are normally much shorter than in London Heathrow which has gained notoriety long waits. \nHowever, Brussels Airlines has also added the option to join one of the two flights out of Kigali, which will also begin to operate nonstop on Sundays and Wednesdays effective from the 26th of October. This is going to be possible through a code share arrangement with RwandAir which will fly passengers from Entebbe destined to Brussels and beyond on their daily evening flight WB 435. From there they join SN 451 after a short transit time in Kigali. \nThis gives Ugandan passengers at least five flights to Brussels every week. No doubt, it will benefit not only the customers of Brussels Airlines but also the holders of StarAlliance frequent flyer cards as they can earn miles even when travelling via Kigali. \nBrussels Airlines sadly will have to pass over the connection to Nairobi, Kenya to their senior partner Lufthansa after decades of uninterrupted service. The 24th of October will be a tearful good bye when the last Brussels Airlines flight takes off from Nairobi to Brussels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:10:37.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
