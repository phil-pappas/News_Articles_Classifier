His life was under constant threat after killing of the LeJ leadership in a police encounter. Khanzada did not let this stop his routine meetings with people, and in the end, he became the victim of a suicide attack. \n“We told late [the] Home Minister to suspend his routine meetings with people and stay … as much as possible, but he never cared, and said that nobody could change the date of his death, [so] why … be worried or afraid of [it],” said one of his former security officers while talking to Dispatch News Desk. \nAn initial police report and information gathered by injured persons indicated that suicide bombers stood near pillars of a shed under which the minister was sitting with over 50 persons and detonated themselves resulting in the entire roof caving in and causing the death of the minister, his police guards, and 12 other persons. \nChief Minister Punjab Mian Shabaz Sharif attended the funeral of Khanzada and Deputy Superintendent Police (DSP) at Attock, along with police lines on late Sunday evening. The Punjab government announced three days mourning over this tragic incident. \nThe reports about Shuja Khanzada’s death were confirmed by the advisor to Chief Minister Punjab, Dr. Saeed Elahi, saying that the body of the provincial home minister had been retrieved from the debris. He was the man behind of arrest of hundreds of top Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) terrorists in Punjab, and he was a focal person in contact with top intelligence agencies of the country and always took action on tip offs without delay. His life was under threat, and he had prior knowledge about a possible attack on his life after the killing of the chief of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), Malik Ishaq, who was killed in a police encounter. LeJ and TTP operate hand-in-hand, and LeJ is also on the list of terrorist organizations released by the Department of State of the United States. \nDSP Shaukat ShahDSP Shaukat Shah was also known as a brave police officer who was killed along with Khanzada in the suicide blast. He lived and was educated in Rawalpindi. \nMeanwhile, the sources in the interior ministry have claimed that that banned outfit Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) has taken responsibility for the suicide attack on Shuja Khanzada.
