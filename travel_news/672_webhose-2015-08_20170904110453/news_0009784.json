In fact, you might have missed the most monumental week in years, a week that showed unprecedented volatility and, perhaps more importantly, eye-popping frailty of the entire equity asset class. \nWe traveled about 10,000 Dow points up and down for the week in total, a roller coaster that simply isn't healthy, no matter if it ended pretty much where it began. \nAmazingly, each day packed a punch and each day yielded lessons that must be learned if you are going to take advantage of an opportunity and protect yourself from both the vicissitudes of the market and the weakness of mechanisms that control stock trading. \nMonday, in many ways, shocked me and I am a pretty grizzled veteran. I certainly expected weakness at the opening, given that China reported a hideous industrial number over the weekend. We have been in the grips of the Chinese bear , given that the second most important economy on earth is experiencing a remarkable slowdown and the stock market, after rallying furiously for almost nine months, has simply fallen apart. \nMust Read: 4 Stocks Carl Icahn Loves in 2015 \nWe were still reeling from the end of last week where the Dow fell more than 5% in two days with Friday's 3% decline, caused in large part because St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard's oddly timed interview on Sirius radio, where he said he was sanguine about the financial markets and that rate hikes were required, regardless of Chinese turmoil. \nGiven that many professionals are frightened to death that the Fed is blind to what's happening in Japan , and many individuals were shocked by the gigantic losses they had experienced the week before, we expected selling at the opening. \nBut we didn't get just selling, we got a flash crash with the Dow opening down 1,089 points, reminiscent of the flash crash of 2010 where the Dow dropped 998 points in 36 minutes, although that plummet came from around the 10,000 level, so it was a much bigger deal than the 16,459 perch we fell from Monday. \nBut it was just as scary. I saw CVS ( CVS - Get Report ) open down 25 points, Celgene ( CELG - Get Report ) declining about 25%, GE ( GE - Get Report ) losing a fifth of its value and Apple ( AAPL - Get Report ) at $92, down $13 from $105, a very big deal for the world's biggest company, just to name a few of the travesties that popped up on our screens. \nIt was unnerving, to say the least, and so clearly a breakdown that it shouldn't have just been called off and all trades broken. But if you used a market sell order, you got those horrendous prices, horrendous because they all snapped back to within a couple of percent from where they went out Friday. So, first lesson , never use market orders. A sell order with a limit could have kept you from getting those nasty reports. A buy order with a limit put a couple of points above those prices and you would have crushed it with some terrific buys. You need to see both ways. \nNot only that, had you been paying attention to CNBC, you might have heard a story I broke about how, unlike much of the conventional wisdom, Apple's iPhone business in China has been very strong since the last quarter ended and had accelerated in the last two weeks. Apple typically doesn't give a mid-quarter update, so the news took the stock from deep red to the black, an amazing 17-point increase; again, something that every trader had a possibility of getting, if you just paid attention to the news. \nBut then the market just plain gave up the ghost with an incredible wave of sell orders upon sell orders overwhelming the system, causing five different firms to have to suspend their businesses.
