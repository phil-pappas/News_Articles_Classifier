YAWN - Montgomery Advertiser Published: 8/8/15 2:38 pm EDT - Updated: 8/8/15 2:40 pm EDT \nMONTGOMERY, Alabama â€” It's not often that one family's vacation sparks city-wide pride at their destination, but then again, Taminika Walker didn't take her nieces on any ordinary vacation. \nTaminika Walker, an English teacher in Tyler, Texas, had a family reunion planned in New Orleans for the end of July. A month before that, however, she decided she was going to take her nieces on a vacation following the reunion. She had only taken one of her nieces on a trip before - to Tennessee - and Walker wanted to take them all somewhere she had been before. Somewhere with history to learn from and fun still to be had. \nWalker decided to take them to Montgomery. \n\"I wanted them to see the civil rights history,\" Walker said. \"And besides the educational part I wanted to find some fun things to do.\" \nWalker's goals were simple. She wanted to visit the important historical sites, only eat at local non-chain restaurants, and experience the fun the city has to offer. She couldn't have known that by the end of the week, she would be called \"family\" by Montgomerians and eat lunch with the mayor. \nIt all started with a bus. \nWith an eye for budgeting, Walker and her four nieces left New Orleans on a Megabus on July 27. Once in Montgomery, they continued to ride solely on the city buses. \nAfter resting from their journey on July 27, the five kicked off the trip with a visit to the Rosa Parks Museum. They then went to paint and eat cool, summer treats at Nancy's Italian Ice, but that's when the week took a turn for the better. \nBarbara Grimes was teaching art at Nancy's when she met the family. They all spoke after and Grimes was touched by the family's pure intentions of having a fun, educational and frugal vacation. And she was simply smitten that they chose to come to Montgomery. \n\"They took a Megabus and came to Montgomery without a car,\" Grimes said Thursday before the family departed. \"Can you imagine traveling without a car for four days? And to rely on the city bus?\" \nGrimes couldn't. She decided to become their personal tour guide and to drive them places so as not to waste time. \n\"I've adopted them,\" Grimes said. \"They're my new family.\" \nGrimes showed them the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, and ended the day by playing in the sand by the river and watching the sunset. \nGrimes posted pictures of her day to her Facebook along with a story detailing how she met her new family and it spread like Italian ice on a hot summer sidewalk. \n\"I just wanted to share their story,\" Grimes said. \"I had no idea it was going to get this much attention. I was just sharing how we need to reach out to people that are visiting Montgomery. We need to show Montgomery.\" \nNot only did her Facebook friends \"like\" and \"share\" the story - 373 times collectively - but the story was eventually emailed to Mayor Todd Strange by Grimes' good friend, Stephanie Stone, on July 30. Montgomerians were finding out how much they loved their city by sharing it with a humble stranger, and Strange wanted to make the vacation as special as possible. \n\"See if they are still here,\" Strange emailed on the last day of the family's vacation. \"We can pick them up. Have to act fast.\" \nThe whirlwind week ended with a lunch with the mayor at Chappy's Deli, another local restaurant, and Taminika and her nieces could not be happier. \nAlso in attendance was Paige Morrow and her friends and her children. Morrow had seen Grimes' post and felt touched by Grimes' welcoming heart. \n\"I was just really touched by the way (Grimes) opened herself up to these kids,\" Morrow said at the lunch. \"I just wanted to meet them today before they left and tell them how happy I am that they came to our city.\" \nBefore July 30, Walker also managed to take her nieces to the Archives, the zoo, the ice skating rink and other local attractions. \nAttractions Mayor Strange doesn't want locals forgetting about. \n\"They took public transportation to all of the great events,\" Strange said. \"They took the tour that people who live in Montgomery need to be taking.\" \nGrimes agreed that local attractions are underappreciated by those who live close by. \n\"We take our city for granted,\" Grimes said. \nWalker and her nieces do not. \nTen-year-old Arbany Johnson enjoyed the Rosa Parks Museum the most. Ronjenae Richards, 13, loved the zoo. Six-year-old Laycie Clark had the most fun ice skating and Alyieh Johnson, 8, loved going to Chappy's with everybody most of all. \nOn July 30, Walker and her four nieces got back on the Megabus that brought them to the Alabama capital having spent only approximately $300 while taking in every sight they could find using only public transportation to, from, and in the city. \nThe money saved by Walker on this family vacation is remarkable enough, in addition to the number of sights she saw. Her favorite moment, however, was the beginning of her family's friendship with Grimes, and subsequently, with the city. \n\"My favorite was Nancy's Italian Ice,\" Walker said. \"It was great to watch them create art and build a friendship with someone new.\" \nAlthough their time spent together was short-lived, Morrow hopes these won't be the last tourists embraced by locals. \n\"I just want us to be a welcoming city,\" Morrow said. \"I hope they felt welcomed and enjoyed their time here.\" \nInformation from: Montgomery Advertiser, http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T21:59:11.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
