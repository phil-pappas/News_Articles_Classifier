The National Park Service announced Tuesday the neighborhood redeveloped in the mid-20th century featuring the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and three other sites nationwide are being added to the list of historic landmarks. Lafayette Park is a racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood consisting of townhouses, two high-rises and a shopping center that's next to a park of the same name. More than 2,500 sites compose the list of national historic landmarks. The park service typically adds five to 10 new sites annually. The National Park Service says in a statement that the designation recognizes places with \"exceptional value and quality\" that exemplify U.S. heritage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:58:55.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
