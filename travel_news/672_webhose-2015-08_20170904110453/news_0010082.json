Please train your bears to be where guests can see them.” \nNow while the comment could be a joke, the reality is that bears not being sighted is not a good thing. Previously bears were drawn to the developed area and roadsides of the park thanks to food left out for them as well as garbage and unsecured groceries. \nThe park then initiated a bear management programme in 1970 to reduce bears’ access to human food and trash. It seems the programme is working as intended, which is good for the bears and probably good for the tourists as bears are still, after all, wild animals.
