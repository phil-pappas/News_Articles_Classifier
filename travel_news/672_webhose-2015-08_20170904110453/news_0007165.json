The Big Agnes Rattlesnake SL3 mtnGLO tent weighs 5 pounds, 4 ounces when packed up, making it a reasonable weight to stuff into your backpack. The tent sleeps thee adults (snugly), but two adults and a child have worked fine in my tests. It’s good for three seasons and features a two-door/two-vestibule design, so campers aren’t on top of each other constantly. A Quick Stash area on the tent body door makes stowing the unzipped door simple, so you can focus on enjoying yourself.
