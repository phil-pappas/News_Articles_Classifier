He was previously the director general of the Office of SME Promotion and president of the National Food Institute. An economist by training, he graduated from Thailand's Chulalongkorn University and Japan's Keio University. \n\nThe new TAT chief has announced in a press statement plans to immediately introduce three strategies upon taking office, including reassuring global confidence and stimulating domestic tourism in the wake of the recent bombing, as well as creating a better TAT. \n\nTo maintain global confidence, Yuthasak reiterates that TAT’s domestic and overseas offices are providing regular updates on the 'business-as-usual' situation in Thailand. In December, TAT will organise a major event to draw tourists. \n\nPromoting year-round domestic tourism, especially for students and senior citizens, will also be a top priority for the incoming governor. \n\nYuthasak added that he plans to build upon TAT’s strong foundation, to improve cooperation among government agencies, private sector and partners abroad, and to streamline internal procedures to upgrade the operational efficiency of the TAT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:53:45.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
