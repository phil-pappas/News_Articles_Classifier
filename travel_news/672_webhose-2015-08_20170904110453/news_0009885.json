Or that the marbled lungfish has a genome 20 times the size of yours? Or that the kidneys filter 180 litres of blood each day? These are just some of the vast number of facts that I’ve assimilated in my first year studying medicine at Merton College, Oxford. I wasn’t always sure I wanted to be a doctor. There are no medics in my close family and few people from my school, a comprehensive in north London, went on to do medicine. And when I researched what I needed to gain a place at medical school I was shocked by how competitive it was – there are about 10 applications for each place. • Top 10 universities to study medicine • How to get into medical school Then the Telegraph decided to track my progress and my first assignment* was to talk tactics with the experts, with admissions officers, lecturers, medical students and doctors. I learnt that a requirement for top grades in the right subjects was non-negotiable, but there was so much more I could do to help my cause . I was quietly confident that if I got a typical [non-Oxbridge] offer (AAA), in biology, chemistry and maths, then my exam results would not let me down. The real challenge was making my application stand out from the others who would get those grades too. The right work experience was a crucial factor. I was already volunteering with Age UK, but I needed something hospital-based and I secured a placement at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. It was there that my eyes were opened to the frenetic, thrilling life of a clinician. I spent time in ICU and the renal unit but it was in the emergency department that I saw everything from broken wrists to overdoses, sepsis and cardiac arrests. From then on I knew that medicine was the only course for me. With this in mind, I worked hard crafting my personal statement, focusing on my work experience, my (newly awakened!) interest in health news and NHS politics, and my hobbies. I applied to four medical schools and got interviews at two of them, Bristol and Oxford. I came out of both feeling drained and confused. Oxford was particularly surreal: I was asked to explain why the theory of evolution was the best explanation for life as we know it. (With a little help from my interviewer, I blurted out a barely understandable answer about shared DNA across species.) Most medical schools use the UK clinical aptitude test (UKCAT) Photo: Alamy I was pessimistic but in January 2014 I got an A*AA offer from Oxford. After that, it was head down to make the grades. Just over a year ago I learnt I’d done it (A* in maths and biology and A in chemistry and geography). The realisation filled me with relief, excitement and terror. I was warned how difficult it would be and in those first few weeks away from home I began to doubt I could cope. The ancient house I had a room in may have been beautiful, but all I felt was the weight of history and expectation. But, like most other freshers, when I got to grips with university life, I felt I really did belong. The workload was a shock. A typical day would consist of up to four lectures, with three practicals per week. And then there was the dissection room. I’d never seen a corpse before but soon I had an intimate knowledge that no text book could match. Tutorials in which we were assigned essay questions such as: ''Discuss the role of domain structure in the evolution of protein diversity’’ proved a challenge – it helped if you understood the question. \"Study had to be accommodated alongside the excessive socialising that dominates the first term.\" Of course, study had to be accommodated alongside the excessive socialising that dominates the first term. It’s tempting to sign up to every society at Freshers’ Week. I knew I’d never take to underwater hockey, but I did join the MedSoc. A highlight was the gold and glitter themed Christmas Ball at Blenheim Palace. Long nights of study followed by early morning lectures were tough: and I wouldn’t recommend dozing in the front row at a lecture on poor posture unless you want to become part of the demonstration. Trinity term started with the legendary summer balls, but culminated in the coffee-fuelled weeks leading up to seven exams. At the end of the last one, the tradition of ''trashing’’ (being covered from head to toe in anything from champagne to fish sauce) came as a welcome relief. Medical school has been the best decision of my life so far. Getting in is tough, and once you’re there it remains tough but the rewards make up for it. Learning about the human body is endlessly fascinating while medical science and its applications are enthralling. And at the end there is a fulfilling job, a huge number of specialities to choose from, and the chance to save lives. It seems an age since I arrived at Oxford, naive, scared, and uncertain. But my second year fills me with excitement – because it takes me a step closer to my dream. Interview tips for would-be medics • Research what type of interviews your chosen medical schools conduct. Sample questions may be available on the websites and you can rehearse with parents, teachers or friends. • When you walk in to the interview room, smile and say hello. • Take a bottle of water to prevent a dry throat (plus a quick sip can buy time with a tricky question). • Keep up to date with medical current affairs and clinical breakthroughs. Know who the Health Secretary is. • Be familiar with the British Medical Journal and The Lancet and read popular science books to illustrate a broader interest. • If you really cannot answer a question, don’t try to blag it. Stay calm and tell the interviewer you do not understand the question or don’t know the answer – they will usually give you some clues or move on. • It’s OK not to ask questions when the interviewers say “Any questions”. But have three or four up your sleeve about the course or the school. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:31:01.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
