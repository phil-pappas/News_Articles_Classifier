The display marks the beginning of a busy international trade show schedule for the company. Quest is located in the main pavilion in Booth P103.\n“We consider China and Southeast Asia in general, to be the perfect market for an aircraft like the KODIAK. Its rugged versatility is well-suited to a variety of operations. We currently have 5 KODIAKs flying in China, and several more will be delivered in the next few months.”\nThe KODIAK Aircraft received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) in July 2013. The KODIAK’s multi-mission flexibility and efficiency are well-suited to this region, and several recent modifications to the aircraft only enhance its capabilities. These include an increase in the aircraft’s landing weight, FAA approval for a TKS Tank installation in the cargo pod and certification of a new executive interior and new avionics equipment.\nLate last year, Quest received approval for the integration of the Garmin GFC 700 Automatic Fight Control System (AFCS) in the KODIAK. Earlier in the year, the company received certification of the new Summit Executive interior. The top-of-the-line five-place interior features club seating, two fold-out tables and two easy-access storage cabinets. Customers now have a choice of three interior packages. Both the Summit and the Garmin Autopilot are available in new KODIAKs and can also be retrofitted in existing KODIAKs.\n“The enhancements we made in 2014 provide KODIAK operators with even more reliability and versatility,” added Zinda. “And we continue to work to provide additional performance and feature upgrades that appeal to a broad range of users.”\nKODIAKs are in operation around the world in key market segments including personal use, Part 135 operations, government, and humanitarian organizations. The KODIAK is certified in 18 countries, with several additional certifications imminent.\nThe KODIAK has the ability to land and take off from unimproved surfaces and is capable of working off floats without structural upgrades. The KODIAK can take off in under 1,000 feet at full gross takeoff weight of 7,255 lbs. and climb at over 1,300 feet per minute.\nQuest Aircraft Company is the manufacturer of the KODIAK, a 10-place single engine turboprop airplane, designed for STOL use and float capability. Headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho, the company was established in 2001 and began deliveries of the KODIAK in December 2007.\nSource:- Quest Aircraft", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:16:00.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
