The enterprise will be named SinoBritish Waterside Villages and will give British, Chinese and other overseas visitors the opportunity to experience each other’s cultures in outstanding locations and to develop friendships with individuals and families from other nations.\nThe London Group have recently made the first acquisition for this concept by purchasing Lakeview Country Club, a 30 year old Cornish holiday village for £12,500,000 and have obtained permission to extend the 100 acres into the largest and most desirable private waterside village in Britain. Lakeview (to be renamed Waterside Luxury Village, Cornwall) is located in the heart of Cornwall, Britain’s foremost holiday destination, and with the support of both local and central Government is hoping to open up to international markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:36:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
