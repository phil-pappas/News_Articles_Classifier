Today, the ruined neo-Gothic mansion is at the centre of the Alton Towers Resort, with four hotels and a water park as well as the famous rollercoasters. Following an accident on the resort’s Smiler ride in June this year , a Health and Safety Executive investigation is ongoing. All rides are now open except The Smiler, which will remain closed for the foreseeable future. What’s new The Enchanted Village hotel opened this year with accommodation in hobbit-style huts in woodland, plus children’s entertainment. The new Enchanted Forest Tree Top Quest features a challenging high ropes course and lower ropes and a zip wire. The new interactive Octonauts junior coaster at CBeebies Land features many favourite faces from the channel. • The ultimate guide to the UK's theme parks Thumbs up The state-of-the-art roller coasters. Despite the closure of The Smiler there is plenty to jangle the nerves, including Air, which suspends you upside down as you “fly” across the park, and Rita, which shoots riders from 0-100kmph in 2.5 seconds. Oblivion is a sheer drop into a black hole while Nemesis was once described as “The world’s most intense ride experience”; it’s not, but it’s still a blast as it throws you through twists and turns. • Great family days out from Birmingham There is excellent entertainment for younger children too. The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ride is a highlight, ending with a journey in a glass elevator. So, too, is Sharkbait Reef, a pirate‑themed aquarium with sharks, rays and seahorses. CBeebies Land is a huge hit with pre‑schoolchildren. Thumbs down The numerous funfair stalls, not included in the admission price and with steep charges. Food bought inside the park is expensive. The water park has little to offer children over 13. • 50 great days out in the UK Top tips Guests staying at one of the four hotels on site get two days’ park entry for the price of one. • Alton Towers Hotel: review Food is expensive so bring a packed lunch and take a breather in the beautiful grounds. Prices Adult £37.80; under-12s £34.20; families £32.85pp for up to six people (max two adults); under fours free (online).
