Summer is family vacation time, but it’s also the season that invites golfers to take advantage of bargain rates on a bevy of world-class venues.\nFor example, at Palmilla Golf Club, which reopened last April following a $3.5 million renovation, “dynamic pricing” enables players to take advantage of adjusted rates based on demand, availability and other factors. The club offers discounted rates as low as $95 for an 18-hole round on the first Jack Nicklaus-designed course built in Los Cabos. For a deluxe vacation, the 27-hole facility’s golf packages feature accommodations at the top-rated One&Only Palmilla resort hotel.\nAt Cabo del Sol, the well-established 36-hole complex with stellar designs by Jack Nicklaus (Ocean Course) and Tom Weiskopf (Desert Course), segmented pricing through Sept. 30 entices golfers with the best values of the year. For instance, from 12:30 to 3:20 p.m., green fees on the Ocean and Desert layouts are priced at $150 and $100, respectively. Rates drop to $115 and $75, respectively, after 3:30 p.m. Discounted replay rates are also available on both courses at Cabo del Sol.\nSummer season rates are a steal at Cabo San Lucas Country Club, home to the only course in Los Cabos with a view of the iconic sea arch at Land’s End. Through Oct. 31, the regular rate before 11:59 a.m. is $120. The club’s twilight rate (12 p.m. to 1:59 p.m.) is $85, while tee times after 2 p.m. on this challenging 7,238-yard layout are a bargain at $65. In addition, the club’s new lighted range, the only one in Los Cabos, is open until 11 p.m. from Monday to Saturday and has become the place for fun at night under the stars, with a lively full-service sports bar and restaurant available.\nAt Quivira Golf Club, renowned for its gravity-defying course that tiptoes along sheer granite cliffs at Land’s End, players can take advantage of attractive rates in three time slots through Sept. 30. The prime time (7:00 to 10:50 a.m.) rate to play this world-class, Jack Nicklaus-designed course is $195. Quivira’s mid-morning (11 a.m. to 1:40 p.m.) rate is $140, while the value-priced twilight fee, available from 1:50 to 4:00 p.m., is $115. Rates include all food and refreshments at the club’s four comfort stations. ‘Stay & Play Packages’ at Pueblo Bonito resort properties are also available.\nAll three Questro Golf courses in Los Cabos offer significant seasonal discounts through Oct. 31. Puerto Los Cabos, situated on the East Cape outside San Jose del Cabo, boasts a unique composite layout with nine-hole designs by Greg Norman and Jack Nicklaus. The 18-hole green fee at Puerto Los Cabos is $195, with a twilight rate of $135. Refreshments (free of charge) are served at a pair of on-course palapas.\nAt Cabo Real, centerpiece of a resort development with 3.2 miles of beachfront, an 18-hole green fee of $180 and a twilight rate of $125 are promoted on the club’s Robert Trent Jones II-designed layout, a superb layout that climbs from the beachfront into steep desert foothills.\nQuestro Golf’s Club Campestre (pictured above), located five minutes from downtown San Jose del Cabo and a local favorite, is a Nicklaus Design course chiseled into sloping desert terrain that offers exceptional value. In addition to an 18-hole green fee of $140 and a twilight rate of $100, Campestre’s ‘Super Twilight’ promotion is priced at $65 after 3 p.m., arguably the best bang for the buck in Los Cabos.\nAmong other amenities, green fees at all Los Cabos facilities include shared golf cart, practice balls and bottled water.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:42:25.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
