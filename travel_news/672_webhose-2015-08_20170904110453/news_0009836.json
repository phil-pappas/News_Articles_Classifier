On Monday, a judge will meet with Malaysian authorities and representatives of the French aviation investigative agency, known as the BEA. \nAir-safety investigators, including one from Boeing, have identified the component as a flaperon from the trailing edge of a Boeing 777 wing, a U.S. official said. \nFlight 370 is the only missing 777. \n“In the aeronautic community, there is no (doubt) on the issue of what the debris belongs to. We are all convinced that it belongs to this flight (370),” said aviation-security expert Christophe Naudin on France’s BFM-TV. \nHe said only three 777s have crashed since 2013, and the other two were in completely different locations. \n“One is in the United States, one in Ukraine, and this one in the Indian Ocean,” he said. \nUnder a microscope and expert eyes, the wing fragment that washed up on the beach of the volcanic island could yield clues not just to its path through the Indian Ocean but also to what happened to the airplane. \nAnalysts at the French aviation laboratory hope to glean details from metal stress to see what caused the flap to break off, spot explosive or other chemical traces, and study the sea life that made its home on the wing to pinpoint where it came from. \nEven if the piece is confirmed to be from Flight 370, there’s no guarantee that investigators can find the plane’s vital black-box recorders or other debris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T18:56:50.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
