Ms. Corbin, you may proceed. Amy Corbin: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Genworth 's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Our press release and financial supplement were released last evening; and this morning, our earnings presentation was posted to our website and will be referenced during our call. We encourage you to review all of these materials. Today you will hear from our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom McInerney, followed by Marty Klein, our Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared comments, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer period. In addition to our speakers, Rohit Gupta, President of our U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment, and Jerome Upton, CFO of our Global Mortgage Insurance division, will be available to take your questions. During the call this morning, we may make various forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. We advise you to read the cautionary notes regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release and related presentations, as well as the risk factors of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly Form 10-Qs as filed with the SEC. This morning's discussion also includes non-GAAP financial measures that we believe may be meaningful to investors. In our financial supplement, earnings release and investor materials, non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to GAAP, where required, in accordance with SEC rules. Also, when we talk about the results of our international businesses, please note that all percentage changes exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And finally, references to statutory results are estimates, due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements. And now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Tom McInerney. Tom McInerney: Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide a brief overview of the results for the second quarter, share progress against our three strategic objectives, and discuss the outcome of our strategic review. Our second quarter operating income of $119 million reflects solid performance from each of our three premier mortgage insurance businesses. Compared to the first quarter, loss ratios in the U.S. were flat and improved in Canada. Australia's loss ratio of 28% was higher than in the first quarter, but the first quarter's loss ratio benefited from the favorable impact of borrower recoveries. We still expect Australia's loss ratio to be within our annual expectations of 25% to 30% for the year. Long-term care earnings were negatively impacted by higher severity on new claims and lower terminations on existing claims; and life and annuity earnings were down sequentially, reflecting less favorable mortality than in the first quarter. Flow new insurance written was strong across our three primary mortgage insurance platforms. And during the quarter, both Canada and Australia were also active in the bulk market. As we expected, sales within the U.S. Life Insurance division continue to be challenged, because of the low interest rate environment, our lower ratings, as well as market uncertainty caused by our strategic review. We are evaluating and implementing several new product and distribution strategies, but we expect sales to be modest near-term in this division. Additionally, we continue to focus on reducing operating expenses in U.S. Life to bring them in line with our lower sales levels. Overall, we are encouraged with our second quarter results in our mortgage platforms and we remain focused on initiatives aimed at strengthening and improving U.S. Life division results. We continue to focus on achieving our three strategic objectives, which are to one, strengthen the mortgage insurance and long-term care businesses, two, simplify our businesses, and three, increase financial flexibility and strength. 1 of 15", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T19:33:12.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
