Chinese tour groups are pressing on with their visits despite Monday night's bomb attack at the Erawan Shrine.â€‰ (Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) - + The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) and tourism associations say they will join foreign travel fairs and organise international roadshows as planned following Monday night's bombing at the Ratchaprasong intersection. \nThis month and next, the TAT is still confirmed to attend two travel fairs in South Korea, one in Hong Kong and one in Japan, while the Association of Thai Travel Agents will organise roadshows in five cities in China. \n\"We'll use the fairs as venues to update potential tourists about the real situation in Bangkok and Thailand so they can understand the situation and not be afraid to travel here,\" said Srisuda Wanapinyosak, the TAT's executive director for East Asia. \nThe TAT is calling on all relevant parties to work together to restore foreign tourist confidence and show national unity to make it through this difficult time. \nIt has prepared information to respond to questions by international media and travel agents at the fairs and roadshows. \nUp-to-date information related to tourism security and cooperative measures will be provided to potential tourists. \nThe explosion at the Erawan Shrine has hurt tourism sentiment, and some tourists planning to visit Thailand may plan to cancel or delay their trips. \nThe bomb killed 20 people including Chinese and Malaysian tourists and injured 125. \nSince the bombing, 23 countries and territories have issued travel advisories for their citizens about travelling to Bangkok. \nThey are Hong Kong, Britain, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Canada, China, Denmark, the US, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Japan, Belgium, Singapore, Sweden, Austria, Malaysia, South Korea and the Netherlands. \nRonnarong Cheewinsiriamnuai, president of the Thailand-China Tourism Association (TCTA), urged Thai media not have too narrow a focus in stories related to the Ratchaprasong bombing. \n\"Media must report the facts,\" he said. \n\"We all realise the negative impact, but good things are still happening such as the kindness and assistance received from Thais. Such stories will help the country.\" \nMr Ronnarong said many Chinese media outlets translated local news and reports, so Thai media should be sensitive when reporting stories. \nIf they report only on the damage and show only pictures of the destruction, that will aggravate China, he said. \nThe TCTA surveyed its 200 tour agent members since the blast and found Chinese arrivals through them had not dropped off.
