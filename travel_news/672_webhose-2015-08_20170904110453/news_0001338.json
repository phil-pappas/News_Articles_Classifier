They vary in size though all have a comfortable bed, promise the UrbanCampsite Amsterdam founders.\nEvery year, the campsite is set up in different spot in or around the city.\nThis year's site is located in the middle of the \"IJmeer\" -- an artificial island next to Blijburg, Amsterdam's popular city beach.\nThere are showers and toilets, though guests need to bring their own towels and toiletries.\nAmenities include a fireplace, hammocks and small kitchen.\nThe campground will be open to guests until August 31.\nAll of the installations, most of which cost $96 per night, can be booked through Airbnb .", "external_links": ["http://www.urbancampsiteamsterdam.com/", "https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s?host_id=7110955"], "published": "2015-08-10T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T19:13:39.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
