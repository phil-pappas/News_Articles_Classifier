This is naturally one of Slovenia’s busiest months due to its warm climate, wealth of outdoor activities and exciting events, which this year included the Slovenia vs England UEFA Qualifying football match in Ljubljana, the capital. June also saw the launch of new flight connections between London Southend and Maribor (the country’s second largest city) which led to fantastic news coverage and travel trade attention.\nSlovenia has played an important part in the British travel industry in the last few years, hosting several travel trade events such as the 2013 Travel Network Group Conference at Lake Bled, followed by the flagship event for British travel trade: the 2014 ABTA Travel Convention.\nHaving noticed that the British travel market rarely focussed on Slovenia as a European destination, the national tourist board has worked hard to promote the country, often with very limited budget for advertising. The country’s constant presence in social media, travel trade media and national press (including in other English speaking countries) has helped build awareness about Slovenia, having previously been overshadowed by neighbouring countries. Yet Slovenia stands apart; often recognised as one of the safest countries in Europe, with diverse green landscapes, a wealth of outdoor activities and a welcoming atmosphere.\nTine Murn, Head of UK and Ireland communications, said:\n“We are extremely satisfied with the latest results and will continue to build our presence in the UK, which we strategically value as one of the core markets for Slovenian tourism. We believe Slovenia is a perfect destination for British holidaymakers with its stunning nature, incredible range of activities and rich culture – all only 2 hours away.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:06:05.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
