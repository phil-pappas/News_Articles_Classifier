Add to your style with matching umbrellas and raincoats in cheery colours. (Estee Lauder) \nWe dread stepping out wearing our prized fashion possessions during the monsoon, fearing that they may get ruined in the rain. But why dress down? Why not think smart and modify your wardrobe? Don’t let the rains play spoilsport, and opt for fuss-free outfits such as jumpsuits, dungarees, mini dresses and shorts. Add to your style with matching umbrellas and raincoats in cheery colours. Here are some style inspirations. \n(AP and HT Photos) Short cut Nothing can beat the cool quotient of a sexy pair of shorts (A la Kangana Ranaut, on extreme left). It’s fun and stylish, of course. Team it up with a crop top, throw over a sling bag and complete the look with Oxford shoes. \nStyle match Stylish raincoats are a great way to pep up your look when you step out. Go for bright colours as seen at Fendi’s runway (second from left), or the printed ones, which are much in vogue. For guys, too, matching your umbrella with your clothes is a good idea. Take a cue from the John Varvatos show (third from left). \nDoing denim differently Denim dungarees are a comfortable and trendy option. Pair your dungarees with a printed spaghetti or a crop top for some unbridled fun (photo, second from right). \nStyle is a block away Colour-blocking is a trend to look forward to this monsoon (just like our model on the extreme right). Go for short dresses with contrasting colours or colour-blocked heels. \nJump the style gun Fuss-free and stylish, ankle-length jumpsuits are ideal for rainy days. From sunshine yellow to hot orange and pop pink, go for colours that lift your spirit. \nGo androgynous Androgyny is a trend we swear by. Pantsuits in rich colours are a must have. This stylish outfit is a great choice for a formal outing. \nAccessorize with umbrella Umbrellas make for a perfect style-with-purpose accessory in the monsoon. Make a fashion statement by matching your umbrella with your outfit, or go for clashing prints.
