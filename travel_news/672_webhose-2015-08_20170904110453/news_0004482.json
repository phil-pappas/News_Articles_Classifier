The world's largest airline announced on Twitter Monday that it would no longer carry buffalo, elephant, leopard, lion or rhino carcasses. Spokesman Ross Feinstein said it's largely a symbolic gesture since the airline does not serve Africa but prohibits carrying such items on any flight. The first ban was initiated by South African Airways in April, followed by British Airways, Emirates and Lufthansa. Delta Air Lines, which has direct service to Africa, adopted a ban earlier on Monday. Last month American Airlines reported its most profitable quarter ever, after excluding one-time costs and gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T20:54:36.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
