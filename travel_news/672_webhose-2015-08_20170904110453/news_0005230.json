The upscale resort boasts 177 bright guest rooms and suites and fantastic sports and leisure facilities. \nThe hotel was designed to make full use of the region’s climate and includes three swimming pools, two of which are large outdoor pools, and calming water features throughout. Other leisure facilities include a sand sports centre, two tennis courts, and 11 padel courts. The hotel is also a short walk from the beach and is home to the indulgent Nagomi Spa offering a range of wellness therapies alongside an indoor pool, waterfalls, a Turkish bath and a sauna. Guests will have the opportunity to savour gastronomic delights at the award-winning Sollo Restaurant, or enjoy a la carte Mediterranean cuisine and tapas at Al Rolo Restaurant. For cocktails and snacks, guests can also head to the infinity bar terrace, located on the hotel’s top floor which houses an outstanding infinity pool and sky lounge with panoramic views over the Mediterranean Sea. John Greenleaf, global head, DoubleTree by Hilton, said, “Europe was introduced to DoubleTree in 2008 with the opening of the DoubleTree by Hilton Cambridge in the U.K., and since then we have opened more than 50 hotels across the region with now five in Spain. Travellers who have visited our city centre, resort and airport locations have come to count on our warm chocolate chip cookie welcome and signature service and we are looking forward to welcoming guests with DoubleTree hospitality on the Costa del Sol.” The Costa del Sol is one of Europe’s most renowned holiday destinations, famous for its sandy beaches, golf courses and subtropical climate, with 320 days of sunshine each year. One of the oldest cities in the world, and known to be the capital of the Costa del Sol, the beautiful Malaga is just along the coastline from the resort and is most definitely worth a visit. The city offers tourists a cultural and cosmopolitan vibe, shaping it into a great place to go in the Costa del Sol. Also, the resort itself is located 20 kilometers from Malaga International Airport, making it convenient for the millions of tourists who visit each year from Europe and further afield. Jose Navas, general manager, DoubleTree by Hilton Resort & Spa Reserva del Higueron said, “We are extremely excited to start welcoming guests to our hotel. Combining incredible views of the Mediterranean Sea along with first-class facilities and service, we are confident that the hotel will be a winning choice for guests aged 16 years or older wanting to take full advantage of the region’s climate and the hotel’s extensive leisure facilities.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T14:31:10.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
