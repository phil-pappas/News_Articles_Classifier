So why are partygoers not impressed? Warning: Nudity. Travel Updates Two unruly passengers restrained on Qantas flight into Perth by: What are these? Two unruly female passengers had to be restrained on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Perth before federal police boarded the aircraft. Source: News Limited \nTWO unruly teenage girls face a string of charges after they had to be forcibly restrained on a Qantas flight from Sydney to Perth before federal police boarded the aircraft. \nA Qantas spokesman said there were three disruptive passengers on board the flight on Friday and two of them, both 17-year-old girls, had to be restrained. \nNo crew or passengers were injured during the incident and the plane arrived on time. \nHowever, Australian Federal Police officers boarded the plane when it landed in Perth and escorted the two teenagers from the plane. \nA caller to 6PR, who said someone close to him was on board, said there was a “massive commotion” and the girls were “screaming” and “swearing” and had to be restrained with plastic handcuffs. \n“It appears that a member of the public got involved and assisted the flight crew, dragged the three people down the back of the plane,” he said. \nThe two girls face a string of charges relating to offensive and disorderly behaviour and failing to comply with directions. They appeared in Perth Children’s Court on Monday. \nOne teenager has been charged with failing to adhere to instructions about activities on board aircraft, offensive and disorderly behaviour on an aircraft, threats and false statements and failing to provide a name. \nThe second girl has been charged with failing to adhere to instructions about activities on board aircraft and offensive and disorderly behaviour on an aircraft. \nAn Australian Federal Police spokesman said these arrests are a timely reminder for the public to remember that when travelling on an aircraft within Australia, you are bound by Australian laws. “Unacceptable or violent behaviour will not be tolerated,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T10:48:36.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
