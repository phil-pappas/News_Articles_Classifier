Even a person taking statins to control their raised cholesterol levels can pay up to twice as much for their cover, it has been revealed. It is thought the increased premiums could affect tens of thousands of Britons. Experts said the increased charges are not justified by the cost of insuring those with higher levels and are ‘out of proportion’ to the actual risk. The higher cost is also at odds with life and health insurance policies, which people generally do not pay more for if they are taking statins. It is estimated more than half the UK population have high cholesterol and statins, the UK’s most commonly prescribed drug, are taken by hundreds of thousands to manage the effects. For most, raised levels should not have any significant effect on their risks of needing treatment while on holiday. But figures, obtained by The Times , suggest many of those with higher cholesterol can expect to pay double. In one comparison, a healthy 55-year-old on a week’s holiday in Turkey would be charged £10.42, but would have to pay £19.05 if they admitted having high cholesterol. Jules Payne, chief executive of Heart UK, told the newspaper the policy penalises people who have been responsible and had their health checked. “There is no reason why insurance premiums should be higher because of raised cholesterol that is being managed,” she said. “This penalises responsible people who are actually at lower risk than many others.” The British Insurance Brokers’ Association said premiums should be no higher for those controlling their cholesterol with statins or who have been told by their doctor they do not need them. Some insurers said the problem was partly as a result of trying to simplify online questionnaires.
