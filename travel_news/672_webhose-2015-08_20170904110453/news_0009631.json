Fifty-six percent of all respondents said they plan airfare and hotels and some activities in advance of their trips, but like to have plenty of unscheduled time to enjoy as they please. Sixty-one percent of women are these \"partial planners\" as are 52 percent of men. Twenty percent of men and 15 percent of women said the only pre-planning they do is booking hotels and airfare in advance, leaving all activities unscheduled.\n\"While most of us keep tight work, social and family schedules, when it comes to vacations we want to be more flexible,\" says John McCarthy , president, GO Airport Express . \"However, a significant number don't like to leave anything to chance.\"\nGO Airport Express, one of the oldest companies in Chicago , traces its founding to 1853 and the Parmelee Transportation Company, which provided a carriage service between Chicago's railroad stations and the downtown hotels. The GO Group LLC is the nation's largest airport transportation provider, serving some 60 airports in North America , Mexico , the Caribbean and Europe and transporting more than 13 million passengers per year.\n releases/more-vacationers-prefer-to-plan-rather-than-wing-it-300135467.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.airportexpress.com/", "http://www.goairportshuttle.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-vacationers-prefer-to-plan-rather-than-wing-it-300135467.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG90594&Transmission_Id=201508311559PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG90594&DateId=20150831"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:29:51.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
