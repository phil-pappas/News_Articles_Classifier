The question is just how long before the only place they exist is on the pages of a history book? \nTravel site Jetsetter has found 11 places that you need to go now, before it’s too late. \nThe Dead Sea, Israel \nTime is running out for this hyper saline lake, the saltiest spot on Earth, and a swimmer’s favourite thanks to its natural buoyancy. A vital resource for the region, the Sea is the sole feeder of the Jordan River as well as a major centre for health research. \nThe last four decades, however, have seen irreversible damage, as mineral mining from farmers and cosmetic companies continue to drain the sea of its rich resources. It’s lost a third of its contents — for proof, look to the former seaside restaurants and hotels, now isolated a mile from shore — and an even greater threat looms: sinkholes, appearing where the water has retreated, bringers of freshwater that dissolve even more salt from the land. \nScientists have determined that the coastline recedes by some 90cm per year, and give it 50 years before it’s gone for good. The Dead Sea is slowly shrinking.

Steadily rising ocean levels are poised to submerge the lowest nation on Earth within 100 years. \nHow serious is it? So much so that efforts are already in place to relocate citizens displaced by rising tides. The Maldives are under threat from rising sea levels.

While the Everglades will never completely disappear, the ecosystem is facing irreversible change for the worse. Alligators of the Everglades. AP Photo/Alan Diaz.

Not to mention pollution from industrial port development and outdated fishing practices, which continue to damage the sea floor and its marine residents. \nUNESCO spared the icon from an “in danger” listing this year, but warns that significant conservation progress must be made.

Scientific studies have determined that the snow and ice capping Africa’s highest mountain have been receding by 1 per cent a year since 1912, and that ice stopped accumulating in 2000. \nMelting ice exposes the mount’s dark-coloured soil, which absorbs more heat, causing glaciers to melt faster, and ... you get the picture. Kilimanjaro’s mountaintop ice fields have been an ultimate destination for climbers throughout the years, but, at the current rate of decline, no glaciers are expected to survive in 15 years.

Before dawn, even before the crowds descend, live tuna auctions are held — a sight witnessed only by a lucky few each day. \nBut by the end of 2015, your chance to see this landmark in its original location will be over, as it moves to Toyosu, across central Tokyo’s Sumida River, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Not to mention the building’s foundations are slowly sinking towards the Yamuna River. \nThere are rumoured plans to close the site to the public, reducing the palace — as England did with Stonehenge — as a place only experienced from afar.

A mere one metre rise in sea levels would put the city underwater — a reality that focuses not on “if” but “when.” Venice is facing a catastrophic rise in sea levels.

The best-preserved section, erected in stages during 14th through 17th centuries under the Ming Dynasty, still stands — but how long before it too gives in to the test of time? \nThe Congo Basin, Africa \nRainforests produce a large chunk of the world’s supply of oxygen. As they shrink, less carbon dioxide is absorbed, adding to climate change. Research reveals that two million acres are lost every year in the Congo Basin, the world’s second largest rainforest after the Amazon, due to illegal logging, ranching, mining, and civil warfare. \nAnd newly paved roads double as easy access routes for poachers to track down endangered species like mountain gorillas, okapis, bonobos, and forest elephants. If conversation efforts do not amplify, scientists estimate that up to two-thirds of the forest might be lost by 2040. The endangered mountain gorillas of the Congo.
