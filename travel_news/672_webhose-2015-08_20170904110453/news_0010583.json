The firefighters volunteered the labor and where helped with some donations including the Clubhouse decking and railings donated by Deceuninck North America. NICK GRAHAM/STAFF Soon, possibly this weekend, Barnett, who served two tours in Vietnam, will return to his Middletown residence thanks to the Middletown firefighters and a local business.\nWhen Debbie Barnett stepped out of her Roosevelt Boulevard house Wednesday morning, she was overwhelmed to see seven firefighters digging holes. She shed a few tears, and then said: “There are still miracles and good people in this world. Every one of them is going to heaven because they’re really, really good guys. I don’t have the words to tell them thank you. They’re amazing.”\nMiddletown Chief Paul Lolli said he learned about the Barnett’s situation after talking to Debbie, a longtime employee at the Applebee’s in Middletown. The firefighters agreed to build the ramp and use money they raised in their golf outing. That money is earmarked for local veterans.\n“It was a perfect fit,” said Lt. David VonBargen of the Middletown Division of Fire. “We are here to help people.”\nLolli then talked to one of his good friends, Scott Ricke, project manager for Deceuninck North America, based in Monroe. Ricke contacted the company CEO who wanted to add his assistance. The company donated the decking and railing, valued at $2,500 to $3,000.\nRicke said he was impressed by the firefighters and their desire to assist those in the community where they work.\n“That’s a great thing,” he said.\nLolli added: “This is what firefighters like to do best: build things and make it better for people.”\nThe project is expected to be complete by Thursday. What will her husband’s reaction when he sees the ramp?\n“He’s gonna cry,” she said. “When I told him he was so excited. He’s real determined to come home.”\nTrending on Facebook\n’LOL' instead of a tip. Waitress receives unwelcome note on receipt Oops!
