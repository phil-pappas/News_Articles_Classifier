The app suggests flight and hotel packages with the best value, allowing consumers to easily select and book a vacation in just two minutes. Need a larger room, or to fly at a different time? No problem. Travelers can easily customize their package, changing hotel, room type and flight according to their preference. And before they book, the app will show consumers how much they will save by booking the hotel and flight together. \nVacation packages are available on the Orbitz Android app and will be available on the Orbitz iOS app later in the month. Download the free Orbitz app now. \n“The focus across the travel industry has been on last-minute hotel bookings in mobile apps, but at Orbitz, we are beginning to see an expansion of how consumers are using their mobile devices,” said Chris Brown, chief product officer of Orbitz.com. “The launch of vacation packages in our app is so timely because consumers are no longer only using mobile devices for searching or making last-minute plans but are increasingly booking bigger trips requiring more advanced planning. Over the past year, Orbitz has seen a 100 percent increase in vacation package bookings on a smartphone through our mobile web site. On average, customers are spending nearly $1,700 on those packages and purchasing them almost two months in advance. We’re thrilled to now offer an app-based experience that makes booking a flight plus hotel vacation package easy and lightning fast.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T22:45:50.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
