But in recent weeks, Flanagan laid careful plans for retribution. He contacted ABC News about what he claimed was a story tip and filled his Facebook page with photos and video montages seemingly designed to introduce himself to a larger audience.\nOn Wednesday, Flanagan killed 24-year-old Alison Parker, a reporter for WDBJ, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, while the two conducted a live interview for the station's morning broadcast, then went online to claim that they had wronged him in the past.\nCommunity supporters light candles in the shape of a heart during a vigil for journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward who were killed during a shooting in Moneta, Va., Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015.

Flanagan accused a news photographer of trespassing on private property. He confronted an anchor over a story and attempted to reach the company's CEO to complain. He filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as the lawsuit.\nFlanagan's joking and smiling one minute could turn to anger in the next, a former colleague, Justin McLeod, said in an interview.\nOnce, seemingly out of nowhere, Flanagan told a photographer that he knew the man didn't like him because he was gay. The photographer replied by telling Flanagan that he had not even known, McLeod said.\nWDBJ-TV7 anchor Chris Hurst, right, hugs meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner during the early morning newscast at WDBJ-TV7, in Roanoke, Va., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015.

Former co-workers, surprised that he stayed in town after losing his job, passed him from time to time. They called them \"Bryce sightings,\" referring to Flanagan's on-air name, McLeod said. But none had any conversation with him, let alone confrontations.\n\"We are still at a loss to figure out what happened to him in those 2 ½ years,\" Marks said.\nOthers who crossed paths with Flanagan during that time, though, recalled a man who took offense easily.\nWDBJ-TV7 anchor Chris Hurst, left, comforts meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner during the early morning newscast at the station, in Roanoke, Va., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber) When Flanagan landed a job at a UnitedHealthcare call center in Roanoke after he was fired, he was usually boisterous and intense, notable for his loud laughter. So Michelle Kibodeaux, who worked with Flanagan, took note one day when he seemed quiet.\n\"I told him, 'You're being quiet today. The shoe's on the other foot.' He said, 'You don't know me well enough to judge me.'\"\nKibodeaux said when she turned to walk away, Flanagan tried to grab her by the shoulder, but she ducked under his hand.\nWDBJ-TV7 meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner, right, wipes his eyes during the early morning newscast as anchors Kimberly McBroom, center, and guest anchor Steve Grant deliver the news at the station in Roanoke, Va., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015.

Afterward, general manager Heather Fay told The Associated Press, she received a 15- to 20-page letter from Flanagan criticizing the staff for telling customers to \"have a nice day\" instead of \"thank you.\"\nWDBJ-TV7 meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner, right, talks about the antics of cameraman Adam Ward during the early morning newscast along with anchors Kimberly McBroom, center, and guest anchor Steve Grant, at the station in Roanoke, Va., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015.

While she had never received anything like it before, she said there was no indication the letter's author was contemplating a crime.\n\"I thought the guy had a lot of time on his hands,\" Fay said.\nWDBJ-TV7 meteorologist Leo Hirsbrunner, right, wipes his eyes during the early morning newscast as anchors Kimberly McBroom, center, and guest anchor Steve Grant deliver the news at the station in Roanoke, Va., Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015.
