Highclere, a Victorian pile by Charles Barry, who built the Houses of Parliament, has been home to the Herberts, later Earls of Carnarvon, since 1679. “You go into a dip in the drive and suddenly the house appears,” she says. “Capability Brown did that deliberately, those tantalising glimpses.” The house has exhibitions on Downton Abbey and the 5th earl’s Egyptian finds. Favourite place : “The Library; it’s a place of peace, with Robert Herbert’s 1730s book collection. We don’t have his 'great wheeled chair,’ sadly, but I love the desk with a letter-slit in the top: the letters were franked here in the castle.” The great outdoors: “The Six Sisters’ Walk, pairs of walnut trees planted by my five sisters and me, ends in a rose arbor dedicated to my mother. Every so often one of the trees dies: Don the gardener, who’s been here for 45 years, told me not to put them there, but I went ahead anyway. It’s been a battle but they seem OK now.” Fun for children: “In the Egyptian Exhibition in the cellars there’s an old staff scullery with a sink, and in the sink is sand, and in the sand are seven things you can dig for, with photographs from the 1910 excavations on the wall above.” Best view: “I like walking away from the castle and looking back over a field called Sheep Ley: you see the cedars silhouetted against the hillside behind.” Just one thing: “There’s an amazing 12th Dynasty stele (stone slab) in the Egyptian Museum from about 4,000 years ago. The inscription is about a Lord High Chancellor, wishing him well after his death. I think I’d have that.” • Britain's best stately homes The library at Highclere Castle Photo: Andrew Crowley; Amy Shore; Clara Molden; Rex Features Highclere Castle, Newbury, on the Hampshire-Berkshire border (01635 253204; highclerecastle.co.uk ).

For a full review, see telegraph.co.uk/berkshirehotels . Wilton House, Wiltshire 18th Earl of Pembroke The 37-year-old earl inherited Wilton 12 years ago and lives there with his young family. The south front and staterooms are probably by Inigo Jones, with 19th-century additions by James Wyatt, all built on the foundations of an abbey given to the Herbert family by Henry VIII. “We’re between the Nadder and Wylye valleys, but above the water meadows,” says the earl, “so they picked a good place 800 years ago.” The house is famed for its Double Cube Room and art collection. Favourite place: “The Upper Cloister around the top of the quadrangle: I spent hours there on my go-kart as a child. You get great traction on the carpet and then the back skids out on the wooden corners. I think I avoided most of the priceless Roman sculptures, but they’re quite chipped anyway.” The great outdoors : “After my father’s death I commissioned a turf maze in his memory. It’s symbolic and meditative, rather than a hedged maze, and it’s in a clearing just east of the Japanese water garden, surrounded by wildflowers. It’s not signposted: I wanted it to be a reward for people who went exploring.” Fun for children : “The adventure playground is older than me: you’d never be allowed to build it now; it’s about 40ft high. Families absolutely love it.” Best view : “Stand in the Double Cube looking towards the Great Ante Room and there’s a mirror reflecting the Van Dyck portrait of the family. The glass is old and ripply and you can’t see the frame, so it’s like looking through a window into the past. I only noticed it when we changed the route through the house.” Just one thing : “The house deeds, which hang in the Lower Cloister. One from Henry VIII grants us the lease and one from Edward VI grants us the land.” The Earl of Pembroke at Wilton House Photo: Andrew Crowley; Amy Shore; Clara Molden; Rex Features Wilton House, near Salisbury, Wiltshire (01722 746714; wiltonhouse.com ) is open until August 31, the grounds until September 13.

Chatsworth, Derbyshire 12th Duke of Devonshire The duke was 13 years old when his family moved back into Chatsworth, which he describes at that time as “empty, shabby and cold”. His parents slowly turned it around: his father converted the house and gardens into a charitable trust (the Devonshires pay rent) and his mother Deborah – one of the Mitford sisters – transformed the interiors and began her famous farm shop. “He was macro, she was micro,” says the duke, “they did a brilliant job.” Bess of Hardwick’s original Elizabethan house has undergone many transformations: much of the exterior is 19th century and the spectacular landscaping is by Capability Brown. Favourite place : “The Library, which is a public/private space in that visitors can look into it, but can’t go in. We use it quite a lot. It’s in what was the Elizabethan Long Gallery, with a 17th-century Antonio Verrio ceiling and books that reflect the reading taste of the 1830s: natural history, bibles, maps, philosophy.” The great outdoors: “There’s a place we nickname 'Cornus Corner’, a quirky wooden seat made by our domain supervisor David Spencer and surrounded by masses of cornus, which is a white shrub. It feels very private.” Fun for children: “My parents put in a maze with four entrances and only one gets you into the middle. I’ve often got lost in it, but if we raced I’d probably win. There’s also an 18ft Squirting Willow Tree fountain made of copper that shoots water at you, and a scary coal tunnel for heating Paxton’s Conservatory. The conservatory went in the Twenties but children still love going through the tunnel.” Best view: “At the south end of the gardens is the Pinetum and if you stand by the ha-ha, looking west, there are wonderful, epic views – as English as you get.” Just one thing : “One of the white pots made by Edmund de Waal as a site-specific sculpture; they are pure and hopeful, beautiful, gentle and good.” • Stately homes on the silver screen The Duke of Devonshire, who was 13 years old when his family moved back to Chatsworth House Photo: Andrew Crowley; Amy Shore; Clara Molden; Rex Features Chatsworth, Bakewell, Derbyshire (01246 565300; chatsworth.org ).

For a full review, see telegraph.co.uk/devonshirearms . Traquair House, Peeblesshire 21st Lady of Traquair Scotland’s oldest inhabited house (1107), with its rocket towers and spiral staircases, is home to Catherine Maxwell Stuart and her family. “I remember washing up in my mother’s tea room aged five or six,” she says, “until a visitor mentioned child labour.” Traquair was a Jacobite stronghold: it’s said that its “Bear Gates” – each topped by a heraldic bear – will open again only when a Stuart monarch is on the throne. It has medieval rooms, a superb textile collection and a priest’s hole. Favourite place: “The First Library (there are two!) from the 1730s, where the books are shelved thematically under painted panels of philosophers. There’s a double catalogue, too, one alphabetical and one by subject. The great outdoors: “The Yew Tree Circle is 1,000 years old: they’re a wonderful, entangled group, the remains of the ancient Ettrick Forest. They’re on the Woodland Walk. Fun for children : “Oh, I think the 12th‑century secret stairs that were used by priests to escape. The family became Catholic again in the 1650s and it was very dangerous. The stairs were hidden behind a bookshelf and you still can’t see them around the corner, so they’re perfect for jumping out and scaring people.” Best view: “From the drawing room on the first floor, looking up the quarter-mile lime avenue to the Bear Gates. Bears were the family symbol and were probably hunted here in the forest. Just one thing: “The 1651 Andreas Ruckers harpsichord, treasured possession of the 6th countess: we’ve even got the music she brought and a painting of her with it. It’s been restored to playing standard, so we have recitals twice a year.” • Stately homes: readers' tips Catherine Maxwell Stuart outside her home, Traquair House Photo: Andrew Crowley; Amy Shore; Clara Molden; Rex Features Traquair House, Innerleithen, Peeblesshire (01896 830323; traquair.co.uk ).

The 12th duke inherited unexpectedly and the couple embarked on the mother of all repair jobs. “We’ve redone everything, re-roofing, rewiring,” says Jane Percy, “we could die tomorrow and know it’s in a very good state.” She started work on the gardens in 2000 and has made them famous as “a contemporary pleasure garden” with a much loved, massively wonky Treehouse. Favourite place: “It would have to be the Treehouse. There are some places that just work; it’s somewhere you want to be. We want learning to be fun; it has swinging bridges and screens telling stories about bees and growing things. The great outdoors: “The Poison Garden, that’s my baby. I know a lot about poisons. Agatha Christie always annoyed me because she only ever used arsenic. We’re licensed by the Home Office to grow around 150 poison plants for educational purposes, including cannabis, ricin and strychnine. We’ve got three specialist guides and very high security, obviously. There’s a coffin for donations. Fun for children : “Bill Pye designed our Serpent Garden to be tactile: it’s got seven interactive features made of stainless steel and you can run your hands through the water. Children turn up to visit in swimming costumes. Best view: “If you climb up the hill behind the Treehouse there’s an incredible view from The Duchess’s Seat, which is hidden in woodland. You see this amazing vista with the river and the castle below. Just one thing: “Our new gates, which opened this week, are covered in silver birds, about 20 of them, all British. As you get nearer, more of them sing.” Jane Percy, Duchess of Northumberland, below right, who has created a 'contemporary pleasure garden’ at Alnwick Castle Photo: Andrew Crowley; Amy Shore; Clara Molden; Rex Features Alnwick Castle, Alnwick, Northumberland (01665 511100; alnwickcastle.com ).
