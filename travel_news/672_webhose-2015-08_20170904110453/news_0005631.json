Among other things, it would replace the 13 percent sales tax with a value-added tax of the same rate to increase to 15 percent within two years. Low-income Costa Ricans – about 40 percent of the population – would receive refunds using an electronic system.\nSolís also paid a visit to former President Abel Pacheco earlier this week in a courtesy call that observers dismissed as of little political importance, given that the elderly Pacheco has alienated most of the leaders of the PUSC party. In any case, PUSC already has fallen into disrepute with scandals that saw two of its former presidents arrested.\nCosta Rica’s former President Óscar Arias.\nLindsay Fendt/The Tico Times\n‘Dysfunctional democracy’\nAfter his meeting with Solís, Arias lamented that Costa Rica has become ungovernable because leaders, he argued, have a difficult time implementing their policies.\n“In this dysfunctional democracy that we have, it is difficult to achieve what you propose,” Arias said.\nHe also lamented the recent legislative alliance between Solís’ Citizen Action Party and the leftist Broad Front Party.\nArias said the country needs the confidence of investors – both internal and from abroad – in order to grow and continue to develop.\n“An alliance with a communist party does not generate that confidence,” he said.\nArias added that he was glad Solís disavowed his party’s alliance with one that many believe have aligned themselves with other leftist parties in Latin America and that find inspiration in the policies and philosophy of the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.\nThe Broad Front Party stunned Costa Rica’s political establishment by winning nine seats in the country’s Assembly in the 2014 elections , and some observers saw the PAC alliance with the leftist party as proof that the ruling party has a strong wing that harbors ideas in line with “ chavismo .”\nThe 2014 elections also saw a party other than PLN or PUSC take power for the first time in recent history.\nThough Solís and party founder Ottón Solís (no relation) were both formally members of the PLN, PAC came to power as an insurgent party made up of members from across the political spectrum, attracted by the party’s stand against the corruption that had created scandals for both major political parties in the recent past.\nThat anti-corruption stance aside, PAC has failed to become steady on its feet.\nCosta Rican President Luis Guillermo Solís, right, meets with the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, Luis Alberto Moreno, to talk tax reform at the presidential office in San José, on Aug. 11, 2015.\nEzequiel Becerra/AFP\nIn an opinion piece in the daily La Nación, columnist and former Editor-in-Chief Eduardo Ulibarri said the administration is suffering from Solís’ inability to turn PAC into a true institutional party after he was elected president.\nUlbarri blamed in large part PAC founder Ottón Solís, who he said was intent on maintaining the party’s “ethical purity.”\n“[Luis Guillermo Solís’ election] was the moment to make [PAC] into a modern political party with machinery, political philosophy, programmatic bases, stable leadership, opportunities for advancement and discipline. At the same time, it needed to develop its vocation for negotiation and governing,” Ulibarri wrote. “None of that happened, in large part because [Ottón] Solís presumed it would contradict the ethical purity to which he was obsessively tied.”\nThe result is a party that does not have the organization or coherence to govern as an established political party.\n“Citizen Action, as a party, never came out of the closet,” Ulibarri continued. “Its internal weakness was a bill that came due when [Ottón] Solís was absent for 10 months, when a vacuum formed that made it possible for the party virtually to be taken over by one of its wings.”\nAs if the pressure from his own citizens is not enough, President Solís hosted a visit from Inter-American Development Bank President Luis Alberto Moreno on Tuesday, where Moreno told members of the press that the waiting for fiscal reform in the country ought to be over by now.", "external_links": ["http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Expresidente-Oscar-Arias-Luis-Guillermo_0_1504449584.html", "http://www.nacion.com/opinion/columnistas/partido_0_1504449555.html", "http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Acuerdo-Frente-Amplio-sindicatos-PAC_0_1498650161.html"], "published": "2015-08-14T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:13:46.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
