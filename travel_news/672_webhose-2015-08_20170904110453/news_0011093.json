(Twitter Photo) \nWhen your dad is the most powerful man in the world (well almost), you probably have access to anything you could ever want. But sometimes, what you really want is a sweet little dress that’s hanging in your big sister’s closet. Sasha Obama was recently spotted sporting an embroidered blue frock that her older sister, Malia, wore earlier in 2015. \nSo, when Sasha's denim dress looked familiar, our fashion face-off senses were all tingling, obviously. And it turned out, in June, Malia, 17, wore the same design, which she accessorized with white Mary Jane flats and a sleek blown-out hair style, during a trip to Europe with her mom and sister. \nSee: The latest denim styles you can include in your wardrobe \nAnd the youngest of the US First Family, it seems was taking a page out of her big sister Malia's fashion lookbook when it comes to dressing like a fashionable teen. The 14-year-old wore this chambray summer minidress, as she returned to White House from a recent family trip. \n(Twitter Photo) \nShe paired this most 'I just got back from summer vacay' ensemble with lace-up sandals and a large white leather handbag. (If only our jet-lagged style were as put together as the teen’s.) \nSee: Sexy denim overalls + high waists = 1990s fashion is back in business! \nWhile both Obama girls looked equally stylish rocking the summery frock, we can’t help but think their fashion-forward mom, US First lady Michelle Obama would look just as great in the design, showing off those famously toned arms. (Here’s to hoping there is a three-way face-off in the future!) \nMeanwhile, folks on Twitter, loved the sibling fashion face off. Here's some of what they had to say. (Which is basically the same thing, fashion face off... sibling fashion face off...)
