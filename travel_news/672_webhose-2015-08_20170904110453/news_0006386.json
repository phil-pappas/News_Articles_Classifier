I stepped on a hornet. I rushed to the refrigerator and applied the cut side of a lemon for about 20 minutes.\nThe pain subsided, and there was no swelling or other residual effect from the sting. A friend had told me about a young child who had been stung about 30 times and was saved by the lemon remedy.\nA . Yours is the first report we’ve received on lemon being helpful against a wasp or hornet sting. We weren’t able to find research supporting this remedy, but we are glad it helped.\nSome readers like other wasp-sting remedies, such as applying the cut surface of an onion or a cloth dipped in cool witch hazel or vinegar. Chemist Eric Block, Ph.D., said onions contain enzymes that can break down the proteins in venom. Turkish beekeepers have been using onions (and other natural approaches) on bee stings for centuries (International Forum on Allergy and Rhinology, July 2014).\nMost Read Stories Man shot dead in South Seattle while on phone with mom Seattle company copes with backlash on $70,000 minimum wage Impressions from Day 2 of Seahawks' training camp Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's Costco purchases land in southeast Redmond for long-delayed project Q . I read that soy would prevent heart disease and osteoporosis, so I switched from cow’s milk to soy milk. I put it on my cereal and in my coffee every morning, and drink a glass at lunchtime as well. I also started using soy sausages and burgers instead of meat.\nThen I heard that soy is bad for the thyroid gland. I am hypothyroid. Can you tell me more about this connection? Should I give up my soy milk?\nA . This is surprisingly complicated. Rodent research suggests that compounds in soy may indeed disrupt thyroid function (Experimental Biology and Medicine, June 2013; Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, July 15, 2014). But research in monkeys shows soy does not seem to interfere with thyroid-gland activity (Menopause, October 2014).\nIn humans, experiments have been inconsistent (Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, February 2014). There are cases of newborn babies whose thyroid conditions worsened when they were fed soy formula (Pediatrics, September 2012).\nOur Guide to Thyroid Hormones goes into much more detail on diet, diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism. This booklet is available online ($3.99) only at peoplespharmacy.com . Moderating soy consumption might be prudent.\nQ . When I was in high school, I developed athlete’s foot from not drying my feet properly. My doctor back then told me to go barefoot for the summer. He said the sun would knock the infection out, and I would not have a problem.\nI went barefoot every chance I got. I got a beautiful tan while playing or just doing summer activities, and my feet were tanned, too. There was no more athlete’s foot bothering me, and I have not had athlete’s foot ever since.\nA. Athlete’s foot usually is caused by a fungal infection (Trichophyton rubrum). This organism, like most other fungi, loves dark, damp places, which is why it thrives between the toes.\nEliminating the darkness and the damp by going barefoot in the summer is an easy fix. Keep in mind, though, that going barefoot inside (in a shower room, for example) with an active case of athlete’s foot could spread it to others. Wearing flip-flops would be thoughtful.\nIn their column, Joe and Teresa Graedon answer letters from readers.
