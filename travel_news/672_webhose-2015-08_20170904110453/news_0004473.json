Good move as the UK’s burgeoning tech industry is facing an acute shortage of talent. A recent report from Tech City, the publicly funded, non-profit team that supports the industry, noted that the UK has one of the world’s strongest digital economies, with 1.46 million people employed in digital companies. There is now a growing range of options to choose from if you want to get ahead in this exciting sector. Here are a few tips to help you along the way. 1. Consider a computer science degree All the major universities offer degrees in computer science and you can get a good indication of how highly the courses are ranked from The Complete University Guide . Expect to study such topics as programming languages, software engineering, artificial intelligence, operating systems, databases, nature-inspired computation, concurrent computing, robotics and the theory of computation. Costs: Fees of up to £9,000pa for UK students. 2. Take a short cut While a degree is obviously a prerequisite in some areas of IT, when it comes to web development, short courses such as Makers Academy’s boot camp can be more flexible and able to respond more quickly to changing technologies than long-term, fixed university syllabuses. They will also have more emphasis on practical coding on a daily basis. With Makers, you can be ready for the job market within four months of starting your pre-course. Costs: Makers’ charges £8,000 for a full-time, 12-week course but there are various payment and discount schemes available. 3. Know your JavaScript from your Ruby The sheer number of programming languages can be baffling but, because of the constantly-changing nature of technology, understanding the logic behind the way they work is probably more important than worrying about which ones to master. JavaScript, perhaps the most popular programming language, is fast, powerful and supported in all browsers. Ruby on Rails, a web development framework that uses the Ruby programming language, has become increasingly popular over recent years and forms the backbone of some of the best-known web applications. Other widely used languages include Python, which is often recommended for beginners because of its clear syntax, C++ and Java. 4. Try a short course Attending a boot camp requires absolute commitment, so you might want to get a flavour of what coding is all about before enrolling on such a rigorous and intensive course. Consider a short introduction such as the two-day “Kick Start Coding” course offered by Learn to Code London . Short courses ranging from one day to a week are also on offer from a range of centres around London, for both absolute beginners and more experienced programmers. Costs: From around £400 per day. 5. Learn online There’s quite a choice when it comes to learning to code online. Codecademy , for example, offers completely free courses from as little as one hour in length, covering such topics as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and building an interactive website. At Code School , a free account will allow you access to 10 introductory courses, while a monthly subscription will give you unlimited access to the full programme. With Code Avengers , you can choose from 100 hours of courses with more than 1,000 coding tasks. Makers Academy is currently testing an online version of its full-time, intensive course, incorporating such features as pair programming (where two students work in tandem) and job placement for graduates. Costs: Some courses are free. Subscription services start at around $25 (about £16) a month. With the term “computer studies” covering such a wide spectrum of disciplines and interests at all levels, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. What counts is to be clear about your goals and if those are to hit the ground running as a junior web developer, choosing a boot camp such as those run by Makers Academy could see you on the fast track to a new career. • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:49:07.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
