In what will be the HBAA’s largest logistical event of the year, the Big Site Visit is an opportunity for venue and agent members to engage with each other, gain product knowledge and most importantly, raise money for the association’s chosen charities, Meeting Needs and the HBAA Foundation. \nMembers across the country have already taken to the initiative with great enthusiasm, with the goal to encourage agents to visit all the participating properties over the five-day event. To raise charity funds, member venues will submit prize donations for auction, resulting in one lot per site visit, each raising an anticipated amount of £100. The lots will be available for online bids from 5 October and will run until Christmas. All funds will be split between Meeting Needs and the HBAA Foundation, in support of the future and professional development of employees in the hospitality and meetings sector. Jacqui Kavanagh, chair of the HBAA says: “The Big Site Visit is a huge undertaking and one of the largest association activities of the year. The event will reinforce our ethos of ‘doing better business, and doing business better together’ and will help us meet our 2015 objective to retain and encourage the next generation within the industry.” Juliet Price, consultant executive director of the HBAA adds: “This initiative will benefit our members and allow them to build networks with respective venues and agents. It will not only raise a lot of money for charity, but open the doors to new business relationships, which has always been one of the major benefits of membership at the HBAA.” The Big Site Visit will be celebrated at the HBAA Annual Dinner on 14 January 2016 at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, where awards will also be presented to members, including the agency achieving the most site visits and the most innovative site visit.
