We are going to increase the number of tourists from 30,000 to 45,000. This means an extra 50 per cent,” Silva noted.\nShe said this work “represents” an “act of justice” for tourism in Amazonas by bringing modernity to this region through the cable-cars, which will transport guests “in a few minutes.”\n“These modern cable-cars are going to turn Kuelap fortress into a new site, into a Peruvian Amazonia’s new tourist route, and we have worked by putting our hearts into it, so we will inaugurate this new cable-cars next year,” she told.\nOn the other hand, President Ollanta Humala affirmed the system would be ready by 2016. The said means of transportation will enable guests to reach Kuelap in a 20-minute period instead of 2 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:22:49.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
