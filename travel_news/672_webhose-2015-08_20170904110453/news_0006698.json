Night-time walks and literary events will bring to life the site of Pompeii, starting from its Amphitheatre, which now houses the ‘Pompeii and Europe 1748-1943’ exhibition, to the House of Menandro and the small Odeion theatre. \nGrand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria, built on the ancient foundations of a villa designed for Emperor Augustus, sits on the clifftops of the Amalfi coast in Sorrento, with breath-taking views over the bay of Naples and Vesuvius. The hotel’s grounds are filled with Roman ruins that can be seen by the guests as they relax in the vast gardens, and provides the perfect base from which to explore Pompeii and the surrounding areas. Pompeii is just a 45-minute drive from Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria. It can also be accessed directly by private boat from the hotel’s jetty or on the new Campania Express train, launched in May 2015. Advanced booking for Evening Enchantment events in Pompeii is required.
