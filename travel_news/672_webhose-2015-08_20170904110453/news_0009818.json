August 31, 2015 08:00 ET Chanticleer Holdings Reminds All Interested Parties That Tomorrow Is the Final Day to Become a Rights Offering Shareholder of Record \nOwnership Deadline Is Tuesday, September 1, 2015 by 4:00 PM ET \nCHARLOTTE, NC --(Marketwired - August 31, 2015) - Chanticleer Holdings, Inc. ( NASDAQ : HOTR ) (Chanticleer Holdings, or the \"Company\"), owner and operator of multiple restaurant brands internationally and domestically, reminds shareholders and the investment community that in order to be considered a shareholder of record to participate in Chanticleer's rights offering, shareholders must own HOTR in their brokerage accounts by 4:00 PM ET on Tuesday, September 1, 2015, which is three trading days before the record date of Friday, September 4, 2015. \nThe Company also reminds shareholders that were unable to participate in last week's conference call, to visit http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/174287 and listen to the replay as the management team provided a business update and a review of its operations and growth strategy. A replay of the teleconference is also accessible by dialing (877) 660-6853. International callers may dial (201) 612-7415. Callers should use conference ID: 13617859. \n\"Like our last successful rights offering, this up to $10 million offering provides our shareholders an opportunity to participate in the next phase of Chanticleer's growth strategy. We strongly believe that allowing our shareholders the opportunity to purchase shares at these low levels not only benefits our shareholders, but also minimizes dilution and preserves our valuable Net Operating Loss Carry-forwards\", stated Mike Pruitt, Chairman and CEO. \"The offering proceeds will be used to close the Little Big Burger acquisition and to accelerate our Australian growth strategy, which should accrue immediately to our bottom line.\" \nMike Pruitt continued, \"We encourage shareholders that were unable to attend our conference call to please replay the webcast in order to get a clearer understanding of our growth strategy and what lies ahead for Chanticleer and its shareholders.\" \nThe rights offering will be made through a dividend in the form of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase one share of common stock per each share of common stock owned on the record date at an exercise price to be determined after market close today. The rights offering will also include an over-subscription privilege, which will entitle each right holder that exercises their entire basic subscription privilege in full, the right to purchase any and all additional shares of common stock that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering. Both the basic and over subscription privileges are subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among participants. All basic subscription rights and over-subscription privileges may be exercised during the subscription period of Tuesday, September 8, 2015 through 5:00 PM ET Friday, September 18, 2015 on a pro-rata basis. The Company may extend the offering up to an additional 30 days, at its sole discretion, in which case the offering would continue on a subscriptions first-in, first served basis, calculated on a daily basis with the potential for pro-rata allocation of shares among participants subscribing on the last day the offering remains open. \nSee below expected calendar:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:19:35.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
