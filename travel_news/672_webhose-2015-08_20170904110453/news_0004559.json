It is a unique opportunity for Leeds to showcase why it is open for business and a great place to invest, work and live to the airport’s 22 million annual business travelers. \nThe Leeds City Region advertisements at Heathrow highlight the benefits the region offers to businesses, including its strength as the UK’s largest manufacturing center and position as the largest financial center outside London. \nServing more than 180 global destinations, Heathrow connects to Leeds Bradford Airport with 3 daily services transporting over 141,000 passengers annually between Yorkshire and the UK’s only hub. \nChairman of the Leeds City Region Enterprise Partnership Roger Marsh OBE said: \n“Leeds City Region is the UK’s largest economic center outside London with the ambition to become the growth engine of the North, for the benefit of the nation. \nAttracting substantial new investment and developing trade links with markets worldwide is central to our plans so I’m pleased that Heathrow and the government are backing our region through this campaign. \nAs an important gateway globally for business, trade and tourism, Heathrow plays a key role in supporting our region’s prosperity and I welcome this opportunity to showcase our strengths to the millions of people who pass through the airport every week.” \nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “As the UK’s only hub airport, Heathrow is our front door for global investors. I hope that by encouraging them to visit and invest in Leeds, we can help to grow businesses and create jobs in the region.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:51:39.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
