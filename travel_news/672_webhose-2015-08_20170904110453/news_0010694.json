As previously announced, the Partnership is reviewing its accounting treatment for certain Indonesian withholding and value added tax payments for certain historical periods. As a result of its review to date, the Partnership believes that it may be necessary to restate its financial statements for the current and prior periods in order to adjust its accounting treatment for such withholding and value added tax payments. The preliminary results announced today and the data for the comparable historical period do not reflect the impact of these potential adjustments. It is possible that additional adjustments to the Partnership's financial statements may be identified as the Partnership completes its review. To the extent the Partnership is required to restate its financial statements, it will file amendments in due course.\nHighlights\nReported total time charter revenues of $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $7.5 million of construction contract revenues for the second quarter of 2014 Generated operating income of $18.7 million and net income of $16.3 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to an operating loss of $5.2 million and a net loss of $7.3 million for the second quarter of 2014; operating income and net income were impacted by unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments on the Partnership's share of equity in earnings of joint ventures in the second quarter of 2015 and 2014 Generated Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $16.0 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to $6.1 million for the second quarter of 2014 On August 12, 2015 , announced that the Partnership has agreed to acquire the entity that owns the floating storage and regasification unit (\"FSRU\") Höegh Gallant for a purchase price of $370 million from a subsidiary of Höegh LNG Holdings Ltd.

The GDF Suez Neptune completed a scheduled modification and dry-docking in the second quarter while the GDF Suez Cape Ann and PGN FSRU Lampung continue to serve in China and Indonesia , respectively. I am pleased the Partnership announced the dropdown of the FSRU Höegh Gallant . The expected completion of the Höegh Gallant transaction is in the third quarter. I look forward to closing this transaction and the growth in distributions it is expected to deliver .\"\nFinancial Results Overview\nThe Partnership reported a net income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 of $16.3 million , an increase of $23.6 million from a net loss of $7.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 . The net income (loss) for both periods was impacted by the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments mainly on the Partnership's share of equity in earnings of joint ventures. Excluding these unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $6.4 million , an increase of $10.0 million from a net loss of $3.6 million for the three months June 30, 2014 . Income tax expense was $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\nAll FSRUs were onhire for the entire second quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2014, the PGN FSRU Lampung was still under construction and had no time charter revenues. GDF Suez Neptune and GDF Suez Cape Ann were fully utilized during the second quarter of 2014.\nOperating income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $18.7 million , an increase of $23.9 million from an operating loss of $5.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 . Operating income was also impacted by the unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments on the Partnership's share of equity in earnings of joint ventures.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $16.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , an increase of $9.9 million from $6.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\nEquity in earnings of joint ventures, which own the vessels GDF Suez Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann , for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $11.5 million , an increase of $13.6 million from equity in losses of joint ventures of $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 . The reason for the increase was the Partnership's share of an unrealized gain on derivative financial instruments of the joint ventures for the three months ended June 30, 2015 of $9.9 million compared with an unrealized loss of $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 . For the three months ended June 30, 2015 , the Partnership's share of operating income in the joint ventures was $5.7 million compared with $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by investors to measure financial and operating performance. Please see Appendix A for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nFinancing and Liquidity\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Partnership had cash and cash equivalents of $29.4 million and an undrawn sponsor credit facility of $85 million . During the second quarter of 2015, the Partnership received approximately $0.6 million in a cash payment from Höegh LNG for indemnification of prior period non-budgeted expenses related to the PGN FSRU Lampung pursuant to the omnibus agreement Höegh LNG entered into with the Partnership at the time of its initial public offering. After June 30, 2015 , the Partnership received an additional cash payment from Höegh LNG for indemnification of current period non-budgeted expenses of approximately $0.6 million . The cash payment for the indemnification received in the second quarter was recorded as a contribution to equity as of June 30, 2015 . The cash payment for the indemnification received in the third quarter will be recorded as a contribution to equity for the third quarter of 2015. Current restricted cash for operating obligations of the PGN FSRU Lampung was $9.5 million and long-term restricted cash required under the credit facility related to the PGN FSRU Lampung (the \"Lampung Facility\") was $15.1 million as of June 30, 2015 . The Partnership has an interest-bearing demand note due from Höegh LNG of $140.0 million which will be used as part of the consideration for the acquisition of the Höegh Gallant .\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Partnership made a quarterly repayment of $4.7 million on the Lampung facility. The Partnership's total long-term debt was $202.8 million as of June 30, 2015 .\nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Partnership had outstanding interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $202.8 million to hedge against the interest rate risks of its long-term debt under the Lampung facility. The Partnership applies hedge accounting for derivative instruments. The Partnership receives interest based on three month US dollar LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of 2.8%. The carrying value of the liability for derivative financial instruments was $8.4 million as of June 30, 2015 . The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in other comprehensive income. The loss on derivative instruments of approximately $8 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was due to amortization of the amount excluded from hedge effectiveness related to the Lampung facility. There was no comparable gain or loss on derivative instruments for the three months ended June 30, 2014 .\nOn August 14, 2015 , the Partnership paid a cash distribution of $0.3375 per unit with respect to the second quarter of 2015, equivalent to $1.35 per unit on an annualized basis. The distribution totaled $8.9 million .\nOutlook\nAnnounced Acquisition of Höegh Gallant\nOn August 12, 2015 , the Partnership announced that it had agreed to acquire the entity that owns the FSRU Höegh Gallant for a purchase price of $370 million (including debt) from a subsidiary of Höegh LNG, subject to certain post-closing purchase price adjustments. The existing debt related to the Höegh Gallant of approximately $183 million and the associated interest rate swaps and will continue to be outstanding. The Partnership will finance the purchase price through the cancellation of a $140 million demand note from Höegh LNG and the issuance of a seller's credit of $47 million due in 18 months to a subsidiary of Höegh LNG. The seller's credit will carry an interest rate of 8% per annum. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of September 2015 and is subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe Höegh Gallant was constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (\"HHI\") and was delivered to Höegh LNG in November 2014 . In April 2015 , the Höegh Gallant began operating under a charter that expires in 2020 with Hoegh LNG Egypt LLC (\"EgyptCo\"), a subsidiary of Höegh LNG. EgyptCo has a charter with the government-owned Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (\"EGAS\") that expires in April 2020 . Additionally, Höegh LNG and the Partnership have entered into an option agreement pursuant to which the Partnership has the right to cause Höegh LNG to charter the vessel from the expiration or termination of the EgyptCo charter until July 2025 at a rate equal to 90% of the rate payable pursuant to the current charter with EgyptCo, plus any incremental taxes or operating expenses as a result of the new charter.\nThe Partnership estimates that the purchase of the Höegh Gallant will generate annual contracted revenues, net of operating expenses and taxes, of approximately $39 million to $41 million with respect to the period of the EgyptCo charter.\nThe Board of Directors of the Partnership (the \"Board\") and the Conflicts Committee thereof, as well as the Board of Directors of Höegh LNG, have approved the transaction. To assist it in its evaluation of the transaction, the Conflicts Committee retained an independent financial advisor.\nAs a result of the transaction, management of the Partnership intends to recommend to the Board that it consider an increase to $0.4125 per unit in the Partnership's quarterly cash distribution, an increase of approximately 22% from the current quarterly distribution of $0.3375 per unit, which would become effective for the distribution with respect to the quarter ending December 31, 2015. Any increased distribution would be conditional upon, among other things, the closing of the transaction, the approval by the Board and the absence of any material adverse developments that would make such an increase inadvisable.\nFSRU Independence Update\nPursuant to the omnibus agreement, the Partnership has a right to purchase from Höegh LNG all or a portion of its interests in the FSRU Independence within 24 months after the acceptance of the vessel by her charterer, subject to reaching an agreement with Höegh LNG regarding the purchase price and other terms of the transaction in accordance with the provisions of the omnibus agreement. The Partnership and Höegh LNG continue to await the consent of the charterer as to the transaction. No assurance at the current time can be given regarding the timing of such consent or consummation or timing of the Independence transaction or the terms on which such transaction will be made.\nPotential Future Opportunities\nPursuant to the omnibus agreement, Höegh LNG is obligated to offer to the Partnership any FSRU or LNG carrier operating under a charter of five or more years.\nHöegh LNG has entered into the following agreements with respect to its newbuilding FSRUs:\nOn November 1, 2014 , Höegh LNG signed a contract for a minimum term of ten years with Sociedad Portuaria El Cayao S.A. E.S.P. (\"SPEC\") to provide an FSRU (the Höegh Grace ) to service a new LNG import terminal in Colombia. The contract is expected to commence in the middle of 2016. On May 26, 2015 , Höegh LNG signed a contract for a term of twenty years with Octopus LNG SpA (\"Octopus\") to provide an FSRU to service for the Penco-Lirquen LNG import terminal to be located in Concepcion Bay, Chile . The contract is subject to Octopus completing financing and obtaining necessary environmental approvals. Höegh LNG will service the contract with an FSRU from its newbuilding program currently in progress. The contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2018. On June 1, 2015 , Höegh LNG announced the order of the eighth FSRU from HHI. The FSRU is expected to be delivered in 2018 and is not yet under charter. The shipbuilding agreement with HHI also includes a firm priced option for an additional FSRU with a predefined delivery window. There can be no assurance that the Partnership will acquire any vessels from Höegh LNG.\nPotential Restatement of Financial Statements / Indemnification\nOn August 12, 2015 , the Partnership announced that it is reviewing its accounting treatment for certain Indonesian withholding and value added tax payments for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, each quarter within the year ended December 31, 2014, the quarter ended December 31, 2013 and the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 . As a result of its review to date, the Partnership believes that it may be necessary to restate its financial statements for such periods in order to adjust its accounting treatment for certain Indonesian withholding and value added tax payments. It is possible that additional adjustments to the Partnership's financial statements may be identified as the Partnership completes its review. The Partnership is indemnified by Höegh LNG for all non-budgeted, non-creditable Indonesian value added taxes and non-budgeted Indonesian withholding taxes, and any related impact on cash flow that may arise out of such review. If an indemnification payment is received from Höegh LNG, the amount is expected to be recorded as a contribution to equity. The change, if any, to the accounting treatment for the Indonesia withholding and value added tax payments is not expected to materially affect the Partnership's cash flows, liquidity or distributable cash flow on a prospective basis. The Audit Committee of the Board is discussing the matters related to the potential restatement with Ernst & Young AS, the Partnership's independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe preliminary results announced today and the data for the comparable historical period do not reflect the impact of these potential restatement adjustments.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning future events and the Partnership's operations, performance and financial condition.

2015 AND 2014 2\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThere are two operating segments. The segment profit measure is Segment EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other financial items (gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net). Segment EBITDA is reconciled to operating income and net income in the segment presentation below. The two segments are \"Majority held FSRUs\" and \"Joint venture FSRUs.\" In addition, unallocated corporate costs that are considered to benefit the entire organization and interest income from advances to joint ventures and the demand note due from Höegh LNG are included in \"Other.\"\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, Majority held FSRUs includes the direct financing lease related to the PGN FSRU Lampung. For the three months ended June 30, 2014, Majority held FSRUs includes a newbuilding, the PGN FSRU Lampung, and construction contract revenues and expenses of the tower yoke mooring system (the \"Mooring\") under construction. The Mooring was constructed on behalf of, and was sold to, PGN using the percentage of completion method of accounting. The Mooring project was completed as of December 31, 2014.\nAs of June 30, 2015 and 2014, Joint venture FSRUs include two 50% owned FSRUs, the GDF Suez Neptune and the GDF Suez Cape Ann, that operate under long term time charters with one charterer, GDF Suez Global LNG Supply SA.\nThe accounting policies applied to the segments are the same as those applied in the financial statements, except that Joint venture FSRUs are presented under the proportional consolidation method for the segment note in the Partnership's financial statements and under equity accounting for the consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements. Under the proportional consolidation method, 50% of the Joint venture FSRUs' revenues, expenses and assets are reflected in the segment note. Management monitors the results of operations of joint ventures under the proportional consolidation method and not the equity method of accounting.

EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization and taxes. Segment EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, taxes and other financial items. Other financial items consist of gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net (including foreign exchange gains and losses and withholding tax on interest expenses). Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, taxes, other financial items and cash collections on direct financial lease investments. Cash collections on direct finance lease investments consist of the difference between the payments under the time charter and the revenues recognized as a financial lease (representing the repayment of the principal recorded as a receivable). Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of financial statements, such as the Partnership's lenders, to assess its financial and operating performance. The Partnership believes that Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assist its management and investors by increasing the comparability of its performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in the industry that provide Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA information. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, depreciation and amortization and taxes, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. The Partnership believes that including Segment EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in it and other investment alternatives and (b) monitoring its ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units. The Partnership believes Adjusted EBITDA benefits investors in comparing its results to other investment alternatives that account for time charters as operating leases rather than financial leases. Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the segments and the Partnership as a whole (combined carve-out reporting) to net income (loss), the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2015\nJoint venture\nConsolidated\nMajority\nFSRUs\nTotal\nand\nheld\n(proportional\nSegment\ncombined\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFSRUs\nconsolidation)\nOther\nreporting\nreporting\nReconciliation to net income\nNet income\n$\n4,231\n11,481\n604\n16,316\n$\n16,316\nInterest income\n-\n-\n(2,425)\n(2,425)\n(2,425)\nInterest expense, net\n3,431\n4,089\n303\n7,823\n3,734\nDepreciation and amortization\n8\n2,309\n-\n2,317\n8\nIncome tax expense\n179\n-\n-\n179\n179\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Interest (income) expense, net\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,089\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Depreciation and amortization\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,309\nOther financial items 3\n939\n(9,897)\n3\n(8,955)\n942\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Other financial items 3\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(9,897)\nSegment EBITDA\n8,788\n7,982\n(1,515)\n15,255\n15,255\nPrincipal payment on direct financing lease\n700\n-\n-\n700\n700\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n9,488\n7,982\n(1,515)\n15,955\n$\n15,955\n3 Other financial items consist of gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net including foreign exchange gains or losses and withholding tax on interest expense.\nAppendix A: Adjusted EBITDA and Segment EBITDA (cont.)\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2014\nJoint venture\nConsolidated\nMajority\nFSRUs\nTotal\nand\nheld\n(proportional\nSegment\ncombined\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFSRUs\nconsolidation)\nOther\nreporting\nreporting\nReconciliation to net loss\nNet loss\n$\n(4,717)\n(2,125)\n(462)\n(7,304)\n$\n(7,304)\nInterest income\n-\n-\n(435)\n(435)\n(435)\nInterest expense, net\n2,212\n4,294\n-\n6,506\n2,212\nDepreciation and amortization\n972\n2,288\n-\n3,260\n972\nIncome tax benefit\n(175)\n-\n-\n(175)\n(175)\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Interest (income) expense, net\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,294\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Depreciation and amortization\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2,288\nOther financial items 3\n511\n3,755\n-\n4,266\n511\nEquity in earnings of JVs : Other financial items 3\n-\n-\n-\n-\n3,755\nSegment EBITDA\n(1,197)\n8,212\n(897)\n6,118\n6,118\nPrincipal payment on direct financing lease\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(1,197)\n8,212\n(897)\n6,118\n$\n6,118\n3 Other financial items consist of gains and losses on derivative instruments and other items, net including foreign exchange gains or losses and withholding tax on interest expense.\nAppendix B: Distributable Cash Flow Distributable cash flow represents Segment EBITDA adjusted for cash collections on principal repayments on the direct financing lease, interest income, interest expense less amortization of debt issuance cost, other items (net) less unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses, current income tax expense, other adjustments and estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures. Estimated maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, including estimated expenditures for drydocking, represent capital expenditures required to maintain over the long-term the operating capacity of, or the revenue generated by, the Partnership's capital assets. Distributable cash flow is presented starting with Total Segment reporting using the proportional consolidation method for the Partnership's 50% interests in the joint ventures as shown in Appendix A. Therefore, the adjustments to Segment EBITDA include the Partnership's share of the joint venture's adjustments. Distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used by investors in publicly-traded partnerships to assist in evaluating a partnership's ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other indicator of the Partnership's performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities, and these measures may vary among companies. Therefore, distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Distributable cash flow is not the same measure as available cash or operating surplus, both of which are defined by the Partnership's partnership agreement. The table below reconciles distributable cash flow to Segment EBITDA, which is reconciled to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, in Appendix A.
