This is because the sky above the biosphere reserve is particularly dark at night, allowing you to see the stars without the effects of light pollution.\nWhy not visit the Rhön Biosphere Reserve for an astronomy-themed walk and discover celestial wonders in the company of a qualified guide?\nThe Rhön hills are also well worth exploring by day. Among the many exciting activities on offer are ranger-led tours of the moors, llama trekking, wild cat walks, climbing tours and even craft and farmers markets.\nSource: GNTB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:23:25.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
