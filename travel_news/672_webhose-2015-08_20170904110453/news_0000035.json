Definitely looking forward to this show in Toronto .\"According to Emskee about this performance, \"Not only is this a great opportunity because we're taking our brand of skills across the border to Canada (and we love to travel) to perform for a crowd that appreciates authentic hip hop/soul, but since we haven't performed in more than a few months, this is a barometer to see where we are before embarking on some college tour dates coming up.
