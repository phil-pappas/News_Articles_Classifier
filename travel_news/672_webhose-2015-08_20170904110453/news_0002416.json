The gift card programme encourages return visits to the hotel and restaurant facilities and makes it easy to run promotions and special offers with full tracking of spend and a link to the guest profile.\nSays Caroline Gregory at The Lovat: “Our aim is always for our guests to experience the ultimate relaxing break, with the hotel creating a home from home experience, and offering a personal touch and calming atmosphere through our hotel and its facilities.\n“To ensure this occurs right from the booking experience, back of house needs to operate seamlessly to deliver a great guest experience. We had originally relied on various disjointed systems, such as a database, online booking, EPOS, accounting etc, but none had the ability to communicate with each other.\nSource:-NFS Technology Group", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:20:14.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
