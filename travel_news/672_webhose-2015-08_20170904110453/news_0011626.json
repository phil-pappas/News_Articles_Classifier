Umbrella group Universities Scotland said the Higher Education Governance Bill creates such close links with the state that it endangers institutions’ charitable status and could mean they are officially classified as part of the public sector. Some of their “most important sources of finance” could be cut off as a result, they warned, giving them no choice but to scale back their activities and operations. Changing their status would mean they were no longer be eligible for tax breaks worth more than £27 million per year and would \"severely” hamper their ability to raise the £53 million per year they currently receive from philanthropists. Universities also warned the change would endanger sources of funding that support the “great majority” of their investment programmes, which are worth around £370 million per year. They said their money-raising ventures with the private sector risk being damaged and restrictions placed on their ability to borrow, or run surpluses and invest them in improved facilities. In a submission to Holyrood’s finance committee, which is investigating the bill, the universities said charitable status is “essential” to their solvency and concluded: “Donors are highly unlikely to wish to support institutions who are no longer charities.” They warned the bill could lead to a “critical change” and have “real operational impacts” on their activities, although they did not specify whether this could mean cuts in student places, research, courses or staff. Among the legislation’s controversial measures is giving the Scottish Government the power to decide how senior figures on university courts are appointed , including how long the chairmen are allowed to serve and whether they can be reappointed for a second term. It also imposes quotas for the number of student representatives and trade unionists who sit on governing bodies and creates a new legal definition of \"academic freedom\". Currently the chairmen are chosen by a selection committee, which includes student and staff representatives. SNP ministers have repeatedly highlighted the fact that Scotland has three universities in the world's top 100, but have argued they need to be made more accountable because of the amount of public money they receive. But the University of St Andrews has previously warned the legislation \"brings politicians very close\" to the running of supposedly autonomous organisations and threatens universities' ability to compete internationally. The Universities Scotland submission said that current legislation bans an organisation from being classified as a charity if its constitution permits Scottish ministers to “direct or otherwise control its activities.” Losing this status would mean universities would no longer be entitled to 80 per cent relief from non-domestic rates, estimated in 2008 as being worth £27 million per year, and would “severely prejudice institutions’ capacity to access philanthropic funding”. Charitable status is also viewed as an “essential part” of their “identity and mission”, the submission said. However, it warned an even larger risk was posed by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassifying them as “Central Government entities”. The ONS examines the extent of government control and influence over an institution before deciding whether it should be deemed part of the public sector, and Universities Scotland said the additional controls the Bill hands to ministers “heightens the risk” this will happen. Classifying universities as being part of the state would lead to greater restrictions on borrowing, a “major reduction of partnership with the private sector” and the “loss of incentive” to earn income from entrepreneurial business ventures, the submission said. This would “inevitably” lead to them reducing their “levels of activity and investment”, the document said, with any shortfalls having to be met by diverting money from existing budgets. The submission said there would be “significant implications” for Scottish Government priorities such as skills provision and admitting more youngsters from poor backgrounds. It also warned that the Scottish Government had underestimated the costs to universities of the Bill’s provisions. If ministers introduce a system where chairmen are appointed who do not have the confidence of governing bodies, the universities warned this could result in “strategic opportunities to be missed, as well as loss of revenue via reputational damage.” Advertising for a new chairman would cost Scotland’s universities between £72,000 and £144,000 more than the Bill’s financial memorandum estimated, while their total salaries would be between £220,000 and £400,000 more. Liz Smith, Scottish Tory young people spokesman, said the Bill was “an assault on the autonomy of the university sector” and it was “absolutely right to flag up what are very significant concerns about the implications of reclassification.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-24T20:28:42.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
