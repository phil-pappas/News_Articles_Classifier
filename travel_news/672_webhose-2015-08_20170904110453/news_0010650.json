in October last year, Chinese tourist Wu Xin, also traveling via the FIT program, gained access to an off-limits machine room in a Chunghwa Telecom office in Taipei and took pictures which he posted online, calling himself “the first Chinese to have ever entered a Taiwanese military base.” \nThere were also Chinese who concealed their political or military backgrounds and who have disappeared after entering the nation. \nA Control Yuan report released in March found that the current FIT application is filled out online by the applicants themselves, with the visa being issued about 48 hours after the forms and documents have been submitted. \nThis means that a review thorough enough to uncover any deliberate dishonesty on the part of applicants is unlikely to take place. \nTaiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Yeh Chin-ling cast doubt on the government’s attempt to save the nation’s economy and tourism industry by granting access to more Chinese tourists, saying the move has driven away tourists from other places such as Japan, the US and Europe. \nIn 2008, 38 percent of tourists visiting Taiwan were Japanese, but last year, the percentage dropped to 16 percent, she said. \nChinese tourists, many of whom travel on low or even zero budget packages as part of travel agencies’ marketing and promotion schemes, have a consumptive power that is only two-thirds that of Japanese, US and European tourists, Yeh said. \nThe value created pales in comparison with the costs that Taiwan has to pay in terms of national security, environmental protection and the burden on transportation, she said. \nHsieh said the cap raised this time is for more Chinese FIT tourists to travel to Taiwan, not tour groups, so the benefits they bring would be more “balanced across different sectors.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:58:26.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
