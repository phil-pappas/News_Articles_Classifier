Chicago's finances may be a total shambles. But hey this city's residents get to commute on state-of-the-art buses. The Chicago Transit Authority said today it will purchase an additional 125 new buses above and beyond the 400 it has acquired since Rahm Emanuel became mayor of this cash-strapped city in 2011. With the purchase of the 125 buses announced today, nearly 85 percent of the CTA's bus fleet will be new or like new. The \"like new\" buses include 1,000 buses that have been — or soon will be — overhauled. Each of the 40-foot new buses will feature LED lighting, multiple security cameras and improved fuel economy. The CTA expects to begin receiving the first of the 125 additional buses as early as May, 2016. The new 125-bus order is part of a contract the CTA awarded to Nova Bus in early 2013. The CTA already has purchased 300 buses as part of that contract and has added 230 of them to the bus fleet. Total value of the contract for the purchase of 425 buses plus spare parts and tools is approximately $220 million. A combination of federal funds and CTA bond proceeds are being used to acquire the buses. Noted Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel : \"Today I'm pleased to say that we continue to deliver on our promise to create a world-class transit system by investing in a modern fleet for customers.\" \nWant Chicago Travel news in your inbox?
