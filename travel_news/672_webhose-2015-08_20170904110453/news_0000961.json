He was a kite surfer in his 60s I’d say and he had no family or friends around from what I could see, but there were a group of kite surfers in the area that were quite close.\n“The people that saw it happen on the jetty said he drifted away and it was about 300m before the guy got to him.”\nMs Norman said that the incident shows that first aid experience can be required at any time in any situation.\n“It just goes to show that more people need to learn first aid and be willing to step in,” she said.\n“Because at the end of the day — it’s a Sunday, enjoying a sport he’s passionate about and the more people who are confident in helping and trying to help, the better.\n“The man had been dragging the body for a long time and no one was there to help sooner. Apparently, from what I could see there were no lifeguards or response and you can’t help thinking if there were, it might have had a better outcome.”\nScene where a man believed to be in his 60s died and was pulled from the water by a fellow kite surfers. #NewsADL pic.twitter.com/LoEFVZyryl\n— Sam Kelton (@kelts82) August 9, 2015", "external_links": ["http://t.co/LoEFVZyryl", "https://twitter.com/kelts82/status/630242367266623488", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewsADL?src=hash"], "published": "2015-08-10T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T10:10:38.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
