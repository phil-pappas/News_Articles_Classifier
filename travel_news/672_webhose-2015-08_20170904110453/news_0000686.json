His new $1.6 million salary, down from the $3 million he was set to earn, applies only to 2015; his salary for 2016, the final year on his deal, remains at $3.25 million.\nThe changed contract increases the chances Colquitt will remain the Broncos' punter.\nThe team had signed kicker/punter Karl Schmitz in March. But the 28-year-old rookie from Jacksonville University who gained a following on YouTube hasn't played in a game since 2008.\nColquitt is the second Broncos player to take less money this season. Quarterback Peyton Manning agreed to a $4 million pay cut, for a salary of $15 million. His $19 million salary for 2016 remains unchanged.\nThe extra money from Manning's contract gave the Broncos some needed room to go shopping in free agency after losing a number of key veterans on the open market.\nESPN first reported Colquitt's restructured contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:09:50.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
