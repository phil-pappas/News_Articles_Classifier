Its equity partners include airberlin, Alitalia, Virgin Australia, India’s Jet Airways and Air Seychelles. \nPilots from airberlin, Alitalia, Jet Airways, City Liner, Darwin Airline and Niki will be given the opportunity to fly Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A380 aircraft, Etihad said yesterday. \nThe carrier’s president and chief executive, James Hogan, said the initiative highlighted the success of its business model, which includes sharing resources with its equity partners. \n“Our pilot secondment program is such an exciting and unique opportunity for pilots across our group of partner airlines, many of whom have a wealth of experience and are passionate about flying,” Mr Hogan said. \nUnder the scheme, pilots are trained for about five to seven months before taking a test to obtain a licence from the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority. \nOnce the licence is acquired, pilots then fly with certified instructors for a minimum of three weeks. \nThere are 21 former airberlin pilots that have transferred to permanent roles with Etihad, flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A380. Etihad plans to operate 70 787s and 9 A380s by 2025, according to the airline. \nPilots are given more opportunities for promotion within the company as a larger variety of aircraft allow for more versatility, Etihad said. \n“I did not hesitate to join the airline on a permanent contract because of the future possibility to upgrade to captain,” said first officer Julian Kirrinnis, who joined Etihad two years ago from airberlin. \nEtihad said that it usually takes about 10 to 15 years to achieve a command position in most legacy carriers, but the average for the Abu Dhabi company is approximately three years. \n“We are able to put our pilots at the forefront of modern aviation, and look forward to welcoming many more to join our family,” said Mr Hogan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:51:27.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
