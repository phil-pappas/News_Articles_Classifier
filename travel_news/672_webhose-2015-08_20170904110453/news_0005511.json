Arden Theatre Co. , located at 40 N. 2nd St. in Old City, will delay its 2015/2016 season by one week because of the pope's visit in September. Need a place to stay for Pope Francis? How about a battleship? \"Sixty percent of the Arden’s ticket buyers live outside of Center City,\" managing director Amy L. Murphy said. \"We would hate for audience members to miss the show or face difficulties getting to and from the theater during the week of the Pope’s visit.” The World Meeting of Families and Pope Francis's visit will be from Sept. 22-27, coinciding with the theater's initial dates for Metamorphoses, the season opener. Metamorphoses will now run from Oct. 1 through Nov. 1. The show Equivocation, making its Philadelphia premiere, will also be affected and will now run from Oct. 22 through Dec. 13. \nWant Philadelphia Travel news in your inbox?
