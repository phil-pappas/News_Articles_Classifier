Embark on a Great British Drive » Of all the seasons, motorists look forward to summer most, evoking thoughts of day trips to the beach and the countryside. It's when most of us tackle our longest trips of the year, so planning is required to make it all go smoothly. A few basic checks are essential before you leave. 1 Tyres Ensure your tyres are in good condition, within the legal tread depth and correctly inflated. Vehicle manufacturers usually recommend two sets of tyre pressures: one for normal loads and one for when the car is laden. These higher-laden pressures enable the tyres to carry additional load (when you’re travelling with more passengers or extra luggage, for instance). If you’re towing a caravan or trailer don’t forget that these tyres also need close attention. You can find a wealth of information about pressure checks and tread depths at michelin.co.uk 2 Under the bonnet Check the levels of the engine oil as well as the fluid in the cooling system and windscreen washer reservoir. Lights and windscreen wipers must also be in good condition and you should ensure the car’s service record is up to date. 3 Before you head off Check traffic updates online to avoid any jams. Breakdown services frequently get call-outs from motorists who can’t access – or start – their cars, after losing the keys on the beach or inadvertently taking them for a swim in their shorts, so plan to keep them safe. 4 Entertainment en-route Finally, it’s not just about the car – it’s about people, too. Stock up on cold drinks in case you do get stuck in tailbacks and – for the sake of your own nerves – make sure there’s plenty on board to keep children happy. High-tech solutions including in-car TV screens and tablets work well but, for a change, try a good old Michelin I-Spy book; highly engaging for all the family and educational too.
