Our experience of working with ATA is extremely positive. It is a wonderful organisation and we very much look forward to helping further develop its ‘Golf4all’ concept, which is, obviously, in total harmony with our association’s philosophy.”\nMaria Manuel Delgado e Silva, ATA golf product manager, added: “We were delighted when EDGA decided we could host one of its most important events last year – the end-of-season tournament.\n“At that point, we kicked off our ‘Golf4all’ campaign and decided to really commit to bridging the divisions in golf by promoting it as a sporting activity suitable for everyone, regardless of age, gender, skill or impairment. Since then, the campaign has come a long way and we’re thrilled to be welcoming EDGA back this year.\n“The Algarve is not only Europe’s number-one golf destination, but also one of the most welcoming and inclusive destinations – that is something we are extremely proud of and something we wanted to portray through our ‘Golf4all’ campaign.\n“We hope to continue growing the game of golf and broadening the destination experience for the myriad golfers who head here for sunshine golf each year.”\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:45:18.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
