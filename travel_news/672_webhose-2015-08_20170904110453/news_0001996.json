Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nTHE latest round of flight disruption out of Bali due to volcanic ash could continue till the weekend. \nJetstar has joined Virgin Australia in cancelling flights in and out of Bali Ngurah Rai Airport for the rest of the day, as north-westerly winds blow ash over Denpasar. \nThe airlines are constantly re-assessing flight conditions but the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre is forecasting the winds to persist for several days. \n“We’re expecting winds in that general direction for the next few days,” said senior meteorologist with the VAAC, Bri Macpherson. \n“There’s a low in the mid-levels of the atmosphere to the south of Java and that’s directing these north-westerly winds.” [Travel alert] Some Bali flights delayed or cancelled http://t.co/yyWLWRx3Uj — Jetstar Airways (@JetstarAirways) August 4, 2015 Volcanic ash erupts from Mount Raung in Indonesia causing flights to and from Bali to be stopped. Picture: Rob Maccoll Source: Supplied \nMs Macpherson said their counterparts in Indonesia had been unable to offer any advice about the extent of the Mount Raung eruptions. \nThe volcano began erupting in late June, and has continued to blow out ash almost continuously since then. \nIn that period, hundreds of flights have been cancelled, delayed or rescheduled disrupting the travel plans of thousands of Australians. \nA Jetstar spokeswoman said they were advising customers not to travel to the airport if they were flying to or from Bali, and to monitor their flight status on Jetstar.com. \n“Our team will continue to monitor the ash cloud with the VAAC around the clock and we will resume flying as soon as it is safe to do so,” said the spokeswoman. \nAs the volcanic eruptions have been going on for so long, travel insurers are no longer expected to cover people for travel disruption caused by “an unforeseen event”. \nCEO of Southern Cross Travel Insurance, Craig Morrison said travellers should first talk to their airline, and than their insurer. \n“If your carrier is offering to send you to another destination, it’s important to talk to your insurer as you may need to make a change to your existing policy or purchase a new policy due to the change in destination,” said Mr Morrison. \nHe advised travellers stuck in Bali, to hang onto receipts for additional costs. \nMount Raung began spewing the corrosive, silica-based ash in late June leading to a round of flight cancellations in July — a peak holiday season — and the airport at Denpasar had to be closed on several occasions. \nIt is considered dangerous for aircraft to fly through volcanic ash because of the risk of engine failure and the damage to the plane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:27:15.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
