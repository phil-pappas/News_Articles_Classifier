After 15 years outside his homeland of Egypt, Ali returns back to the Mediterranean shores with a wide experience that he gained all over the world.\n“Ali is a true Four Seasons success story. I am very proud of his remarkable achievements since he joined the company with the opening of Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at The First Residence in February 2000. His passion and dedication makes him a role model where ever he goes and an honorable ambassador for Egyptians,” declares Ahmed Khalaf, General Manager.\nAli spent years travelling the world, starting from Cairo to the opening of Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh as Assistant Housekeeping Manager, and on to another opening of the former Four Seasons Resort Great Exuma in the Bahamas as Assistant Director of Housekeeping. Having done three openings already, Ali’s valuable expertise prepared him to assist in the opening of Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza. He later crossed the Atlantic to continue his Rooms Division career in two different positions at Four Seasons Hotel Toronto in late 2004.\nHis globe-trotting quest continued in 2007 when he headed for the Indian Ocean as Front Office Manager at Four Seasons Resort Maldives at Landaa Giraavaru, and then in mid 2008, he got promoted to Assistant Director of Rooms at Four Seasons Hotel Damascus.\nThe island life managed to lure Ali back to return to the Maldives again as Director of Rooms, but this time at Four Seasons Resort Kuda Huraa, where he earned his well deserved promotion as a Camp Manager at Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle in Thailand.\nDuring his tenure at the Camp, Ali together with his team managed to bring the Camp one achievement after another, earning many prestigious accolades and seeing remarkable business results.\n“Ali has so many passions besides excelling in his career. He enjoys seeking authentic local restaurants and mastering his squash skills. Please join me to welcome Ali back home and wish him and his family all the best as they are settling in Alexandria, the pearl of the Mediterranean,” says Khalaf.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:08:00.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
