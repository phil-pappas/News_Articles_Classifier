Comment The Daily Telegram - Adrian, MI By Daily Telegram staff Posted Aug. 19, 2015 at 11:13 AM Updated at 12:07 PM Posted Aug. 19, 2015 at 11:13 AM Updated at 12:07 PM VANBURENTWP. The Yankee Air Museum will begin offering rides in a recently acquired open-cockpit WACO YMF-5C biplane aircraft. The rides will be offered starting at 4 p.m. each Wednesday, beginning Aug. 19, at Hanger 1 at the Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti. This week’s announcement comes in advance of the annual Yankee Air Museum (YAM) Thunder of Michigan air show, which will be Aug. 29-30. Rides in the biplane will be offered then on a first-come, first-served basis. Extra flights are planned Sept. 9 and Sept. 30. Flights must be reserved in advance by contacting the YAM offices at 734-483-4030 or email biplanerides@yankeeairmuseum.org, or at www.yankeeairmuseum.org. YAMofficials reported that a typical flight experience lasts about 35 minutes, consisting of about 20 minutes in the air and about 15 minutes of pre-flight briefing and instructions. WACO, an abbreviation of the Waco Aircraft Co., was one of the first airplane manufacturers to develop the biplanes that became popular in barnstorming throughout the U.S. in the 1920s and ’30s. YAM officials noted that famed aviator Charles Lindbergh was a barnstormer who participated in many such events and air shows. Museum officials said that the gift of a ride can be a special way to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, graduation, job milestone or as a fundraiser or a way to say thanks to a veteran or any special person. A ride on the WACO for one person is $195 for members and $225 for non-members. A ride for two is $295 if one rider is a YAM member, and $325 for two non-members. There is a weight limit of 350 pounds. YAM memberships costs $60 and include a ticket to the YAM Thunder Over Michigan air show (a $40 value) and the $30 member discount for the flight. Passengers must purchase a flight in advance to be registered for one of the above dates except for the “first come-first fly” walk up flights available at Thunder Over Michigan.
