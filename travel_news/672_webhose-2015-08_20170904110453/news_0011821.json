However, the change is not expected to affect rider's ability to hail rides at Kansas City International Airport . On Tuesday, city spokesman Chris Hernandez said the Aviation Department made a small amendment to the contract it signed with the San Francisco-based company in July . In an email, Hernandez said the contract amendment will bar Uber drivers from accessing the staging area used by other transportation providers. \"Access to that staging area, also known as the 'limo lot,' is limited to those drivers who have an airport-issued transportation ID badge that requires an enhanced background check,\" Hernandez said. In April, when the city and the giant of the so-called sharing economy reached a compromise allowing Uber to continue operating in Kansas City , the city and the company agreed to allow transportation companies or drivers to provide background checks to the city. Uber will continue to pay a $3 per pickup fee that all transportation providers pay at KCI. That fee goes toward upkeep of the roads and other infrastructure. Hernandez said other transportation network companies can make an agreement with the aviation department, too. The only other one active in Kansas City, San Francisco-based Lyft Inc., has said it has no plans to resume service in the city . \nGet Kansas City  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:30:25.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
