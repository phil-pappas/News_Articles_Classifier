But where would they come from? That's the key question posed by a Star Tribune report on the Metropolitan Airports Commission's latest long-term plan, which predicts a 68 increase in passengers using MSP airport over the next 20 years. The past decade, in which passenger traffic declined by 13 percent, was an \"anomaly,\" said MAC spokesman Patrick Hogan . Not everybody agrees with the MAC's math. Mike Boyd , a Colorado airline industry consultant, told the paper, \"There’s no way they’re going to grow 68 percent.\" Even a larger Minneapolis won't have the scale needed to overtake other big Delta hubs to draw additional planes, and smaller carriers don't have big enough fleets to make a difference. If the MAC is right — and there are 54 million passengers using MSP in 2035 — the airport likely wouldn't be able to handle them easily, even with recent expansion projects like the one at Terminal 2. Hogan said the comprehensive plan doesn't authorize any construction. \nGet Minneapolis / St. Paul Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:27:21.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
