Where are you from?”\nSoon, people will be seeing a lot more of those killer cheekbones.\nWednesday, Pejic will grace every Sephora window in North America with a groundbreaking campaign for cosmetics brand Make Up For Ever.\n“I can’t wait to go to Sephora and take a selfie with my face,” Pejic says. “Makeup contracts are the Oscars of the modelling world. You start out and think, ‘Maybe one day.’ ”\nThe ads — which will appear in all 888 Sephoras from the most conservative pockets of the continent to the most liberal — refer to the transgender model as ‘Supermodel and Transwoman.’\nPejic’s Make Up For Ever campaign.

The then-male model lit the fashion world on fire in 2011, walking top runways like Marc Jacobs and Jean Paul Gaultier in both mens and womenswear shows.\nPejic’s gender fluidity made headlines across the world and mesmerised designers who were desperate to cast the buzzy new talent. But in 2014, the androgynous catwalker announced she had undergone gender-reassignment surgery and was now Andreja. Though some people she worked with in the industry discouraged the surgery, saying it would diminish Pejic’s uniqueness — and therefore the work she got — she forged ahead.\n“I was modelling to make money for my transition and support my family, so I kind of had this undefined career,” she says. “I would have done [gender-reassignment surgery] either way. I was prepared for the worst.”\nModels Andreja Pejic and Lily Donaldson joined Taylor Swift onstage during The 1989 Tour on July 19, 2015 in Chicago. Photo: Daniel Boczarski/LP5.

She recently signed with the Society Management, which also represents Kendall Jenner, and made her official debut as a female model in the Giles Deacon show in February.\n“Before, I always felt like an alien creature. But this was good. I felt like one of the girls,” she says of the show.\nThen, in May, Pejic became the first transgender model profiled in Vogue . Next month, in addition to the Make Up For Ever deal, she will front a campaign for a label she refuses to name. “It’s a very mainstream American brand,” she teases.\nPejic says the career change has treated her well.\n“I felt like an immigrant when I was doing female jobs [before the transition],” she says. “I went to Japan and was walking as a girl, and a lot of the models were like, ‘Oh, he’s taking all of the jobs.’ Whereas now, I feel like people get it more.”\nHer career isn’t the only thing that’s shifted — the NYC East Village resident is now in a serious romantic relationship.\nAndreja Pejic in NYC.

But all of that changed last Halloween at a party in Brooklyn, where she met her new beau.\n“I wasn’t expecting a relationship, and it just evolved into one,” she reveals. “He’s very supportive. He just sees me as a girl, which is what I want.”\nShe declines to name him, only saying that he doesn’t work in the fashion industry.\nIn addition to her robust social life and booming modelling career, Pejic is filming a documentary of her transition, which she hopes will be ready for the Sundance Film Festival in January. But her busy schedule doesn’t prevent her from her hobbies, which include hot yoga and reading the Economist.\n“I like macroeconomics, and I like to know what’s going on in the world,” she says. “If I wasn’t modelling, I’d be studying economics or international politics.”\nOne perk that is not lost on a student of markets: Modelling is the rare industry where women far out-earn men.\n“There are so many male models who are working in high fashion and they are broke,” she says, pausing to find her words. “It’s good to be a woman.”\nThis article originally appeared on The New York Post .\nOriginally published as Aussie model looks amazing in new beauty campaign", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/08/11/andreja-pejic-takes-the-beauty-industry-by-storm-with-new-transwoman-campaign/", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/andreja-pejic-takes-the-beauty-industry-by-storm-with-new-transwoman-campaign/story-fnks7u94-1227479978632", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/08/12/1227479/978364-d87c3f18-4077-11e5-aee4-367c73406707.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/12/1227479/978310-d30c36e6-4077-11e5-aee4-367c73406707.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/12/1227479/978230-5791534c-4078-11e5-aee4-367c73406707.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-12T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:45:44.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
