To celebrate its arrival and 50th anniversary, the Montréal Cruise Committee is encouraging Montrealers and tourists to come to the Old Port's magnificent boardwalk at 8:15 a.m., when the ship is scheduled to arrive with 750 guests and 220 crew members aboard. To welcome the Marco Polo, there will be a water show, with jets sprayed from tugboats owned by Ocean Group. In 1965, Germany's Wismar shipyard delivered to Russia a cruise ship named after the celebrated Russian poet Alexandr Pushkin. This ship completed transatlantic voyages travelling from Leningrad to Montréal, with stops in Helsinki , Copenhagen , London and Québec City. It would be the beginning of a long love affair between the ship and Montréal, as the Alexandr Pushkin visited Montréal 114 times in all. Its final trip to Montréal was on August 18, 1980. \"Like probably thousands of Quebecers, I have family members who had the chance to travel on the Alexandr Pushkin. Now, I'm delighted to welcome back this ship that played an important role in Montréal's cruise industry for 15 years,\" said Sylvie Vachon , President and CEO of the Port of Montréal. Since cruise season began, the Port of Montréal has already welcomed some 25,000 cruise ship passengers and crew members, and by the time the season closes on October 29 , this number is expected to be as high 90,000. This encouraging projection is more than 27% higher than last year, when 56,466 passengers and 14,578 crew members stopped in Montréal. \"We're anticipating a record high this year, as 19 internationally renowned ships have scheduled stops in Montréal. The fact that all these cruise lines choose to include our city on their itineraries proves that Montréal is a destination of choice for tourists from around the world. This year, a total of 77 stopovers are expected, up from 52 last year. I'm pleased to report that Montréal has the wind in its sails and we're on our way to achieving our ambitious targets for the year,\" said Yves Lalumière, President and CEO of Tourisme Montréal. Supported by Tourisme Québec, the Montréal Cruise Committee works closely with the Montréal Port Authority and Tourisme Montréal, as well as five other local organizations: Aéroports de Montréal, the Old Port of Montréal Corporation, the Old Montréal Business Development Corporation, and the Hotel Association of Greater Montréal. The committee's objective is to attract new cruise lines to Montréal while encouraging those that already stop here to come more frequently and stay longer once they're here.

The Marco Polo: A brief history* The Alexandr Pushkin completed its inaugural crossing in April 1966, travelling between Leningrad and Montréal. It first sailed under the banner of the Baltic Shipping Company, but was sold to the Far Eastern Shipping Company in 1985. When the Soviet Union crumbled, the company was forced to part with the Alexandr Pushkin for financial reasons and the ship was sold to Orient Lines in 1991. Renamed Marco Polo in 1991 , the ship saw its machinery revamped in Greece before resuming its operations in 1993. In 1998, the company was acquired by Norwegian Cruise Line, though the original brand name was maintained. In 2008, the company parted ways with Orient Lines and the ship. Since then, Marco Polo has been owned by the Global Maritime Group and is part of the fleet at Cruise & Maritime Voyages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:54:45.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
