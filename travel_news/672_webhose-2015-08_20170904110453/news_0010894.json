The event, banned for a time during the 1950s at the height of General Francisco Franco's dictatorship, has drawn a huge international following in recent years.\n(Writing By Sonya Dowsett; Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T03:02:03.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
