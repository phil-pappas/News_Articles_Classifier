We thank each and every person that has taken the time to share their amazing experience with us.”\nThe high rating comes on the heels of Atlantis’ investment of around US$27 million, whereby a second 40-metre Tower of Poseidon was added, to give the waterpark a record breaking offering to guests, both regionally and globally.\nAquaventure was ranked fifth in a list that featured Siam Park in Spain, Beach Park in Brazil, Waterbom Bali in Indonesia and Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Florida.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:16:58.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
