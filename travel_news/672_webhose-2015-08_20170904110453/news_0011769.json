Photo courtesy of Masa Israel Journey\nMany college students have romantic notions of studying abroad in places like Italy or France, but Aaron White found himself at Tel Aviv University thanks to Masa Israel Journey, a program that connects young Jewish adults with study-abroad, internship and volunteer opportunities in Israel.\n“I got to see how another culture lives and witness firsthand the complicated and sometimes quixotic attempts at politics that define Israel and its neighbors,” said White, who grew up near Palm Springs and now works for a think tank in Oakland.\nThese days, though, students are flocking to the Holy Land out of more than an interest in the central role it has played in Jewish culture, history and current events. Yonatan Barkan, director of academic affairs for Masa Israel Journey, sees the nation’s rise as a global hotbed for technological, medical and scientific innovation as being the next draw for young adults ages 18-30. “Israel today is a crossroads of professional, academic and personal opportunities,” he said. “Israel [has much to offer] undergraduate students, grad students and young professionals who want to leverage its business culture and booming tech scene in order to get experience they can’t get anywhere else.”\nWithin the past year, Masa Israel ( masaisrael.org ) launched training programs in project management and digital marketing, as well as coding boot camps for students looking to make inroads into the tech world. Barkan estimated Masa Israel coordinates with more than 3,000 companies with a presence in Israel — including Google, HP and Deloitte — to ensure interns’ experiences will transfer to the realities of the job market back home.\nBarkan believes Jews who have come of age in the Los Angeles area will be particularly drawn to the offerings.\n“I think that when someone is in the market for an international experience, he goes for one of two things — an experience as different as possible from their home environment or something very similar,” Barkan said. “I think that for Southern Californians and L.A. folks, Israel is both very different than what they’re used to, and yet [more] similar than expected. Both Israel and Southern California, and L.A. in particular, share similar cultural aspects, such as a laid-back atmosphere and an innovation culture.”\nMasa Israel, a joint project of the government of Israel and the Jewish Agency for Israel, is also financially supported by organizations such as The Jewish Federations of North America. Since its inception in 2004, Masa Israel has sent more than 10,000 participants per year to Israel for its more than 200 study, internship and volunteer programs, according to its website.\nEighty percent of its budget goes toward universal grants and needs-based scholarships to help alleviate tuition. Programs start at $1,000.\nMasa Israel staff and representatives work in partnership with program operators, community organizations, participants and alumni to help young adults connect with the educational program that’s best for their professional and personal objectives, the website states.\nLauren Swersky, who graduated from UC Davis last year, always knew she would spend a part of her undergraduate life studying in Israel. However, as a participant of Masa Israel, she found her education during a spring semester at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem extended far beyond the campus.\n“I seized the opportunity to enroll in unusual courses that fulfilled my general education and psychology-major requirements,” she said. “However, ‘Hasidism: From Mystic Fraternity to Reactionary’ was my absolute favorite course that semester, mainly because of the professor. All of the professors invited students over for the holidays and for fun. As UC Davis was a big university, I didn’t really have personal encounters with professors. The professors at Hebrew U, meanwhile, really made an effort to get to know us. Off campus, most people were open to talking about ‘taboo’ things like politics and religion. And many of the individuals with whom I spoke also wanted to hear what I had to say as an American.”\nEncino native Arya Marvazy, who earned his degree in psychology from UC San Diego, took part in a Masa Israel graduate program, a collaboration with New York University, and studied organizational behavior.\n“One of the highlights of my participation was working with the [Park Plaza Orchid Hotel Tel Aviv], where I helped them analyze their staff structure, improve their training program and address deficits in their original business structure,” he said. “I worked with employees and managers to improve company culture and policy to bring about better employee satisfaction and fulfillment, which is hand-in-hand with a more profitable and effective business. … It was the most challenging and transformative academic year of my life.”\nHila Arounianpour, whose resumé includes working as a director of e-commerce for Sprint, running a virtual business conference company and creating a mobile app for parking called sPARK, earned her MBA from a Masa Israel program. She encouraged younger students to explore their options for time abroad.\n“It’s the perfect way for you to get out of your own element and have a life experience that will propel you forward in personal and professional ways,” the Santa Monica resident said.\n“Masa Israel turned out to be one of the best decisions I have made in my life, especially as a big part of my program was to develop things that did not previously exist. We developed new websites, product prototypes and websites for those products. I wish I had found it sooner.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:13:19.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
