Burgu Arjaan by Rotana and Tango Arjaan by Rotana represent the group’s first foray into the European market. \nSituated in the Maltepe district on the Asian side of Istanbul, Burgu Arjaan by Rotana and Tango Arjaan by Rotana provide a tranquil haven from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Often referred to as the lesser discovered side of Istanbul, the cultural hub boasts an array of traditional food markets, elaborate palaces and charming waterside eateries. With a prime location near the coast of the Marmara Sea, the properties offer convenient proximity to the Prince Islands and the historical landmarks on the banks of the Bosphorus. Boasting striking design elements, Burgu Arjaan by Rotana and Tango Arjaan by Rotana feature 319 fully furnished hotel apartments divided across two towers. Offering sleek furnishings and panoramic views, each apartment provides all the modern conveniences of a five star hotel property which make them the perfect option for families and long term guests. Four food and beverage venues, each with its own ambience, service and cuisine will welcome guests with the incomparable Rotana hospitality and style. These include an all-day dining restaurant, a poolside restaurant, and a bar and café. Both properties share a range of leisure facilities including a state of the art Leisure & Wellness Club with indoor and outdoor swimming pools, landscaped areas as well as three meeting and conference rooms. “A breakthrough into Turkey is a significant achievement for Rotana as it’s a crucial territory to penetrate for us to solidify our standing as a leading hotel management company,” said Omer Kaddouri, President and CEO of Rotana. “We are very excited to be opening our first Turkish properties on the Asian side of Istanbul; Burgu Arjaan by Rotana and Tango Arjaan by Rotana are ideally placed in one of the city’s trendy water-front locations and have an offering that sets them apart from other hotels in the area. Our emphasis is on comfort and refinement and this is reflected across our premises, facilities and services; from the architectural design and interiors right down to the warm and friendly service that greets our guests.” A stay for two sharing a Classic Room, with daily breakfast, starts from €49 per room per night.
