Hogarths Hotel & Restaurant in Four Ashes Road in Dorridge is hosting a family fun day on Monday, August 31, and one of the hotel’s team members will serenade the crowds with her soulful singing. \nJessica Hannigan, aged 21, is a recent First Class Musical Theatre graduate from Chelmsley Wood in Solihull, and after working at Hogarths for three years as a waitress and in housekeeping has just secured her first solo gig. Set to sing from midday until 4pm, Jessica will be performing in the hotel’s Brasserie whilst guests enjoy lunch, singing chart and classic songs in a range of musical styles such as jazz, pop and rock. Jessica is delighted to have been given the opportunity to enhance her musical career and to perform at Hogarths Hotel & Restaurant. “I have always loved performing and first discovered a passion for musicals when I was just seven-years-old so for Hogarths to help me make my ambitions come true really means a lot,” she said. “Performing at one of the most popular hotels is in the area is a fantastic gateway to pursuing the musical career I aspire for, particularly as one of my goals is to regularly perform at events. “Etta James is one of my biggest influences so with all the styles of music I will be singing, most song choices will be powerful with a lot of soul. “It’s my first booking for an event and I’m really excited. I just can’t wait to get out there and entertain the guests now.” Steven Quick, general manager at Hogarths Hotel & Restaurant, said: “Helping our team to develop both personally and professionally is a top priority at Hogarths and we are really looking forward to seeing Jessica perform on August Bank Holiday Monday. “She has worked at the hotel for quite some time now and is an asset to the team so it felt natural to help support her in whatever way we could,” he said. “Jessica has a great talent and we are sure guests who are dining in the Brasserie will thoroughly enjoy her performance.” Other entertainment to help guests get into the swing on August 31 include a Frank Sinatra tribute act.
