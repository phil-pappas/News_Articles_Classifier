These reports offer advice from market leading practitioners. The inaugural report is an article written by Justin Hersh, past President of the Exhibit Design Producers Association and CEO/Founder of Group Delphi, a leading designer and producer of exhibits, serving clients such as Pixar, Medtronic, and Jelly Belly. This report, Best Practices for Exhibit Booth Design – for Companies of All Sizes, provides advice on best practices to help exhibitors build and maintain effective exhibit programs.\nCEIR President and CEO Brian Casey, CEM noted, “CEIR provides high quality research documenting trends in performance of the exhibition industry overall as well as at the micro level, including why brand marketers use the channel for marketing and sales efforts. This new series provides concrete advice and examples on how to take CEIR research and apply trends into business action for their organizations. Justin’s report offers practical, no-nonsense advice that helps exhibitors either build or refine an exhibit program that will meet their goals for exhibiting.”\nThis nine page report breaks down and answers five key questions that assist an exhibitor when looking to build or refine their exhibition programs. These questions include:\n1. Why are we going?\n2. Why is this exhibition important to us?\n3. Is this the best use of our time and budget?\n4. What will a successful exhibition look like to us?\n5. What experience do we want attendees to have?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:47:56.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
