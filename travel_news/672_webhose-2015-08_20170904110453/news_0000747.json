Oh, and watch out for those balloons. Source: Supplied\n“Photography is not permitted beyond the rotunda floor and the museum does not allow the use of selfie sticks,” a spokesperson from The Guggenheim told Gothamist .\nThe Frick Musem, which houses the likes of Bellini and Rembrandt, has made a point to take note of the ban on its website .\n“You can, just by looking at this, imagine the havoc a selfie stick might wreak in this kind of space,” Jennifer Northrup of the Cooper-Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, told CBS.com .\nNo flash, no comercial photo, no selfie-stick BUT SELFIES ARE FINE \"Shootbklyn: My kind of place…. http://t.co/hqH28yo0Gi \" #MuseumSelfie Day\n— Lola Liquete (@lolaliquete) January 21, 2015 Central Park Zoo is so passionate about the issue it has erected a sign alerting tourists of the ban, claiming “they are dangerous to our animals”.\nNumerous attempts to contact the Zoo went unanswered.\nIt follows similar bans in Australia including Sydney’s Qantas Credit Union Arena, Melbourne’s Etihad Stadium, the Domain Stadium in WA, Perth Arena, and Suncorp stadium in Brisbane.\nSo beware, travellers, that beloved selfie stick could land you in a whole lot of trouble, and not just on your Instagram feed.\nIncrease ", "external_links": ["http://www.frick.org/visit/museum/may-i-take-photographs", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb&h=Don%26%238217%3Bt+even+think+about+bringing+this+to+NYC", "http://t.co/hqH28yo0Gi", "https://twitter.com/lolaliquete/status/557844941003849729", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb&title=Don%26%238217%3Bt+even+think+about+bringing+this+to+NYC", "http://skift.com/2014/12/31/the-selfie-stick-was-one-of-the-holidays-hottest-gifts/", "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/02/05/several-nyc-museums-ban-use-of-selfie-sticks-by-patrons/", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb&title=Don%26%238217%3Bt+even+think+about+bringing+this+to+NYC", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Don%26%238217%3Bt+even+think+about+bringing+this+to+NYC&c=IT+WAS+the+hottest+trend+of+2014%2C+but+Central+Park+Zoo+and+the+city+of+New+York%26%238217%3Bs+museums+are+so+fed+up+with+this+tourist+trend%2C+they%26%238217%3Bve+taken+action.&u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/selfie-sticks-banned-in-numerous-locations-around-new-york-city/story-fnda1lbo-1227460538477?sv=b1c14e70622f353495cd3f6b874ae0eb", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MuseumSelfie?src=hash", "http://gothamist.com/2015/02/05/selfie_sticks_imitate_art.php"], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T07:13:24.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
