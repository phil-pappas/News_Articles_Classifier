It is also the only street race in Asia on the Formula One circuit. \nSeveral events will be held concurrently with the Singapore Grand Prix.

Pasta, chocolate, bread, and macarons were used in previous years. \nInterestingly, the capsules were recycled from the hotel's 511 guest rooms and 11 meeting rooms, all of which are equipped with Nespresso machines. \nThe race car will be on display until 20 September 2015. \nSplash and Dash Party Swimming pool at the W Singapore Sentosa Cove.
