What you can do to protect the lions, elephants and rhinos in Africa Animals in Africa \nA lion relaxes at the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. \nA lion relaxes at the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. (De Agostini / Getty Images) Africa \nThe plight of Africa's animals has been the focus of media attention since Zimbabwe's beloved Cecil the lion was killed last month by an American hunter. But lions are often killed in Africa, as are many other wild animals. \nThe week after Cecil was lured out of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe and shot, five elephants were gunned down in Tsavo West National Park in Kenya and their faces cut off for the tusks. They didn't make headlines, maybe because they didn't have human names. \nLions, elephants and rhinos are severely threatened by poaching, local conflict and foreign trophy hunters. This means that three of the \"Big Five\" animals most tourists want to see in Africa are now on the road to extinction. Dodoma, Nairobi, Tarangire National Park, Amboseli National Park \nThe illegal wildlife trade (live animals, skins and parts) is, according to Public Radio International, a $20-billion annual industry. Is this a reason to get to Africa quickly? Sadly, yes. It's also a reason to make sure your tourism dollars support deserving causes if you do. \nI felt a sense of urgency, so I looked for a safari company that had contacts with East African camps involved in conservation. I booked through Delaware-based Kensington Tours, a bespoke company that listened to my requests and delivered what I requested: safari lodges that were involved with animal conservation and locations where I didn't have to sit all day in a Jeep. \nOl Donyo Lodge, a high-end safari camp at the base of the Chyulu Hills in southeastern Kenya, was founded by Richard Bonham and is now part-owned by Great Plains, an organization that uses tourism to sustain wildlife programs. \nOl Donyo is luxurious, ecologically friendly and has some of the most knowledgeable Maasai guides I have encountered. \nMost important, some of my safari dollars went to protecting the animals I'd come to see, and once there, I had an opportunity to donate to specific programs. I chose to pay school fees ($400) for a high-achieving Maasai child to become a \"Wildlife Scholar,\" meaning he or she would become an anti-poaching community activist. \nMy room had its own plunge pool, an open-air living area with slipcovered sofas, and a rooftop bed ideal for stargazing. Below my hilltop room was a watering hole, filled with water recycled from camp use, which attracted elephants and other species up close. \nGuests do not have to dine communally, as in many safari camps, and because it's on Maasai-owned land rather than in a national park, Ol Donyo offers horseback and walking safaris as well as mountain biking, making it a more active destination than your average safari location. \nOne of the guides told me that the place itself has strong energy, and I believe it. That, combined with excellent food and service, exhilarating adventures and the privacy of the lodge, made it one of the best stays I've had in many trips to Africa. \nKensington had arranged for a car and driver to take me across the border into Tanzania, a country that has lost more than 60% of its elephants to poaching. \nAt family-oriented Oliver's Camp in Tarangire National Park in Tanzania, the focus is not on direct elephant conservation, but on providing the locals with education and alternative sources of income. All of its guide staff were local Tanzanians, as were the camp employees. It also trains young people to enter the tourism industry. \nThe camp was simpler than Ol Donyo and can accommodate as many as 24 guests in spacious tents with attached bathrooms. Dining was communal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:51:12.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
