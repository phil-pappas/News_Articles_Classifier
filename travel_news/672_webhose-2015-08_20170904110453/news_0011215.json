Most of the famed beach fronting Waikiki was closed after heavy rains triggered a half-million gallon sewage spill near Hawaii's world-famous tourist district, officials said. Jae C. Hong, Associated Press Summary \nHawaii officials on Wednesday reopened world-renowned Waikiki beach after water quality tests showed bacteria levels there declined since a large sewage spill nearby earlier this week. \nHONOLULU — Hawaii officials on Wednesday reopened world-renowned Waikiki beach after water quality tests showed bacteria levels there declined since a large sewage spill nearby earlier this week. \nKeith Kawaoka, the deputy director of the state Department of Health, said his agency had authorized Honolulu to take down warning signs from Waikiki and Ala Moana beaches. \n\"The indication is that the levels have come down dramatically from yesterday to indicate that we can open at least those beach areas,\" Kawaoka told reporters. \nHeavy rain associated with Tropical Storm Kilo caused manhole covers in Honolulu to overflow with sewage and the Honolulu Zoo to flood on Monday. \nThis prompted officials to close a 4-mile stretch of waterfront, including the ocean fronting some of Hawaii's biggest hotels and the center of the state's tourism-driven economy. \nMany tourists had to give up plans to swim in the ocean in the tourist district. \nHonolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said being able to reopen the area was a priority. \n\"We recognize — both at the state and county level — in terms of our economy there's nothing more important than Waikiki,\" he said. \"We wanted to make sure that this event was over and it's over in basically two days and a little bit more.\" \nKawaoka said warning signs will remain at the Ala Wai and Kewalo boat harbors because water quality tests there indicated they were still affected by the spill. He said people should avoid coming into contact with the water in those areas. \nLori Kahikina, Honolulu's director of environmental services, said less sewage spilled than the half-million gallons the city initially reported. \nShe said Wednesday 129,000 gallons of wastewater flowed into the ocean. Another 264,000 spilled on land but never reached the ocean. \nThe city is expecting even more rain. \nThe National Weather Service on Wednesday issued a flash flood for all of Oahu Island. A new tropical storm, Ignacio, meanwhile, formed east of the Hawaiian Islands on Tuesday and is forecast to become a hurricane.
