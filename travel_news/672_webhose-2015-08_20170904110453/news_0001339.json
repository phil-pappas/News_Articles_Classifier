Below are 10 green vacation ideas that can make a difference without requiring a huge sacrifice. (So don't worry; I'm not going to tell you to go camping instead of checking into a real hotel!)

And once you arrive at your green vacation destination, take advantage of buses, monorails, ferries, and subways rather than traveling by yourselves in a gas guzzler. Passengers on the highly regarded Swiss Train System can rent bicycles at stations and bring them aboard. (c) Tumi. \nDon't bring more luggage than you need on a green vacation. It adds weight to whatever means of transportation you use, requiring more energy, and it also adds weight to the burden you carry. More » (c) Global Volunteers. 3. Take a Volunteer Vacation \nKeep your vacation green by doing good while you're away from home. Volunteer vacations enable couples to spend time on worthwhile projects such as helping to construct a holding tank for a community's water supply, building classroom furniture and playground equipment, and installing footbridges that cross local rivers.

And don't think you'll have to forgo luxury on a green vacation. At The Tides Riviera Maya , for instance, natural materials are used throughout and no motorized vehicles are allowed on the property. Be on the lookout for hotels that advertise that they are LEED-certified , which indicates they meet or exceed standards regarding how they are designed, constructed, maintained and operated.

Acknowledge that Some Destinations Should be Off-Limits Although tourism dollars are critical to many places, there are destinations whose ecosystems are so fragile that the arrival of you and hundreds or thousands of other tourists can create severe, irreversible environmental impacts. Among them: The Galapagos Islands and the Amazonian rainforest. 6. Shoot Digital Shots \nIf you want better photos that a smart phone can deliver, carry a digital camera to take great vacation pictures rather than a disposable one or an old-fashioned SLR that uses film. And use rechargable batteries rather than disposables. If you must rent a car on your green vacation, choose a hybrid or a compact model that goes farther on less gas. And drive below the speed limit. More » 8. Conserve In-Room Energy \nJust as when you’re at home, shut off the lights, TV, and air conditioner when you leave your room. Another thing you can do, if your accommodations do not have a recycling can, is to request that they place one not only in your room but in every guest room and suite in the hotel. 9. Don't Generate Unnecessary Laundry Must you have your towels and sheets changed every day? The energy and the water required to wash them are wasteful. It's become accepted practice for travelers to leave soiled towels in the bathtub; chambermaids understand that ones outside them can be used for extra days. 10. Consume Locally Maine lobster you order in San Francisco or New Zealand lamb you're served in New York are the results of extensive long-haul shipping and handling. Instead choose locally grown meats, vegetables, fruits, and wines on your green vacation; you'll develop a fuller appreciation of your area while you savor it.
