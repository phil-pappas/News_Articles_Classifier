Other clips were taken used an underwater camera. \nIn his guide to whale watching holidays , he writes: \"You never forget your first whale. The impact it makes upon you is huge and life is never quite the same again. My first whale was a 40ft grey, off the coast of California in 1979, and I’ve been a whale addict ever since. Now I have to go whale watching at regular intervals just to survive normal daily life.\" \nCawardine describes greys as the \"friendliest\" whale species and Baja California as \"arguably the best whale watching destination in the world for sheer variety, with friendly grey whales in their breeding lagoons on the Pacific coast, singing humpback whales off the southern tip, and everything from blue whales to Bryde’s whales in the Sea of Cortez.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:00:23.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
