When we first started India back in the 1990s, we were forecasting that India would have about 300 airplanes over 20 years. Today, the forecast in India is nearly 1,700 airplanes for the next 20 years.\" \n\"So it's a very big market and the success that Airbus has had in India over the last few years, puts us at 80 percent market share in one of the most important markets in the world today.\" Bombardier ready to take on the big guns \nRao went on to add that he was confident that low-cost emerging market airlines were going to dominate global air trade by 2025; especially with carriers such as IndiGo giving people an opportunity to travel more. \nIndiGo has had a long history with the aircraft manufacturer. In 2005, the Indian airline placed an order for 100 A320s, and six years later, the company became the first Indian operator to pledge an order to Airbus' A320neo, in 2011. Now IndiGo has ordered a total of 530 A320 Family aircraft, according to Airbus' website. \nIndiGo's Ghosh told CNBC that he was \"very happy\" with the latest deal, and its relationship with Airbus will create even more stability and hopefully profitability for their business model. Airbus names first customer of A330 regional jet \nGhosh told CNBC that in the aircraft market, India was very \"under-penetrated\" with less than 400 commercial planes in the country. As a result the \"market potential is immense and the opportunity is starting right at us,\" but it's all down to who will take advantage of this opportunity. \n\"We are really building our business on the fundamental premise that in an under-penetrated market, with a lot of demand and very little supply; we want to be able to continue to grow. We're only nine years old, and within that time, we have just under 40 percent of India's market. That shows the sheer potential that this country holds.\" \nGhosh confirmed that Airbus would start delivering this latest batch to IndiGo from 2018 up until 2026; adding that the A320neo's fuel efficiency would have a \"very positive impact\" on their bottom line. \nShares in French listed firm, Airbus were up by as much as 1.9 percent in early trade, however, pared gains to trade 0.3 percent higher around 3 p.m. London time. \nâ€”By CNBC's Alexandra Gibbs, follow her on Twitter @AlexGibbsy.
