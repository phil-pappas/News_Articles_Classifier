These actions by the striking Andina workers interrupted both the shipments of copper concentrate and gold dore as well as the shipment of fuel oil into the Pimenton mine. This was followed by a snow storm which began on Saturday, August 8 to August 13th during which time approximately 2.60 meters of heavy wet snow fell at Pimenton, which caused the mine operations to be shut down for 3 days and the plant operations to be shut down, because of lack of fuel, until August 18th when the road was partially reopened.\nThe primary reason for the road closure is that Pimenton had a D5 level (15 meters in height and 235 meters along the road center line) avalanche mid way along the 80 kilometer road leading into Pimenton. A D5 avalanche on the US Destructive Scale, as described in the Standards for Weather and Avalanche Recording Guidelines for the U.S. as the most destructive of avalanches recorded in the U.S.\nThis series of events has adversely impacted operations at Cerro Grande Mining Corporation's 100% owned Pimenton mine and will have a negative impact on the Company's earnings in its fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30 th , 2015.\nCerro Grande Mining Corporation is a minerals producing, exploration and development company with properties and activities currently focused in Chile .\nCautionary Statement on Forward-looking Information:\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\", which may include, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the future financial or operating performance of CEG.
