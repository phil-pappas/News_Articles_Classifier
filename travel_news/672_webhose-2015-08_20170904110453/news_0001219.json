This is the first time that Travelguru makes its content available through a global distribution system, offering both leisure and corporate travellers access to a widespread choice of hotels through the travel agency channel.\nTravelguru’s hotel content will be available to agents in Q3 2015 through the extended marketplace in Amadeus Hotels Plus. This solution provides seamlessly integrated content from multiple hotel sources in one single interface. Travel agents can see hotel results in a standardised format, making comparison shopping quick and easy.\nHotels partnering with Travelguru will benefit from international reach through Amadeus’ global travel agency network. Travelguru will also offer dynamic commissions in the Amadeus solution, so that travel agents are guaranteed to have the most attractive commission available when booking a hotel for their customers.\nMr. Akash Poddar, Head of B2B Business, Travelguru said that global reach was a key factor in the decision to distribute their hotel content via Amadeus. “Amadeus’ true global network of travel agency customers means we can increase our sales channels. In addition Amadeus provides us with a globally adopted platform to engage with, and tap into, new markets which we previously could not reach. Domestically, this helps us to further consolidate our leadership position in the Indian sub-continent.”\nChristian Lukey, Head of Hotel Distribution, Amadeus Asia Pacific commented, “This partnership with Travelguru ensures that the whole spectrum of hotel properties in India from boutique to budget and high-end luxury hotels are now available to Amadeus travel agents. India is an increasingly popular destination, for both leisure and corporate travellers, so it’s fundamental that Amadeus travel agents can offer as many choices as possible to their customers.”\nThe inclusion of Travelguru’s Indian hotel content means that Amadeus travel agents will now be able to search, shop and book over 1 million hotel shopping options.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T09:46:15.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
