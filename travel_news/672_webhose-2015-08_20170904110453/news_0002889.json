Powered by a top-rated management team and loads of creative muscle, Giants Enterprises helps clients host one-of-a-kind experiences at AT&T Park, throughout San Francisco and across the country. Giants Enterprises has built one of the top hospitality, event, entertainment and sports consultancy teams in the world. \nDedicated to revenue generation via non-baseball activities, Giants Enterprises’ roster of services includes event production, campaign management, commercial development, catering, ticketing, marketing, public relations, and more. “We are thrilled to join ISES as a Global Partner and are excited for the numerous opportunities and exposure the program will provide us,” said Giants Enterprises Senior Vice President, Stephen Revetria. “As a proud past president of our local Northern California Chapter of ISES, I know the reach, relevance and creative inspiration that ISES provides its’ members and our industry. I am confident that our company will continue to grow and enjoy success as a Global Partner.” Giants Enterprises versatility and expertise in hosting large-scale, city-wide events has been on full display recently. In June the company partnered with The City of San Francisco to produce The City Hall Centennial, a civic celebration for more than 20,000 attendees featuring multiple stages with musical and artistic performances and a jaw-dropping multimedia light show on the façade of City Hall to highlight the evening. Giants Enterprises also produced the Opening Night Celebration for the 2015 Meeting Professionals International World Education Congress (MPI WEC). The Opening Night Reception, held on August 1st, featured the Bay Area’s finest gourmet cuisine, aerial acrobatics, live music, stunning Barbary Coast-themed décor, and mesmerizing talent. The reception drew praise from veteran attendees as one of the best Opening Nights in the history of MPI’s WEC. Over the 17 month partnership ISES will be working with Giants Enterprises to provide increased exposure to the global events industry through collaborative projects and participation in international events. The newly launched Global Partner Program will also allow the Giants Enterprises team to interact with the 5,000 members of ISES worldwide, and benefit from their global event spend of almost $22 billion. Commenting on the announcement of their latest Global Partner, Kevin White CSEP, International President of ISES says: “Giants Enterprises are long term and highly valued supporters of ISES and the global events industry and we look forward to working together for the mutual benefit of our members and our two organizations.” Giants Enterprises joins a growing list of global Partners that also includes HCC Specialty Insurance, CORT, AFR Rentals, Catersource: Event Solutions and Visit Scotland.
