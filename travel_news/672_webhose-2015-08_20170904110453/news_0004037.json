You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Shane Lin/Flickr \n…Mistaya Canyon! If you love the outdoors, seek out adventure, or just appreciate incredible natural beauty, this dream is for you. It’s no secret that Banff is one of the most breathtaking national parks in North America. Its 2,564 square miles are full of mountains, hot springs, forests, rivers, glaciers, and stunningly blue lakes . With incredible views and scenery lurking around every corner of the park, the fact that Mistaya Canyon is one of the most beloved spots says a lot. The Mistaya River flows into the canyon and you can watch the powerful falls rushing down the middle of its distinct curvy canyon walls. Easy accessibility (about a half-mile hike from the Icefields Parkway) makes it a a great spot for younger hikers and those simply less inclined towards arduous hikes. While Banff is wonderful and full of great things to do year-round, late spring and summer are when you should visit Mistaya Canyon as the trail gets very icy the rest of the year.
