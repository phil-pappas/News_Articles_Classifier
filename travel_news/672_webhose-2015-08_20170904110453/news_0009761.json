X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nWet and windy weather will blight parts of the UK today, continuing a disappointing Bank Holiday weekend. \nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning in London, the east, south-east, and south-west of England, alerting the public to “thundery downpours” ahead. \nUp to 25mm, or half a month of average rain, could fall in some areas, becoming increasingly heavy throughout the day before spreading to the North overnight. \nThe Met Office said: “Although not all areas will be affected, thundery showers or areas of heavy rain are likely to affect some southern and eastern parts of England late on Saturday evening and on Sunday. \n“The main focus for thundery downpours looks limited to the south-east corner of England overnight but then becomes rather more widespread during Sunday afternoon and evening. \n“Lightning may be an additional hazard. \n“The public should be aware of the risk of localised impacts from heavy rain and flooding, which may affect travel and some outdoor events.” \nKent will be among the areas which could see heavy localised rain, weather forecasters MeteoGroup added. \nSenior forecaster Clare Austin warned the rain would move north on Bank Holiday Monday into northern and eastern parts of England., \n“Next week looks like an improving picture with only one or two showers around but it will be cooler,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:11:06.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
