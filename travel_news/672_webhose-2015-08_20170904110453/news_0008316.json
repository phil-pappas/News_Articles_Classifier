Carly Ledbetter Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/21/2015 10:03 AM EDT \nSometimes lightning strikes, and sometimes you're lucky enough to catch it on film. That's what happened to Jack Perkins, the man behind the now-viral video above of lightning striking a Delta plane before takeoff. \nPerkins shot the video two days ago while he was at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport . He was \"filming the line of planes all stacked up during a ground hold,\" he wrote on YouTube, when he happened to document the exact moment lightning struck the Boeing 737 . As NBC \"Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt notes in the video above, planes are built to withstand lightening strikes. According to CNN, Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant confirmed the Las Vegas-bound flight was struck on Tuesday as it waited for takeoff, adding there were no injuries to the 117 passengers and crewmembers on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T17:37:31.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
