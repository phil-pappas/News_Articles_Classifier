She’ll spend the day quietly with her family at Balmoral in Scotland, but it’s cue for royally bonkers Britain to countdown to her official 90th birthday next June 12.\nTen thousand people will be invited to a giant street party to be held along The Mall from Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square. And there will be a National Service of Thanksgiving at St Pauls on June 10 and the Trooping the Colour birthday parade at Horse Guards on the 11th.\nOther Stories Mum’s partner held over tot’s death News Gallen’s f-word rant at 10-year-old fan Nrl 0 comments Hayne takes the next, painful, step More Sports 0 comments NRL Fans Survey 2015: How you voted Nrl 0 comments Touchdown but no takeoff for Hayne Plane More Sports 0 comments ‘I’m having triplets ... so I can’t have sex’ Nsw 0 comments Outside London, there’ll be a bunting bonanza from Land’s End to John O’Groats, with streets and houses decorated in traditional red, white and blue triangular flags. June. At the 2012 Diamond Jubilee the small town of Ashbourne in Derbyshire managed to entwine its streets with eight miles of the stuff, and Randwick in Gloucestershire set a new world record for the longest line of continuous line of 14,583 triangular flags.\nVisiting the UK anytime between now and the big birthday is the perfect opportunity to delve into Royal Britain — so from castles to coaches, tea rooms to tennis courts, here are 20 ideas for a right royal trip.\n News_Image_File: Band performing during The Changing of the Guard ceremony taking place in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace, Westminster. Picture: Visit Britain\nBuckingham Palace\nLondon\nThe palace occupies a plum spot in London and a soft spot in British hearts. Royal appearances on its balcony have marked family occasions and national celebrations since anyone can remember — newlyweds kiss on it, newborns are held aloft on it, and RAF planes fly past it. If the Queen’s at home the Royal Standard flies over its 775 rooms and 800 staff; if she’s not the Union Jack is flown. State rooms are open August-September and the Changing the Guard ceremony is year round (daily at 11.30am May-July: alternate days otherwise). Outside of Royal occasions, the busby-bonnetted military band delights the crowds with everything from the Dam Busters March, Abba’s greatest hits, even the theme from the Game of Thrones.\nSee royalcollection.org.uk\nWestminster Abbey\nLondon\nCommissioned by Edward the Confessor and consecrated six days before he died in 1066, the Abbey has seen all but two coronations since. At the Queen’s coronation in 1953 her robes were so weighty that she asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to give her a push, saying, “Get me started”. Its glorious gothic interiors have also seen 16 royal weddings, including the Queen’s marriage to the Duke of Edinburgh and the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nSee westminster-abbey.org\nCoach and horses\nLondon\nJust behind Buckingham Palace, the Royal Mews is the perfect place to placate your little princesses. It’s home to royal carriages and cars, and unfeasibly large horses — eight of which are needed to pull the fantastical four-ton Gold State Coach. Bad reviews from Queen Victoria (who griped about its “distressing oscillation”) and William IV (who likened it to being aboard a ship in rough seas) haven’t stopped it been wheeled out for every coronation since 1821. Look out for the Australian State Coach and Diamond Jubilee State Coach — both with sensible suspension and electric windows, made by WJ Frecklington of Sydney.\nSee royalcollection.org.uk\n News_Image_File: Horse-drawn carriage outside The Goring Hotel in London, where the Duchess of Cambridge spent her last night as single woman Kate Middleton.\nHorses for courses\nAscot and Windsor\nFrom the grumpy look on her face during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics you’d think the Queen loathes sport. But you’d be wrong — she’s always animated and beaming at the races. Her lifelong love of horses started when her grandad George VI gave her a shetland pony called Peggy when she was four, and today she attends Royal Ascot ( ascot.co.uk ), the Royal Windsor Horse Show ( rwhs.co.uk ) and is a keen horse owner and breeder. William and Harry aren’t into racing like their gran, but do play polo at Cirencester ( cirencesterpolo.co.uk ).\n News_Image_File: The Tootsie Rollers take a selfie at Royal Ascot. Picture: Getty\nAfternoon tea\nLondon\nThe Queen included a handwritten scone recipe in a letter to US President Eisenhower after his visit to Balmoral in 1959. The same recipe is followed precisely for Royal Afternoon Tea in the St James’ Court Hotel ( stjamescourthotel.co.uk ). The silver cake stand groans with traditional finger sandwiches, including Coronation Chicken (concocted for the Queen’s 1953 crowning), miniature Victoria sponge cakes and white chocolate crowns. From September 14 the Hotel Café Royal ( hotelcaferoyal.com ) will serve a new London Royal (afternoon) Tea in its opulent Oscar Wilde Bar.\n News_Image_File: 24-carat gold dining at the St James Court Hotel. Picture: St James Court Hotel\nRoyal yacht\nLeith, Edinburgh\nThe current monarch has launched 23 ships, including Cunard’s eponymous QE2 and the navy’s aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, though no vessel has been closer to her heart than Royal Yacht Britannia. The 126m vessel was built in 1953 and made almost 700 foreign visits — including a dozen to Australia — before finally mooring in Edinburgh as a tourist attraction. The Royal quarters are stately and the afternoon tea on deck is tiptop.\nSee royalyachtbritannia.co.uk\nRoyal shopping\nWhether providing pianos or port, shortbread or soap, companies that supply the royal household display the Royal Warrant crest. Few are quirkier than Ulster Weavers ( ulsterweavers.com ), who have a warrant to supply the Queen with tea towels, though probably not of the royal celebration souvenir variety. A great warrant holder to visit is Fortnum & Mason ( fortnumandmason.com ) on London’s Piccadilly: it’s the grandest of grocery stores, has supplied the Royal Family for more than 300 years and is famous for picnic and Christmas hampers — even inventing the Scotch egg for its portability. Browse 800 warrant holders at royalwarrant.org .\nElizabethan Old Hat\nHertfordshire\nThe 25-year-old daughter of decapitated Anne Boleyn and deceased Henry VIII was sitting under an oak tree at Hatfield House when she learnt she’d become Queen Elizabeth I. The house was her childhood home and its 15th-century Great Hall is where she held her first Council of State. On display are gloves, stockings and a hat believed to be hers, and a regal “Rainbow Portrait” painted in 1600. There are monthly banquets in the Great Hall, and the Folk by the Oak festival ( folkbytheoak.com ) is on June 24 next year.\nSee hatfieldghouse.co.uk\nTea at the Blitz\nHebden Bridge, Yorkshire\nAt the Blitz Tea Room ( feathergills.co.uk ) in Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire you’re invited to soak up cheery nostalgia for 1940s Britain. Read newspapers from the era while Vera Lyn warbles on the gramophone and friendly khaki-wearing staff serve blitz rarebit and Churchill pie, with Queen Elizabeth cake and ginger pudding. Also worth dropping in on are the Blitz Tea Room and Jazz Lounge in Kettering ( the-blitz.com ) and Brighton’s TeaCosy Tea Room ( theteacosy.co.uk ).\n News_Image_File: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall leave the Highgrove shop on Tetbury High Street. Picture: Getty\nHighgrove House\nGloucestershire\nWhen not away eco-warrioring, Prince Charles relaxes at his Cotswold country residence. The lovely grounds are a sustainable showcase open to the public — including the walled kitchen garden, wildflower meadow, and a Carpet Garden designed by the prince with an Islamic-style fountain, Indian chair and Arabian wooden doors. Profits from organic produce grown on the estate sold in the shop go to The Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation. Waitrose supermarkets stock his Duchy Originals brand across the country.\nSee highgroveshop.com\nDiana’s London\nKensington Palace ( hrp.org.uk ) overlooks Hyde Park, where thousands of bouquets were left following the death of Diana Princess of Wales in 1997. She lived in Apartment 8 and although her rooms aren’t open to the public, the Fashion Rules exhibition shows off some of her dresses until January 4. Diana fans should also visit St Paul’s (wedding) and Westminster Abbey (funeral). Sloane St, Bond St and the Fulham Rd were her favourite shopping strips.\nWindsor life\nBerkshire\nWindsor Castle is the largest and oldest occupied castle in the world. Don’t miss the magnificent late-Georgian State Apartments, 15th-century St George’s Chapel (where 10 monarchs are buried), and the Queen Mary’s Dolls’ House — designed by Edwin Lutyens, better known for his work on Commonwealth war graves and New Delhi. And stay sharp eyed in Windsor Great Park as you may see the Queen scoot by in a Range Rover, or the indefatigable Prince Philip riding a horse and trap.\nSee royalcollection.org.uk\nThe Goring\nLondon\nJust a corgi’s walk from Buckingham Palace and run by the same family since it was built in 1910, The Goring is the only hotel with a royal warrant from the Queen. Kate Middleton stayed here before her wedding in 2011, and it was home from home for the Queen Mother, who died in 2002 at the age of 101. Her favourite dish, Eggs Drumkilbo (seafood cocktail in aspic), is still on the menu.\nSee thegoring.com\nHenry’s tennis court\nSurrey\nIt’s a cinematic cliche to see Henry VIII chomping his way through chicken drumsticks, but he sure liked his food. He extended the kitchen at Hampton Court, his west London riverside palace, to cover 55 rooms and employ 200 staff. Meat stock was boiled up in 75-gallon pots and 600,000 gallons of ale were quaffed annually. Hampton is also home to Henry’s Real Tennis court (a forerunner of the game we know to day, but with walls to bounce balls off, similar to squash) and the world’s oldest hedge maze.\nSee hrp.org.uk\nTower of London\nLondon\nSince William the Conqueror began the White Tower in 1078, it’s been extended and added to in a mishmash of styles. The Beefeater guided tours are amusing, the crown jewels bedazzling, and kids love the grisly fact that this is where Henry VIII’s wives Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, and Lady Jane Grey, Sir Walter Raleigh and countless others were executed.\nSee hrp.org.uk\n News_Image_File: Balmoral Castle, residence of the British Royal Family since 1852. Picture: Getty\nBalmoral\nAberdeenshire, Scotland\nThe Queen (2006) and Mrs Brown (1997) movies were both set in and around Balmoral, but the Queen guards her family’s summer holiday castle closely and they were filmed elsewhere. You can visit, but the grounds and the ballroom, but even outside of the family’s August rendezvous, other rooms are out of bounds. Yet with its rich history and 20,000ha of lochs and glens, any visit is special. And when the royals are away, you too can pull on a pair of green wellies and stalk stags in the sunset by renting one of six holiday cottages in the grounds. Open April to July.\nSee balmoralcastle.com\nRestaurateur to the Royals\nLondon\nAnton Mosimann has cooked for four generations of Royals and holds a Warrant of Appointment for catering to Prince Charles. Mosimann’s restaurant created the wedding breakfast for Prince William and the then Kate Middleton, and his nine-room private dining club is a Belgravia institution. A four-course meal will set you back a princely £300.\nSee mosimann.com\nA gold mine\nWales\nThe Romans mined gold from the hills of west Wales some 2000 years ago and the coronet placed on Edward XX Prince of Wales at his 1911 investiture in Caernarfon Castle was made entirely from it. It’s a lot scarcer these days, but royal wedding rings are still fashioned from Welsh gold. You can tour pits and pan for gold at the Dolaucothi Gold Mine in the Cothi Valley. See nationaltrust.org.uk\n News_Image_File: Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, Queen Victoria&apos;s holiday retreat. Picture: Getty\nOsborne House\nIsle of Wight\nQueen Victoria is often thought of as solely being unamused while dressed in mourning black. But catch a ferry to the Isle of Wight and a more joyful side to her is revealed. Osborne House was the holiday home designed by her beloved Prince Albert; here she collected shells on the beach, made sketches of the sea and sometimes swam twice a day. You’ll see the restored “bathing machine” — a changing room on rails that once ran into the sea to protect the monarch’s modesty. Osborne was sealed up for 50 years after Victoria’s death in 1901, aged 81, but is now open to the public year round.\nSee english-heritage.org.uk\nStand on ceremony\nThe Queen makes almost 400 public engagements a year and you can search her out — and 16 other members of the family — up to eight weeks in advance at royal.gov.uk . The Queen’s actual birthday is April 21, which is celebrated privately, but large screens in nearby parks are planned for her official birthday bash.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e31bb975931edd8fedeb4ce06a4ba010", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ef675571cce4825e1079c3feb04e3f87", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/50a3560ec59c4d06b49c6381f1ec6019", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/bcd1243a145142ea949f54e19b2677cc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a31be1732f6ea3e0b3de6b6bd37f7238", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/401eb86574c08374c1cd650faff2f376"], "published": "2015-08-28T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T11:54:54.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
