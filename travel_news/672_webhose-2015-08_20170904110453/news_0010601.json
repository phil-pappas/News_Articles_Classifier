This will improve Philippine connectivity and also the commercial viability of our routes to the UAE,” Arcilla said. \nSaudi Arabia and the UAE are among the top two destination countries of overseas Filipino workers, while the US and UK are home to millions of immigrant Filipinos. \nHuge demand \nCurrently, an estimated 850,000 Filipinos live and work in the UAE. \nArcilla said the parties also agreed on \"co-terminalization\", which allows an airline from one country to fly to a city in the other country and onward to another city in that country without picking up passengers in the domestic leg. \n“Overall, the [air] talks is a success for Philippine connectivity and network development. The Philippine government panel and our airlines view the exchange as more or less fair, as the increase in traffic rights for both sides, which our airlines opposed, is minimal, and we also got unilateral concessions for the increase, in terms of subjecting the operation of the additional traffic rights by the UAE carriers, on the operation of services to Clark or Cebu,” Arcilla said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T19:50:19.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
