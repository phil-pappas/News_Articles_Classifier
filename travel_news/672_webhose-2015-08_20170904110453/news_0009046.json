Visitors to the event, put on in a disused swimming pool, can have a souvenir photo taken in Cinderella's Castle against a backdrop of a dead princess in a coach crash, while surly stewards carry bunches of balloons labelled \"I'm an imbecile\". Banksy, whose identity has never been revealed, described it as \"a festival of art, amusements and entry-level anarchism\". \"It's not a swipe at Disney,\" he said in a press release. \"I banned any imagery of Mickey Mouse from the site. It's a showcase for the best line-up of artists I could imagine, apart from the two who turned me down.\" TOBY MELVILLE \nA sculpture at the park features a model pensioner engulfed in seagulls. \nThe site, whose signage bares more than a passing resemblance to Disneyland, is full of the artist's subversive statements and epigrams on Western culture, the media, capitalism and extreme disparities of wealth. \nA model pensioner is engulfed in seagulls, a reference to a media panic about how aggressive birds had become this summer in the UK, while the merry-go-round horse, destined to become lasagne, harks back to a food scandal sparked by the presence of horsemeat in supermarket ready meals. \nBanksy's works, which have been stencilled on locations ranging from London and New York to the West Bank and Gaza, have become highly sought after in the art world he satirises. Collectors, who include pop star Christina Aguilera and actor Brad Pitt, have paid as much as US$500,000 ($755,000) for pieces of his work. Local authorities, which routinely painted over his graffiti a decade ago, also now recognise the value. The local North Somerset Council said it was right behind \"Dismaland\", mindful of a show in nearby Bristol that attracted more than 300,000 fans from around the world in 2009. \"We were absolutely delighted to have the biggest drawing name in art here,\" council leader Nigel Ashton said. Ashton, who is a member of Britain's ruling Conservatives, was not put off by any anti-authority theme. \"There's nothing wrong with asking provocative questions,\" he said.

Ad Feedback \nWhile not quite \"The happiest place on earth\", \"Dismaland\" is generating a buzz in the resort and a lot of excitement from locals and Banksy fans worldwide. \n\"I've been curious all week,\" said Dana Winestone, 21, who works in a cafe on the seafront. \"I'm just excited, it will be the best exhibition out there.\" \n\"Dismaland\" opens to locals on Friday, and the general public from Saturday, until Sept. 27 at the low entry price of Â£3 pounds ($7). - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T03:28:08.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
