We are thrilled to be working with over 30 venues across the City, and further a field, hosting in excess of 450 artists in over 70 events.\n\"It has been a pleasure to dream up and realise this project with Bryce Dessner and we look forward to showing off our amazing city to him and so many more national and international artists over the 4 days in September.\"\nAs well as Wild Beasts, headliners include The Gloaming, Aaron Dessner and Lisa Hannigan, Bryce Dessner, Richard Reed Parry (Arcade Fire) and the RTE National Symphony Orchestra.\nOther festival highlights include a Music Trail curated by new Irish music writer and blogger, Nialler9.
