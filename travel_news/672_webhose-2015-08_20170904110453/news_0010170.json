Photographer's Note \nEstação Mall was opened in 1997 in an annex building to the Railway Museum, which brings together the memory of the old train station of Curitiba, attracting audiences with an extensive list of attractions. Located in Batel and surrounded by large avenues, the project has become a reference in the city. It went through its first expansion and revitalization in 2002. In 2007 it was acquired by BRMALLS group, the largest shopping mall company in Brazil. Currently operates as a shopping center without losing its leisure heritage, presenting several options for entertaining family and friends.
