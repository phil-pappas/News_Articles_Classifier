VenueReporter can help By Jen Leo Tribune News Service, Los Angeles Times Posted: 08/05/2015 03:00:00 PM PDT Updated: 08/07/2015 08:45:51 AM PDT VenueReport.com gets the party rolling with a curated list of event venues in 615 cities around the world. (VenueReport.com) Destination celebrations WHAT: VenueReport.com helps get the party rolling with a curated list of venues in 615 cities in 63 countries. Venues include estates, hip boutique hotels, restaurants, farmhouses, campgrounds, resorts, big-city apartments and more. \nHITS: If you're planning a gathering for a big birthday, family reunion, wedding, workshop or year-end planning session, brag-worthy locations are waiting for you. Because the site has the look of a travel magazine rather than a resource list, the upfront mention of venue capacity will save you lots of time when planning a party for eight or 2,000. \nMISSES: Prices are visible only after you sign in, which is free with an email address or Facebook. If price is a concern, use the sort button to filter by fees. Also, if you are looking for venues by region, you'll have a tough time. I couldn't find a map or menu that listed venues by country. -- Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:07:02.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
