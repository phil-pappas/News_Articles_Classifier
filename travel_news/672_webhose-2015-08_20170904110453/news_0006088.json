The WPA wants motorists who will be spending several hours downtown to use parkades or parking lots, freeing up on-street parking for motorists doing appointments or meals at a restaurant.\nThe WPA found motorists were willing to pay the higher rate for the convenience of being closer to their destination -- but only for a short time.\n\"We wanted to ensure we had two pricing regimes that allow for the high-demand areas to be priced well enough to encourage motorists to go to an off-street surface lot or a parkade, rather than parking on street for their longer-term requirements,\" Williams said.\n\"We wanted to have a vacancy rate of 15 per cent, allowing nine out of 10 motorists to find on-street parking without having to (circle) the block looking for their short-term requirements,\" she said.\nThe strategy was approved by city council in 2012, allowing the WPA to set higher rates on streets where motorists were staying the longest.\nThe WPA carried out a pilot study on the demand-based pricing from 2008 to 2010 at St. Boniface Hospital and Health Sciences Centre and found it had the desired effect of moving long-term parkers off the street.\nBrian Timmerman, executive director of the Exchange District Business Improvement Zone, said business owners were worried increasing the rate to $2 an hour at some meters would scare customers away, but he said the WPA's strategy worked.\n\"We haven't had a complaint about parking since they changed the rates,\" Timmerman said. \"Some of our businesses have said (the higher rate) has allowed them to operate in a more efficient manner.\n\"They are seeing the turnover, (customers) are coming in for 10 minutes and then go.\"\nWhen the WPA presented its business plan for the demand-based pricing, it argued setting higher rates for the most popular areas would encourage motorists to use off-street locations; but by keeping the majority of on-street parking spaces at $1 per hour, it would act as a hedge against private-lot owners from jacking up prices by too much.\nWilliams said the experience of the past four years demonstrates the strategy has worked.\n\"There has been improved availability on the street,\" Williams said. \"We're getting that turnover that we wanted to be seeing.\n\"They're not staying as long (at the $2-per-hour spaces), and we're assuming more people are making more use of the off-street locations.\"\nThe WPA has had mixed results with its on-street parking strategy. While the two-price strategy appears to be working, restaurant employees and visitors to the MTS Centre continue to be blamed for hogging on-street parking in the early evening.\nThe WPA has approached city hall with plans to open up on-street parking in the evening, but council has not been willing to adopt them. The most recent proposal was to limit free parking after 5:30 p.m. to two hours, requiring motorists to move before they'd be towed or ticketed. That plan was shelved in July.\naldo.santin@freepress.mb.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:00:36.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
