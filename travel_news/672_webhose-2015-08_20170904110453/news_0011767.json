It’s open daily, and on a sunny summer day, it may compel as many as 1,500 visitors to peel off U.S. 395 and head up California Route 270 for 10 miles, where the pavement turns to dirt and the clock begins to wind back.\nBut this shockingly undisturbed municipal relic will only be available for a limited time. Age and the extreme climate are wearing it down.\nIn its heyday, Bodie had a population of more than 10,000, a full-scale gold and silver mining operation, and every support facility a proper California mining town needed.\nThere were bars, barber shops, banks, schools, hotels and churches, all in a valley with an unforgiving climate. The town’s heartbeat was a structure that loomed like an architectural and economic overlord: the Standard Mill.\nNow Bodie, left for dead nearly 50 years ago, melts away under the watchful eye of California State Parks, which took over the town in 1962 and considers it to be in a state of arrested decay. Buildings, homes, even the mill and the Standard Mine, have been left to endure the harsh winters and relentless sun. Some structures have fared better than others; those with roofs and ceilings intact have fared the best.\n“I’ve been here when we’ve had 100 mile-an-hour winds,” said Robert Peek, a California State Park Ranger based at Bodie. “There’s rain and sun and snow, but it’s the wind that does the most damage. Some of these buildings are just barely standing.”\nThe area that eventually became Bodie was happened upon by William (a.k.a. Waterman) S. Bodey, who perished in 1859 just months after discovering gold on Bodie Bluff. Bodey and his mining partner, “Black Taylor,” became separated in a snowstorm. His remains were found the following spring. Lore has it his skull ended up on the back counter of the Cosmopolitan Bar.\nSome of the best-preserved structures were some of the town’s most important spaces. The Methodist church, despite missing its bell, hasn’t changed too much since it held its last service in 1932. The Wheaton & Hollis Hotel lobby is still filled with steamer trunks. The schoolhouse’s desks still face the teacher’s desk at the head of the class, lesson book open.\nThe garage is still stocked with parts, hardware store shelves are full and empty bottles still sit on the bar in the saloon, all covered with deep layers of dust.\nSome houses have been reduced to shells, their floors buckling and door frames splintering. Others, just as old and just as decayed, still contain family possessions: rusty bed springs, rotting dressers and peeling wallpaper.\nSome still contain kitchen appliances, along with dining-room furnishings, beds, bedside tables and another staple of the times, sewing machines.\nWhen the town finally does crumble, one of the American West’s toughest, meanest, bawdiest and hardest-working towns will be gone. Bodie’s stories of debauchery are legendary, and set the bar for what’s commonly referred to as the Wild West.\nA visiting mining engineer complained his sleep was being interrupted in his hotel room by bullets from the tap house below.\nAfter Joseph DeRoche shot a popular townsman in the head following a dance in January of 1881, the 601 Vigilante group (six feet under, zero trials, one rope) demanded DeRoche be released from jail for hanging. He was released and was promptly hanged.\nShootings, stabbings, drunken brawls, revelry and prostitution were common. With 65 saloons and two churches at its peak, it’s clear what the local priorities were.\nThe town’s graveyard is a tour within a tour, with stones documenting the mayhem, fires, harsh weather, murder, mining accidents and diseases that made up life — and death — in Bodie.\nBetween 1932 and 1962, the town slowly ceased to be viable. When it became a state historic park in 1962, only a few straggling residents were hanging on to their properties.\nDuring those years, the town lost the Methodist church bell, the church’s Ten Commandments tapestry and the firehouse’s bell to thieves and vandals. The firehouse bell was returned in 1941, but there has been no such miracle for the Methodist church.\nPoachers surely absconded with other items too, but Peek said the town remains relatively undisturbed because J.S. Cain, patriarch of the town’s most prominent clan and its biggest landowner, had armed security on the streets year-round.\nIn the time California State Parks has been in charge, a few key buildings have gotten newer roofs or patches. But they, too, must now face Mother Nature on their own.\nThe mill itself will likely, and perhaps appropriately, be the last structure standing. Its current wood-frame structure wrapped in corrugated steel is a modified version of the original structure, which, like much of Bodie, met its demise through fire.\nThe town is perched above the timberline, which made wood and its transportation to Bodie from the Mono Basin the second-most important industry in the area behind mining. Wood construction was preferred over stone, because the mortar of the day couldn’t take the Bodie climate, and wood was also the primary source of heat. The obvious downside was wood’s vulnerability to fire.\nBlazes in 1884, 1892, 1928 and 1932 significantly altered the cityscape. The structures standing today were the only ones to survive the ’32 inferno, which sent many of the town’s remaining citizens in search of greener, and perhaps calmer, pastures.\nThe country’s World War II priorities also helped drain the life from Bodie.\n“They only mined gold and silver here, and there were other minerals needed for the war effort,” Peek says. “So that drove a lot of people away.”\nA few more weeks of relatively peaceful summer will soon give way to the brute force of another Mono County winter. Some of the weaker structures are bound to absorb more damage.\nWhich presents the distinct possibility that the Bodie visitors see this summer will be different next summer, and the summer after. A little more worn down. A little smaller. A little more vulnerable. A little closer to becoming a memory.\nMatt McKay is a freelance writer based in Idyllwild, Calif.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T08:57:51.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
