It was 1976 and my father Dave loaded my big brother, Allen, and I into his 1939 Ford street rod. Away we went on the first of what has since become countless Minnesota adventures.\nThat inaugural road trip included my very first stay at the luxurious (to my eight-year-old eyes) Holiday Inn. Not only did kids eat free, but there was also a swimming pool right outside of our room and a maid magically made up our room each day while we were checking out the big car show at the Minnesota State Fair Grounds.\n\nWilly Williamson / winnipeg free press \nCP\nAP Photo/Jim Mone The Mall of America, top and above, is the most visted mall in the world. \nSince that first trip I've had the good fortune to travel across America from sea to shining sea, but the Twin Cities has always been my favourite U.S. travel destination. I've returned there annually for the better part of the last 40 years.\nOne of the biggest reasons why I return is because of the absolutely amazing friends I've made there. Manitobans and Minnesotans may talk a bit differently -- we say EH and they say YOU BET, but we share many of the same interests, including a love of the great outdoors, strong agricultural roots and above all a genuine hospitable nature that greets visitors with open arms.\nWhile we did manage to take in the annual Back to the 50's car show, (more on that later), the main reason for our journey this year was to shop until we dropped. On the surface heading across the border to shop with our meager Canadian dollars may not seem very fiscally responsible, however, with my wife, Melanie, a seasoned bargain hunter and coupon clipper at the helm, we were able to find everything we needed and even more stuff we didn't, at great prices.\nOur first two days of shopping were reserved for the Mall of America in Bloomington, 16 kilometres south of Minneapolis. We stayed two nights at the Radisson Blu Mall of America, a massive and modern luxury hotel with 500 guest rooms and suites. The hotel features fashion-inspired decor and is conveniently connected to the Mall of America. The Radisson Blu served as the perfect resting spot after long days of shopping. It had been a few years since we'd visited Mall of America and we were pleasantly surprised by the recent updates both in terms of the mall's overall look and atmosphere, as well as the vast array of national chain stores and unique independent retailers. Opened in 1992, the mall receives more than 40 million visitors annually, the most of any mall in the world.\nWhile our toddler is now a senior at University of Winnipeg, spending a couple of days in the mall is always an enlightening experience. Excited children revel in the many amenities clearly geared toward them. Nickelodeon Universe, located in the centre of the mall, features seven acres of attractions, entertainment and exciting rides. Other family destinations include a huge LEGO store, a Star Trek exhibition, a nightly light show and 14 movie theatres.\nMelanie and I opted to visit the all-new Sea-Life Minnesota Aquarium. This interactive exhibit features thousands of sea creatures, including sharks, sea turtles, rays, jellyfish, seahorses and more. The recent $2.2 million expansion -- dubbed Stingray Adventure!, features a 45,000 litre pool loaded with stingrays guests of all ages can touch and feed. It was a nice break from shopping and we enjoyed checking it out almost as much as the hundreds of kids in attendance.\nWe capped off our final evening at the mall with dinner at the new Hard Rock Cafe Mall of America. If you haven't experienced a Hard Rock you owe it to yourself to check it out. We dined there on a Thursday evening and were serenaded by the soothing sounds of local trumpet player Jeff Carver. Fellow diners shouted out requests and Carver answered the call with his unique takes on a number of hits ranging from jazz classics to modern rock.\nFrom the divine accommodations at the Radisson Blu Mall of America hotel, to the shopping and dining, we were left with the feeling a trip to Bloomington and the mall is a terrific getaway in itself, but, the big city was still calling our names!\nFor the Friday and Saturday leg of our five-day vacation we stayed at the Radisson Blu Minneapolis Downtown. This recently renovated hotel is in the heart of downtown and conveniently surrounded by restaurants, nightlife and more shopping. The Radisson Blu Downtown is also a short drive to the Minnesota State Fair Grounds. Although the annual Back to the Fifties car show takes place all weekend, we attended only on the Friday. Even if you're not a hardcore auto buff, it's hard not to get caught up in the excitement. Minnesota boasts a thriving classic and special interest vehicle hobby and during the Back to the 50's weekend it is amplified to the max. The streets of both Minneapolis and St. Paul are jam packed with old cars painted in bright colours and within the fair grounds more than 12,000 classic cars with build dates from 1964 or older are flanked by thousands of car owners and spectators. There's also a huge assortment of vendors set up each year selling not only automotive related parts and accessories, but also funky clothing and merchandise from the fabulous '50s. Although I could have surely spent the entire weekend sitting in a lawn chair gawking at old cars, attending the car show for only one day rather than our usual three day motoring marathon had its merits, we still managed to hook up with our many friends from Minnesota and enjoyed a sun-filled day, but we didn't wear ourselves out trudging through the heat.\nWith the car show in our rear view mirror we awoke early on Saturday for more shopping. Melanie had done her homework online and was excited to check out the fairly new Twin Cities Premium Outlets mall in nearby Egan. Located just a few minutes drive from Mall of America and about 20 minutes from downtown Minneapolis, this shopping destination is owned by the same company (Simon Premium Outlets), as the popular Albertville Premium Outlets. As I mentioned earlier, now may seem like a terrible time to go shopping south of the border, but despite the high exchange rate we were still able to find some great deals. Case in point occurred at the Reebok outlet store, where we were able to purchase two pairs of shoes each and a couple of Winnipeg Jets T-shirts for the grand sum of US$100. Melanie, of course, had a coupon. Throughout the day we also ducked in and out of a number of big-box stores where we made purchases that included several pairs of cheap (don't tell her) sunglasses for our daughter, Katelyn, who was left at home with grandma doggysitting our mastiff Rockford.\nOn Saturday evening we headed to our favourite Minneapolis restaurant, Best Steak House, nothing fancy here, just a cafeteria style spot that serves up the best T-bone in the land. Both reasonably priced and just quaint enough to keep us coming back, we fueled up on steak, baked potatoes and Texas toast before heading back to the posh lounge in the Radisson Blu Minneapolis Downtown hotel for a nightcap or three.\nWe were up early on Sunday and on the road home, but not before a stop at the Albertville Premium Outlets, where even more great deals were found. On the ride home Melanie and I both agreed that despite all the interesting spots we've been throughout the States there's just something perfectly right about visiting the Twin Cities. Combine world class accommodations, amazing restaurants and great shopping with the hospitable folks who call Minnesota home and you're guaranteed a terrific getaway. Just be prepared to be reminded you say EH... often.\n\nwilly@freepress.mb.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:31:26.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
