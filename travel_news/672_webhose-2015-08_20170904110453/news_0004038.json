When it became clear that you followed all the procedures, United should have made this its problem, not yours. \nThis case is particularly puzzling given the special attention the Department of Transportation pays to the needs of disabled travelers. It even has a special category for disability complaints. I can't imagine United not bending over backward to get you on that plane with Aubie. \nYour case required a real-time resolution, so the conventional approach — sending an email to United and waiting for a reply — was not going to work. Otherwise, I'd recommend reaching out to one of the United Airlines executive contacts listed on my site ( www.elliott.org/company-contacts/united ). \nUnited's published policy is clear on this issue: Trained service animals are allowed in-cabin to accompany qualified customers with disabilities. United has a special \"service animals\" section on its site, which you appear to have followed. \nThis shows the importance of paperwork, particularly on a special request such as traveling with a service animal. You argued with a United representative over the airline's service-animal policy. Having that policy handy when you tried to check in, either as a printout or on your personal electronic device, might have helped move this along. I wasn't there when you tried to check in, so I don't know what was or wasn't said. But I do know that there's no substitute for having something in writing. \nI contacted United on your behalf. You received a message from the airline apologizing for its \"disservice,\" and it re-booked you on a plane the next day. \nChristopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine and a co-founder of the Consumer Travel Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for travelers.
