Hill walking might once have seemed like something your old geography teacher would do: a middle-aged pastime for nature-loving dullards. But times have changed – and it’s actually one of the best forms of exercise for a rejuvenated mind and body. Here’s why… 1. You'll see amazing views Pounding the treadmill in the gym may tone your thighs, but it’s not going to inspire your mind, when all there is to watch is Homes Under The Hammer or the jiggling buttocks of the bloke in front. When you go hill walking, you’re surrounded by wonderful vistas. You may find a sparkling river, waterfalls or suddenly come upon a view of mountains and the sea. The UK has glorious landscapes; from Cumbria and the Peak District to the Cairngorms, the Cotswolds and Snowdonia – wherever you are, a weekend in the hills is never far away. 2. You get to drink tea Other sports require isotonic drinks and carb-loading. In the hills, a flask of tea and some cheese sandwiches in foil will do fine, though you may want to invest in some Kendal mint cake, if you’re on an arduous stretch. 3. It's great for leg muscles While you’re taking in the views and passing the time of day with farmers, your legs will be toning up just as well as any serious cyclist’s. A six-hour hill walk, at two miles an hour, can burn up to 1,400 calories – that’s some decent food you can look forward to later. 4. It works in all weather “There’s no bad weather, only bad clothing” is true for hill walking, unless you’re likely to get lost in a thunderstorm. A good pair of boots, a map and a rainproof jacket should do the job, however – and if you have a dog, he or she won’t mind what the weather’s doing, either. 5. It's companionable Unlike team sports that pit you against your peers, or solitary running and swimming, hill walking can be highly social. Take your partner, a mate or the kids, and conversation (albeit slightly breathless) will flow. 6. It's cheap Aside from the initial cost of boots and a coat, hill walking is free. Thanks to the mass trespass of Kinder Scout, evil landowners are rarely permitted to annex Britain’s hills and mountains, meaning that as forms of exercise go, it’s one of the cheapest and most enjoyable there is. 7. You'll breathe fresh air Cooped up in an office all week, what better way could there be to blast the cobwebs into oblivion than striding over the dales like Heathcliff? Studies show that walking in the fresh air encourages problem-solving, reduces stress, lowers your chances of stroke or heart attack, and tackles depression. So get your boots on.
