What you’ve seen in 2013 and 2014… is those investments starting to pay dividends.” \nTravel Counsellors Group Ltd includes figures for worldwide operations as well as UK ones. \nAccording to the group accounts released at Companies House, the UK is responsible for around 82% of all turnover, with Europe comprising 11% and “other worldwide” 7%. \nByrne said Travel Counsellors would also likely see long-term benefits from its recent £2m advertising campaign, which saw the company appear on television for the first time in June. “It was a brand awareness campaign so it wasn’t in play to drive immediate direct response. We’ll see the benefits over this year and next year,” he said. \nLast year, private equity firm Equistone took a 60% stake in Travel Counsellors via Jersey-based company TC Holdco 1 Ltd. \nDavid Speakman, who founded the company back in 1994, is no longer listed as a director of the group and in July this year he formally stepped down as chairman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:42:13.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
