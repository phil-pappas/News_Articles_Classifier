Our new “Come to Croatia” campaign is focused on increasing awareness of Croatia’s splendid diversity that has made it a popular vacation spot for jet-setters, yachting enthusiasts, and travelers from all over the world seeking exploration, culture, outdoor adventure, and delectable Mediterranean culinary treats.”\nOn average this sun-soaked land basks in a splendid 2,600 hours of sunlight each year, earning it acclaim as one of Europe’s sunniest seaside settings. With 1,778 kilometers of coastline, plus more than one thousand offshore islands, Croatia is an attractive travel destination. Its capital city, Zagreb, is justly known as the “city of museums,” encompassing more museums per square foot than any other city across the globe. Along the Dalmatian Coast travelers will find exquisite towns and villages…from Dubrovnik to Split and beyond. Considered one of the best preserved medieval walled cities in the world, the Old City of Dubrovnik seems almost frozen in time. Here one can walk along the city’s walls, delve into its resonant cultural heritage, savor the flavors of the Mediterranean tasting the area’s food and wine, and make new friends as the warmth of the locals draw visitors into their world. Travelers to Split will enjoy the breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea and its architectural scenery, discovering its storied history dating back 17 centuries, shopping the open-air markets and experiencing the area’s trendy restaurants. For an equally exciting outdoor travel adventure, travelers can venture into the subterranean caves of Postojna and explore the breath-taking terraced lakes of Plitvice Lakes National Park.\n-- Exploring Croatia “At Your Own Pace” with Central Holidays --\nCentral Holidays is pleased to give travelers the opportunity to live the treasures of Croatia on their many travel programs offered including its \"Driving Through Croatia\" vacation package, featuring an 8-day adventure to Dubovnik, Split, Zadar, Opatija and Zagreb.
