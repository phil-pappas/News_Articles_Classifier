The rankings, which were published this week by the US News & World Report , included all the giants in the hotel business, including the likes of Wyndham, Hilton and Best Western. \nIf you’re a serious traveller and are looking for the best loyalty programme to adhere to, US News & World Report has the rundown on the best and worst hotel and airline rewards programmes. \nAccording to the results, Marriott hotels have the best loyalty programme. Marriott Rewards retained the top spot from last year. Guests can earn points in any of the affiliated hotels, including Ritz-Carlton or Renaissance Hotels. Members can even qualify a free night’s stay when they reserve four consecutive nights in a participating hotel, or use their points in exchange for spa treatments or restaurant meals. \n“Marriott offers diverse lodging options, an extensive network, generous extra membership perks and a low requirement for earning and redeeming free stays,” says Liz Weiss, US News & World Report’s travel editor. \nWyndham Hotels, took the second spot on the rankings, up from 7th position last year thanks to a change in its loyalty programme policy that allow members to redeem a night’s stay for a flat rate of 15,000 points. “The redemption rate is standard across all Wyndham hotels, plus members can use a combination of cash and points to book reduced room rates,” says Weiss. “As a result, loyalty members can rack up and redeem points for free stays quickly and easily.” \nRounding out the top five were Best Western, Club Carlson and IHG. \nThe list of rankings also focused on airlines and the advantages they present to their frequent flyers. Alaska Airlines’ Mileage Plan claimed the top spot, while last year’s winner, JetBlue, dropped to number four. This is due to a change in the methodology behind the rankings. US News & World Report now gives more weight to the ease of mileage redemption to recognise the increased importance of ease of earning flights, nights and membership benefits. \nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage came in second, followed by Southwest Airlines’ Rapid Rewards programme. Hawaiian Airlines took the fifth spot. — AFP Relaxnews pic More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:36:10.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
