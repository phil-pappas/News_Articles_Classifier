It opens Aug. 28 and features about 200 objects and artifacts from the museum's own collection, including leg irons and a 15th century punishment collar. Also on display will be the 1836 journal of a cotton plantation owner, a Ku Klux Klan robe dating to around 1920 and a program from the 1963 March on Washington. The museum said in an announcement Thursday that the exhibit is \"dedicated to the thousands of unknown lives given in the name of freedom and equality.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:48:47.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
