That means growth in local airfares outpaced the national average of 1.7 percent, according to the latest federal data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The average airfare for a domestic flight leaving from Milwaukee in the first quarter was $374.42, up $17.95 from the same period in 2014, compared with the national average of $388. The airport has often been marketed as a cheaper alternative to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport , but that gap narrowed in the first quarter as O'Hare's average dropped 6 percent to match the national average. That could lead to a decrease in the number of passengers at the airport if travelers choose O'Hare instead of Mitchell. \nWant Milwaukee Travel news in your inbox?
