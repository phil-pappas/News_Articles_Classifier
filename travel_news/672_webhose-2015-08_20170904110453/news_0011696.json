Each couple bought identical New York apartments and decorated them exactly the same. The intention was to split the year into four quarters and rotate the primary parenting duties among themselves.\nThe complex plan was intended “so that they could all parent the child or children in some meaningful way,” the lawyer said. “They were good people and they loved this child, but within nine months the experiment collapsed.”\nBender represented one of the women.\n“We walked into the courtroom, and the judge was reading the petition. I’ll never forget the look on the judge’s face,” Bender says. “She looked up and looked at the parties, and she looked at me and said: ‘Counsel, explain.’ ”\nBLIND DECISIONS\nMarriage isn’t the only legal procedure getting a makeover by same-sex couples. When gay families break up, custody fights sometimes require a lot of explanation — and new precedent in the courts.\nAs more of these cases are resolved, it may end up changing the custody cases of straight couples as well.\nIn the past, judges often favoured mothers in heterosexual custody cases. But that’s changed in recent decades, lawyers say, as fathers have pushed for more rights. As same-sex custody cases become more common, it may encourage judges to be more gender-blind.\n“It’s always been my feeling that same-sex marriage is going to revolutionise the court system,” said family lawyer Sari Friedman.\nJudges “have traditional perspectives of roles. When they have two divorcing mothers in front of them, and they can’t fall back on figuring out what they feel is right based on gender, I think that they’re going to find different solutions.”\nWhen it’s Mum v. Mum, judges “focus more on the parties and how they live their lives and how they each were involved,” she said.\nGenetics don’t even necessarily tip the scale. With lesbian couples, whether one is a birth mother and the other is an adoptive mum hasn’t mattered in the cases Bender has seen. In the quadrangle case she handled, the female who actually carried the child didn’t have an advantage in court — the judge was simply interested in who would be the best primary caretaker now.\n“It has been my experience that biology does not win out,” Bender said.\nTHREE’S A CROWD\nA case playing out in New York now illustrates how complicated some modern custody cases have become.\nTwo men, longtime partners, agreed to have children using the sperm of one of the men and eggs from the sister of the other, who served as a surrogate and had several older children of her own.\nThe two dads, kids and mum were one big happy unit — until they weren’t.\nThe cases can tear families apart, says lawyer Sheila Callahan O’Donnell, who called the bitter custody conflict described above “a human tragedy.”\nFormal surrogacy is not legally recognised in New York State, so in this case, the trio signed an agreement, meant to ensure the sister would always be a part of the children’s lives, O’Donnell said.\nBut the men never married, and over the years the man whose sister carried the children to term didn’t legally adopt, the lawyer said, calling it “an issue they didn’t pursue.”\nSo when the biological father decided to end the relationship and move the children, now about 5 years old, out of state, his partner was left without a legal claim to the kids his sister bore for him. The lawyer is fighting to get the partner recognised as a “psychological parent,” and the three sides are now battling in court.\n“He’s getting a really raw deal …[and] the birth mother, the sister, is being treated as if she doesn’t exist,” the Cornwall-based lawyer said. “It’s not as if she decided to carry children for a stranger. She did it for her brother. So the biological dad has stolen the children, and so far the system has worked for him.”\nThree is often a crowd in court, said Friedman, who noted a case in which a lesbian couple used a sperm donor to get pregnant but didn’t have the procedure done under medical supervision.\n“When it’s done under medical supervision, everyone signs off. Everyone knows the game rules,” she said.\nIn this case, the sperm donor was not anonymous, and the biological mother was fighting to have him held legally recognised as a parent.\n“The kids know him as dad. The kids know they have three parents,” she said. “The courts don’t recognise three parents.”\nEven when there’s no conflict between the parties, complexities arise, such as in the case of a lesbian couple who had successful in vitro fertilisation and donated their extra embryos to another couple, who used the embryos to have a child.\nThe kids of both couples are genetically related to each other, but the second couple has no biological connection to their own child. The pair who donated the eggs was asked to sign off on the arrangement.\nThere was no disagreement in this case, but if there was, there’s no guarantee a judge would recognise the second couple’s status as legal parents.\n‘The Kids Are Alright’ explores what happens when a sperm donor becomes part of his children’s lives. Source: Supplied\nBIOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL\n“The law hasn’t kept up, because gay couples have children in different ways, it’s not the typical way it’s been done,” says matrimonial lawyer Eric Wrubel, who heads the New York State Bar Association’s LGBT Committee.\nThe standard of “what’s best for the child” is hard enough with two biological parents — it can be baffling with three or more adults involved.\n“In one family, you could have a child through an adoption, one child is through surrogacy and one child is through IVF. Like everybody else, sometimes it doesn’t work out. So then the question becomes: who has rights?” Wrubel notes.\nTraditionally, state law defines parenthood one of three ways: through a biological connection between adult and child; a legal adoption; or what’s known as the “presumption of legitimacy,” meaning a couple who has a child during marriage are presumed to be the parents.\nIt’s still unclear if the presumption of legitimacy will extend to married same-sex couples, says ACLU lawyer Leslie Cooper, who said despite marriage equality, laws about parentage vary from state to state.\n“We’re looking to get clarity through legislation, and in some places it’s going to happen through litigation, when couples split up and fight over custody,” she said.\nUntil that clarity, non-biological parents in same-sex unions are often left out in the cold if they don’t legally adopt their children, meaning they have no rights to custody, visitation or obligation to pay child support.\nProblems arise in same sex couples when one partner gives birth or donates sperm, creating a genetic link with a child, and the other partner doesn’t complete the legal formalities. It’s a scene often repeated with lesbian couples who have kids, lawyers say.\n“What if those two women break up? [The non-biological parent]’s got no right to see that child. She didn’t adopt, she doesn’t have standing to seek visitation, so she’s not the parent, even though she’s been parenting the child. She’s out,” said Bender.\nThe lawyer recalled one potential client, a woman whose same-sex relationship ended after a decade and one child together.\nThe woman “knew she did not have standing for visitation or custody, but she lived with this child for 10 years,” Bender said.\nLegally, the woman wasn’t required to financially support the kid, but “every single month this woman wrote a check. Every single month,” Bender said. “She was just doing the right thing.”\nAndrea Vacca, a longtime family lawyer who now works as a mediator, says disputes between biological and non-biological cases can get “to a terribly nasty place.”\n“When the relationship ends, the biological mother says, ‘You have no rights to this child,’ and she’s absolutely right, legally,” Vacca said.\nUpdating state law to define “de facto parents,” those who help raise kids even in absence of a biological connection or a legal adoption, would be a fix, Wrubel said.\nLegally defining the role of a non-biological parent would let that person “at least have a claim to assert a custodial right,” he said.\nA bill introduced to the New York Assembly in 2013 would do just that, but it has languished.\nPROBLEM WITH CHANGING THE LAW\nBut expanding the law to give “de facto” parents standing isn’t so simple, said family lawyer Michael David Meth, who said it’s important to have clear-cut standards.\n“If I make the choice to leave someone, and they haven’t ever taken the step to secure their parentage [through adoption], then they can’t come back after the fact,” he said.\nIf the same scenario played out with a heterosexual couple, in which one had kids but the other had no legal connection to the children, no one would blink an eye, Meth noted.\n“It has to be that way. Unless there’s abuse, neglect, abandonment; if none of those things exist in the genetic parent,” then there’s no standing, he said, adding, “If I have a girlfriend and we break up, she could file for custody of my kids?”\nJudges and lawyers are doing the best they can to handle changing times, Bender noted.\n“People’s lives are evolving, and the question becomes, how does the law actually step in and protect everybody? It’s challenging,” she said.\nAnd people might be more willing to compromise than be adversaries, said mediator Vacca.\n“People who are being very creative with how they bring children into the world are being creative when these relationships end,” she said. “They don’t want to hand it over to a judge.”\n“You’re always going to find cases that break the mould, that’s the nature of life,” said family lawyer Stephen Bilkis. “At the end of the day ... it’s all going to boil itself down to what’s in the best interest of the child.”\nThis article originally appeared on The New York Post .\nOriginally published as Inside a crazy custody battle: four parents, one child", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/inside-new-yorks-craziest-custody-case-four-parents-one-child/story-fnq2o7dd-1227506658271", "http://nypost.com/2015/08/30/inside-new-yorks-complicated-new-world-of-custody-cases/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/31/1227506/657638-e609d4e2-4f95-11e5-9956-40bbe7ca6ff2.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-01T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T11:53:27.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
