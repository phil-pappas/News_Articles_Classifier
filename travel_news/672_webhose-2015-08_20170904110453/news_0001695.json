Ranked among Australia’s great agricultural pioneers, Macarthur, along with his wife, Elizabeth, established merino wool production, wheat growing, dairying, horticulture and grape growing. Today, the ironbark stables, blacksmith shop, creamery, smokehouse and farm cottage remain, forming Australia’s most complete and authentic Georgian farm complex. It remains a working farm, as well as a tourist attraction where visitors can enjoy a glimpse into the past.\nOn Father’s Day, September 6, Belgenny Farm will offer a range of entertainment and activities for the whole family, including working dog shows, sheep shearing, live bands, tractor rides, pony rides, steam engines, snake and reptile shows, reptile displays, car displays, live music and novelty races for children – egg and spoon, tug-of-war and sack races. Those interested in the farm’s 210-year history can learn more through farm tours taking place throughout the day.\nSource:-Tourism Macarthur", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:26:24.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
