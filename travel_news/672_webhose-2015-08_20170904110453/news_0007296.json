For just a little while yet they won't be able to get on board even though trams will pull up at the stops.\n\"It is all part of the important step of making sure the full timetable across the whole network, including line one, is working just as we expect. We'll then get the green light and it's all systems go.\"\n– Councillor Nick McDonald at Nottingham City Council A new Southern Concourse linking passengers to Nottingham's expanding tram system has been built at the station. Credit: ITV News Central Current customers on Line One will still see trams displaying destinations of Toton Lane and Clifton South but this is just a test, and all trams will still end at Nottingham Station.\nMeanwhile, minor changes are being introduced to the current tram timetable on Line One as part of the final trials.\n\"Most existing customers will hardly notice any difference because trams will run just as frequently but for those passengers using our early morning and late evening services we've made some minor adjustments to departure times.\n\"The first tram from Hucknall will now be 6am instead of 6.05am and the first Phoenix Park service will now run 6 minutes earlier at 5.58am. There'll also be later trams from our new Nottingham Station stop to both Hucknall and Phoenix Park.\"\n– NET Marketing Manager, Jamie Swift The amended timetable will be in operation seven days a week from 31 July and full details will be published on tram stops and the brand new www.thetram.net website which is also launched today.\nLast updated Fri 31 Jul 2015 Travel Nottingham Nottinghamshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:41:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
