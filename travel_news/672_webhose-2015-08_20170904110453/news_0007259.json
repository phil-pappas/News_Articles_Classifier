The Barack Obama Foundation selected Chicago’s South Side as the home for Obama’s presidential library in the spring, and now the organization is set to begin the process of finding an architect. It’s still not yet clear if the library and accompanying facilities will be located at Washington Park or Jackson Park , the Chicago Sun-Times reported, but considering that the project will draw interest from many high-powered and prominent architects, the foundation plans to being the opening stages of its search “very soon.” The city of Chicago has cleared the way to transfer Park District land to the foundation, but the Sun-Times noted that the selection of architect will lead to a design, which in turn will likely determine where, precisely, the library will be built. The New York Times reported that search will begin this month . Furthermore, the paper reported on the shape of President Obama’s plans for after his term in office ends, and explained that his foundation is aiming to raise at least $800 million for the facility, a large enough sum that it could allow him to avoid pitfalls that befell former President Bill Clinton as he attempted to launch his presidential library and found that he was short of the funds needed to accomplish his goals. Some of those goals are continuations of the president’s agenda while in office -- improving health care, battling climate change, and addressing economic inequality, among others -- but the Times said it’s gradually becoming clear that technology will be at the core of Obama’s work. That is, he will seek to employ the latest technologies to advance his preferred narratives, the Times said. \nWant Chicago Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
