Daily Telegraph 13 Jul 2015 News Reason to visit ... Americans played “tourist” in Tourism Australia’s indigenous tourism campaign called “Our Country is waiting for you”.

Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nMelbourne also experienced strong growth, with visitors growing 38.8 per cent, and tropical north Queensland attracted more US tourists than Brisbane (89,256 compared with 72,821). \nHeading in the other direction, 976,900 Australians travelled to the US in the year to June 30, up four per cent on the previous year. \nMr James said it wasn’t surprising the weaker dollar had not proved much of a deterrent to overseas travel. \n“Aussies have seen wealth gains in the past 12 months,” he said. \n“There’s still a modest degree of wage growth, and the job market hasn’t deteriorated that much over the last 12 months, and that’s provided a degree of confidence.” \nAn analysis undertaken by Expedia.com.au found New Zealand currently represented the best value for Aussie holiday-makers, and was the only country where our dollar bought more than it did a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:28:47.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
