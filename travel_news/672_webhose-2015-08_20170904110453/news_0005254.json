Other catering beauties and 'hunks' from Taiwan have included fruit, tofu, and cake vendors in capital Taipei, as well as a butcher who became affectionately known as the 'Pork Princess'. \nDespite her surge in popularity some readers have accused the blogger of manipulating the pictures, with some claiming the woman does not exist at all. \nHowever, her Instagram account suggests otherwise with her selfies earning her a loyal fan base of 29,000 followers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:54:24.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
