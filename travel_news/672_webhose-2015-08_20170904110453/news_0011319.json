In addition to this, the new Hosted Buyers attending the show represent 52 countries across the globe. \nRob Davidson, Managing Director, MICE Knowledge comments, “The rise in interest from Hosted Buyers reflects the growing optimism surrounding the global economy, as shown in the latest quarterly poll of senior managers carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit. That survey showed that the balance of respondents who think business conditions are set to improve over the next six months has risen to 22 percentage points, up six from the previous quarter.” \nGraeme Barnett, ibtm world, Senior Exhibition Director commented, “With three months left until the show and Hosted Buyer applications up 38% on last year, this is a great result. We can also confirm that 72% of the new Hosted Buyers signed up to attend organise more than 5 international events per year providing a great business platform for MICE suppliers from across the globe to come together and showcase themselves to this powerful audience of buyers.” \nAccepted Hosted Buyer applications of corporate meeting planners who will attend for the first time have average meetings budgets of $10.1 million each and include major companies such as Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Microsoft, Britvic Soft Drinks, Peugeot Citroen, GlaxoSmithKline, Fossil, Merck, Lamprel and Unilever. \nDanielle Robbins, Deutsche Bank AG, CB&S, who will attend ibtm world 2015 as a Hosted Buyer comments, “Attending ibtm world is extremely important for my business as it allows me to source suppliers and venues that are reliable, unusual and professional. I’m hoping to make contacts that I can use to arrange conferences abroad as well as at home. I also find that having a personal experience prior to booking a service or venue is important, I feel much more confident recommending something if I have seen it, experienced it or have a relationship with the supplier.” \nThe My Association | My Club program will welcome new Hosted Buyers from major associations and association management companies including Society of Nephrology (ISN), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP), Wheeling Around the World (WAW) and The Association Specialists and American Urological Association. \nJo Lieberman, Hosted Buyer Manager, ibtm world comments, “This year we have a really impressive lineup of Association Hosted Buyers confirmed to attend with over 62% of new buyers representing associations of over 1,000 members. Further to this, the average annual meetings budget of each of new buyer is $6.3 million. \nHosted Buyer applications are reviewed and accepted based on the number and size of meetings, events, incentives and conferences they purchase annually, individual purchasing authority, their annual budget for meetings, events and incentives, the value of their recent business booked and potential for future business in the meetings and business travel industries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:46:59.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
