Send us your travel tips for the chance to win a £350 holiday voucher Lake Balaton was a stand-out selection of our readers' favourite lakes Photo: Fotolia/AP 5:55PM BST 07 Aug 2015 This week’s winning letter Lake Balaton, Hungary \nThe Russians have discovered it, the Germans have frequented it for years, but why is Lake Balaton in Hungary still relatively undiscovered by British tourists? \nFor me it is a mystery, as I have enjoyed the area for a long time. I’ve cycled around it, sampled the excellent riesling wine from Badacsony on the northern shore, taken a steam boat on it, caught the train alongside it, swam in it, had dental treatment at Heviz close by and eaten at superb fish restaurants beside it. You can also sail on it or take a balloon ride over it. \nJust a couple of hours from Budapest, Lake Balaton is in a peaceful, safe area, with beautiful scenery and accommodation options at a multitude of lakeside towns that are many, varied and represent great value. \nI guess it can be described as delightfully dated, but take that as a compliment not a criticism. \nChris Westcott, from East Sussex, wins a £350 travel voucher with DialAFlight Lock Coruisk, Skye \nViews of the Black Cuillin mountains Photo: Fotolia/AP \nSurely there cannot be a more magnificent view than the Black Cuillin mountains seen from Elgol on the Inner Hebridean island of Skye? But take a small boat from Elgol, as Bonnie Prince Charlie did 270 years ago when fleeing the English, and ask to be dropped off on the shore of Loch Scavaig. From here a short walk leads to that most magnificently situated of all Scottish lochs, Loch Coruisk. It is dominated and encircled on three sides by the main Cuillin Ridge, a knife-edged horseshoe of more than 20 sheer alpine-like peaks rarely dropping below 3,000ft and stretching nearly eight miles from end to end. Ask the boatman to pick you up four hours later, giving you ample time to walk around the loch and savour this remote and isolated hidden gem. \nRowland Little, Kent Lake Kivu, Rwanda \nOn Rwanda’s western border lies this jewel. No crocs or hippos lurk in its diamond-clear waters and in places its rocky shores give way improbably to golden sandy beaches. Its waters are irresistible for swimming and its slightly acidic content makes you as buoyant as in the sea. \nIn many places, life on the lake continues as it has always done; dugout canoes skim arrow-like across the bays, laden with freshly caught tilapia, vegetables, fruit and livestock for market. At the end of the dry season when storms crackle theatrically around the lake and drench the parched hills with rain, you can see majestically horned cattle, swimming across from islands back to the mainland to catch the new grass which springs up green and luscious apparently overnight. \nLake Kivu Photo: Fotolia/AP \nKivu is accessible from the capital, Kigali, and waiting to be discovered. \nCarol Brookshaw, Worcestershire Saint Mary Lake, United States \nThis gem, within the Glacier National Park, Montana, is my favourite lake. The majestic Cascades Mountains sit above the lake on the southern side and as you drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road towards the park summit of Logan Pass (used by Stanley Kubrick for his opening sequence in The Shining), the view is stunning and creates a sense of awe at the sheer beauty of nature at its best. Take the trail around the western end to St Mary Falls and Virginia Falls to encounter the local wildlife. \nDavid Chapman, Wigan Bala Lake, Wales \nBala Lake, Wales Photo: Alamy \nMagnificent Bala Lake, Llyn Tegid in Welsh, is the largest natural body of water in Wales. It is 150ft deep and four miles long, and popular for watersports, fishing and great camping. The River Dee (Afon Dyfrdwy) enters its clear waters at the south-west of the lake, at Llanuwchllyn, exiting close to Bala. \nLlyn Tegid translates as “The Lake of Serenity”, a fitting title considering its tranquil ambience and breathtaking surroundings. Steeped in legend, the lake is said to be home to a monster known affectionately as “Teggie”. It is also claimed that on moonlit nights the towers and buildings of a sunken village are visible through the water. \nColin Piers, Buckinghamshire Medicine Lake, Canada \nIn Jasper National Park, a road climbs to Maligne Lake with its iconic Spirit Island, but on the way you can find serene Medicine Lake and park your car where the outflow disappears underground. Mountains with dense forested slopes are mirrored in the water. Aspens along the shore turn gold in the autumn. I have seen black bears there with cubs, and bighorn sheep on the steep banks. This year a bald eagle nested at the top of a spruce tree. Wild flowers grow in profusion among the rocks. But in July a wildfire broke out near Medicine Lake. I saw the flames engulf the trees as we were evacuated. Later, photographs showed the lake reflecting blackened mountainsides. And what has happened to the bear cubs and the bald eagle chick? Will my beautiful Medicine Lake ever be the same? \nMargaret Inkpen, Lincolnshire Lake Ziway, Ethiopia \nLake Ziway, Ethiopia Photo: Alamy \nTo reach our boat, moored beside Lake Ziway in Ethiopia, we walked alongside a narrow estuary where we marvelled at the pelicans, storks, flamingos, ibis, avocets, egrets, herons, marabou, kingfishers and many others. We set off for the island, Debre Sina, followed by flocks of birds swooping to catch the small fry disturbed by the outboard. We were thrilled to see the occasional pair of eyes, ears and snouts of hippopotamus gracefully rising to the surface then sinking back into the muddy depths. \nOn the island we walked through woods, passing birds and wild goats, to the peak where a small circular church nestled alongside a wooden house and outbuildings, the dwellings for the priest and his family, the sole human residents on the island. Rows of small fish were pegged to a line, strung between two trees, to dry. \nIan Hanlon, Northamptonshire Ho Hoan Lien, Vietnam \nHo Hoan Kien, the “Green Lake”, lies physically and emotionally in the centre of the lovely city of Hanoi. It provides tranquillity on the edge of the bustling Old Quarter made up of 36 streets each devoted to a particular product – for example, the bamboo basket-makers of Hang Bo. Along these narrow streets crowded with motorcycles, bikes and pedestrians, there is a frenzy of activity before they merge into the wide avenues circling the lake. There is activity on the side of the lake all day, starting with the morning fitness enthusiasts and then the tourists making their way along the red, ornate Rising Sun Bridge to the Temple of Jade Mountain. \nTim Lowe, Stockport Lough Erne, Northern Ireland \nLouge Erne Photo: Alamy \nThis lake, in Co Fermanagh, casts a spell over any visitor. Stand on the hill in front of Oscar Wilde and Samuel Beckett’s old school, Portora, and you can see the waterscape which inspired their genius. Be captivated by the upper and lower lakes, connected yet so different, the broad open lough then hundreds of picturesque islands. Cruiser hire brings many delights, stopping in villages or picnicking on an island. At sunset, look west from the Knockninny bay, towards the Cuilcagh mountain and down the green valley to the lakeshore and see a land of fairy tales beneath “Speaking Horse Peak”. \nIan Elliott, Belfast \nEach week we offer a prize to whoever sends us the best travel tip.
