The Santiago-based company formerly known as LAN Airlines merged three years ago with Brazil's TAM. However, it has struggled to live up to the promise of its 2012 tie-up. In its last quarter in May, it reported a net loss.\nWith Brazil facing a protracted downturn and a strong depreciation of its currency, the outlook is unlikely to improve in the short-term, acknowledged LAN President Ignacio Cueto.\n\"We would like to have much better results. For now, that won't happen. We are very linked to the Brazilian economy and as that economy recovers, we will recover too,\" he said.\nForeign exchange weakness had been partly compensated for by a strong fall in the oil price, he said.\n\"The effect (of the fall) would have been much greater if there hadn't been such strong devaluations in Colombia, Brazil and Chile,\" he said.\nThe move to create a unified, global brand instead of two strong domestic brands underscores a growing industry focus on international tourism to offset softer domestic demand in the region.\nThe unified brand, LATAM, will be visible on planes and other areas from next year, with the whole process taking around three years to complete, LATAM said.\nThe company also has LAN subsidiaries in Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador, which will be folded into the LATAM brand. The group is due to report first half results next week.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:02:55.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
