Throughout history artists have collected objects for many reasons â€“ as studio props, sources of inspiration, references for their work,personal mementos and as investment.\nUnlike museums, artists do not always take a scholarly approach to collecting, nor do they seek to assemble comprehensive and representative collections. Reflecting personal interests and obsessions, their acquisitions are usually made in tandem with their own work and often for aesthetic reasons.Magnificent Obsessions: The Artist as Collector presents a selection of objects from the collections of the artists alongside a key example of their work to provide insight into their inspirations, influences, motives and obsessions.\nTheir collections range from mass-produced memorabilia to rare art and artefacts and from natural history specimens to curios and objects reflecting popular culture. These extraordinary collections help reveal the creative processes of some of the most important artists of the last 50 years.\nSource:-Sainsbury Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:48:55.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
