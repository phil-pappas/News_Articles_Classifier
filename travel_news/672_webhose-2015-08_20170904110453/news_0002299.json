Lion \nThe airlines have announced that they will no longer carry lion, rhinoceros, leopard, elephant or buffalo remains, although they have not given official reasons for their announcements, the BBC said. \nDelta flies to a number of African cities, and became the subject of an online petition in a bid to ban shipments of such trophies. \nAmerican Airlines, which flies to only eight sub-Saharan cities, said in a tweet that its decision to stop carrying trophies was “effective immediately”. \nIt follows the shooting of Cecil last month, who was killed illegally by hunter Walter Palmer, from Minnesota. \nZimbabwe is now seeking his extradition, as well as that of a doctor from Pennsylvania, who is suspected of killing a lion in April. \nPalmer is thought to have paid around £32,000 to hunt Cecil, who had been a major tourist attraction in the Hwange National Park. \nHe has insisted he believed the hunt was legal and was unaware that Cecil was protected. \nMeanwhile Botswana announced last week that sports hunters would no longer be welcome in its country following the death of Cecil. \nGovernment spokesperson Jeff Ramsay reportedly stated that sports hunting had been banned in Botswana. Last year the country also moved to ensure that its lions and other large carnivores were not exported to South Africa or any other country for hunting purposes. \n“We commend the concerned authorities for acting swiftly and arresting the culprits,” Ramsay said in a statement. “We remain hopeful that they will all be prosecuted for carrying out this unjustified act. \n“It is our stern belief that safari hunting of threatened species such as lions has the potential to undermine our regional anti-poaching efforts as it encourages illegal trade which in turn promotes poaching. \n“To this end, individuals partaking in such sport hunting expeditions will not be welcome in Botswana.” \nHe added: “Last year we also moved to close any loopholes in the export of our lions etc for canned hunting in your country (South Africa) or elsewhere.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:15:32.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
