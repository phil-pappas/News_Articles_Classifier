It was potentially a solid value, but the offer expired on June 30. That offer is being reprised, with a twist. \nOffer Details \nThrough August 31, IHG Rewards members can earn a bonus of up to 100 percent when purchasing Rewards points, effectively reducing the price to as little as .58 cents per point. \nThe \"up to\" qualifier is key here: Depending on a member's stay history and other variables known only to IHG's marketing brain trust, the bonus could be 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent, or 100 percent. A member's personalized bonus will only be revealed when he signs into the buy-points landing page with his IHG Rewards credentials. (Mine was only 50 percent.) \nThe normal pricing is as follows, with a maximum purchase of 60,000 points per year: 1,000 - 10,000 points for $13.50 per 1,000 points 11,000 - 25,000 points for $12.50 per 1,000 points 26,000 - 60,000 points for $11.50 per 1,000 points \nWith a 100 percent bonus, the number of points is doubled at each price point, for an annual maximum of 120,000 points. \nDeal or No Deal \nAt the normal price, IHG Rewards points cost between 1.2 and 1.4 cents apiece. With the bonus, the price drops to as little as little as 0.58 cents per point. \nTo put that into perspective, the 100 percent bonus allows the purchase of 100,000 points for $575. That's enough for 10 nights at the cheapest hotels in the IHG network, which require 10,000 points per night. \nAt the luxury end of the spectrum, two nights at the InterContinental Paris, off the Champs Elysees, can be booked for 100,000 points, or for EUR 710 ($775 at today's exchange rate). So, with the 100 percent points bonus, you'd be buying the $775 two-night stay for $575. \nWith hotel programs constantly devaluing their points, it's risky to purchase points as a long-term investment. But if you can use them sooner rather than later, these discounted points have the potential to deliver great value, especially if you're offered one of the higher-level bonuses. \nReader Reality Check \nWhich bonus were you offered? \nYou Might Also Like:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:32:09.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
