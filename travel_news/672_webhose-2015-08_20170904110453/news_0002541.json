Trump's organization was selected by the federal government to renovate the historic Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue and turn it into a luxury hotel.\nAndres announced last month that he was cancelling plans to open the restaurant, citing what he called Trump's disparaging comments about Mexican immigrants. Andres is an immigrant from Spain.\nThe lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Washington says Andres' decision has already cost Trump's organization millions of dollars. It says Andres signed a lease that obligated him to build a restaurant in the space and pay rent for 10 years.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:04:16.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
