But we now need to ask ourselves: does Australia have what it takes to compete in a world where most leading economies are increasingly knowledge intensive?\nFor a country to be successful in growing its knowledge economy, it needs to first identify which industries are future-proof and then support students and companies in these sectors who can turn skills into products and services. There should be seamless integration between innovation, business and education but we are a long way from that model.\nMany Western countries are investing in their knowledge and resource base and Australia needs to do the same.Conferences and professional meetings are vital to any country seeking to develop a knowledge economy. Business events drive trade, industry, investment, high-yield tourism and global talent acquisition.\nHighly productive knowledge economies are those that manage to collaborate with others, not only within their own country but internationally. Business events are where people meet to exchange ideas and reveal innovations and it is often where networks and collaborations begin. These events are extremely valuable for those taking part and for their institutions and countries.\nSource:-BESydney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:24:08.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
