Few business travelers use Uber \nAlthough ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft continue to expand across the country, the services remain one of the least popular ground transportation options among business travelers. \nWhen business travelers need a ride, 36% rent a car, 24% hail a taxi and 13% call for a chauffeur, with only 11% relying on a ride-sharing service, according to a new study by the educational arm of the Global Business Travel Association. \nOne reason ride-sharing companies have yet to overtake taxis and rental car companies in popularity among business travelers is that 24% of travel managers say their companies do not allow their business travelers to use ride-sharing services, according to the GBTA study. \n—Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:15:44.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
