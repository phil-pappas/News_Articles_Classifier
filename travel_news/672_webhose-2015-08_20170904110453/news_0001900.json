This is an exciting and important step for Air Seychelles,\" Minister Morgan said. \nMr. Kinnear said: \"Air Seychelles has grown its network and passenger numbers strongly over the past three years. With a more complex business and more airline partners, the timing is right to introduce a technology solution which is focused on enhancing the guest experience. \n\"This is the next step in facilitating the continued and planned expansion of the business. \n\"SabreSonic first and foremost means happier guests. When implemented, SabreSonic will provide our team with more complete information on our guests' bookings at each touch point in their journey. Simpler processes will also mean our team will have more time to provide the support our guests expect. \n\"Guests will also have more control and flexibility as it will be possible to book tickets for travel on Air Seychelles and manage itineraries on a smartphone, as well as check-in online for both domestic and international flights. \n\"This proven technology is also good for the financial success of the business, because with the tools made available we will be able to grow revenue in an innovative, sustainable and customer-focused way. \n\"SabreSonic is being used by many of our codeshare partners, including Etihad Airways and Jet Airways, with Alitalia and airberlin also migrating to the platform. Having a common platform will enhance customer service for guests traveling with multiple airlines in the Etihad Airways Partners group,\" Mr. Kinnear said. \nShane Batt said: \"Air Seychelles is entering an exciting period of expansion and we are proud to be selected as the technology partner that will help enable this. Sabre's deep experience across the global aviation sector will ensure that, in partnership with Air Seychelles, it implements technology solutions that enable the airline to meet its commercial, customer service and business performance objectives. We will work closely with Air Seychelles in the coming years to support its business and unlock innovation opportunities, leveraging the latest data, mobile and personalization trends. \n\"Under the project our business consultants will work side by side with the Air Seychelles team, transferring knowledge and skill to ensure a smooth implementation of the new systems with maximum benefit to the airline and its guests.\" \nSabre's technology is favored by 225 airlines worldwide including most of the world's largest carriers. Its flexible and scalable software allows airlines to operate how they want to, and adapt their business to changing needs and requirements. It optimizes day-to-day airline operations and ultimately helps airlines solve their biggest challenges â€“ to increase revenues, reduce costs and deliver better travel experiences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T22:54:27.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
