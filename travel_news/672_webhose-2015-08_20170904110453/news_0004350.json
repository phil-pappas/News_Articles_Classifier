OneJet will begin to announce new destinations from its current focus city of Indianapolis beginning August 12th (from which it currently serves Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, and Memphis) and plans to confirm the selection of its second focus city on or before September 15th. \nOneJet's expansion schedule will add approximately one aircraft per month and up to 12 additional destinations and/or focus cities through 2016. \nFormer U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation, John Porcari, a senior advisor to the OneJet Program, stated: \"Today's announcement follows a highly focused product and operational pilot period within OneJet's initial network. We've been thrilled by our customer's response to the service and look forward to expanding this service to additional travelers and communities.\" \nMatthew Maguire, OneJet Chief Executive Officer, continued: \"To-date, OneJet has surpassed its 1000th passenger carried, serving the frequent business traveler as well as becoming a preferred vendor to numerous Fortune 500 companies. As we allocate additional capacity to our focus cities over the course of this coming year, and from those points to an increasing number of destinations, OneJet will continue to expand its network to deliver nonstop service in regional air markets across the country.\" \nOneJet service offers travelers an expedited, convenient, and highly personalized service experience, while simultaneously delivering the highest levels of safety, security, and comfort. OneJet flights are easily accessible through existing travel agency points of sale and provide amenities including access to TSA Pre security screening for eligible Known Travelers, an expedited boarding process, and complimentary on board amenities. \nSenior advisor Jack Pelton, former CEO of Cessna Aircraft Company, added, \"OneJet's platform represents a new form of distribution and optimization for our nation's air transportation capacity, creating new opportunities for both U.S. travelers and suppliers, particularly in markets which have faced increasing pressure as a result of network carrier consolidation. As such markets see declines in the number of flights offered by network carriers, consumers and companies are realizing that OneJet is an effective, accessible solution that creates tremendous time savings and convenience for regional travel.\" \nOneJet will shortly announce the appointment of several additional team members, in preparation for its next phase of growth. These appointments will complement OneJet's existing base of distribution, revenue optimization, and operational expertise, with a current team that includes, among others, Dr. Barry Smith, former Chief Scientist of Sabre, Fred Reid, Virgin America founding CEO and former President of Delta, and Terry Jones, Travelocity founder and former Chairman of Kayak.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:22:51.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
