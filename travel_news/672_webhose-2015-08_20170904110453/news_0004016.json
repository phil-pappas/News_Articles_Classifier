The promotion was launched today on the airline's social media channels and simply transfers the concept of hitchhiking to air travel. To participate, all potential hitchhikers need is free time, a sense of adventure, a hitchhiking sign with their desired destination, a backpack or travel bag and a little luck that the \"airtramp\" bus stops for them on 14 August. \nThe bus will leave Hermannplatz at 1 pm before picking up 50 hitchhikers along a pre-determined route through the city and bringing them directly to their airberlin flight at the airport. YouTube star Sarazar and Instagram star Berlinstagram will also be reporting live on board the bus. The hitchhikers will be able to choose from five international destinations from the airberlin route network for their spontaneous trip: Copenhagen, Rome, Vienna, Abu Dhabi and New York. The return flight is included in the promotion. \n\"The target group of the Trampflug promotion is mainly airberlin's more flexible travellers, who have the time and inclination for spontaneous events. We hope that as many Berliners as possible will take part. With this promotion, we are the first German airline to start communicating with Snapchat, and we will continue to use this new social media channel for more promotions and events in future. It's definitely worth keeping an eye on Snapchat as well as airberlin's other channels, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram,\" said Andr√© Rahn, Senior Vice President Marketing airberlin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:52:30.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
