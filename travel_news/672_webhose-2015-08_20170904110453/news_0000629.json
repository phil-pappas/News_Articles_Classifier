On Sunday, Taugner was part of a group of Six Flags employees who became the last-ever official riders on Roar. \nTaugner, now a carpenter for the ride, looks at the wooden structure and sees not just fun but his work. \n\"This last ride was even a bit better (than his first one) because I've put so much sweat and effort into it in the past year,\" said Taugner, who estimates he's ridden Roar about 180 times in the past year alone for maintenance checks -- always in the last car in seat No. 23. \nSix Flags Discovery KingdomPark President Don McCoy called the closure of Roar, the Vallejo park's sole wooden roller-coaster, a bittersweet moment for the ride which has seen more than 11 million riders since its opening in 1999. While something new and innovative is projected for the park in place of Roar, he noted that after the July 16 announcement of the ride's closure, the park needed some kind of commemoration of the ride. With that in mind, special commemorative T-shirts were made for park employees noting the lifespan of Roar and a public celebration planned. Advertisement \nSunday's celebration of the ride included special prize giveaways (like pieces of the Roar track), DJ music, commemorative T-shirts for the public and special behind-the-scenes tours. Additionally, according to a press release, members of the public with special memories were invited to the park, such a couple that was married on Roar in 1999. \nNancy Chan, the park's communication manager, noted that one wooden roller-coaster enthusiast drove all the way from New Orleans just to ride Roar. Arriving on Thursday, he had ridden the coaster 31 times as of his last ride on Sunday, which was the third-to-last trip for Roar. \nJustin Griffin of Hercules, 36, was in the front row on the last ride for the public on Sunday, and estimates he's ridden Roar almost 500 times, riding for the first time when he was 23. When it was first constructed, Roar was the tallest and fastest wooden roller-coaster on the West Coast, according to park publicity information. \nOn Sunday, Griffin said \"it was as smooth as when it first opened.' \nCarpenter Josh Taugner would agree. After his ride on Sunday, he summed up his memories by stating, \"It's had its rough times, but it's always been a blast. I've had nice moments every day I've ridden it.\" \nAnd now, Roar goes quiet. -", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:24:20.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
