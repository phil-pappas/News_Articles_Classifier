Young people go to those places a lot, and they might have some crisps, a sandwich or a toasted sandwich; you’re in the middle of the hills and these are places for locals. If you were staying in one of the bigger cities, you might have arancini [fried rice balls], salami or olives. \nBar Enzo di Marzani Luigi, Via A Moro 1, Bardi (0039 0525 72377). \nCaffe Centrale, Via P Cella 45, Bardi (0039 0525 71621; caffecentralebardi.it ). Drink €3.50 at both, maybe €4 with a snack. Dinner \nIn Modena there are little streets that are really romantic at night, and Hosteria Giusti is on one of them. Run for years by a father, mother, son and daughter team, it’s an old butcher’s shop with a lovely salumeria [charcuterie shop] at the front. The restaurant at the back is where they once killed the beef, so they have these gulleys where the blood used to run. Across the alleyway is an amazing wine cellar. \nI first went there more than 15 years ago. There was no menu and they cooked for you whatever they had. Now it’s a lot more famous and they do have a menu: things fried bread with “lardo” [white, cured pork fat], fried cotechino sausage, beef cheek, and pork fillet cooked with onions and balsamic vinegar. The father died two years ago but the mum has been in the kitchen all her life and does this amazing saltcod brandade. I took four of my chefs there, and the next week they were all trying to get it as good as hers. None of them did. \n• Gourmet Italy: what to eat and drink in Puglia \nModena Photo: AP/FOTOLIA \nFor pizza I’d recommend La Barraca, just outside Bardi – a 10-minute drive. It’s right on the Ceno river that runs through the region, a tributary of the Taro River, so it’s atmospheric at night. It’s quirky, and you can sit outside under these vines. I’d have a pizza margherita or one made with prosciutto cotto [cooked ham], funghi [wild mushrooms] and black olives. Simple but perfect. \nHosteria Giusti, Vicolo Squallore 46, Modena (0039 059 222 533; hosteriagiusti.it ). Three courses €40-€60, without drinks \nRistorante Pizzeria La Baracca, Localita Ponte Al Ceno 208, Bardi (0039 0525 71149; ristorantelabaracca.com ). Pizza €8-€12.
