It is an important region that we are not currently represented in as Norwegian Cruise Line.” \n\nNCL remained coy when asked whether they would be placing any of their new ships – which are due in 2018 and 2019 – into the region, with Stuart saying, “we wouldn’t rule it out”. \n\nHe also admitted that NCL will have to customise any ship being placed in Asia to better suit the Asian market. “No decisions have been made yet,” he said. \n\nAdditional reporting by TTG Digital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:37:17.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
