Before you take the leap and leave the country you need to have a strong retirement fund behind you that can cope with the extra expenses with which you may be faced and also with the vagaries of currency movements that could affect your funds buying power in your new home. John Hayward, an independent financial adviser from Spectrum IFA, which specialises in helping expats abroad, says that many retirees remain “surprisingly unprepared” for their new life, and are easily caught out. “Lots of financial products that are tax-free in the UK are not so when you move abroad,” he said. “You need to be very sure of the rules.” Here are some of the most important points to consider. Can I afford to retire abroad? Most retirees, whether at home or abroad, will have two main sources of income – their private and their state pensions. They may also have rental income from a UK property, and income from investments and savings. The first step for those who plan to retire abroad is to look at what you will have to live on. You can get a state pension forecast here , and if you write to the trustees of your private pension scheme you should be able to get details of what those pensions are worth. You can claim your state pension if you live abroad, but Pension Credit - a benefit that tops up your weekly income - stops when you move overseas permanently. If you live in the UK the state pension increases each year, but this is not always the case if you live outside the UK. You can check the countries in which your pension will increase here . After the wide-ranging changes to pension rules that came in on 6 April 2015 , you no longer need to buy an annuity to give you a lifetime income with your pension. Instead, you can take it all as cash, or take it in chunks as and when you need it. Whatever you decide, you can take a quarter of it as tax-free cash. You should also look at income from other investments, and decide what you would do with your current property if you have one, and if that would help you to reach your goal at retirement. When you move abroad you must tell HMRC and the International Pension Centre, to ensure that you pay the right amount of tax and receive the pension due to you. What are my savings options? It pays to make these calculations well ahead of retirement, so that you can take steps to grow your pension pot and other resources if you are worried that you won’t have enough. A diversified portfolio of investments within tax-efficient wrappers including private pensions such as SIPPs and ISAs is one of the best ways to ensure your money grows in order to give you the income you need. Once you become a resident abroad, you may find that your ISAs do not keep their tax-free status, but it pays to make the most of them before you go. You can put £15,240 into an Isa in 2015/16, so couples can save more than £30,000 between them, if they each have an ISA and use their full allowance, meaning that you can shelter a large amount of money from tax. Both ISAs and SIPPs allow you a large measure of control over your finances, as you can use them to save in investments or in cash. It is worth noting that if you are planning to save over a longer period, investments nearly always outperform cash savings. How can I make my savings grow faster? If you are working in the UK and paying UK taxes, saving into a pension will give you valuable tax breaks. At present for everyone except the highest earners, the Annual Allowance, or amount that you are allowed to put into a pension each year and receive tax relief, remains at £40,000. Basic rate tax is automatically added to your pension. For high earners however, from April 2016, the annual pension allowance will be cut by £1 for each £2 earned over £150,000. It will taper down from £40,000 until it hits the new £10,000 personal allowance level for higher earners. This means that, if you earn over £150,000, you will only effectively be receiving tax relief on the first £10,000 of contributions to your pension in each financial year. Because of this, it may be more tax-efficient to use an ISA or other savings vehicle to prepare for retirement. To claim back the higher rate tax you paid, you need to do this through your UK tax return. If you are unsure about whether you will be affected by this change, or whether it is best to save money in an ISA or a pension, an independent financial adviser may be able to help you. What currency considerations should I be aware of? For many expat pensioners, one of the most difficult things to plan for financially has been the fluctuation of their local currency against the pound - especially in recent years. This is something you need to take into account when growing your savings pot for your retirement. It might sound obvious, but as a pensioner, your income is in pounds, but if you live abroad your expenditure will be in the local currency. Research from currency specialist HIFX shows that British pensioners living overseas have potentially lost out on more than £10.6bn of their income since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, due to the weakening of sterling. A currency broker will be able to advise you on how you can fix currency rates at which your income is converted into a foreign currency for six months or a year, or to take advantage of times when sterling is strong. What are the tax implications of retiring abroad? Once you have looked at what you have, you need to consider the tax implications of retiring abroad, which may be different to those if you retire in the UK. Essentially, if you move abroad you are taxed there – though if you have assets remaining in the UK those may still also be liable for UK tax. You will have to tell the tax authorities in the area to which you move about all of your income, but because of structures called “double taxation agreements” with most popular retirement destinations, you shouldn’t end up paying tax on your income twice. Be aware that you may not be able to use tax-efficient structures such as ISAs if you are moving abroad. There is further information on tax when retiring abroad here. To get help with ensuring your hard-earned savings continue to work for you when you are abroad, it may be worth speaking to a specialist adviser who can advise on issues such as transferring your private pension to a Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS). If you have assets in the UK, you will also need to consider inheritance tax implications. In some cases, you may need two wills – one dealing with your UK assets and another with assets overseas. As always, if you aren’t confident going it alone, consult a professional. Whether you’re looking to retire soon or in the future, they can help you plan for every stage, so you can focus on relaxing and exploring your new home.
