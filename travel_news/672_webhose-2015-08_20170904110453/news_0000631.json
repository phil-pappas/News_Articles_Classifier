Related Content Top 10 U.S. beaches of 2015 \nIt's a tidy two-bedroom apartment in a neighborhood overlooking some of Rio de Janeiro's most stunning beaches. \nOn the other hand, the hillside community called Cantagalo -- or \"Rooster's Crow\" -- with its stacks of brick and cement homes was dominated by violent drug gangs until just a couple of years ago. \nIn fact, for decades foreigners and Brazilians alike steered clear of Rio's so-called favelas. \nThat has begun to change. \n\"My boyfriend had the idea of renting my apartment, but I wasn't convinced,\" she says. \n\"I thought who's going to come to a favela? But it was nonsense! Tons of foreigners love to stay here.\" \nIn 2008, police and soldiers were sent into dozens of favelas to seize control from drug gangs and set up a permanent security presence. \nThey now have Police Pacification Units in 38 of more than 1,000 Rio favelas. \n\"I rent to a lot of foreigners now,\" she says, showing us around the modest third-story apartment which goes for 150 reais, or less than $50 a day, and comes with Internet and an electrical fan to cool off. \n\"I've had people from France, from New York, from England,\" she says. \nGoncalves uses the money to pay for university classes. \n\"Right now it's peaceful\" \nSecurity is still an issue. \nAlthough 2015 has been relatively peaceful, last year there was a string of shootouts between rival gangs and police that rattled residents in Cantagalo and raised questions about the effectiveness of the police \"pacification\" drive. \n\"I've never had any problems here,\" Goncalves says. \n\"It could be that at some point something happens, but you never know. Favelas are unstable. Right now it's peaceful.\" \nCritics say the police campaign will never truly be successful without better police training to improve relations with residents and more state services to provide education and job opportunities in the communities. \nMany residents complain that while security has brought tourists, it has also sparked a huge increase in real estate prices. \nThe most popular favela by far among tourists is Vidigal, a picturesque community perched on a steep hill overlooking Rio's exclusive Ipanema and Leblon beaches. \nIt has traditional hostels like the Hostel Alto Vidigal, which is covered in colorful murals. \nA bed in a shared room starts at 21 reais, or $6 a night. \n\"The Olympics are still a year away, but we're completely full, with a waiting list,\" says manager Vicente Favorito. \nFamily tours and luxury suites \nVisitors are generally looking for a more authentic experience, and of course the cheap prices and great views. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T05:00:10.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
