The city's tourism industry has made a stunning comeback with new and revitalized hotels, an exploding restaurant scene and new attractions like Crescent Park and the Lafitte Greenway.\nBut many visitors to New Orleans also like to plan day trips outside the city to sample nearby scenery and culture. Some attractions, including swamp tours and plantation tours, offer pick up at New Orleans hotels in vans so you don't even have to rent a car.\nOptions for day trips include the Jean Lafitte Swamp Tour, which takes visitors into the bayou for a boat ride to see the scenery and wildlife; Grand Isle for fishing and birding, and gator ranches, like the Greenwood Gator Farm near Houma in Terrebonne Parish and the Insta-Gator Ranch in St. Tammany Parish.\nJean Laffite National Historical Park and Preserve has six visitor centres including Chalmette Battlefield in St. Bernard Parish, which tells the story of the Battle of New Orleans and the War of 1812. You can even take a boat from New Orleans across the river to the battlefield.\nFor Cajun culture, there's the Wetlands Acadian Cultural Center in Lafourche Parish, which offers Monday night Cajun music jam sessions; the food and music scene in Vermilion Parish, about a two-hour drive from New Orleans, and of course the city of Lafayette, a capital of all things Cajun.\nSt. Tammany Parish has several destinations for day-trippers including Slidell's historic downtown, the restaurant scene in Covington and a brewery tour in Abita Springs.\nOther notable tours outside New Orleans take place at the Donner-Peltier Distillery in Thibodaux, in Lafourche Parish, built on an old sugar plantation, where the rum is named Rougaroux after a mythical werewolf-like creature, and the tabasco factory tour on Avery Island in Iberia Parish. Soon to open on Avery Island: a new visitor centre and restaurant.\nRiver Road, which runs 70 miles along the Mississippi River and is a short drive from New Orleans, is home to several plantations, including the Laura, a Creole plantation where some of the stories told on the tour are drawn from the extraordinary handwritten memoir of the woman who owned it until 1891.\n___\nYANKEE MAG'S WONDERS OF FALL\nLooking for things to do on a visit to New England this fall? Yankee magazine's September/October issue lists \"scenic wonders\" of fall along with tips for shooting autumn foliage and a list of great writers' homes worth visiting.\nYankee's list of fall wonders includes Jenne Farm, on Route 106 in central Vermont near Woodstock, which the magazine describes as \"the most photographed farm in New England\"; New Hampshire's Conway Scenic Railroad; the Kancamagus Highway, a 35-mile route between Lincoln and Conway, New Hampshire; Vermont's Northeast Kingdom region; Route 100 in Vermont; apple orchards that feature heirloom breeds; and the cranberry bogs that turn crimson in southeastern Massachusetts and parts of Maine and Rhode Island.\nThe writers' homes include Emily Dickinson's in Amherst, Massachusetts, Edith Wharton's estate in Lenox, Massachusetts, and Mark Twain's in Hartford, Connecticut.\n___\nMIDWEST CAMPUS GETAWAYS\nCollege towns aren't just for students or even alumni. The September/October issue of Midwest Living magazine suggests three campus getaways for fall where you can find everything from football and foliage to art and architecture.\nThe magazine featured Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Indiana University in Bloomington, and Michigan State University in East Lansing.\nMiami University was lauded for its lovely campus, including 19th century brick buildings, bridges crossing Four Mile Creek and lawns dotted with stands of trees. Other highlights: football games at Yager Stadium and nearby Hueston Woods State Park.\nIndiana University gets brownie points for performances by students from its highly esteemed Jacobs School of Music; its I.M. Pei-designed art museum, and cosmopolitan downtown Bloomington.\nAnd at Michigan State, take a photo with the bronze \"Sparty\" statue, then head to pregame parties for the Spartans team at The Rock, a giant painted boulder in a field along Farm Lane. Other attractions for those visiting Michigan State include the Lansing River Trail, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum and ice cream at the MSU Dairy Store.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T23:28:24.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
