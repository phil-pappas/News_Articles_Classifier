Make sure to check the government’s SmartTraveller advice pages for the latest information about what’s going on in the country you’re travelling to and make sure you are responsible.\nHere’s how to get the most out of your trip to more volatile areas, while staying safe in the process.\n1. San Pedro Sula, Honduras\nNotorious for its high murder rate, San Pedro Sula is the second-largest city in Honduras. Drug trafficking and gun running by locals gangs has kept the number of killings high in recent years. In 2014 the murder rate was 171 per 100,000 people and 97 per cent of homicides here go unsolved.\nWe advise you to avoid long stays and to focus on the other (many) wonders of Honduras and South America.\n2. Caracas, Venezuela\nCaracas is one of the most beautiful cities in South America, just a few kilometres away from the Caribbean Sea and surrounded by lush green hills. However, this charming city has a darker side: It has long been considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world.\nConstant fighting between gangs involved in the drugs trade makes the streets the setting for regular robberies and shootings, which tourists have been known to get caught up in, with tragic consequences.\nIf you decide to visit Caracas, rely on a trusted guide and keep your eyes open.\nBe careful in Caracas.

You’ll have your pick of white beaches and breathtaking sunsets. It’s also a holiday hotspot because of the luxury resorts there and the city’s wild night-life.\nHowever, clashes between police and drug cartels have become increasingly frequent and tourists become easy victims of violence.\nIf you’re hiring a car, make sure you avoid remote routes and only use toll roads. Never leave drinks or food unattended as there have been incidents of tourists being robbed after being drugged. Stay vigilant.\n4. Cape Town, South Africa\nWith plenty of gorgeous hotels and restaurants, all set under the majestic shadow of Table Mountain, Cape Town is a popular holiday spot, particularly for those thinking about hiring a car and heading out along the famed Garden Route to explore South Africa’s vineyards and larger untouched landscapes.\nBut it has a troubled and violent history, which in some districts lingers unpleasantly, presenting potential dangers to unaware tourists.\nSome parts are best not ventured into alone or at night, while others should be considered completely out of bounds. The areas with the highest murder rates tend not to be the high-profile tourist areas but the townships of the Cape Flats.\nSome of these sprawling suburbs are centres of poverty and a breeding ground for gang culture, which often sparks violent incidents.\nCape Town, South Africa, still has some struggles.

Karachi, Pakistan\nThe largest city in Pakistan, and the third-biggest in the world according to population figures, Karachi has been at the centre of a number of terrorist threats by Middle Eastern groups in recent years. Residents have witnessed local attacks and violent incidents in which tourists and innocent bystanders can be drawn into.\nNevertheless, the city has plenty to offer, particularly for partygoers. Karachi is also known as the City of Lights or as the city that never sleeps because of it’s vibrant night-life.\nPakistan is a wonderful country, but always consult the SmartTraveller site for areas where all but essential travel is advised.\n6. Detroit, Michigan, US\nOnce the car industry’s production capital, Motor City has played an important role in the birth of Motown and developing other musical genres, from blues to hip-hop to techno.\nUnfortunately, Detroit has also made the headlines for shootings and a general reputation for violence, due in large part to unemployment, poverty and a declining manufacturing industry. Lately, the homicide rate, mainly related to drug trafficking, seems to have lowered, but if you’re planning a trip always travel with caution and be on the lookout for any unsavoury situations.\nMotor City.

There are several other cities in Brazil with a higher crime rate — João Pessoa, for example, or Fortaleza.\nHowever, as the most popular tourist destination in the country, Rio is the place where the highest number of well-meaning tourists could find their travel plans scuppered.\nBe careful when taking money out from cash machines, as robberies have been known to happen at them, and avoid the favelas on the outskirts of Rio.\nThe situation has improved compared to 10 years ago, and you can definitely sip your caipirinha cocktail on Copacabana beach in relative safety, but try to avoid wearing expensive jewellery and carrying large sums of cash as a precaution.\nWhen in Rio, avoid the favelas.

Baghdad, Iraq\nDespite more than 10 years having passed since the start of the war in Iraq, levels of violence remain high and the threat of attack has not been eliminated.\nThe danger of gunfire, bombings, kidnappings and other attacks remains present in Baghdad and surrounding areas. Visitors to the city are advised to have plans in place in case they should need an emergency exit route as the airports are likely to close at short notice.\nIt’s also worth keeping an eye on media reports for the latest news on where to go and where to avoid.\n9. Cali, Colombia\nThe second-largest city in Colombia after the capital Bogota, Cali is one of the country’s most dangerous. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, it’s blessed with some of the most idyllic beaches in the Caribbean and is famous as the capital of salsa dancing.\nHowever, Colombia has a turbulent political legacy that it continues to wrestle with and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia continue to exert pressure and cause tensions in certain areas of Cali.\nRecent investments in security have caused a decline in the number of murders and violence in the city and it’s relatively safe, but vigilance is still urged when getting a taxi (only take official marked cabs) or travelling at night.\nA beach in Cali.

Guatemala City, Guatemala\nExperience the tale of two cities that Guatemala City, the country’s capital and the most populous city in all of Central America, has to tell.\nOn one side of the coin you’ll find beautiful landscapes — the city is situated in a valley — and fascinating cultures, which draw thousands of tourists each year. On the other is entrenched gang violence, theft, robbery and indiscriminate acts of crime, which are in some parts difficult to control.\nMost trips do go off without a hitch and are trouble-free, but be wary of occurrences of carjacking, particularly on Carretera Salvador, the main road from Guatemala City to the border with El Salvador.\nYou’ll find most cheap accommodation is located in Zone 1 of the city, the historical quarter. Take care around here as it’s a prime spot for criminals to target holiday-makers distracted by their new, and beautiful, surroundings.\nThis story originally appeared on Skyscanner.com.au .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a&h=Inside+the+world%26%238217%3Bs+most+dangerous+cities", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a&title=Inside+the+world%26%238217%3Bs+most+dangerous+cities", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Inside+the+world%26%238217%3Bs+most+dangerous+cities&c=FROM+a+sprawling%2C+stunning+place+where+poverty+and+gang+violence+is+rife%2C+to+a+city+with+a+troubled+past+that+still+lingers%2C+tourists+need+to+be+careful+here.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a&title=Inside+the+world%26%238217%3Bs+most+dangerous+cities", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-advice/inside-the-worlds-most-dangerous-cities/story-e6frfqfr-1227475887888?sv=3fa146aade13a4a5ed371314cc65438a", "http://www.lawg.org/action-center/lawg-blog/69-general/1421-san-pedro-sula-honduras-nearly-a-war-zone", "http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/karachi-population/"], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T18:28:43.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
