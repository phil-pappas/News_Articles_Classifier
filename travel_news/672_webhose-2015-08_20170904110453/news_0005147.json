It may be a special treat to enjoy spectacular view from a distance, but a dangerous situation and a State of emergency for the country. \nEcuador's President Rafael Correa declared a state of emergency Saturday as the dangerous Cotopaxi volcano rumbled to life and prompted evacuation orders in several villages threatened by landslides. \n\"As a precautionary measure, a total of 400 people have been evacuated,\" the president said in his radio and television address just before signing the decrees. \nThe volcano, which towers to 5,897 meters (19,350 feet) high, is considered one of the most threatening in the region -- both because of its size and because it is so close to well-populated towns. \nThe situation developing at Cotopaxi is a serious threat that has led the government to take urgent special measures to confront this eruptive process. \nThe volcano started to stir Friday, registering several small eruptions and angrily shooting plumes of dust and ash eight kilometers (five miles) into the sky. \nBy declaring a state of emergency -- also called a state of exception in Ecuador -- the president can direct resources and deploy military personnel to aid communities affected by the volcano's activity. \nEarlier, officials ordered what they called precautionary evacuations in villages near the volcano, warning residents of potential landslides of volcanic debris, or lahars. \nResidents in towns and river settlements in Cotopaxi province, just 45 kilometers south of the capital Quito, were told to clear out, said Pablo Morillo, head of the Risk Management Office. \nOfficials did not specify how many people could be affected by the evacuation order which affects three provinces with towns near the volcano. \nIn the city of Latacunga, home to about 170,000 people, sirens sounded as residents frantically fled, packing food, water and pets into cars that quickly clogged the roads. \nSoldiers could be seen in the streets of Latacunga, along with cars carrying mattresses, motorcycles and other household items. \nAuthorities maintained a yellow alert in the region, a mid-range warning, and said it would remain as long as Cotopaxi continued to stir. \nThe volcano spewed a current of hot glass and rock -- called pyroclastic flow -- which authorities warned could trigger avalanches or lahars. \nQuito Mayor Mauricio Rodas said one million surgical masks would be distributed across the city of 2.3 million people, to prevent inhalation of falling dust. \nSome residents could be seen wearing masks Friday as they fled villages, with a large, angry cloud of gray dust and ash forming over Cotopaxi. \nThe Environment Ministry has declared the volcano off limits to tourists, and 15 climbers who were preparing to scale the mountain were sent home Friday. \nCotopaxi is one of eight active volcanoes in Ecuador, a country that is part of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire that makes it prone to seismic and volcanic events. \nIts snow-covered tip has been described as \"majestic\" and is a popular climbing destination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T11:40:41.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
