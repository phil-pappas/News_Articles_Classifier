Looking at search data in June 2015, Hong Kongers plan their travels 66 days before departure – a full week ahead of the global average of 59 days. \nMalaysian travellers were top early travel-planners at 79 days, followed by Taiwan at 77 days. Travellers in China only start planning their travels 40 days ahead. \n\"The results show that Hong Kong outbound tourists plan well-ahead. This may be due to the fact that Hong Kong people are good at matching their travels with public holidays to get as much as they can out of trips,” said Fang Fang, Marketing Manager, Hong Kong and Taiwan, “Getting the best deal on your chosen route takes more than just checking flight fares 66 days beforehand. Savvy Hong Kong travelers can use tools like our Price Alerts to get latest price information on airfares automatically once they set-up their ideal travel dates and preferred airports.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T12:21:07.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
