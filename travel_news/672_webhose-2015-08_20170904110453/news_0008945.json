Delray Beach is a first-class resort destination and a diverse vibrant community situated on the Atlantic Ocean between Boca Raton and West Palm Beach. \neTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said of the nomination: “We were delighted to read that a Delray Beach visitor, Patricia Serrano from the Fresh Traveler blog, mentioned that Delray Beach won the designation of the ‘Most Fun Small Town in the USA.’ This was worth a follow up, for sure.” \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \n“Delray Beach is a precious gem of a town that combines a charming, beach town vibe with big city sophistication. Around here we say it’s where Key West meets Manhattan,” said Stephanie Immelman, Delray Beach Marketing Cooperative. \nDelray Beach is a small and intimate town with big city sophistication, and is 30-45 minutes from Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale International Airports, and only an hour north of Miami. Delray Beach celebrates its art, culture, and history. \nDelray Beach was named “Most Fun Small Town in the USA” by Rand McNally, USA Today, and the Travel Channel on a nationally-televised special, Best of the Road. There are plenty of reasons that Delray Beach won this award! \nDelray’s Atlantic Avenue, which runs through the center of town from I-95 to the ocean, is the longest main street in Florida. A popular destination for locals and visitors alike, Atlantic Avenue is a charming streetscape filled with upscale shops, fine restaurants, and nightly entertainment. The downtown is known, nationally, for its family-friendly festivals such as the Delray Affair and Delray Beach Garlic Fest and for its famous 100-foot Christmas tree, where visitors can walk inside to see animated displays, come for the tree lighting, and see Santa arrive via helicopter! \nDelray Beach’s booming art scene is an experience for the eyes and the soul! More than 20 galleries and public art pieces are located downtown and in the Pineapple Grove Arts District, home to Artists Alley, where visitors will find working artists in their studios. Gallery Walks draw visitors on Friday nights from October to April, as do free outdoor concerts from October through January at Delray Beach Center for the arts. Delray Beach’s signature event, On The Ave, always features food, music, and an outdoor art gallery. \nTo make a nomination for THE LIST, go to honesttravelawards.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:36:25.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
