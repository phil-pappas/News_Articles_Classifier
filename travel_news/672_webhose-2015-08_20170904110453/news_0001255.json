UNICEF can provide an entire class of 27 students with books for £10, while £15 is enough to buy 42 packets of therapeutic food – enough for a two-week treatment for a malnourished child.\nNorwegian CEO Bjørn Kjos said: “I would like to thank all of our wonderful passengers for their generosity so far this summer. More than £40,000 donated in just 6 weeks shows that if passengers contribute even a small amount, it can make a huge difference in helping give children all over the world a better future.”\nSecretary General Bernt G. Apeland of UNICEF Norway: “This shows that Norwegian’s customers want to contribute to making the world a better place for children. But it also shows that it is easier to support our work when it is easy to make donations, the way Amadeus and Norwegian have enabled customers to contribute online. I would like to thank both companies and all customers for their contribution.”\nNorwegian and UNICEF have had a signature partnership since 2007 with Norwegian introducing a number of initiatives to support UNICEF’s work. These include arranging fundraisers onboard and last year the airline filled a Boeing 737 with emergency aid to the Central African Republic. Additionally, Norwegian donates money to UNICEF as an alternative to giving its employees a Christmas present.\nSource:- Norwegian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T13:34:49.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
