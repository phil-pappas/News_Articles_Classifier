The four-year-old is co-owned by a leading bloodstock consultant who enjoyed an outstanding season as he also manages several top stallions including the big three last term — Captain Al, Trippi and Dynasty.\nInterestingly, when it came to the Cape annual awards, held jointly by the Racing Association and Cape Breeders Club, it was Dennis Drier’s sprinter, Captain Of All, who got the award for Horse of the Year.\nAs was the case with the national awards, Futura was voted Horse of the Year in the Cape Racing awards section. They gave an exceptional achievement award to trainer Stan Elley, who retired from the training ranks at the end of July.\nRobert Bloomberg, a legal expert and prominent owner for many years, was also rewarded with an industry service award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:57:13.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
