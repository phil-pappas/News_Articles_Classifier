The 1,800-square-foot space has a relaxed and inviting air and Maier’s love of collaborations and the inclusion of work from artist he admires also elevate the environment into something more personal. It’s almost as if shoppers will be getting a peek into the calm waters psyche of the designer himself and the brand he launched in 1997.\nTHE TEAM BEHIND JUGOFRESH OPENING A POP-UP RESTAURANT– The expanding jugofresh empire announced that the team behind the popular juice bar are opening a pop-up restaurant called r+d kitchen by jugofresh, opening August 1 inside the jugofresh location in South Pointe.
