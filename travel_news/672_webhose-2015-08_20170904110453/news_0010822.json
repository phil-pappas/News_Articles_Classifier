The New Zealand season ordinarily runs from mid-June to late September or early October. Coronet Peak originally planned to close on October 4 and Mt Hutt in September, but they may extend their ski season dates if conditions remain good and there’s enough demand. New Zealand has 23 ski areas, which receive a combined 1.4 million visitors each year. This figure is heavily influenced by snow conditions; a good season can bring the total up to 1.6 million. • The best hotels in New Zealand New Zealand's season normally runs from mid-June to early October Exact numbers have not yet been released but NZSki, which runs Coronet Peak, the Remarkables and Mt Hutt and boasts more than a third of the country's ski business, says it has had a record number of visitors so far this season. \"Everyone's talking about the best conditions in decades, it's just incredible down here,\" said Ross Copland, Coronet’s ski area manager. Coronet's current snow base depth ranges from 75cm to 165cm, compared to reaching just 75cm at its high point in 2014. The South Face on Mt Hutt was open last week for the first time since 2013 – it only offers off-piste runs but needs fairly substantial snowfall to be viable. Some ski resorts have said they may extend their season if conditions remain good Photo: www.brandon-stanley.com Craig Douglas, general manager of marketing at NZSki, said: \"Both of our Queenstown mountains and Mt Hutt have enjoyed an amazing season. This great snow cover is expected to extend through to October, making the most of spring skiing, which has the advantage of milder temperatures and longer daylight hours\". One of New Zealand's biggest ski areas, Treble Cone, last week enjoyed almost half a metre of fresh snow, prompting many to share their photos of the powder day on social media. So many great photos coming out of yesterdays 46cm powder day.
