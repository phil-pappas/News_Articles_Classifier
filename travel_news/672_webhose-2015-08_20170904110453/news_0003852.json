Fiona Duncan checks into a luxury fort in the middle of the solent and finds one of the most novel locations of any hotel in Britain By Fiona Duncan Comments \nI am nearly all at sea at this hotel. One is neither afloat nor on terra firma at No Man’s Fort : it’s parked in the middle of the Solent but you somehow expect it to be moving. Yet Seaview, an Edwardian town in the Isle of Wight , remains firmly in place in one direction, Portsmouth in the other. It’s a bit like being a flighty bird perched on the back of a particularly placid cow: there it has stood, our immovable circular fort, for 145 years, going nowhere, the tidal waters swirling around it. \nThe formula is confusing too: it feels like neither hotel nor themed attraction, but somewhere queasily in between (though things should improve as more features of a regular hotel – room service; room information; dining when you want, not at a set time – are implemented). \nThe circular circular sitting room at the top of the lighthouse has thrilling views. Photo: Anna Kunst Photography \nNo Man’s Fort opened in March, the latest in a collection of highly unusual places to stay dreamt up by entrepreneur Mike Clare, who set up AmaZing Venues after selling his bed business, Dreams, in 2008. As well as a tower in Scotland and a French-style château in Anglesey, among others, he has acquired three Solent forts: this one, open for one-night stays (you set off at noon by ferry from Portsmouth’s Gunwharf Quays and return at 10 o’clock the next morning); Spitbank, for weddings and corporate events; and Horse Sand, currently under renovation. \nBuilt by Lord Palmerston in response to a perceived invasion from France, the Solent’s “follies” were mocked as useless until the Second World War when they became valuable early warning posts during Portsmouth air raids; then the mocking stopped. \nA printed itinerary spells out the treats in store for guests, including “a glass of bubbly on arrival”. “So,” says my friend Widge (how come she is always with me on trips to bizarre hotels?), “this is going to be a 'bubbly’ sort of place, not a champagne one.” And she’s right: the fort is great fun but it’s not posh, with guests mingling, glasses of bubbly in hand, in the hot tubs on the AstroTurf roof, playing billiards and chatting after dinner around the firepit, warmed by blankets and mugs of hot chocolate. \nThe gun emplacements are now bedrooms. Photo: Anna Kunst Photography \nGuests (there are 23 bedrooms) have the fort to themselves and a sense of peace and privacy pervades. Best is the thrilling circular sitting room at the top of the lighthouse (the views!); most confusing are the brick-walled “street”, not unlike a back alley in Portsmouth, where the buffet lunch is served, and the twinkling lights of laser guns (for corporate shoot-outs) in the atmospheric, unrestored basement. \nThe gun emplacements are now bedrooms; the vast 12in (bore) guns have long gone, but the iron ceilings still remain. Plenty of space, excellent beds and modern bathrooms were enough to forgive the faux accessories – a small table masquerading as a pile of books and a chest of drawers as a pile of suitcases. As for the quotations everywhere (“We are all made of stars, and we deserve to twinkle”– Marilyn Monroe), enough already. Service is basic, but dinner, served in the Mess Hall, surprisingly good, the first course appearing in a mess tin. And nothing much could beat lying in bed with the blinds open, the moon shining on Seaview and the Solent lapping the fort’s stone walls. \nDoubles from £400 per night, including breakfast, dinner and transfers. Not suitable for guests using wheelchairs. Solent Forts Port Office, Canal Side, Gunwharf Quays, Portsmouth PO1 3FH (0330 333 7222; amazingvenues.co.uk ). If you can’t stay the night at No Man’s Fort, you can visit on a Wednesday: an “All Access Pass” costs £60 and includes a light lunch, returning at teatime; or go for Sunday lunch (£99).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:12:39.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
