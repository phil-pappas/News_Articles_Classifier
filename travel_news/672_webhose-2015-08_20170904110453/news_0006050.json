Inside the stunning... 114 shares It takes a special set of weather conditions for such a breath-taking sight to occur - circumhorizontal arcs most commonly occur in cirrus clouds but only when they're aligned horizontally.\nSo called 'fire rainbows,' which are actually formed in unique cloud conditions, are common in middle latitudes, like the southern United States. Pictured: Isle of Palms\nSO WHAT ARE 'FIRE RAINBOWS'? The phenomenon was first dubbed a 'fire rainbow' back in 2006, when one was spotted by a Washington journalist. And meteorologist Justin Lock told 14 News that a strict set of conditions are required for such phenomena to appear.\nThey only occur in high-level cirrus clouds, which usually form about 18,000ft. They appear thin and wispy and are made up of tiny ice crystals.\n'To produce the rainbow colours the sun's rays must enter the ice crystals at a precise angle to give the prism effect of the color spectrum,' Lock said, adding the sun must be at an altitude of at least 58 degrees above the horizon.\nThe same sort of thing occurs when we see coloruful sunsets. In those instances, high-level cirrus clouds produce many colours due to the sun's low angle, meaning that we see reds, oranges and purples.\nBecause such a specific angle is necessary for the colours to be visible, the phenomenon is most common at middle latitudes, which includes the southern United States.\n'You're more likely to see this type of rainbow during the summer in North America,' Dayna Vettese, a meteorologist at The Weather Network , explained.\n'But in places like Europe, the arcs are much rarer.'\nRead more: Rare 'fire rainbow' caught on camera - Tri-State News, Weather & Sports News - Rare fire rainbow spotted over South Carolina - The Weather Network", "external_links": ["http://www.14news.com/story/29803479/rare-fire-rainbow-caught-on-camera", "http://dailym.ai/1PnLQjY", "http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/rare-fire-rainbow-spotted-over-south-carolina/55900/"], "published": "2015-08-20T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:00:17.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
