It translates roughly to coffee break, but its more. It always includes a little bit of something to accompany the rich dark coffee. Usually something sweet. Fika is a rule of hospitality in any Swedish home, and almost obligatory if you meet someone you know while shopping. For a traveler, its a perfect way to take a break, rest feet, check email or figure out where you are and where to go next. Mostly its about stopping whatever youre doing to enjoy the moment. Those moments are worth enjoying when they bring any of the many varieties of traditional cookies, bars, buns, cakes and tarts youll find at almost any time of day or night. Its unthinkable for a coffee shop or café to run out. But Im not in Sweden now, and dont expect to be for a while, so I was overjoyed to receive a review copy of Fika: The Art of the Swedish Coffee Break , by Anna Brones and Johanna Kindvall. So overjoyed that I sat right down to read its delightful introduction and chapters about the history and customs that have grown around fika. Its even developed a vocabulary of its own. As a traveler and visitor to Swedish homes, I didnt realize that businesses have fika rooms where employees enjoy their fika breaks. But it was the recipes that really interrupted my work day. Summer didnt see the right season to bake vetebullar , the delicious cinnamon and cardamom buns Id relished with my fika on an October afternoon in Stockholm. But havreflarn med choklad bake for less than 10 minutes and I couldnt resist whipping up a batch. These ginger-scented oat crisps are sandwiched with a layer of bittersweet chocolate in the center, indescribably delicious. Ditto the apelsinsnittar , a sugar cookie dough baked with a filling of ground almond and orange zest. The recipe directions are clear, the ingredients all readily available. The recipes are illustrated by artist and co-author Johanna Kindvall, whose cooking blog, Kokblog, has just joined my list of favorites. Her gift of translating food into deceptively simple line drawings and color washes fits Anna Brones deft writing style perfectly. Youll have to excuse me now. Its time for my afternoon fikapaus. <BR>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:16:30.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
