I only pack Benjamins.\" Justin Block Associate Sports Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/31/2015 10:39 AM EDT \nA back-of-the-envelope packing list for any travel situation calls for sets of clothes, toiletries, a toothbrush, phone chargers -- basically, anything you 100 percent use every single day to present yourself as the best possible version of yourself. \nFloyd Mayweather's best possible version of himself is intrinsically tied to his money. If a day goes by where he's not presenting his money to the public, Mayweather is decidedly not himself. Here's how he's handling a travel day: Aug 30, 2015 at 11:50pm PDT \n\"Packing light\" never looked so impractical. \n\"When I travel I don't pack clothes. I only pack Benjamins,\" his Monday morning Instagram caption read. \nAs for those things every traveler brings -- those small toothpaste tubes, snacks for the plane -- Mayweather is apparently above all that. He just needs cash and a designer bag to get ready for a trip to the airport. \nWith his pay rocketing to $300 million in 2015 according to Forbes, and more on the way from an upcoming Sept. 12 fight , Mayweather can simply buy whatever he needs wherever he is and dispose of it, a la Allen Iverson during his days with the Philadelphia 76ers . \nPresumably, Mayweather's stacks of cash were already bagged up by the bank, but packing it this way is much more fun. Let's withdraw a ton of cash, lay it out on the bed and show me packing it. ï»¿ \nMayweather is pretty quick to boast about his paychecks. At least he now has the visual element to back it up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:56:44.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
