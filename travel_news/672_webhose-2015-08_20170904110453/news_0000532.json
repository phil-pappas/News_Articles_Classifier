The success of the forum prompted a strong recommendation that it be held annually. \nThe forum was organized by the Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in association with the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage the Arab Tourism Organization and the Taif Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \nSessions were on global and Arab experiences in the safety and security of tourist facilities chaired by Mohammad Hamaid Al-Thaqafi and Abdullah Al-Shahri who also presented a paper on combining government and community efforts to maintain the safety of heritage villages modeled on a village located in the Rijal Alma region in Asir which is host to a unique experiment as its maintenance is now conducted in cooperation with the villagers and government authorities. \nIn addition Al-Shahri acknowledged the efforts of the village residents for the establishment of a museum as well as a development committee for the wellbeing of the village. \nAhmad Omos representative of the Moroccan Ministry of Culture presented a paper titled 'Rock Art in Morocco.'
