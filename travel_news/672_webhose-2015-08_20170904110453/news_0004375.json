It also governs player welfare programmes and club v country issues over international call-ups.\nWanderers grind out FFA Cup win over Roar 1:12 Play video\nJohn Aloisi is off to a rough start as Brisbane Roar coach, after a loss to Western Sydney in the FFA Cup.\nSky News 12 Aug 2015 Sport The MoU expires tomorrow, and FFA have written to the PFA to say it will not roll over while negotiations continue. It has underpinned all negotiations for the past eight years, but talks over a “whole-of-game” collective pay deal - taking in the Socceroos, Matildas and the A-League - have foundered in recent months, with claims of officials storming out of meetings as tensions have risen.\nThe PFA were angered by changes to the salary cap rules announced yesterday, they claim without any consultation and which freeze the overall cap for the next two seasons - although greater allowances outside it were also introduced.\n“The announcement unilaterally imposes the salary cap freeze rejected by the players in the CBA negotiations which will largely undermine the reforms and place even greater pressure on the A-League’s core player group,” said PFA CEO Adam Vivian.\n“FFA has left the PFA and the players with no option but to take the necessary steps to secure the rights and wellbeing of Socceroos, Matildas and A-League players under Australian industrial law.”\nLions through to final 16 after defeating the Kings 2-1 0:31 Play video\nFootball: The Queensland Lions are through to the final 16 of the FFA Cup after defeating the Croydon Kings 2-1 at Elite Systems Football Centre in Adelaide.\nFox Sports 06 Aug 2015 News It’s understood that all options are now on the table, including industrial action for the first time.\nBut A-League boss Damien De Bohun rejected the idea that FFA would seek to derecognise the union, and said the union had been advised of the salary cap changes a week ago.\nHe insisted that all the changes to the salary cap had been made under the terms of the MoU, and said FFA wanted to introduce a new version of it to replace historical provisions that no longer applied.\n“FFA continues to be committed to ensuring an appropriate MoU is agreed between FFA and the PFA, alongside any CBA, and any assertion that FFA has no intention to move forward without a CBA or MOU is scurrilous,” he said.\n“The fact remains that the current MOU expires on Friday and after eight years the details of some aspects are now out-dated and need to be altered to reflect the current landscape, which the FFA is committed to resolving.\n“Over the last six months, the FFA and PFA have had more than 20 meetings in relation to the CBA.”\nOriginally published as A-League player strike a step closer", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/Y4N3l4djqBTtHYnir9eyDeesFA6HN8ZA/promo263600680&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/08/06/FSD_060815_PFFA_QLD_LIONS_DEF_CROY_VSV.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/football/a-league-player-strike-now-a-possibility-as-pay-row-worsens/story-fnk6pqot-1227480018012"], "published": "2015-08-12T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:47:22.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
