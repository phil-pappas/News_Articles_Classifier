Echoing Janet Street-Porter's sentiments earlier this year that growing old gracefully needn't be hard , Hall branded women who have had plastic surgery \"bitter\" and \"weak\". In an interview for the Radio Times she said: \"It's ridiculous to imagine you can stay young forever and live forever. It's taking away from young people. There's a beauty and respect in age. Magazines and media are disrespectful of age .\" She boasted about never having \"done a single thing to my face\" and added that she'd never consider having plastic surgery: \"You know some women take fat from their bottom and put it in their upper lip? Then you're kissing their ass.\" Recent statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons found that, amongst the over 55s, over 3.9 million cosmetic procedures were undergone in 2014, up 4 per cent from the previous year. The most popular surgical procedure was breast augmentation while the top three \"minimally invasive\" procedures were Botox , cellulite treatment, and microdermabrasion. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn were obsessed with recapturing their youth in Death Becomes Her (Film Stills) Hall has stated that she looks \"pretty good\" for her age and has said she doesn't exercise, her preferred physical activities being; sex, gardening and housework. Hall's tips for ageing well? \"I smoke, I drink, I have fun. Laughing a lot is really good for you, embracing your children's embracing your grandchildren, and not having regrets, and not being bitter, and not being angry.\" Chris Minett, managing director of The Positive Ageing Company , would not go as far as to brand women \"weak\" for choosing cosmetic surgery, though he does believe we need to be more respectful of age: \"As a society we need to do more to recognise, embrace, and celebrate ageing.\" He went on to add that Hall's comments can be attributed to the fact she is a member of the Baby Boomer generation : \"They were the hippies in the 60's, the punks in the 70's, the Yuppies in the 80's, the environmentalists in the 90's and the architects of corporate responsibility, work/life balance, diversity and inclusion in the boardrooms of the 00's. Now into their late 50's and 60's , the Baby Boomers like Jerry continue to redefine society and culture to meet their needs, reflecting the world through their lens.\" @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:23:07.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
