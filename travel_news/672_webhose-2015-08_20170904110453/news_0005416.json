OVSICORI previously had recorded temperatures up to 600 C (1,112 F) so comparatively, experts say, the volcano’s current activity can be considered low.\nThe volcano, located in Cartago province some 40 miles east of the capital San José, was frequently active from February through May of this year, spewing ash and vapor over the Central Valley, closing the airport on several occasions and forcing neighbors to evacuate.\nBrowse The Tico Times’ volcano coverage\nSince May the number of quakes has decreased and OVSICORI’s station at the volcano has only recorded tremors caused by the movement of materials and fluids in the inner crater, vulcanologist María Martínez confirmed.\nGas spewings, which at some point reached 5,000 tons per day, have gradually declined to 300 tons or less, the report adds.\nThe decreased activity is classified as normal, but OVSICORI experts say gas and ash explosions similar to those experienced on Saturday, could still occur.\nActivity at Turrialba peaked between October and May, and despite the problems caused by the volcano during the latter part of its peak, the volcanologists’ report states that the biggest explosion was actually recorded on Oct. 29 at 11 p.m.\nThe National Emergency Commission (CNE) is still keeping a two kilometer perimeter around the crater closed to tourists. A Yellow (preventive) Alert also remains in place for the Cartago cantons of Turrialba and Alvarado.\nSee a video of the recent explosion recorded by OVSICORI\nTico Times reporter Zach Dyer contributed to this story.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/OVSICORI/videos/vb.106757629361504/877938892243370/?type=2&#038;theater"], "published": "2015-08-19T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:29:59.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
