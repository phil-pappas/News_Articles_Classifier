The Chicago-based airline (NYSE: UAL) will unveil its latest onboard safety video on Sept. 25. But United is launching this new iteration of its safety video — intended to instruct and entertain — with a lot of additional fanfare that includes a feature film-style trailer. You know the kind of trailer I'm talking about — a preview of what's to come edited and supplied with voiceover ad copy and lush musical underscoring specifically designed to whet the appetite for the video itself. Though many viewers said they liked last year's unusual United safety video, I personally was not a huge fan because it seemed to pull too much focus from the safety matters that should have been front and center. Instead the 2014 video seemed more intent on giving viewers a quick world tour, emphasizing hot destinations in United's global route network. Now comes the trailer for the new 2015 inflight safety video, which suggests United is positioning this latest presentation as a sequel to last year's \"Safety Is Global\" video from United ad agency or record McGarryBowen New York. Clearly, someone was determined to have fun trying to mimic the familiar movie trailer template on display every day in cinemas around the world. Though the new United safety video trailer may not fully reflect the finished product that will begin appearing on board United airplanes next month, plenty of humor — for better or worse — has been injected into the frenetic preview. There are action-packed shots of a colorful Chinese dragon thrashing about, a sighting of a silly rendition of a Loch Ness-type creature lurking in the shallows with a fishing net and a golf cart run amok. There's also a fleeting glimpse of a fight atop a moving ski lift gondola that could have been lifted directly out of some \"Mission Impossible\" stunt sequence. Still it's all just a souped-up sampler of the finished safety video. One thing is clear though. United is sticking with its overarching global tour concept in this safety video sequel. Just how much the new version improves on — or falls short of — what came out last year won't be known for a while longer. \nGet Chicago  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T22:29:16.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
