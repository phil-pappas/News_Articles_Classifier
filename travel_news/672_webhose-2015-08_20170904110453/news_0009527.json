The rail carrier says Friday it'll add 34 extra trains for Francis' Sept. 26-27 Philadelphia stop and lengthen regularly scheduled trains while Francis is in New York and Washington. Some of the extra trains will use equipment borrowed from regional commuter rail lines. Reservations are required for Acela, Northeast Regional and Keystone Service trains Sept. 25-28. Amtrak could be vital to Philadelphia-bound travelers. About 25 miles of highway and downtown streets will be closed and the region's commuter rail has a cap of 175,000 daily riders. Amtrak says there won't be taxis or rental cars at Philadelphia's 30th Street Station during the visit, and only outside bathrooms will be open. --- This story has been revised to show Amtrak has corrected its total for extra trains to 34, instead of 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T06:05:12.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
