The Mixologists are re-discovering the amazing products such as Jagermiester, Campari, dark cacao liqueur, southern comfort, angostura orange bitter and more, citing their lower strength but their deep and complex flavors. A few new nouveau Chinese tapas are designed to pair with these cocktails served daily from 11am – 12 midnight. \n“Bitter to cocktails equals to umami to culinary,” shared W Taipei Beverage & Food Director Patrick Duff. “Most of the liqueurs and bitters we used are made from a wine base fortified with herbs, spices and other botanicals which create this obsessive bitter-sweet taste into the cocktails created.” The cocktail “Blossom Fragrance” is made with homemade Chamomile infused tanqueray gin, southern comfort, chamomile tea, lime juice and honey. Southern comfort, whiskey-flavored liqueur, plays the magic here and gives forth the apricot fruity flavors to the drink that matches its name. Forget about the having coffee out of mug, since YEN Bar is serving the latest “Goring Schnaps Iced Coffee” form a wine glass with Jagermiester, campari, dark cacao liqueur, expresso, egg white and cream – stronger and darker! On the contrary, like a sarcastic lady in her passionate red color dress, “Gordon Rogue Romance” made with Campari, angostura orange bitter, grand marnier and grapefruit juice tastes richly rewarding with her unique bittersweet taste. Do not be fooled by the light pink color cocktail “Bitter Harmonious,” it may appear less provocative in color than the previous cocktail, with the mixture of the ingredients of Belvedere pomarancza vodka, st. germain elderflower liqueur, d.o.m, campari, grapefruit juice, lime juice, elderflower syrup, tonic water can be as strong as the cocktail Around the World.
