The unwelcome visitors, who arrived in early summer, were gone within a few weeks, but these nomad jellyfish -- Rhopilema nomadica -- are a symptom of a much bigger problem. They're not supposed to be here -- or anywhere along the Levantine basin or the eastern Mediterranean Sea for that matter. In fact, they are natives of the Indian Ocean, thousands of miles away. Marine biologist Bella Galil says they came through the Suez Canal -- just one of a number of invasive species now making their home in the Mediterranean. \"We have this corridor pushing in all the alien species, who just push them out and replace them with a fauna, which is not the native one,\" says Galil, a marine biologist with Israel's National Institute of Oceanography. 6 photos: Six most dangerous species 'invading' through Suez Canal Suez Canal 'invaders': Six most dangerous species – 1. Nomad jellyfish ( Rhopilema nomadica ): This jellyfish is native to the Indian Ocean. It forms huge swarms along the Levant coast, eating a hole in the food web by preying on zooplankton.

Marbled rabbitfish ( Siganus rivulatus ): The rabbitfish eats only algae, but reproduces so quickly that enormous schools strip the algae from an entire area and create barren regions.

Devil Firefish ( Pterois miles ): This invasive fish has venomous spines and few predators. First spotted in the Mediterranean in 1992, it can now be found in the waters off Lebanon, Cyprus, and Turkey. Hide Caption 6 of 6 Invasive species like the nomad jellyfish replace the region's native marine life, changing the ecosystem and the environment dramatically -- and quickly. And Galil predicts the problem will only get worse with the recent expansion of the Suez Canal. Take the marbled rabbitfish, for example. It eats only algae, which sounds innocent enough. But it earned its quirky name because of its procreation habits: It reproduces like -- you guessed it -- a rabbit. And the enormous schools of rabbitfish that form as a result can quickly strip a habitat of all its algae. \"The habitat is cut like a forest,\" says Galil. \"Nothing could exist and those species lose their place in the Mediterranean.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:08:33.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
