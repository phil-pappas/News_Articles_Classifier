Executive Chef Ed Cooney and master Pastry Chef Paul Kelly create eye catching treats, each inspired by a work of art from the hotel’s collection, pushing the boundaries of pastry making. \nThe pastries are each a ravishing masterpiece in their own right and include witty interpretations of Pauline Bewick’s Path Moorea, Mainie Jellett’s Madonna and Child and John Doherty’s The Old Fox. Each comes served with a miniature easel with a copy of the painting, letting visitors truly have their cake – and art – and eat it. Guests can go one step further to explore more of The Merrion’s art collection with a major new Audio Art Guide, launched this summer and specially commissioned by the hotel from Acoustiguide – supplier of audio guides to Le Louvre, MOMA, Gallery Borghese. An in depth guide to 20 paintings in the collection, the audio guide reveals the secrets of The Merrion’s collection and puts the paintings into context. Art Tea at The Merrion, Dublin is €35 per person or €45 per person including the Audio Art Guide Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T17:37:51.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
