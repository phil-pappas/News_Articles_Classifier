EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to that recorded by other companies. EBITDA is included herein because it is a basis upon which the Company assesses its operating performance and because the Company believes that it presents useful information to investors regarding a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended Jun 30,\n2014\n2015\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nunless otherwise stated)\nNet income attributable to AMPNI shareholders\n9,323\n7,148\nAdd: Net financing cost including amortization of financing costs\n8,530\n8,813\nAdd: Income tax expense/ (benefit)\n1,269\n(543)\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs\n7,618\n8,634\nEBITDA\n26,740\n24,052\n2.\nGross spread on marine petroleum products represents the margin the Company generates on sales of marine fuel and lubricants. Gross spread on marine fuel represents the margin that the Company generates on sales of various classifications of marine fuel oil (\"MFO\") or marine gas oil (\"MGO\"). Gross spread on lubricants represents the margin that the Company generates on sales of lubricants. Gross spread on marine petroleum products, gross spread of MFO and gross spread on lubricants are not items recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of gross spread may not be the same as that used by other companies in the same or other industries. The Company calculates the above-mentioned gross spreads by subtracting from the sales of the respective marine petroleum product the cost of the respective marine petroleum product sold and cargo transportation costs. For arrangements in which the Company physically supplies the respective marine petroleum product using its bunkering tankers, costs of the respective marine petroleum products sold represents amounts paid by the Company for the respective marine petroleum product sold in the relevant reporting period. For arrangements in which the respective marine petroleum product is purchased from the Company's related company, Aegean Oil S.A., or Aegean Oil, cost of the respective marine petroleum products sold represents the total amount paid by the Company to the physical supplier for the respective marine petroleum product and its delivery to the custom arrangements in which the Company purchases cargos of marine fuel for its floating storage facilities, transportation costs may be included in the purchase price of marine fuels from the supplier or may be incurred separately from a transportation provider. Gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold represents the margin the Company generates per metric ton of marine fuel sold. The Company calculates gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold by dividing the gross spread on marine fuel by the sales volume of marine fuel. Marine fuel sales do not include sales of lubricants. The following table reflects the calculation of gross spread per metric ton of marine fuel sold for the periods presented:\nFor the Three Months Ended June 30,\n2014\n2015\nSales of marine petroleum products\n1,705,188\n1,189,488\nLess: Cost of marine petroleum products sold\n(1,627,122)\n(1,117,715)\nGross spread on marine petroleum products\n78,066\n71,773\nLess: Gross spread on lubricants\n(585)\n(979)\nGross spread on marine fuel\n77,481\n70,824\nSales volume of marine fuel (metric tons)\n2,659,620\n3,150,950\nGross spread per metric ton of marine\nfuel sold (U.S. dollars)\n29.1\n22.5\n3.\nSales volume of marine fuel is the volume of sales of various classifications of MFO and MGO for the relevant period and is denominated in metric tons. The Company does not use the sales volume of lubricants as an indicator.\nThe Company's markets include its physical supply operations in the United Arab Emirates, Gibraltar, Jamaica, Singapore, Northern Europe, Vancouver, Portland (U.K.), Trinidad and Tobago (Southern Caribbean), Tangiers (Morocco), Las Palmas, Tenerife, Barcelona, Algeciras, Hamburg, US and Greece, where the Company conducts operations through its related company, Aegean Oil.\n4.\nBunkering fleet comprises both bunkering vessels and barges.\n5.\nFigure represents average bunkering fleet number for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each bunkering tanker or barge was used as part of the fleet during the period divided by the cumulative number of calendar days in the period multiplied by the number of bunkering tankers at the end of the period. This figure does not take into account non-operating days due to either scheduled or unscheduled maintenance.\n6.\nSpecial Purpose Vessels consists of the Orion, a 550 dwt tanker which is based in our Greek market.\n7.\nThe Company owns one barge, the Mediterranean, as a floating storage facility in Greece. The Company also operates on-land storage facilities in Portland, Las Palmas, Fujairah, Tangiers, Panama, U.S.A., Hamburg and Barcelona.\nThe ownership of storage facilities allows the Company to mitigate its risk of supply shortages. Generally, storage costs are included in the price of refined marine fuel Quote: d by local suppliers. The Company expects that the ownership of storage facilities will allow it to convert the variable costs of this storage fee mark-up per metric ton Quote: d by suppliers into fixed costs of operating its owned storage facilities, thus enabling the Company to spread larger sales volumes over a fixed cost base and to decrease its refined fuel costs.\n8.\nWorking capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities. Working capital excluding cash and debt is defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents minus restricted cash minus current liabilities plus short-term borrowings plus current portion of long-term debt.\n9.\nNet income as adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation, provision for doubtful accounts, restricted stock, amortization, deferred income taxes, loss on sale of vessels, net, impairment losses, unrealized loss/(gain) on derivatives and unrealized foreign exchange loss/(gain), net, is used to assist in evaluating our ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items is not recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator of the Company's performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSecond Quarter 2015 Dividend Announcement\nOn August 17, 2015 , the Company's Board of Directors declared a second quarter 2015 dividend of $0.02 per share payable on September 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of August 31, 2015 . The dividend amount was determined in accordance with the Company's dividend policy of paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis subject to factors including the requirements of Marshall Islands law, future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects and such other factors as are determined by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company anticipates retaining most of its future earnings, if any, for use in operations and business expansion.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc. will conduct a conference call and simultaneous Internet webcast on Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time , to discuss its second quarter results.
