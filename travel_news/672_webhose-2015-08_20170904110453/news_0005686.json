The venue is home to red-carpet film premieres and is part of SXSW and the Austin Film Festival.\nThe original Paramount sign, which was first installed on the theater’s facade in 1930, was taken down for restoration in the 1960s and was never seen again. Organizers have re-created the sign with historical accuracy, reviewing photos and videos with the help of Wagner Sign Co.\nThere will be multiple sites with prime views of the ceremony, including a street party on Congress Avenue with music by New Breed Brass Band. After the relighting of the sign, which is 50 feet tall and 7,100 pounds, the party will continue inside with a CD-release show for singer-songwriter Patty Griffin.\nAdditional private parties include the Terrace Bar at the InterContinental Stephen F. Austin, the Contemporary Austin, the Townsend and private residences nearby. Multiple packages and ticket options are available online.\nContact: 512-474-1221; austintheatre.org\nBASTROP Art conference to feature classes, events for all skill levels Celebrate all things related to art at the Lost Pines Regional Arts Conference, hosted by the Bastrop Fine Arts Guild.
