My options: The 49ers’ first game of the season, against the Green Bay Packers. The America’s Cup sailing races. Or I could get lost.\nAfter a horrendously long line at the car rental center, I was free. So I disappeared into the fog and clouds shrouding the Pacific Coast Highway and headed south with absolutely no destination in mind.\nI drove through tunnels carved out of the mountains and stopped at a few state beaches; at one, I watched a wedding out on the cliffs among the crashing waves.\nBack in the car, I drove toward San Gregorio, a town that you can easily miss. I know because I drove right through it and ended up on a pine tree–bordered ribbon of asphalt that felt like it would go on forever.\nA few people milled around outside the San Gregorio General Store, smoking cigarettes and talking about the motorcycles they’ve owned over the years. Inside, I found a bar with regular patrons, a guitar duo, and, of course, a full-on store. I ordered a Pacifico, grabbed a seat, and watched the guitarists jam out. Then I congratulated them, threw a couple of wrinkled dollars in their bucket, and walked back out into the world.\nThe day could have been so different: crammed into a stadium or bar half-watching sports. But this was much more rewarding. Hours prior, I was on a flight with the masses, going through the motions. Then I was out on my own, having an unexpected and unrepeatable experience.\nI learned something on September 8: Don’t be afraid to get lost—on purpose or otherwise—and have zero expectations. It will be good for you. I promise.\nHave you had any similar experiences?
