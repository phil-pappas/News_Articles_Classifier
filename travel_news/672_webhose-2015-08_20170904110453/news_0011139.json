Crystal Bridges announced the acquisition of what is known as the Bachman-Wilson House in 2014, after it was determined by then-owners Lawrence and Sharon Tarantino, an architect/design team who restored the house after buying it in 1988, that it was endangered by repeated flooding in its original location along New Jersey’s Millstone River. The home has since been assembled, transported and reconstructed on the museum’s grounds, along trails overlooking woodlands and a spring. Construction is now in its final stages, said the museum in announcing the public opening date. \nThe interior view of Frank Loyd Wright’s Bachman-Wilson House. — Picture courtesy of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art \nReservations to visit the house will be accepted starting on November 2; visits are free, but advance tickets are required. In addition to the tours, the museum says it is considering a variety of possible uses for the house and plans to gauge interest in the months following its opening. — AFP-Relaxnews  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:09:04.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
