A news report running in the Nanjing-based Yangtse Evening Post on 26 April 2007 triggered Zhou's revelation of those tragic memories that had been locked away for more than 70 years. 'I was a comfort woman, too' The newspaper published an article about the death of Lei Guiying, Nanjing’s last living “comfort woman” and witness to the dark history. Lei died of a cerebral hemorrhage at Jiangsu Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine at the age of 79. Lei was the only surviving “comfort woman” in Nanjing to have stood up and testified against the outrage of the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II, and her death marked the passing of the last local woman with the courage to accuse her abusers. Proof: Zhou Fenying's certificate recognising her as a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre Tears brimmed over Zhou Fenying’s blind eyes and trickled down her cheek when she heard Lei’s story read by her son. Zhou, 91 years old then, sobbed out the truth: “I was a ‘comfort woman’, too.” Zhou was only 22 years old when she and her cousin were captured by Japanese soldiers and tied up, after they were found hidden behind a millstone in a villager’s courtyard in 1938. Zhou was not the only “comfort woman” still alive at that time, but most survivors were unwilling to disclose their identities and openly accuse the Japanese army. No 1 Shijia Alley In June 2007, Zhou, who was being carried by her son, pointed to the alley where she and other good-looking women were unloaded from a wheelbarrow in 1938 and forced into sex slavery by Japanese aggressors. According to Yang Chunhe, the president of Baipu Historical and Cultural Studies Association, the place used to be the Zhongxing Hotel and was converted into a \"comfort station\". War zone: No 1 Shijia Alley, the original site of the Zhongxing Hotel After the death of Lei, Zhou picked up the baton to become the only living wartime “comfort woman” in Jiangsu province to openly admit to her past. Her courageous action fills the void of the records of surviving witnesses at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders. Only a one year after the disclosure of her identity, Zhou she passed away at home, aged 92. Eight years later, Zhou’s story is still widely spread and respected. Yang, who has contributed to local historical and cultural studies for years, said that people should always remember what had happened on this land. 'History is history' No one can change history. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called wartime “comfort women” victims of “human trafficking” in a question-and-answer session after addressing Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, US, in April. His evasion of the politically heated issue and adherence to Japan’s unapologetic attitude have aroused an uproar in international media. Place of atrocity: Yang Chunhe outside the old site of the \"comfort station\" in No 1 Shijia Alley “It is ridiculous that Abe called Japan’s anti-human crime ‘local prostitution trade’. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be?” said Yang, who was furious at Japan’s right-wing comments on the issue of “comfort women”. Abe, like his predecessor, has always denied that the Japanese government or the military directly forced women into sexual slavery. \"History is history. No one can change a bit of it,\" said Yang.
