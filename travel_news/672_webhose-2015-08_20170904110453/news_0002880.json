Other services to the East also saw an increase, with now double-daily flights to Abu Dhabi with Etihad and extra flights to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, all contributing to the increased range of options available to passengers flying from Manchester.\nThere has also been an 11% increase in the number of private jets using Manchester Airport and the airport has seen many footballers heading home for a few weeks leave before the start of the new Premier League season. The major clubs in the area all flew from Manchester on private flights for their pre-season tours.\nThe amount of air freight handled through Manchester also increased for the sixth consecutive month – boosted by the improving economy. In July, 8,856 tonnes of air freight was handled– an increase of 4.2% on the same period last year. It takes the rolling annual total of cargo for Manchester Airport to 99,805 tonnes.\nSource:- Manchester Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:19:14.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
