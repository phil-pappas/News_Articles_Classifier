We've had to send three people over every day to help maintain order and traffic.\" \nA 20-year-old woman, who identified herself as Mimi, said while waiting in a long line for photos on Tuesday: \"The two boxes are really cute. We saw them on Internet, so we decided to have some photos with them.\" \nA bride and groom were also waiting their turn to pose with the postboxes. \n\"I've never seen such thing during a career of more than 30 years,\" a postman, who was helping to manage the queue, told AFP. \n\"This could be the only happy event I could think of from the typhoon,\" he said. \nTyphoon Soudelor -- which hit in the early hours of Saturday and was billed as this year's most powerful storm -- uprooted trees, brought down electricity poles and knocked out power to a record 4.3 million households, leaving eight dead and four missing.
