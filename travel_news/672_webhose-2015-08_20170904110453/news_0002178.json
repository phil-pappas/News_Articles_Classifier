The Kansas City Streetcar Authority Inc. wants people to respect the rail. Kansas City's streetcar vehicles will debut on Main Street soon and the Kansas City Streetcar Authority Inc. wants people to show some respect to the streetcar. The nonprofit charged with managing the day-to-day operations of the forthcoming 2.2-mile streetcar line began rolling out a safety campaign designed to inform motorists, cyclist and pedestrians about coexisting with the streetcar vehicles that will be rolling through the River Market and up and down Main Street. The rollout of the blue and yellow signs emblazoned with safety tips has already begun in the Crossroads Arts District, Tom Gerend , executive director of the authority, said. For now, downtown commuters and visitors should be aware of new parking regulations and parking enforcement by the Kansas City Police Department. Since July, the department has been issuing citations for parking violations. Specifically, parking outside the white lines painted in designated parking areas. Gerend said penalties range from $25 to $500 for those violations. When the streetcar is running, an improperly parked car can block the streetcar's passage — and choke up traffic — so some cars will need to be towed to prevent major traffic snarls. Gerend said decisions to tow will ultimately be made by the police, but when the decision to tow is made a tow can be done in about 10 minutes. He said the authority's operations committee will monitor the towing procedures and establish targets related to the towing performance in the coming months. Kari Thompson , a public information officer with the police department, said it has not seen an uptick in citations along the streetcar line since the city's new regulation came into effect in July. She said the department's parking enforcement officers will only call for a tow after attempts have been made to locate the owner of the car and have them move it. A tow is the last-resort option. Thompson could not comment on how long it might take a tow to occur after an officer has called for a truck. The department's enforcement activity along the streetcar line, she said, could change when the streetcar is actually running. Safely crossing the tracks The authority also wants bikers to use designated bike-ways and to cross the streetcar tracks at a 90-degree angle. In other U.S. cities with streetcars, there are reports of incidents of bicycle wheels getting caught in the streetcar's track, causing the bicyclist to be ejected from their seat and land head-first on the street. Signs showing a biker being thrown from a bike have already appeared along the streetcar line. \"(We're) encouraging bicyclists to use signed and designated bike routes and crossings,\" Gerend said. \"We don't want to encourage folks riding on top of the track slab or parallel to the tracks. It's that circumstance that allows people to get their tires caught in tracks and we want to avoid that.\" Gerend said passing the tracks at a 90-degree angle will prevent accidents. He said the city's planned move to install bike lanes on Grand Boulevard will give bikers a safer north-south path through Downtown. A release from the streetcar authority said the same 90-degree rule should be applied to people using wheelchairs, strollers and scooters. In addition, the authority will be encouraging motorists to share the road and not double park and for pedestrians and cyclists to look before crossing the street and use designated crosswalks. The safety campaign will be promoted online in the coming weeks and months, Gerend said. The streetcar authority is looking for a contractor who can help it develop short video messages as part of the public safety campaign . The contract is for as much as $25,000. \nWant Kansas City Travel   Kansas City Streetcar Authority Inc.
