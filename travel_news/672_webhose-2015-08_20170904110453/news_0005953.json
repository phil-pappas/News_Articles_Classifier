Agarwal is 21, and demographically aligned to a youthful country full of young entrepreneurs. Using technology and standardization, he is building what is one of the few non-copycat startups in an India with many Uber and Amazon imitators. OYO Rooms currently offers 14,000 rooms in 80 cities. His closest branded hotel competitor is India’s iconic Taj Hotels, run by conglomerate Tata’s Indian Hotels, whose current inventory of about 9,000 rooms, albeit in the upper end of the hospitality segment, is to double soon .\nThe two-year old OYO is Uber-like and not an Airbnb imitator for several reasons. In India, the problem of finding affordable accommodations is massive. The challenge is not discoverability, which is what startups like Airbnb address. Rather it is the lack of predictability in hotel stay experiences that Agarwal is tackling. Travelers are all too familiar with nightmarish encounters in standalone hotels in India. Contrary to promises, guests arrive to ramshackle buildings, missing signage, leaky washrooms, torn mattresses, unclean floors, sputtering air-conditioning, non-acceptance of credit cards and so on.\n“No Indian traveler deserves to stay in those kinds of places, no matter what he pays. It is this trust deficiency that OYO is trying to combat,” says Ritesh Agarwal who says the potential for branded hotels is huge. About 415 million Indians undertake a journey every year, he says.\nSo, quite like the predictably timely service offered by Uber, OYO hotels pledge to provide standardization on 30 measures in each room including free wifi and breakfast, flatscreen TVs, spotless white bed linen of a certain thread count, branded toiletries, 6-inch shower heads, a beverage tray and so on. The standards are audited every few days so that every customer is assured a quality experience. OYO’s budget stays range from 999 rupees (about$16) to 1,500 rupees ($25) while its midscale rooms are priced at 1,600 ($26) to 4,000 rupees ($66). OYO helps asset owners by providing them vendors with quality supplies as well as service training.\nAgarwal, a college dropout and the first Asian to graduate as a Thiel Fellow (the Thiel Fellowship backed by PayPal founder Peter Thiel requires its Fellows to drop out of school) says his is an original business model. “We are not building an Indian alternative to what has been attempted in the Silicon Valley or China.”\nRitesh Agarwal, founder of OYO Rooms (Image: OYO)\nIndia’s affordable travel segment is suddenly afire with a flurry of investment deals in players like OYO. For instance, Bangalore-based hotel marketplace Treebo, started up by three founders including two former McKinsey executives just three months ago, received $ 6 million in venture capital from investors including Matrix Partners and SAIF Partners . Budget hotel, homestay and guest house aggregator StayZilla raised $20 million from Nexus Venture Partners and Matrix Partners. This month, low-end hotel marketplace ZO Rooms received $30 million from Tiger Global among others.\nTreebo’s co-founder Sidharth Gupta says the supply in India’s unorganized hotel sector (unbranded, standalone hotels) is an estimated million rooms. While many travel portals aggregate and provide the convenience of online booking, they have not solved the problem of quality assurance. “We offer clean and fresh rooms and a 30-minute service guarantee for any irritants,” says Gupta whose brand will aggregate 21 hotels in four cities by this month end, and is ramping up rapidly. He estimates the hotel market potential at $10 billion. “When guests get access to the dignified accommodation they deserve without having to burn a hole in their pocket, it will unlock a new set of travelers,” says Gupta.\nIndia is a large market, geographically, as well as a diverse market. As Indians’ spend basket grows, demand for hotel accommodation is surging like never before. “In smaller towns, people check into OYO hotels when power supply goes down at home as our hotels guarantee air-conditioning, younger Indians check in to budget hotels because they don’t want to go home drunk (to their parents). There are ever-increasing types of hotel consumption in India” says Kavikrut (who goes by a single name), head of expansion at OYO. Demand spikes when cities host cricket matches, for instance.\nData science is at the heart of the operations at OYO which started with one hotel in Gurgaon, in the suburbs of India’s capital New Delhi, which is also its base. All transactions at its hotels, such as check-ins, check-outs, audits of the toiletries in the room, are done through its app loaded on a tablet. The app also enables a single-click reconciliation at the end of the month with over 600 variables (such as check payment, cash, corporate rate and so on). Scientific algorithms decide pricing. Data science helps highlight areas with high demand. This month the startup will book 400,000 room nights.\nOYO’s early investors include Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed India and Greenoaks Capital. Growth is fast paced and OYO added 43 cities in July and will add another 50 cities this month. Kavikrut says the OYO brand will offer 50,000 rooms in 200 cities by the year-end and grow to 500,000 in the next two to three years.\nOYO and its competitors like Treebo are using technology, training and standardized supplies to provide a predictable hotel stay experience in India (Image: OYO)\nComment below, email or tweet @SarithaRai", "external_links": ["https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQqQIoADABahUKEwjpzJrX45PHAhWVkI4KHQNnDmo&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimesofindia.indiatimes.com%2Ftech%2Ftech-news%2FMatrix-SAIF-fund-former-Myntra-executives-Treebo%2Farticleshow%2F47777988.cms&ei=4vfCVenTCZWhugSDzrnQBg&usg=AFQjCNGwnXrXOPLUQR_eSQrt_wimVO4S6Q&bvm=bv.99556055,d.c2E", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/SoftBank-leads-Rs-630cr-funding-in-Oyo-Rooms/articleshow/48337966.cms", "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/zo-rooms-raises-fresh-funding-of-rs-192-crore-from-tiger-global-orios-venture/articleshow/48352170.cms", "http://www.thielfellowship.org/"], "published": "2015-08-06T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:37:26.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
