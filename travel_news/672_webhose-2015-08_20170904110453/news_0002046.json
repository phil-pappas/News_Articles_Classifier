(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File) One of the items on the list was chicken fries, which Burger King sold between 2005 and 2012.\nA few months later, Hirschhorn says there was an even bigger surge when a One Direction member mentioned them. The company pointed to a tweet by Liam Payne that reads, \"I'm so fu !!! Think I just ate my body weight in chicken fries and sides o .\"\nThe tweet, which has more than 94,000 retweets, is confusing because Burger King hadn't yet brought back chicken fries. That raises the possibility that Payne just left out a comma, and meant to say he ate chicken and fries â€” not chicken fries.\nChicken fries and a soft drink are posed for a photo at a Burger King restaurant, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015, in Orlando, Fla.

That tweet included an image of Colonel Sanders and the words \"the kernel god bless you and your original recipe.\"\nA representative for Payne said the singer wasn't available for comment. A Burger King representative said in an email: \"Whatever he meant, it certainly helped catapult 'Chicken Fries' into pop culture consciousness as a follow up to the Buzzfeed story.\"\nEven if Burger King misinterpreted Payne's tweet, it worked out for the company. The return of chicken fries as a limited-time offer last summer was successful enough that Burger King added them to its permanent menu this March. A nine-piece box costs around $3.\nChicken fries and a soft drink are posed for a photo at a Burger King restaurant, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015, in Orlando, Fla.

Last month, Burger King's parent company Restaurant Brands International said sales rose 7.9 percent at established stores in the U.S. and Canada for the latest quarter.\nBurger King may have brought back chicken fries even without the social media encouragement.\nSince being taken over by investment firm 3G Capital, the chain has leaned heavily on its past for ideas. In addition the King and Subservient Chicken characters, it has resurrected its Big King sandwich and Yumbo ham sandwich.\nChicken fries are posed for a photo at a Burger King restaurant, Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015, in Orlando, Fla.
