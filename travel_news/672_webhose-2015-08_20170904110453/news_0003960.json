In fact, focusing more on domestic destinations will help boost the segment which has suffered a drop in sales over the past few months,” he told reporters when announcing the Matta Fair 2015 which is scheduled in September, in Kuala Lumpur Monday (Aug 17).\nMeanwhile, Tourism Malaysia Domestic Tourism Marketing Director Iskandar Mirza Mohd Yusof said the total number of domestic tourists increased by 11.6 per cent to 60.7 million in 2014, compared to 54.4 million in 2013.\n“Themed ‘Cuti-cuti 1Malaysia: Dekat Je’, we hope to increase the figure to 63.7 million domestic tourists for this year. Boosting the domestic tourism industry will create new investments in domestic destinations, thus increasing the number of domestic tourists, and of course it will also create job opportunities for the locals,” Iskandar Mirza said.\nPhua said through the Matta Fair, to be held at the Putra World Trade Centre (PWTC) here from Sept 4 to 6, featuring 1,233 booths, RM4.5 million in total sales of domestic tourism products has been targetted for the three-day fair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:37:46.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
