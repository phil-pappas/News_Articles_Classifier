That is the striking finding of exclusive research carried out for IMEX America by Meeting Professionals International (MPI) as part of its Meetings Outlook ™ survey. IMEX America will take place 13 – 15 October at the Sands Expo and Convention Center at The Venetian® | The Palazzo® Las Vegas. \nMPI members were asked: “During North America Meetings Industry Day and IMEX America 2014 Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP, said ‘I've witnessed how conferences, seminars and meetings yield tremendous value for companies.’ How much would your CEO or your clients' CEO's -- or C-Suite -- agree with this statement? ” 33.2 per cent of 327 respondents said that the CEO or C- Suite would strongly agree with the opinion, 47.8 per cent would agree and 14.6 per cent would slightly agree, making a total of 95.6 per cent agreeing to some degree and just 4.4 per cent disagreeing. Carina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group, commented: “This result is very encouraging for the meetings industry worldwide. While many people in the industry have increasingly sensed supportive attitudes, we are pleasantly surprised by these positive results, especially as they are credible representing the opinions of senior industry buyers and suppliers who are well placed to assess the views of Board level directors.” “It seems that all the hard work that has been invested into demonstrating the value of meetings has started to gain recognition at the top of the corporate world.” At the same time, the IMEX Group has just released on its website highlights of Bill McDermott’s impressive keynote speech at the opening ceremony of IMEX in Frankfurt 2015. His positive view of the benefits of meetings included “Meetings matter; you have to celebrate the victories, reinvent the business and inspire the people.\" Related articles World Travel Awards signs Avianca as Official Airline Partner for Latin America Gala Ceremony 2015 World Travel Awards has announced Avianca as the Official Airline Partner for the upcoming Latin America Gala Ceremony 2015.
