According to the Federal Statistics Office, this increase was facilitated by domestic as well as foreign tourists. \nThe growing trend can mainly be derived from the increasing number of domestic overnight stays (plus 3 percent in the first half-year of 2015 compared to 2014), as written by market research company MGK Hospitality in a PR statement. \nDomestic tourists make up more than 75 percent of all overnight stays within Germany. The number of overnight stays booked by international guests increased by 5 percent in 2015. According to MGK Hospitality, this trend is a result of the generally positive dynamics seen in Germany and the resulting goal of more than 80 million overnight stays until 2020. \nIn the first six months of 2015, the RevPAR (Revenue per available room) increased by 6 percent. This higher revenue can be explained by a higher demand (plus 1.6 percent) and the increasing average rates (plus 3.6 percent). However, this phenomenon is something which can be seen in other parts of Europe more often than in Germany. \nThe newly introduced minimum wage and the restrictions imposed on mini jobs, which increase costs in this sector, led to a general average price increase. An examination carried out by the University of Heilbronn showed that this equals 2 percent of revenue in the hotel industry and 3 percent in the restaurant industry. \nCompared to previous year, June saw a strong increase in hotel revenue of 4.6 percent, with lodging and catering displaying the biggest revenue increases. According to the Federal Statistics Office, in 2015 the German hotel businesses made 4.6 real percent and 7.4 nominal percent more than in June of 2014. Compared to the previous month and seasonally adjusted, the revenue made in June was 1.2 real percent and 1.6 nominal percent higher. \nLodging alone achieved 6.7 real and 9.4 nominal percent higher revenues than in June of 2014. The revenue made by the catering industry in June 2015 was 3.1 real and 6.0 nominal percent higher than the year before. Within the catering industry, the revenue of caterers was 6.8 real and 8.9 nominal percent higher than previous year. \nGerman Hospitality Sales: 1st half 2015 compared to first half 2014 (change in %) \nBusiness area nominal real", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T20:41:03.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
