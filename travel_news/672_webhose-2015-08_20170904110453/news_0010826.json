Emilie Groleau \nEmilie replaces Peter Power, who has successfully held the position since February, 2014. Unfortunately, Peter sustained serious injuries in a car accident several months ago and due to the ongoing medical care required, he is unable to continue his responsibilities as General Manager for AVIAREPS Oceania.

She is a determined and goal-oriented manager with a strong focus on improving performance in the space of destination and airline marketing Before joining AVIAREPS, Emilie held management, communications and consulting positions with a variety of organisations such as the United Nations, New York University, and Sustainable Travel International. Thanks to 10 years of international assignments in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, Emilie has developed a wide network in the global tourism industry and in-depth knowledge of how to motivate both the travel trade and consumer segments. She brings to the Australian office a rare depth of international tourism experience, and a passion for innovation. A Canadian national, Emilie holds a Master’s Degree in Tourism Management and Development from New York University. \n“I look forward to representing and supporting travel companies in the Australian and New Zealand markets,” said Emilie. “I also thank Peter for his dedicated work and wish him well in his recovery.” \nCommenting on the announcement, Peter said: “I am very confident that Emilie will achieve great things as the GM for AVIAREPS and am now comfortable to hand over the role into her capable hands. I also thank the industry for its support before and after my accident. It means a lot.” \nEmilie can be contacted via email – <mailto: [email protected] > [email protected] – or phone on 0414 322 466. \nFounded in Germany in 1994 and boasting an extensive office network spanning six continents with 58 offices in 43 countries, the AVIAREPS Group is the world’s leading airline and tourism management company with over 100 airlines and more than 150 tourism clients in its portfolio.
