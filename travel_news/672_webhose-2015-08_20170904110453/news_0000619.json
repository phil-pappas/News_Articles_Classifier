In spite of all our population and pollution issues, it looks like some of us are still doing something right! Even though, our cities are turning into concrete jungles, a lot many tourism initiatives in the country are geared towards eco tourism. What saddens me a lot is the fact that a lot of pristine holiday destinations that I visited a decade back has turned into a concrete dump filled with garbage and ill-planned architecture. And that is where sustainable travel or what we call eco tourism comes in! It is not just the destination or hotel properties that play a role in sustainable tourism, but us travelers too play a pivotal role in ensuring these holiday destinations survive for our future generations to enjoy. And it all starts with plastic water bottles and other trash that we generate. I love to travel, but am also aware of the damage that a huge travel population can do to the eco system. And that is why I am a bit believer in sustainable travel and eco tourism. I follow it in my own simple way! Do you? Recently, Green Pearls, a sustainable tourism company interviewed me and hotelier Goerge Dominic on Sustainable Tourism in India and how Eco Tourism is blossoming in our country. In this interview, we talk about the role sustainable tourism is currently playing in India, why sustainable tourism is essential, why we should as travelers think sustainable travel, my dreams in sustainable travel, three great eco friendly hotels in India, our cultural responsibility and much more.
