Set on the north bank of the fast-moving creek from which it takes its name, this classy little gem near Mankato looks like it could have been plucked right out of Sonoma or Napa counties in northern California.\nBetter yet, the winery — whose name means \"enclosed forest\" in the Dakota language — has the chops to back it up, winning multiple awards at international wine competitions in New York and California.\nAnd earlier this year, it was dubbed the best winery in the Gopher State by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, which opined that Chankaska Creek's white wines are \"expressive and darn tasty, and the robust, delicious Marquette Reserve is not only worth its $34 price tag, but might be a bargain.\"\nBut perhaps the best thing about the winery — at least from this traveler's perspective — are the beautiful grounds that feature 11 acres of vineyards, gardens and a cozy tasting room and deck, where visitors can sample wines and dine on pizzas, cheeses, olives, flatbreads, salads and other delicious offerings.\nIt also hosts music concerts and more than 15 weddings annually.\nWhen I visited recently with my family, we were lucky enough to get a tour from winery owner Kent Schwickert.\nSchwickert, a businessman who played college baseball for the University of Minnesota in the early '80s, said he has long had a passion for the wine industry and bought the 25 acres on which he built Chankaska Creek (also home to a micro-distillery that makes whiskey, brandy and gin) in 2008. The winery's general manager is Jane Schwickert, Kent's spouse. Together, they've visited more than 100 wineries around the globe.\n\"As a collector of wine, I got more and more into it,\" he said. \"Once I learned about the laws in Minnesota governing wine and liquor, I knew I wanted to open a place like this. Minnesota has something that is unique with its 'farm winery' rule, which allows you to produce and sell wine on your property if you make less than 50,000 gallons a year.\"\nThe majority of the grapes used in Chankaska Creek wines come from Minnesota, but that fruit is also blended with grapes from California and Washington State to make the finished product.\nThe winery is relatively new, Schwickert said, with the vineyard planted only six years ago. There are 10 varietals in the vineyard, all cold-weather hybrids developed at the University of Minnesota. This is the first year the winery's 5,500 vines will be in full production, following a particularly harsh winter in 2014 with what he called \"deep, deep\" cold and temperatures dropping to minus 16 and lower.\nSchwickert said his acquaintances were more than a little surprised when he said he wanted to start a winery.\n\"Frankly, they thought I'd had a frontal lobotomy,\" he said with a laugh. \"My brother lives in Montana and is an investor. He said he was really excited that he would get to tell people that he was backing a winery. When he said it was in Minnesota, they'd look at him, shake their heads and try to change the subject — until they tried the wine and found out how good it is.\n\"My vision is simply 'let's make good wine.' If I don't like it, out it goes. So, you have to have the right equipment, and that means climate-controlled tanks and filtration systems.\n\"We also have a top winemaker in Mike Drash, who came from Napa and has decades of experience. His wife is from Wisconsin, and they wanted to be near family.\"\nSchwickert said the winery is entering the (Champagne-like) sparkling wine arena this year, with its first production coming this fall.\nHe said Josie Boyle, the Chankaska assistant winemaker, used to work for the L. Mawby Vineyards on Michigan's Leelanau Peninsula, which is known for its sparkling wines.\nIn addition, Schwickert said he is particularly proud of the winery's North Forest Valnot Krem, which won a gold medal and Best of Class at the 2015 Riverside International Wine Competition in California and a double gold medal at the 2015 Finger Lakes Wine Competition in New York.\nThe tasty concoction uses maple syrup and black walnuts from Mankato, the winery's own apple brandy and a dash of Minnesota apple wine mixed with fresh cream.\nSchwickert said Valnot Krem, which means walnut cream in Swedish, tastes like a stack of warm, buttered pancakes covered in fresh maple syrup, sprinkled with walnuts and topped with homemade cream.\nHe also advises drinking it straight up, with a couple of ice cubes, or in coffee.\nIn the tasting room, my wife and I tried several wines and then watched a chef prepare antipasto dishes and a scrumptious-looking pizza. We also wandered the well-kept grounds and discovered the Chankaska Forest and a small meadow beside the rushing creek, which is home to sculptures of two dancing colts.\nBut our short trip to Mankato and St. Peter wasn't entirely limited to the Chankaska winery. We also had a nice dinner (the salmon dish was the best) in downtown Mankato's Pub 500 , ate ice cream at Mom & Pop's and saw some cool public artwork. In St. Peter, we had a tasty lunch at Patrick's on Third .\nMore information: Free tours of the Chankaska Creek Ranch & Winery are offered at 1 and 3 p.m. on Saturdays and 2 and 4 p.m. on Sundays from May through September.
