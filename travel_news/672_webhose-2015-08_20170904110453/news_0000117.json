There is a real danger of uncontrollable situations. Blood will be shed.” \nHe also called for the Greek authorities to do more to help move migrants off the island as well as help police the ones already there. \nKyritsis said: “How many illegal immigrants can Kos cope with? How many can Greece cope with?” \nThe United Nations refugee organisation UNHCR has criticised the treatment of migrants on the island, adding as many as 3,000 may still be waiting to be registered by the authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T17:10:34.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
