Mobile wireless check-in desks have also been introduced to provide flexible passenger processing, so at peak periods when alternative check-in locations are required, staff can simply bring the technology to the passenger.\nThe new FIDs are displayed on brand new LCD screens and, thanks to a new content management system, have the flexibility to control what information is presented. At the touch of a button, they can display new information including way finding, flight status, and disruption messaging, further enhancing communication with passengers.\nA total of 89 are set to be installed along with ‘smartwall’ screens which in total are bigger than those found in IMAX cinemas, designed to support check-in operations.\nNew technology is also being developed in the airport to provide a greater view of the number of passengers travelling and a better understanding of both check-in procedures and dwell times. Data is studied and then improvements can be made accordingly – for example, changing passenger queuing locations to make the most of LCY’s limited terminal space.\nAlison FitzGerald, Chief Information Officer, said: “This new technology is a timely introduction with the summer season upon us. We have already set record passenger numbers more than once this year and we are on course to welcome 4.1 million passengers in 2015, up from 3.65 million in 2014.\n“We have already introduced free and fast Wi-Fi, improved seating featuring power points for passengers to charge phones and other devices, and the new kiosks, wireless check-in desks, and FIDs will all help us to meet the increasing demand we are facing and provide our customers with the high quality level of service they have come to expect from us.”\nSource:- London City Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:22:56.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
