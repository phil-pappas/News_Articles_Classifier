Some estimates put it at around 25 million. \n\"If the data we have so far is accurate and continues to show this positive trend, Greek tourism will have a positive season for 2015 in relation to previous years,\" Kountoura said. \nFrom queues for ferries at Piraeus port to crowds milling at the changing of the pom-pommed, skirted guard at the Greek parliament in Athens, anecdotal evidence would also appear to suggest boom time. \nThis would be a much-needed boost for the economy, albeit one offset by an expected slump in domestic tourism as cash-strapped Greeks stay at home. \nSome places less popular with visitors abroad are having a tough time of it. But there is little sign of hesitancy among foreigners, some of whom also benefit from a weaker euro. \nThe foreign visitors are not directly affected by Greece's debt crisis, the poverty provoked by austerity, a jobless rate of roughly 26 percent and the capital controls imposed on banks that limit Greeks to 60 euros of cash a day. \nSome, though, are aware of the crisis and say they are happy their visiting is helping out. \nStanding next to the 11th century Orthodox church of Kapnikarea, in Athens's Monastiraki district, Claire Murray from Lancashire, England, said she and her husband were coming to Greece twice on holiday this year, in part to give support. \n\"We like it. It is a lovely place,\" she said. \"(We thought) why not spend our money here. We love the people.\" Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
