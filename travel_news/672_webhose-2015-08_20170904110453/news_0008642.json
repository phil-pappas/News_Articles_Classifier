Hosted in collaboration with the popular brand ‘ghd – good hair day, every day’, the workshop attracted several young girls looking to experiment with a new hairstyle.\nRasheed Haidar, one of the stylists, said, “The aim behind the workshop is to provide children with hours of fun during their on-going summer vacation and to give them a chance to try out different hairstyles using ghd products, which are gentle on hair and offer excellent protection.”\n“Having a hair makeover workshop for kids is a new concept. Many girls have naturally showed a lot of interest in the hair makeovers, but we also got a couple of requests from boys who asked us to change their hairstyle. We have responded to all the requests and provided hairstyling services free-of-charge to every visitor. We have seen great response from The Dubai Mall shoppers and passersby are admiring the concept. During the morning hours itself, we received around 50 kids and we expect that this number will double during the evening.”\nZain Al Almy, an 11-year-old girl from Jordan, said, “I saw the workshop by coincidence while I was at The Dubai Mall and I was attracted by the different hairstyles that the stylists were creating. For that reason I decided to try it myself and I love my new hairstyle now.”\nNada Al Almy, Zain’s 12-year-old cousin, said, “I came from Sharjah to have a good time at The Dubai Mall and I have enjoyed my time indeed as my hair turned out to be beautiful after I had it styled by professional hairdressers. I cannot express how happy I am today.”\n10-year-old Fatmah Mohammed from the UAE, said, “The workshop instantly grabbed my attention and I decided to try the makeover especially since children don’t always get this opportunity. It came to my notice that this was a surprise treat for kids organised as part of the on-going DSS celebrations. I am very happy with the results.”\nIn addition to the “Hairstyling for Teenagers” workshop, the “Make your own Perfume” workshop set up opposite Galeries Lafayette store also witnessed a huge turnout of children as kids created their own fragrances and took them as special souvenirs of Dubai Summer Surprises celebrations.\nDina Shalaby, who is one of the supervisors at the workshop, said: “There is a huge demand among kids to create their own perfumes. During the morning hours alone, we have received more than 80 children. They were all able to make their own unique fragrances, which are free from alcohol.”\nShalaby added, “It is a very simple workshop but offers children a lot of fun. As parents go shopping, children come here to have a great time.”\n12-year-old Maytha Naser from the UAE, said, “I really enjoyed making my own fragrance. I have combined the flower and apple fragrances – the result was amazing. I was even more excited when I found out that I can keep the perfume for myself.”\nHer 8-year-old sister Maha, said, “I have created a perfume similar to what my sister has made. It is a beautiful fragrance and I will take it home with me to wear it every day.”\n10-year-old Asmaa Suhail from Pakistan, said: “I really like the smell of flowers and my sisters Heba, Abeer and Aisha, share the same taste. So we all agreed to create a perfume with a flower fragrance and I will keep it with me as a memory from DSS and Kids Fashion Fest.”\nThe Kids Fashion Fest workshops at The Dubai Mall will run daily till August 22, 2015 in collaboration with a number of various participating brands including Bloomingdale’s – Dubai – Magnolia Bakery, Armani Junior, Galeries Lafayette, Gingersnaps, Petit Bateau, Sacoor Kids, Marimekko, Reebok and ghd – good hair day, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:30:09.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
