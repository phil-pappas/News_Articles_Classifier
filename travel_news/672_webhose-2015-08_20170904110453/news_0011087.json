There, they throw tomatoes, get messy, and clean off in the river. It's a quaint village festival that's supposed to show the quirky character of the locals. \nThat's probably why it was selected as a Google Doodle. \nSo, Buñol isn’t the only place being pelted with tomatoes. Today’s Google Doodle has joined in on the act to celebrate the 70th anniversary of what is widely considered the world’s largest food fight. \nToday's Google Doodle, created by Nate Swinehart, features an animated depiction of the revelry that about 50,000 people are expected to engage in on Wednesday — including the ham hoisted on top of a pole that must traditionally be untied and brought down before a single tomato can be thrown. \nBut because we cannot squash tomatoes and throw them to mark 70 years of this messy, quirky festival, we bring you 21 of the greatest splats from the last couple of years in these pictures. \n(AP, AFP, Twitter Photos)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:36:04.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
