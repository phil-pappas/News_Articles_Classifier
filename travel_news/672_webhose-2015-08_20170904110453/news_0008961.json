As one of the leading golf facility Management Company, Troon’s flagship properties, Lumine has gone from strength-to-strength since its acclaimed hosting of the 2013 edition of the industry’s foremost travel show.\nDelegates at the show are encouraged to visit the Lumine Golf & Beach Club stand A004 to find out more about the Spanish resort and its all-encompassing golf, leisure and cultural offering that has seen it attract record numbers of golfers over the past few years.\nIn Tenerife, IGTM will once again offer the opportunity for the golf travel market to gather and network over a period of three days. It promises to be another successful show for Lumine and will round off a stellar 2015 season which has already seen the Troon-managed resort announce record revenues for the period January – June.\nLumine Golf and Beach Club’s General Manager Calle Carlsson said, “Following on from the success of hosting IGTM in 2013 we certainly built on the momentum of having the world’s eyes opened to our magnificent offering that includes 45-holes of championship golf, two clubhouses serving first-class cuisine as well as our magnificent Lumine Beach Club & Restaurant which provide something for everyone in the summer months.”\n“Myself and my team will be at IGTM all week and I welcome anyone to come and find out more about how we can work with them and deliver memorable golf experiences to visitors from all around the globe. We pride ourselves on the broad range of nationalities that visit Lumine and believe this diversity has helped hone our already impeccable service levels.”\nLocated a short distance from two international major airports, just one hour south of Barcelona, Lumine Golf and Beach Club is not only ideally situated, but also boasts a perfect environment for golfers of all abilities across its 45-holes, 27 of which were designed by Australian golfing great, Greg Norman and extensive practice facilities. This together with Lumine’s luxury Beach Club, fine dining and array of accommodation options nearby only serves to enhance the appeal of Lumine Golf & Beach Club to a broad range of nationalities and age ranges.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T07:59:15.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
