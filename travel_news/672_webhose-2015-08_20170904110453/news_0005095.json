Add to that good roads, plenty of transportation options, low cost, short distances, and you have no reason to skip this place. I was travelling solo on a budget with little time and still managed to see a lot. Below is some information that might help other like-minded travellers in the future. I spent about 3,500 INR for 5 days of travel in this state. Aizawl - Agartala I was in Aizawl, Mizoram planning on going to Agartal, Tripura and was looking to find a way apart from the usual route of going up to Silchar and back down. I read a post about someone taking a “shortcut” via Kanhmun and decided to try this route inspite of the previous “shortcut” from Manipur to Aizawl via CCPur that turned out to be more than I had bargained for. Arrived in Aizawl around 1:30 PM after a long journey from Lunglei and asked my new found friends where I could find this sumo stand which turned out to be in the Temple Square area. I had to make the call between a seat in the last row for the 6:30 PM sumo the same day, or a seat in the front row for the 6:30 AM the next day. Being one to always try and save time and money, I chose the night option which cost 850 INR. We left an hour or so late and with heavy rain the previous two days, it didn’t take long to start running into muddy roads. Unfortunately our driver was inexperienced and in command of a sumo that had quite bald tires which made things interesting at times. The road was pretty bad, but having seen worse on the previous trip I wasn’t complaining too much. And then it happened, a déjà vu moment when the sumo stopped and the word ‘stuck’ was uttered. Luckily there was quite a long line of people also stuck so we had safety in numbers in the middle of the jungle. After walking up the line of stopped vehicles, the culprit turned out to be a Sumo that was tilted at almost a 45 degree angle after its tires fell into a pit while letting an oncoming truck pass in the narrow and muddy road. After several failed attempts to push it loose, a truck driver came to the rescue with some iron chain and they were finally able to pull him out. After filling in the hole to prevent others from sharing the same fate, we slowly got back on track. All of this excitement and the bumpy roads meant little in terms of sleep for the night, but the morning rewarded us with beautiful views that seemed to almost make it worth the trip. We finally made it into Agartala around 3 pm and I checked into Hotel Welcome Palace for 200 INR. The higher cost rooms seemed ok, but overall a pretty seedy place and not recommended. Agartala itself was completely different than Aizawl with so much traffic, honking, and regular Indian madness that my initial impressions weren’t that good. Had to wait around an hour for the rains to subside after which I made my way towards the Ujayanta palace museum. At 10 INR, it was a pretty nominal fee and the museum actually had some good displays and I got to make a list of places I wanted to visit in Tripura based on the exhibits. My choices for other places to visit in Agartala were quite few and after checking out a temple and a mosque, I walked around the evening markets and then called it a night. I woke up early the next morning with the plan of heading towards the Temple of Fourteen Gods someone told me about. I took a share auto for 10 INR towards Khayerpur and then walked to the temple only to find out it didn’t open till 10 am. With 3 hours to go, I decided to skip it and headed back. There didn’t seem to be many other places to check out apart from a couple parks I wasn’t interested in and some buildings so I decided to leave towards the Sephajila zoo instead. Sephajila - Melaghar 10 INR bought a share auto ride to Nagarjala, and from there I found a share taxi for 30 INR that would drop me off at Sephajila.This zoo is it is inside a wilderness zone and you have to buy a ticket at the entrance to the wilderness zone (10 INR + 20 INR for camera), and then another at the zoo for the same cost. The 4.5 km walk was quite nice and would have been better if it wasn’t so hot. After walking through a lot of rubber plantations, I was greeted by a troop of monkeys before reaching the entrance to the zoo. Right when I got there, there was a crowd of people trying to offload two leopards from the truck to a new enclosure. I spent almost 30 minutes just watching this whole process unfold before proceeding to check out the rest of the zoo. The zoo wasn’t bad with a fair selection of animals and most seemed to be in good health. I liked the lion enclosure which seemed to simulate a forest environment, but also made it impossible to spot. My favorite animal was the hoolock gibbon since this was the first time I had seen and heard one and the sounds it made were insane and made me feel sad about his small enclosure that he seemed to hate. The clouded leopards were also quite an amazing sight to take in especially with them chilling on top of trees. Unfortunately, the zoo seems to think that simply posting warning signs is enough to make people not tease and provoke the animals. They are living in a dream world because every other visitor was making noises at the animals, and throwing small pebbles at them to try and get them to move and react. Complaining to the staff did nothing, so I decided to move on. The helpful people at the ticket counter flagged down my onward transport to Melaghar for 30 INR. I got dropped off and then walked a couple kilometers to the lake entrance where the Neer Mahal is located. The fee structure for the boat is such that you need at least 10 people to get the cheapest price. I almost gave up thinking nobody else would come during this off-season time, but after 30 minutes people started showing up and we had exactly 10 which dropped the price to just 25 INR for a round trip boat ride to the palace and back. I honestly wished I hadn’t made the effort to come all this way to see this sight. Almost 3/4th of it is under construction and you could only visit one section. It took me all of 2 minutes to tour it and then wait another 5 minutes for the rest of the group to also come back disappointed. Oh well, at least I got to go on a boat. Udaipur - Pilak I walked to the local taxi stand and caught a share taxi heading to Udaipur for 40 INR. From there I took a share auto for 10 INR towards the Matabari temple which is highly revered by the locals and outsiders. It was quite a small complex and I found myself spending more time being entertained at the nearby temple pond where massive turtles and fish would swim up to the banks and let people hand feed them and touch them. It was a pretty cool sight, but unfortunately my memory card got corrupted and I lost all these pictures and videos so if someone else has a few they would like to share with me that would be great! Upon returning to Udaipur, I learnt there was a bandh the next two days so I decided to retire early and found Hotel Sukanta for 200 INR. The place was ok, but the owner wasn’t the best so I would recommend avoiding it if you can. The next morning I had a late started towards Pilak. There wasn’t good information on how to get here, so I first took a share taxi to Shantibazar for 40 INR and then learnt I actually needed to get to Jolabari for the ruins and that cost an additional 20 INR. Locals weren’t helpful in trying to find the ruins, so I went towards the tourist lodge and met the person in charge who was super helpful. He wanted to organize the tour of the 4 or 5 ruins by auto, and I had to try real hard to convince him that I could walk there by myself. Using google maps, find Jolabari and the tourist lodge which is listed there, and you will see two long roads that head west. Take the second road and that will lead towards 3 of the main sites. I wasn’t keeping track of time and distance, but if I had to guess I’d say it was maybe 5 km in total to get to the furthest site. The excavation sites are quite small, but interesting because some contain Hindu sculptures and others contain Bhuddist sculptures. I liked the shyam sundar site the most due to some of the intricate carvings found there. The other site Thakurani Tilla had very old sculptures including a big one of the god Surya and a quartz Shivlinga. I then made my way back to Udaipur to visit some of the nearby temples. You have to ask locals for directions, but the ones that are easy to get to ones are Gunbati, Mahadev Badi, and Bhuvaneshwar. Chabbimura - Unakoti - Shillong From Pilak I could not find the revered Buddhist temple and I decided against heading to the Trishna wildlife sanctuary further south of Pilak. Also chose to skip going west to check out Boxanagar which is hailed to be a large Buddhist excavation site, and instead go east towards Chabbimura which I found fascinating based on the descriptions I read online. I started with a share taxi to Amarpur for 20 INR and then went to the tourist lodge. The owner here was also very friendly. Unfortunately for me, being monsoon season meant only the more expensive motor boats could navigate the river, and being off-season meant nobody else was planning on making the same trip. I decided against walking the 9 km to the town and then spending 2,000 INR for the boat trip. I think I regret that decision a bit now and should have just gone for it. Oh well, at least I got to check out the nearby local ponds. From Amarpur I decided to make my way to the Unakoti carvings. To save time, I decided against backtracking to Udaipur and instead took a share taxi first to Teliamura for 40 INR, then to Kumarghat for 130 INR, and then finally to Kailasahar for 30 INR. Kailasahar was actually a nice little border town. Here I stayed at Shree Krishna which was quite a fine place for the price of 200 INR. The markets were busy in the evening and it was interesting to see the electric rickshaws dominating this part of the country. In the morning I took a share taxi to Unakoti and since they all originate from here, I had to pay 30 INR for the trip. Unakoti was amazing. It was more than I expected and made my jaw drop. I spent quite a while there walking through the herd paths and following the small river streams up and down. It is definitely worth the visit. Only part I didn’t like was the Archeological Survey of India assuming a simple sign would stop people from writing on the sculptures when they are out there with no barriers or protection. I wish they would put more effort into preserving these ancient and unique sculptures before they all end up being filled with idiots intent on writing their names…for what purpose I don’t know. From Unakoti I had to wait a bit since most share transport originates from nearby Kailasahar and nobody gets off, but eventually I hailed one with an empty seat that took me to Dharmanagar for 30 INR. It was a bandh over there as well so I decided to take the night bus to Shillong for 530 INR. I don't know if there was a diversion or if we took the regular route, but till Silchar the roads were terrible and I was unlucky enough to get a seat in the last row. Oh well, at least I got to experience micro seconds of weightlessness each time I got thrown off my seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:59:25.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
