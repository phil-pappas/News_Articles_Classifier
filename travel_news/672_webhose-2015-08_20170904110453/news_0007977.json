Photo: Alamy Comments \nI write this from a gloriously sunny, gloriously rainy hamlet on the Pembrokeshire coast, where we are holidaying this year. \nWe have been drawn not by guarantees of travel brochure sunshine, but by the lure of folded green hillscapes, hidden wooded gulleys, restless waves churning and spuming at the foot of the cliffs. \nThe lush British countryside has a bracing, primal beauty that taps into us. Defines us. And moves a great many of us to compose fabulously awful verse in visitors’ books from Thurso to Theberton. \nThere’s something about changeable weather, pub lunches and local cheese that brings out Pooterish poetry in a way you simply don’t see in Tuscany or Aix-en-Provence. \nThe new Pembrokeshire Trail finishes at Amroth \nWith the exception of Byron , visitors to Greece don’t usually wax so lyrical. Nobody ever commemorated a fortnight Malaga in jaunty rhyming couplets. At least not repeatable ones. \nIt’s reassuring then, that the visitors' book in our house is chokka with the sort of epics – Homeric in sweep, heroic in scope – that are quite simply unheard of beyond these shores. \nLike local wines, they don’t really travel, but here, in their country – their county – of origin, they are impossible to resist. So how could I? \nAnd so, with apologies to (inter alia) Becky, Dave, Lucy, Oliver and Cassie the Spaniel (woof!!!)... \nThis magical place \nI must have a go \nI couldn’t be worse \nBut how to begin \nAnd which meter to use? \nWhere do I start?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T23:22:21.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
