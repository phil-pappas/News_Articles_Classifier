It's time to indulge your design dreams with a tour of an architect's retreat. Today we're taking a tour of Fallingwater, a one-of-a-kind house on a waterfall designed by America's most famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. \nImagine the Kaufmann family's surprise when they found out that their dream vacation home wouldn't be facing the waterfall of Bear Run Mountain in Pennsylvania as they had anticipated. Instead, American architect Frank Lloyd Wright chose to build the home over the waterfall, making it impossible to gaze straight on at the freefalling water. Impossible not to hear it though. In fact, the architect's vision was to have the Kaufmann family living among the cascades, making the water a part of their daily life. \nBy building the house on the waterfall instead of on terra firma, Frank Lloyd Wright earned his creation for the Kaufmanns the cover of Time magazine in January of 1938. \nThe main house spans 5,330 square feet (495 sq m) with 2,885 sq ft for the interior and 2,445 sq ft for the terraces, while the guest house uses 1,700 square feet (157 sq m). Wright's desire to create a unified and organic composition limited the color palette at Fallingwater, and only two colors were used throughout: a light ochre for the concrete and his signature Cherokee red for the steel. \nThe interior of Fallingwater, by renowed architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The house today has become a historical monument and has welcomed nearly 4.5 million visitors since it opened to the public in 1964. \nThe Kaufmanns were passionate about design and modern art, and so they turned to Frank Lloyd Wright, the champion of organic architecture, whose vision was to harmonize the home with the environment. The architect is also responsible for the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \nOwners of the Kaufmann chain of department stores, the family had envisioned a retreat for their employees, most of whom had been hit hard by the Great Depression. True lovers of nature, Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann, along with their son, continued to spend vacations in the house until it was donated in 1963 to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. ― AFP-Relaxnews More Stories for You:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:48:06.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
