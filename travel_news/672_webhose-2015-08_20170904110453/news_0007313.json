Likewise, it’s too late to plant most other overwintering cabbage-family crops such as broccoli and cauliflower.\nThe good news is that August is perfect timing to sow salad greens directly into the garden for fall harvest. Arugula, lettuce, gourmet mesclun blends, cilantro, mustards, oriental greens, radishes, beets (for leaves only) and spinach all germinate well in the cooler soil and should be ready to harvest in fall.\nGardening Events Ciscoe’s Picks: ‘Art in the Garden’ at Bellevue Botanical Garden: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and Sunday, Aug. 29 and 30.

Then make sure the soil in the planting area remains moist at all times until well after germination to be sure newly emerging seedlings don’t dry out, especially if we experience more hot weather into late summer and fall.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid With a little luck, at least some of these late-season greens should be ready to harvest by mid- to late-October.\nUsually greens sowed now will keep producing until a hard frost does them in, but you can extend the harvest by covering the greens with a cloche. Even if you don’t cover them, if we experience a mild winter, as long as you harvest by picking young, tender leaves as needed, you might find yourself eating salads right out of your garden all winter long.\nQ: Every night, something is eating large bites out of my juicy red tomatoes, even the ones at the top of my 5-foot plant. What animal is most likely doing this and how do I stop it from happening?\nA: As long as you’re sure the damage is happening at night, I suspect that rats are feasting on your tomatoes. Squirrels and chipmunks are capable of doing similar damage, but they usually forage during daylight hours.\nRats are very common in the Seattle area, and if large populations build up they can devastate a vegetable garden. As much as they love tomatoes, their culinary tastes extend to other veggies and they are capable of mowing down broccoli and cauliflower stalks, as well.\nMuch as I don’t like to kill any creature, I don’t know of any alternative when it comes to controlling rats. I don’t recommend using baits in a food garden, or where pets could become ill from catching a poisoned rat.\nIn my opinion, the best way to deal with a rat problem is to set up lots of rat traps in the area where they are doing the damage. I prefer the wood-based wire snap traps. They have a spike on the trigger that can be pushed down to hold the bait, or the bait can be stuck on the spike. A half-inch chunk of beef jerky held tightly under the trigger spike works extremely well with Norway rats; roof rats prefer peanuts stuck firmly on the spike.\nBoth kinds of rats are prevalent in our area, so set up a few traps for each. Rats are smart, so you need to use a few tricks to outwit them. Try scattering bits of jerky and a few peanuts in the garden so they get used to finding them. Another helpful tip is to put two or three drops of fish oil on the trap to disguise your scent.\nTo keep from harming squirrels, put the traps out only at night. To prevent cats or raccoons from getting at them, cover them with milk-carton crates, available online. The crates have holes in the sides that rats can enter, but will prevent bigger animals access, especially if you put a heavy stone on top of the crate to hold it in place.\nWhen you catch a rat, I recommend double bagging the trap without removing the rat, and throwing it in the garbage. I don’t know about you, but I’m not about to touch one of those critters!\nCiscoe Morris: ciscoe@ciscoe.com . “Gardening With Ciscoe” airs weekly on KING 5; check local listings.", "external_links": ["http://farmerfrog.org/events-2/", "http://artinthegardenbellevue.com/", "http://pugetsounddahlias.org/"], "published": "2015-08-20T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:17:54.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
