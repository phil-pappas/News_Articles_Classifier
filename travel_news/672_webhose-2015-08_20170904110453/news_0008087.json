Thailand is a popular destination for Australians, but is it safe? Source: Getty Images \nAUSTRALIANS are likely to return to Thailand despite persistent travel warnings and the latest targeted attack on one of Asia’s most popular tourist destinations. \nA bomb detonated at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok during the city’s evening rush-hour (about 9.30pm AEST) yesterday, killing at least 21 people, including foreign tourists, and injuring about 120. \nTerror expert Professor Greg Barton from Monash University said while no group had claimed responsibility for the attack, it was clear the blast was targeting tourists. \n“It had lethal intent, there’s no question,” he said. \nPhil Sylvester, travel safety specialist at Travel Insurance Direct (TID), said Australians would be reluctant to visit Thailand in the short term, but tourism would quickly recover. \n“Incidents like this always have an impact on the decision to travel to a country,” he said. “But that often doesn’t last long once people get a clear picture of the situation, and (understand) it’s a one-off. \n“Let’s hope that's true this time — further attacks would be a tragedy for the Thai people, not just those who want to visit.” \nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has not upgraded the country’s travel warning since the attack, with its Smart Traveller website still telling Australians to “exercise a high degree of caution” in Thailand. \nDFAT recommends against travelling to some parts of the country including Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and Songkhla.

It’s more likely this corner was chosen because it’s one of the most congested areas. It would be like having a bomb outside a major urban train station in Sydney or Melbourne, to cause maximum damage and affect the maximum number a of people.” The Erawan Shrine, pictured earlier this year, is a popular shrine to the Hindu god Brahma and is visited by Buddhist devotees daily.

According to figures released in June , 109 Australians died in Thailand and 150 were hospitalised from sickness or injury since July last year. \nDespite that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it’s the fifth most popular destination for Australian tourists , after New Zealand, Indonesia, the US and UK. \nMr Sylvester warned visitors to Thailand to always use a high degree of caution. \n“It may be wise to stay away from popular tourist drawcards such as temples and monuments for the moment, while authorities assess the risk of further attacks,” he said. \n“Check with hotel staff before you head out for the day, they’re usually across local news and events and will be able to advise you of the places it’s best to avoid. \nMr Sylvester also advised Australians in Thailand to let someone back home know your plans and to register with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade . \n“Make arrangements so that you can be contacted in an emergency — carry your phone,” he said. \nDFAT hotline within Australia: 1300 555 135 | Outside Australia: (61) 2 6261 3305 Attack on Terror 50:05 \nReveals the new breed of counter-terrorism weaponry now being deployed in cities worldwide.
