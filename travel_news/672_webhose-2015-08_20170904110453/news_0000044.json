The child became infected following a visit to Stanislaus National Forest and camping in Yosemite National Park.\nThe California case is the third reported plague patient in the past week, with two others diagnosed in Colorado, including one in Boulder, Colo., the first time the city has seen the disease in two decades.\nHow is it possible to contract the plague, known as the Black Death in the Dark Ages, in the modern day, particularly in an industrialized nation like the United States?\nPhotos: 12 Diseases That Just Won’t Quit\nAlthough modern medicine is far more advanced than anything that could be loosely described as health care in the Middle Ages, the disease vectors for plague haven’t changed.\nFleas feed on rodents, such as mice, rats, squirrels or gerbils, infected with the bacterium Yersinia pestis . The flea then becomes a carrier for the bacteria and passes it on to humans during its next feeding.\nThe disease can also travel directly from an infected animal to a person via a bite or scratch. Because of this, infected pets could also pass on the disease if, for example, an outdoor cat handles an infected rodent or is bitten by a flea carrying the plague.\nOnce infected, an individual usually begins to display symptoms anywhere between one and eight days, according to the National Library of Medicine . An infected person can then pass on the disease to others through cough droplets in the air, though such transmission is rare.\nVideo: The Plague: Still Here, Still Killing People\nPlague can take one of three forms. The bubonic plague, an infection of the lymph nodes transmitted only through a flea bite, leads to fever, headache, chills and swollen, tender lymph nodes. The septicemic plague, a blood-borne infection transmitted via flea bite or an encounter with an infected animal, can result from bubonic plague if left untreated or occur on its own.\nThis form of plague can cause bleeding in the skin and organs, and can lead tissue to turn black. Pneumonic plague, a lung infection occurring from inhaling droplets coughed by an infected person, can lead to respiratory failure and shock.\nBubonic plague is the most common form of the disease, accounting for anywhere between 75 and 97 percent of cases, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Health . Each form of plague has its own mortality rate, which largely depends on whether treatment options are available.\nPneumonic plague, the deadliest form of the disease, has a mortality rate of nearly 100 percent if left untreated within 24 hours after symptoms first arise. Even with antibiotics, anyone contracting pneumonic plague only has a 50-50 shot at pulling through.\nBecause plague is transmitted through contact with animals, plague cases most often arise from rural or semi-rural areas in the southwestern United States. The California Department of Public Health states (PDF) that plague has not occurred within rural or developed areas of the state within the past 100 years.\nGerbils, Not Rats Behind Spread of Black Death\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , between 1900 and 2012, 1,006 confirmed or probable human plague cases occurred in the United States. An average of seven cases are reported each year. Although plague can occur any time of year, it is most commonly seen in the late spring or early fall. So far this summer, six cases of plague have turned up in the United States, according to Forbes , three of which were fatal.\nWorldwide, between 1,000 and 2,000 plague cases occur every year, according to the World Health Organization. Since the 1990s, most plague cases have occurred in Africa, with countries like Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo among nations reporting the highest number of cases. Plague has also broken out in South America, particularly Peru, and Asia in recent years.\nTags plague Infectious Disease Diseases Disease Human ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "https://www.cdph.ca.gov/HealthInfo/discond/Documents/FactsAboutPlagueinCA.pdf", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2015/08/10/there-is-a-case-of-plague-in-la-here-is-what-you-should-know/", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2", "http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/plague/plague.html", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-child-diagnosed-with-plague/", "http://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000596.htm"], "published": "2015-08-11T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:00:49.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
