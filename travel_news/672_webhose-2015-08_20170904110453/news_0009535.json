The group, which held its first meeting Aug. 12, plans to deliver proposals in January of next year.\nThose fixes are long overdue. Heavy rains and landslides routinely mutilate stretches of deteriorating county roads. Those backward conditions resulted from decades of declining gas- and property-tax revenues and a broken funding structure.\nCurrent funding mechanisms are inadequate, raising only about $90 million of the $350 million total county officials say they need annually to fully fund maintenance, preserve infrastructure, relieve congestion and add capacity.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid The fixes are also lopsided. Most of the roads burden falls on residents of the county’s unincorporated areas. The county’s tax base — and revenues — have shrunk considerably as cities have annexed tens of thousands of residents in formerly unincorporated areas over the last three decades.\nOnly about 250,000 residents are left to support a network of 1,500 miles of roads and 181 bridges that accommodate more than 1 million trips per day.\nYet hundreds of thousands of people use King County roads to drive to neighboring counties and between cities. County officials should find ways to ensure nonresident drivers also pay a fair share of the costs.\nRoad funding comes from property taxes, gas taxes and outside government grants. That total amount is expected to decline from $90 million to $85 million by 2017 after the city of Sammamish annexes the Klahanie neighborhood.\nThis situation is dire.\nWith current funding, potholes and sinkholes are patched, but underlying issues go untouched. Major repairs happen after emergencies such as roads collapsing from heavy rains or landslides. In March 2014, a landslide took out a lane on May Valley Road near Issaquah that finally was rebuilt this summer — the project was delayed while the county waited for federal money.\nKing County’s roads have been neglected for too long. The County Council is right to tackle the huge problem.\nSeattle Times editorial board", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T04:05:20.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
