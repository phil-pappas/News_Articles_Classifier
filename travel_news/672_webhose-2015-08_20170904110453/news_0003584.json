For pet owners, the idea of bringing their pets along is an exciting proposition. Dr. Metzger of Rainbow Veterinary Hospital in Burbank, California, encourages pet owners to do a little advanced planning in order to make this a beautiful memory for man and man's best friend. \"Making a few key plans ahead of time can make a world of difference in the travel experience for pets and their owners,\" says Dr. Metzger . \nBefore heading off into the sunset with pets, owners should take a few additional precautions, according to Dr. Metzger of Burbank, California's Rainbow Veterinary Hospital . Before heading off for vacation with a pet, these are a few things Dr. Metzger recommends for pet owners. \nConduct a trial run to make sure pets don't get car sick. It's one thing to take pets on short rides around town, but make sure they aren't susceptible to car sickness if you are making a longer trip. No one wants to go on a long road trip with a pet who is going to be miserable and ill for the entire trip. Veterinarians can prescribe medications to help with this problem. \nMake frequent stops to allow pets an opportunity to answer nature's call, drink a little water and get a little exercise. Throw a ball or two and let them run a little bit to work off some energy. \nNever leave pets in the car while traveling. Even a few minutes on a hot summer's day can do irreparable harm to pets. \nDr. Metzger also suggests that pet owners bring along a few critical items, including: pet's shot records, familiar foods and treats, comfort toys and possibly calming sprays for those times when the pet must stay in the hotel while the family is out. \n\"Pet owners should also bring along a travel crate,\" says Dr. Metzger. \"Not only does this provide a safer, more comfortable place for pets to ride in cars, but it's also a place where they can feel at home despite being in strange surroundings with new smells and unfamiliar noises.\" For pet owners reluctant to crate pets while driving, Dr. Metzger recommends using a safety restraint and keeping pets out of seats that have airbags. \nDr. Metzger also recommends keeping pets on a leash at all times when traveling as it makes it easier to retrieve their pets if they bolt due to startling noises. \nAbout Rainbow Veterinary Hospital \nLocated on Empire Avenue in Burbank, California, Rainbow Veterinary Hospital offers a wide range of preventative and healing treatments for the local pet population.
