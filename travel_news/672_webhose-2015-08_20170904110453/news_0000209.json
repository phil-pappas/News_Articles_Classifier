The Beach, which spans the length of the museum's Great Hall, was created in partnership with Snarkitecture, and covers 10,000 square feet and includes an “ocean” of nearly one million recyclable translucent plastic balls. Carolyn Kaster, Associated Press Summary \nYou could easily spend a whole visit to Washington exploring the museums, galleries and monuments along the National Mall. But that would be wrong. \nWASHINGTON — You could easily spend a whole visit to Washington exploring the museums, galleries and monuments along the National Mall. But that would be wrong. \nYou'd miss out on all the energy, nightlife, parks, culture, sports and interesting food and drink in D.C.'s thriving neighborhoods. \nSee the must-sees like the White House and the Smithsonian. But carve out some time for the things locals love, too. \nWHAT'S NEW \nBe forewarned: Washington is under construction. A large swath of the grassy National Mall is torn up between Seventh and 12th Streets for a turf restoration project that won't end until January 2017. The Capitol dome is encased in scaffolding, and there are renovations underway inside the Capitol, too. The Rotunda will be closed through Sept. 7. And there's more construction near the Washington Monument, where the National Museum of African American History and Culture is rising on the last available spot on the mall. It's scheduled to open in 2016. \nUpdates from the White House: Tourists finally can take photos on the public tour, and the newly redecorated Old Family Dining Room has been added to the tour route. Outside, you can gawk at the extra spikes that have been added to ward off White House fence jumpers. \nBorn to shop? Check out the high-end retailers in the new CityCenterDC neighborhood. \nA convenient new way to get around: Hop on the $1 \"Circulator\" bus that makes a loop between Union Station and 15 stops around the Mall. \nCLASSIC ATTRACTIONS \nYou can't beat the free and plentiful historic sites and museums at the heart of the city. But do some homework to zero in on what most interests you. Or, surrender to happenstance and be surprised. \nImportant Lesson One: The Smithsonian is not one building. It's 19 museums, 12 public gardens, nine research centers and the National Zoo. You can't cover it all. Would you rather see the giant pandas (National Zoo) or the Hope Diamond (Natural History Museum) or the Star-Spangled Banner (American History Museum) or Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis (Air and Space Museum)? These are the kinds of choices you must make: http://www.si.edu/visit/ . \nImportant Lesson Two: You probably won't get inside the White House if you don't plan months in advance and line up tickets through a congressional office — https://www.whitehouse.gov/about/tours-and-events/ . You're also better off booking advance tickets for the Washington Monument and to tour the Capitol — http://www.recreation.gov/tourParkDetail.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=77811 and https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/plan-visit/book-tour-capitol . \nTIPS \nAvoid getting glares from locals when using Metro escalators: Stand on the right side, walk ahead on the left side. Clogging the escalators is the biggest peeve locals have with out-of-towners. \nPick up the Smithsonian's 35-page Visitor Survival Guide for a $1 donation; it distills the essentials into one pamphlet. \nPark your car and use other ways to get around. Ride the Metro: It's cleaner than New York's subway system though less extensive — http://www.wmata.com/. Rent one of the thousands of bikes stationed around town by Capital Bikeshare, http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/ . Take the red Circulator buses that loop through different sections of the city, http://dccirculator.com/ . Take a guided Segway tour, a fun way to see classic sites while trying out a new mode of transportation. Check out monuments from a new vantage point by kayaking the Potomac. Try the hop on, hop off tour options, including Old Town Trolley Tours, D.C. Ducks (land and water) and Big Bus.
