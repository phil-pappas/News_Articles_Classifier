Updated Articles and Resources Royal Botanic Gardens in the spring. © Australian Tourist Commission 1997 \nFor many, the best time to visit Sydney is in the Australian spring. This covers the period from September 1 to November 30. \nIt is a time of regrowth and, yes, spring is definitely in the air. \nAbout the only school holidays in this period occur from the week before to the week after the Labor Day holiday long weekend in early October. Spring weather \nExpect generally cool conditions becoming warmer in late spring. The average temperature should range from around 13°C (55°F) at night to 22°C (72°F) in the daytime in mid-spring. \nExpect from 69mm to 81mm of rain in a month. Spring is Sydney's dryest season. Spring accommodation \nOutside of the holiday periods, accommodation should be readily available and reasonably priced. Spring activities \nWhen the weather's fine and sunny, it's always a good time for the Sydney beaches (see pictures ). Go surfing, learn windsurfing. Cruise the harbour, live a ferry tale , visit Manly or Bondi ..", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:58:33.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
