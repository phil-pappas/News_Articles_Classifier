Proceeds from this annual event support cancer research at Washington Cancer Institute at MedStar Washington Hospital Center.\nSprint Four the Cure is a family-friendly event that includes a kids’ 100-yard dash, vendors, prizes, raffles, and a hot breakfast provided by Four Seasons for participants after the race. Partakers can register for the chipped run/walk as an individual or as a team to collectively raise funds for cancer. Last year’s event raised more than USD 50,000 for the cause.\nMore than 20 prizes will be awarded to first-place finishers in eight different age groups, including an extravagant two-night stay in an ocean-view room for two at Montage Laguna Beach (value USD 1,400) and a complimentary two-night stay with breakfast for two in Raya at Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel (value USD 1,500). Registrants are automatically entered into a raffle for a chance to win additional door prizes from DC’s finest restaurants, spas, and more. Sweet treats from Georgetown Cupcakes and other “Four Seasons touches” will await participants as well.\nA number of sponsors, including STG International, NewsChannel8, Modern Luxury DC, WJLA/ABC7, 94.7 Fresh FM, Graphcom, RS&A and TTR Sotheby’s International Realty, have already joined the cause. Sponsorship packages are still available and include plenty of benefits – logo on race T-shirts and website, participant entry, display table, and more.\n“I am proud of Sprint Four the Cure’s longstanding partnership with the Washington Cancer Institute at MedStar Washington Hospital Center,” says David Bernand, General Manager of Four Seasons Hotel Washington, DC. “Seeing patients fight and win against this deadly disease makes me truly grateful to all the volunteers and runners who make our donations possible.”\nWashington, DC has one of the highest cancer mortality rates in the country, and Washington Cancer Institute is the busiest cancer centre in the nation’s capital, having admitted an average of 2,188 inpatients each year over the past three years. Distinguished for providing the capital region’s best cancer care, MedStar Washington Hospital Center’s Cancer Institute provides the most comprehensive diagnosis and treatment options for cancer available.\nDr. Sandra Swain, medical director of Washington Cancer Institute, notes that “contributions from this event, together with the proceeds generated by the annual Four Seasons Drive Four the Cure golf tournament in June, continue to bolster the Washington Cancer Institute’s ability to conduct cancer research to make potentially groundbreaking new drugs available through clinical trials to our patients. We are sincerely grateful for the ongoing support provided by Four Seasons.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:12:08.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
