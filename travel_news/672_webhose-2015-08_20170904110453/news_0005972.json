We also strive to create a festival that grabs the attention of the media – it would seem we have succeeded on both fronts,” says Lisa.\nA consumer survey of almost 500 respondents indicated that 4 out of 5 attendees rated their Queenstown Winter Festival experience as ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’. Of those who had travelled from outside of the Queenstown region, 2 out of 5 people booked the trip specifically to attend the festival. Of this group 82% rated Queenstown Winter Festival as ‘Excellent’ or ‘Very Good’ confirming that the event helps boost tourism numbers at a time when town has capacity available.\nA key objective of the Queenstown Winter Festival is to generate wide spread media attention and the 2015 event surpassed any other year to date in the breadth of coverage. International, national, regional and local outlets all covered aspects of the event in print, broadcast and online channels. The Festival received close to $2.5 million in equivalent advertising value.\nDestination Queenstown owns the multi award-winning festival and CEO Graham Budd says he is looking forward to another fantastic festival in 2016.\n“The Queenstown Winter Festival is our way of declaring Queenstown open for the winter season and celebrating it with 10 days of fun and entertainment. The Festival is a big draw card for our visitors because they get a chance to enjoy the festivities, experience Kiwi culture at its best and mingle with the locals as part of their winter holiday in New Zealand’s premier visitor destination,” says Graham.\nWith dates in place for the 2016 event the focus will now be on working with sponsors and stakeholders to create another inspirational Winter Festival that everyone can look forward to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:44:53.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
