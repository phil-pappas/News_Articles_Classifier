It is also the only waterfront hotel at secluded Nai Harn beach. \nTHE NAI HARN Chief Operating Officer, Christoph Berger, said: \"We are delighted to have taken over such an iconic hotel. It is with a strong sense of responsibility we have done this and we will be respecting the heritage of the resort as well as looking to the future with design innovations that will make the most of its incredible location. \n\"Importantly too we will be fully embracing Southern Thai art and culture and bringing it into the resort experience both inside and outside of the resort so that guests can feel relaxed, inspired and engaged by the history and natural context of the destination.\" \nFreeform sculptural furniture and art pieces add rich textures throughout the resort while high ceilings and glass fa√ßades seamlessly work to integrate the beach and sea outside in a celebration of the environment. \nAll oversized guestrooms overlook the Andaman Sea, dotted with islands and sailboats, and are designed to open up the whole room, including the bathroom space, to the view outside, with a decadent four-poster daybed on the terrace providing the perfect vantage point. \nOther key features include a total of six dining experiences for guests from the all day dining restaurant to the rooftop deck and destination dining, intimate meeting facilities and wedding planning experts, and five treatment rooms at THE NAI HARN Spa. \nLaunched in 1986, high profile guests over the years have included Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, Prince Albert of Monaco, Prince Henrik of Denmark, former French president Jacques Chirac, the late actor Sir Peter Ustinov, dance legend Rudolf Nureyev, US actor Forest Whitaker and Roger Moore, who once dueled with the late Sir Christopher Lee as Scaramanga, 'The Man with the Golden Gun', on the now famously eponymous James Bond Island off the coast of Phang Nga, a short speedboat hop away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:52:04.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
