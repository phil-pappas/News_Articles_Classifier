Its has since then secured an additional 40 million euro unsecured facility to fund growth initiatives. \n\"I think given the size and position of Playtech, we can afford to do larger acquisitions,\" said Weizer, who has led Playtech for more than eight years. \nHe declined name possible targets or a price or even when the company would make an acquisition. \nPlaytech, which has a market value of about 2.9 billion pounds ($4.3 billion), had cash and cash equivalents of 780.3 million euros ($881 million) as of June end. \nBetfair Group Plc (LSE: BET.L - news ) and Irish rival Paddy Power Plc (LSE: PAP.L - news ) , both licensees of Playtech, on Wednesday agreed to a 5 billion pound merger, to stake a claim to leadership of Britain's online gambling market. \nPlaytech said the deal would boost its prospects as the 2.3 billion pound wager by its customer Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) to combine with bookmaker Gala Coral had done. \n\"We definitely see a further opportunity for Playtech to further extend and support companies in the process of their merging,\" Weizer said. \nLadbrokes, on announcing its merger, bought out partner Playtech from a digital marketing service deal. Playtech, which should benefit from the larger footprint of the merged entity, has taken a 9.7 percent stake in Ladbrokes. \nPlaytech's stock was down 1.8 percent at 875 pence at 1123 GMT on the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) . Up to Wednesday's close, it has rise 12 percent since its first acquisition in April.
