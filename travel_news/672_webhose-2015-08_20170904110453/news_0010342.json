Representative image. (Shutterstock Photo) \nAll you theatre fans, buckle up. The four-day annual festival Hriday Manch is all set to begin on August 27 in the capital. \nIn its fourth edition, the festival this year will be showcasing plays with a focus on the folk element. \nOrganised by the Sparsh Natya Rang, the major attraction of the festival would be the Hindi adaptation of Ibsen's A Doll's House this year. \n\"The idea behind the festival is to attract those who are not avid followers of theatre. That is why we chose plays which have universal themes. We also try to keep an element of folk every year. We want to encourage the art of theatrics that is peculiar to our country's heritage\", says Ajit Chowdhury, director of the Sparsh Natya Rang group.

Kulkarni is directed by Ajit Chowdhury. \nThe second play Gudiya Ghar is the adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's play. Directed by Basab Bhattacharya, the play would be presented by the group New Delhi Players. \nHenrik Johan Ibsen, a Norwegian playwright, who is largely responsible for the rise of modern realistic drama, was inspired by the belief that a woman cannot be herself in modern society since it is an exclusively male society. \nOne of the finest plays written on women's rights, it has the distinction of being the most performed play internationally. The play is as relevant today as it was in 1879. \nNext in line would be Mayaram Ki Maya, which is based on a folk tale. Directed by J P Singh, the play is written by Jay Vardhan. \nThe last production Mousaji Jai Hind is written and directed by Vasant Kashikar. The play presented by the roup Vivechana is adapted from a story by renowned Hindi writer Udai Prakash. The storyline revolves around an old man Mousaji who lives in an illusory world. \nThe plays will be staged from August 27 to August 30 at the Shri Ram Centre, Safdar Hashmi Marg, at 7 pm.
