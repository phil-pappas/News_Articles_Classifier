King of the world ... Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce earned $11.88 million in 2014-15 after pulling off a massive financial turnaround for the airline. Pic: AFP Source: AFP \nQANTAS has paid CEO Alan Joyce a staggering $11.8 million for his role in turning the Flying Kangaroo around. \nThe mega pay packet represents a pay increase of 490 per cent or close to $10 million more than last year, when the Group recorded a $2.8 billion loss. \nLast week, Qantas posted an annual profit for 2014-15 of $557 million, and an underlying gain of $975 million. Moving on up ... Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has seen his annual pay packet grow by almost $10 million in 2014-15. Pic: AFP Source: AFP \nMr Joyce’s salary included base pay of $2 million, a cash bonus of $1.9 million and $2.3 million from a “long term incentive plan”. \nHowever the biggest figure came in the form of a $4.5 million bonus reflecting the airline’s share price growth from $1 to $3.50. \nThe next best paid in the group was Qantas International CEO Gareth Evans, who took home $3.926 million just ahead of Jetstar boss Jayne Hrdlicka who was paid $3.905 million. \nQantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant earned $2.269 million for overseeing the enormously successful Frequent Flyer program. \nQantas chairman Leigh Clifford said the payments “were substantial” and deserved some explanation. Top performer ... Alan Joyce is now one of Australia’s best paid CEOs. Pic: AFP Source: AFP \n“In recent years our poor financial performance has resulted in pay freezes for many people at Qantas,” said Mr Clifford. \n“For executives there have been no pay rises for three years, no short term bonuses since 2013 and no long term bonuses since 2009. Last year Alan Joyce’s take home pay was cut by 40 per cent.” \nHe said the size of the turnaround in the Qantas Group’s financial performance was testament to “some very tough performance hurdles that have been met and exceeded”. \n“In particular the numbers are driven by the market value of Qantas itself which has increased from $2 billion to around $8 billion over the past three years,” Mr Clifford said. \n“This turnaround is also enabling us to pay up to 28,000 staff a share of $90 million in bonuses.” Bonus ... Qantas staff who had their pay frozen in the last 18-months will also score a bonus. Pic: Supplied. Source: Supplied \nMr Joyce’s 2014-15 pay packet makes him one of Australia’s better paid CEOs but he still trails Nine Entertainment boss David Gyngell who last year took home $19.5 million and chief executive of investment firm Arowana International Kevin Chin ($13.35 million). \nIn the airline world, Mr Joyce earned less than his counterparts at Delta ($23.1 million) and United Airlines ($16.8 million) but his remuneration should eclipse that of Virgin Australia CEO John Borghetti. \nLast year, Mr Borghetti pocketed more than Mr Joyce but Virgin Australia’s $49 million loss this year is unlikely to earn him a big bonus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T10:26:59.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
