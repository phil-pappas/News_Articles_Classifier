Davidson.\nDavidson became the brand's first design director in 1963. He created designs that defined the brand's factory custom motorcycles for nearly 50 years. Classic motorcycles designed by his styling studio included the Super Glide, which established the factory custom category in 1971; Low Rider; Heritage Softail Classic; Fat Boy; V-Rod; and Street Glide.\nThe exhibit includes his watercolours and personal memorabilia that inspired him — from American folk art to Native American artifacts — in addition to examples of his motorcycle designs.\nHarley fans know Davidson as \"Willie G.\" from his frequent participation in motorcycle rallies and other aspects of Harley culture. He is the grandson of one of the brand's founders, William A. Davidson.\n___\nNATIONAL PARKS IMAX\nA new 3-D film about America's national parks will be hitting IMAX theatres next year with Robert Redford as its narrator.\nThe film, \"National Parks Adventure,\" is scheduled for release in February to coincide with the centennial of the National Park Service next year. The movie will be shown in IMAX theatres around the world.\nThe film features mountaineer Conrad Anker, his stepson Max Lowe, who's an adventure photographer, and family friend Rachel Pohl visiting Yellowstone National Park, the Everglades in Florida, Arches National Park in Utah and other places.\nThe movie captures the beauty of these preserved wild places and unique landscapes with the goal of inspiring travellers worldwide to visit.\nThe film was made in collaboration with Brand USA, the destination-marketing organization for the United States.\nRedford also stars with Nick Nolte in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" expected in theatres in early September, based on author Bill Bryson's funny account of walking the Appalachian Trail.\n___\nAIRBNB IN AFRICA\nAirbnb reports that it has more than doubled its listings for Africa in the last year.\nGrowth has included a more-than-double overall increase in the number of people staying in Airbnb listings on the continent, as well as a more than doubling of Africans using Airbnb.\nFor example, in Kenya, there are now more than 1,400 listings available to book through Airbnb, with more than half of them in Nairobi.\nListings around the continent range from a studio on a lagoon in Namibia that promises \"birdwatching from your doorstep\" for $45 a night to $60-a-night guestrooms in a beach house on the Indian Ocean on the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:59:31.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
