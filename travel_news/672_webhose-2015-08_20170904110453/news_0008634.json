It will ease traffic congestion, improve connectivity and boost the local economy. Today’s planning permission gives the green light for the start of construction and brings us one step closer to delivering these huge benefits.\n“This is further proof of our commitment to investing in Britain’s railways as part of our long-term economic plan.”\nHelen Warnock, Network Rail area director, said: “Cambridge is one of the fastest growing cities in the UK and this new station will not only help to meet existing demand but also unlock future growth. It will provide fantastic facilities for passengers and help take pressure off the main station and reducing congestion in the city.”\nFunded by the Department for Transport and developed by Network Rail in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council, the new station will provide an alternative connection point for commuters in north-east Cambridge, with an anticipated 3,000 journeys being made from the station every day.\nBuilding work is set to start this autumn and the new station is anticipated to open in December 2016. A decision hasn’t yet been made on the name of the new station and is expected to be announced later this year.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:16:17.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
