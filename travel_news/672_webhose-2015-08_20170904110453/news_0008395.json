It is organized by ICCA headquarters in Netherlands through the Africa Chapter office, based in South Africa, and brings together convention centres in Africa, association executives and meeting planners who organize high profile conferences in Africa.\nDuring this event, in Cape Town, Calabar ICC made a destination presentation to University Professors and association executives from eight countries; Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroun, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia.\nThis group of professionals represented conference sectors and subjects that Calabar ICC would like to attract to Cross River State, Nigeria. Calabar ICC is bidding for the opportunity to host association conferences in the various key sectors such as Medicine, ICT, Tours & Travel, Public Relations, Labor and importantly, from a Nigerian point of view, in the sector of Agriculture.\nCalabar ICC has identified these associations and will continue to work on building relationships with these professionals to bid for the respective conferences that they represent.\nCalabar ICC also hosted, as part of the conference, the gala dinner – a move that allowed us an opportunity to, not only put the destination on the map but also present Calabar, Cross River State and Nigeria as an emerging business tourism destination hub in Africa.\nZambia is the next host for this conference after South Africa and we intend to make bidding for this event in Nigeria a ‘strategic first’ for Nigeria and Calabar ICC. It is our hope that Calabar ICC will be in a position to host ICCA Africa Chapter conference in 2017 in West Africa for the first time.\nSource:-Calabar International Convention Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T05:23:18.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
