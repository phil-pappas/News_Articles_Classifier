The whole month of July just about every city in the United States has, in some way or another, had a celebration to commemorate this historic Civil Rights Law. Hard to believe it's only been 25 years, when you think of all the different civil rights movements, it seems amazing that until July 1990 just about every minority had a law protecting their civil liberties except people with disabilities. But as President George Bush Sr. said, \"Let the shameful walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down\" and so they began to tumble. \nI have found myself feeling a bit cynical because fundamentally I would rather see the money spent on creating jobs or accessible transportation rather than hundreds of small, random celebratory fireworks. But I attended the US Department of Transportation's (DOT) Celebration in Washington DC this week because I know that my advocacy work is important and helpful to the DOT and I enjoy mingling with people who think access is important. \nThe event was short and to the point, a quick celebration to get everyone together and to build some teamwork across government agencies and disability community organizations. No food or drink (there was cold water because DC in July can be unbearable), only an ADA Birthday cake which was yummy. Actually I caught myself feeling proud to have a disability, I mean to hear the DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx say that he wants to see more access in airports, more curb cuts, audible crossing signals and to help get Amtrak back on track . I really felt rejuvenated. \nI feel like Amtrak is my family because we, the Open Doors Organization staff, trained nearly 10,000 front-line Amtrak employees on accessibility, 95% of whom wanted to see more access at Amtrak stations and one of my dearest friends and mentors in disability advocacy works at Amtrak. I know for sure he's working on making rail more inclusive. But I also noticed how the discussions at the DOT event were centered more on the future of transportation. Secretary Foxx gave a reasonably timed and inspiring speech on what he would like to see, not just tomorrow, but in 10 years and he fully committed the US DOT to protecting and enhancing the lives and rights of this ever growing minority. \nI also heard that discussions at the US Access Board's concurrent celebration were centered towards issues such as ride-share and transportation network companies (TNC) and how access plays into this new business model. I get the feeling that while the disability community has yet too completely figure out what to think of ride-shares and TNC's, but we have accepted the fact that it's likely here to stay and it could increase our options for \"safe, reliable, and independent\" forms of transportation. I put that in quotes because that is exactly how I feel and it's what the US DOT is trying to achieve. So after hearing the Secretary speak I felt like, \"I am on board ready to make some changes.\" \nThis blog commends the US DOT, many different moving parts, for being smart but also because Secretary Fox made a handful of announcements that I feel were very progressive and futuristic. He stated \" I have directed senior leadership here to develop a DOT-wide system for travelers to submit their concerns about accessibility on sidewalks, buses, trains, and planes.\" Sounded a little like a \"one-stop\" location for everyone and anyone who feels they have experienced discrimination or those who want to report an issue but have no idea how. \nHaving a central place to do this would really help make people feel like they are being heard. This means that if you feel wronged on a train, plane, bus, ship, car or whatever form of transportation the US DOT will have a phone number, website or other technologies available as a safe place for people with disabilities their families and caregivers to complain when things do not go as planned. This is cool and does signify how transportation will someday have seamless, inter-modal ease of use from city to city, state to state. He also stated, \"The rule also requires airports to have high-contrast captioning on televisions and audio-visual displays and to work with carriers to provide lifts if accessible boarding bridges for passengers are not available .\" Meaning maybe people with reduced mobility will no longer require an Olympic event to get them into and off of an airplane. \nMaybe now there will be less of a spectacle when transferring people with disabilities into the narrow, odd looking, Hannibal Lecter aisle chair used to get people to their seats. If you've seen the aisle chair and the movie, you know exactly what I am talking about. Finally, I want to say that future of accessible transportation is really becoming a cool movement and I look forward to seeing every big city and small village stand up and say \"Lets change!\" The other day I had to give a presentation to a group of City of Chicago people and members of the disability community. I have been trying to figure out how taxis across the world can work in different ways to help people with disabilities get around and frankly it's been a sideways measure. In fact, I have actually caught myself crying from the frustrations of others working against the idea of accessible taxis. \nI just don't understand how people do not see the inequalities but from the very start of my presentation I felt my opportunity to speak was flailing. I normally have no trouble speaking to hundreds or thousands of people, but the other day I finally got nervous, maybe it was because my wife was the room or maybe it was because I forgot the password to the software system I was showing but near the end I felt like crying, but then it hit me, I remembered what I was really doing there, advocating for change, so I mustered up some courage and said with my eyes swelling, \"I bet Rosa Parks, as tough as she was, had a few times when she sat alone and cried.\" More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:56:25.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
