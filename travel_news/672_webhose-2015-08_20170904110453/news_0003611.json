I am 12 years old and standing in my Sunday best near my home in Jamaica. Eight years earlier, my mother had moved to Birmingham to go to nursing college , leaving me with my grandparents. A lot of people were in my position, with family in England, so it was customary for a photographer to travel from village to village on a Sunday and take portraits for people to include in letters overseas. We would get the same in return, only the photographs from England were taken in high-street studios, which people dressed up for. To match that, we would drag out our best clothes and stand next to furniture and flowers. Some people even wore white gloves or held prop telephones – anything to give the impression we were better off than we were. The results were earnest, awkward-looking portraits, almost like outdoor versions of early Victorian photographs. People had been coming and going from Jamaica for a while. Subsistence farming was very poorly paid, so people were going to America and Canada to work for six months. When word spread that it was possible to go to Britain for at least five years (the duration of a passport), we thought, ‘If we can earn so much in the USA for six months, what could we make in the UK?’ It was gradual at first – some older people were reluctant, like my grandparents – but later a mass exodus happened when tighter immigration laws were proposed. The usual thing was for some of the family to go ahead and put roots down, which is what my mother did. We joined her in 1965. I flew alone: a young boy from the hills on a plane for the first time, not unhappy at leaving but with no idea what I would find. When I arrived in Birmingham it was just so flat . It wasn’t green; there were no trees. At first I thought every house was a factory – they all had chimneys and smoke coming out, which I associated with industry. I was in England, though, and with my family, so I came with a happy, open mind. My mother had remarried and was running a shop, so I was able to meet lots of other immigrants in the neighbourhood. Some were from the Caribbean or Africa, many were from Ireland, and some were Sikhs. Later the Pakistanis and Indians came, and recently lots of Eastern Europeans. There are now hundreds of languages spoken in Birmingham schools. The changes have been great, and I have seen most of them. It has been my home ever since.
