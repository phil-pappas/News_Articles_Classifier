Furthermore, it also aimed to promote creative youth and new generation to engage in reviving eco-tourism, raising awareness of natural and cultural resources conservation and protection and boosting sustainable tourism. It was thus conducted as a competition event under the name 'Seven Shades of Green.' In the final round, we only had 7 teams selected from 160 teams. Each team had to plan and create a travel program, which should promote the conservation of environment based on the 7 Greens concepts.\nAll 7 local communities included in the travel programs will be further promoted through public relations and networking of online travel agencies, both domestic and international. He hoped that this activity could play a vital role in driving eco-tourism trend and generating income for local communities.\nMs. Pataraporn Sithivanich, Executive Director, Product Promotion Department of Tourism Authority of Thailand addressed that Thailand's nature, culture and local lifestyles have attracted millions of visitors each year. Although a growing number of tourists visiting Thailand might have contributed to a rising income of local communities, but it might also lead to adverse impacts in many areas, in particular environment. Furthermore, excessive use of natural resources might pose a danger to environment and lead to degradation of tourist destinations. Hence, we needed to create travel programs that promote the conservation of environment based on the '7 Greens' concept. The travel programs created under Green Rangers project can also be purchased online via www.hivesters.com . This should provide a unique opportunity for both domestic and foreign travellers to have personal encounters with local culture and lifestyles of all 7 communities.\nFor media inquiry, please contact Ms. Ploypailin Pungvongsanuraks 086-391-9895.\nMs. Ploypailin Pungvongsanuraks\nTourism Authority of Thailand (TAT)\n086-391-9895\n releases/green-rangers-awards-and-competition----results-announced-300129368.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH80894&Transmission_Id=201508180835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH80894&DateId=20150818", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/green-rangers-awards-and-competition----results-announced-300129368.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.hivesters.com/"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T16:17:13.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
