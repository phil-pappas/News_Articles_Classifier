Train Travel Fitness - Faux Pas or Practical? 0 \nTrain travel and Indians are as inseparable as the legendary Tom and Jerry themselves - neither can they do without, nor can they live in peace. All the measures taken to make Indian Railways a well managed and convenient travel system are worthy of applause, but little do the policy makers think that the traveler is first a human, with the basic human instinct of hunger. If not satiated in a defined fashion, this instinct rules the opinions of the masses and all efforts in making the system a popular one go futile. \nName your toxin \nFor fitness freaks and the aware alike, train travel spells doom because of the non availability of health friendly eating options on board. Deep fried, stale, spicy, oily and food inedible due to various other factors scares the fitness conscious travelers. To counter this, such crowd is often seen with special bags and baggage full of food. This adds to the weight, nuisance, difficulty and tediousness of travel. God bless you if you are planning a trek in Jammu and Kashmir and you live in Chennai, daring to travel the entire distance by rail. Fitness maintenance starts from your plate. What you put in your mouth is what you will become soon. While traveling, since any other method of keeping your fitness level up like exercise is ineffective at least one can stay in homeostasis by consuming freshly made food. Thanks to the non-availability of options, that goes out of the window as well. What remains is the huge temptation of munching on unhealthy or stale food that is tasteless too. \nThe changing picture \nWhat is of note is the fact that there is a change visible on the horizon. For the fitness conscious, agencies providing fresh food of choice delivered on the train berth from the railway station of choice have come just when the horizon had started to look jaded.

One can simply log on to the website addresses available using one's smartphone, download and use apps, or simply call on the full service phone numbers provided. Placing orders and getting delivery is extremely easy. \nThe bottom line \nNow staying fit while one is on the go is not as tough as it used to be before the advent of these fitness-friendly food delivery services. Does not hurt to try them out and feel the difference in your stress levels while you opt for train travel with ease. It is indeed a practical and pocket friendly option to go for.
