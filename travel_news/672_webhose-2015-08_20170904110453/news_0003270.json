They include tips on keeping dogs safe over the holidays ( A Dog's Worst Holidays: New Year's Eve and Fourth of July ), the importance of having identification tags and proper leashes, collars and walking harnesses ( For the Want of a Nail ) and the health risk of filling your dog's water bowl from an ordinary garden hose ( Drink Safe this Summer ). \nRecently, my good friend Laura Evans experienced a real-life situation that reminded me of another article: The Five Most Important Things You Can Do While Traveling in the Car with Your Dog. The number one thing on the list? \n1. Never, ever, leave your dog alone in a hot car. \nSimple trips to the grocery store this summer will end in a completely preventable tragedy for many dogs. Don't let this happen to your dog! \nSaw a dog left alone in a hot car on Friday when it was 88 outside. What happened next affected me so much that I spent all weekend making this video (and song at the end). PLEASE SHARE IT COULD SAVE A LIFE! Also, we are still looking for our sweet Buster. Please keep an eye out for him, reward no questions <3 https://facebook.com/busterofglendale \nPosted by Laura Evans on Monday, August 3, 2015 \nAs Laura Evans' video so perfectly highlights, leaving your dog in a hot car is incredibly dangerous. So much so that in many states it is illegal. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, on a 70-degree day, the temperature in your car can rise to almost 90 degrees in 10 minutes, and almost 100 degrees in just 20 minutes. Even more deadly (?), on a 90-degree day, the temperature in your car can rise as high as 135 degrees. Contrary to popular belief, cracking a window has very little effect. \nThe remaining four items on the list are rarely discussed, but can mean all the difference to the wellbeing of your pup. \n2. Always have backup water available. \nYou'll notice the word \"backup\". It's easy to make the mistake of leaving your dog's usual water supply somewhere shady in your parked car, such as on the console or the seat, before you set off. If the sun's change in position causes it to beat down on the water, it can easily become too hot to drink (think of that 160-degree interior, combined with the heat of direct sunlight). Get in the habit of setting aside extra water for your dog in a thermos or small ice chest. By being conscious of a backup water supply, you'll help your pup stay cool, and healthy. \n3. Try a little DIY canine air conditioning. \nRemember, even if you use your car's air conditioning, there is no guarantee that your dog, often in the back seat, the rear of the car or possibly in direct sunlight, will be as cool as you are. On long drives on hot days, I always had a bag of ice in my car. I was in the habit of driving with the windows open, causing the hot air to circulate inside the car. To keep my dogs cool, I'd simply take unopened bags of ice, put them in sealed, heavy-duty garbage bags and surround the bags with beach towels. They'd lie on the beach towels and stay comfortable for the ride. Afterward, I'd transfer any remaining ice to their bowls to allow it to melt for drinking. Concerned with the possibility of ice melting in your car? Pick up an appropriately sized rubber mat with a raised edge at your local hardware store and lay that down first. Or, for a little extra investment, you can purchase dog-cooling beds that will serve the same purpose. \n4. Hot Car \nNever ask a dog to jump into a hot car. It'd be like asking your best friend to climb into a pre-heated oven - with a fur coat on. Open all the doors and windows and let the car cool off a bit. With that in mind, let your air conditioner do its thing for a while. Both you and your dog will be grateful! \n5. Hot Seats \nJust because your car has cooled off a little, that doesn't mean the car seat has! Always carry an extra beach towel to spread over the seat so your dog doesn't feel the discomfort or pain of a sunbaked surface. Imagine how it would feel if you were sliding onto a blazing hot car seat in a bathing suit. Treat your dog like you would treat yourself! \nOf course there are many other safety precautions to remember while traveling, such as making sure you have a first aid kit, that you have all your dog's supplies and so on. But these five tips are just as important and will help keep you and your dog happy and, most importantly, safe! \nFollow Paul Owens on Twitter: www.twitter.com/PaulOwensODW More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:09:50.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
