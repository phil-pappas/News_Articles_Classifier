The oldest falconry school in Ireland runs private \"hawk walks\" by appointment for guests at Ashford Castle and today it's my and Kelly's turn. The school's residents - among them Joyce, Wilde and Beckett - are on their daytime perches in the large aviaries clustered around an open courtyard, where they preen, bathe, soak up some sun and socialise with their feathered kin. \"They can shoot the breeze with each other out here,\" says Conal. \"They can watch the dogs (the estate's two Irish wolfhounds) and get stimulation from all the comings and goings. But they feel safe because they are tethered.\" At night, the formidable birds of prey repair to their room in an adjoining building, where each has its own pedestal covered in synthetic turf to prevent infection and injury. Kelly Gardiner \nFalconer Conal Dixson with one of his charges. \nUnless molting or \"a bit poorly\" they fly free on the estate at least once a day and any birds caught in heavy rain are dried with the hawks' own hairdryer. \nThe building also has \"chill out\" rooms - been there lately, Reginald? - and a freezer full of very small, very fluffy, very dead male chickens (mice, quail, chicken and beef are also on the menu). \nBut now it's time to fly. Andes, my hawk for the next hour, is a small but powerful 18-month-old male, while Kelly is paired with slightly larger Lima. Like the other birds here, they are not tame but have been trained for the hawk walks. Conal brings them out separately to meet us. Lima is followed by Andes, who sits calmly on the thick glove covering my outstretched left fist and peers at me intently while Conal tethers him with slim strips of soft kangaroo leather. The jesses are threaded through my glove and a bell is attached to each of Andes' feet so I can follow him in flight. With my arm in front and raised slightly, elbow tucked in as instructed, we take a forest path to a nearby clearing. \"Hawks are co-operative with each other but essentially competitive,\" explains Conal as Andes suddenly flutters on my arm, alert to a rustle in the undergrowth. \"Don't get between the hawks and their food.\" I wouldn't dream of it. Each bird has its own idiosyncrasies, too. \"Some like dogs, others hate kids. Some are high energy, others like to fly back to the school and try to murder the owl.\" Kelly Gardiner \nThis way to the falconry school on the Ashford Castle estate. \nOnce in the open space, Andes and Lima are untethered and we try a couple of test flights. I practice holding my arm straight out to the side, then sweeping it across my body, which gives Andes the signal to fly. \nWhen it's time for the real thing, Lima goes first and with a sweep of my arm, Andes quickly follows. \nFor the next 45 minutes they swoop and soar overhead, alight in nearby trees, and prowl the forest floor in search of food. \nAnd every few minutes, Andes returns at my signal - gloved hand out in front and facing in his direction, with a scrap of raw beef tucked into my fist. \nMy confidence grows and my heart leaps with pleasure each time he wings his way back to me, settles on my fist, and expertly extracts the food tucked under my thumb. \nIt's all too easy to romanticise such an exhilarating experience. But really, it's all about the beef. \nThe writer was a guest of Ireland's School of Falconry.
