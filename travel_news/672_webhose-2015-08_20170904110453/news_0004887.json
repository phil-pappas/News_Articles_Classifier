The launch of this new code share agreement with our fellow oneworld member airline, Royal Jordanian, demonstrates this and will allow passengers to benefit from seamless journeys around the globe.” \nRoyal Jordanian President/CEO Captain Haitham Misto said: “Royal Jordanian and Qatar Airways enjoy a strong relationship, and they are both keen on providing superb on-board and on-ground services. This agreement will further enhance the cooperation between our two companies, thus offering our passengers more travel options and frequencies to cities around the world.” \nQatar Airways has seen rapid growth in just 18 years of operations, and is currently flying a modern fleet of 162 aircraft to more than 150 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. \nRoyal Jordanian, the national carrier of Jordan, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. Eight years ago it became a public shareholding company, with a vision to connect Jordan and the Levant with the world. In 2007, Royal Jordanian was the first Arab carrier to join any of the three global airline alliances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:34:13.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
