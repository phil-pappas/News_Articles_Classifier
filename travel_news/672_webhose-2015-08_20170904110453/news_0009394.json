Japan is also seeking to expand medical tourism, but has run into difficulties securing enough doctors and training interpreters with medical expertise.\nBeijing Yuho Rehabilitation Hospital, also located in the district, is planning this autumn to open a dedicated facility for foreign patients. The facility, with polite nurses and sparkling rooms reminiscent of a hotel, is designed so patients can be comfortable throughout their treatment.\nThe hospital has gathered the latest medical devices from around the world. One example is a pool in the rehabilitation facility that changes depth at the touch of a button.\nBut Yuho Hospital does not just perform surgery and dispense drugs. It also incorporates ideas from traditional Chinese herbal medicine when offering pain relief. The hospital even offers patients tours on herbal medicine culture and other topics.\nAnd with its central location, patients can visit the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and other nearby tourist spots during their stays.\nChina has 46 medical facilities that have been accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI), an American hospital accreditation system that is seen as an indicator of advanced medical care. The China figure is the highest for an Asian country, followed by Thailand with 44 JCI-accredited facilities.\nPatients tend to go abroad for advanced medical care if it is cheaper than in their home countries.\nAccording to the Development Bank of Japan, cardiac valve replacement surgery costs about $170,000 (about Â¥21 million) in the United States, but only about $36,000 in South Korea and about $1,700 in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:05:54.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
