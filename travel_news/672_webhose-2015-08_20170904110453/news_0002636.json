Frontier says these savings will allow it to offer fares at discounted prices.\nThe “ultra-low-cost” model is something that has become increasingly popular within the past decade as airlines are opening up to a niche of cost conscious customers. Frontier is trying to follow that model, but the shift has provoked customer complaints as they have to adjust to the changes.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_28617297/frontier-airlines-eliminates-toll-free-customer-service-calls", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/05/12/complaints-against-airlines-rise-frontier-ranks-worst/27162829/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlGL0g%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlFZco.img&description=michaladdady+-+Provided+by+Fortune", "http://fortune.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBlGL0g%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBlGQ8N.img&description=Second+Texas+Healthcare+Worker+Tests+Positive+For+Ebola+-+Provided+by+Fortune"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:55:26.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
