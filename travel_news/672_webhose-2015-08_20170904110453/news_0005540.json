Cotopaxi, a volcano not far from the Ecuadorean capital of Quito, sent large gray puffs 3 miles into the sky, officials said.\nA yellow alert has been declared by Geophysics Institute. However, impending probability of a major eruption has been ruled out.\nYellow alerts are the lowest of three and are in place to warn residents to take precautions such as using masks to cover their mouths and to be prepared in case evacuations become necessary.\nAsh could reach Latacunga, Machachi and Quito on Friday, Geophysics Institute officials said.\nCotopaxi is 5,911 meters (19,388 feet) in elevation. It last erupted in 1940. In the last major eruption in 1877, muddy debris traveled more than 100 kilometers (62 miles).\nEcuadoran officials have also closed Cotopaxi National Park due to the heightened activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:19:01.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
