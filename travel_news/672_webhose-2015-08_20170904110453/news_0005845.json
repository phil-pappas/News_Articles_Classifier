Nicoletta di Livio, Overome \nNicoletta di Livio of Overome shares her experience at the Festa della Madonna della Neve , held in Rome on August 5th: \nThere is an event you should not miss if you are in Rome during the first week of August. The Miracle of Saint Mary of the Snow is well known to Catholics all over the world and the Romans consider it to be one of the most typical occurrences among their own traditions. \nThe festival re-enacting the miracle takes place August 5th in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore , one of Rome's greatest churches and its biggest dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The legend of the miracle is fascinating and evocative. With the outstanding scenic effect of an artificial snowfall under the starry summer sky of Rome, the sound and light show in the square opposite the Basilica will reach your heart. \nAccording to tradition, during the 4th century, under the pontificate of Pope Liberius, a rich, childless Roman patrician called Giovanni and his noble wife decided to offer their goods to build a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The Holy Mother cherished their wish and during the night between the 4th and 5th of August, she appeared in their dreams through a miracle that revealed the place where the church should be built. The following morning the couple went to see the Pope and told him about the dream. He had had the same dream, so they all went to the unveiled place on the Colle Esquilino , and even though it was midsummer, they found it covered in snow. At first they thought it was a vision. Who could blame them? It doesn’t even snow in winter hereabouts, just imagine in summer! The Pope marked the perimeter of the new church according to the snowy soil area and had the sacred structure built at the couple's expense. \nEvery year, the moving and joyful commemoration of the miracle of the snow in the square of Santa Maria Maggiore welcomes thousands of Romans and tourists. The artificial foamy snow shot toward the basilica façade by two \"cannons\" joins special light effects and background music to create a moving scene. \nWhen I went to the event, by 9 pm the square was already crowded. The church facade was illuminated by fluorescent lasers and Handel’s music was playing in the background. The celebration opened with the touching notes of the Ave Maria . Many nuns and devotees stood out in the crowd with joined hands. Pope Francis, so humble and close to people, is fond of this event not only for the extremely engaging scenic impact, but also because of a tradition that represents a Basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary and built where a pagan temple used to stand, as well as the couple's generosity toward the less fortunate ones and the Blessed Virgin’s gift to those who don’t lose hope. \nSo, on a summer night, the city of Rome is wrapped in magic and turns into a Northern Capital. While the snow is blurring your sight, the eternal beauty of the Basilica arises stunningly. Among the mighty external columns and the splendid mosaics inside, here rests the great artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini , one of the beauty makers of a city which is continually astonishing, even under the snow on a hot August night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T06:29:55.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
