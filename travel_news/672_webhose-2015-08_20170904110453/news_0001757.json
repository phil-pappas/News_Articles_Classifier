The Federal Railroad Administration is expected to soon announce that it will lead the study and planning of new, regional-wide interstate passenger rail networks that could include better service between Cincinnati and Chicago. The FRA has notified stakeholders and Congress informally that it has chosen the Midwest and Southeast to spend $2.8 million to study and plan rail networks in those two regions. “Due to the complexities in coordinating among multiple states and other stakeholders, FRA is retaining these funds and leading the planning effort at the federal level, rather than awarding funds to entities through a grant or cooperative agreement,” the notice to Congress says. “In October 2015, FRA solicited statements of interest from states for participating in this FRA-led multi-state planning process.” The money will be used to “develop a long-term passenger rail vision.” The Cardinal Amtrak route runs between New York City and Chicago three times a week, with stops in Cincinnati in the middle of the night . Rail advocates have been attempting to build support for interstate service between Cincinnati and Chicago for more than a year, including garnering the support of Hamilton County commissioners and the region’s transportation planners for a study of the possibilities. They view the impending announcement as a big step forward but added that strong, local support will be needed for a Cincinnati-Chicago route to be among the routes given serious consideration. “Essentially this is our feasibility study,” said Derek Bauman , an Over-the-Rhine resident who is the Southwest Ohio director of All Aboard Ohio, an interstate passenger rail advocacy group. “It’s a huge win.” In addition to funding being available for studies and planning, rail advocates view the move as positive because it bypasses the Ohio Department of Transportation . Claiming it was too slow, Republican Gov. John Kasich canceled the proposed Cincinnati-Columbus-Cleveland Amtrak route when he took office in 2011, sent back $400 million in federal funding and is viewed as hostile toward any transportation initiative not involving cars. “The feds are maintaining control of it so we don’t have to rely on ODOT or OKI (the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments),” Bauman said. “They can be partners but they don’t have to control it.” Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota will be included in the initiative. \nWant Cincinnati Travel   Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:08:27.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
