These are good as part of a mixture of griddled or roasted vegetables, and with fish or chicken. SERVES 6 INGREDIENTS • 6 sea bream (about 300g each), gutted, trimmed and scaled • 4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for brushing • juice of 1 lemon • 9 baby gem lettuces • extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling For the aioli • 2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped • ½ tsp Dijon mustard • 2 egg yolks • 250ml mild olive oil • white wine vinegar, to taste • lemon juice, to taste • ½ tsp sweet smoked paprika • ¼ tsp hot smoked paprika • drop of chilli sauce METHOD Using a pestle and mortar, crush the garlic with a little flaked sea salt as an abrasive. Transfer to a bowl and add the mustard and egg yolks. Using a whisk or an electric beater, mix constantly while adding the olive oil a little at a time. Only add more oil when the previous lot has been incorporated – as the mixture begins to thicken, you can add oil more quickly. Season with salt and pepper, then add white wine vinegar and lemon juice to taste. Add the paprikas and chilli sauce, then taste again. Cover and put in the fridge until needed. Preheat the oven to 190C/gas mark 5. Put the fish in a roasting tin and brush inside and out with olive oil. Squeeze lemon juice all over the fish, and season. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove the outer leaves of the baby gems if necessary (often organic lettuces have a little soil trapped under these), then carefully trim the bases without cutting them off completely – you want the lettuces to remain intact. Wash the outsides, then pat dry carefully. Halve lengthways. Roll the lettuce halves in a dish with the olive oil to coat. Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot, then cook the baby gems, cut-side down first, for two minutes on each side. This seems like a long time, but the lettuces can take it – they will become charred and hot on the outside, while remaining firm in the middle. Transfer to a platter, season and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil. Serve with the fish and aioli.
