He Retired and Took a Solo Sailing Trip Around the World Brittany Jones Cooper Editor, Yahoo Travel August 20, 2015 \nStuart MacDonald didn’t set out to sail around the world. But after four years, he accomplished the amazing feat. (Photo: Stuart MacDonald) \nAfter sailing from Scotland to the Caribbean, Stuart MacDonald had a big decision to make. \nThe initial leg of his journey had taken about a year, and after sailing around the Atlantic, the only thing he had really gained was another year of life. \nIf he turned back now, life would go back to the way it was. But if he pushed forward, well, he didn’t really know what to expect. \nAs MacDonald sailed toward the Panama Canal, he realized that there was no turning back. “With the Panama Canal, because of the seasons and winds, once you enter, you’re committed,” he told Yahoo Travel. “It’s like jumping out of a plane.” \nMacDonald sailed through the Panama Canal, and with that decision he embarked on a journey that would take four years to complete and eventually take him around the world . \nFort Fitzroy. (Photo: Stuart MacDonald) \nFor as long as he could remember, MacDonald loved the water, and racing and sailing boats was his main hobby. As a young man, he even dreamed about sailing around the world. But after getting married and starting a family, his priorities changed. \n“You do what you have to do,” he said. “ I wanted to provide for my family, so I put my dreams aside, because I wanted to be a dad.” \nAfter his two children were grown were grown and his marriage had ended, however, MacDonald reevaluated his life. A stroke 10 years earlier had permanently affected his health, and at 63 years old he knew that if he didn’t make a move soon, he never would. \nRelated: Want to Retire in Your 30’s and Travel the World? This Couple Did! \n“I was nervous and kept telling myself, ‘I can’t retire,’” he admits. “I didn’t think I could afford to retire, but I thought about it, and that’s what I did.” \nA year later, at the age of 64, MacDonald hit the open water. “At first, it was difficult not to have any sort of day-to-day demands on my time,” he said. “But I eventually began to relax and accept that my job was to get in the boat and sail.” \nAnd sail he did. After cruising from Scotland to the Caribbean, MacDonald passed through the Panama Canal and headed to the Galapagos Islands before stopping on the Marquesas Islands. \nKamoka, Ahe, in French Polynesia. (Photo: Stuart MacDonald) \nBy some amazing twist of fate, his daughter called to say that she had quit her job and moved to a small atoll called Ahe in the Pacific Ocean to work on a pearl farm. MacDonald was about a week away by boat, so he stopped by to spend some one-on-one time. \n“When I pulled into port, my daughter was standing there on the dock holding a six-pack.” \nThe father-daughter duo spent three months sailing around Bora Bora, Polynesia, and Tahiti before he set off for New Zealand to watch Scotland play in the Rugby World Cup. \nBy then his story had reached some of the rugby fans in New Zealand, who were impressed by how long he had sailed. “The Scottish Rugby Union heard about my trip and flew me from my boat to the game,” said MacDonald. “They put me up in the five-star hotel, and I got to meet some of my rugby heroes. It was amazing!” \nMusket Cove, Fiji. (Photo: Stuart MacDonald) \nMacDonald spent the summer in New Zealand and then considered ending the trip. He planned to sell his boat and fly home, but import taxes were too high and he didn’t have the money to return. So after finishing the year sailing to and from Fiji, MacDonald realized that the only way he was going to get home was to sail there. \nBut taking the long way home (also the title of his book ) was easier said than done. After passing through New Caledonia and the Vanuatu islands, things got rough around the top of Australia. “The north coast is very harsh, windy, and hot,” he said. “There are crocodiles, and everything is more expensive because it has to be flown in.” \nAt this stage in his journey, MacDonald admits that he would have thrown in the towel if someone had offered him money for the boat and a ticket home. \n“I kept thinking, ‘If I was in jail, if I was trapped, if I was bankrupt … what would I dream of doing?’ And the answer was always ‘sailing around the world.’ When I was feeling down and exhausted, and almost had enough, that would get me through.” \nThe next leg took him to Mauritius, around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and then on to Brazil. He made a pitstop in Grenada and breezed by the Azores before the final stretch home in August 2014. \nIn total, MacDonald sailed 43,000 miles and crossed the Atlantic three times. (Photo: Stuart MacDonald) \n“I told my son and brother that I would be passing Falmouth off the coast of England at a certain time, and when I arrived they were standing there, jumping up and down and waving. It felt good to be home.” \nReadjusting to life on land wasn’t smooth sailing. MacDonald admits to sleeping on the boat for three days after arriving home because it felt more comfortable than sleeping in his house. \nRelated: Couple Begins Retirement With Biking Trip Around the World \nBut after the adjustment, he is healthier and stronger than he was before. He met new friends all around the world, visited remote villages, and sailed alongside pods of whales. “I had the most fulfilling four years of my life,” he says. \nFor others looking to get out of their comfort zone, MacDonald assures them that the freedom and independence that come from trying new experiences can be invigorating. \n“If you’re walking up a hill, you don’t realize how high you are until you reach the top,” he said. “The world is round, and if you keep sailing, you end up where you started. \nIt’s only now that it’s starting to settle in what I’ve done.” \nWATCH: How to Hunt for Buried Treasure in England \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
