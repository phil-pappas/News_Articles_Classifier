The Report was presented by the Chairperson of the Agriculture, Tourism and Natural Resources Committee, Hon Christophe Bazivamo. \nThe Report says that approaches such as early warning systems and modalities for flood and drought management need to be inculcated. Closely related to this aspect is the need for the Partner States and the East African Community to advocate for strong institutional and governance structures. \nIn addition, the Assembly is of the view that the Secretariat invests in climate/disaster focused research and tools Participatory Capacity and Vulnerability Analysis (PCVA) to boost the preparedness of the region. \nThe objectives of the workshop was to create awareness amongst Members of EALA on the critical cross-cutting subjects of climate change and gender; and to consider existing international and regional policies, strategies and regulatory instruments and frameworks on climate change and gender. \nAt the same time, the workshop sought to identify the role of Parliamentarians in implementation of Gender Sensitive Climate Change Policies and Practical measures. \nIn the past, EALA has passed several environmental Bills including Transboundary Ecosystems Management Bill (2010), the EAC Polythene Material Control Bill, 2014. The EAC Disaster Risk Reduction and management Control Bill (2014) is under consultation. Work has also commenced on the EAC Climate Change Bill and a Climate Change Fund. \nDuring debate today, Hon Abdullah Mwinyi called for demarcation of specific areas for cattle keepers so that enough fodder is realized and sustainability is realised. \nWe need a recommendation to that effect from the report such that it adds to the dimension of Climate Change and Gender. “Farmers are predominantly women while cattle keepers are pre-dominantly men”, he said. “There is need for a region-wide policy to deal with any imminent clashes that may arise”, he added. \nHon Mumbi Ngaru said natural and man-made events both contribute to Climate Change. “We have the Disaster Risk Reduction Bill pending before the House. It needs to brought forth immediately by the Council of Ministers”, she said. \nHon Susan Nakawuki lauded the city Council of Arusha for greening the City by planting more trees. We should all borrow from the successes of the City. \nShe called on the Partner States to ensure the EAC Climate Change Fund received funding. \nHon Valerie Nyirahabineza said the Assembly could champion the importance of the Climate Change Fund. “As an Assembly, we can support the Fund in a symbolic manner”, she said. \nHon Dora Byamukama, Hon Dr. Odette Nyiramilimo and Hon Sarah Bonaya also supported the Report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T13:46:15.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
