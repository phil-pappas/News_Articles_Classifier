Seattle is now 0-2, the first time it has started the exhibition season with two straight losses since 2002.\nGiving Seattle some good vibes on the flight home, though, was that week after allowing seven sacks in a 22-20 loss to Denver , a remade offensive line didn’t allow any until the third team was in the game in the fourth quarter.\nKey performers QB Russell Wilson: Completed 9 of 15 passes for 78 yards.\nTE Jimmy Graham: Had three catches for 39 yards, including a 21-yard reception.\nSeahawks offensive line: Did not allow a sack in the first half, when the starters played.\n“That’s good stuff,’’ said coach Pete Carroll.\nSeahawks-Chiefs | Aug. 21 Seahawks struggle on offense, fall to Chiefs, 14-13, in preseason game Fans and media members react on social media Seahawks Game Center Poll: Grade the Seahawks' performance against the Chiefs Q2: Bobby Wagner pick-six puts Seahawks back on top Q1: Chiefs take early lead on Jeremy Maclin TD catch Not so good is that Seattle had just 30 yards rushing on 12 carries in the first half and 36 on 18 through three quarters, unusual numbers for a team that led the NFL and set a franchise record at 172.6 per game.\n“It might change a little bit when number 24 gets in there,’’ said Carroll, referring to running back Marshawn Lynch, who again had the night off. “But we need to block better just in general.’’\nGame stats\nIn fact, the Seattle offense managed just two scoring drives out of eight possessions, both field goals, with the Seahawks’ only touchdown coming on a 25-yard interception return by linebacker Bobby Wagner late in the second quarter.\nThe starting offense went threeand-out its first two possessions, then managed 30 yards on its third before finally moving 59 yards in 14 plays to set up a Steven Hauschka field goal. Three Wilson passes to new tight end Jimmy Graham, including a long of 21, were the keys to the drive.\n“You can just see that he is going to fit really nicely with us,’’ Carroll said of Graham.\nBut some of the rest of the game didn’t provide quite as clear of a view.\nSeattle had 11 penalties which Carroll called “a way to lose a football game. It was too much to overcome the way we were playing.”\nThere were also three dropped passes and a few other mistakes that had Carroll concluding “we’ve got some stuff to clean up.”\nWhether the Seahawks will again need to make sweeping changes on the offensive line, though, is unclear.\nAfter the Denver debacle, the Seahawks moved backup tackle Garry Gilliam to starting right tackle, and right tackle Justin Britt to left guard. Drew Nowak, meanwhile, got his first start at center in what has been a rotation with Lemuel Jeanpierre.\nCarroll said he’d need to study the film to really know but didn’t rule out that the team could decide to stick with that five. Gilliam, in particular, appeared to hold up well going against Kansas City’s standout pass rusher Justin Houston.\nBut the improved pass protection was offset by the struggles in the running game.\n“We just didn’t get the kind of movement that we need,’’ Carroll said, adding that he didn’t think the running backs “missed a lot of stuff. I think we got knocked around a little bit.’’\nWhat the Seahawks think of their line could become clear this weekend. Carroll confirmed after the game the team is hosting free agent guard Evan Mathis, a 33-year old who made the Pro Bowl playing for the Eagles the last two years, for a visit. Mathis won’t be cheap (he was released by the Eagles after demanding a new contract that was due to pay him $5.5 million in 2015), and how the Seahawks feel the line played Friday night might help sway how seriously they go after him.\n“He’s coming in for a physical, that’s all,” Carroll said.\nThe Seahawks’ defense largely acquitted itself well, with the starting unit giving up a 14-play, 83-yard drive for a touchdown in the second quarter — aided by a face-mask penalty when Kansas City had second-and-21 at its own 23 — but otherwise keeping the Chiefs in check.\nLinebacker K.J. Wright, who led the Seahawks with six tackles, said the starters were motivated by a 24-20 loss to the Chiefs last November when Kansas City rushed for 190 yards. Wright said the team game-planned as much as it ever has for an exhibition game.\n“We really tried to redeem ourselves because last time we played the Chiefs, it was embarrassing,” Wright said.\nWagner, meanwhile, made good on a pregame boast, saying he had told Kansas City quarterback Alex Smith during warmups that he planned to pick off a pass and run it back for a touchdown. Wagner, a former Utah State player, said Smith, who went to Utah, responded by laughing.\n“I just sat back and read his eyes,” Wagner said. “I just felt the receiver behind me and I just broke on it the minute he threw the ball.”\nIt was the first touchdown Wagner has scored in any game since his days as a high-school tight end, he said.\n“It felt amazing,” he said.\nNotes\nCarroll made it clear afterward that the situation with Seattle’s is not as dire as it appeared during the game.\nSeattle listed seven cornerbacks as unable to play, all with varying injury situations.\nThe list included Jeremy Lane (arm, knee), Will Blackmon (groin), Richard Sherman (hip), Tharold Simon (shoulder), Marcus Burley (calf) and Mohammed Seisay (groin).\nBut Sherman, Simon and Blackmon all dressed in full uniform and participated in warmups and Carroll said they could have played if needed, and should play next Friday at San Diego. He also said Burley should be back next week.\n“We’re going to come back to pretty good health here this week,’’ Carroll said. “Those guys will all be able to play in this game if they make it through (practice).’’\nSeattle also played without the regular starting safety duo of Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor.\nThomas returned to practicing in pads this week but may not play in the preseason as the team attempts to give him as much time as needed to get ready for the regular season after having surgery in February to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder.\nAll of the absences resulted in a starting secondary of Cary Williams and DeShawn Shead at cornerback and Dion Bailey (strong) and Steven Terrell (free) at safety.\nShead has been playing primarily strong safety through camp but has played ample cornerback in his career and showing versatility may again be his entry onto the roster.\nRookie Tye Smith got the start at nickel.\nOf Shead, Carroll said: “It was a good opportunity for him to play and he held up against some good receivers.” …\nRookie defensive tackle Frank Clark was listed as one of the 19 players expected to sit out, having been limited in practice all week with a sore ankle. But Clark played and tipped a pass on his first snap and then played regularly throughout the first half. Clark also played some snaps in an alignment where he was at tackle alongside Bennett. …\nBackup left tackle Kona Schwenke left in the fourth quarter with a knee injury that Carroll said could be serious. Backup defensive tackle D’Anthony Smith suffered a cracked rib. Those appeared to be the only two new significant injuries. DT Jordan Hill sat out with a groin injury suffered in practice.", "external_links": ["http://scores.seattletimes.nwsource.com/fb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=20150821012&home=12&vis=26"], "published": "2015-08-22T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:41:12.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
