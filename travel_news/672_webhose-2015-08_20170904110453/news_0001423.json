But it is truly worth it, though getting there is a bit tricky. \nAfter a Ryanair flight from Stansted to Szczecin, a train to Miedzyzdroje and a local bus to Swietousc, we arrive at the aptly named “Camping Tramp”, situated on pinetree-covered sand dunes right inside the national park. \nWe fall asleep in our wooden lodge to the sound of the roaring waves of the majestic Baltic. And then? Wonderful sunsets, amazing quality of light, countless hikes exploring forests, lakes, remnants of Iron Age settlements, lighthouses, a bison enclosure and miles of deserted beaches with ancient trees naturally falling down from escarpments, as well as easy access to freshly caught local fish (fried or smoked). I recommend going in June when the park is half empty, it’s light until 11pm and there is reliable sunshine. \nElizabeth Turfus, from London, wins a £350 DialAFlight voucher More feedback from readers Sri Lanka \nThe 50-rupee entry fee to Udawatta Kele in Kandy, Sri Lanka, did not prepare me for the wonders within. Such a small amount for such a huge return: cannon-ball trees, ancient and hung with ropes of lichen, their munition-shaped fruits suspended from twisted branches; troupes of monkeys squealing with delight and displaying no desire to hide from my inquisitive eyes; bats, hung upside down, dormant in the steamy heat, waiting for darkness to ignite them. \nA vantage point over The Temple of the Tooth offers the same view that the last king, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, would have enjoyed before my ancestors imprisoned him. The city of Kandy is spread out below, beautiful and sacred; its people offer a warm welcome and share their amazing island and peaceful teachings with all who visit. \nKim Greenacre, Norfolk Canada \nKananaskis Park, 40 miles west of Calgary, is a magical place. The Rocky Mountains provide a spectacular backdrop to a very walkable park with many intriguing pathways always leading to yet another fantastic view. This park has it all: lakes, meadows and even the chance of seeing a black bear. Sitting on a viewpoint seat overlooking a deep valley – dotted with trees vivid with autumn colours – there was silence apart from birdsong. Heaven on Earth. \nAngela Jervis, Essex Tanzania \nRuaha National Park in Tanzania may not be the easiest place to get to but is well worth the effort. Why is it so great? Firstly, there is a variety of habitat: riverine, miombo woodland, granite koppies, and the Great Ruaha River. Secondly, there is exclusivity due to the small number of visitors. Thirdly, one can see four of the big five (no rhino). Rare sable and roan antelope are present, as are painted hunting dogs, cheetah, leopard and many lion. Fourthly, birding is exceptional with 571 species recorded. It is probably the nearest to paradise that I will get. \nIan Thompson, East Sussex Zambia \nIf you are in search of “wow” moments that will stay with you for a lifetime, the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia will offer them on a plate: standing under an open-air shower being eyeballed by a monitor lizard; canoeing across the river with hippos showing a tad too much interest; dinner delayed by an elephant examining the bar; and sitting in a jeep watching a lioness playing tag with three cubs. Vultures circle as they wait for leftovers from a kill, and you wake to the sound of a drum, courtesy of the ground hornbill. \nRosie Rushton by email United States \nThe Blue Ridge Parkway begins at Waynesboro in Virginia and continues to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina. The Skyline Drive snakes through the Blue Ridge Mountains for 469 miles and produces breathtaking views from the 275 scenic overlooks. The blue haze emanating from the trees gives the park its name, and in autumn the leaf colour is stunning. We found it tempting to stop at all the overlooks but it is best to select a few and savour the rest while travelling. \nStephen Giblin, Lancashire \nMount Rainier National Park in Washington state contains 25 named glaciers, 382 lakes and 470 rivers. Wildlife includes hundreds of wildflower species, 182 birds and 65 mammals. This cornucopia hosts two million people each year. Beyond the gateways, the park’s vastness envelopes them. \nFor an east view, take the Crystal Mountain gondola to the fine dining restaurant at the summit. The summer-only sunrise entrance offers a sublime drive to 6,400ft. Year-round access is from the south-west to Longmire and the higher Paradise Lodge – 100 years old in 2016. Don’t miss views from the Skyline Trail loop, or the easier subalpine Paradise Meadows and Grove of the Patriarchs. \nBrian Robinson, West Midlands Ireland \nAt the heart of the Derryveagh Mountains, in the north-west of Donegal, lies my favourite National Park, Glenveagh. Home to arctic alpines, hares and a herd of wild red deer, the landscape changes each season as heathers bloom and bog cotton flutters in the wind. Starting at the car park, I walked across the hills to the Poisoned Glen where bare granite rocks, edged with moss and lichen, jut from the blanket bog. \n• West coast of Ireland travel guide \nKestrels and peregrine falcons nest high in the cliffs and, if you’re lucky, you might see a golden eagle. \nThe view down to the valley and the ruined church, with Errigal, the county’s highest mountain, rising like a snow-capped cone from Dunlewey Lake is magical. \nMeraid Griffin, Hampshire Japan \nSetonaikai National Park in Japan is of particular significance as it was also where the world’s first atomic bond was dropped. This park covers parts of Hiroshima and also a famous world cultural heritage site, Miyajima. The island of Miyajima is well known for its temple floating on water. When approaching the island by boat from nearby Hiroshima at high tide, it seems almost as if the beautiful temple is idly taking a break on the surface of the sea. Staying on the island overnight is highly recommended as the last boat on/off the island is in the early evening and you can then enjoy staying at a truly secluded ryokan (Japanese inn) with only the friendly deer for company. \nChristopher Yeoh, London Spain \nPicos de Europa National Park in northern Spain remains unspoilt and a delight for hikers and bikers. It is a jewel with easy access to the terrific Costa Verde of Asturias and Cantabria, but there are numerous activities available in the Cantabrian Mountains and the villages of Picos de Europa draw you inland. \nTaking the cable car to the top of Funte Dé has to be a highlight; hiking the Cares Gorge and Lake Ercina to witness panoramic views also shouldn’t be missed. Rich in flora and fauna, the area offers not just beautiful scenery but also some wonderful gastronomic delights, including locally produced ciders and piquant blue cheeses. \nPammie Sissons, Gloucestershire \nEach week we offer a prize to whoever sends us the best travel tip.
