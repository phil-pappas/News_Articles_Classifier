The jackpot is ownership of gaming group Bwin.party . And someone at the table is bluffing. Next Tuesday, we find out who. \nFor the two bidders — 888 Holdings and GVC , the Aim-listed owner of Sportingbet — the stakes could not be higher as the loser is likely to become a takeover target for someone else. More Paddy Power-Betfair / Buyout funds / Rovio \nThis week’s £5bn merger between bookmakers Paddy Power and Betfair has sent a clear message to the rest of the gambling world: only the strong will survive. \n“That is a cracking deal,” says Brian Mattingley, chairman of 888, about the Power-Betfair tie-up. “It has to change the landscape.” \nNick Batram, a leisure sector analyst at Peel Hunt, predicts several further waves of consolidation , driven by an increasing burden of costs. \n“Regulation is expensive,” he says. “Taxes are always going up. Marketing costs are not going down and IT costs are going up all the time. If you are a gaming company, you have to have desktop and mobile sites, data analytics and a seamless experience across everything, whether it is an Apple Watch, an iPhone or an Android.” \nHe points to William Hill ’s spending on software development as an example of the cost pressures . \n“They spent £14m in 2010. Last year, they spent £45.5m. Obviously, the business is getting bigger and they want to do more IT in-house rather than through third parties, but the increase is dramatic.” \nBwin, 888 and GVC all released their half-year results on Friday — providing a clear view of the existential importance of the deal . \nBwin.party became the largest publicly quoted online gaming company in the world when it was formed from the $3.7bn merger of Bwin and PartyGaming in 2011. \nBut the combination soon turned out to be dysfunctional and Bwin lost its way — along with two-thirds of its share price. \nOn Friday, the group posted lower revenues but managed to turn a €100.4m operating loss for the first half of last year into a €5.3m profit, thanks to growth in mobile gaming and widespread cost savings. \nStill, its weakness was evident. Like many smaller gambling companies, Bwin blamed higher taxes and the lack of a football World Cup this year for its lack of success. Bosses behind the bets Denise Coates, Bet365 \nThe 44-year-old mathematics graduate from County Westmeath this week announced the £5bn merger of his strongly performing Betfair and his former employer, Paddy Power. The group will be a formidable mix of technology and marketing nous \nWith her brother, the 47-year-old from Stoke-on-Trent took a small bookmaker and turned it into Britain’s second-largest gambling company. She sold the shops in 2005 and put all her energies online after buying the Bet365 domain for $25,000 \nFor 888, problems in the online poker market and its lack of a good sports betting business — which it hopes to remedy by buying Bwin — meant pre-tax profits dropped 41 per cent in the first half, to $20m. \nAgain, the company blamed the UK’s new point-of-consumption tax: a 15 per cent levy on gambling no matter where the bets are made. Strip that out, says executive chairman Brian Mattingley, and 888 “is pissing all over GVC’s results”. \nKenny Alexander, chief executive of GVC, replied: “Brian is an intelligent man, so I do not know how he has come to that conclusion.” \nNevertheless, GVC also posted a fall in pre-tax profits, from £18m in the first half last year to £17.1m this year. Its revenues rose and its cash flow remains healthy, but GVC is still reliance on unregulated grey markets, such as Turkey. Bosses behind the bets Jim Mullen, Ladbrokes \nThe 53-year-old horseracing devotee began his career as a trainee at Mecca Bookmakers in London. He took the helm last year and was one of the first to move in the current phase of consolidation, tabling an unsuccessful bid for 888. \nThe 45-year-old Scot took charge of Ladbrokes in March, having previously helped William Hill make the transition into an online giant. Mr Mullen’s brief at Ladbrokes is the same: he has recognised the company’s website as a problem. \nAs the gaming market consolidates, and more markets become regulated, grey market income will shrink, predicts Scott Longley, a partner at Regulus, a gambling industry consultancy. \n“The companies in grey markets will find themselves boxed in while the big firms fight over the big stuff,” he said. \nMore deals are therefore likely, leading Mr Longley to anticipate the formation of four big players in the UK market: Paddy Power/Betfair, Ladbrokes/Coral, William Hill and Bet365. \n“Then you have to assume that William Hill does a deal,” says Mr Longley. “They have been left on the sidelines.” \nHe adds that William Hill could come back for a second bite at 888 , which it failed to buy in February. \nIn the past 12 months, William Hill’s shares have risen just 2 per cent, a reflection of the market’s dissatisfaction with its strategy. \nConsolidation could go further. Even the likes of William Hill and Ladbrokes/Coral may become targets for players such as the Canadian group Amaya, which pulled off the $4.9bn purchase of PokerStars last year. \n“This is now a global market,” points out Mr Batram. \nBut 888’s Mr Mattingley insists: “Whether we become a target for William Hill or not is irrelevant to me.” \nHe however hedges his bets by saying that the two companies have a “fantastic relationship”. \nIf 888 cannot buy Bwin, he says the company still has “several strategic and tactical acquisitions that we have always been looking at”. \nFor GVC, a failure to buy Bwin may dent its growth, and affect bonus schemes that would have allowed its top three directors to walk away with a combined £47.5m over the next two years — roughly a fifth of the company’s market capitalisation. \nGVC has denied that its directors’ remuneration would be affected if its bid does not succeed. \nOn Friday, Bwin said that, while it continues to recommend 888’s bid, it has resolved all the matters that concerned the board over GVC’s bid . It urged GVC to put in “its best bid” over the weekend and said it would give 888 the chance to respond. \n“They are trying to get the very best price and that is their job,” says Mr Alexander at GVC. “We have made them an offer that is 20 per cent higher than 888’s. I am sure they are going to keep asking for more money.” \nGVC has so far spent €3.8m on its bid and Mr Alexander says he does not intend to lose the deal. \n“I have a plan B but I have not even thought about what would happen if we lose because I do not expect to,” he says. \nWhether Bwin is using GVC’s interest to bluff 888 into sweetening its bid, or whether it really will recommend an offer from GVC, will become clear on Tuesday, when Bwin has promised to update the market. \nBut with the stakes this high, who can afford to blink over the weekend?
