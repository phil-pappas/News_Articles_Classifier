Our 16 Ronald McDonald Houses provide a home away from home for families whose children are receiving lifesaving treatment at nearby hospitals, and we have several other essential programs, so we are very grateful for this support,” Mr Coutts said.\n“The funds raised by the appeal will go to Ronald McDonald House Charities’ national programs, including Ronald McDonald House Randwick to assist with the upgrade of the family ‘rest and reflect’ area.\n“We’d like to thank Sydney Airport for choosing us as their 2015 charity partner and we look forward to working together to raise much needed funds for seriously ill children and families during the festive season.”\nLast year’s Sydney Airport Community Christmas Giving Appeal raised a record $263,000 for charity. The 2015 appeal will be launched at the airport in November and run for the six weeks leading up to Christmas Day, with events, entertainment, activations, decorations, promotions and retailer engagement.\nRonald McDonald House Charities was chosen as the charity partner for the appeal following a successful tender process and is an independent, not-for-profit organisation that provides a range of services and support to seriously ill children and their families when they need it most. One in eight Australians has been helped by the charity or knows someone who has benefited from one of their programs.\nIn 2014, Sydney Airport invested close to $1.5 million in the local community, across charities, schools, sporting clubs and other community organisations.\nSource:- Sydney Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T03:01:22.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
