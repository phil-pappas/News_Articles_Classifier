The constant buzzing, clicking, chirping and occasional squawking, not to mention the rustle of leaves hinting at something larger lurking in the shrubbery.\nI’m not sure why I expected silence in the middle of the jungle but the noise never stops.\nNot all that surprising when you think about it. This is a land with 30 million people, and many, many more millions of animals, birds and, oh yes, insects.\nBeing so close to nature, even the creepy-crawly kind, is what makes the 13-hour flight to Malaysia so worth it.\nThe country is split into two parts, with the capital Kuala Lumpur in Peninsular Malaysia and the eastern part taking up a quarter of the island of Borneo.\nAfter a two-night stopover in KL (as everyone calls the city), we swapped the traffic jams for the slow jungle lane.\nThe five-star Mulu Marriott Resort & Spa is surrounded on every side by the forests of the Gunung Mulu National Park, slap bang in the centre of Malaysian Borneo. The only way in and out of town is by a (very small) plane, and with only a few tourists, you really do feel like you’re experiencing unspoiled nature.\nThe adventurous can climb the famous Pinnacles, spectacular razor-sharp limestone spikes reaching 130-165ft out of the rainforest. Be prepared though, it can be done only on a three-day, two-night tour. If that seems a little too adventurous, just yards from the hotel entrance you can climb the hill to a viewpoint across the entire valley and mountain ranges. The views are spectacular.\nIf even that sounds too taxing, the pool has big beds where you can relax and enjoy the sunshine. A restaurant is only a few steps away, in case you get peckish after all that exercise.\nAt night you can enjoy a drink in the open-air bar as bats flap among the rafters above.\nThe bedrooms are large and beautiful, each with a huge bathroom and private balcony. It was the perfect place to watch one of the torrential downpours that come with temperatures that rarely dip below the mid-30s.\nWIldlife: An Asian sun bear\nEarly on our second morning we set off with our brilliant guide Maria to explore further into the jungle. Arriving at the Mulu Caves, well inside the national park, we walked over a wobbly rope-bridge to what felt like entering another world.\nThe show caves, part of the Mulu World Heritage Area, are rightly famous.\nIt can take around 90 minutes to get to the Deer and Lang Caves along a wooden walkway, but there’s plenty to see on the way – trees so wide they’re the size of a small house and lots of wildlife spotting opportunities.\nWhile the greenery echoes with the sound of thousands of animals, you can’t help being slightly glad you don’t run into some of them – especially when you come across signs about, erm, bears!\nOk, they’re sun bears and not likely to be life-threatening, but still...\nThe larger creatures might be elusive but smaller species are everywhere.\nYes, there are snakes – though thankfully I didn’t see any. There are a LOT of spiders, but there are also many less scary critters – from lizards running along the handrails to butterflies fluttering and occasionally settling on you.\nBut, as Maria explained, there is one thing which draws tourists from miles around to these caves.\nSurely it’s the orangutans?\nNope, it’s the bats. Not just a couple of bats – no, this time we’re talking an estimated 2.5-3.5 million of them.\nMost nights as dusk falls, the bats – 12 different species including wrinkle-lipped bats – begin their hunt for food.\nFirst just a few scout the area looking for predators, and then the real exodus begins. Stream after stream flow from the cave, resembling dancing ribbons – swirling, looping and diving as if taking part in a choreographed dance.\nThe stream appears never-ending. Every time you think there can’t possibly be any more bats left, another few thousand soar out.\nIt’s an amazing spectacle, like nothing I’ve ever seen. Even if you’re not keen on our leathery friends, it’s a vision not to be missed.\nThe caves themselves are a sight to behold too. Huge caverns stretching back into complete darkness. You need a torch – and a guide. The bright greenery of the entrance gives way to solid rock and trickling water.\nSunset: Claire in Borneo\nA word of warning, be careful where you put your hands on the rails. Those creepy-crawlies really do get everywhere. But the prospect of a few bugs shouldn’t put you off. The stalactites and stalagmites create incredible rock formations which simply must not be missed.\nYou might even spot Abraham Lincoln’s profile in the rock face.\nBack at the hotel, the perfect end to a day of trekking through the caves is to treat yourself to a foot massage in the spa. You’ll go from “I’m never going to be able to walk tomorrow” to “anyone for a hike?” in no time.\nAnd if you want to test your resilience the next morning, you can visit the Clearwater Cave and Cave of the Winds.\nBear in mind there are one or two steps to get up there – Ok, there are actually 200.\nThen again, it’s just another excuse for a restorative massage.\nThe following day, just a short flight north to Kota Kinabalu, we settled into the truly extraordinary Shangri-la Tanjung Aru Resort.\nRight on the beach, it has probably the most amazing setting for a spa I’ve ever come across.\nEach treatment room is in its own little bungalow, all set on a mini island just off the beach.\nSuitably relaxed after a wonderful massage at Chi the Spa, the ideal way to end your day is with a cocktail or two at the hotel’s outdoor bar – also on its own little island – as you watch the sun set.\nJust a few miles away, across the South China Sea, the five islands of the Tunku Abdul Rahman Marine Park give you a chance to laze on the beach, snorkel over the coral reefs and, if you’re feeling brave, try the Coral Flyer zipline between two of the islands. I found it lots of fun and actually not as scary as I’d feared.\nAfter five days of nature, relaxation and a brief adrenaline rush, Borneo had lived up to my every expectation... except one. Where were the orangutans?\nDetermined to catch a glimpse of at least one, we headed a little further north to the Shangri-La’s other hotel in the area, the Rasa Ria Resort.\nStaying in the incredible Ocean Wing, we found our rooms came with a private balcony, complete with huge outdoor bath for two.\nBut the hotel’s unique selling point is its nature reserve – and the orangutans that live there.\nClimbing up to the viewing platform, we desperately hoped the famous residents would make an appearance. As we got closer to the top, a loud cracking sound came from the tree above.\nTwo playful orangutans had decided to say hello by throwing sticks at us.\nIt was to be the start of an incredible half-hour watching as they carried out what looked like yoga moves, enjoyed their breakfast and generally larked around, clinging to branches and ropes, before finally swinging off through the trees.\nWith that final tick on my Borneo wish list, there was just time to relax on my balcony and watch a final sunset before returning home to real life.\nThe rhythmic sounds of the jungle had soothed away any stresses and given me a feeling of perfect peace – if not quiet...\nGet there Rooms at the Shangri-La Rasa Ria in Kota Kinabalu start at around £144pn B&B.\nRooms at the Shangri-la Tanjung Aru Resort start at around £165pn B&B. shangri-la.com\nRooms at the Mulu Marriott Resort & Spa start at around £99pn h/b inc guided tours to Deer & Lang Cave, bat watching and airport pick-up and transfer for 2 people. marriott.co.uk\nMalaysia Airlines offers a twice daily non-stop A380 superjumbo link between the UK and Kuala Lumpur with frequent onward connections to destinations across Malaysia, Asia and Australasia.
