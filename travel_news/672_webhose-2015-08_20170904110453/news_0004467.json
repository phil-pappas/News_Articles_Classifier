This financial year, Dayson has seen a 40% boost in business, recording an increase of more than £250,000 worth of bookings year on year since April 1. \nHe added that while the agency had previously been known for its long-haul offering, the arrival of two new members of staff had enabled it to expand, bringing the total number of in-shop staff to six, alongside two homeworkers. \nDayson said this had allowed the business to focus on introducing high-end, short-haul product while tailor-made itineraries meant customers were less likely to find the same product online but at a cheaper price. \n“You sometimes think you can’t lose certain members of staff - and then we had a total change of staff and it gave us a wider group of customers,” he said. \n“It could be short-haul and it could be [a holiday] in Italy or Spain, but it is still good quality - it is the top-end market. \n“We’ve also concentrated very much on customer service; we’re talking to people constantly via email and social media.” \nDayson added that the agency had also shifted its focus to concentrate on supporting independent tour operators. \n“We are not going to sell Thomson any more,” he said. “It is not worth the hassle and we’re trying to support the independent operators.” \nHe said much of this was done by using operator partners from the Elite consortium, of which the agency is a member, and Aito members that Dayson knows from his past experience. \n“We used to be in Aito agents and we came out, but it is Aito members that we are continuing to support,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:53:08.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
