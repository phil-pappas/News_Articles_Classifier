Local hospitals are receiving massive numbers of people at this time in Tanjin, China. \nThe area around the harbor is sealed off. Only emergency vehicles are rushing in and out. No one, including media, is allowed to get in. \nIt happened shortly after midnight Thursday early morning in this large Chinese port city. \nLocal China Xinhua News ‏reports, the Tianjin explosion was caused by flammables & explosives at the container terminal. China Xinhua News confirms hundreds of people have been hospitalized. \nTianjin is a major port city in northeastern China. Following the 1858 Treaties of Tianjin, several Western nations established concessions in Tianjin. The European-style houses, municipal buildings and churches in Wudadao (Five Great Avenues) and the surrounding historic districts are legacies of that period. Standing in contrast are the city’s many modern skyscrapers, including the iconic 415m-tall Tianjin Radio and Television Tower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T22:45:49.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
