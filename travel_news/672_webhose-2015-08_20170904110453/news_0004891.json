My husband, who is a born-and-bred Torontonian, was homesick and I was ready for a change, so we moved in June 2014 and have been in Toronto for more than a year now. \nWhat do you do there? I work for the Ontario public service, which is the provincial government. Reuters \nToronto is a biker's paradise. \nWhat do you do with your spare time? We spend our weekends riding around the city exploring different areas and neighbourhoods. Toronto has a vast system of parks and reserves that are great for biking and walking. Also we try to take in as much as we can in terms of specific events – we went to a pow-wow to honour the Pan Am athletes. \nWhat are the greatest advantages to living there? We ended up living in one of the best neighbourhoods in the city, which was voted the second coolest neighbourhood in the world by Vogue magazine. And it lives up to that reputation with a never-ending string of bars and cafes that cater to all tastes and imagination. Toronto is known as the most culturally diverse city in the world –it's like having many countries on your doorstep including Little Portugal, Little Italy, China Town and more. \nDisadvantages? It is a big city and while people are polite, they are not overly friendly. Reuters \nNiagara Falls is just an hour's drive away. \nHow expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is beer? On an average fortnightly grocery shop we spend around $100 less on food. Eating out can be expensive, especially when tipping 15-18 per cent. I've found alcohol cheaper here, but Toronto is controlled by a licensing trust so the liquor control board of Ontario is the only place to buy alcohol, which can be a bit limiting. \nWhat's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? Poutine is a true Canadian fast food and it's actually OK, although fries, cheese curd and gravy is not overly healthy. Because of the cultural diversity you can find any food you want at any time of the day or night. \nEasiest way to get around? Torontonians complain about the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) but it's actually not bad. There's a subway train every two minutes but the streetcars can be a bit erratic, especially in the winter when the old streetcars can't cope with the cold. You can bike everywhere. It's flat and they are increasing the cycle lanes wherever possible. Tell us your Expat Tale Share your stories, photos and videos. \nWhat's the shopping like? Ad Feedback \nBest after-dark activity? Nuit Blanche happens in early October – from sunset to sunrise there are art installations all over the CBD. \nBest time of the year to visit? The summer: June-August, or if you want to take in the Toronto Film Festival in September, it's well worth it. Be prepared for high humidity such as what you would experience in the Pacific Islands. \nWhat are the top three things you recommend for visitors? Niagara Falls is only about an hour's drive from Toronto and well worth seeing. If you are here in August, the Caribbean Carnival is also well worth seeing. Do the bus tour around the city as you get to see some great places, including some cool architecture, and you can jump off any time and do some exploring. \nBesides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? Good coffee. I was out with another Kiwi the other night and she started talking about peanut slabs and feijoas, which I hadn't thought about until she mentioned them. Still waiting for someone to send me the new Whittaker's Jelly Tip chocolate. \nHow easy is it for you to get back to NZ? It's not so easy, but I think Kiwis accept that when you move to the northern hemisphere, going home isn't going to be that easy. \nFor Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? The job market is not great – the unemployment rate is 7.9 per cent and recently some big retail chains like Target have shut their doors in Canada. Take advantage of every networking opportunity you get and if you have contacts here, then use them. \nIf you know an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home, email escape@star-times.co.nz with Expat as the subject. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T06:01:52.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
