Picture: Belfast Telegraph Source: Supplied \nA PASSENGER has been tasered and kicked off a plane following a luggage dispute. \nStaff from budget airline EasyJet called the police to London’s Gatwick Airport to deal with the man who had allegedly became irate after refusing to part with his man bag. \nThe man bag had tipped him over the limit of allowable luggage items on-board, but when called out over it he allegedly became aggressive and refused to part with it. \n“Total chaos broke out when the man became confrontational,” a witness told the Belfast Telegraph. \n“When the police came on board and tasered him there were children crying and a lot of panic among passengers.” \nOther passengers took to social media to share their disbelief.

A man has been arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace. \n“The aircraft has been disembarked and police are taking statements from witnesses among the crew and passengers.” \nAn EasyJet spokeswoman confirmed the incident and said such behaviour is not acceptable. \n“EasyJet’s cabin crew are highly trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. \n“Whilst such incidents are rare we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution.” \nThe flight, to Belfast International Airport, was delayed by almost three hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T11:39:17.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
