The staged rollout is designed to transform the passenger experience, offering travellers an extensive selection of different food choices across a range of categories, including fast and fresh, gourmet and street food.\nPerhaps best known for his past gourmet ventures including award-winning restaurant Assiette and District Dining, chef Warren Turnbull created Chur Burger in 2012 after deciding to turn his hand to a more casual dining approach. What followed was almost overnight success with Chur Burger named „best burger‟ in The Sydney Morning Herald’s Good Food section in 2012.\nChur Burger is managed by SSP, the food travel experts delivering world-class food and beverage experiences in Sydney since 2008.\n“We are delighted to partner with Sydney Airport and launch Chur Burger into the T2 terminal. We hope passengers travelling domestically are just as excited as we are about this new and unique offering in the new T2 casual dining precinct,” CEO SSP Asia Pacific Chris Rayner said.\nSydney Airport General Manager Retail Glyn Williams said the airport was focused on providing more choice and greater value to passengers at T2.\n“We‟ve completely overhauled the T2 casual dining space in line with our objective to transform the airport experience at Sydney Airport. The new space will accommodate a greater number of travellers through an expanded seating area and the exciting range of new food partners we‟ve selected will complement our existing providers in T2 such as Brasserie Bread, MoVida and Toby‟s Estate,” Mr Williams said.\n“The new precinct follows a similar approach to our improvements in the T1 International terminal, providing on-trend, gourmet food selections such as Chur Burger across a range of cuisines that suit the needs of the busy domestic traveller.”\nSource:- Sydney Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:14:33.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
