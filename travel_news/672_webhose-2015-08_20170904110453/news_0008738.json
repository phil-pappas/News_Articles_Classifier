TAP has decided to back some initiatives, such as the GAP Year competition and has just announced the latest winners at its offices in Lisbon airport.\nTamára Brandão and João Amorim from São João da Madeira have won the GAP Year competition sponsored by the Lapa do Lopo Foundation and TAP and promoted by the GAP Year Portugal association that helps young people take a sabbatical year to promote their personal, academic and professional development. The competition received around 400 entries, and our two young winners received €6,500 and return travel so that they can take a year out of their studies. The GAP Year Portugal association encourages young people to leave their comfort zone, travel and volunteer or work abroad.\nThe two winners, aged 22 and 23, will visit 14 countries, including Argentina and Mexico, and will work as volunteers for a month at an environmental association and with an organisation that helps teach children. They are also going to use the time to learn Spanish, surf and cook, while working in exchange for board and lodgings.\nTheir project stood out because of many different activities they have planned, the expected impact on the personal development of these young people who were not thought to have the best prospects for entering the job market, the good example they set for other Portuguese young people and because they proposed spending only €3,000 each on this great adventure.\nSource:- Tap Portugal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T07:50:19.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
