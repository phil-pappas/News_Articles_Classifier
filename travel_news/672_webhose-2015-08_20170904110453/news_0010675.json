Get stuck in at the Kings Park Festival ( bgpa.wa.gov.au ), at Kings Park and Botanic Gardens (1) in September. It hosts live jazz, gardening workshops, indigenous dances and more markets than you can shake an Aussie dollar at.\nTouch down \nI travelled with Etihad Airways (0345 608 1225; etihad.com ), which flies from Heathrow, via Abu Dhabi (returns from £644 on economy and £2,891 on business class). Manchester and a new Edinburgh route start at £647. Perth is also served by Singapore Airlines (0844 800 2380; singaporeair.com ) from Heathrow via Singapore; Qatar Airways (0844 846 8380; qatarairways.com ) from Heathrow and Manchester via Doha; Emirates (0844 800 2777; emirates.com ) from a range of UK airports via Dubai; Malaysia Airlines (0871 423 9090; malaysiaairlines.com ) from Heathrow via Kuala Lumpur; and Cathay Pacific (020 8834 8888; cathaypacific.com ) from Heathrow via Hong Kong.\nUK nationals should apply in advance for a free eVisitor visa from the Department of Immigration & Border Protection ( border.gov.au ).\nThe airport is 17km south of the centre. Free, 24-hour transfer buses run from Terminal 1 to T3 where you can catch the Connect airport shuttle ( perthairportconnect.com.au ) to five city centre locations. Buses depart every 10 minutes; tickets cost A$15 (£7) one-way and can be bought from the driver. Taxis are plentiful and a ride to central Perth costs around A$40 (£19).\nGet your bearings \nThe Connect shuttle's second drop-off is outside the WA Museum (2) on Beaufort Street, which borders the up-and-coming Northbridge area – a warren of bars and restaurants.\nTo the west are Kings Park (1) and the suburb of Fremantle, while South Perth is beyond the mighty Swan River, but just five minutes by ferry from Barrack Street Jetty (3). Four free CAT bus routes ( transperth.wa.gov.au ) cross the centre, and Transperth buses and trains are free within the Free Transit Zone (FTZ).\nThere's a Western Australia Visitor Centre (4) at 55 William Street (00 61 8 9483 1111; Monday to Thursday, 9am to 5.30pm, Saturday 9.30am to 4.30pm, Sunday 11am to 4.30pm). I-City volunteers, with blue and green-sleeved shirts are on the streets to help and they also staff an information kiosk in the Murray Street Mall (5).\nCheck in \nOne of Perth's oldest buildings, the 135 year-old Treasury (6) at 1 Cathedral Avenue (00 61 2 9331 2670; comohotels.com/thetreasury ) has been turned into 48 luxury suites – opening 15 October – with a spa and glass-encased restaurant/bar with river views. Doubles from A$595 (£282), with breakfast.\nThe Alex Hotel (7) at 50 James Street (00 61 8 6430 4000; alexhotel.com.au ) is a 74-room boutique option in Northbridge with a roof terrace and free bicycles. Doubles from A$200 (£94), with breakfast and locally roasted coffee.\nBudget travellers can book a cell at the Fremantle Prison YHA at 6A The Terrace (00 61 8 94 33 4305; yha.com.au ). Just a half-hour from the city centre, this heritage-listed, 19th-century prison housed inmates up to 1991. Twin rooms are A$68 (£32) a night, room only.\nTake a view \nEast of the hospital on Mount Bay Road is a series of 242 concrete steps known as Jacob's Ladder (8) that twist upwards through parkland to Cliff Street. Huff and puff to the top to be rewarded with top-notch views of the city skyline and Swan River. Stand to the side to let sweaty joggers pass you by.\nClick here to see a bigger image of the map \nDay one \nTake a hike \nFrom the top of Jacob's Ladder (8) walk north to Harbour Town station (9) and ride the free yellow CAT bus east to Victoria Gardens (10). From there, you can pick up a 2.3km walking trail that loops around Claisebrook Cove – a former industrial area turned well-heeled district studded with artwork such as Sea Queen and Standing Figure (11), an old river boat found and restored by artist Toby Jones and moored on the cove's north side. The path loops around leafy Mardalup Park (12), with river views, then across Trafalgar Bridge (13) and back to Victoria Gardens (10).\nLunch on the run \nPop into the open-air City Farm Café (14) at 1 City Farm Place in East Perth (00 61 8 9221 7300; cityfarmcafe.com.au ), a family business that gets its produce from Perth City Farm. It serves gourmet sandwiches, quiches and soups, as well as organic coffee from Northbridge City Roasters.\nWindow shopping \nCapitalise on the favourable dollar-to-pound conversion rate and save a few pennies when buying a Prada purse on King Street (15), where all the haute-couture designers have shop fronts and the pavement is studded with fashion \"walk of fame\" plaques. For reasonably priced threads, head round the corner to Gorman (16) – a celebrated Australian fashion label – at 100 St Georges Terrace (00 61 9481 5970; gormanshop.com.au ), or walk 12 minutes north to riffle through the racks of Ruck Rover General Store (17) at 242 William Street (00 61 8 9228 3502; ruckrover.com.au ). It is owned by sisters Claire and Isabelle Trolio and has a hand-picked collection of trinkets and clothes from both local and national designers.\nAn aperitif \nJoin the Two Feet and a Heartbeat Small Bars Tour (00 61 800 459 388; twofeet.com.au ) run by Ryan Zaknich, whose mother inspired the company name when he asked her for a lift into town and she replied: \"Get nicked – you've got two feet and a heartbeat!\" A three-hour tour costs A$50 (£26) per person with a short city history, plus grazing food and drinks in three up-and-coming bars including the independent Choo Choo's (18) (00 61 449 699 342; choochoosbar.com ), a hip basement joint with graffitied walls.\nDining with the locals \nThe award-winning Trustee (19) at 133 St Georges Terrace (00 61 8 6323 3000; thetrustee.com.au ) is the current go-to place for a posh meal. Start with the kangaroo carpaccio, then try the marron – locally farmed freshwater crayfish – served with lemon risotto. Above all, be sure to leave room for its famed homemade Snickers bar and salted caramel ice cream dessert – there are no words!\nFit for royalty: the designer shops of King Street Day two \nSunday morning: go to church \nSurrounded by skyscrapers, the 19th-century St George's Anglican Cathedral (20) at 38 St Georges Terrace (00 61 8 9325 5766; perthcathedral.org ) is a welcome reminder of old Perth. It was built from handmade red bricks and is renowned for its bells, which peal on Sundays at 10am before Eucharist and were forged in memory of Queen Victoria when she died in 1901.\nOut to brunch \nCatch a taxi west to Piccolo's Corner (21) at 58 St Leonards Avenue – a well-kept local secret largely because there's no phone number or website. Open 8am to 2pm on Sundays, this artsy, family-run café-shop serves scrumptious cooked breakfasts and organic smoothies. Cash only.\nA walk in the park \nKings Park's Botanic Garden (1) marks its 50th anniversary this year and gives excellent city views. Go solo and follow the Boodja Gnarning trail, or learn about bush medicine and the Dreamtime on a 90-minute tour with an aboriginal guide. These depart from Wadjuk car park Monday to Friday, 1.30 to 3pm and 3.30 to 5pm and must be booked via Indigenous Tours (00 61 405 630 606; indigenouswa.com ). Adults A$50 (£23), children A$15 (£7).\nTake a ride \nTake to two (electric) wheels and explore the banks of the Swan River with Segway Tours WA (00 61 8 932 55790; segwaytourswa.com.au ), which has three routes – East and West Foreshore Tours, and the Riverside Tour. They range from an hour to 90 minutes and cost A$89-129 (£42-60), departing from Barrack Street Jetty (3) daily, 9am to 5pm (see website for times).\nCultural afternoon \nTwenty minutes by taxi to the north is Malaga, a suburb with a not-for-profit Native Animal Rescue centre (22) at 170 Camboon Road (00 61 8 9249 3434; nativeanimalrescue.org.au ). It's dedica- ted to the rehabilitation of sick, injured, orphaned and displaced native animals. For a A$25 (£11) membership, day visitors can help out and handle some species.\nIcing on the cake \nWander down Wolf Lane (23) in the CBD. Once the city's communal stables, in five years it has reinvented itself, and now amid the graffitied walls are espresso bars and the tapas joint Bar de Halcyon (00 61 8 9226 3189; bardehalcyon.com.au ). Keep an eye out for Crazy Uncle Moonshine – a locally distilled whisky.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T18:57:55.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
