The rebranding comes three years after the Santiago-based company, formerly known as LAN Airlines, merged with Brazil's TAM to create the region's largest airline.\nThe unified brand will begin to be physically visible on planes and other areas from next year and the whole process will take around three years to complete, the company said in a statement.\nThe move to create a unified, global brand instead of two strong domestic brands underscores a growing industry focus on international tourism to offset softer domestic demand in the region.\nLATAM's Brazilian division TAM announced last month that it would reduce domestic capacity by 8-10 percent and rival carrier Gol said it would reduce frequencies by 1.6 percent in the second half of the year.\nLATAM also has LAN subsidiaries in Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador, which will be folded into the LATAM brand.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:57:15.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
