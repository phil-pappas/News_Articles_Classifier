The tour group revealed more details of the attack in a statement late Tuesday.\n\"Having been thrown to the ground, bitten in the shoulder and neck Quinn sadly died at the scene, the shouting of his guests driving the lion away from his body and allowing, ultimately unsuccessfully, emergency first aid to be performed,\" the statement said.\nThe 40-year-old guide was \"fully qualified and very experienced,\" Camp Hwange said. On a guided walking tour on Monday, he followed lion tracks that led to a pride. An adult male rose and began walking toward the group. Swales instructed the tourists to get behind him and stand still, according to the firm.\nAt first the lion did not charge. As it came closer, Swales and the tourists shouted to intimidate it. The lion seemed to return to its pride, but suddenly charged toward the group, attacking Swales, the tour group said.\nHwange park was once home to Cecil, a lion controversially killed by an American trophy hunter in July, sparking international outrage.\nLike Cecil, the attacking lion named Nxaha, wears a satellite collar installed by wildlife researchers.\nZimbabwe's National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority will decide the lion's future after an investigation.\nThe attack has not affected the popularity of walking tours through Zimbabwe's wildlife parks, a safari operator said.\n\"It's a safe experience and a great experience too. It's not as if these attacks happen daily,\" said Trevor Lane, a member of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe. \"It was an accident and we are still recording huge interest from tourists. It's popular and will remain so.\"\nBut tourists must be warned of the potential risks of guided walks, said police spokeswoman Charity Charamba.\n\"Tracking these animals on foot on their habitat may seem fun but it is dangerous, very dangerous,\" she said, adding that villagers living near parks were also attacked by wild animals.\n\"People should never forget that these are wild animals,\" she said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:12:59.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
