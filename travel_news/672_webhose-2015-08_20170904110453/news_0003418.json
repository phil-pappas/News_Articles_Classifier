Graham IV, FASAE, CAE. “This will provide Abila a great opportunity to raise awareness with our association members and provide advice on new ideas as well as strategies on how to increase member engagement.”\nThe Alliance Partnership Program was developed to provide the industry partner community with opportunities to align itself with ASAE and the association sector through customized marketing platforms. It also offers partners the chance to help build and maintain year-round relationships with ASAE members and nonprofit communities worldwide.\n“The ever-intensifying competition for members’ attention and dollars has led to a more complex world for association executives with the expansion of non-traditional revenue streams, new membership models, and a greater emphasis on the customer experience,” said Krista Endsley, CEO of Abila. “We’re looking forward to collaborating with ASAE and its members to help associations get the most out of their engagement efforts and technology, as they adapt to provide more value in response to the shifting needs of the membership.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:39:17.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
