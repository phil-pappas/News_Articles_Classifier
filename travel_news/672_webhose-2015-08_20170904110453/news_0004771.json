As news of the shocking devastation spread, it became clear that tourists were the targets of the murderous attack. These are some of the questions posed by readers in the aftermath of the atrocity.\nQ) How many British travellers are in Thailand, and what is happening to them? \nFrom the available sources, I calculate around 30,000 British holidaymakers are in Thailand. August and September are the wettest months in much of the country, which is why this is a relatively low figure; most of the 900,000 UK tourists to the country visit in winter, when the weather is more benign.\nLive updates following the Bangkok bombing Apart from the area in the immediate vicinity of the attack in Bangkok, life for tourists in Thailand continues more or less as normal. Having said that, the Thai government’s response to the atrocity in the capital is likely to affect all visitors. They can expect heightened security at transport terminals, especially the airport, the railway station and the bus stations in the capital. There is likely to be a more visible security presence in the Khao San Road (the street at the heart of the backpacker community) and other places where Westerners tend to congregate.\nSecurity checks of travellers and their baggage on buses to and from places such as Phuket and Chiang Mai could become more frequent and intensive.\nQ) We are due to travel to Thailand in six weeks, flying initially to Bangkok. What is your feeling on travel there? \nEven before the Bangkok attack, the Foreign Office warned of a high threat of terrorism in Thailand. There has been a long-standing insurgency in four provinces in the deep, troubled south of Thailand, and the FCO advises against all but essential travel to the provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Songkhla on the Thai-Malaysia border. It says: “Since 2004, there have been almost daily attacks in the far south of the country, including arson, bombings and shootings.”\nIn Bangkok in February, two small bombs were detonated close to the Siam Paragon Shopping Mall in Bangkok. And in April, a car bomb exploded in an underground car park on the beach resort island of Koh Samui. Seven people were injured, including one foreigner.\nThe latest attack was of a much more severe order of magnitude. But statistically, the risk for any individual traveller of being caught up in a murderous attack remains very low. The rewards remain as they have done for years: the chance to meet friendly people in a beautiful country that has a rich culture, great cuisine, fascinating trekking and blissful beach life. I would have no hesitation travelling to Bangkok or any of the usual tourist spots in Thailand.\nQ My daughter has just started her gap year, and is due to arrive in Bangkok in the next few days. Should I ask her to bypass the city, or the whole country? \nI believe she can continue with her plans without taking a significant risk. The main threats to young British travellers to Thailand remain the same as ever: being involved in road accidents, and accidents in water. If she is on a typical gap-year ticket, such as a round-the-world itinerary, any change to destinations is likely to prove expensive or impossible - though date alterations are normal allowed for a fee.\nYou might want to reminder her that busy bars and hotel lobbies have been targets of previous attacks in other parts of the world, and suggest she bears this in mind when out and about.\nQ We booked a trip to Thailand, and paid a deposit of £1,000, the day before the bombing. We heard about it within 24 hours, and immediately tried to cancel - but the holiday company refused. What are our rights if we decide not to travel? \nNormal terms and conditions apply for anyone with an advance booking to Thailand. It looks as though the firm you booked with insists the deposit is non-refundable. Some firms may decide to offer alternative destinations, but there is no legal obligation for them to do so. The only circumstances in which you could get your money back is if the Foreign Office advises against travel - an extremely unlikely prospect. And while some individual airlines, such as British Airways, provide customers with a 24-hour “cooling off” period, most travel companies do not.\nQ I am still going ahead with a planned three-week backpacking trip to Thailand in Will my travel insurance continue to be valid or do I need to contact the insurers? \nYou need to nothing more, so long as your travel plans do not include the four provinces in the south that the Foreign Office says are off-limits. Bear this in mind if you are planning to travel overland to Malaysia. Anyone deciding to visit these areas despite the advice would find their travel insurance invalidated. This has been a long-standing warning, and will have prevailed when you took out the policy.\nQ The Foreign Office insists that most of Thailand is still safe - but what are other governments saying? \nThe US Embassy in Bangkok quickly issued a warning to its citizens about the attack, saying: “Avoid the area and monitor local media for updates.” Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs says: “The security situation remains volatile. You should pay close attention to your personal security at all times and where possible monitor the local media, including social media, for information about possible new safety or security risks.” And the Canadian government outlines the high state of tension in Thailand that prevailed even before the bombing: “Indiscriminate attacks using explosive devices and firearms have taken place in busy public areas during the day and at night. Clashes have also occurred between pro- and anti-government demonstrators.\n“Maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times. Be aware that any public statement that is perceived to be critical of the political situation in Thailand, the National Council for Peace and Order, the Royal Thai Army, or the Monarchy could lead to detention.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T05:46:46.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
