Travel nightmare ... Every year, about 120,000 bags fail to arrive with their owners. Picture: AFP Source: Supplied \nAUSTRALIAN Airports have been urged to use technology to reduce the number of bags going astray in transit and costing airlines a fortune to track down. \nThe CAPA Aviation Summit in Sydney today heard an average of 120,000 bags a year fail to make the same trip as their owners — or one per cent of all luggage. \nMost bags that do get lost in transit belong to travellers doing international trips with connecting flights, involving multiple airlines and ground handling crews. \nExecutive Director of the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia, Barry Abrams, said it was costing airlines about $40 million a year chasing bags and connecting them with their owners. Losing a fortune ... Lost luggage is costing airports millions to track down. Picture: Supplied Source: Getty Images \nThe figure was based on an average cost of $300 to reunite each bag with travellers. \nMr Abrams said that rate could be improved with the better application of existing technology. \n“A good global benchmark is half a per cent,” Mr Abrams told the summit. \n“I think where we need to get to is a world where we’re focused on the final outcome for the passenger.” \nBetter communication was part of the challenge, as well as making more use of tracking systems for luggage, Mr Abrams said. \nBetter technology ... Brisbane Airport Corporation CEO Julieanne Alroe says more sophisticated tracking systems can help minimise the damage of lost luggage.
