In the same way that Clearing accommodates students that haven’t performed as well as they’d hoped during their exams, Adjustment makes sure overachievers are free to reconsider their options and perhaps enrol on an alternative course and/or university to their original firm choice. Although potentially beneficial to prospective students, Adjustment can appear quite daunting at times, so if you’re unsure of what to do, have a read of our guide and see how Adjustment could help you. • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android What is Adjustment? Ucas’ Adjustment process allows those of you that have done better than expected in your exams to look into attending a better university than the one you have been offered. You could also look at applying to an institution that may have previously rejected you or enrolling on a course that required grades you were not predicted to achieve, and now have. Who is able to use it? You, if you have exceeded the grade requirements for your firm university offer and are interested in setting your sights on a higher ranked establishment or more prestigious course. Do bear in mind that Adjustment is in no way obligatory. If you do better than you had hoped in your exams, but are happy with your original choice, that’s fine too. When is it? Adjustment is a five day flash in the pan, so you have to be quick. Although the Adjustment period lasts from Results Day until the 31st of August, you are only given five days to find an alternative course or university from the time you register in Track, so the quicker you are to register, the more likely you are to secure a place at a university or on a course that you want. Still, five days isn’t much time to make a massively life changing decision, so be sure to use your time wisely and think rationally; the entire aim of Adjustment is to give students the chance to enhance their university experience, not hinder it. Will I lose my current offer? No. One of the best things about Adjustment is the security it provides. If you manage to find a new university or course that you prefer, you can apply; however, if you’re unable to secure a suitable alternative within your five day Adjustment period, you'll still retain your place on your original course. How do I do it? Be sure to register for Adjustment via the Ucas Track system so universities are able view your application. Next, ring the university you’d be interested in attending (regardless of whether you have previously applied for them or not) and let them know that you’ve exceeded your expected results and are interested in enrolling with them through Adjustment. Find out if there are any available vacancies and if there are not, keep it moving- don’t be tempted to waste time on a fruitless phone call. Remember, unlike Clearing, there is no list of participating universities in Adjustment, so make sure you’re sitting comfortably as this could take a while. If you’re offered a place and are happy to take it, Ucas Track will be updated with your new university/course choice. But be aware that once your new university has put the offer into Track, your original firm choice will become null and void; there’s no going back so be sure to have a think before you commit to anything. What else? Adjustment may be an excellent option for some but an ill-suited one for others. No matter how well-prepared you may be, university still comes as a big culture shock for most, so if you’re set to undo all the planning and research you’ve done around one institution, make sure it’s a decision you won’t find yourself regretting. A university being ranked better than another in the league tables doesn’t immediately make it the better choice for you, and you’ll have to be prepared to put in the ground work when it comes to sorting out new accommodation, bursaries, grants and the like. Courses can and often do differ greatly institution to institution, so don’t bargain on switching English degrees, for example and the course exactly matching the syllabus outlined by your previously confirmed choice. Most importantly, don’t feel pressured to go into Adjustment if it isn’t for you. It can be frustrating for those who get their hopes up about attending a seemingly superior university only to be very disappointed if they don’t find what they were looking for. Imagine the prospect of swapping a very nice piece of chocolate cake for a slightly bigger one; if things don’t work out quite as you’d hoped, it doesn’t make the first slice any less sweet, does it? Take the same approach to Adjustment and if you’re going to be disappointed about anything, let it be that there’s no cake involved (Sorry).
