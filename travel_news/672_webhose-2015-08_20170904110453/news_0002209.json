With these events, we have driven forward our business, growing our ticketed revenue and profitability. We want to continue this success with a new organisational structure which focuses on greater brand differentiation and the end to end guest experience. \n“I would like to thank Gerard for his contribution and leadership. He leaves both brands well placed to meet their respective challenges over the coming years and I wish him every success in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:28:03.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
