Users pay a fee each time they send a message to a potential lover.\nThey turned down a request by The Associated Press to be interviewed for this story but have spent years appearing on TV talk shows and making other media appearances to promote their site.\nThe company says in a statement the hackers should be judged, not Ashley Madison and its roughly 39 million customers. The hackers have accused the company of filling the site with fake profiles and extorting fees for wiping profiles that were never truly deleted.\nThe company has said it is working on beefing up its security protocol.\n“Regardless of the nature of the content, our customers, this company, and its employees are all exercising their legal and individual rights, and all deserve the ability to do so unhindered by outside interference, vigilantism, selective moralizing and judgment,” the company said. “The individual or individuals who are responsible for this straightforward case of theft should be held accountable to the fullest extent of international law.”\nNoel Biderman has written books espousing his views on infidelity, including one published in 2011 entitled: “Cheaters Prosper — How Infidelity Will Save The Modern Marriage.”\n“The reader will be transported to other cultures where infidelity is rampant and yet divorce is virtually non-existent,” says the book’s promotional material.\nThat theory may be put to its biggest test yet in the aftermath of the breach. Some lawyers predict they will be flooded with business, while New York divorce attorney Michael DiFalco says he believes there will be “a dozen clients caught by text message for every client that might get caught this way.”\nThe Bidermans earned millions from running a dating service for cheaters, yet Amanda Biderman told ABC’s “The View” in 2013: “I would be devastated if (Noel Biderman) did it to me. But I would not blame a website. Ashley Madison is not creating cheaters. It is servicing a need that is there, that exists. And unfortunately, it exists. It’s sad.”\nMarriage and family therapist David Christopher of Solana Beach, Calif., said in his 25 years of counseling he has had numerous clients who have acted on such impulses in a moment of loneliness or sadness and caused a lot of pain.\nSites like Ashley Madison have capitalized on that human reality but that doesn’t make it right, he said.\n“Over the years, I’ve also known drug dealers who didn’t do the cocaine they were selling, so wouldn’t this be the same thing?” he asked.\nJULIE WATSON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:35:56.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
