It's the Solvency Issue, Stupid By William Richards | 08/13/15 - 01:00 PM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Social Security is still a pillar of the American worker’s perceived financial future, no matter the age of that worker, and living independently is the ultimate life goal that Franklin Roosevelt’s brainchild will dutifully fund. So goes the AARP’s “ Social Security 80th Anniversary Survey Report ,” whose authors breathlessly outline the octogenarian program’s value and popularity despite accusations by some presidential contenders that it represents worthless IOUs. \nBut, there’s a lot to believe in, according to Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, a senior citizen advocacy organization founded in 1982 by none other than James Roosevelt, Franklin and Eleanor’s oldest son. \n“There are some really loaded words politicians use such as ‘broke’ and ‘bankrupt,’” says Richtman, “and the only way it could be broke is if nobody contributed to it, which is just not the case. There is a long-term solvency issue. In 20 years, with no change, only 80% of benefits will be paid after 2033. We don’t want that to happen, but it is not a broke program.” \nIconic as is, Social Security is a much more varied program than the average American worker realizes, he says. And, if long term solvency is one challenge, a close second is the challenge of raising short-term awareness. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:11:47.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
