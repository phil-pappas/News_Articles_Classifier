You start imagining who they’ll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they’re gone. It’s a lonely experience. Most people don’t discuss miscarriages because you worry your problems will distance you or reflect upon you — as if you’re defective or did something to cause this. So you struggle on your own,” he said. “In today’s open and connected world, discussing these issues doesn’t distance us; it brings us together. It creates understanding and tolerance, and it gives us hope.\n“When we started talking to our friends, we realised how frequently this happened — that many people we knew had similar issues and that nearly all had healthy children after all,” he said. “We hope that sharing our experience will give more people the same hope we felt and will help more people feel comfortable sharing their stories as well.”\nZuckerberg said he is certain that the girl takes after him because the ultrasound showed the baby giving a thumbs up “like” with her hand, similar to the familiar Facebook icon.\nResemblance ... Mark Zuckerberg is convinced his daughter will take after him after she gave him a thumbs up ‘like’ in the ultrasound.
