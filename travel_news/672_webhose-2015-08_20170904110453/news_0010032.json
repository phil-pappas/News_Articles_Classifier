My 24-year-old son has a set designed for adults that he uses to explore and study some of the world’s great architecture. (I’m still waiting for him to let me play with his architecture studio set.) \nTravelers can see impressive Lego creations at many attractions around the world. The National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Va., even has a life-size Lego reproduction of the famous World War II raising of the flag on Iwo Jima. \nCloser to home, the Columbus Museum of Art, COSI and the Ohio History Connection are sponsoring a Lego Design Challenge, promoting the creative use of Lego bricks to explore transportation and architecture. \nEntries are being accepted through Sept. 21. Finalists will be exhibited at one of the partnering organizations. \nFor more information, visit www.columbusmuseum.org/lego-contest \nAnd now the world’s largest display of Lego art, with more than 100 works made with millions of Lego bricks, will be moved this fall to the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. \nContemporary artist Nathan Sawaya, who gave up a promising law career for the world of art, has created dozens of fascinating and ingenious works using only Lego bricks. One of the most famous, Yellow , a life-size depiction of a man ripping open a Lego-filled chest, is a centerpiece of the Cincinnati exhibit. \nOther works to be displayed include a 20-foot-long Tyrannosaurus skeleton and re-creations of art masterpieces such as Van Gogh’s Starry Night , all produced in Lego bricks. \nShould visitors find the works inspiring, they can create their own masterpieces using the tubs of Lego bricks available in an interactive gallery. (I think my youngest would especially like the build-it-yourself race car and racetrack.) \n“The power of Lego bricks is their versatility,” said Elizabeth Pierce, president and CEO of the Cincinnati Museum Center. \n“It’s a great medium to unleash creativity.” \nVisitors, Pierce said, will experience an immediate “wow” factor. \n“One of the first pieces you see is (a re-creation of) Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss — and there it is, in three dimensions,” she said. “(Sawaya) . . . has created the entire bodies from that painting — and the same with American Gothic . It’s cool to see those pieces from a whole new vantage point. \n“What’s also fun about Nathan’s exhibit, he re-creates pieces . . . but then also creates his own wonderful unique pieces.” \nThe Art of the Brick has appeared at museums and exhibition spaces around the world. Simultaneous exhibits of Sawaya’s work will also take place this fall in Vero Beach, Fla.; Walnut Creek, Calif.; Rome, Italy; and Sydney, Australia. \nThe Cincinnati show will open on Oct. 23 and run until May 8. Advance discounted tickets are available from the museum through Sept. 14. \nFor more information on the Cincinnati exhibit, visit www.cincymuseum.org/exhibits/art-of-the-brick .
