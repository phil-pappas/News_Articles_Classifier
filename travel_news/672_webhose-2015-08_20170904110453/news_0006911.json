The film has broken several other records, including for highest ticket sales in a single day, a single day for IMAX, opening day and opening weekend, according to data analyst Entgroup. It is now the fastest domestic film to cross the billion-yuan-mark in ticket sales, breaking the symbolic line in just eight days. According to latest data, profits from domestic films exceeded 100 million yuan ($16.1 million) for 20 days consecutively, pushing total ticket sales in July up to 5.49 billion yuan ($897.5 million) and also setting the record for the first time in monthly domestic ticket sales by making more than 500 million yuan. Media watchdog State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said on Aug 1 that box office performance in July has raised total cash so far this year to 25.9 billion yuan ($4.17 billion). Directed by Raman Hui, who also co-directed blockbuster Shrek the Third, Monster Hunt boasts high-quality computer graphics and it star-studded cast includes rising star Jing Boran, actress Bai Baihe as well as veteran actors Sandra Ng, Eric Tsang and Tang Wei. Together with the epic of monsters, Jian Bing Man and animated film Monkey King: Hero is Back are the trio winners at the box office this summer. Jian Bing Man, a parody of Hollywood superhero films, has also sold more than 1 billion yuan in tickets, while Monkey King sold 204 million yuan ($32.79 million) with 5.86 million admissions. While domestic filmmakers enjoy the sweet success of the blooming, or somewhat combusting market, Western media have expressed mixed views. Variety and Indiewire both forecasted a strong market for China's films this year. Hollywood Reporters reviewed Jian Bing Man, which opened in the US on July 24 and profited roughly $400,000 in ticket sales, as a film that attracted record audiences in China \"while only sporadically funny\" and cited differences in viewer preferences for the film's failure for translating its homegrown success to overseas audiences. For many producers, you can't go wrong with catching the interests of domestic audiences According to Bloomberg, theaters in China \"hasn't featured a Marvel superhero or dinosaurs from a revamped franchise or even an American action star\" since mid-July. \"Moratoriums on foreign productions regularly clear the release calendar of Western blockbusters so domestic films have unfettered access to audiences. And they ensure Chinese movies make up about 55 percent of the annual box office,\" reported Bloomberg in an article titled China's film industry is gaining on Hollywood. Hollywood Reporters said domestic films have benefited from \"the clear run at the box office during July because of an unofficial blackout period when big Hollywood films are put on the back burner to give domestic fare a chance to thrive.\" Filmmakers in China disagree and attribute the success of China's snowballing market to the purchasing power of audiences and better craftsmanship in filmmaking. \"For many producers, you can't go wrong with catching the interests of domestic audiences,\" said Chen Zhixi, producer of Jian Bing Man.
