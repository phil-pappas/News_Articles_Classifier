Bin Touq expects the number of operators to grow to 100 within the next three years, and to 200 within the next five years. \nHoliday homes are relatively recent additions to Dubai’s tourist accommodations, according to Rashid Abu Bakr, associate director at TRI Consulting. \n“DTCM [Dubai Tourism] started accepting registration applications from qualified operators sometime in mid-2014. With new regulations, this market is expected to grow substantially in Dubai in the future as evident from the travel trends emerging from other parts of the world,” he said. \nHe added that holiday homes in Dubai attract tourists from European, Gulf and Asian families, as well as medium to long-stay business travelers. \nThese homes see demand from Europeans, who are spending less abroad given the weaker euro against the US dollar to which the UAE dirham is pegged, and their familiarity with the concept, he said. \n“When budgets are constrained, people look at these kinds of accommodation. They are typically more affordable than hotels,” he said. \nLower residential rents in Dubai are likely to encourage more property owners to operate their properties as holiday homes, which is “subject to the licensing requirements, to accommodate short and long stay guests in a bid to boost yields,” according to Abu Bakr. \nResidential rents dropped by an average of 3 percent in June, according to a report by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) and MPM Properties. \nThe holiday homes market is regulated by Dubai Tourism. The department is responsible for approving licence applications, conducting property inspections to ensure required standards are met and creating a database of all licensed properties in the emirate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:24:51.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
