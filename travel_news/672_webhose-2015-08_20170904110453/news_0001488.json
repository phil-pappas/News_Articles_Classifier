The contest to win the palio is a horse race run in Siena's fan-shaped main square, Piazza del Campo or Il Campo . \nSiena is divided into 17 neighborhoods, or contrade , each with a rider. Ten contrade take part in the first race, July 2, chosen by a draw 20 days before the race. The other seven plus three from the July race compete August 16. Horses are assigned to the riders by a draw three days before the race. There are other events around the days of the palio, too, starting June 29 and August 13. What is a Palio? \nPeople often mistakenly believe that a palio is a horse race or that the only palio is held in Siena. In fact there are many palio contests in Italy. The palio itself is the banner won in the contest. Find out more with our palio definition . Siena's Palio Race \nRace day starts with a special mass, trial runs by the jockeys, and blessing of the horses. In the afternoon starting around 3pm there's a procession through the historic center of Siena with costumed participants from each contrada and performances by flag throwers. The historic parade ends at Piazza del Campo. \nBefore the race the starting line-up is decided by lottery and horses are lined up behind a rope, the traditional starting gate. The race is about 1000 meters total, with horses circling the track three times, taking less than two minutes. The contrada of the winning horse is awarded the palio, or victory flag. Winning the palio is a huge honor and the race is highly competitive.
