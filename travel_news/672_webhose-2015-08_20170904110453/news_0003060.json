The marker’s installation and historic text revision was sponsored by the 2015 Leadership Pendleton Class. A brief ceremony took place in front of the new marker on the eastern end of Pendleton, along Highway 30. \nOTE’s Annie von Domitz and Oregon Historical Marker Committee member George Forbes attended the dedication and were excited to be part of the efforts to update history. \n“Not only did the leadership class step up and push this project through to completion, but they succeeded in securing financial sponsorship to recreate the marker,” von Domitz said. \n“We are extremely grateful for the participation of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation,” added von Domitz. “Their contributions in correcting older marker stories are a vital component to ensuring this sign remains relevant for all members of the community.” \nMembers of the Pendleton Chamber of Commerce Ambassadors dressed in their linen cattle-drive dusters attended the ceremony. They brought along a pair of giant scissors and OTE’s Marker Program Representative Forbes held them high. \nBobbie Conner, spokesperson for the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, participated in the dedication, as did members of the leadership class.
