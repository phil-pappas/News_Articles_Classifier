I was extremely fortunate to have a job sorted before I arrived in London. Perhaps I set my sights too low but it was never my intention to get my dream job in London. \nMy purpose in coming here was to experience living overseas, to travel, enjoy art, culture and history and make the most of the many opportunities this side of the world has to offer. I viewed my job as a means to an end. Landing a London job: How did you do it? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nHaving worked in John Key's office in parliament and for the previous Speaker of the House I was lucky enough to have work experience that landed me a job at a political think tank in Westminster. \nIt may sound like the road to London was easy for me. However I had been looking for jobs in London for almost two years. I'm not much of a risk taker so I was only prepared to move if I had a job lined up. I sent more job applications than I can remember and didn't get a look in. \nAt the time I was applying the job market was rather dire in London. Also, in the UK parliament they tend to choose people with UK experience over New Zealand experience - despite the many similarities between our parliaments! I can understand this though as they want someone who can hit the ground running rather than having to get their head around the complexities of Westminster politics. \nREAD MORE: \n* Diversity drew Kiwi to Londo n \nDuring this time I was also networking like crazy and proactively making the most of the contacts I had. This eventually led me to my first London job in January 2012. \nI can't emphasise enough the importance of networking. The great thing with New Zealand's size is that we're bound to know someone who knows someone – make the most of that! But also be sure to network beyond this and think globally, which is so easy in this age of social media. Ad Feedback \nPROVE YOUR WORTH \nWhile Kiwis maintain a reputation as hard workers, in my experience we are often seen as the naïve cousins from the farthest outpost of the former empire. The topics of sheep and kiwifruit come up far too frequently! \nIt's also a highly competitive environment. Along with all the Brits, there are thousands of people from Commonwealth countries alone, all seeking the same thing us Kiwis are – a dream job to fund our exciting OE. \nSo I think it's rather naïve to assume that it will be quick and easy to find the perfect job that accurately reflects our experience and compensates us accordingly, simply by virtue of being a Kiwi. \nWe have to prove we know what we're talking about, it's not just assumed. However I have relished this. Working hard and proving our worth is part of the Kiwi DNA. \nENRICHING EXPERIENCE \nWithin the UK political scene, Kiwis are well-respected for their knowledge, perspective and work. But it's not handed to us on a silver platter. For most of us we'll have to apply for numerous jobs, recognise the value of networking and milk it for all it's worth and perhaps adjust our expectations as I did. \nAfter a year in London I moved to a public policy job. It's fast-paced, intense and incredibly rewarding. It was far easier to find work more in line with my interests and experience once I had my foot in the door and some UK experience under my belt. \nOn the one hand, living and working in London is challenging, exhausting and often frustrating (think commuting and British banking). Yet on the other hand it's rewarding, exciting and one of the most enriching experiences you can have. I cherish my time in London and know the life experience and work experience I'm getting is invaluable. \nThe assumption that you'll instantly land on your feet with the dream job is, in my opinion, unrealistic. But there are heaps of opportunities here. You just have to be patient, network like crazy and work damn hard. \nDid you land your dream job in London or was it more of a struggle than you expected?
