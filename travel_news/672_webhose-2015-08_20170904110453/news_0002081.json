The authentic Munich-style beer garden features staff in traditional costumes, vivid murals portraying scenes from Bavarian life and even a maypole. Open all year, it will be particularly lively during Oktoberfest, with music every evening from the famous Münchner Gaudiblosn band, special menus of German delicacies throughout the week, and of course plenty of beer from Erdinger, one of Germany’s most celebrated breweries. \nHighlights of the menu include the Best of Bavaria with traditional sausages and authentic accompaniments: a Bavarian Sampler with pretzels, Obazda cheese spread, cold cuts, pickles and chive bread, crunchy knuckle of pork with cabbage salad and traditional potato salad, and of course apple strudel. Staff will be on hand to explain all about the traditional delicacies, with the guarantee of best quality meat from VILA VITA Parc’s own on-site butcher. With a children’s play area also in the gardens, the festival will be a great family treat for all ages. During Oktoberfest, the VILA VITA Biergarten will be open from 1pm-10pm, with the band playing from 7pm onwards. Stay at VILA VITA Parc during Oktoberfest from £433 per room per night including taxes and fees.
