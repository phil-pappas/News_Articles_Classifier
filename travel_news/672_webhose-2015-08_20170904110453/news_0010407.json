I called his lawyer Gökhan Cindemir to learn about his condition. Cindemir confirmed the information and said Dobbousi’s skull fracture had only just been noticed,” Par reported. \nCindemir previously told Doğan News Agency that his client planned to prosecute his assailants. \n“The incident is currently the subject of a criminal investigation. We are also studying it. It might be prosecuted over deliberately causing physical injury. When reviewed closely, we may even see that it goes all the way to attempted murder,” he said on Aug. 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T23:08:33.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
