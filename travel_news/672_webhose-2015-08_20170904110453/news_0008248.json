Have a great meal at an historic guild hall. Basel Travel Information \nAfter Basel, you'll have a decision to make. You can take the Bern route and stop a few days at Stresa , on the shores of Lago Maggiore, or you can head over to Lugano in the Ticino Region of Switzerland and go on to Lake Como . \nHave more time? From the lake region on our suggested itinerary, head toward Venice with the Best of Italy's Northeast Suggested Itinerary . \nMore? Head all the way down the boot with our Venice to Sicily Itinerary . Getting to the Starting and Ending Points of our Suggested Itinerary \nIn Amsterdam, you should plan to fly into Schiphol airport . In Italy, the closest international airport is found outside of Milano, Malpensa Airport . Malpensa is very conveniently located for visitors to the lake region. I have some suggestions for staying near Malpensa . \nYou can also start in the middle of the itinerary, at Frankfurt airport . Rail Passes for the Suggested Itinerary \nSince trains in Italy are fairly cheap, you can go with a Eurail Germany-Switzerland Pass (or Eurail Germany-Switzerland Saverpass , if traveling as a family together) targeting the number of days you'll be traveling by train. I suggest Germany and Switzerland instead of Germany Benelux because you will probably only travel one day out of Amsterdam to Germany, and it's easy to buy a single ticket for that leg of the itinerary. Plus, there is a benefit to buying a pass for Switzerland--you won't have to pay in Swiss Francs, as Switzerland doesn't use the Euro. If you want a pass for all the countries on the itinerary, select the Eurail Selectpass for the number of days you will travel. \nA Eurail Saver Pass will get you 15 consecutive travel days through all the countries with few hassles. This is the best option if you decide you'd like to make side trips or day trips--to Strasbourg, France for example.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T04:39:58.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
