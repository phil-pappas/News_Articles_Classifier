The new policy \"is not unusual in the cruise industry,\" she said. \nLiquors and spirits, along with over-the-limit wine, champagne and beer will be stored until the end of the cruise. Alcohol packed in checked luggage will be removed and stored until the end of the cruise. Disney said. \nStewart Chiron, president and CEO of Miami-based industry website CruiseGuy.com, said the switch did bring DCL in line with competitors but that he didn't see this as strictly a money-making move for the company. \n\"It's not a question of Disney trying to increase liquor sales,\" Chiron said. \"Liquor sales on Disney are not on par with other cruise lines. That is not their objective.\" \nAll passengers will benefit from the streamlined boarding times created by the change, Chiron said. \nLast month, Carnival Cruise Line started prohibiting passengers from bringing bottled water, soda or other nonalcoholic drinks on board. Individuals attempted to smuggle alcohol using containers for those beverages. \nSome people \"pushed it to an extreme,\" Chiron said. \n\"You had people that were bringing on cases of water, cases of soda,\" he said. \"There really is no reason to bring on 10 cases of water.\" \nDisney Cruise Line, founded in 1998, operates four ships. The Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy vessels sail out of Port Canaveral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T01:50:28.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
