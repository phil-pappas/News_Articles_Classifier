The hotel brand teamed up with Big & Rich and awarded five of the band’s most die-hard fans the chance to “run away” with them to the Holiday Inn Resort Pensacola Beach Gulf Front for a once in a lifetime trip, which took place this past weekend.\nThe American country music duo Big Kenny and John Rich, who make up Big & Rich, are songwriters, vocalists, and guitarists, known for explosive live performances and a devoted fan base across America. The Holiday Inn Resort brand joined forces with the band as part of the Holiday Inn® Journey to Extraordinary campaign, which was launched in the summer of 2014. The campaign celebrates the incredible stories of each and every guest who walks through the doors of a Holiday Inn hotel. The Journey to Extraordinary campaign continues this year with a focus on celebrating the connections that travelers make while on the road – be they with loved ones, new acquaintances or their favorite musical duo.\nAs part of the brand’s collaboration with the band, Holiday Inn Resort is also offering more than 40,000 free downloads of Big & Rich’s new single “Run Away with You,” available for download here starting Wednesday, August 26 through Tuesday, September 22. The music video for the single, released earlier this summer, follows the story of a young couple who hit the road to see Big & Rich perform in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. From their departure from Nashville, Tennessee, to the moment they arrived at the Holiday Inn Oceanfront at Surfside Beach hotel, viewers see the special moments the couple experienced and memories they created along their journey together.\nHeather Balsley, Senior Vice President, Americas Brand Management, IHG said: “The Holiday Inn brand’s collaboration with Big & Rich embodies the spirit of the Journey to Extraordinary campaign by helping these super fans create new vacation memories while enjoying a last blast of summer fun with their favorite musicians. The lyrics of the band’s newest single, ‘Run Away with You,’ echo the sentiment of adventure and discovery that we strive to enable for our guests every day as they travel and create memories along their own journeys. Partnering with Big & Rich to create this unique experience for five of their biggest fans is just one example of how the Holiday Inn brand is connecting with our guests in new and different ways.”\nSource:-IHG", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:13:54.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
