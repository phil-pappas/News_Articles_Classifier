He also reportedly faxed a 23-page manifesto and \"suicide note\" to ABC News, describing himself as a \"human powder keg\" that was \"just waiting to go BOOM!!!!\"\nVester Lee Flanagan II, 41, who appeared on WDBJ as Bryce Williams, had evidently been planning the attack for some time, authorities said. As he fled, he switched vehicles, picking up a rental car he had previously reserved at an airport.

(Vester Lee Flanagan II/Twitter via AP) The live spot by reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward was nothing out of the ordinary: They were interviewing a local official at an outdoor shopping mall for a tourism story. Then, at about 6:45 a.m., morning show viewers saw her suddenly scream and run, crying \"Oh my God,\" as she fell. Ward fell, too, and the camera he had been holding on his shoulder captured a fleeting image of the suspect holding a handgun.\nWDBJ quickly switched back to the anchor at the station, her eyes large and jaw dropping as she said, \"OK, not sure what happened there.\" The station later went live again, reporting on their own staff as the story developed.\nParker and Ward died at the scene after the gunman fired about 15 shots. Their interview subject, Vicki Gardner, was in stable condition later Wednesday after surgery for her wounds.\nRodney Booth, of Roanoke, Va., delivers flowers to WDBJ's Digital Broadcast Center, in Roanoke, Va., after hearing news of the fatal shooting of two of the station's journalists earlier in the day, Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015. \"They're kind of like family because I see them every morning,\" said Booth. (Erica Yoon/The Roanoke Times via AP) Video posted on Bryce Williams' Twitter account and Facebook page hours later showed an outstretched arm holding the handgun. The shooter walked up to the victims and stood a few feet away, but with all three in the midst of the live TV interview, none seemed to notice. The gunman waited until Ward's camera was pointed at Parker, and then fired repeatedly.\nFlanagan was described by Jeffrey Marks, WDBJ's president and general manager as an \"an unhappy man\" and \"difficult to work with,\" always \"looking out for people to say things he could take offense to.\"\n\"Eventually after many incidents of his anger coming to the fore, we dismissed him. He did not take that well,\" Marks explained, adding that police had to escort him out of the station when he was fired.\nADDS DATE AND CITY - In this framegrab from video posted on Bryce Williams’ Twitter account and Facebook page, Williams, whose real name is Vester Lee Flanagan II, aims a gun at television reporter Alison Parker as she conducts a live on-air interview Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015 in Moneta, Va.

Parker, 24, had recently moved in with another co-worker, WDBJ anchor Christ Hurst.\nHurst wrote online that they hadn't shared their relationship publicly but \"were very much in love.\" He said they had just moved in together and wanted to get married. \"I am numb,\" he said.\nParker was raised in the Martinsville, Virginia, area and joined the station as an intern after attending James Madison University, where she was the editor of the school's newspaper, The Breeze.\nThis screen shot shows the Twitter page of Bryce Williams, whose real name is Vester Lee Flanagan II, shortly after he fatally shot WDBJ-TV cameraman Adam Ward and reporter Alison Parker during a live broadcast in Moneta, Va., early Wednesday morning, Aug. 26, 2015. The station said Flanagan was also an employee at WDBJ and appeared on air as Bryce Williams. (Twitter via AP) Others at the station said it was particularly hard for Ott, who watched the shooting unfold from the control room.\n\"Adam was our go-to guy. He pretty much was available to do anything that we asked,\" said WDBJ spokesman Mike Morgan. \"He did live shots during our morning show for several years.\"\nTweets posted on Williams' Twitter account Wednesday described workplace conflicts with both victims. They say Williams filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Parker, and that Ward had reported Williams to human resources.\nInvestigators look at the body of WDBJ-TV cameraman Adam Ward after he and reporter Alison Parker were fatally shot during an on-air interview, Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015, in Moneta, Va.

Things were spiraling out of control,\" Overton said.\nThe shooting happened around 6:45 a.m. at Bridgewater Plaza in Franklin County, as Parker interviewed Gardner about the upcoming 50th anniversary festivities for Smith Mountain Lake, a local tourism destination.\nThis undated composite photograph made available by WDBJ-TV shows reporter Alison Parker, left, and cameraman Adam Ward.
