If hotels maintain WiFi networks built primarily for laptop devices, the quality will severely suffer, particularly when guests use it while outside or while streaming platforms such as Netflix or Hulu in their rooms. \n“Not having a robust and trouble-free WiFi network will ensure guest do not return again,” said Gary Patrick, president of Hotel Internet Services and BeyondTV , Palm Harbor, FL. “Notably, 81 percent surveyed experienced poor signal coverage. \n“Guests want the same level of access that they have become accustomed to at home,” he said. “WiFi is no longer an amenity. \n“Guests want quality WiFi access throughout the property and not just in their rooms or a business center. This includes restaurants, lounges, and pool, etc.” \nDetrimental effect Problematic WiFi for smartphones and tablets may also have a detrimental effect on the slew of new mobile-first services that hotel brands are beginning to roll out. \nHotel concierge applications are becoming a must-have for major hospitality brands seeking to tap into guests’ smartphones to anticipate their needs before arrival on premises ( see story ). \nSome properties are going so far as to allow their customers to place orders for food and beverages from the hotel pool or other facilities, suggesting the WiFi must be spotless for these functions to work seamlessly. \nGuests typically use mobile devices while sunning themselves poolside \nHotel Internet Services’ study revealed that 67 percent of participants admitted they connect multiple devices to their hotel rooms’ network, with smartphones taking the top vote. \n“I think the most surprising aspect of the study was the number of devices that guest take with them and want to have them all online,” Mr. Patrick said. “Over 75 percent take smartphones, 68 percent laptops and nearly 62 percent take their tablets on the road with them. \n“Wearable technology is also starting to show its face and will make more of an impression as these devices proliferate throughout the marketplace,” he said. “Because most people are connecting with their mobile device, networks built for laptops will no longer support these devices.” \nThe rising prevalence of mobile room keys, which allow guests to unlock their rooms with their device, also lends credence to the notion that hospitality marketers should check their network structure for optimization. \nStreaming conundrums The survey also found 46.3 percent of participants claiming they stream Netflix while traveling, underscoring customers’ desire to tap entertainment platforms on their own devices or hotel televisions. \nThese subscription services enable users to save their favorite programs and offer recommendations based on previous viewing, which means that consumers can feel secure in knowing they will watch content relevant to their likes. \nMarriott International hotels will offer Netflix in-room video streaming \nMeanwhile, 37.9 percent enjoy using iTunes while traveling, with 20.7 percent skewing in favor of Google Play. This suggests that mobile users may be more likely to download travel-friendly applications during their stays, such as OpenTable or Yelp. \n“Hotels must realize that guests are demanding to have the ‘home experience’ while on the road,” Mr. Patrick said. “They are used to having high-speed Internet at home, the ability to connect easily, can stream their content, and they want that in the hotels they are staying. \n“As an example, more than half of the guests we surveyed said they wanted to stream their own content,” he said. “There is no doubt that this percentage will increase exponentially as guests have the apps and devices to make it so. \n“The room’s television is the focal point with access to content and hotel amenities including housekeeping, in-room dining, billing, checkout, etc. Look for guests desiring to stream their subscribed content to the TV substantially to the hotel’s TV.” \nFinal Take Alex Samuely is an editorial assistant on Mobile Marketer, New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T17:19:46.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
