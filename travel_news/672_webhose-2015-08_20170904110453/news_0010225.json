This is according to a study conducted by private air charter company Stratos Jets, which analyzed thousands of tourist-related tweets from across the country.\nThe company used an algorithm to assess the positive or negative sentiment ingeotagged tweets featuring the word “tourist,” then used those scores to assess the hospitality of different cities and regions.\nThe results largely accord with regional stereotypes. The Midwest appears to be the friendliest, the Northeast the nastiest, and the West Coast comes off roughly neutral. But the South is surprisingly inhospitable to tourists comparable to the Northeast.\nThe study also ranked cities on their “love” or “hate” for tourists, with Chicago emerging as the most welcoming by far. On the other hand, fanny-packed visitors should probably prepare for an icy reception in Arlington, New York, Las Vegas, Boston, and New Orleans.\nOf course, tweets are an imperfect measure of a city’s openness to tourism. Still, the raw vitriol spewed by a city’s active social media users might be a good indicator of the number of eye rolls, foot taps, and throat clearings you’re likely to elicit by fumbling for a transit pass or blocking the sidewalk in a new city.
