With the return of fall comes some of the best weather of the year, which makes this a great time to visit any number of top European destinations. In no particular order, here are 10 great spots both tried and new. \nBRUSSELS : This might just be the most under-rated city in Europe. Grand Place is the most beautiful square with fantastic, gilded buildings dating back hundreds of years. The square in front of the church of St. Catherine is more of a locals spot, but is a great place to sip a Belgian beer or nibble on those famous pommes frites or Belgian mussels. The Cathedral of Sts. Michel et Gudule is tremendous. Don’t Miss: The Magritte Museum traces the life and art work of the great Rene Magritte. \nLISBON : This is a beautiful city, with gorgeous squares and hills and winding streets and an old fort with commanding views. You’ll also find great beaches, and the water’s still nice in fall. Portugal also happens to be one of the cheaper destinations in Europe; a big help given the value of the Canadian dollar. Don’t Miss: The lovely village of Sintra features hilltop castles and fairy-tale architecture a short distance from town. \nSLOVENIA : This is a small wedge of a nation sandwiched between Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia, with elements of each. Ljubljana has a beautiful river and small hilltop castle that makes it feel like Salzburg. The river rafting is tremendous, the alpine hiking sublime and the Adriatic coast a great place to soak up the sun. Don’t Miss: A trip to Lake Bled , with its castles and glistening blue-green lake and a small island with a church. It’s as pretty a spot as you’ll find in Europe. \nWALES : Scotland and England get all the attention, but Wales is a marvelous destination. Cardiff is a fun, lively town with a cool castle. The food scene has come a long way, with tremendous local cuisine. And there’s great golf at links courses such as Nefyn and District and Royal St. David’s . Don’t Miss: The colourful coastal town of Portmeirion looks like an Italian mountain village. \nSARDINIA : Sure, there are beautiful bays in the north of the island filled with yachts owned by Europe’s pretty people. Nothing wrong with that. But you’ll also find fantastic wine, mysterious mountain peaks and endless beaches fronting clear blue Mediterranean waters. The capital city of Cagliari ain’t Rome or Florence, but it has its charms. Don’t Miss: The hike up the hill from the beach at the Hotel Calamosca is short but beautiful, with the ruins of an old Spanish fort clinging to a cliff and great views of Cagliari. \nZURICH : You’ll find narrow, winding streets in the old town with tons of sidewalk cafes and fun shops. Zurich also has a glorious lakefront, with beautiful parks and water warm enough for swimming in early fall. West Zurich features trendy restaurants and pounding, late night clubs that might surprise you. Don’t Miss: The Marc Chagall windows at Fraumunster Church . Positively glorious. \nSTOCKHOLM : Truly o Djurgarden . Don’t Miss: Gamla Stan is one of the prettiest and best preserved medieval city sections in all of Europe. \nAIX-EN-PROVENCE : Easily one of the most lovely towns in France. You’ll find small, winding streets filled with wonderful shops and nice public squares in a town founded by the Romans in 122 B.C. The farmer’s markets in this part of France are wonderful, as are the Christmas markets. And you’re only a few miles from the French Riviera. Don’t Miss: A tour of the studio used by local artist Paul Cezanne is both educational and entertaining. There’s also a lovely garden. \nPAROS : Santorini and Mykonos get the lion’s share of attention from folks heading to the Greek Islands. But Paros is a delight; small enough to be out of the way but big enough to offer a variety of activities. The beaches are marvellous and you’ll also find those gorgeous, shady streets with bright blue doors and brilliant red or pink bougainvillea. Don’t Miss: A moped ride around the island is a great way to see things on your own terms. \nKRAKOW priceoftravel.com recently found you could spen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:51:52.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
