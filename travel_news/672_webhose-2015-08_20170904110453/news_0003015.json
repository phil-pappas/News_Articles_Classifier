You'll be guided by Federica, the restaurant's chef, using the restaurant's professional kitchen to make typical Tuscan foods which could include pasta, foccacia, fish, and desserts. The menu and class are chosen based on the interest of participants. Since this is usually a private class just for your group you'll have a lot of say in what you do and be able to get hands on experience in the kitchen with plenty of attention from the chef. \nFour of my friends took a class from Chef Federica in June of 2015. For one of the couples it was their first time being in Italy and they said, \"the cooking class was a real highlight of our trip, our foodie friends will be very jealous\". They learned to clean and prepare very fresh anchovies that had just arrived on the boat that morning, make foccacia and pizza (with tips from the chef about bread making), and make homemade pasta. Of course they got to eat their finished dishes at the end of class! \nChef Federica first learned to cook in her mother's restaurant in the Garfagnana, a rural area of northern Tuscany inland from Viareggio. Her husband is a native of Viareggio and together they manage the restaurant. Being married to a local, she feel in love with the sea and its products. Cutting, slicing, and preparing fish and seafood dishes is one of her specialties. She is very passionate about baking and makes a gluten free bread. She also likes to prepare traditional dishes. How to Sign Up For and Get to the Cooking Class: \nCooking classes are held by request only since this is a restaurant rather than a cooking school and since Chef Frederica's main job is cooking for the restaurant, she prefers not to be contacted directly. Classes can be arranged through WishVersilia by filling out the form on the Tuscany cooking class page (specify Viareggio class). \nViareggio is on the rail line that runs along the west coast and on the rail line that runs to Lucca and on to Florence, making it easy to get to by train. Since the train trip from either Lucca or Pisa takes only 20 - 30 minutes, it can easily be visited as a day trip, making this cooking class convenient for those staying in Lucca , in Pisa , or in seaside towns along the Versilia Coast . \nOther foodie experiences in the area include the Vermentino Wine Tour in Versilia , the Versilia for Foodies Tour and Tuscany olive oil tours .

It was at its peak as a resort in the early to middle 20th century, but it's still a top Tuscan town for beaches, seafood, and nightlife. One of Italy's biggest and most popular carnival celebrations takes place in Viareggio and the town is famous for its carnival parades featuring huge paper mache' floats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T11:15:29.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
