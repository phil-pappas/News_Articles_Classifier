PUBLISHED: 10:27, Wed, Aug 19, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:46, Wed, Aug 19, 2015 CATERS Ronnie's Sex Shop \nRonnie's Sex Shop is a popular attraction for tourists making their way along South Africa's stunning Garden Route, and a welcome pit-stop on the remote stretch of the R62. \nThe misleading shop is actually a small bar - owned by Frank Ronald 'Ronnie' Price, the business failed to pull in the punters on such a deserted stretch of road. \nBut when his friends painted the word 'sex' on the side of the building as a joke business began to boom - and Ronnie's Sex Shop was born. Ronnie, originally from Cape Town, decided to leave the tongue-in-cheek vandalism, and word quickly spread as people flocked to see the 'sex shop'. \nNowadays Ronnie's Sex Shop attracts around 250 visitors a day despite its secluded location, and many people even fly in by helicopter to visit the popular tourist hot-spot. \nWhile some visitors expect to find a saucy sex shop after being fooled by the deceptive sign, they're not disappointed as the bar is a welcome rest-stop on the long Garden Route trip. The thousands of tourists that pass through year after year have even started a trend for leaving an impressive array of underwear, which adorn the walls and ceilings of the cosy bar. CATERS Owner and creator Ronnie Price in Ronnies Sex Shop. When I first saw the signs I thought how can a sex shop keep going out here? Chris Burton \nMany have even been signed by visitors passing through, creating the most unique guestbook ever. \nRonnie had originally planned to open a small farm shop selling fresh produce, but after the juvenile joke business began picking up and one of his friends suggested he turn the business into a bar instead. Now business is booming - there is even a souvenir shop where tourists can buy branded 'Ronnies Sex Shop' t-shirts and keepsakes. \nA simple schoolboy prank helped turn a once failing farm shop into a thriving business - proving sex really does sell. Tourist Chris Burton, 42, from Manchester, snapped these shots of the sexy shop when he was travelling from Cape Town to his sister's wedding in Oudtshoorn with his partner Louise, 32. CATERS Ronnie's sex shop \nHe said: \"We followed the Garden Route from Cape Town to Oudtshoorn and we were driving for miles and there was nothing to see except countryside - and suddenly this sex shop popped up! \"I was a bit staggered that it was there! \"When I first saw the signs I thought how can a sex shop keep going out here? Then we later realised it wasn't actually an adult store, it was a bar. \n\"On our way back from the wedding we popped in for a drink. \n\"It was just so unusual - it's in the middle of nowhere and there's just this bar with loads of tourists.
