The Aeolian and Egadi Islands offer idyllic opportunities for beach and underwater sports. \nCatania is the second largest city in Sicily whose history dates back 2700 years. It is in the list of art cities, and is named the “Land of Legends.” Simple words cannot describe the numerous treasures available also in the eastern side of this territory - rare historical testimonials, mysterious archaeological remains, and a buoyant nature. \nPicturesque and chaotic, Catania is a city where contrasts create harmony starting from the black lava stones found everywhere in the urban area, brightened by the long-lasting sunshine hours during the day. Catania is also a city where the past and modern times melt together, creating a mix of cultures that confer a pungent and modern state of life, however, with an eye to roots and traditions. Here, the loved and hated grumbling fire-spitting and sudden awakening of the Etna Vulcan that destroyed the city more than once, dominates. \nAmong the many monuments, churches, and buildings of historical importance in Catania, stands the Castle Ursino built by Frederic the II, and the fountain of the Elephant whose construction is made of lava stone. The Roman Theatre built over an earlier structure and the remains of the Amphitheatre, only a little smaller than the Rome Coliseum, both date back to the 5th century and are a must-visit. \nA walk into the past \nHere, Greek, Carthaginian, and Roman trade routes crossed; Arabs and Normans brushed shoulders; and the French and Spanish fought. All left behind remaining images mirrored in the sea: Moiza, Ortiga, Selinunte, Cefalu, and inland or on the hilltops of Erice, Segesta, Tindari, the Agrigento Valley, and Monreale. Piazza Armerina, another UNESCO site, preserves historically-valuable mosaics at the Villa del Casale (III century p.c.). It is a geometrical figure of an island and a hospitable land, an insular island where the passing of philosophers, arguments of Arab mathematicians, and baroque architecture formed a blend. \nAgrigento, (at an easy reach east of Catania) is the largest and more powerful Greek colony in Sicily whose foundation dates back to the year 581 BC. Otherwise known as The Valley of the Temples, it is a UNESCO site, and a magnificent archaeological treasure known throughout the world. Its archaeological area, the Neapolis, includes the Greek Theatre and the Roman Amphitheatre, the Latomie of Paradise (the stone caves used as prisons for the slaves), and the Ear of Dionisus, a grotto where the voice bounces back in a perfect echo. The Greek Theatre hosts interesting opera, concerts, and ballets during the summer season. The calendar of summer events is shared and alternated with that of the Greek theatre of Taormina at a reasonable distance of one from the other. \nWhere life maintains the flavor of yesterday \nHeading north of Catania it brings pleasure to bump into sea villages where life maintains the living style of the past and its flavors. It is easy to see anglers getting ready to sail on their fishing adventures or returning early in the morning with their catch. Among the most picturesque are Aci Trezza and Aci Castello, Acireale, and Santa Tecla. \nSanta Tecla is a small fishermen’s village embellished by the nearby magnificent Santa Tecla Palace Hotel. It is typical architecture for the area in the form of a six-floor building facing the Jonian gulf, surrounded by citrus olive tree yards a Mediterranean greenery, with 182 rooms in 5 categories: classic, deluxe, classic and deluxe family rooms, and suites. One bar and four restaurants, of which two are facing the sea, au par with the swimming pool. Congress and special events facilities are also available, and. Among the amenities are wellness, golf greens, a tennis court and a solarium, and sail and motor boats are available on demand. \nVIP service is provided for those who stay at the dedicated Top Executive Floor, which provides personalized check-in and check-out, room service breakfast, local specialties, sun beds in a special swimming pool and beach area, and lunch and dinner in special reserved spaces of the chosen restaurant. A dedicated staff is available on 24-hour service for information, and to book excursions or privileged seats at the Greek Theatre at Siracusa and Taormina. \nThe Santa Tecla Palace Hotel is an ideal holiday retreat close to the small art city Acireale and at easy reach of many Sicilian places of interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:11:59.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
