But now hoteliers have been empowered to eject guests they feel are being anti-social.\nScroll down for video\nThe council in Lloret de Mar have passed a law that will see misbehaving tourists kicked out of hotels\nIt is expected on check-in that all visitors will be warned that unsuitable behaviour will mean ejection. And although this has been seen as a 'last resort,' the decision is ultimately in the hands of hotel management.\nA town spokesman told The Local : 'Badly behaved tourists will not be allowed to stay at the hotel during their vacation and they will have to find another place to stay.'\n Next Stay in amazing locations around the world without paying a...

Hotels have also been told to bring in security as well as dedicated concierges, and urged that at the first sign of trouble they should call the police.\nThe coastal town of Lloret de Mar in Catalonia is one of the most popular tourist destinations on the Costa Brava.\nHowever in recent years it has become a haven for young people seeking out sun, sea and sex, and mixed with low alcohol pricing, locals have become concerned.\nLast month, MailOnline Travel reported how the Canary Islands could be off limits for many, as officials at the Spanish haven are concerned about visitor numbers and a 'Magaluf effect'.\nFernando Clavijo has been elected as the islands' new president, and it seems his first move could be to put a cap on the numbers visiting.\nMagaluf: 'We're here for a reason...to get f mortaled' Hotels in Lloret de Mar are now expected to warn tourists over their behaviour when they check-in\nAround 13million people visited the Canary Islands last year, with revenues generated from the activity contributing 30 per cent of the overall GDP.\nTenerife, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria are the largest of the 17 autonomous communities in the Spanish archipelago, popular with holidaying Britons.\nBut Clavijo believes the focus should be on how to maintain the culture and tradition of the islands, as well as tackling unemployment.\nA move to limit tourism activity has also been mooted by officials in the Balearic Islands.\nRadio Mallorca has reported that in a meeting with hoteliers, Vice President of the Government and Minister of Tourism Biel Barceló refused to rule out a cap on visitors to the islands in peak season.\n'We are all very clear that our capacity in summer is complete and we know there is a margin of two three-month off-season,' he said.\n'We cannot exert more pressure on our land and our resources in the peak months.'\nThe newly-elected president of the Canary Islands is keen to stave off a 'Magaluf effect'\nAnd in Barcelona, the new mayor-elect has announced controversial plans for a cap on the number of tourists entering the Catalan capital.\nAda Colau, who won the mayorship last month, said she plans to implement an entry cap on tourists entering the Spanish city.\n'If we don't want to end up like Venice, we will have to put some kind of limit in Barcelona,' she told El Pais newspaper in an interview. 'We can grow more but I don't know how much more.'\nRead more: Costa resort to banish the drunk and disorderly - The Local El Govern se plantea limitar el número máximo de turistas en temporada alta | Actualidad | Cadena SER", "external_links": ["http://www.thelocal.es/20150805/beach-town-to-expel-drunk-and-disorderly-tourists", "http://cadenaser.com/emisora/2015/07/13/radio_mallorca/1436785971_748004.html", "http://dailym.ai/1Mcu19O"], "published": "2015-08-06T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T03:03:55.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
