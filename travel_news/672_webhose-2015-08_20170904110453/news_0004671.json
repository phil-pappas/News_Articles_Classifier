Job growth has been comparatively weak and wages lower.\nFor example, Spokane’s recovery didn’t kick in until the spring of 2012, two years after the turnaround began here. Employment has gained traction since last summer but the latest unemployment rate for metro Spokane, in June, was 6.9 percent. By contrast, Seattle-Bellevue-Everett’s rate was 3.9 percent and the state’s 5.3 percent.\nSpokane, the state’s second-largest city, has a fairly diverse economy and improving housing sector. Comcast recently said it would build a customer-support center in the area creating 750 jobs. FedEx is spending $3.5 million to expand its distribution center in the Spokane Business & Industrial Park\n Boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert at CenturyLink But nearby Ferry, Stevens and Pend Oreille counties, heavily dependent on declining extraction industries, have some of the highest unemployment rates in the state.\nOn the other hand, Pend Oreille’s 8.6 percent unemployment is a vast improvement over the recession high of nearly 20 percent.\nStill, the legacy sectors are not quite done. Columbia Pulp said it would build a $150 million pulp mill in Dayton, Columbia County, in the southeastern corner of the state. Some 6,700 Washingtonians still work in sawmills and wood preservation, down from 10,500 in 1990.\nAs I say, this is big territory.\nIt is home to most of Washington’s agriculture, which accounted for nearly 13 percent of the state’s global exports last year. Washington was the nation’s largest <a href=\"\nhttp://www.bestapples.com/facts/facts_crop.aspx%3c/p%3e” class=”webonlylink”>apple producer</a> and the fifth largest wheat-growing state.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-1-full\" class=\"tbd-ad-place-holder-full ad right medium-rect ad-inset\"></div> This was a heartbreaking year for apple growers. Almost $100 million worth of apples were dumped into fields as compost. Growers put much of the blame on the West Coast port slowdown, a dispute between the longshore union and terminal operators.\n<div id=\"promo-left-small-mobile\" class=\"marketing-placeholder-small-mobile article-subscribe\"></div>But the problem was also linked to a record harvest and the strong dollar, which makes American exports less competitive in world markets.\nDiversification is helping balance Eastern Washington’s historical dependence on resources and commodity crops.\nThe Tri-Cities economy is bolstered by the $113.6 billion cleanup of the Hanford nuclear reservation, as well as the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.\n<a class=\"ad-continue-link\" href=\"#ad-skip-1-small-mobile\" alt=\"Continue Reading Below\"><span class=\"triangle\"></span></a> <div id=\"tbd-ad-position-1-small-mobile\" class=\"tbd-ad-placeholder-small-mobile ad right medium-rect\"></div> <a class=\"ad-continue-stub\" id=\"ad-skip-1-small-mobile\"></a>Yakima and Walla Walla have added a lucrative and growing wine industry to their agriculture portfolio.\nIn Moses Lake, where Boeing tests airplanes, <a href=\"http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/welcome-to-cyber-city-moses-lake-tries-again/\" class=\"webonlylink\">high-tech manufacturing </a>is a priority.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-2\" class=\"ad show-tablet show-desktop right medium-rect\"> <div id='div-gpt-ad-right2' class='dfp-ad dfp-right2'> <div class='ad-wrapper'> </div> </div> </div> Health services are growing in Spokane, which will become home to the new Washington State University medical school.\n<div id=\"most-read-small-mobile\" class=\"most-read-placeholder-small-mobile\"></div>WSU and Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories are a backbone of Whitman County in southeastern Washington. Its June unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.\nTourism and recreation are important economic engines in several regions beyond the Cascades.\nIn other words, inland Washington is doing fairly well when matched up against many other states. In much of the country, the story can be summed up as prosperity in the large metro areas and trouble in rural and small-town and smaller-city regions.\nThat said, Spokane is worried about the future of nearby Fairchild Air Force Base, home of the 92nd Air Refueling Wing and a provider of civilian jobs.\n“The military has started downsizing,” Forsyth, the Avista economist, told me, “and the expectation is that U.S. will have to go through a significant round of base closures in the future.”\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-3\" class=\"ad show-tablet show-desktop right medium-rect\"> <div id='div-gpt-ad-right3' class='dfp-ad dfp-right3'> <div class='ad-wrapper'> </div> </div> </div> Spokane’s health-care sector also faces challenges. “The health-care industry is a major employer in our region, and health-care reform remains a contentious political issue,” he said. “This means continued uncertainty regarding the future direction of U.S. health-care policy.”\nSpokane also lost headquarters companies in the recession, and for all the angst over Amazon, Seattle can attest to the importance of having several major corporate centers.\nAnother head wind for many rural counties is an aging population.\n“Over the next 10 years, the Office of Financial Management predicts that the share of people 65 and over in many of the Inland Northwest’s rural counties is going to increase substantially,” Forsyth said. “This demographic shift is going to put significant pressure on regional health resources.”\nThis is a broad-brush summary, but people in the Puget Sound area need to pay attention to Inland Washington.\nIts growers are intimately linked to our ports and logistics connections, such as highways and rail need improving.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-4\" class=\"ad show-tablet show-desktop right medium-rect\"> <div id='div-gpt-ad-right4' class='dfp-ad dfp-right4'> <div class='ad-wrapper'> </div> </div> </div> Also, crafting public policy is complicated by a sharp political divide in the state that mirrors what’s going on in America. Take out Seattle and a few other populous areas, and Washington would be a red state.\nVoters east of the Cascades see things differently from those in Seattle. Inland voters tend to be hostile to policies needed to help cities. City slickers need to attend to the needs of rural areas, even if the Puget Sound economy’s strength essentially subsidizes those parts of the state.\nEconomic reality doesn’t care about red and blue. What matters is how the state overall performs against its international competition.\n</div> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-facebook large\"></i></a> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-mail large\"></i></a> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-twitter large\"></i></a>\n</div>", "external_links": ["http://www.bestapples.com/facts/facts_crop.aspx%3c/p%3e&#8221;"], "published": "2015-08-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:11:10.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
