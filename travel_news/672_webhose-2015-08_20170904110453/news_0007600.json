Vardy is set to meet with the FA’s technical director Dan Ashworth next week and will be reminded of his responsibilities in line with England’s code of conduct. • Gokhan Inler signs from Napoli on three-year deal The Leicester City forward was fined a week’s wages of £40,000 and ordered to undergo diversity awareness training by his club after a video was published of him allegedly abusing a Japanese man. Vardy issued a full apology, admitting he had made a \"regrettable error in judgement\", and the FA is understood to be satisfied with Leicester’s course of action and reaction to the incident. Some called for Jamie Vardy to be sacked over the casino incident But the 28-year-old will still receive a reminder from the FA over his actions off the field, after he was called up to the England squad by Roy Hodgson in May. Vardy is expected to be named in the squad on Tuesday for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Switzerland, after an impressive start to the season under new Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri. Even if he is not selected for the two games in September, he will still meet with Ashworth for talks as he was capped in the international friendly against the Republic of Ireland. England’s code of conduct was introduced in 2012 and demands “the highest standards of conduct and behaviour at all times, including when players are not on international duty”. Ashworth wrote to Saido Berahino earlier this year when the West Bromwich Albion forward was banned from driving for 12 months after pleading guilty to drink-driving. The incident involving Vardy is unlikely to affect his place in Hodgson's squad, particularly after his role in Leicester's flawless start to the season. He scored in the 4-2 win over Sunderland on the opening day and was hugely influential in the victory at West Ham last weekend. Shinji Okazaki, Leicester’s Japan international, has insisted there are no problems between him and Vardy after the incident. Claudio Ranieiri seems keen to put the incident behind him He said: \"It is difficult to comment about the matter as nothing was said directly to myself. As I wasn't there, it is difficult for me to judge the context or emotions behind the words. “All I know is that Jamie is truly sorry and has been punished. I would like to draw a line under this matter and focus on the football instead. \"Personally, I believe I have a good relationship with Jamie. We have a laugh together and he is a nice guy. On the pitch, we have a great relationship and the setting up of the goal has reaffirmed our ability to work well together.\" TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T01:16:08.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
