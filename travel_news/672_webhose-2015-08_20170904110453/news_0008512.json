Last year 24.5 million domestic visitors came to Charm City, where they spent $5.2 billion, the tourism and convention bureau said at its annual meeting Wednesday. The high visitation and spending came during a year boosted by large-scale events including Star-Spangled Spectacular, a weeklong festival that alone drew 1.43 million visitors . And visitor spending generated $649 million in state and local taxes. During the course of fiscal 2015, Visit Baltimore booked 398 future events and 424,115 future room nights at local hotels. Those figures were slightly down from previous years, a dip Visit Baltimore CEO Tom Noonan attributed to April’s unrest that fell just before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2014, the group booked 461,247 future room nights last year, and it locked down 477,764 room nights the year before. In the wake of the riots and protests earlier this year, occupancy at Baltimore hotels has been down 5 percent to 10 percent, Noonan said, and business at Baltimore’s museums, attractions and restaurants has taken an even harder hit due to fewer day trippers visiting the city. “I think that trend will continue through the summer period,” Noonan said. To combat the negative media attention surrounding the riots — which Noonan said outweighed the $33 million in positive press generated from Star-Spangled Spectacular — Visit Baltimore is investing heavily in marketing strategies that showcase the tourism and meeting amenities Baltimore has to offer. The group launched its \"My Bmore\" campaign studded with local celebrities weeks before the riots, but that push was put on hold until June. Now Noonan said Visit Baltimore plans to add two to three new celebrities to the campaign that already includes Cal Ripken Jr., Julie Bowen and Common. \nWant Baltimore Travel news in your inbox?
