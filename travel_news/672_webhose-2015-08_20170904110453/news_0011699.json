American will add its code to the route.\nAmerican currently operates twice-daily service from DFW to NRT with Boeing 777-200 aircraft. JAL will offer customers service four days per week with Boeing 787-8 aircraft fitted with the airline’s latest cabin interiors and seats in a three-class configuration and is considering scheduling daily service for spring 2016.\n“On behalf of American’s 100,000 employees, we welcome our joint business partner, Japan Airlines, to our great hub in Dallas/Fort Worth,” said Andrew Nocella, American’s chief marketing officer. “American is making great strides to expand our presence in Asia, and this partnership represents a key component of that effort. This new service complements American’s existing service and brings more choice for our customers traveling between Asia and the U.S., providing more opportunities to connect Asia to South America. Japan Airlines is an honorable partner and a great friend to American.”\n“We are pleased to announce the return of Dallas/Fort Worth to our international network, which becomes our eighth gateway in North America and our fourth U.S. service launch in just over three years,” said Yoshiharu Ueki, President of Japan Airlines. “By making full use of the efficiencies of the Dreamliner as well as capitalizing on our even stronger relationship with American Airlines, we are confident this resumed service will provide even more valuable links for commercial and cultural exchanges for our customers in both regions and beyond.”\n“We are honored to welcome back Japan Airlines to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and are excited about the outstanding connectivity and customer service they will provide to passengers flying to Japan and throughout Asia,” said Sean Donohue, chief executive officer of DFW Airport. “With the addition of this new flight to Tokyo, coupled with partner American Airlines’ two daily flights, DFW Airport will further support our mission to connect the world to Dallas Fort Worth.”\nThe return of JAL service brings more travel choices with 18 weekly roundtrips between DFW and NRT offered by the joint business. Through American’s extensive network from DFW, customers traveling from Tokyo can connect to more than 200 cities throughout North, Central and South America.\nCustomers transiting through DFW will also benefit from JAL’s newest route with International to International Baggage Transfer (subject to government approval). This is available to customers who check baggage through to their final destination to and from select countries outside of the United States. The process forgoes the need for customers to reclaim their baggage at DFW and adds another layer of ease and comfort to their journey.\nAmerican and JAL commenced their Pacific Joint Business partnership in April 2011, and have since greatly expanded customer benefits including better flight schedules, expanded codesharing, more coordinated services and greater access to a wider variety of fares.\nJAL will offer a special bonus mile campaign for JAL Mileage Bank loyalty program members.
