Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Aug 03, 2015 Adv: \nIf the grapevine is to be believed, Google Street View will soon come to the Samburu National Park, and neighboring game reserves too, to do what they did in key cities around the world - put the park on the map. It is understood that the giant IT company is planning to do this in partnership with ‘Save the Elephant’, a global conservation NGO with particular focus on elephants. \nThe feature, once it goes live on Google Streets, will no doubt provide an insight for potential visitors to Kenya, who would like to see what to expect when visiting such remote areas as Samburu, and as such will join the ranks of a few live webcams spread around Kenya, which can be accessed on the internet by wannabe visitors or those who have been on location while on safari and are keen to ‘stay in touch’ with events around waterholes. \nThe tourism industry will no doubt welcome the initiative and should perhaps engage with Google to put other Kenyan parks on Google Street View too, albeit renamed into Google park view.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T08:16:23.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
