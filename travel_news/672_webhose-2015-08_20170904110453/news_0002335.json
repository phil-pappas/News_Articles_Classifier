An arms-length body would oversee a “shift in culture” for Welsh tourism, the party says. \nShe said recent improvements were due to the appointment of a panel of tourism experts, who she said should be given the job of \"running it for themselves\". \nWelsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies added: \"Ultimately, Welsh tourism needs a shift in culture, with the industry itself taking the lead.\" But Mr Skates said the Tories were \"woefully out of touch with the tourism sector\", and claimed scrapping Visit Wales would cause \"chaos\". \"Instead of wishing to tear up a structure that has led to record-breaking success, the Tories should be looking to reduce VAT on tourism - a proposal they've arrogantly rejected out of hand,\" he said. Meanwhile, Pembrokeshire hotelier Chris Osborne, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance representing businesses, said there was a case for change. \n\"Tourism probably gets more attention from government, more respect,\" he said, referring to the current in-house arrangements. \n\"But a case could be made to return to the old model - the industry could benefit from being freed from the bureaucracy of the Welsh government.\" Source: www.bbc.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:39:49.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
