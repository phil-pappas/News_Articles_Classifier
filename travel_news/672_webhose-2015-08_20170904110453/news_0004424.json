Therefore, starting off with the latest attractions seems like a good idea. \nOn the first day, we — a group of Thai reporters — arrived at the resort in the afternoon and did not have much energy after an early morning flight. Nonetheless, a programme at the Adventure Cove Waterpark breathed new life into us. Walking past the Snorkel With 20,000 Fish, Riptide Rocket, Bluwater Bay and Duelling Racer, we reached Dolphin Island, which offers seven interaction programmes for guests to meet Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. \nMarine mammal trainers and hosts first shared knowledge about dolphins, their diets, habitats, anatomies and migration patterns, as well as research and veterinary care for these dolphins. As our group had limited time and did not wear wetsuits, the 15-minute Dolphin Encounter was the most suitable programme for us. Without getting into the water, we interacted with one of the dolphins from the edge of the lagoon by touching her body gently. After that, the dolphin swam around, jumped over the water and played with the trainer. As we were about to leave Dolphin Island, we saw a group of visitors spending time in the shallow water with a dolphin under the 90-minute Dolphin Discovery programme. \nThe next day was for our pleasant experience at the Universal Studios Singapore which houses 24 rides, shows and attractions in seven themed zones. This place combines the highlights of Universal Studios in California, Hollywood, Orlando, Florida and Osaka, Japan. \nThe first thing for us to do was to test our physical strength and courage by riding the world's tallest pair of duelling roller coasters in Sci-Fi City. Themed after the popular television show Battlestar Galactica , this pair of roller coasters, the seated one and the suspended one called \"Human\" and \"Cylon\", propelled us on a zero-g roll, a cobra roll, corkscrews, several inversions and vertical loops. The ride took 90 seconds to complete its 1km route, which thrilled us enough and even caused dizziness for some of us. Yet all agreed we had a lot of fun. \nPuss In Boots' Giant Journey. \nThe next destination was the park's latest attraction — Puss In Boots' Giant Journey. Riding the world's first Puss In Boots themed roller coaster, we felt like we joined Puss and Kitty in the pursuit of golden eggs to save San Ricardo Orphanage. This adventure was much more gentle and pleasant with the sight of cute animated figures. \nAfter that, we went separately to enjoy our favourite attractions and shows in the park's Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, Lost World, Far Far Away and Madagascar zones. Most of us chose the 3D thrill ride called Transformers in which we joined Optimus Prime and the Autobots to fight the evil Decepticons who were invading Nest headquarters to steal the Allspark. The anti-gravity ride and the digital projection took us to race through the city, down the streets, subway tunnels and across high-rise buildings. \nThe Revenge of the Mummy, an indoor roller coaster, took me through simulated fireballs, scarab beetles and robotic warrior mummies — in complete darkness. We had to find the Book of Living and destroy the evil Imhotep before he and his followers could steal our soul. Later, I enjoyed more gentle rides, including Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (a rafting adventure within the Jurassic Park compound) and Madagascar: A Crate Adventure (a river boat adventure with the animated figures). Also, I watched the Shrek 4D Adventure movie. A few more fun rides and shopping followed until the park closed at dusk. \nOn the last day, our group visited S.E.A. Aquarium, home to more than 100,000 marine animals from 800 species. A visit here resembles a journey through the oceans around the globe. The highlight is the Open Ocean where leopard sharks, manta rays and a wide range of marine life can be seen through a 36m-long and 8.3m-high viewing panel. We were also fascinated by the Shipwreck scene where batfish, trevally and pompanos swim around divers, as well as the Shark Seas featuring more than 200 sharks of 12 species. \nAt the end of the day, we flew back to the City of Angels with joy, good memories and knowledge about marine life plus a few soft toys and cute souvenirs we bought from those attractions.
