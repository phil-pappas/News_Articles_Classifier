Tickets for the Miami Dolphins have risen 33% from the previous season, 6.5% greater than the rise in prices for the Buffalo Bills, who saw the second-highest increase. Fueling the surge in demand is renewed fan optimism, marquee matchups with some of the league's biggest franchises, as well as major changes to Sun Life Stadium. \nThe Dolphins get to host two rare match-ups this season, playing both the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants in their home stadium. Those games have the highest priced tickets this season for the Dolphins, selling for an average of $228 with a $149 \"get in\" price and $210 with a $131 get in price, respectively.* \nThe Dolphins made changes to Sun Life Stadium this season including brand new seats, new suites, and 4 high-definition video boards in each corner of the stadium. \"When you consider the new renovations to the stadium, it's no surprise the Dolphins saw the largest increase in average ticket price,\" says Shawntay Nelson, Sports Specialist at TicketNetwork. \"The improvements will enhance the game day experience and the fans are buying in.\" \nThe Dolphins will also host one of the three games in the United Kingdom's Wembley Stadium this season, competing against the New York Jets on October 4. Tickets are going for an average of $192 for one of the league's most unique regular season games. \nWith potential playoff implications, Dolphins fans are excited for the season finale against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots as the average ticket price is going for $208. The Dolphins have not been to the playoffs since 2008 when they finished 11-5. \nOverall, the AFC East saw a 17% increase in average ticket prices for the division, the highest increase in the league. The AFC East also saw a 34% increase in overall sales on TicketNetwork.com, second only to the NFC East. \nCertainly adding to fan enthusiasm heading into the season are the moves made by the Dolphins' front office during the off-season. Miami signed prized free agent defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh to a six year, $114 million contract, which is the biggest for a defensive player in NFL history. The Dolphins have high expectations for QB Ryan Tannehill after giving him a four year-$77 million contract extension. The Dolphins are in position to make a postseason run with the additions of veteran receiver Greg Jennings and emerging star Kenny Stills. \n*Ticket sales data as of 8/3/2015 9:00 a.m. EDT.
