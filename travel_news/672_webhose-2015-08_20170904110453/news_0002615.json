Guests will be transported to paradise and a vacation state of mind through the Margaritaville branded resort that will include a hotel, vacation ownership and vacation homes. Inspired by the lifestyle celebrated in Jimmy Buffett’s iconic songs, the resort will become an oasis for relaxation and fun – that “one particular harbour,” and will offer many experiential opportunities including a “FinCity” arcade, a St. Somewhere Spa, a planetarium and the Son of a Sailor fishing school, paddleboarding and kayaking. Ancillary to the Margaritaville Hotel, Encore is developing its own proprietary brands for food and beverage outlets, which will be owned and operated independently by Encore or its subsidiaries. \n“This vacation resort – offering such a variety of lodging options - will make Margaritaville available to everyone looking for a port of paradise in Orlando,” said John Cohlan, CEO of Margaritaville Holdings LLC. “Margaritaville is about escapism, relaxation, and vacation and we are excited to partner with Encore to develop such an exceptional experience.” \nThe 300-acre community will be located on US Highway 192 near State Road 429 in western Osceola County. The project will include an expansive aquatic amenity and lake with beach area. The community will also feature 170,000 square feet of retail and a regional water park. \n“We’re excited to partner with an established lifestyle brand and develop a unique resort offering in this key area of Central Florida,” said Encore co-founder and Managing Principal, Art Falcone. “There is no other lifestyle brand that knows how to vacation like Margaritaville and we look forward to building this destination experience in Orlando.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:45:42.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
