Surrounded by the IJ lake and offering views of Pampus island and the village of Durgerdam, the campsite is set next to the Blijburg beach club, which offers a sandy beach. It is also a five-minute walk from restaurants along the harbour. The 'Vall ross' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Minimally equipped with only a “comfortable” double bed, each habitable installation differs in size, shape and style. • 36 Hours in Amsterdam The 'Solid Family' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) The unusual sleeping spaces include the trampoline-roofed “Trampotent” and elevated houses such as the domed “Universe 7” which offers lake views and can apparently be rotated to meet the position of the sun. The 'Upside down you turn me' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Some installations come with a separate outdoor seating area such as the “lbc Shrinkwrap house” and the “Superfire Camp” which offers a semicircular seating area around a campfire and an outdoor hot tub dug into the sand. • Top 10 budget hotels in Amsterdam The 'Superfire Camp' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) While there is no electricity in each sleeping space, technology addicts can book to use a solar-powered, office-like ‘workation’ space equipped with Wi-Fi, a desk and chair at the KantoorKaravaan installation. The 'lbc Shrinkwrap house' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) The website also says the campsite will \"make sure there is a romantic light available” in each installation. • Campsites with a twist The 'Trampotent' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Guests will need to bring their own towels and toiletries while the two storey-high “Tribal Toilet Tower” facility, built using toilets, showers, compost and septic tanks, is available for communal use. The 'Tribal Toilet Tower' (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Other shared facilities on offer include a fireplace, a hammock and a small kitchen in the \"¿Kwiezien?\", a common area made entirely of sustainable and recycled materials offering a “free but intimate atmosphere” and a “cosy public place to hang out”. The 'Bedbug' space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Campers can also harvest and use herbs that other previous guests have planted in the site’s herb garden as well as plant new ones for future guests. • Britain's 20 best coastal campsites The interior of the 'Bedbug' (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) The 'Kantoorkaravaan' work space (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) The open-air exhibition is available for viewing to both visitors and overnight guests. Stays at the UrbanCampsite can be booked via the Airbnb website. Bookings are available for stays through August this year from €85 per night. Bookings are also available from January next year, according to the Airbnb website. • Britain's most spectacular campsites The 'Goahti' (Photo: urbancampsiteamsterdam.com) Three of the featured artworks were contributed by the ARCAM (Amsterdam Centre for Architecture), while the rest were designed by local artists and architectural design students. The camp aims to breathe new life into this underused area of the city and show that “even the most remote place can receive an exciting dimension”, according to the company’s website.
