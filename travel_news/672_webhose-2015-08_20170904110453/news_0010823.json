It was completed and named after Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto in 1900, then all but abandoned in 1910. A caretaker force was in place until World War II, when it was used as a bombing range for MacDill Air Force Base. \nAll that remains today is one of the two original mortar batteries with four of its guns still in place. \nWildlife \nA natural waypoint for migrating birds, Fort De Soto Park comes alive for birdwatchers in spring and fall. More than 300 species of birds have been identified in the park. \nAnd if you can't get enough, take the ferry out to the Egmont Key Wildlife Refuge, which is also managed as a state park. Daily ferry service from Fort De Soto's Bay Pier to Egmont Key costs $20. \nCamping Tips \nFort Desoto's campground is popular year-around, but especially with wintering RVers, who religiously book reservations at the first opportunity six months in advance. Pinellas County residents get seven months. \nSites can be reserved for a maximum of seven days, and some sites are set aside for walk-ins, available online at 7 a.m. the day of arrival. If any remain, book in person at the park office. \nReservations can be made online at www.pinellascounty.org or in person at the park office. \nIf You Go: \nFort De Soto is southwest of St. Petersburg on the State Road 679 extension of the Pinellas Bayway (toll), in Tierra Verde. Admission to the park is $5. Camping fees range from $33.60 per night for tents to $45.37 for RV waterfront, including taxes. \nRelated links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:16:41.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
