Looking to fill up the gas tank, Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS.A - Get Report ) appears to have the most locations, particularly along I-95 or I-75. \nA popular eatery along the Interstate is country restaurant, Cracker Barrel ( CBRL - Get Report ) , which almost always has a crowded parking lot. A popular dinner location that is only available at major Interstate exits is Olive Garden, a restaurant owned by Darden Restaurants ( DRI - Get Report ) . \nTravelers who plan ahead should make reservations at one of the hotel chains owned by Marriott International ( MAR - Get Report ) such as Courtyard by Marriott. A Courtyard has comfortable rooms, high-speed Internet service and a restaurant for breakfast or evening meals. \nMcDonald's has totally rebuilt many of its locations over the past two years and has simplified its menus. A recent survey of consumers who eat breakfast at any hour of the day chose McDonald's as the top choice. \nThe fast-food chain will benefit when some breakfast items become day-long selections on the Golden Arches menu. \nTravelers can plan ahead and prepay for their gas purchased using Shell gift cards. Check local grocery stores several weeks before traveling as some are offering a $50 gift card for $40 for each $50 spent on groceries. \nFor dining and overnight stays become a Marriott Rewards member, and a Visa card under this program will yield points for purchases. Accumulating points will result in free overnight stays at a Courtyard. \nHere is the weekly chart for Cracker Barrel: \nCourtesy of MetaStock Xenith \nCracker Barrel closed at $146.47 on Thursday, up 6% year to date and 18.3% above its Feb. 9 low of $119.61. The stock is below its 50-day simple moving average of $149.37 and above its 200-day SMA of $138.63. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T16:40:01.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
