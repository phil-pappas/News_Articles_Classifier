Janna Rowan, the chairwoman of the Michigan nonprofit Cycling2Give, began a four-day bicycle ride Friday from her home in DeWitt to Cleveland. She estimates she will arrive in Adrian at approximately 10 a.m. today, Aug. 8. She will be on a stretch between Brooklyn and Millbury, Ohio, which is on the southeast side of Toledo and where she intends to spend her second night on the road. “I decided to support the military because our freedom isn’t free. Although I have no family members in the military, I have friends that are. And it struck me one day how easy it is for people to complain about our government but they forget they have that right to complain because of those fighting for the freedom to do so,” Rowan said. Her long-distance cycling passion began in 2013 when Rowan pedaled from Michigan to Fort Worth, Texas, for a deaf/blind organization. When she returned home, Rowan said she “had to do more. “In 2014, Ipedaled from Michigan to Nashville, Tennessee, to raise awareness for funds for care packages for our troops. This year, I am working with the USO in Cleveland,” she said. “I plan to hand-deliver a donation check to the USO Northern Ohio office.” Rowan said she is most excited about this trip because she will be receiving vehicle support from a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant. More information about the United Service Organizations — commonly known as USO — in northern Ohio can be found at us.uso.org/NorthernOhio , including a way to donate online.
