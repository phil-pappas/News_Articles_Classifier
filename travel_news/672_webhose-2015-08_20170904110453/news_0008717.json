The underlying result was within the group's guidance range.\nSeven West Media was formed after the sale of Seven Media Group to West Australian Newspapers Holdings. It operates Network 7, and publishes the West Australian newspaper and Pacific Magazines.\nMost of the writedowns related to television goodwill and licences impairments recognised as part of the 2011 West Australian Newspapers-Seven West Media transaction.\nThe media conglomerate's revenues during the year slipped 4 per cent to $1.77 billion, slightly below the average analyst expectation of $1.79 billion.\nEarnings before interest and tax dropped 13 per cent year-on-year, falling to $356.3 million.\nThe media giant also forecast a softer year ahead, expecting underlying earnings before interest and tax to decline 5 to 10 per cent during the 2016 financial year.\nSeven West said it was expecting low single-digit growth for the television advertising market.\nSeven's chief executive Tim Worner said the firm was focused ahead on its digital and subscription-based future.\n“Our moves into subscription video on demand and live streaming underline this strategy,\" Mr Worner said.\n\"Seven’s moves into live-streaming and further expansion of its PLUS 7 offering on Yahoo, coupled with further development of the digital businesses of The West Australian and Pacific Magazines is expected to underpin further growth in digital revenues,\" he said.\nIn late June, the firm made a flurry of appointments to the corporate board, after undertaking a \"far-ranging review\" of the group's board structure after a string of high-profile exits, following the retirement of Graeme John, Doug Flynn and Don Voelte from the group over the last twelve months\nSeven West will pay a final fully-franked dividend of 4c on October 9, down from last year's 6c final payout.\nSeven West Media (Frame content direct link: http://markets.theaustralian.com.au/embed/SWM/640 .)\nThe Australian\n Seven West posts $1.89bn loss", "external_links": ["http://markets.theaustralian.com.au/embed/SWM/640", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/seven-west-media-posts-189-billion-full-year-loss/story-fni0dcne-1227489733479"], "published": "2015-08-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T07:54:48.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
