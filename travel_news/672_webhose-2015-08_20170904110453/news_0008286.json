Using colourful language, as Mr Wingate has done, does not turn weak points into strong ones, and does him and his company no credit.\"\nWingate’s response came more than a month after Heathrow was recommended as the best airport in the south east for expansion.\nThe decision has been criticised by political heavyweights such as Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith and environmental groups.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-20T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:06:51.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
