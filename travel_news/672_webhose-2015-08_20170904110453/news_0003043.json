Picture: Facebook/Preston King Source: Supplied\nHe returned to New York and landed a job with a reality TV show through his producer sister — but then lost it for showing up to work drunk.\nBut even all that did little to prepare his family for the shock they got following The New York Post report.\nKristine said their mum spotted the photo and immediately called her, leading Kristine to email the publication, which put her in touch with Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins.\nHours later, Kristine and SBA Treasurer Paul Capotosto were scouring New York’s Greenwich Village and handing out flyers to find her brother.\n“The sergeants, the SBA and The New York Post are amazing,” she said.\nPast life ... William ‘Preston’ King once lived a life of luxury. Picture: Facebook/Preston King Source: Supplied\nThe last his family knew, Preston was getting detoxed at Arms Acres in Putnam County, New York, where he was sent after a January incident at his sister’s house, where he had been living.\nKristine said he had been seeing a shrink who prescribed him Adderall, which Preston abused to the point of paranoia. She said she cut ties with him for stealing her cash.\n“I screamed at him about taking the money and told him to write me a letter and apologise when he comes clean, and we’ll talk,” she said. “That was the last time we spoke.”\nStockbrokers ...
