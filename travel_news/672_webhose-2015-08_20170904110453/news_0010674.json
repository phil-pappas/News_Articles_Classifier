Source: Getty Images \nTRAVEL is one of the most meaningful ways to enjoy your free time. \nIf you’re travelling with kids, it’s the opportunity to raise children who are globally aware. If you’re travelling solo, it’s a chance to find yourself. And if you’re travelling as a couple, it can be a time to deepen your bond. \nOf course, that’s often easier said than done. Sometimes you need a little advice. That’s why I’ve reached out to leading travel agents, travel writers, and other experts to find out the best advice they’ve ever received about travelling. \nFrom the practical to the philosophical, here’s what they have to say. \n• Lower your expectations \nPaul Wiseman, president of tour operator Trafalgar, says: “Remember, things are not the same abroad as they are at home. Expect it to be different. \n“Understand that it’s not only okay, it’s why you travel in the first place ... Lower your expectations and you will have a better time.” \n• Be open \nMonica Poling, a freelance travel writer and editor of Travel Glitter , a website focusing on culture and community in travel, says the best piece of advice she ever received was to step outside her comfort zone. \n“I tend to be a creature of habit, and even when travelling I inadvertently fall back into regular patterns,” she said. \n“So I always try to speak to as many locals as possible and try to stay open to new possibilities whenever I can. These have often led to once-in-a-lifetime experiences that you won’t find in a guidebook and cannot easily be replicated. \n“For example, drinking cava with a policeman and his family in a remote island in Fiji while he talked about life during the coup and how Fijians live with the constant threat of tropical storms. \n“Being invited to a post-party in a San Francisco dance studio with a touring Flamenco group. No one in the group spoke any English, but I learned so much about life in Spain and on the road. \n“Or cave repelling in Mexico where the equipment didn’t fit me, so the outfitters created a custom harness for me out of rope. In retrospect, probably not very safe, but so cool for a minute I was able to conquer my fear of heights.” Cenote Dzitnup near Valladolid, Mexico.

It’s part of the travel experience.” \n• Rituals are key \nCareer travel writer Jane Lasky has more practical advice for travellers. She says that, after chasing wanderlust for more than four decades, she has come up with some rituals other travellers may want to adopt. \n“Especially for business trips, always share your itinerary with your family and close colleagues. Be sure to pencil in the details so if you need to you can be easily contacted.” \nLasky also says you should do your homework. \n“Don’t just head out and learn about the land you are about to discover. Instead, learn as much as you can by making a virtual visit before you go and then go on to find out about culture-specific etiquette practices. Even learn a few words of the native tongue. \n“These practices will gain you major points and potential friends as you show respect to the ‘when in Rome’ theory.” \nAs for my advice? Stop and smell the roses. That’s what I was advised to do on my first backpacking trip to Europe. I took this to mean take your time and travel slowly, don’t rush through every stop or keep your camera glued to your eyeball. \nMy most memorable trips are the ones that I didn’t rush through. When I travelled to Auckland for six weeks, I had lofty plans to explore every inch of New Zealand because six weeks seemed like such a long time, but I didn’t even get halfway through the North Island and I could easily have spent all six weeks just exploring Northland and Bay of Islands. \nTake your time and immerse yourself in a destination, otherwise it may feel like you’re just ticking some place off a list. \nThis story originally appeared on SmarterTravel.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:36:50.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
