Anyone can vote – you do not have to live in the UK.\nThere are more than 70 awards categories but you do not have to vote in them all – just opt for as many as you wish.\nIf you just want to vote once for the Best Airport Parking Company, that’s absolutely fine. It’s really that simple.\nThe online voting form also allows you to return to it as many times as you like up to September 30 to change your votes or add new ones.\nYou’ll also be invited to take part in a survey that looks at the nation’s holiday plans for 2016. It’s voluntary and, like the awards voting, you can do as much or as little as you wish.\nAnd to say thanks for taking part in the survey, you get a bonus entry in the holiday prize draw!\nThe award winners will be announced at a glittering gala evening with the industry’s movers and shakers in London on November  25.\nFull terms and conditions and vote form at britishtravelawards.com DailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://britishtravelawards.com/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-08-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T15:25:03.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
