Since then, I’ve been hearing from friends and reading stories of woe — if not actual horror — that point out the limitations of my etiquette advice. This includes the recent story reported by The New York Times in which a 19-year-old was locked into a Madrid apartment by his host. He was then sexually assaulted.\nFor those of you not familiar with Airbnb, the worldwide lodging service was founded in 2008 as an alternative to traditional hotels. Hosts use the service to list their properties, which may be an entire house, a shared flat, or a private room. Guests, according to the site, “Discover amazing places … including unique accommodations like castles and igloos.” It’s completely turnkey, with no middleman, often resulting in prices much lower than you’d find in other types of accommodations. (Disclosure: I have stayed at several Airbnbs.)\nBut apparently there can be hidden costs. In the case of the 19-year-old, he texted his mother about the threatening situation as it was still unfolding; when she reached out to Airbnb, she told the Times, “[I]ts employees would not give her the address and would not call the police.” The young man was able to escape — but not without harm.\nIf this were the only such reported case, I’d think about taking it as unfortunate aberration. After all, stuff happens, and a 19-year-old traveling alone may have been vulnerable in a traditional hotel, too. But lately I’ve read other scary stories: Earlier this year an American staying in Argentina at a Salta Airbnb was attacked by the host’s Rottweiler, resulting in a six-square-inch gash. At first Airbnb wouldn’t even cover the guest’s two-night hospital stay. (It relented after media inquiries). Then, of course, there are run-of-the-mill issues: pest problems, unclean bathrooms, theft, and more. (Check out AirbnbHell .)\nAll of this raises the crucial question for any traveler: How safe will you be in Airbnb’s accommodations? In response to the Madrid situation, Airbnb points out that 800,000 other guests had stayed in rentals without incident that same weekend, and that the assault was “unique.” That may be, but if I’m going to stay at an Airbnb, or any other on online rental, I’d like to be sure there are reasonable safety procedures in place. To that point, Jakob Kerr, a company spokesperson, explained via email: “We can learn a lot from this incident and we can do better. We are clarifying our policies: we will always contact law enforcement if we know about an emergency situation in progress. Safety is our number one priority, and we want to get our hosts and guests as much help as possible.”\nThat’s a crucial first step. But there’s also the question of how much legal responsibility Airbnb assumes if, say, you’re assaulted or injured (either by your host or his dog). In general the answer is: Not nearly as much as a traditional hotel does, if only because some hosts run their Airbnbs without the knowledge of (or coverage from) their insurance companies.\nWhat should prospective travelers do to minimize risk and maximize safety?\n-- Be sure to take the time to read the entire listing and, most importantly, reviews from previous guests. If something doesn’t feel right, move on.\n-- Only contact hosts with “verified IDs.”\n-- If you’re renting a room in a shared residence, ask whether the room has a deadbolt that you can lock from the inside.\n-- Ask if the rental has fire extinguishers as well as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.\n-- Before you leave on your trip, make sure you leave the Airbnb address and host’s name and phone number with a friend so they will know where to find you.\nNaturally, this advice also applies to other similar services like HomeAway and VRBO. In the meantime, I’ve rented an Airbnb in Northern California for a short vacation later this month. So far, so good; I’ll give you a report after I return – with any luck in one piece.\nAgree or disagree with my advice?
