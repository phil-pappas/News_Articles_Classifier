With the accelerated delivery schedule, six G450s will be flying in the Flexjet fleet by the end of this year, bolstering Flexjet’s ability to serve international routes nonstop. \nThe G450 is part of an order Flexjet placed in October 2014 for up to 50 aircraft, also including the G500 and G650, from Gulfstream’s iconic line of business jets. Through its close partnership with Gulfstream, Flexjet will closely monitor demand and collaborate with the manufacturer to accelerate deliveries and exercise any of the additional 26 options whenever possible. \n“Since we took delivery of our first Gulfstream G450 aircraft in June, the response to these new long-range aircraft has been so robust that we have asked Gulfstream to move up delivery of our next two G450 aircraft to this fall, rather than mid-2016, as previously agreed to,” said Flexjet Chief Executive Officer Michael Silvestro. “Our sales for the year are up 20 percent and the marketplace clearly is hungry for extended-range products from Gulfstream. Stepping up our delivery schedule will help us to satisfy this appetite. Gulfstream’s willingness to make this change for us illustrates the type of strong partnership we have built during the past year.” \nThe entry into service of Flexjet’s version of the G450 positions Flexjet as the only fractional provider offering the newest and most advanced version of this aircraft, featuring the LXi cabin design and configuration. Capable of being configured to carry up to 16 passengers, the G450 can travel 4,350 nautical miles/8,056 kilometers with eight passengers, easily enabling nonstop trips from the U.S. to European and South American destinations. Fortune 500 corporations and other large business flyers, including flight departments in need of supplemental capacity, have shown the strongest interest in the G450. \n“In the fractional jet industry, you hear a lot about orders for new planes being delayed or cancelled – not accelerated. Not only have we had strong demand for the Gulfstream G450, but we also are seeing tremendous enthusiasm for the G650. We are pleased to be able to take delivery of the G650 early next year, making us the only fractional provider offering this aircraft,” said Chairman Kenn Ricci. “With the G450, G650 and other advanced new aircraft entering our fleet, we are well-positioned to meet the needs and expectations of today’s fractional fliers.” \nIn addition to the Gulfstream G450 and G650, Flexjet will be the North American launch customer, and exclusive fractional provider, for the Gulfstream G500 expected to be delivered in 2018. The G500 will offer the finest in speed, wide-cabin comfort and efficiency. Outfitted for 12 passengers, the G500 will be capable of flying 5,000 nautical miles/9,260 kilometers. \nGulfstream’s G450, G500 and G650 will become part of Flexjet’s LXi Cabin Collection, which also includes the Learjet 75, the Challenger 350, Bombardier’s Global Express aircraft and the Embraer Legacy 450 and Legacy 500. The additions will further reduce the age of Flexjet’s fleet, already the youngest in the fractional industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T03:45:46.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
