He says the event gives him access to invaluable knowledge of the best luxury products on the international market which is vital for the kind of bespoke travel experience he offers his clients.\n“I call us matchmakers – I have the client on one end and the hotelier on the other – and we use the information we have to ensure they are perfectly matched,” Mr Englman said on the eve of his trip.\n“If we have to define our role as travel advisors in an emerging market where the internet is perceived to rule supreme – this is our competitive advantage.\n“For the high end luxury market, where a client wants a tailored experience that is a best fit for them, you need someone who is well connected in that market who can put the two pieces of the puzzle together. Thats what Virtuoso Travel Week helps me do.”\nMr Englman said while the meetings were important, he found the networking events vital for making solid business connections.\n“With every booking we do we contact management in the hotel and let them know about our client’s needs and wants, and these are the contacts we make at VTW.\n“The hotel can then provide an informed service that makes them a standout and they appreciate the opportunity to give memorable service in a competitive market.”\nVirtuoso Asia Pacific Managing Director, Michael Londregan said almost 100 Virtuoso travel advisors from Australia, NZ and Asia were heading to VTW, a record number.\n“The market reality is that clients can’t VIP themselves and for many the process of being treated to an exclusive experience starts with the hard work our Virtuoso advisors and suppliers do this week,” Mr Londregan said.\n“Our business model is founded on the relationship between advisors and suppliers who, in harmony, create wow for the clients – VTW is the relationship steroid.”\nSource:- Virtuoso", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:23:34.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
