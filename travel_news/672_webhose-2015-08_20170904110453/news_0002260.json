Set against the current backdrop, they weren’t a bad set of financial results: profits were up, net debt was down and trading was more or less in line with last year. What grabbed the headlines though, was the extent of the financial cost borne by the group following the tragic events in Tunisia. \nCook revealed it had spent around £20 million relocating some 15,000 of its customers from Tunisia to other destinations. Though undoubtedly a footnote in the overall story, the group acted swiftly and its commendable actions went some way towards repairing a reputation battered by the mishandling of the Corfu debacle earlier this year. \nElsewhere this week, news broke that International Villas, a UK-based villa rental company operating mainly in Ibiza and Majorca had gone into voluntary liquidation. \nOn the face of it, International Villas looks to be a pretty small failure, with a relatively small number of people affected, although that will be of little consolation to those poor families whose holiday plans are left in tatters. \nOf course, any failure at this peak time of year is bound to garner a disproportionate level of coverage, and so it was in this case, where mainstream media picked up the story. To add insult to injury, the company only sold accommodation and was therefore not legally required to hold any sort of licence or offer financial protection, leaving those affected with valid flight tickets but nowhere to turn and little alternative but to pay again for somewhere to stay. \nAs an interesting aside to the collapse, some media outlets speculated that the Spanish tax authorities had issued proceedings against a number of similar businesses for unpaid local taxes. \nIf this is true, could it be the first signs of a more combative approach from the Spanish tax authorities after so many years of looking the other way while accommodation providers and private owners ducked their tax obligations? Only time will tell, but there are sure to be some nervous expats watching with anticipation. \nAs the rain continues to batter most parts of the UK and we move further into the lates market, these stories tell two contrasting tales of woe that should serve to boost the popularity of the already resurgent package holiday. \nThe latter is a cautionary tale of the perils of DIY and the merits of Atol, while the former is a grim reminder of why it’s safer to book with a regulated tour operator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:07:17.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
