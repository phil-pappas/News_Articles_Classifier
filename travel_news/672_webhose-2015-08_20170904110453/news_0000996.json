Sid Lipsey August 14, 2015 \nHow would you feel about having to pay extra to call an airline’s customer service line? (Photo: Kelly Knox/Stocksy. Gif: Lauren DeLuca for Yahoo Travel.) \nIs it the latest example of an airline cutting another perk that passengers take for granted? Or is it just a case of junking a costly and outdated service that no one uses anymore, like pay phones? Frontier Airlines ’ latest cost-cutting move might be a little bit of both. The Denver Post reports the low-cost carrier has quietly gotten rid of its toll-free customer-service phone number that passengers used to contact the airline. Instead, anyone who wants to phone Frontier has to dial its Utah-based 801 area code — which, unless you’re calling from that same area code, counts as a long-distance call for which you might be charged (you probably won’t, but we’ll get to that). \nBudget carrier Frontier is getting rid of its toll-free number. (Photo: iStock) \nStill, for Frontier, which ranked dead last in a recent U.S. Transportation Department report on airline customer complaints (Spirit was next-to-last), retiring its toll-free number isn’t exactly winning it new fans, as we saw in some tweets bashing its latest change: \nAnd there was this particularly low blow: \nFrontier tells Yahoo Travel, it hasn’t gotten any specific complaints related to the switch from the 800-number, which the airline says was a cost-cutting move. (But perhaps that’s because there’s no 800-number to call and complain?) “We’re saving almost $2 million per year by ending the number,” Frontier spokesman Jim Faulkner says. “One of Frontier’s goals is to have the lowest costs in the industry so we can pass those savings along to customers.” Related: This is the Most Hated Airline on Social Media \nThat may be, but cynical flyers tend to beware of airlines bearing promises to “pass along savings” to customers. In the past, airlines shamelessly have used cost savings (from reduced fuel prices, for example) for things like buying new planes, updating existing planes, paying down debt, and just about everything else but lowering fares. \"I don’t see any way to tell if airlines will pass savings along to consumers rather than padding their bottom lines with the savings,“ says Airfare Watchdog founder George Hobica. \nWATCH: Airlines Unveil New Planes, Improved Interiors \nLow-cost carriers like Frontier have their own histories to live down: that of enticing passengers with rock-bottom basic fares only to tack-on exorbitant fees for everything from carrying-on luggage to, in Allegiant’s case, paying with a credit card. Could the end of toll-free numbers be yet another case of an airline robbing Peter to gouge Paul? \"It shows you how nickel and dime-ing these ultra low-cost airlines are,” says Joe Brancatelli of the business traveler blog Joe Sent Me . “They’re shifting all of the cost of flying to the passenger.\" \nRelated: No More Crying Babies: Are Child-Free Flights the Next Thing? \nBut as the issue of toll-free calls go, there’s the 800 Dollar Question succinctly posed by Brancatelli: \"Who the hell pays for long distance calls anymore?” he asks. Many of us — particularly millennials for whom the concept of paying for domestic calls is as big a mystery as the question, “What does ‘VCR’ stand for?”— don’t think twice about calling another area code. Surveys show as many as 90 percent of American adults own a cell phone, many of which offer unlimited long-distance calls. \nIt’s a trend Frontier noticed when it decided on the change. “The majority of our customers use cell phones with free minutes,” says Frontier’s Jim Faulkner. Adds Brancatelli: “Even if you still have a landline you probably are on a unlimited anytime/anyplace call package.” \nIn a land where smartphones and unlimited long-distance plans are rampant, does anyone care that Frontier stopped paying for toll-free numbers? (Photo: iStock) \nYes, there are those who are paying for long-distance calls. \"Some consumers still use ‘pay-as-you-go’ plans,” Hobica points out, “and lengthy hold times might eat into their minutes.\" \nStill, there are also those who have dial-up Internet connections, rabbit ears on their TVs, and rotary phones.* Should airlines spend millions each year to service a dwindling share of the market? \"I don’t know anybody on a mobile device who’s paying for domestic long-distance calls,” says Brancatelli. “Practically speaking for the customer, I don’t think [Frontier’s change] means anything.” \n*By the way, this is what a rotary phone looks like. (Photo: iStock) \nAnd Frontier isn’t the first low-cost airline to stop picking up the tab for customer service calls; Allegiant got rid of its toll-free number years five years ago. And to call Spirit Air , you also need to dial an 801 area code. \nSo if your airline of choice has done away with its toll-free number, there are still numerous ways to get in touch with airlines other than calling them directly: You can tweet the airline (be sure to use the airline’s correct “@” Twitter handle). The airlines can vary greatly in response times , but many passengers do get their problems addressed, and resolved, via Twitter. Use the airline’s web sites and/or smartphone apps — which, like it or not, are their preferred method of handling customer service issues. Says Hobica: “If you booked with an online travel agent go through them.”“OTAs” like Expedia or Priceline can sometimes intercede on your behalf to solve airline customer service issues, or connect you to the airline. Plus, Expedia and Priceline still have toll-free numbers. \nIf you absolutely must call the airline directly and don’t want to have to spend time hunting for their customer service numbers (airlines don’t always make those numbers easy to find on their websites) head to GetHuman.com . The site not only gives you the customer service number of any company of your choosing. It’ll also provide the right button combination that will connect you to a human being the fastest. \nAs of now, America’s big-three airlines — United , Delta , and American — still have toll-free numbers and show no indication of changing that anytime soon. But airlines tend to be notorious copycats when it comes to bottom line-boosting changes, as we saw with the domino-like proliferation of checked baggage fees. Customer complaints about that change were bitter, bordering on hysterical, and airline after airline pushed it through anyway ( JetBlue was the latest to fall ). So when faced with the prospect of saving millions of dollars a year by dumping a toll-free phone service that most customers neither need nor notice, airlines might find that to be an easy call. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
