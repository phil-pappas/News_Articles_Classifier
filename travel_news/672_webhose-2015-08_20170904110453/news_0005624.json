Some walkers spooked the animal, leading it to break out of the windshield.\nBefore it escaped, the bear pulled on the driver's door so hard the metal bent. It damaged interior plastic, put a nose print on a back window and left waste on the floor.\nStolpe says she guesses it's part of the Montana experience to get claw marks on the dashboard.\n___\nInformation from: The Billings Gazette, http://www.billingsgazette.com\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:25:49.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
