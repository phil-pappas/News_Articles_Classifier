Picture: Kurush Pawar Source: Flickr \nONE airline is bringing new meaning to excess baggage. \nUzbekistan Airways has announced it will begin asking customers to stand on the scales after they have had their hand luggage weighed. \nCustomers will be asked to proceed to a “special weighing machine” near their departure gates after check-in, the carrier says. \nUzbekistan Airlines website said it was introducing the measures as part of the safety requirements of the International Air Transport Association. \nYOUR SAY: Do you think weighing passengers is a good idea? Tell us below. \nIt’s believed that it will not result in extra charges for overweight passengers, yet it is unclear if overweight passengers could be prevented from boarding flights. \n“According to the rules of International Air Transport Association, airlines are obliged to carry out the regular procedures of preflight control passengers weighing with hand baggage to observe requirements for ensuring flight safety,” Uzbekistan Airways said. \nThe record of passenger weights will remain anonymous, according to the airline. Instead, weights will be categorised by gender or age, if the passenger is a child. \n“We will appreciate your assistance and thank you in advance for the help in the solution of our common task of flight safety!,” the airline adds in language seemingly directed at passengers. \nUzbekistan Airways isn’t the first to weigh passengers. In 2013, airline Samoa Air announced plans to charge passengers based on what they weigh. \nThis story originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T03:45:33.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
