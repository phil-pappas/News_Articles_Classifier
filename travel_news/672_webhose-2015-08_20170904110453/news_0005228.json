Hope you all have been doing great. Its been three weeks since I returned from my Ladakh sojourn. I thought I will briefly share some details of the trip, viz. itinerary, the hotels where we stayed, and other sundry information. Hope you find this useful. Day 0: Manali Night stay at: Punjab Cottages, Simsa Village Day 1: Manali - Jispa Night stay at: Padma Lodge. Nice cosy rooms. Good food. Good staff. Day 2: Jispa  Leh Night stay at: Hotel Kidar, Leh. Kidar is a first rate property with great facilities, great food, courteous staff and an affable host. Day 3: Leh  Lamayuru  Ulleytopo Places visited during the day: Gurudwara Pathar Sahib, Magnetic Hill (though this spot is now closed, we nonetheless visited it), Confluence of Indus & Zanskar Rivers @ Nimmu, Likir Monastery, Lamayuru Monastery, Adjacent Moon landscape. Night stay at: Uley Eco Resorts, Ulleytopo. The property is good, ensconced in beautiful environs. Food is good. But the place has no facility for the driver to stay! Thats a shame! My man, Tenzing, had to go to Alchi to camp for the night. Day 4: Ulley  Leh Places visited during the day: Alchi monastery, Basgo monastery, Night stay at: Hotel Kidar, Leh Day 5: Leh - Khardung La  Nubra Valley Places visited during the day: Khardung La, Sumur Monastery, Panamik Hot-water Springs Night stay at: Olgok Guest House, Hunder. The place is decent. The owner a helpful gentleman. But the rooms were damp. The food, contrary to many other peoples opinion, was terrible in taste. Boiled vegetables with a sprinkling of salt! Here I am not complaining about vegetables not being available but about the quality of cooking. Tip: I would humbly suggest to avoid a visit to Sumur and Panamik...unless you have plenty of time on hand. Nothing special about either the drive or the places. Instead, the day saved can be used to extend the Lamayuru trip to include Kargil. Day 6: Hunder  Turtuk  Hunder Places visited during the day: Turtuk village  absolutely stunning with beautiful people. Must visit! Skuru Monastery  In the ground adjacent to the monastery, a group of Ladakhi women had arrived here from Sumur for a day-long picnic. They graciously invited my wife and me to join in their revelry. They treated us to Chhang (local beer made from wheat, it was delicious and strong) and a traditional dance performance. Will never forget their large-heartedness! Hunder Sand Dunes in the evening: A touristy spot. Folks with kids will enjoy here more. Night stay at: Olgok Guest House, Hunder Day 7: Hunder  Diskit  Leh Places visited during the day: Diskit Monastery. The views from here are splendid. Night stay at: Hotel Kidar, Leh Day 8: Leh  Pangong Tso Places visited during the day: Thicksey Monastery, Pangong Tso Day 9: Pangong Tso  Leh Places visited during the day: Hemis Monastery, Stakna Monastery Day 10: Leh  Tso Moriri Places visited during the day: Kiagar Tso, Tso Moriri, Korzok Monastery and Village Day 11: Tso Moriri - Leh Places visited during the day: While we visited Tso Kar Lake, we could not continue the onward journey to Leh via Tanglang La, since the route was closed due to heavy overnight rains. We backed-out and went to Leh via Chumathang. Day 12: Leh Local Sightseeing Places visited during the day: Spituk Monastery + Kali Mata Mandir, Shanti Stupa, Shey Monastery, Leh Market In conclusion, we had a fabulous time in Ladakh. Stunning vistas, beautiful monasteries, affable people, good food, et al. Dont go by my words.
