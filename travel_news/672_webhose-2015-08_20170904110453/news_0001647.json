Hart and his wife checked in at the Northwest Regional Airport near their home in Terrace, B.C. \n“I smiled at the … lady who was holding her [security] wand,” he said, adding that he told the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) employees he had an artificial metal hip. \n“And the words that came out of her mouth were, ‘You’re not going to be able to board this flight. You can’t take this flight. You have to be patted down by male CATSA staff and one is not available.’” \nRelated: Carly Fiorina Gives TSA a Bad Review on Yelp \nHart asked security staff to contact their supervisor and he says he also offered to be patted down by a female CATSA screener, a male Air Canada agent or an RCMP officer. \n“I said, 'What can we do here?’ And [the CATSA screener] said, 'I’m sorry you’re just going to have to book another flight. We’re not prepared to negotiate at all on that.’” \nHart says he was told the small airport’s CATSA crew had only two male screeners, one of whom was on holiday and the other was off duty. He was asked to come back when a male CATSA agent would be on duty, and as a result, his trip was delayed by nine hours. \n“It was just so stunning,” he said. “I couldn’t believe this was happening.” \nCATSA apologizes \nThe Canadian Air Transport Security Authority website states that “a physical search is always done by a screening officer of the same gender as the passenger.” \nBut CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque says there are exceptions and says Hart should have been allowed to board his flight. \n“I can’t disclose these procedures specifically, but there are procedures to have passengers screened when there are no same sex officers,” he told CBC News. \n“We will apologize because it was our mistake. [Hart] should have been screened, he should have been able to get on that plane.” \nLarocque says the agency is now ensuring CATSA staff in Terrace and across the country are aware of these exceptions “so a similar situation does not occur again.” \nHart has accepted CATSA’s apology, but he says he’s still worried about overly zealous security keeping Canadians grounded. \nTo hear the full interview with Robert Hart, click on the audio labelled: Terrace man misses flight because female CATSA agents refuse to pat him down. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
