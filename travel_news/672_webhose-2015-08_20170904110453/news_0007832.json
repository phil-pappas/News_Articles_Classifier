The park marks its 65th anniversary this year and retains a more traditional day-out feel with a clutch of thrill rides joined by a more sedate zoo, featuring a group of photogenic meerkats amongst others. The 286-acre site is set in woodlands but the main village feels compact enough for little legs to explore, making it well suited to pre- and primary school kids. Watch out for fireworks to celebrate the 65th anniversary from October 31 to November 1. • The ultimate guide to the UK's theme parks What's new Thomas Land has benefited from a recent £2.5m investment to add three new rides, including Toby's Tram Express to bring younger kids an entry-level frisson of adrenaline. For us, however, the best new attraction was the short Yogi Bear animated film at the 4D cinema. The special effects ad unexpectedly immersive experience charmed both dad and kids alike. A video of the Shockwave rollercoaster at Drayton Manor Thumbs up The adrenaline-pumping Apocalypse and Maelstrom rides will distract grumbling teens but don’t try them straight after visiting one of the park’s anodyne fast-food joints. Better still, treat yourself to a decent, sit-down meal at the Grill Inn, a T.G.I. Friday’s-style restaurant with locally sourced steaks. There’s a decent adults’ lunch menu for £9.95 (kids’ menu from £6.95). • 50 great days out in the UK For buggy-pushers, there are plenty of well-maintained baby-changing facilities and places to heat up food. If you’re making a weekend of it, the four-star Drayton Manor Hotel is on site and there’s a Camping and Caravanning Club site nearby. Thumbs down Pester-power kiosks for extra wallet-draining activities are de rigueur at most parks but still grate. After spending £5 for three goes to unsuccessfully win a Minion at a fairground stall, I was left with a seriously tearful five-year-old daughter. Would a consolation-prize key ring be too much to ask? Top tips An on-the-day adult ticket costs £36. Save up to £16 by pre booking. Rides open 10.30am but queues form outside the main entrance from 9.30am. So, better make an early start and pre-book lunch at the Grill Inn around noon to beat the school-holiday hordes. The Sodom Coffee Shop in the new Sodor Airport is a quieter spot with decent facilities. It’s also a handy spot to refuel before catching the daily live appearance by the Fat Controller. Prices Adult £20; 4-11 year olds and 60+ £15; under 2s free [if booked a week in advance]. Ask about season passes, which offer unlimited entry and free parking (normally £3). Opening times: gates 9.30am-pm, rides open 10.30am throughout August.
