Pesky ... Mount Raung blows its top again causing ongoing problems for Bali’s tourism industry. Pic: AFP Source: AFP\nA report by Escape Travel , provided exclusively to News Corp Australia, found that trips to Greece surged 18 per cent this month with September and October bookings up eight per cent.\nThe increase comes despite the country’s financial woes resulting in limited availability of cash from ATMs and banks.\nIn contrast, the Bali ash cloud has delivered a severe blow to the Indonesian holiday isle with travellers now looking elsewhere.\nAustralian Federation of Travel Agents CEO Jayson Westbury said the tale of the two destinations spoke volumes about Aussie holiday-makers. Hotspot ... Greece remains a favourite destination for Australian travellers in the wake of the financial crisis.

No dramas ... Joanne Faraos, of Sydney, had a trouble-free holiday in Greece at the peak of the financial crisis.
