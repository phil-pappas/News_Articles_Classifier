Wearing only a well-adjusted loincloth (langot), wrestlers (pelwhans) enter a pit made of clay, often mixed with salt, lemon and ghee (clarified butter). At the end of a workout, wrestlers rest against the walls of the arena, covering their heads and bodies with earth to soak up any perspiration and avoid catching cold. This relaxation ceremony is completed with massages to soothe tired muscles and demonstrate mutual respect\nPhotograph: Alain Schroeder\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close A sauna at 2,800 meters in the heart of the Dolomites at Monte Lagazuoi, Cortina, in the eastern Italian Alps\nPhotograph: Stefano Zardini\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close Traditional haymaking in Poland, where many people continue to use the scythe and pitchfork to sort the hay\nPhotograph: Bartlomiej Jurecki\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close White frost over Pestera village in Romania\nPhotograph: Eduard Gutescu\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Pinterest close A night at Deadvlei, in Namibia. ‘The night before returning to Windhoek, we spent several hours at Deadveli.
