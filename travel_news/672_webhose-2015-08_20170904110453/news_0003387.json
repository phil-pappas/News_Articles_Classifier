We tell you why. \nWhen you think of the best places in the world for winter sports, Canada is right up there. There are very few avid skiers who don't have Alberta or British Columbia on the top of their wish list and skiing in Canada has become one of the most popular winter sports options for international tourists. \nBut it's not just skiing in Canada that gets the nod of approval. There are also myriad opportunities to try some of the slightly more offbeat winter sports like snowboarding (although not quite so offbeat these days!), ski touring, Nordic skiing, ice climbing and even dog sledding. \nBut as well as all the high-energy activities you'll be able to get involved in, there's so much to explore around this gorgeous region on your 'downtime'. Canmore, which is around an hour from Lake Louise and just on the border of the Banff National Park, is a town that's become a very popular stop off for tourists. Its spectacular setting and wonderfully quirky ambience make it well worth exploring – even if it's just from the deck of a microbrewery taking in the views! \nWarm, Welcoming and Full of Atmosphere \nDowntown Canmore has a unique vibe, and its swathe of cafes, boutiques, galleries and restaurants add up to a vibrant yet incredibly laidback community. In terms of what to do, a lot of it revolves around food and entertainment – as would be expected. There's a genuine focus on local organic produce and many of the cafes and restaurants offer specialised vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and all-natural dishes on the menu. But don't worry, it's not all about living clean and healthy! Sometimes you might just feel like something huge and hearty after an energetic day in the snow and Canmore has that in abundance, with restaurants covering everything from French and Brazilian to Mexican and Canadian. \nLocal Beers \nCanmore has a special appeal to anyone interested in craft beer (which, judging by its popularity, is quite a few people), with a number of microbreweries offering tastes and tours. The wonderfully named Grizzly Paw Brewing Company is one of the most high profile, having won a number of awards for its excellent brews. \nEnjoy the Art and Culture \nArt and culture on a holiday skiing in Canada? Well, yes, actually! Canmore has quite a few excellent galleries along the main street and also just on the outskirts of town. There is a very healthy art and performance scene, and the galleries cover everything from folk art to ceramics, sculptures and painting from local and more far-flung artists. \nThe Nordic Centre \nThe Canmore Nordic Centre, just a few minutes from the centre of downtown, offers trails suitable for everyone from beginners to experts. There are over 100kms of trails to explore, with or without the assistance of a local guide (depending on your experience of course). \nThe spectacular region around Lake Louise and the Banff National Park is renowned as one of the best in the world to go skiing in Canada, but it’s the slightly off-the-beaten-track towns like Canmore that give it the true heart and soul for which it is so well-loved.
