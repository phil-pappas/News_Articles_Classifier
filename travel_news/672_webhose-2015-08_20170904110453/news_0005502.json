This project, which introduces regional beverages and cuisine to ANA flights, airport lounges and other services, is designed to raise the profile of Japan’s lesser-known prefectures, particularly to overseas customers, and drive tourism to Japan. The project is also intended to stimulate local economies, in part by boosting consumption of regional agricultural products.\nThe ninth phase of the project will introduce ANA customers to products from Niigata, Kanagawa and Shiga prefectures between September and November 2015. This will include:\nNiigata\nIn first class, passengers can enjoy “compote made with Le Lectier”, a renowned brand of pears from Niigata, as well as pear and raspberry ice cream”. Le Lectier pears are a sought-after fruit and the compote is made by simmering the pears in red wine.\nOther in-flight and airport options include “mille-feuille made with eel (anago) and foie gras”, “caramelized Le Lectier pears from Niigata”, and “Niigata beer”. Kanagawa\nAt the “Dining h” restaurant inside the ANA SUITE LOUNGE at Haneda, diners can order “Yokohama Beef Kuroge Wagyu sirloin steak” in September. This high-quality steak is cooked to order and served together with a Japanese-style sauce. Other in-flight and airport options include “Eggs Benedict served with Shonan pork sausage” and “pudding made from red Sagami eggs”. Shiga\nPassengers in business class can taste local Shiga cuisine. The main dish is “somen noodles served with grilled mackerel”, a local style of noodles from Nagahama, which has been passed down the ages. The simple flavors of the noodles combine with the rich flavors of the mackerel to produce a true delicacy. Other in-flight and airport options include “Omi Wagyu hamburger with cheddar cheese and Madeira wine flavored sauce” and “white chocolate mousse and Shiga blueberry jam served with a waffle”. Airport Lounges: Japanese Sake Corner\nAs part of the project, ANA customers are able to sample Japanese sake, shochu and awamori, the ‘Kokushu’ or national spirits of Japan, at ANA airport lounges in Haneda, Narita and Kansai Airports.\nSource:- ANA", "external_links": ["http://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/press/2015/image/150810-3.jpg", "http://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/press/2015/image/150810-4.jpg", "http://www.ana.co.jp/eng/aboutana/press/2015/image/150810-2.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:06:23.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
