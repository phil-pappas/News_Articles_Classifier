Three-plus security checkpoints later I was herded into a holding pen with the rest of the media. Much like the first day of high school you can pick the new kids on the block. While the veterans read newspapers on deck chairs they’d brought from home, the newbies were too scared to take photos at risk of causing a security breach.\nSECURITY\nSpeaking of security, Secret Service Officers are everywhere. You know how I knew that they were secret? Their uniforms are emblazoned with the words, “Secret Service”, which seems a little counterintuitive to me. However, they are heavy armed. What kind of weaponry, you ask? No idea. Unlike their uniforms, they didn’t have names written on them.\nPRESS BRIEFING ROOM\nThe hallowed grounds of the likes of Mike McLintock and C.J. Cregg, the Press Briefing Room is where a lot of important people ask questions about very important things. I was neither of those things. Under the dozens of LED lights that lit up the semi-submerged room, journalists buzzed about making phone calls, others furiously filed stories in crammed quarters and cameramen repeatedly conducted audio and visual checks — ready for a press conference that wasn’t scheduled for at least a couple of hours.\nIt looks much bigger on TV.

Ushered from the depths of the Press Briefing Room, we entered through the north portico, aka the front door. Unfortunately, Michelle and Barack weren’t there welcome us — neither did Bo and Sunny come bounding to the door.\nSWEET TUNES\nInstead, as the doors to the Entrance Hall opened up, the sweet sounds of the US Marine Band tickled my ears. Just a handful of the team known as “The President’s Own” were on hand. I’m not sure what was more impressive; their immaculately pressed uniforms or the guitarist slapping the bass — the tunes were classic and they didn’t take requests.\nTHE GRAND FOYER\nI walked across the marble floors where John Travolta and Lady Diana once famously waltzed. I wasn’t as light on my feet though, as I was distracted by the portraits of former Presidents that adorned the walls of the Grand Staircase that led up to the Obama’s private quarters.\nNO FREE WI-FI\nThe United States may be leaders of the free world but forget about logging onto the President’s network.\nTHE EAST ROOM\nIt’s no West Wing but the East Room in The White House plays host the most. In many respects, it’s just a big rectangular room, which makes it perfectly versatile for events ranging from policy announcements to performances from Stevie Wonder. Today, it was welcoming WNBA Champions the Phoenix Mercury.\nWaiting for the Big-O. Source: Supplied\nIt’s a full house.

After a long build up, the loudspeaker bellowed, “Ladies and Gentleman, The President of the United States of America!” On cue, POTUS bounded out from backstage, pointing and laughing with the crowd that would’ve clapped louder if they weren’t so busy fumbling around for their phones to take the perfect Instagram shot.\n#Obama #WhiteHouse #Where’sthefreewifiObama? Source: Supplied\nTHAT’S A LOT OF GRASS\nFrom afar The White House may look tiny but that’s really because it’s in the middle of 18 acres of land. It takes 13 green thumbs to keep the garden looking tiptop. It appears they take their jobs very seriously — one of the groundskeepers was dismayed that her lawn mowing was put on hold when our festivities moved outside.\nPATIENCE IS A VIRTUE\nIn total, I was on The White House grounds for more than three hours. The official proceedings lasted 10 minutes.\n ", "external_links": ["http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22&title=Inside+the+White+House%3A+Things+that+surprised+me", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22&h=Inside+the+White+House%3A+Things+that+surprised+me", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Inside+the+White+House%3A+Things+that+surprised+me&c=TODAY+I+stepped+inside+the+most+famous+house+in+America.+While+I%26%238217%3Bd+studied+up+on+what+to+expect%2C+the+President%26%238217%3Bs+home+was+still+full+of+surprises.&u=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-ideas/inside-the-white-house-things-that-surprised-me/story-fnjpj945-1227504432490?sv=cfd17f077b8eb3478a489cd3e0a8cb22&title=Inside+the+White+House%3A+Things+that+surprised+me"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T17:22:54.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
