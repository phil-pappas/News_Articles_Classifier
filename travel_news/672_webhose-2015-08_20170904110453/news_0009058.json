LIQUID INVESTMENTS: Sometimes the proprietor’s personality shines through the wine LIQUID INVESTMENT: The murky world of wine listing rewards LIQUID INVESTMENT: Saronsberg vertical tasting reveals how wines stand the test of time RAZVAN Macici, whose tenure as cellarmaster at Nederburg saw dramatic improvements in the quality of SA’s best-known premium wine brand, has been appointed chief winemaker at Distell, the country’s largest wine and spirits business.\nSince Distell owns Nederburg, no doubt Nederburg will maintain its trajectory. It is also likely that the other Distell wine brands will profit from the skills and insights Macici used to reverse the slide precipitated at Nederburg by his predecessor. The difference is that most of the other Distell wine brands are better off now than Nederburg was when he arrived (though of some of the smaller estates such as Alto, Neethlingshof and Le Bonheur will be better off for his attention).\nAt Distell the issue is much less one of winemaking and much more one of image among wine buffs. The company has been in the front rank of quality production — certainly since Linley Schultz took over as chief winemaker and tightened up on vineyard management and fruit handling.\nWhile it’s easy to buy a decent wine from most of Distell’s cellars, it’s less easy to persuade the punters that it’s safe to serve them in an environment where snobbery takes precedence over good old-fashioned taste.\nNowhere was this dichotomy more evident than at the tasting for this year’s Nederburg Auction. The line-up obviously includes the cuvées made by Macici and his team specially for the annual Paarl sale, as well as a broad range from many of the Cape’s top producers.\nThe Nederburg wines stood out: the Bin 234 was one of the most complex and finely balanced of the sauvignon blancs, the Bin 181 2006 the best of a bad bunch of merlots, the Bin R115 Shiraz-Cabernet 2004 one of the most harmonious of the red blends, while the dessert wines showed their utter domination of the sweet wine classes. In short, Nederburg’s problem is not one of what goes into the bottle, but what is written on the label — and this is a combination of poor marketing decisions coupled with Nederburg having become a victim of its own success.\nWhile there is a Nederburg range for every occasion, it proves the old marketing adage that you can’t be all things to all men.\nNames like The Manor House, The Young Airhawk, Winemaster, The Brewmaster and The Foundation Collection tell you that while Macici was working his magic in the cellar, the marketers were face deep in white powder.\nBack to the auction tasting. While you may have to pick your way around the frogs, this year’s Nederburg Auction has plenty of princes-in-waiting: the three-litre JC Le Roux Pinot Noir 1989 is a brilliant Champagne-like bubbly worth chasing down if you are planning a big party, as is the three-litre Anura 2008.\nAmong the sauvignons, the Nederburg Bin 234 2013 shone alongside the Diemersdal 8 Rows 2011, the Graham Beck Pheasant’s Run 2013, and the Bloemendal Suider Terras 2013. In the chenin blancs, the Raats 2006 was the standout wine, though the De Morgenzon 2012 and the Stellenrust 47 2011 were pretty smart. There was a lovely 2003 Nederburg Semillon and some fine chardonnays, notably the 2006 Dewetshof \"The Site\", the 2009 Dewetshof Bataleur and a sumptuous Paul Cluver 2009.\nThe red wines were more of a mixed bag. The Webersburg Cabernet 2004 is brilliant and the Kanonkop Paul Sauer 2005 a sound bet. As for the dessert wines, you could safely buy any one of the Nederburgs, though the Eminence 2008 was my favourite. Among the fortifieds — the Monis Marsala 1983, the Nuy red Muscadel 2000 and the Boplaas Cape Vintage 2012 would get my money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T05:51:55.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
