Australian actor and model Sunny Burns has handed himself into police amid claims on social media he was the suspect in the Bangkok bombing. Picture: Sunny Burns, Instagram. Source: Supplied \nAN AUSTRALIAN model and actor claims to have handed himself in to Thai police amid rumours he was the Bangkok bombing suspect pictured on CCTV. \nSunny Burns posted a picture of himself on his Instagram and Facebook accounts saying he was talking with police and being treated well. \n“I forgive everyone who spread those horrible rumours about me,” he said. “I love this country and let’s fight together. Let’s find this bomber. I’m not a terrorist.” Sunny Burns <div class=\"iframe-alt\">(Frame content direct link: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/6hJ26vTSNL/embed\">http://instagram.com/p/6hJ26vTSNL/embed</a>.)</div> \nBurns claims to have handed himself in after an image comparing him to the suspect began to circulate online.

I would never wear those clothing [sic] — I’m a fashion blogger ... I’ll keep you posted but please pray for Thailand. I’m Australian and we are battlers ... I still love you Thailand,” he wrote online.

Prawut Thavornsiri told AP the “yellow shirt guy is not just the suspect. He is the bomber.” \nThe government has also said the suspect is from an “anti-government group based in Thailand’s northeast” which is a stronghold for the red shirt movement who are opposed to the military-run government. \nHowever political experts warned government claims about the alleged attacker need to be taken with a grain of salt. \nLondon School of Economics Professor Tim Forsyth, who specialises in Thailand and South East Asia, said it conveniently allocates blame for the attack for which no one has claimed responsibility so far. \n“In the last few hours the Thai government has said they’ve seen someone on CCTV who looks Middle Eastern walking into the shrine with a rucksack and coming out without the rucksack,” he told news.com.au . \n“I don’t know, obviously, but it sounds ridiculously contrived to me.” \n“I rather suspect that the military government will be under pressure to come up with a nice fast digestible explanation for this so blaming it on Islamic terrorists sounds wonderful, but we’ll have to see.” The CCTV image police believe is the suspect.

Source: AP \nLondon’s Queen Mary University senior lecturer in international relations Dr Lee Jones said while he hasn’t seen any evidence so far, it's “far too early” to be pointing fingers. \n“It’s very convenient for a quite beleaguered military regime to say ‘well the security situation in Bangkok is so bad we’re going to have to stay in power.’” \n“It suits the regime to rush to judgment and blame the red shirts and give itself an excuse to cling to power but we need to see the evidence really.” \nDr Jones said there are four “broad possibilities” for who could be behind the bombing. \nOne is the red shirts of the country’s northeast, who staged a demonstration at the same intersection the bombing took place in 2010 where 90 lives were lost. The group is largely made up of poor rural and urban people loyal to the previous Shinawatra government. They have been blamed for bombings on government buildings before — though never ones that target foreigners. \nThe second is the Muslim insurgency in the south of the country where more than 6000 people have died since 2004. However, an attack outside of the southern provinces for this group would also be a first. \nThe third is an Islamic State or al-Qaeda style extremist attack. However, as no-one has come forward to claim responsibility, Dr Jones said it lacks the “hallmarks” of the group. The fourth possibility is some kind of “wildcard” such as retribution for a recent decision to return Muslim Uighur refugees to China. Red Shirts march in Bangkok in 2011.
