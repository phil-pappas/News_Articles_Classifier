By Swati Pandey REUTERS • Monday August 3, 2015 11:54 PM Associated Press A piece of plane debris washed up on the island of Reunion. \nSYDNEY — Barnacles encrusted on a piece of plane debris that washed up on the French island of Reunion might help unravel the mystery of missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 that disappeared last year with 239 passengers and crew on board. \nMalaysia said on Sunday the piece of debris, a 6 1/2-by-8-foot wing surface known as flaperon, had been identified as being from a Boeing 777, the same model as the missing Malaysian plane. Investigators in France are expected to determine whether the piece came from Flight 370 by Wednesday. \nFlight 370 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, about 2,300 miles from Reunion. \nBased on photographs, ecologists in Australia think the crustaceans clinging to the wing piece are goose or stalk barnacles. \n“Barnacle shells … can tell us valuable information about the water conditions under which they were formed,” said Ryan Pearson, a Ph.D. student at Australia’s Griffith University who is studying the shell chemistry of barnacles to determine migration patterns of endangered loggerhead turtles. \nBarnacles can be aged, based on growth rates and size. If the barnacles on the debris are older than the date Flight 370 went missing, it would rule it coming from that plane, said Melanie Bishop a professor at the Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University in Sydney. \nMarine archaeologists study barnacles for clues about shipwrecks but this is thought to be the first time they will be studied for an airliner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T08:01:19.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
