Each year the ATTA invites companies to share anonymous information about their business from the previous fiscal year. For the 2015 report, over 500 tour operators were surveyed in sixty-seven countries.\nThe ATTA has been involved in original and collaborative research since 2006 as part of its mission of educating and professionalizing the adventure travel industry. The Industry Snapshot includes up-to-date information about trending destinations, activities and industry business practices. The Snapshot is offered for free to ATTA members and can be purchased and downloaded by anyone in the travel community.\nThe 2015 report provides regional data, allowing readers to easily see at a glance how individual markets are changing compared to others. The report includes which region has the most outbound clients per year, the greatest increase in average trip price over last year and the greatest percentage increase in gross revenue for 2014.\n“Readers of previous Industry Snapshots will notice the emphasis on regional reporting in the new version,” said Christina Beckmann, ATTA’s Director of Research. “We see the adventure travel industry expanding and changing and in many different ways, and recognize that global averages can obscure important regional differences.”\nLast year the ATTA launched a new online store where association members and other organizations in the travel industry can download original research papers and data. As a benefit to members of the ATTA, many downloads are available free of charge, while others within the industry community can purchase research “a la carte” through the new area of the AdventureTravel.biz website.\nSource:- ATTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T22:15:51.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
