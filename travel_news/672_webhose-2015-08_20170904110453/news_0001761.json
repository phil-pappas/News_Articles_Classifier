(H.P.) Rama, chairman of the board and CEO of JHM Hotels, will be honored with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the Americas Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS), January 25-27, 2016, in Los Angeles. This prominent award is presented to an individual who has made significant contributions to the hospitality industry over his or her lifetime through their actions, deeds, and great accomplishments.\nRama’s story is a true example of achieving the American dream. Rama was born in Africa, raised in India, and came to the US in order to pursue his MBA from Xavier University with only two dollars to his name. He has been surrounded by the hotel industry his entire life – from washing dishes to leading the largest hotel association in the world, Rama has built a name for himself as a successful businessman and hotelier.\nHard work, commitment, and spiritual strength have been the building blocks of the JHM Hotels brand. What began as a single 40-room motel in Pomona, California in 1973, has grown to be among the top fifty hotel management companies in the U.S. JHM employs over 1700 associates and currently owns and operates 40 hotels, representing franchises with over 7,000 rooms in six states. Additionally, JHM owns and operates a five-star hotel in Surat, India.\nIn addition to his work as a hotelier, Rama is known for his community involvement and philanthropy in the U.S. and India. Corporate social responsibility is a core value at JHM Hotels, with a focus on educational opportunities for the underserved, poverty relief, and community enrichment. Each year JHM Hotels donates to more than 40 charities in communities where they have hotels, and their associates rack up hundreds of volunteer hours. In 1998, the company established “The Rama Scholarship for the American Dream”, which has benefited more than 350 students pursuing careers in hospitality management, and in August 2011, opened AURO University in Gujarat, India. In addition, the Rama’s have focused on improving communities in India by adopting a village, building a primary school, installing a water purification plant, developing a children’s park, and supporting an eye hospital.\nRama is also a founding chairman of the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA) and past chairman of the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA). His commitment to excellence has won him numerous awards including the Excellence and Inspiration Award, the ISHC Pioneer Award, and the International Businessperson of the Year Award.\n“H.P.’s story truly embodies the epitome of our industry – a story of hard work, achievements, and success. An immigrant from India, his story paints the picture of how endless possibilities and opportunities can lead to achieving the American dream,” said Katherine Lugar, president and CEO of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. “Coupled with his foresight and effortless leadership skills, H.P.’s passion and diligence led him to where he is today, the chairman and CEO of one of the top management companies in the industry. As a former chair of AH&LA and founding member and chair of AAHOA, there is no one who deserves this award more than H.P. On behalf of the entire industry, we congratulate H.P. on his countless achievements.”\n“H.P. is a true visionary and highly respected among his peers around the world,” said Jim Burba, president of BHN and chair of ALIS. “He not only built a very successful company, but also strengthened the hotel industry with his tireless efforts in supporting the industry’s leading trade associations. His outstanding leadership in improving communities and educating future leaders both in the U.S. and India continues to remind all of us of the positive impact we can make. It is truly an honor to be presenting the ALIS Lifetime Achievement Award to H.P. Rama,” Burba added.\nCo-hosted by the American Hotel & Lodging Association (AH&LA) and Burba Hotel Network (BHN), the two-and-a-half-day ALIS event features an extensive array of seminars and panels hosted by leading experts and investors discussing important trends and identifying new opportunities. The conference attracts the lodging industry’s leading hotel executives, investors, lenders, developers and professional advisory community. Proceeds benefit the educational, research, and training missions of the Educational Institute (EI) of the American Hotel & Lodging Education Foundation (AH&LEF), AH&LA’s not-for-profit affiliate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:11:21.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
