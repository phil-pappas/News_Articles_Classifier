When upgraded next month, the crossings will have full-length barriers with radar technology used to check if the road is clear.\nA Network Rail spokesman said: “When we have rebuilt these crossings they will have new obstacle detection kit that will scan the road with radar to check it is safe to lower the barriers. Safety is our top priority and this work will not only improve safety for road users but also reliability.\n“Network Rail has a national programme of level crossing closures and improvements, to increase safety on the railway for passengers and motorists. In fact, we have closed more than 900 in the past five years and where we cannot close them, we make improvements such as these.”\nAs a result of the work needed for the upgrades, Network Rail will have to temporarily close the roads, with diversions via West Tytherley. Drivers are urged to plan ahead to avoid delays.The work on Dean Hill level crossing, on East Dean Road, will be complete by the end of September, while Dean crossing, on Rectory Hill, will be complete by the end of October.\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:11:10.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
