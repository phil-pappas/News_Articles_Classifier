These tools empower suppliers to conduct compliance testing at the point of software creation, significantly reducing implementation errors, Q/A overhead, and speeding time to market. \n\"We are very proud of the fact that GSA's G2S® protocol is the new standard for the global gaming industry. Now with CVT 1.0 and CVT 2.0, suppliers have an automated way to quickly and precisely ensure games and systems are properly implementing G2S. The verification tools will dramatically benefit suppliers,\" said GSA Protocol Director Ethan Tower. \nCVT 1.0 is a Practical EGM Compliance Tester, an easy-to-use tool that anyone can use to run a set of standard tests against an EGM to ensure it has correctly implemented the critical requirements of the core classes of GSA's award-winning Game-to-System G2S standard. Conversely, the CVT 2.0 Practical Host Compliance Tester can be used to run a set of standard tests against a G2S Host to ensure it has correctly implemented the critical requirements of the core classes of the G2S protocol. \nConducting this type of practical testing at the supplier's development site can greatly reduce formal independent testing labs testing times and further speed time to market. \n\"With CVT 1.0 and CVT 2.0, there are now tools that provide repeatable results and significantly reduce implementation errors. We expect these tools will generate immediate and significant value for the industry. That is precisely what GSA was created to do. These new tools are a direct fulfillment of GSA's brand promise and value proposition,\" Tower said. \nThe CVT 1.0 and CVT 2.0 tools were thoroughly vetted by GSA's Certification and Interoperability Committee over a period of 12 months. Those processes proved the tools operate exactly as intended, correctly testing all critical requirements of the core classes of the G2S standard.
