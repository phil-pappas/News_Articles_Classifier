I'm telling you, put Tinker Bell or Remy from \"Ratatouille\" atop this and you have serious foodietainment. \nJust around the corner, another chef was just as impressive with a rapid-fire folding of cheese, ham and bread to prep dozens of Croque Monsieur sandwiches. It was a demonstration of extreme manual dexterity. \nWhen the old bakery closed, that space was converted into L'Artisan des Glaces, which typically has 10 flavors of ice cream available, alongside four sorbets and two varieties of macaroon-and-ice-cream sandwiches. \nThe ice cream is made on the premises and served two days later, precisely at 10 degrees Fahrenheit for the perfect scooping, Weistroffer says. \n\"They make it all day long,\" he says. \nA recent creation at L'Artisan des Glaces is a lemon ice cream surrounding white-chocolate-covered bits of meringue. The chocolate chip mint has a couple of surprises: It's not green, and it has real mint in it. You can smell it. Never before have I been delighted by a grassy ice cream. \n\"There are so many ice creams out there we have to stand out,\" Weistroffer says. \nAnother way: the ice-cream martini, which is two scoops, a shot of Grand Marnier and whipped-cream vodka or rum. It sells for $11.50. \nToo rich for your blood? A single homemade dip at L'Artisan des Glaces is $4.22. \nThe prepackaged Mickey's Premium, also known as the Mickey Bar and is found across Walt Disney World, is $4.25. The Mickey Bar is a simple pleasure, vanilla dipped in chocolate, but I'm going to think twice next time I'm in France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:26:39.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
