It could be that a product has been found to be defective, or that a director has been discovered stealing, or that a contract was not awarded properly, an accident in the workplace or an employee revealing defamatory information – whatever it is, if it has become public knowledge then you need to act fast to protect your reputation. According to a study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 75 per cent of a company’s market value is linked to its reputation. First, appoint an articulate spokesperson and make them available for comment across all media channels including social media. If necessary, create a special hotline phone number that customers can call for information. Be honest about what has happened and explain what you are doing to fix the problem. Pretending everything is fine could end up doing more harm than was caused by the original crisis Then, if need be, provide regular updates. Pretending that everything is fine could backfire and end up doing more harm than was caused by the original crisis. Keep your staff informed too. When a crisis hits they are often the last to know, which can create confusion. But consider restricting employees’ social media access if disaster strikes, to prevent them sharing information inappropriately. Ideally, you should have prepared a contingency plan long before a crisis hits. Write an action plan document that includes practical details such as essential telephone numbers, key facts about the company and details of where staff should meet if the workplace is inaccessible. Be sure to back up all your data regularly in case you are unable to access it in the usual way. You should also consider taking out reputation insurance. A growing number of specialist brokers now offer this kind of insurance, but make sure you read the small print. Some policies only cover the cost of paying for business consultancy or public relations advice, while others also cover the financial losses of a fall in revenue or profits. Phil Hall is former editor of the News of the World newspaper and now chairman of PR Agency PHA Media. He says: “If there is a media threat to you or your company’s reputation then the secret is to act quickly, even if it is to say nothing at all. It is far better to be on the front foot and as proactive as is feasible.” He continues: “It is crucial to inform whoever handles your PR of the situation so that they can begin the ‘firefighting’ process. Employing a PR who knows the high-level journalists and editors is of huge benefit as it enables them to cut through the layers of journalists and executives on a newspaper and get to the decision maker. In the digital age, news is a 24-hour service, which places added importance on reacting quickly to a media storm. \"Stories have the ability to spread faster than ever through various online platforms and will no longer simply become ‘tomorrow’s fish and chip paper’. After this initial surge in reading and subsequent sharing, these stories will forever remain online. They are often the first thing you see when searching for an individual or company, which leaves reputations in tatters long after the stories are published.” Hall concludes: “The best way to protect your company’s brand or your own image from a crisis is to prepare for it. If you find yourself in the media spotlight as the result of a mistake, error, false allegation or accident the chances of avoiding a full-blown media storm are greatly increased if you have a full and robust crisis communications plan in place.” • However great your reputation, the right company car, financed in the best way, makes good sense for your business.
