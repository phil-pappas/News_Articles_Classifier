As Disneyland continues to make headlines this summer with its 60th anniversary celebration and the announcement of a $1 billion facelift , we couldn't help but wonder: How much does it actually cost for a family to vacation at the \"Happiest Place on Earth\"? And what about its larger, East Coast cousin, Disney World? Is one location \"happier\"--at least where one's wallet is concerned? \nWe posed the question on Twitter and received responses that varied from a meme of Austin Powers' Dr. Evil to a concise \"Too much.\" Real world estimates ranged from $200 per person per day, excluding travel at Disneyland, to $3,500 for a five-day trip to Disney World, including airfare. \nTo find a concrete answer, we analyzed our 2015 data for average flight prices to Anaheim and Orlando from the 30 most popular airports in the U.S., in addition to the average prices for hotel stays in Anaheim and Lake Buena Vista (the city in which Disney World is located). We also looked at the average prices for Disney Resort Hotels and, just for fun, how much it would cost for the daily consumption of Tiki Juice Bar classics. Because, hello. Dole Pineapple Whip. \nBut here's the problem with trying to gather data on Disney theme parks, to which any seasoned visitor can attest: there's just so many available options--which is probably why the answers we received on Twitter differed greatly. \nTo provide any meaningful insight, we decided to define the parameters of a Disney vacation to mean a four day/four night stay for a family of four with two children ages 3-9 (Tickets in both parks for children 10 and older are equal in price to an adult ticket). \nLet's take a look at what we what we found: \nThe columns on the far right and left represent the base prices, meaning on average, a family of four will spend more than $3,000 on travel, accommodations, and park admission at either location. Disney World is about $250 less expensive, however-- and those are savings that can make a big difference when on a budget. \nNow, as represented by the inner two columns, if said family wanted to stay at a Disney Resort Hotel instead of an outside hotel, there's a good chance those price will raise drastically.
