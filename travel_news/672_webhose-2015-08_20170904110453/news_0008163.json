Banksy’s new 'Dismaland' is a dark take on the childhood classic. Picture: Press Association. Source: Supplied \nGRAFFITI artist Banksy has opened what could be the world’s most terrifying theme park at a seaside town on the English coast. \nFrom today, the Tropicana abandoned outdoor park at Weston-super-mare near Bristol will be transformed into Dismaland , a “bemusement park” with a dark twist on California’s childhood classics. \nIt features a dystopian take on Splash Mountain known as Water Cannon Creek, where an armour-plated riot vehicle used in Northern Ireland has been turned into a children’s slide. \nThere is also a caliphate-themed “Mini Gulf” course and Punch and Judy show featuring Jimmy Saville and Fifty Shades of Grey. \nVisitors can have the back of their head drawn in a “surprisingly revealing” portrait or watch the weekly events including live comedy and music from Russian punk activists Pussy Riot. Don’t mind the seagulls. Picture: Press Association. Source: Supplied Cinderella with a different ending. Picture: Press Association Source: Supplied \nThe abandoned site also includes boats overloaded with refugees and scary twists on classics like The Little Mermaid and is produced with the help of artist from all over the world. \nIt was produced under top secret conditions, with a cover-story that it was the location for a film called Grey Fox madeby Atlas Productions. The Little Mermaid gets a makeover. Picture: Press Association Source: Supplied While a boat pond delivered a twist on the ‘small world’ theme. Picture: Press Association Source: Supplied An elaborate cover story was concocted to dampen speculation about the event. Source: Snapper Media \nDismaland is one of the largest outdoor installation for the mystterious artist whose satirical work has gained heritage-listed status around the UK and gained fans like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. \nDespite his fame, Banksy has remained fiercely protective of his identity and committed to outdoor stunts, including one in New York where he sold his pictures at a stall near Central Park for a fraction of what they would cost in a gallery. \nDismaland runs from 22 August to 27 September and the site contains a warning that spray paint, knives and “legal representatives of the Walt Disney Corporation” are strictly prohibited in the park.
