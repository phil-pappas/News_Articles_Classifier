Morgan did not inherit an artistic tradition, but having been soundly trained in his craft, he lamented that these “traditions have been destroyed or disregarded” and that many major art schools “seem to have abandoned the teaching of techniques in drawing and painting … It does not uplift the human spirit. It denies it.” Landscape with Four Birds (2014) by Glyn Morgan Glyn Morgan was born on July 16 1926 in Pontypridd, Glamorgan, at the junction of the Taff and Rhondda valleys, where “a fully loaded coal train went past the front of our house every five minutes.” Although his paternal grandfather had been a miner, Glyn’s father, Henry Ivor Morgan, instead joined the Great Western Railway, becoming main booking office chief clerk in Cardiff. He was an enterprising man, building bungalows and owning newsagent shops, one looked after by his wife, Gladys. During a happy childhood, young Glyn began filling up drawing books, sent to him by his Oxford-educated brother Trevor, with “cars, planes, trains and numerous pictures of the liner Queen Mary”. He also constructed “altars of gravel with flower and leaf offerings”, presaging some of his mature Offerings and Table of Minos pictures. Morgan’s artistic leanings were encouraged at Pontypridd Grammar School. Then, after taking his examinations at 16, he was accepted as a student by Cardiff College of Art in 1942. It was a fortunate move. An important influence was Ceri Richards – “a marvellous teacher” – remembered for his life classes. “The power of his concentration was palpable,” Morgan recalled. Richards, who had worked as an illustrator in London, introduced Morgan and fellow-students to modern artists such as Picasso and Augustus John through reproductions and visits to Cardiff Museum. It was there that he first set eyes on a picture by Cedric Morris, who provided Morgan with artistic inspiration for the rest of his life. When Morris came to judge a show organised by Esther Grainger at Pontypridd, the 17-year-old Morgan entered two pictures. Morris thought his work promising and invited him to his school in Suffolk. In the summer of 1944, the year he left Cardiff College of Art, Morgan booked a week at Benton End, formally known as The East Anglian School of Drawing and Painting. Self Portrait by Glyn Morgan, circa 1954 There he enjoyed daily “two enormous meals, with wine and breakfast and tea”, cooked by Morris’s artist-partner Lett Haines. He also delighted in conversation with fellow students and interesting guests. Morris was a notable plantsman who had opened the school with Haines in 1937. As a self-confessed “highly emotional romantic”, Morgan recalled that “it was just a lovely place to be.” After his initial visit, Morgan visited Benton End whenever he could for 38 years. Morris later painted a portrait of Morgan, and Colchester and Ipswich Museums Service holds Morgan’s late-1950s oil on board Cedric Morris in his Garden. In 1985, Morgan organised The Benton End Circle exhibition of more than 40 years’ work by students of Morris and Haines at Bury St Edmunds Art Gallery. He also contributed a chapter to the book Benton End Remembered, published in 2002. Another legacy of Benton End was his membership, from 1988-1998, of the Society of Botanical Artists. He attending Camberwell School of Art from 1947 to 1948. He found it overcrowded and the teaching unsympathetic (one exception being John Minton, “a charming man, and a most energetic and inspiring teacher”). Subsequent, to earn money, Morgan taught at Ruabon Grammar School in North Wales and gave evening classes at High Wycombe School of Art. He also directed summer courses at Flatford Mill Field Centre in Suffolk, Nettlecombe Court, Somerset, and Aegina Arts Centre in Greece. He continued until, in his own words, he became “arthritic and deaf”, but always considered himself “a painter who happened to be teaching. I didn’t like teaching, but tried to do it as well as I could.” Song of the Earth X (2004) by Glyn Morgan Morgan first visited Greece in 1963, after being absorbed in the Iliad and the Odyssey. A six-month Goldsmiths’ Company award five years later took him to Crete, and over the next few years the Table of Minos and Orpheus series enriched his output, as did his love of music. He would listen to Radio 3 all the time as he worked in his garden studio, and Mahler’s The Song of the Earth from 2003 spawned a string of powerful, richly coloured landscapes. From 2004, the legend of Blodeuwedd, taken from the Mabinogion, a collection of mainly 14th-century Welsh stories, was a constant preoccupation. Painting, however, did not come easily to Morgan. In 1994, on the occasion of the “Master and Pupil” show of his and Morris’s work at Chappel Galleries, near Colchester, Quote: : “My pictures were, and still are, a battlefield.” He contrasted this with Morris’s apparent ease of execution. “Basically he was a realist – a sort of realist, anyway,” he explained, “whereas I am dealing with other sorts of vision.” Morgan had numerous solo exhibitions, including seven retrospectives, one at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 2006. Chappel Galleries championed his work from the mid-1990s, with a last show there in 2014. His paintings are held in several public collections. Glyn Morgan married Jean Bullworthy, whom he met through teaching, in 1958. They lived for 35 years in Buckinghamshire, but when she retired in the mid-1990s they made the decision to move permanently to Hadleigh, near Benton End. His wife survives him.
