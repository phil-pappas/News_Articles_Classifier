The line has unveiled more than a dozen Crystal Overland Adventures for its 102-day “Grand Pacific Panorama” voyage, highlighting some of the destinations’ – and the world’s – most stunning and fascinating sites.

Among the captivating options are:\nThe Kingdom of Bhutan (2 nights from Laem Chebang/Bangkok) – Travelers can observe the customs of the last remaining Buddhist Kingdom, set within the Himalayas at 8,000 feet and completely isolated from outside visitors until a few decades ago.\nThe Temples of Angkor Wat (2 nights from Sihanoukville) – This magnificent complex of temples has earned UNESCO World Heritage status, offering travelers a glimpse into the Cambodian way of life and millennia of spiritual history that still shape it.\nBeijing and the Great Wall (2 nights from Xiamen) – One of the Seven Wonders of the World, China’s Great Wall, is a highlight of this intrepid excursion, with additional visits to other exceptional landmarks including Tiananmen Square and Beijing’s spectacular Summer Palace and the adjacent Forbidden City.\nXi’an & Terra Cotta Warriors Adventure (2 nights from Xiamen) –Guests can travel to Xi’an for a chance to encounter one of the greatest archaeological finds of the last century, the Terra Cotta Warriors and discover some of the other sights of the city, including the Big Wild Goose Pagoda.\nGiant Pandas and Treasures of Chengdu (1 night from Shanghai) – Guests will have the chance to explore the charming culture of Chengdu, which includes ancient temples, cuisine worthy of its status as a UNESCO City of Gastronomy, the acclaimed Sichuan Opera and the Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding – where participants will witness the study and preservation efforts overseen there, and perhaps hold a baby panda.\n“Crystal travel adventures need not be limited to wherever the ship is located,” says President and CEO Edie Rodriguez. “It is always our goal to offer experiences that surpass guests’ expectations and offer experiences beyond what they’ve seen and done before; the Crystal Overland Adventures are a wonderful way to dive deeper into destinations.”\nCrystal Overland Adventures explore Australia’s majestic Ayers Rock and other rock formations within Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, as well as to the country’s bustling capital city of Canberra where guest visit the NASA Deep Space Communication Complex for some interplanetary enrichment. This adventure concludes with a hot-air balloon ride over the city, so travelers can revel in the beauty of the destination from above.\nSailing round-trip from San Francisco on January 24, the 102-day “Grand Pacific Panorama” voyage sails through the South Pacific and Australia before cruising a comprehensive route through China, Japan and Southeast Asia en route back to North America via Alaska.
