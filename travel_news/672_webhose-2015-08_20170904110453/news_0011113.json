The Law Enforcement Torch Run Plane Pull is open to teams from law enforcement agencies, fire departments, private companies, high schools, colleges, fraternal groups and teams of friends and family.\nCheck-in begins at 7:30 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 19, at the Old Signature Ramp at O’Hare International Airport and team captains can turn in their donations and pick up their T-shirts and other materials. New teams can still sign up that morning.\nTeams will be divided into three different divisions – Open Division is ideal for companies, school teams, church groups, clubs, friends and families; Public Safety Division is for law enforcement officers, firefighters, EMTs, DNR, DOC and military personnel; and the Hotel Division created by popular demand. Each team of 20 will attempt to pull the plane a distance of 12 feet, with the top finisher from each division facing off for one final pull to determine the Grand Champion. To participate, each team is asked to raise a minimum of $1,000 ($50 per person) for Special Olympics Illinois. Teams raising more will be eligible for incentive prizes at the $2,500, $4,000 and $6,000 levels.\nUPS and United Airlines are Presenting Sponsors of the 2015 Law Enforcement Torch Run Plane Pull. Other sponsors are Chicago Department of Aviation, City of Chicago, HMS Host, Durham School Services, Barilla Pasta and IlliniCare Health. Because Special Olympics athletes compete free of charge, all money raised by the Plane Pull will directly assist in their training and competition.\nSource:- CDA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:56:45.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
