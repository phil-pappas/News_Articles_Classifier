The most important industries providing the highest economic benefit to the Eyre Peninsula were accommodation and other retail trade.\n“This report is the first time such comprehensive analysis of the state’s regions has been compiled. Overall it shows tourism directly employed 32,100 South Australians in 2013-14 and of that, 11,700 people were directly employed by tourism in regional South Australia,” he said.\n“There is also a further 14,900 indirect employees in regional SA, bringing the total of regional state tourism employment up to 26,600.\n“The State Government knows the significance of the visitor economy in our regions. That’s why in this year’s State Budget we allocated an unprecedented $35 million over two years to promote South Australia to domestic and key international markets, to secure new major events and conferences and create thousands of tourism-related jobs.”\nThe funding includes $14 million on growing tourism marketing opportunities in China, India and South East Asia as well as traditional markets of the United Kingdom, Europe, the United States and New Zealand and $6 million on marketing campaigns to promote Adelaide and regional tourism experiences to the Australian market.\nSource:- South Australian Tourism Commission", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:12:36.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
