Tourists from several countries are among the dead and injured in last night's terror bomb attack.

It's a standard respect every Thai showed when driving or walking by the Erawan Shrine . \nThis shrine is Hindi in origin, but Thai's have adopted it as their own. Thai people and tourists from every corner of the world visit this shrine often to pray in respect to the four face Buddha. Thai believe that his power would support career, Love and family. \nLast nights deadly terror attack and the bomb that exploded inside the holy Erawan shrine in Bangkok was composed of three kilograms of TNT stuffed in a pipe and wrapped with white cloth. Its destructive radius was estimated at 100 meters. This bomb last night killed 9 and injured 123, many taken to the Police General Hospital right across the street from the incident \nThe likelihood this terror attack was planned and implemented not by a Buddhist or Thai citizen is a reasonable assumption a this time.
