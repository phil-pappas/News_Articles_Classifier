The A350s and A330s are slated for Iberia’s fleet modernisation and to open new long-haul routes, and the A320neos will be allocated to the group’s airlines for fleet replacement. \nWith this latest order for 31 aircraft IAG and its airlines have ordered a total of nearly 450 aircraft from Airbus. IAG’s airlines British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, between them operate nearly every aircraft in Airbus’ product range from the smallest single aisle A318 to the world’s largest wide-body A380. \n“IAG’s additional order for A350s and A330s is very significant for us and highlights the appeal of our leading wide-body Family. It always fills us with great pride when one of our biggest and most influential customers recognises the superior operating economics and passenger experience of our aircraft”, said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “The repeat selection of the A320neo is also a great endorsement of the world’s preferred single aisle Family among the world’s most prestigious carriers.” \nThe A350 XWB is the world’s most modern and efficient aircraft family. Over 780 aircraft have been ordered and five delivered. Since entering into service in January 2015, the fleet of five A350 XWBs have demonstrated high operational reliability and passenger appeal. The A330 is one of the most popular and versatile widebody aircraft ever and has to date won over 1,500 orders, with over 1,200 delivered to some 110 operators worldwide. \nThe A330, the A350 XWB and A380 make up the Airbus widebody aircraft Family, which uniquely spans the 250 to over-500 seats segment.
