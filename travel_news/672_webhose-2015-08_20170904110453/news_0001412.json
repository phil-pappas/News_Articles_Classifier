In fact, you probably have everything you’ll need to play FootGolf right at home. FootGolf is attracting attention as an ideal activity for families to get out in the sunshine and play together, and it makes a great activity while on a family vacation. What is FootGolf, you ask? Take a soccer ball and strategically kick it around a beautiful 18 hole golf course into specially designed 21 inch cups cut into the rough of the course. Simple and fun! \nSince the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994, the popularity of soccer in America has skyrocketed. This year it reached new heights as evidenced by the huge TV audience tuning in to watch the US Women’s Soccer Team win the FIFA Women’s World Cup championship. It’s estimated that nearly 25 million men, women and children in America play soccer on some level. So it’s time to get to know the American FootGolf League (AFGL). \nThe AFGL website is the hub to find all the rules of play and locate a golf course near you. With over 600 courses already participating, finding a nearby course shouldn’t be a problem for most Americans. In fact, the popular Ka’anapali Golf Courses in Maui have recently introduced FootGolf for play after 3:00 in the afternoon. Instead of greens fees of over $100, FootGolf players pay just $15 to walk the course or an additional $15 for a shared cart. Bring your own Size 5 soccer ball or rent one for $5 per round. There are even courses in Las Vegas! \nThe rules of play are very similar to golf, as is the dress code. Most players opt to wear some brightly colored argyle knee socks, nickers or shorts, polo shirt and scally (news-boy, Gatsby, ivy) cap. It’s very important to note that NO soccer cleats of any kind are allowed – indoor, smooth bottom soccer shoes are the way to go. An 18 hole round of FootGolf usually takes about 2 1/2 hours to complete. \nFootGolf has also become a popular activity in Europe as well. FootGolf courses can be found in England, Ireland, The Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary and Norway to name a few. So get out there with your whole family and have some inexpensive fun in an beautiful outdoor environment. But just watch out….. your kids my just beat you!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T21:48:05.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
