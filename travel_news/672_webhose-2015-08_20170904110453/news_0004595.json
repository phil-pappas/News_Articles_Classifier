The University of Law (ULaw) today announced that students who don’t secure a job after nine months following graduation will be given half of their tuition fees back. Aimed at students enrolling on the Legal Practice Course this September, the move could see students refunded up to £7,000 if they fail to secure a training contract or full time position following graduation. The offer comes as other institutions announce 'sweeteners' as they compete for students in an increasingly competitive market. In January this year, the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) announced plans to introduce refunds to students who failed to complete their degrees despite full participation throughout the course. Professor Craig Mahoney, UWS principal, said at the time that publicly-funded universities should become more \"commercially sensitive\" and should treat students as \"customers\" in order to remain competitive across the globe. While it's unlikely that ULaw will be forced to refund many students, with a current employment rate that stands at 97 per cent, David Johnston, CEO of ULaw, said that \"today’s students want a clear return on their investment\". \"For law graduates, this means one thing: securing a training contract or a full time job upon graduation,\" he added. Mr Johnston said that industry links were crucial to employability and also added that it was vital that students were given \"the opportunity to put their skills into practice while still studying.\" The announcement comes as some 300,000 A-level students across England, Wales and Northern Ireland prepare to collect their results next week, with record numbers expected to enter higher education following the removal of the cap on student recruitment. According to figures released last month by the Higher Education and Statistics Agency (HESA), the percentage of graduates unemployed six months after graduating has fallen for the second year running; from 9 per cent in 2011/12, to 7 per cent in 2013/14. However, education professionals have suggested that more could be done to make sure employability is taken into account on degree courses. Speaking to the Telegraph recently, Professor Edward Peck, vice-chancellor at Nottingham Trent University, said: \"At a number of universities, graduate employment statistics are not as strong as perhaps we would like them to be. \"It strikes me that if we are saying to students that coming to university will improve your job prospects, then we have to deliver that.\" @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T20:49:22.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
