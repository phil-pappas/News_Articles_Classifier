Not even in New York.”\n“Yep, the city’s eating scene is having a great year. I’d say it’s time to pay it a visit,” Knowlton concluded.\nWhen asked about his decision, he said, “San Francisco (and its restaurants and chefs) did all the hard work. My job was easy…eating!”\nSan Francisco also has two restaurants on Bon Appétit’s Hot 10 list, which will be released on Aug.\n“We are very excited to have our city’s culinary excellence recognized by Bon Appétit,” said Joe D’Alessandro, president and CEO of the San Francisco Travel Association whose recent research showed that the most popular activities in which San Francisco visitors participated were dining in restaurants (77.4%), shopping (54.4%) and visiting a park (42.0%).\nSan Francisco’s ambiance, scenic beauty and restaurants continue to be the most important factors attracting visitors to the city. About one-third reported that San Francisco’s overall ambiance and atmosphere (38.7%), scenic beauty (34.3%) and/or restaurants and cuisine (28.0%) were the factors that were most important to their decision to visit the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:08:50.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
