Consider the Tarentaise Valley, where you can walk, sled or even fly to explore the area. \nThere’s nothing quite like a spontaneous getaway on last minute ski holidays. Whether you're trying to take advantage of the last of the year's snow, or hitting the slopes in the peak of the season, there's winter fun to be had - often at an amazingly good price! \nIn the Tarentaise Valley in France, there really is something for everyone on this type of break, even if not everyone in the group wants to ski. Last minute ski holidays can be excellent for families, even if younger children are along for the ride, because there are plenty of other activities available aside from skiing or snow boarding. The area includes access to the Three Valleys, Paradiski, La Plagne, Les Arcs, and Espace Killy - all of which have their own individual flavour - and if you want some activities outside the realm of skiing, this is the right place to go! \nWalking and hiking \nFor those who book last minute ski holidays but don’t want to spend all their time on skis, there are some absolutely fantastic walking and hiking trails in the Tarentaise Valley. Near Espace Killy, the walking trails are a great way to get up close and personal to the local nature and wildlife, while areas around La Plagne are great for snowshoeing. The specially designed snowshoes help make it easier to walk through deep snow by keeping your feet from sinking. In the heavier snow, such walking excursions aren't about getting the longest distances, they're more about getting out into nature and soaking up the sights, sounds and smells of the winter wonderland. But if you like the idea of going for longer walks to explore the landscape more fully, get yourself some good snowshoes and hire an experienced guide. With a guide, you can go off the beaten track and get to see things that you wouldn't be able to on the regular pistes around the village resorts. \nTobogganing, sledding and more \nIf you've spent most of your time on your last minute ski holidays skiing or snowboarding and you want to relax with something that's not quite so energetic, even the most experienced winter sportspeople can get some fun out of the simpler pursuits! \nAt Paradiski, you can take advantage of a host of non-skiing outdoor activities including sledding and tobogganing – and the children will absolutely love you for it. Tobogganing is guaranteed to have you smiling by the end of a day tackling the extensive runs here. It's also a great activity if you have younger members of the family who are not quite up to the challenge of skis yet. \nIf you like the idea of getting out in the great outdoors on the snow, but not on skis, book a sledding trip! You can spend a day learning how to drive the incredible teams of dogs, or you can have your own personal driver/guide, who'll take you out and introduce you to this wonderful activity while exploring the countryside. This is a fantastic activity for the entire family. \nBut if it's adventure you're looking for, why not try paragliding over the slopes? You can take a day and learn the basics in a local paragliding school, or you can go on a two-person paraglide with an experienced guide and see the slopes from a bird’s eye view without having to do any of the work - there’s really nothing quite like it. \nWinter sports aren't all about skiing and snowboarding – there is so much else to be discovered.
