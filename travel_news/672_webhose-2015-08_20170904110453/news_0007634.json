Sign In Here Each weekend, locals ride up and down the strip on bikes, pedicabs take tourists to restaurants and clubs, and pedestrian traffic bustles all day. The movement along this tourism corridor is smooth and the people seem happy. Unfortunately, we’re talking about South Beach in Miami — an example of walkability that Orlando’s major tourism corridor, International Drive, sadly lacks. “I went down to South Beach ... and thought, ‘OK, we are not so cool after all. This is really cool,’ ” said Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs . “So I came back and wondered how can we create something on that level. It would be neat if we could get I-Drive to be a place we all want to go.” The problem: I-Drive’s ability to move tourists along the corridor without setting foot in a car comes up short when compared to competing destinations, especially in the convention market. That matters because the convention center generates more than $2 billion in economic impact to the region each year for Central Florida’s $60 billion travel and tourism industry — the region’s No. 1 economic engine. And if fewer conventions come to town, that could hurt area hotels, restaurants, shops, car rentals, taxis and attractions, as well as their vendors and employees — sending ripples across the local economy. That’s why Orange County is developing what might be considered an audacious plan to counteract the fact that I-Drive’s walkability is the worst among 11 major U.S. convention districts when looking at factors such as amenities within a 5-mile walk, walking routes to nearby amenities, intersection density, block length and more. Orange County scored a 45 out of 100, while convention cities with integrated transit like rail and street cars such as San Francisco, Atlanta and San Diego all scored above or near 90 — a “walker’s paradise.” Even convention competitors like Las Vegas and Chicago scored 80 and 69, respectively. “The things I like when I travel, I come back and ask why don’t we have that?” said Jacobs. “I like to go places where I can leave my hotel and see what’s there, pop into local shops and it’s all walkable. But I don’t feel like that on I-Drive.” The pulse of I-Drive’s walkability She’s not alone. The geeks and nerds were everywhere when the Orange County Convention Center hosted GeekyCon in July. Fans of pop culture series like Harry Potter, Doctor Who , Star Trek and Star Wars flocked to I-Drive to mingle with fellow geeks. Judi Backof from Fort Pierce said this was her third visit to the convention, with plans to visit friends and do other activities on I-Drive, but she planned to drive to get there. “You have to be careful walking on I-Drive — not everyone driving stops at the crosswalks.” Many other attendees also said their only I-Drive walking experience would involve crossing over it on pedestrian bridges that connect their hotels to the convention center. To be sure, some event planners feel differently. Jonathan Perlman , event director for Zumba Fitness LLC, which hosted the Aug. 13-15 8,000-attendee Zumba Fitness Instructor Convention, praised Orlando’s convention district. “The walkability on I-Drive actually is really good. Our attendees have never had any issues, and they love the fact that there are large sidewalks with great retails outlets on either side of the street.” Kevin Brooks , public relations and conference manager for the Church of God, which hosts a 28,000-attendee event at the convention center each year, added: “There are three magic words you can use to describe the convention district in Orlando: affordability, accessibility and walkability. This is one of the most walkable convention districts in the nation.” Still, he added that more pedestrian bridges and crosswalks would be a good idea. “The future pedestrian bridge from the Hyatt Orlando to the convention center’s west wing will be a game-changer for us and many other walking groups or conventions.” Meanwhile, an annual study of the Orange County Convention Center’s event-planning clients showed that the importance of walkability will only grow. For example, things affected by walkability, such as proximity to nearby hotels, nightlife and restaurants, were most important to event planners, even topping gathering spaces and light rail that connects to airports. And as other major destinations improve their convention, hotel, restaurant and entertainment product, that could put more competitive pressure on Orlando’s convention center. ‘Get this done and get it done right’ Few people know I-Drive and its need for improved walkability better than Kathie Canning , executive director of the Orange County Convention Center. “We have lost business because of our walkability. Some groups insist on meeting in an urban destination, and we are not considered urban enough.” That’s because most event planners describe Orlando’s convention district as more horizontal than vertical, which has hurt its event recruiting efforts. Part of the problem is the corridor doesn’t lure anyone to walk it. “So the issue is: What will entice you to walk?” she said. “For example, to walk to my office, I’m going to walk through the Hilton Orlando, across the pedestrian bridge, through the convention center’s North/South Concourse because of the air-conditioning, through the Hyatt and then finally reach my office. The issue is: How do you make our destination walkable, interesting and easy to get to?” That’s a key question, said local developers. In fact, it will become harder to lure developers to invest in the region without a commitment to improve that walkability, said Chuck Whittall , president of Unicorp National Developments , which built the new I-Drive 360 and I-Shops entertainment and retail complexes on I-Drive. “This is vitally important because we will be competing with Disney and Universal for casual evening traffic and theme park-level rides. It’s important we get this done and get it done right.” I-Drive’s Skyplex and Mango’s Tropical Cafe developer Joshua Wallack hopes the county follows through on its vision as soon as possible. “We are talking about an entertainment district with a score of 45 out of 100 — that’s not just an F, it’s a low F. So how do you get that A? It’s going to take huge, bold steps where you have to throw the ball down the field because we’re several touchdowns behind.” That, said Jacobs, is the plan. Planned I-Drive improvements Just like it took Walt Disney and his team decades to convince people he could morph marshlands into what is now the world’s most-visited theme park, fixing I-Drive’s walkability won’t happen overnight. Nor will it be cheap. That’s why Jacobs and county planners have been researching how to improve the tourism corridor with better infrastructure and collaboration with conventions, entertainment districts and open-air venues to improve the visitor experience. For example, the county plans to: Develop 12 acres of county-owned land near the convention center and Hilton Orlando for a mixed-use tourist hub. This potentially may include 500 multifamily units that could be apartments or timeshare or vacation rentals, plus 130,000 square feet of retail space, 2,700 parking spaces and a 6,500-seat stadium — all attached to a rail station. Develop 28 acres of county-owned land just north of SeaWorld’s Aquatica park for another mixed-use development with 102,000 square feet of big-box retail space for tenants like Target, 179,900 square feet of smaller retail space, 177,300 square feet of office space, 300 residential units and 57,000 square feet of institutional space. Widen I-Drive for bike/pedicab lanes and better bus lanes. These would be used by locals and tourists. Build pedestrian bridges over the Sand Lake Road and I-Drive intersections that would connect the four corners containing I-Shops to the southeast, the future Skyplex project to the northeast, the new McDonald’s property to the northwest and Mango’s Tropical Cafe to the southwest. The bridges are expected to act as an iconic welcoming entrance to the I-Drive corridor. Identify main hubs and social areas along I-Drive that can be used to host regional events and potentially partner with visiting conventions as after-show meeting spots. This is more of a cultural improvement that could include outdoor theaters for I-Drive to showcase the unified mission of the business along the corridor to be the complete visitor experience. “All of those improvements are critical and are what will change that walkability score and the existing conditions,” said Alberto Vargas , the Orange County planning manager spearheading the county’s 25-year vision for I-Drive. He added that many of the improvements such as pedestrian bridges and roadway upgrades may happen sooner rather than later. “All the stars are lining up. The market is picking up and we have local property owners ready to invest.” The costs — likely hundreds of millions of dollars — and potential funding sources for many of the projects will be revealed later this year when Vargas’ team presents its plan to Orange County leaders for review and a vote. “The mayor tasked us with [finding out] how we can take I-Drive beyond auto-dependency.” Added Jacobs: “I see a place that has interesting entertainment, where there’s a lot going on outside and it’s lively. I see unique restaurants and shows, and a place where people can live and walk out the door and into a jazz bar with everything just right around the corner.” Photographer Jim Carchidi contributed to this story.
