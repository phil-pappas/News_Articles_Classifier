I went all over the world with heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, and other boxers, travelling everywhere including the US, China , Japan, Puerto Rico, South Africa , Ukraine and Georgia. But I’ve travelled less since August 2013, when it broke that I was transitioning to become a woman. Having three bouts of major surgery, and 300 facial electrolysis sessions, has been quite a process. But I’m raring to travel again. As Kellie, I’ve seen Berlin and New York , and Malta , where I attended a wedding, my first as Kellie – I bought a lovely new dress for it. I have a house in Portugal and I’m usually there several times a year. A few weeks ago I went back there for the first time in 12 months and my neighbour met me as Kellie for the first time. She was very friendly and nice about it. She knew all about my transition from the recent documentary about it and from seeing me on Celebrity Big Brother. \nWhat do you need for a perfect holiday? \nPeace and quiet, and places to visit if I get bored. I love old buildings, churches, museums and street markets. I’ve bought paintings from flea markets in Portugal; hand-carved silver boxes in Thailand; wooden masks from Africa; and figurines from South America. I love snuffling out a bargain. \nThe Algarve coast Photo: Fotolia/AP \nYour most relaxing destination? \nMy house in the Algarve hills, between Loulé and Faro. I’ve had it for 15 years. It’s my home from home. I go whenever I can and so do my daughters, Emma, Sophie and Libby. If I drive, I take my Airedale terriers Louie and Minnie – they’ve got their own pet passports. I love getting on the ferry at Portsmouth and sailing across the Bay of Biscay for a day, isolated from the world. During my transition, that house was my haven. Whenever I arrive in Portugal, the stress drops off me. My balcony has the best view in the Algarve. I sit there with a bottle of wine, watching the sun disappear and the stars come out. It’s fantastic. \nThe most remote place you’ve been? \nA resort area known as Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains of California. We were at a training camp for Lennox. It has a massive lake surrounded by a forest and is set nearly 7,000ft above sea level. It felt even more isolated as we were there out of season – it’s mainly a resort for snow sports. After work I used to go back to my apartment and sit in the Jacuzzi drinking hot chocolate, not champagne as people might expect. I loved the solitude; I’m very content on my own. Having said that, I was in Vilamoura in Portugal recently and a group of Essex girls asked me to join them – I was out partying with them until 4am. I can still drink but it takes me a lot longer to recover. I didn’t come down from the hills for two days after that. \nWorst travel experience? \nChina. I was in the north of the country for a boxing match and was supposed to be there for 10 days, but I stayed for only three because I hated it so much. I found the culture so strange. I looked at what I believed were pet dogs in cages and when I asked about them, someone told me that they thought I wanted to buy that dog to eat it. That was horrifying for me as a dog lover. But I did enjoy going to the panda reserve and seeing baby pandas – they are so cute. \nThe San Bernardino National Forest in California Photo: Fotolia/AP \nMost fascinating place you’ve visited? \nTokyo . Japan is one of the humblest yet proudest nations I’ve come across. They would bow and I would bow back and they would bow lower. It was a mark of respect to visitors. We went to watch boxers training at a gym, and as soon as a bit of sweat hit the floor, someone cleaned it up – unheard of in an English gym. From 7am to 7pm the city is a hive of industry, but after sundown they become wild party animals. And I loved all the old Japanese temples, because I like Buddhism. \n• Weird things about Japan \nFavourite hotel? \nCaesars Palace in Las Vegas . It’s like an adult’s Disney World. Las Vegas is on my wish list to return to as Kellie. People are nicer and more polite since I’ve transitioned. Maybe I’m nicer as a woman. I certainly enjoy life a lot more than I did as Frank. \n• Las Vegas: the best of Sin City, from gritty to glitzy \nFavourite city? \nRome , as I love visiting the Vatican. I’m not religious but there’s something about it that I find very spiritual. I found Perth beautiful. My brother Vince lives there and I bought a house on the seafront there with my second wife, Tracey, in 2000. From the balcony you could watch the whales swimming in the ocean. It seemed like a great place to live but we never moved there in the end. \nA boxing match in Tokyo, Japan Photo: Getty Images \nFavourite airline? \nI like Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, and Brunei Airlines. I found the Brunei people very humble and I loved the rainforest, where the orang-utans live. \nBest piece of travel advice? \nGet to the airport early, because the queues are awful. You’d never believe how many planes I’ve missed running late. I had to learn that planes wait for no one, not even the Queen. Avoid flying, if you can, to save yourself the stress. \nWhere next? \nI’d like to visit Barcelona and Israel. I’m doing a sponsored trek in Burma in the autumn for a women’s charity and I’ve also promised to take my 82-year-old mum on a cruise, something I have never done. I’m going to Tobago with my daughter Libby during half-term. I’d love to travel more in England too, such as to the Lake District and Co Durham. I also have a soft spot for Glasgow and Cardiff. We don’t always appreciate what’s right on our own doorstep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:48:32.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
