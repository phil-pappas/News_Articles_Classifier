Ranked among the top five courses in New York by GOLF Magazine and Golfweek, Men’s Journal dubbed the course “a modern masterpiece.” Surrounded by a sea of traditional, private clubs, Pound Ridge stands out as a testament to Dye’s progressive design techniques and owner Ken Wang’s commitment to daily fee golf.
