A video of the Guest Service Tool in action is available here.“Our flight attendants, as with all Delta employees, are committed to making the flying experience better for our customers while endeavoring to bring more humanity to the skies,” said Allison Ausband, Delta´s Senior Vice President of In-Flight Service. “Having technology at their fingertips to identify and greet customers by name, highlight customers´ Medallion status, address disruptions in their travel in real-time as well as a host of other opportunities means the world´s finest flight attendants can provide an even more exceptional customer experience.”With the Guest Service Tool, flight attendants will have a better sense of the customers traveling on board, be able to recognize high-value customers and better serve those on board who may need extra assistance or attention. As the tool evolves, they´ll also be able to proactively provide customers with the status of down-line flights and connecting gate information.The move to advance technology in the cabin comes on the heels of Delta´s industry-leading initiative to equip its nearly 12,000 pilots with innovative Microsoft Surface Tablets to be used as an electronic flight bag as well as enterprise connectivity tool to improve efficiency and reduce pilot workload.
