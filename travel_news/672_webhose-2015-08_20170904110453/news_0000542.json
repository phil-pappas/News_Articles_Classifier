It looks amazing and gets a lot of attention on the Newton & Pott market stall. You could actually use this method with most recipes that have a medium set as they will happily sit on top of each other without mixing together. When serving, use a long-handled spoon to get the jams out of the jar, to make sure you get the best of both flavours. For tips and tricks on how to make the perfect preserves, read Chutneys, jams and pickled vegetables: a beginner's guide MAKES 6-8 x 228ml jars INGREDIENTS For the peach jam: 1kg peaches 500g jam sugar 40ml lemon juice (about ½ lemon) For the blackberry jam: 1.6kg blackberries 1kg jam sugar 30ml lemon juice (about ½ lemon) METHOD The peaches need peeling for this recipe. Do this by cutting a cross on their base, blanching them in boiling water for a couple of minutes, then dunking them in ice-cold water. The skins will peel off easily. Make sure that you start the peach jam first as it takes longer, and, while it’s cooking, prepare the blackberry jam. That way the jars won’t cool too much before you pour in the second jam. Peel, stone and dice the peaches. Combine all the peach jam ingredients in a large jam pan and boil, stirring often, for 30-40 minutes. Use the wrinkle test (see the pear and lavender jam recipe) to check the setting point, then, when ready, take off the heat and skim off any scum from the surface. Meanwhile, place the blackberries in a separate large jam pan with 200ml water and the lemon juice, and slowly soften on a moderate heat for about 10 minutes. Add the jam sugar, stir to dissolve then bring to the boil for 15-20 minutes, stirring intermittently. Use the wrinkle test to check the setting point then, when ready, take off the heat and skim off any scum from the surface. Mark a halfway line on the warm, dry sterilised jars and pour in the blackberry jam to this line. Let it sit for five minutes while it forms a seal and you finish the other jam. Once the peach jam is ready, pour it on top of the blackberry jam to fill the jars almost to the rim, and seal. Keeps unopened for up to six months. Once opened, refrigerate and eat within 4-6 weeks.
