A key element in securing this overseas investment was the vision of UKFE for this unique concept.\nThe support from UKFE specialists to provide the opportunity to develop face to face business relationships with exhibitors was an integral part of Eikon Exhibition Centre coming on board.\nAs Theresa Morrissey, Commercial and Financial Director for Eikon Exhibition Centre explains; “The passion from UKFE to develop this scheme shows the forward thinking elements in place to grow the Venue Expo to European and International proportions. The location in Liverpool is fantastic and we feel that buyers will have a unique and fulfilling experience visiting the city. We are also delighted to be attending one of the first events at the new Liverpool Exhibition Centre in such a capacity, just a few weeks before we open the doors to our own multi-million pound exhibition and events venue in Ireland.\nWe have created a buzz back on the island of Ireland as Eikon will be the largest bespoke venue in the country. Our team from the King’s Hall Complex will be relocating to form the backbone of our venue, providing a world-class service to event organisers.\nSponsoring at the Venue Expo has given us a dynamic opportunity not only to showcase our innovative team to event organisers but to provide a personal connection to exhibitors and hosted buyers at the Expo from all over the U.K and abroad. We feel this will be a fulfilling experience and already hope to attend the Expo in 2016 as event sponsors and exhibitors.”\nThe night before an event is always a vibe of activity and anticipation. Exhibitors scramble to complete stands, venue managers and operations teams work to the small hours detailing the final touches. However, the night before the Venue Expo will have a different vibe as Hilton Liverpool will host the inaugural “Exhibitors & Hosted Buyers Drinks Reception”, again sponsored by Eikon Exhibition Centre.\nTheresa continues; “Providing such a great platform, enabling hosted buyers and exhibitors the opportunity to meet at close quarters the night before the Expo begins is a real highlight. Our team from Eikon will be present and look forward to meeting these representatives from different event professions from around the country.”\nBringing Eikon Exhibition Centre on board is testament to The Venue Expo’s broader reach this year. The event has secured exhibitors from all around the UK and abroad including Wembley Stadium – the UK’s largest sporting stadium, ticketea – Spain’s leading ticketing platform and Zephyr Solutions – an event supplier from the United States.\nSource:-HBAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:49:35.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
