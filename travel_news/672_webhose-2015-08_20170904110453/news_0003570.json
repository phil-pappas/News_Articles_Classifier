They were celebrating the lives of a mother and her daughters who were killed Friday.\nFor nearly 30 years Joy Remfrew dated Rhonda and Regina Herring's father and considered the women to be family.\n\"I have regarded Rhonda and Regina as my children they brought me Mother's Day flowers and Mother's Day cards on Mother's Day,\" said Remfrew.\nWhen she learned the sisters and their mom Julie Ann Falzarano were murdered Friday she was in shock.\n\"I didn't believe it, it was beyond believe it was beyond belief,\" said Remfrew.\nThat shock has turned to profound sadness and led hundreds to the scene where they were killed for a community vigil Thursday night.\n\"This is something that really shook our community and it's important that we are all just pulling together to be there for the family,\" said Victoria England.\n\"There are all kinds of networks and layers of relationships in small communities and it is just important for folks to pay attention to those relationships and to just take life one step at a time one breath at a time right now,\" said Pastor Carl Hilton Van Osdell.\nHilton Van Osdell is with the First Presbyterian Church in Barre. He led the crowd of family, friends and loved ones in reflection and prayer for the three women.\nHe says in a week when the region has seen so much tragedy including the murder of Department of Children and Families social worker Lara Sobel, often the best things people can do is lend a friendly ear.\n\"I think especially in a time of grief and hardship I'm not sure there are perfect words to say but just having a listening ear makes all the difference in the world,\" said Hilton Van Osdell.\nA difference that was on display in the fields of a little white farm house once filled with the love of a mother and her daughters now packed with the memories of those they leave behind. People like Remfrew who hope love will help all who are hurting heal their broken hearts.\n\"I have no idea I just hope and pray that everything works out fine that the family can kind of simmer down and come to grips with it,\" said Remfrew.\nThe victims' family member Jody Herring is already charged with murdering Lara Sobel and authorities believe she is connected to Rhonda, Regina and Julie Ann's case as well. The investigation into their deaths is slated to wrap up by the end of the week.\nRelated Stories:\nHerring family breaks silence about slain loved ones\nSobel funeral held; Vt. officials discuss new security measures\nHerring family: Avoid social media fundraising sites\nMass. social workers hold vigil in honor of Vt. colleague\nBarre woman pleads not guilty to killing state employee\nSlow healing for communities hit by violence\nState flags ordered at half-staff\nFriends, family hold vigil for slain social worker\nShumlin: Vermonters Shocked, horrified, grief stricken\nHerring officially charged in deadly Barre shooting\n3 women found dead in Berlin related to Barre shooting suspect\nVt. leaders react to Barre murder, Berlin deaths\nSurveillance video may show deadly Barre shooting\nVt.
