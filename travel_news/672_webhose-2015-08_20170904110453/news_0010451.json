Josh and Steve are both experienced entrepreneurs and mentoring experts that have helped hundreds of businesses develop and grow.\nThe winners will have their undivided attention for the duration of the ten hour flight to discuss and solve a business challenge they’re facing.\nThe flight comes as the airline releases research conducted with 175 of its top customers in to the value of mentoring.\nThe top findings revealed:\n• 97 per cent said mentoring added real value and 82 per cent agreed it helped boost their business.\n• 53 per cent of men said they were a mentor, compared to 39 per cent of women\n• 20 per cent of women will organise mentoring for themselves versus just eight per cent of men\n• 84 per cent of women want mentoring for career development and improving performance at work versus 71 per cent of men\n• Eight per cent more men than women want mentoring to help them run a business and four per cent more want it to help them build relationships\n• 83 per cent conducted their mentoring face-to-face\n• The top names that people wanted to be mentored by included Barak Obama, Warren Buffet, Alex Ferguson, Joanna Lumley, Tim Cook and the Dalai Lama\nBusiness owners interested in making the most of this mentoring opportunity can go to www.ba.com/flywithleaders to submit a pitch to explain why working with the Capital Factory would help transform their company.\nAndrew Crawley, British Airways’ chief commercial officer, said: “British Airways’ On Business loyalty programme benefits both the company and the individual, by enabling the business to save money on flights and the flyer to collect Avios and tier points.\n“The British Airways’ Mentoring Flight will give a lucky group of specially selected SMEs the once in a lifetime opportunity to receive brilliant business support through two amazing mentors from one of the world’s best business incubators, the Capital Factory.\n“Based in one of the fastest growing cities in the US, with an unrivalled reputation for helping businesses start up and grow, there’s no better placed organization to mentor SMEs than the Capital Factory.“\nJoshua Baer, the founder and executive director of Capital Factory, said: “I’m really looking forward to meeting the winners of British Airways’ competition on the flight. Mentoring at 35,000ft will be a new experience for me, but all that dedicated quiet time on the flight will definitely deliver results.\n“There has never been a better time to connect the number one start-up city in the U.S. with the number one start-up city in Europe and since British Airways established a direct flight between Austin and London we are seeing more Austin companies doing business across the pond and vice-versa.\n“Meeting face-to-face is a really important part of that but budgets are tight for start-ups, so making your finances go further and work harder by joining schemes like On Business makes perfect sense.”\nOn Business has saved firms £34m on travelling to do business face-to-face, and the re-vamped programme will now enable travellers to choose between an immediate discount of at least five per cent off on selected flights, or On Business points that can be used towards future trips and upgrades.\nOn Business members can enjoy:\n• The flexibility to choose between earning points on flights or having a cash discount\n• More flights to collect and redeem on, by flying on British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia. There will also be more reward flights available. Customers who are members of the British Airways Executive Club and Iberia Plus can also earn Avios from their flights\n• A new three-tiered programme, with each tier related to the amount spent on flights in a year, rather than distance travelled. The higher the tier, the greater the points towards reward flights.\n• A simplified earn and spend, so customers can now earn on the money they spend on each flight rather than the number of sectors flown.\n• Discounts on ba.com/ib.com/aa.com, with exclusive news and member-only offers to boost points and savings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:54:38.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
