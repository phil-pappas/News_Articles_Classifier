A Denver airline passenger ran out to the ramp area of an airport in an effort to stop the plane of the flight he had just missed. The passenger was trying to get to his 40-year high school reunion.\nAccording to media reports, the incident occurred on Aug 6 but wasn’t disclosed until Wednesday.\nIn a probable cause affidavit, police explained that the man ‘did then run out of the door into a sterile area of the airport and chased down on foot, a tug and tug driver who was actively engaged in pushing back … (an) aircraft filled with passengers.’\nThe man was late for the flight, which he was taking to Ohio for his reunion.\nThe incident, however, didn’t affect airfield operations nor did it significant delay the United Airlines flight.\nCharges have been filed against the man for endangering public transportation and hindering public transportation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:03:58.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
