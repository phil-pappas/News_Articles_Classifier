Add a few thousand semi-precious stones, carved and inlaid in intricate Islamic patterns. Take a sublime setting by a sacred river, in jewel-like formal gardens. Apply a little perfect symmetry, and tie up the whole package in an outlandish story of timeless love. And there you have the Taj Mahal”.\nIt notes that there’s no other building in India that so perfectly encapsulates the attitudes and atmosphere of its era.\nThe Temples of Angkor, a UNESCO World Heritage site in northern Cambodia, tops the list as a complex of more than 1,000 temples, shrines and tombs which attracts more than 2 million visitors annually.\nThe Great Barrier Reef in Australia comes in at number two, the Inca city of Machu Picchu in Peru at number three, and the Great Wall of China at four.\nTravel writers and Lonely Planet staff were invited to submit ideas before voting on their favourites.\nVoters were asked to consider which sights enthused, inspired, and excited them the most.\nThe one UK entry was the British Museum, which came in 15th on the wish list.\nTo celebrate the release of the new book, some of the world’s finest sand sculptors will recreate five sights from around the world on Peter’s Hill near St. Paul’s Cathedral in central London later this week.\n 18, 2015 9:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T15:31:14.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
