Rather than buying grotty burgers at festivals, they’re getting these amazing brown rice bowls and Asian dumplings. It’s completely different.\" They might be a little more discerning than their predecessors , but there’s still a gulf between what your average teenager likes to eat (tasty, varied, interesting meals) and what they can actually make (toast). The solution? Step forward a new breed of unstuffy cookery courses , aimed at sixth-formers and school leavers. In 2013, Schneideman and her team launched Leiths’ one-week summer Cookery Bootcamp – a fun, fast-paced introduction to cooking that’s been a runaway success. The syllabus features plenty of easy student crowd-pleasers, from a Sunday roast (complete with gravy, potatoes and a crumble), to a lamb wrap with harissa and tzatziki. And on the last day, all the students take part in an “invention test”, where everyone creates a meal from scratch out of mystery ingredients – just like on MasterChef. “We wanted it to speak to the way young people eat,” Schneideman explains. But it isn’t just culinary skills being transferred at Leiths – attendees are also encouraged to think about budgeting, and they learn how to make their weekly shop stretch further. “We show them how to joint a chicken, for example, because it’s actually much cheaper to buy a whole one and cut it up than it is to buy chicken pieces,” Schneideman says. “It’s part of the transition into adulthood.\" Teenagers who have been on a course will see an immediate benefit in terms of money saved by not wasting food – and it could also help them become more financially independent in the long term.

They don’t have to commit to a ski season at the end of it – with a portfolio of quality dishes under their belt , they’ll be able to make money doing freezer-filling for family during the holidays, or try party catering. Another valuable skill a cooking course teaches is food hygiene. “Learning about storing different foods properly and how long it’s safe to keep them for is important. Things like that can slip through the net for young people,” says Emma Wray, manager of Bettys Cookery School in Harrogate, Yorkshire. She runs daylong “One Pot Wonders” courses over the summer, showing young people how to make hearty, good-value meals. Even a couple of hours’ tuition can be a great investment, Wray believes. “There’s the confidence you gain when you do something new, as well as the discipline that comes from having to follow a recipe,” she says. “And we get a lot of mothers booking themselves in with their children before they go off to university, as a sort of goodbye thing.” So get your soon-to-be-Fresher a place this summer and set them up well. The only thing it won’t teach them is how to wash up.
