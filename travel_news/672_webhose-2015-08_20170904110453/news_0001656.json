Brendon Cousino died at the scene. The driver of the other car, Karri Benoir, is still recovering after being thrown from her car. Benoir's lawyer and father represented her in court Thursday. She is still in rehab, but listened to court proceedings by phone.\n\"Can't even stand up by herself barely. She has a broken leg, broken wrist and she's so bruised inside if you touch her she screams in pain,\" said Bruce Benoir, Karri's father.\nKarri Benoir is charged with second-degree murder. Police say she intentionally she crossed the median on Interstate 89 in Richmond, hitting Cousino head-on. She pleaded not guilty Monday.\nBenoir's lawyer wanted her released into the custody of her parents. But prosecutors argued the 23-year-old is a danger to herself and the public. They asked the court to hold her without bail once she's released from UVM's Fanny Allen campus in Colchester.\n\"Demonstrated a willingness to put innocent people at risk and acting out on her suicidal impulse and ideation,\" Chittenden County Deputy State's Attorney Bram Kranichfeld said.\nBenoir's lawyer, Robert Sussman, said she was not attempting suicide when the crash happened.\n\"There was a car accident, we're not in a position to dispute there was a car accident with tragic results, and no one's disputing there were tragic results,\" Sussman said. \"What it really boils down to is was this person trying to kill herself in the process or was she not?\"\nBail was set for Benoir at $100,000. She's expected to be released from Fanny Allen Thursday night. If she can't post bail, she's headed from the hospital to jail. She's due back in court next week.\nRelated Stories:\nBenoir arraigned on murder charges in deadly crash\nWoman accused in deadly crash to be arraigned Monday\nArraignment postponed for woman accused in deadly crash\nBarre woman to face murder charges in deadly crash\nCrash claims life of Richmond first responder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T07:27:45.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
