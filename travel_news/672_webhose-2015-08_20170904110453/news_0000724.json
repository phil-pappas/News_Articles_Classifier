The company is valued at more than $50 billion , The Wall Street Journal reported on July 31. \nThe company’s website asks driver applicants in Costa Rica to provide their national identification card, driver’s license, authorization for a background check, vehicle circulation permit (marchamo), proof of car insurance, a photo of the vehicle with the license plates visible and the vehicle’s technical revision, Riteve. \nUber appears ready to roll. But the government has told the company to hit the breaks. \nVice Minister of Transport Sebastián Urbina told La Nación that any cars operating with Uber would be considered “ pirates ” and could face fines of ₡99,000 (roughly $185) and lose their plates. Urbina said that any vehicle offering transportation services must be registered with the Public Transportation Council. \nTaxi drivers in Costa Rica have already mounted small demonstrations in solidarity with taxi unions in Colombia and Mexico that are fighting the Uber phenomenon. On July 30, taxis presented a letter to the Colombian Embassy in San José expressing their support for drivers protesting Uber in Cali, Medellín and Bogotá, the capital. \nUber already has operations in Mexico City and in Panama, Colombia and Chile, among other Latin American countries. \nUber’s pending arrival in Costa Rica comes at a time when there could suddenly be a lot of chauffeurs looking for work. In July, disputes between the government and private drivers known as “porteadores” flared when the latter were told that only half their concessions would be renewed . Drivers blocked streets around the country in protest. \nThe Solís administration offered an olive branch to the 1,500 drivers who would not get their concessions renewed. On Wednesday, Casa Presidencial said it would present a bill in the coming days that would grant these drivers permission to operate as taxis. Any drivers who can’t meet the requirements would be offered job training to become a public bus driver and access to social welfare programs. \nCosta Rica already has services like Tico Taxi and Easy Taxi allow users to call red cabs from their smartphones with GPS coordinates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T04:45:34.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
