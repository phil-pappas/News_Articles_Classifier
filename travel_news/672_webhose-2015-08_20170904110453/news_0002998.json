Moore said at one point the fire was within 75 yards of a home. There were no reported injuries, he said.\nThe fire was caused by a pile of rags being used to stain wood furniture, left in a backyard under the hot sun. Moore said these kind of staining rags “can spontaneously combust, which they did.” He said sunlight can speed up the reaction.\nMost Read Stories Black Lives Matter protesters shut down Bernie Sanders; later rally draws 15,000 60 years ago: The famous Boeing 707 prototype barrel roll over Lake Washington Seahawks' 53-man roster projection, post-scrimmage edition Seahawks rewarded for sticking to their salary-cap plan Condition of boy hurt in fall at Taylor Swift concert improves Moore said the fire got close to the home but “ended up burning upwards” toward a hill rather than “backwards toward the house.”\nThe fire burned about 2 acres, he said.\nJennifer Sullivan: 206-464-8294 or jensullivan@seattletimes.com .
