Andrew Cuomo says women posing nearly naked for photos in Times Square are breaking the law and undermining efforts to keep the tourist area family friendly. Cuomo said Wednesday on NY1 that the situation is beginning to remind him of the seedy days of the \"bad old Times Square.\" The women pose for photos with tourists in exchange for cash and often wear only body paint and a thong. Cuomo says the activity is interfering with \"legitimate\" businesses. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that he believes the practice is \"wrong\" and that the city will take action. The governor says he also has concerns about performers dressed as cartoon characters who harass tourists into purchasing photos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:18:37.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
