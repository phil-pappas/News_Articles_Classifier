The seat design — genius or a recipe for mile-high fury? Source: Supplied \nA NEW airline seat design aims to take some of the pain out of flying by offering adjustable leg room. \nDetailed in a patent application by B/A Aerospace, the seats would accommodate the different heights of passengers by rolling backwards and forwards on the tracks that already exist on the aircraft’s floor. \nThis would mean, in theory, that taller passengers who need more leg room could be given greater space at the expense of those passengers shorter than them. \nYOUR SAY: Is this a great idea? Tell us below. \nAfter passengers have checked in, and provided their height information, the flight crew would use an app that controls the movement of the seats’ gears and adjust the seats accordingly. \n“Even a relatively small incremental increase in seat spacing for the tall passengers can provide additional comfort with no loss of comfort to the much smaller passengers seated in front of the tall passengers,” the designers said in their patent application. The seats could be moved using an app. Source: Supplied \n“While passengers come in many sizes, children, adolescents, adults, men, women and with large height differentials within these categories, seat spacing in the main cabin of a passenger aircraft is generally uniform except at exit rows. \n“The one-size-fits-all seating arrangement can cause discomfort for tall passengers, while a child or relatively small adult may be seated in an identical seat at the seat pitch, with more than ample leg room and in relative comfort.” \nThere are concerns, however, that shorter passengers won’t like having to sacrifice their leg room.
