(Nasdaq:JOUT), a leading global outdoor recreation equipment company, reported increased sales and profits in the Company's 2015 fiscal third quarter ended July 3, 2015 resulting in a favorable sales comparison in the year-to-date fiscal nine-month period. \"A solid new product line-up is fueling positive marketplace momentum as we head into the final months of the warm-weather outdoor recreational season. The revolutionary Ulterra ™ fishing motor and the Talon ® 12' shallow water anchor are powering growth for Minn Kota ® , our $100+ million flagship fishing brand. In Watercraft, the Old Town ® Predator ™ series is also enhancing our position in the all-important outdoor specialty channel. And, the new MiniMo ™ from Jetboil ® , the leader in outdoor cooking systems, has ignited growth in our consumer camping portfolio. Work is underway to strengthen new product development and competitiveness in Diving where weak economies in European markets have impacted results,\" said Helen Johnson-Leipold, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. T HIRD Q UARTER R ESULTS Fiscal third quarter results historically reflect in-season replenishment orders for the Company's warm-weather outdoor recreation products. Total Company net sales were $140.9 million during the quarter, a 3 percent gain versus net sales of $137.1 million in the prior year third quarter. Foreign currency translation had a 3 percent unfavorable impact on sales versus the prior year quarter. Key factors behind the year-over-year comparison in each business unit were: Strong growth in Minn Kota ® , powered by exceptional new product response, drove an 8 percent increase in Marine Electronics revenue and a record-high $86.2 million in third quarter sales. Significantly higher Eureka! ® and Jetboil ® consumer camping sales could not offset declines in commercial and military segments resulting in a 1 percent dip in Outdoor Gear revenue. Watercraft revenue held steady with the prior year quarter as Old Town ® continued to gain share in the key fishing kayak segment. Unfavorable currency translation had an 11 percent unfavorable impact on Diving sales accounting for the 9 percent drop in revenue for the quarter. Total Company operating profit during the quarter was $16.4 million compared to $9.3 million in the prior fiscal year third quarter. Non-cash impairment charges of $8.5 million in Outdoor Gear and a $1.6 million cash recovery from the Jetboil ® indemnity escrow in the previous year quarter, partially offset by $1.4 million of legal expense in the current year quarter related to litigation brought by the Company asserting infringement of its patented side scan sonar technology by Garmin, were primary factors in the favorable year-over-year comparison. Excluding the net effect of these one-time items in both years, operating profit would have been $1.6 million ahead of the prior year. Third quarter net income was $10.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the previous third quarter. Y EAR - TO -D ATE R ESULTS Strong marketplace momentum around new products across the Company's consumer fishing, camping and water recreation brands during the fiscal third quarter brought year-to-date sales for the nine-month period 1 percent ahead of the same prior year period. Unfavorable currency translation had a 2 percent unfavorable impact on year-to-date revenue. Total Company operating profit was $16.7 million versus operating profit of $18.0 million in the same nine-month period last year. The net charges of $6.9 million taken in the prior year were almost entirely offset by patent litigation expense of $6.8 million taken in the current year. The remaining decrease in profit was driven by various factors including higher warranty costs and increased promotional spending. Net income was $9.4 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the current nine-month period compared to $9.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, in the same period last year. The Company's effective tax rate during the nine-month period was 40.9 percent versus 46.1 percent for the previous year-to-date period. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:44:33.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
