The unbearable stench and the terrible conditions in the coastline are forcing tourists to cancel their trips to the Caribbean.\nThe area is covered with algae provoking the foul stench along with biting sand fleas which cause itchy red soars. All these reasons are preventing tourists from coming to the Caribbeans.This situation has greatly affected the Caribbean coastline dropping tourist arrivals.\nThe origin of the sea weeds is being attributed to the rising ocean temperatures and changing currents all factors of climate change. Fertilizers and sewage wastes may also be responsible for the growth of the algae.\nThe foul odor from the rotten plants can also affect the marine life creating coastal dead zones with low oxygen and this might prove to be very harmful for the marine life.\nAlso the machinery that will be used to clean the shoreline will damage its natural beauty.\nHowever some tourists are still braving the foul odor to enjoy the sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:18:28.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
