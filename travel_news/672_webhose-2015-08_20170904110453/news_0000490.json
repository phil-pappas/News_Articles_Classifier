The hotel, which has been operating for 10 years, houses 18 of the suites in the same area, like a miniature housing development within the property. And there's so much to love about each unit. \nThe first door opens to an outdoor area, where your eyes are drawn to a glistening private swimming pool with trickling waterfalls. It's deep and large enough for a short swim or skinny-dipping beneath the stars. You two can be lovey-dovey while in the pool without worrying about prying eyes, thanks to the surrounding privacy wall. \nThe second door opens to a 52mÂ² indoor area, with a bedroom in the front and en suite bathroom in the back. The contemporary bedroom is spacious and inviting, with soft colours of wood. You two can watch satellite TV while touching toes in bed. Or feed one another fresh fruit on a daybed that looks out on the swimming pool. The sexy bathroom behind a sliding door features a bathtub large enough for two, and offers a view of a small garden on both sides. Suffice to say, lovers should easily get in the mood to make memories (and whoopee) during their stay. \nMore options for couples activities within the property include treatments for two in private rooms at the Bandara Spa, catching an outdoor movie on the hotel's lawn, dinner at Chom Dao restaurant or planting a love tree together. \nIf you don't mind sand between your toes, take a stroll on the beach from the hotel to community mall The Wharf and Fisherman's Village walking street. The latter is very impressive in terms of atmosphere, with a variety of places to shop and eat. Drink a B60-70 mojito from a stall, enjoy a wide range of street food on the go or sit down for a proper dinner at seaside restaurants. At the time of this writing, the walking street takes place on Fridays only, so time your visit accordingly. \nBandara also offers a free shuttle service to Chaweng. Sadly, the last free bus leaves Chaweng for the hotel at 5:30pm. Should you want to explore the town's nightlife, you'll have to find your own transport or arrange a bus ride with the hotel in advance (B1,000 for up to 10 passengers). \nBesides Pool Villa Suites, Bandara offers four additional room types, suiting different budgets and needs. There are also stay-sweetening promotions. The Grand Villa Sales promotion, which includes one night in Pool Villa Suite with breakfast and Wi-Fi, costs 8,626++ per night (or 7,548++ per night for a four-night stay). It's available for booking online until the end of Aug, for stays until the end of Aug. If you're planning a honeymoon, definitely consider it. \n- Bandara Resort & Spa, 178/2 Moo 1, Bophut, Koh Samui, Surat Thani.
