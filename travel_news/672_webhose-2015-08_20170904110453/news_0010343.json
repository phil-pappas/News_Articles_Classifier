Reunion Island will exhibit alongside fellow Indian Ocean Vanilla Island members which are also expected to make a strong showing in Paris. \nA 250-square-meter large stand will no doubt attract large numbers of trade visitors, and while still most tourists come from mainland France, other source markets have made gains, giving Reunion Island a more diverse client base. \nThis year, the island will revel in the spotlight after the Piton de la Fournaise, Reunion Island’s active volcano, has already erupted four times in spectacular lava flows. The island was also in the news for weeks on end when debris from missing flight MH370 was washed ashore on the Eastern beaches of the island. Whale and dolphin watching, a popular activity, will be promoted, as will hikes and biking trips into the UNESCO World Heritage site that is spread across the rugged interior of the island. Adventure activities also include abseiling, canyoning, white water rafting, and paragliding, among many other options for an active vacation. \nRunning from September 29 until October 2 at the Exhibition Centre of the Port de Versailles in Paris, Reunion Island’s participants will cover all segments of the island’s tourism industry, from resorts, hotels, and B&Bs, to car hire companies, DMCs (incoming agencies), and other attractions including helicopter companies and boat/yacht operators.
