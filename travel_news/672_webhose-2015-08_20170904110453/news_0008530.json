Event delegates have also been informed of the organiser’s decision which was made with the view that the Royal Thai government will soon restore Bangkok to normalcy. TTG has assured delegates that their safety and security will remain as the top priority, and further updates will be made in response to the situation. \n\nSaid Darren Ng, managing director of TTG Asia Media: “Thailand has been a tremendous host to IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific for over a decade, with Bangkok being home to the event for the 9th consecutive year now. Our delegates look forward to coming to this city year after to year as it remains an extremely popular destination for both business and leisure. \n\n“Our team is saddened and grieved by this incident that has rocked this hospitable city and its people. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, families and loved ones affected.
