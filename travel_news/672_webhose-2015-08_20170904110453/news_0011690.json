Under the agreement Worldwide Laundry will sell and service Xeros' award-winning polymer bead cleaning laundry systems which are proven to dramatically reduce water, energy and detergent consumption. See today's related announcement: Xeros Now Offers Near-Waterless Laundry to Canadian Hotel, Commercial Laundry and Dry Cleaning Markets \nWorldwide Laundry, Inc. is a full service laundry equipment, parts and supplies company with forty years of combined experience in the distribution of on-premise, coin laundry, dry-cleaning equipment at competitive prices worldwide. Worldwide Laundry will be facilitating delivery of the Xeros solution to the broader Caribbean and Latin American markets. \nAlthough Latin America is reported to have the most annual rainfall in the world, geography, pollution and social inequality create water scarcity issues across the region. The Caribbean islands are some of the most vulnerable countries in the world to water shortages. The impact of climate change is expected to significantly raise the sea level, increase salt-water intrusion, flooding and hurricanes, and decrease rainfall. Today, the islands are experiencing the worst drought conditions in 5 years. Puerto Rico, St. Lucia, and Cuba are all experiencing severe drought conditions and have implemented strict water conservation restrictions. In addition, according to Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), Caribbean electricity costs are sky high with tariffs ranging between US $0.30 cents and US $0.40 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). These rates are approximately four times the average rate in North America. \n\"Water shortages are impacting the tourism industry across the Caribbean and our customers are looking to do their part. On some islands, governments are imposing fines on people and businesses for improper water use,\" said Marco Giancola, vice president of operations at Worldwide Laundry. \"The Xeros Commercial Laundry Systems provides our customers with a solution that offers great cleaning results while dramatically reducing both water and energy consumption.\" \nThe Xeros laundry system replaces up to 80% of the water with 1.5 million polymer beads to provide superior cleaning results as compared to conventional aqueous washing methods. By combining the beads' molecular structure with a proprietary detergent solution, dirt from soiled items is attracted and absorbed by the beads, producing cleaner results in ambient water. The reusable beads have a lifespan of hundreds of washes before being collected and recycled for reintroduction into the polymer supply chain. The patented, award-winning system uses 80% less water, up to 50% less energy, and approximately 50% less detergent than traditional systems. \n\"Xeros is continuing to rapidly expand worldwide bringing our sustainable near-waterless laundry system to geographic markets that are experiencing high water and energy costs as well as drought conditions,\" said Jonathan Benjamin, President, Global Commercial Laundry at Xeros. \"Our partnership with Worldwide Laundry and expansion in Latin America and Caribbean is a testament to the superior technology, service and industry partnership that Xeros has as a growing, global company.\" \nFor More Information Click here to view a video on how the Xeros polymer bead laundry cleaning system works. \nAbout Xeros Cleaning Xeros is changing the way textiles are cleaned.
