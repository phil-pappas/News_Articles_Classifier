Davidson. Davidson became the brand’s first design director in 1963. He created designs that defined the brand’s factory custom motorcycles for nearly 50 years. Classic motorcycles designed by his styling studio included the Super Glide, which established the factory custom category in 1971; Low Rider; Heritage Softail Classic; Fat Boy; V-Rod; and Street Glide.\nThe exhibition includes his watercolors and personal memorabilia that inspired him. Known as “Willie G.,” he is the grandson of one of the brand’s founders, William A. Davidson.\nFilm to feature U.S. national parks\nA new 3-D film about America’s national parks will be hitting IMAX theaters worldwide next year with Robert Redford as its narrator.\nThe film, “National Parks Adventure,” scheduled for release in February, will coincide with the centennial of the National Park Service next year.\nThe movie captures the beauty of these preserved wild places and unique landscapes with the goal of inspiring travelers worldwide to visit.\nRedford also stars with Nick Nolte in “A Walk in the Woods,” expected in theaters in early September, based on author Bill Bryson’s funny account of walking the Appalachian Trail.\nAirbnb expands listings in Africa\nAirbnb reports that it has more than doubled its listings for Africa in the last year.\nGrowth has included a more-than-double overall increase in the number of people staying in Airbnb listings on the continent, as well as a more than doubling of Africans using Airbnb.\nFor example, in Kenya there are now more than 1,400 listings available to book through Airbnb, with more than half of them in Nairobi.\nListings around the continent range from a studio on a lagoon in Namibia that promises “birdwatching from your doorstep” for $45 a night to $60-a-night guest rooms in a beach house on the Indian Ocean on the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T01:50:21.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
