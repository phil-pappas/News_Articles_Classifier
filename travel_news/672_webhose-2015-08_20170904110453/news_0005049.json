It is starting to feel that way, as software, and the coding skills that create it, powers an increasing part of the machinery powering so much of our daily lives. So how do you avoid being swallowed up with the rest of us? Understanding code itself is the best place to start, and like any living language, nothing stays the same for long. Languages such as CSS and HTML are core parts of the syllabus for many coders today, but such is the pace of technological change that, for every new trend in platforms or process, there is a new niche skill set thrust into the limelight. It is why companies such as Makers Academy are so busy. Based in Shoreditch, home of London’s Tech City, Makers runs an intensive computer programming boot camp for people who want to learn to code. The aim is to transform them from web-development novices into job-ready junior software developers in just 12 weeks. The online learning market is awash with coding courses, and there is a huge divergence in the way their coding skills are taught. Sam Morgan, a coach at Makers, explains: “One of the issues we have with a lot of the coding courses that are available is that they are so abstract. They teach people to write code for totally irrelevant things. We focus on orientating students around real-life scenarios, and real-world challenges.” Look at how often your iPhone updates. Someone has to write the code and push it live. The scale of labour required is huge One myth that the Makers Academy has worked hard to dispel is that coding is only for computer scientists. Its students are an eclectic bunch, with a mix of ages (from 18 to 62), educational backgrounds and life experiences. Their goals range from embarking on a serious career change to simply learning something new. Students undergo a four-week pre-training course , during which they can familiarise themselves with the programme learning materials. This is followed by 12 weeks of coding boot camp. The curriculum is updated every six weeks to stay abreast of industry trends and, by liaising with technology firms and employers, the Academy ensures that their graduates are equipped to address current skills gaps. “It is intensive, and during the first six weeks there is a fairly high level of support, but during the second half of the course, as the projects become more extended, the hand-holding is gradually withdrawn. With coding, learning is all about doing,” says Morgan. And there is more reason than ever to do it. The UK’s STEM (science, technology, engineering mathematics) skills gap is widening, and employers simply cannot find enough coders to keep up with their needs. Lap-top of the class: there is a huge divergence in the way coding skills are taught “Jobs that require good coding skills are being created at twice the national average, and there are estimates of around a million new developers a year being required,” says Morgan. The reason for this escalating demand is that software is embedded in absolutely everything. Entire industries, from retail and finance to manufacturing and telecommunications, are now reliant on it to automate and streamline their business processes. Look no further than the rise of the smartphone, says Morgan. “On the one hand, the software is ballooning, yet the labour required is less obvious. Look at how often your iPhone updates. Someone has to write the code and push it live. The scale of labour required is huge,” he says. Of course, getting through coding boot camp is one thing. Succeeding as a software developer is another. According to Morgan, the most successful developers are masters of networking and collaboration, driven to overcome high odds, and resilient enough to forge ahead while working within uncertain environments. The pace of change isn’t slowing down, and the focus for today’s web developers is to provide better, more robust code that reflects the future’s changing needs. “Software is eating the world, and it sucks,” says Morgan. “A lot of code was written under very different circumstances. Today the focus is on producing skilled software craftspeople who are outputting high quality, robust code.” When it comes to software, the beast still needs to be fed, but with the right skills, tomorrow’s coders can at least serve up something more refined. • Find out more about coding and how to sign up for Makers Academy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:38:51.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
