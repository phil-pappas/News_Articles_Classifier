This website helped us decide which tours we wanted to do on our own, take the ship's excursion or book a tour with a private company.\" ESTONIA: Walnut Creek residents Lynne and John Cheney spent 11 days on a Baltic cruise at the end of June exploring Oslo, Helsinki, Stockholm, St. Petersburg and other ports, including Tallinn, Estonia (pictured).

During my three weeks there, we had mini trips to other islands, including Santorini (pictured) for three days.\" Advertisement \nTravel tips: \"If you go to Santorini, make sure to visit Oia to catch the most magnificent sunset you've ever seen. It's an event. Everyone gathers to witness the spectacle and applaud it once it has sunk! Hop on as many ferries as you can to different islands. Paros is laid-back with perfect beaches, Mykonos is known as the Ibiza of Greece, Santorini is picturesque -- every island offers something different. Soak up as much of it as you can!\" Share your travels with us! Send your recent vacation selfies to jburrell@bayareanewsgroup.com .
