If your flight is due imminently, cases are taken to a platform and brought to the plane.\nIf there’s still a short while to go before your flight, luggage will be gathered on a per plane basis and taken to the flight when ready. If you’re an eager beaver, and your flight has more than 60 minutes to go, then any baggage is taken to a ‘suitcase hotel’, where it waits before being ready to be gathered for the flight.\nIt looks way more laid back and easy than going through the process of security, the departure lounge, rushing to your gate and waiting to board.\nAt the end of the process your bag, hopefully still intact, is placed gently onto a baggage car to be taken out and put into the plane’s baggage hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:56:46.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
