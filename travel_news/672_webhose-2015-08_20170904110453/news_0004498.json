The man with the Rolex, who identified himself only as “a really big fan”, was trying to explain why he just paid $2,400 (£1,537) for a garish hotel room service menu signed by Elvis. I fumbled for an answer. Adolf Hitler had a fairly major role in the 20th century, I said. For a moment, the Elvis fan stared at me blankly. Then he grinned. “Good answer, man,” he said. “The only other person is Hitler.” There is a special kind of passion that drives collectors of Elvis memorabilia; men and women prepared to spend tens of thousands of dollars to own an otherwise ordinary object that was once touched by the King of Rock and Roll. On Thursday night, several dozen of them gathered in a studio theatre for the biggest-ever auction held on Elvis’s own Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee. Over the course of several hours, spurred by the relentlessly upbeat burbling of the Graceland auctioneer, more than half a million dollars was spent on Elvis relics. Some of the big-ticket items were obvious in their attraction. A personalised Walther PPK 9mm handgun fetched $50,000 (£32,000) alone. Its barrel is engraved with “Elvis” based on the man’s own signature while the grip bears the letters TCB and a small lightning bolt – short form for Elvis’s catchphrase: “Taking Care of Business in a Flash”. A diamond and gold TCB pendant that Elvis gave to Sammy Davis Jr wowed the crowd and was finally won on a $32,000 bid. RCA Australia Award to Colonel Parker for &quot;His Outstanding Management of Elvis Presley 1956-1966 But other sales were harder to fathom. Elvis’s racquetball T-shirt sold for $26,000 and a left-handed racquetball glove went for another $4,000. A copy of his wedding bill – including a handwritten note from an assistant worrying about being double charged for a private jet – got another thousand. Some of the items were strangely intimate. A pair of Elvis’s pyjamas were sold to an Internet buyer for $12,000. They might have been worth more if they had more obvious sweat marks or other signs of wear. Glenn Johnson, a rangy Texan, paid $7,500 for some luggage which included a toiletry case containing a cuticle tool, a comb, and a nail file. He also got a pair of gold-toed socks. Do you feel strange paying money for Elvis socks, I asked. • Elvis Presley is a cultural monument as significant as the Elgin marbles “I used to,” he said. “But not anymore.” Unlike many others in the room, Mr Johnson described his Elvis collecting habits as 70 per cent business and just 30 per cent fandom. He estimates he has around 600 items, worth around $4 million in total. “I have a very diversified portfolio,” he explained. “Gold, silver, real estate, annuities, Elvis.” Nearly 40 years after Elvis’s death on the lavatory while reading The Scientific Search For The Face Of Jesus, the Elvis memorabilia business is still big business. So big, in fact, that Elvis fakes and forgeries can be a lucrative option for criminals looking to get ahead. The possibility of bogus items looms over the market and a week before the sale, organisers were forced to withdraw 14 items because they could not be sure they were real. Among them were some of the highest-profile lots, including a jumpsuit purportedly worn by Elvis during a series of 1973 shows in Las Vegas and a guitar supposedly signed by the King as well as Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. The items had already been included in the glossy auction catalogue and promoted heavily in the press before they were hastily withdrawn. “Upon re-examination, Graceland Authenticated was unable to authenticate these artefacts at this time,” the organisers said in a statement. 1971 Elvis Presley Signed Martial Arts Card with Fingerprints Ultimately, Elvis’s used sneezed-in handkerchief or used toothbrush is only worth something because the man himself still looms large for so many Americans and other fans across the world. The religious preserve relics of their saints and go on pilgrimages to holy sites. The followers of Elvis buy his knick-knacks and come to visit Graceland. Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii In just a few minutes surveying people queuing at the visitors centre I found a couple who had travelled from Los Angeles to get married in Elvis’s own chapel; a women who choked up as she remembered hearing the news of Elvis’s death; and a German man who grew up behind the Iron Curtain and listened to Elvis records smuggled from the West by his aunt. Elvis meant something to all of them, and he still does. In a dreary Memphis motel a few minutes drive from Graceland and its surrounding tourist traps, small-time Elvis collectors gathered in a conference room for a fair. Judy White, who sells Elvis merchandise Among them was Judy White, a cheerful 70-year-old, wearing an Elvis T-shirt and sitting at a small fold-up table with Elvis statues, Elvis playing cards, Elvis magnets and, somewhat inexplicably, a plastic frog with an Elvis hairdo. When Judy needed to check the time she glanced at one of the two Elvis watches she wore on her wrist – but she was in no hurry as she described how she met Elvis as a teenage girl on a football field a few miles away. “He was just the prettiest man I had ever seen. Pretty lips, pretty eyes, blue-black hair.” She sighed happily. “There will never be another Elvis.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:17:34.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
