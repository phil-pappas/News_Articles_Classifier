The diverse collection of stables allows the City to cater to a range of individual levels of experience and interests. From beautiful woodland trail riding to child-friendly pony rides, there’s something for everyone. \n“Visitors and locals are invited to experience New York City’s unique, lush-green trails on horseback,” said Fred Dixon, president and CEO of NYC & Company. “The City offers ample opportunities for beginners and experts alike to enjoy riding through the urban great outdoors, from riding into the sunset to private group lessons for the entire family.” A listing of some key equestrian facilities include: The Bronx Equestrian Center, located in Pelham Bay Park, offers trail rides for visitors of all riding abilities (and at least 4.5 feet tall) along the park’s bridle path, providing a scenic setting amidst the woods and marshlands. Pony rides, perfect for the little ones, are also offered in a designated pony ring with no minimum age requirement. No appointments are needed for both the trail and pony rides, which are available every day from 9 am until dark. The center also offers English and Western riding lessons by appointment. Jamaica Bay Riding Academy, a family-owned equestrian facility in Brooklyn since 1972, offers daily guided horseback rides along a serene beachfront and pristine wooded trails for riders aged 16 and older. Pony rides for children aged 8 and younger, and private lessons are also available. Kensington Stables, also in Brooklyn, offers scenic horseback trail rides for visitors of all riding levels (and at least 11 years old) along a woodsy 3.5-mile bridle path through Prospect Park. Visitors can also opt for pony rides, free stable tours and lessons in English and Western riding styles. Trail and pony rides are available daily from 10 am until sunset, and advanced reservations are advised. With an emphasis on teaching proper riding techniques, Lynne’s Riding Center in Forest Hills, Queens, encourages lessons that begin in an indoor ring and progress to the bridle paths of Forest Park. Visitors can also book in advance for horse and pony rides in the indoor ring (age 4 and up), and for a “barn experience,” which includes grooming the horses and learning about the cowboy history of New York. The business operates daily from 8 am until 5 pm. The recently renovated Riverdale Stables is situated on 21 acres of the historic Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Visitors (6 years and older) can enjoy horseback riding during private and group lessons in its indoor and outdoor arenas, 7 days a week. On Mother’s Day and Father’s Day the stable offers drop-in pony rides in the afternoon for children ages 4 and older in the indoor or outdoor arenas.
