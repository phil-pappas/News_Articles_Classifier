Only this princess hangs out of her crashed carriage, apparently dead, as paparazzi look on.\nA Banksy piece depicting an orca whale jumping out of a toilet is displayed at Banksy's biggest show to date, entitled 'Dismaland', during a press viewing in Western-super-Mare, Somerset, England, Thursday, Aug. 20, 2015. (Photo: Yui Mok/AP Photo)\nThe project, staged in a run-down site home to a former outdoor pool in southwestern England's Weston-super-Mare, is Banksy's biggest show to date. It includes new works from Banksy, as well as art galleries featuring some 50 international and British artists including Damien Hirst. Musical performances and arcade games complete the experience.\nAmong the darkly amusing exhibits: a sculpture of a woman attacked by a cloud of seagulls, a killer whale leaping out of a toilet bowl and a pond where visitors can steer model boats crammed with migrants.\nLocal residents had been kept in the dark about the project, and were told the space was being turned into a film set.\nThe park opens Saturday and runs until Sept. 27.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/587bcfd7ea800c61ee7b5ffaa8bcbefa9fdf3389/c=0-0-3329-2503&r=x383&c=540x380/local/-/media/Phoenix/WiresImages/2015/08/21/006104875a30ab257f0f6a7067001d4a.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/Phoenix/WiresImages/2015/08/21/006104875a30ab257f0f6a7067001d4a.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-21T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T21:38:42.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
