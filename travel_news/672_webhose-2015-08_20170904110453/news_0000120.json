Other counties in the top ten include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Pakistan.\nChinese guest numbers rose 72% year-on-year, with 102,217 guest arrivals delivering 148,842 guest nights, although their length of stay dropped by 18% to 1.46 nights.\nRussian guests showed the largest drop, by 10%, to 14,453 guest arrivals, which the authority says could be attributable to difficult economic conditions in Russia. In an effort to stimulate consumer interest and awareness from Russia and the CIS states, a special Abu Dhabi Festival featuring a host of the emirate’s tourism providers will be held in Moscow‘s Hermitage Gardens later this month, dedicated to the emirates’ culture and traditions and vibrant sports and events calendar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:40:53.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
