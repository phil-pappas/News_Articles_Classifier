After that, he will be able to head home after posting a $10,000 bond, returning to Hawaii for court dates.\n\"He's sorry the whole thing happened,\" Peter Wolff, Schneider's federal public defender, said after the detention hearing in federal court. Schneider, a waiter and student, doesn't remember what happened, Wolff said.\nSchneider, who wore a prison jumpsuit to the hearing in Honolulu, was travelling with his girlfriend on the Delta Air Lines flight Monday. He had a double tequila cocktail and demanded more alcoholic drinks, according to the FBI's criminal complaint.\nTwo hours into the flight, passengers seated near Schneider started pushing their call lights, complaining that he was making threats and wanting to move seats, the court documents said.\nWhen a flight attendant tried to calm Schneider, he became more agitated, swearing at the crew member, advancing on him and then pushing him.\nThen, \"when a nearby passenger tried to calm Schneider down, Schneider threatened to kill the passenger,\" the complaint says.\nThe flight attendant followed Schneider to the galley area, where there was another physical confrontation, ending with Schneider falling into a passenger's lap.\n\"Simultaneously, Schneider grabbed the curtain between the galley and the passenger seating area, and ripped it off its rings,\" an FBI agent wrote in the complaint.\nWhen he was restrained with plastic handcuffs, he slid one of his hands out, the complaint said.\nFlight attendants were able to restrain Schneider before the flight landed, Delta said in a statement. Law enforcement officers were waiting when the flight arrived.\n___\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa .\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T09:55:04.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
