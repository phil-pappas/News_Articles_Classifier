That’s why it’s so important to travel with a bag of health and wellness essentials, designed to protect you against unforeseen nasties – and help you on the road to recovery if and when you get sick on your travels. \nHere’s a roundup of the essential travel products we recommend you take with you when travelling around Australia. Whether it’s an instant hangover cure or energy-boosting natural oils that give jet lag the flick, these products all deserve a place in your backpack, handbag or carry-on bag. Bare Naturals Lip Balm 1. Lip balm/all-round-healer \nAn all-natural lip balm isn’t simply useful for keeping your lips well-conditioned during your trip! They can also pull double duty as a protection against wind and cooler weather. When I travelled to Sydney during winter last year, I slathered Bare Naturals Lip Balm (AU$9.99) all over my kids’ mouths, upper lips and chin to help sooth their red, irritated skin against wind-burn. Hand-made pots of mainly organic ingredients, mixed with various essential oils including vanilla, lime, ginger, rose and peppermint, take up next to no room in your bag and will serve to moisten, nourish and protect your lips and chaffed, red skin when you need it most. HeadsUp Relief 2. Miracle Hangover Cure \nYou’ve happened across a brilliant bar on your travels and met some great locals, who introduced you to a few more fun and fabulous watering holes. You stumble back to your room at 3am, a little worse for wear, and the reality hits that you’ve pre-booked a tour at 7am the next morning. Rescue yourself from hangover hell with HeadsUp Relief , which delivers a potent mix of natural plant extracts, vitamins and minerals to help combat hangover toxins head-on. Take four tablets for optimum results, any time before your head hits the pillow (AU$9.95 for a pack of 4). Natural Instinct Hydrating Cleansing Facial Wipes 3. Wipes \nIt doesn’t matter whether you’re travelling solo, with a group of friends, with your partner or your family – whatever your travel party looks like, wipes are always handy on holidays. They not only help you to deal with unexpected spills and messes in your bags, but they’re ideal to wipe down dirty tables in busy food courts, clean your hands after exploring natural attractions and refresh your face and hands mid-flight. Try Natural Instinct Hydrating Cleansing Facial Wipes (AU$7.95), made with aloe vera and rosehip oil: it delivers a powerful boost of moisture to reinvigorate skin that has become dry or dull during travel. Stephen Swintek/Getty Images 4. Headache Tablets \nTrue, you can always pick some up from a chemist or supermarket on your travels. But if a throbbing headache strikes while you’re in transit on a flight , or adventuring off the beaten track in a remote area of Australia, your day will be ruined thanks to your throbbing head. Packing a 6-12 pack of ibuprofen or paracetamol tablets takes up barely any room and could rescue you from a nightmare migraine. Little Bairn's Skin Balm 5. Baby Balm \nFor those are travelling with tiny people in their party, Little Bairn's Skin Balm can be a real winner. The Australian made, eco-friendly balm is packed full of vitamins and essential fatty acids to help soothe inflamed skin, add moisture to dry skin, and heal red, irritated nappy rashes. It's compact size makes it easy to carry around in a handbag or in carry-on luggage. Rescue Remedy 6. Rescue Remedy \nScared of flying? Feeling a little anxious about your trip? The unique combination of Bach flowers in Rescue Remedy could be just the cure to what ails you! According to its makers, Rescue Remedy (around AU$22) leverages the Bach flower theory, which “may help a person to maintain a calm and aware state of mind during chaos”. Basically, it aims to help people through stressful situations; it’s also been said to help calm children down when they’ve suffered an injury. Berocca 7. Cold and Flu cure-alls \nThere are few things that can kill your holiday mood quite like a cold. When your nose is blocked, you’re eyes are watery and you’re coughing like crazy, the last thing you feel like doing is exploring your new city. Berocca will be your best friend in this instance: loaded with Vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12, it gives you a powerful nutrient boost to help you keep nasty symptoms at bay. If your symptoms worsen, you should head to a local chemist or doctor, but if you just need a little energy boost to get you through a tour, outing or adventure, a stash of Berocca will do the trick.
