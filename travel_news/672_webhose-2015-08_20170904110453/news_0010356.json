LOT And Air New Zealand Offer The Shortest Flight Times From Poland to New Zealand Published on : Monday, August 31, 2015\nTwo Dreamliners, one transfer, and just a little longer than 25 hours of flight time! LOT and Air New Zealand offer now the shortest flight times on one ticket from Warsaw to Auckland, New Zealand. This is the advantage of LOT’s new destination: Tokyo. The route between Warsaw and Japan’s capital will be operated by LOT, and the route between Tokyo and Auckland will be operated by Air New Zealand. Tickets are now on sale for flights in or after January. They are available from LOT Travel, LOT’s Call Centre and travel agents.\n“So far, passengers flying from Poland have not been able to travel to New Zealand without at least two stops which has made the journey quite uncomfortable for some of them. With our flights to Tokyo to be introduced as soon as January, it will be possible to travel to Auckland with just one comfortable transfer at Narita Airport. Also, the entire journey will take place on board two Dreamliners: LOT’s 787-8 and Air New Zealand’s 787-9. This is yet another way to ensure the highest level of comfort of passengers travelling from Poland to New Zealand” says Jiri Marek, LOT Sales and Distribution Executive Director.\nDirect flights from Tokyo to Warsaw will be available from 13 January, same as connecting flights by LOT and Air New Zealand to New Zealand. The Auckland route will operate with the following schedule:\nWAW – NRT LO 079 1500 – 0920+1\nNRT – AKL NZ 094 1425-0510\nAKL – NRT NZ 095 0115-0815\nNRT – WAW LO 089 1105 – 1440\nSource:- LOT Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:49:38.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
