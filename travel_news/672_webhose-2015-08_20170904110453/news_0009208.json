The first dramatically remodeled and expanded exhibit—a sprawling but safely fenced $600,000 recreation area for his four Bengal tigers—debuts at a special event for GoFundMe donors of $500 and up this Saturday, Aug. 22. \nFelines that had just 300 square feet to roam and a 6-foot galvanized tub will now have a 12,000-square-foot playpen that includes a 25-foot swimming pool with waterfall and a three-story play structure. Visitors, meanwhile, will be able to peer at their antics from one of four bulletproof windows, or through the 16-foot-high fence. \nThese home improvements are just the start of what Sammut hopes will be a sweeping transformation in the lives of his more than 180 cherished animals, one that creates a unique attraction for the local community and Monterey County in general. \nSammut says he never intended for his critters, many of them rescues from circuses, carnivals or medical crises, to while away the hours cooped up when he started Wild Things in 1983. \"They lived in cages that were pretty much defined by the Department of Fish and Game, and they spent very little time in their cages because we were doing so much film work back then,\" noted Sammut, a former Monterey County policeman. \nWhile his big cats, primates and other animals were still busy with show business, Wild Things began offering once-daily tours of the facility, \"so that people wouldn't feel we were doing anything behind closed doors,\" Sammut said, who oversees a staff of 19. \"People could see what we did and how we did it and why, and we opened to schools too.\" \nIn 2001, he opened the Vision Quest Safari Bed & Breakfast, eight African-style bungalows at Wild Things with views of the Gabilan Mountains and the yard where his herd of five elephants now gambol with two water buffalos, a zebra and an ostrich—after they deliver breakfast to guests with the help of a trainer. The B&B, which Sammut calls \"our pride and joy,\" continues to be a huge draw today; a kennel also operates onsite. \nBut the gradual loss of screen time—as film crews move out of state—meant \"we saw our animals getting out of cages less and less, and it's not what we wanted,\" Sammut said. \"We started exploring the idea of turning the facility into a real zoo.\" The loss of his beloved, 22-year-old lion Josef, the model for \"The Lion King\" animators, in 2008 was also a turning point, according to the zoo's GoFundMe page : \"Charlie made Josef a promise; a promise that would afford the other animals a better quality of life.\" \nA report from the Monterey County Convention and Visitors Bureau that recommended a zoo as an additional incentive for visitors drawn by the Monterey Bay Aquarium provided further impetus, but it took several years to get approvals from the state wildlife agency for his vision, Sammut said. \"We wanted to give our animals much larger-style enclosures, with a lot more things in the enclosures for mental stimulation,\" he explained. \"We're building something that's not described in the code.\" \nFundraising has also has been challenging. \"The greater majority of our clientele are people who really can't afford to contribute the large amount of money it takes to build something like this,\" noted Sammut. \"We got very fortunate with this first exhibit with a very generous donor from Monterey who said go ahead and build it on her; she requested to remain anonymous.\" \nNow that the tiger exhibit offers a dazzling example of what others could look like, Sammut said he hopes some of the deeper pockets in the agricultural community will embrace the project, especially \"since the kids of their workers haves so few choices in Salinas and the negative impact is they end up in gangs. We're hoping this zoo will be one other avenue for them to channel their efforts.\" Latest Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T01:36:43.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
