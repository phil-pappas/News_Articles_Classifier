The flag carrier's board approved the postponement and it will operate four flights per week to Rome with Boeing 747-400 aircraft, it said in a statement.\nThe airline said the route suspension would be temporary once it did take effect and it may resume operations once the company makes progress on a restructuring.\nThe postponement came a few weeks after it decided to suspend loss-making flights to Los Angeles and Rome and cut 1,401 jobs through voluntary retirement this year as it pushes ahead with restructuring.\nThai Airways is among several state-controlled companies that the military government has targeted for reform since seizing power in May 2014.\nIts two-year restructuring plan involves reducing operating costs and capacity by 20 percent, selling aircraft and cutting jobs.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:50:35.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
