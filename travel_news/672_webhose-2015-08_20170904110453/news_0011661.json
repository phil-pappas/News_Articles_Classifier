The result is a backlash from students, parents and teachers with high numbers of students opting out of tests.\nTest scores provide a valuable snapshot of what individuals have learned and how well schools are teaching them. But too much unnecessary or redundant testing detracts from learning and wastes time.\nThe Legislature should ease the burden on students and, in turn, improve participation.\n About half of Washington’s 11th-grade students refused to take the federally mandated Smarter Balanced Assessment this past year. Their rebuff is understandable — these students had been tested the year before, and many already had satisfied the state’s high-school graduation requirement.\nThe resistance rose after the federal government began mandating high-school tests in 11th grade while the state continued to require tests in 10th grade. In the past, Washington students met both state and federal requirements with the 10th-grade test.\nStarting last year, high-school students were asked to take the tests in both their sophomore and junior years. That will continue until 2018, when the state and federal timelines realign.\nMeantime, high-school students face a testing labyrinth.\nState lawmakers must ensure that testing remains a useful tool to track student progress and achievement, not an onerous hardship.” Some tests satisfy the high-school exit-exam requirement, are used for college placement, or both, but figuring that out can be tricky. The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction gets calls daily from parents and school counselors asking for clarification.\nState lawmakers should streamline testing as soon as possible. Proposals to do so this past legislative session were defeated by legislators concerned about lowering standards. But the rate of students opting out of testing shows the system’s complexity doesn’t help students or schools.\nWashington allocates half of its state budget to education; taxpayers deserve a report on that investment.\nBut too much testing strains students and schools.\nState lawmakers must ensure that testing remains a useful tool to track student progress and achievement, not an onerous hardship.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
