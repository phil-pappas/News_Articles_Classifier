There's nothing quite like blue cod for dinner, caught earlier that day. If you prefer dry land, stick with seafood chowder at the South Seas Hotel or pick up fish and chips from the Kai Kart. \n2 Visit an island \nUlva Island is one of NZ's few open island bird sanctuaries and home to many threatened species that flourish in the safe environment. Weka, tui and saddleback are among the native bird inhabitants. \nSome of the rarest plants in the world also thrive here and stately native trees that have stood for centuries. These, along with white, sandy beaches and sparkling turquoise waters, make the island a memorable spot for nature lovers. \n3 Take a flight \nA scenic flight over Stewart Island and the Rakiura National Park is ideal for visitors short on time. For a guaranteed thrill, land on wild Mason Bay beach. \n4 Spot a kiwi \nOur flightless bird thrives on Stewart Island - it's home to more than 20,000 kiwi. Take a guided twilight tour from Halfmoon Bay and chances are you'll see one. Ad Feedback \n5 Hit the tracks \nWith just 28km of roads but 240km of walking tracks, the island is the perfect place to explore on foot. There are plenty of short easy walks as well as challenging ones for hiking enthusiasts, including the Rakiura Track, one of NZ's Great Walks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:34:46.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
