Our National Archaeological Institute has selected 25 of the more than 3,700 sites for the project ‘Adarsh Smarak’ that in these areas it will ensure that many services - including wireless, transportation, and signs are in some cases innovative. There is also a communications campaign called ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ linked to the protection and safety with the slogan ‘Swachh Smarak: Swachh Bharat’ (monuments clean: clean India),\" concluded C.
