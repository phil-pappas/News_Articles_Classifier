Other airlines, including American Airlines and United Airlines, Air Canada, Air France and Qantas have also announced a similar ban. \nThe bans come amid unprecedented international outrage over an American dentist's killing of a lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe. The incident also set off a fierce debate in neighbouring South Africa over the practice of hunting captive-bred lions. \nIan Michler, an independent film maker, says that around 1,000 lions bred in captivity in South Africa are killed every year by trophy seekers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:15:35.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
