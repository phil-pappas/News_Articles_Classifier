Photographer's Note \nSince 1962 Curitiba has a bit of Japan in the Agua Verde neighborhood. Built between 1985 and 1962, the Japan Square is a tribute to Japanese immigrants in the city, also responsible for the development of the state economy, especially in agriculture. Following the traditional line of Japanese gardens, the square has a pond with colorful carps (called nishikigoi), over thirty cherry trees from Japan and a tea house (showed in the photo). In 1979, two other symbols were installed, a lantern carved in stone, donated by the legislative assembly of Hyogo, and the image of Buddha, representing the religion practiced by most Japanese. In 1993, the first local revitalization action and a Japanese Portal was Built and the tea house transformed in the Memorial of Japanese Immigration where are performed the ceremonies of tea, among other celebrations. Inside the memorial there is a museum, carrying a model of Himeji Castle, one of the world heritage sites. To further complement during the celebration of 100 years of Japanese immigration in Brazil, the square underwent an extensive renovation in 2008, which included restoration in electrical installations and hydraulic. Also opened a library in the tea house with publications in Portuguese and Japanese.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T07:54:00.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
