Yesterday, Air Canada welcomed an estimated 141,000 customers on board its aircraft, and today forecasted bookings indicate that number is expected to grow to approximately 150,000.\n“We are delighted customers are choosing Air Canada in record numbers for their travel plans,” said Benjamin Smith, President, Passenger Airlines at Air Canada. “In this peak summer holiday period, we are seeing consistently high record-breaking passenger numbers on a daily basis which speaks to the trust and loyalty customers place in Air Canada as well as the range of travel products and scope of our growing global network. The introduction of new routes, success of Air Canada rouge, renewal of our fleet with the Boeing Dreamliner featuring our brand new international product, and recognition of our most loyal customers through the Altitude program are all coming together to boost customer demand, including increasing numbers of connecting customers via Toronto Pearson and our other hubs across Canada. Today, we expect to break yesterday’s record and serve approximately 150,000 customers. To put this in context, it is equivalent to transporting in a single day the population of an entire mid-size Canadian city such as Abbotsford, B.C., Oshawa, Ontario, or Sherbrooke, Quebec. I thank the more than 28,000 employees of Air Canada, Air Canada rouge and our Air Canada Express regional partners for their focus on taking care of customers and transporting them safely to their destination during this busy travel season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T07:55:16.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
