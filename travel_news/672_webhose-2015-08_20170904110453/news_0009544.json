Ask about student and 60+ discounts If you're studying, always ask for student discount; they may not advertise it but they may offer it.\n4. Check currency rates well in advance Getting your currency converted at a better rate can save you loads of cash. Shop around for the best rates, and start checking out prices at least a month before you travel.\nFor help on how to find the best price, see our guide on the secrets to the best rates or our tips on how to use prepaid currency cards .\n5.
