Scott Morrison and George Brandis are among those who have traded blows.\n“I think it’s gutless. It’s a breach of the rules,” Senator Abetz, who is Government Leader in the Upper House, said of the media leaks.\n“If somebody is gutless and in breach of the rules, one really wonders why a journalist even bothers to repeat comments from such an individual.\n“Every now and then you have these breakouts, which are unfortunate. Those journalists that deal with those people should be asking the question: What motivates?”\nMeanwhile, Tony Abbott wants his ministers to talk only about jobs, growth and community safety.\nThe PM today simply noted “everyone knows the rules” when asked about Senator Abetz’ comments.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey stuck to the official line, deflecting a question about Mr Abbott’s grip on the leadership by saying, “As I’m concerned, it’s jobs, jobs, jobs.”\nHe also told Melbourne’s 3AW: “There has been a temptation for some to pass comment on other issues.”.\nMeanwhile, Tony Abbott checks out the back end of some cattle in Yass.
