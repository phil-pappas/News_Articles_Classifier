(CNN) Before there was Disney World, there was nothing... or in Orlando, Fla., there was very little. In 1971, Walt Disney transformed 40 miles of unwanted land into what is now \"the most magical place on earth.\" Since then, others have followed suit, and Orlando now houses seven of the world's top 25 theme parks , making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, luring in 60 million visitors each year. The bulk of the city's tourists come to pay homage to the mouse. Last year, Disney World welcomed almost 20 million, retaining its position as the world's most popular theme park. Since its launch, the Magical Kingdom has grown, and today houses 30 hotels, 300 restaurants and ever-expanding roster of attractions for \"kids of all ages.\" Though summer is peak time, when the park stays open later to meet demand, Disney World remains popular in all seasons. \"There's actually isn't a slow time of the year anymore,\" says George A. Kalogridis, president of Walt Disney World Resort. World's most popular theme parks One reason for the park's success is the frequent release of Disney movies, which leads to a constant supply of fresh attractions. Disney World receives details of new releases three years in advance so that star characters and experiences can be prepared. The Kingdom also stays ahead through its innovative use of technology. The billion-dollar Magic+ system uses a biometric wristband that covers the entire site, serving as ticket, room key, and method of payment, while also eliminating the need for physical barriers. It connects to a mobile app that maps the resort and provides waiting times and speedy booking options. \"We're just beginning the journey with this type of technology,\" says Kalogridis. \"The list of where we would like to use it is endless.\" A new contender", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:43:59.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
