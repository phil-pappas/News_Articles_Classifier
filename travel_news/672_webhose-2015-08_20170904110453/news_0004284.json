She was 72.\nSpanish police said Sunday that the singer died Saturday at her home in Estepona, southern Spain. Black’s spokesman, Nick Fiveash, confirmed her death and said details would be released after a coroner’s report was completed.\nBlack was born Priscilla White in Liverpool, northwest England, in 1943. As a teenager she sang part-time and worked in the cloakroom of the Cavern Club, where her musical talent was spotted by rising local stars The Beatles.\nSigned by the Fab Four’s manager, Brian Epstein, she had a string of hits starting in 1964 with “Anyone Who Had a Heart,” written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and “You’re My World.” Both went to No. 1 in Britain, and the latter also charted in the U.S.\nMost Read Stories Man shot dead in South Seattle while on phone with mom Seattle company copes with backlash on $70,000 minimum wage Impressions from Day 2 of Seahawks' training camp Seahawks sign four-year extension with linebacker Bobby Wagner worth a reported $43 million Higher wages a surprising success for Seattle restaurant Ivar's She also had success with the Bacharach-David theme tune for the 1966 film “Alfie,” and recorded several Beatles songs, including “The Long and Winding Road.”\nBy the late ’60s she was famous enough to be known by her first name alone, and hosted a BBC variety show, “Cilla.”\nWith her reliable good cheer and tireless work ethic, Black was a TV natural. Her catchphrase — delivered in a strong Liverpool accent that replaced the letter “t” with “r” — was “a lorra, lorra laughs.”\nShe became a British television fixture as the cheeky, cheery host of matchmaking game show “Blind Date” (between 1985 and 2003) and heartwarming-reunion program “Surprise Surprise” (between 1984 and 2001).\n“She always felt like a friend in your living room, on your TV screen,” television executive Michael Grade told Sky News.\nIn a tweet, her friend Joan Collins called Black “a resplendent and rare talent.”\nBlack’s husband of 30 years, Bobby Willis, died in 1999. She is survived by their three sons.\n___\nAP Writer Harold Heckle in Madrid contributed to this report.\nJILL LAWLESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T19:01:48.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
