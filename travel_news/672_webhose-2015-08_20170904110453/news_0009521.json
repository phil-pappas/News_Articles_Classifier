Extended to connect with mainline trains at East Grinstead in 2013, it puffs 11 miles through Sussex countryside to Sheffield Park stopping at Horsted Keynes and Kingscote. The journey takes 40 minutes each way with a wait in the middle – enough time to explore the Carriage Workshop at Horsted Keynes and have a picnic. There’s a grassy picnic area fringed with woodland just up from the station with picnic tables. Children’s week (August 1-7) features donkey rides, circus workshops and Punch and Judy shows.\nReady to depart … the journey from Sheffield Park to East Grinstead takes 40 minutes unless you stop off. Photograph: Alamy Fun fact\nOne of the carriages being restored in the workshop was originally used by a travelling circus to transport elephants.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Is this my carriage?’ … the Bluebell Railway isn’t just for adult steamheads\nBest thing(s) about it?\nThis is time travel – old-style stations, uniforms, locos and carriages. Chuffing through the Sussex Weald, people waving as you pass, offers a real sense of theatre. Joseph (aged 5) loved exploring the huge loco sheds, seeing ancient carriages being restored, dressing up as a driver and pulling levers in the signal box. Friendly volunteer staff bring the place alive.\nWhat about lunch?\nGood-value pub grub (pie and chips £8.40, veggie lasagne £6.95) at the Bessemer Arms . Reasonably priced snacks from the station cafes at Horsted Keynes and Kingscote. Tea carriage at East Grinstead. Grassy picnic areas at all stations except East Grinstead. The train’s buffet car serves coffee, wine and cakes.\nExit through the gift shop?\nThere’s one at Sheffield Park but it’s aimed at rail enthusiasts more than kids. You can use the platform exit if you prefer.\nGetting there\nEasy car access to Sheffield Park and East Grinstead. Or take the train to East Grinstead from London Victoria.\nValue for money?\nFor unlimited travel, access to loco sheds and museum it’s decent value: adult £17, child £8.50, family £45.50. In children’s week, kids’ tickets cost £1.\nVerdict\n8/10", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+the+Bluebell+Railway%2C+East+Sussex&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fjul%2F28%2Fbluebell-railway-sussex-england-rail-heritage-children&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F7%2F23%2F1437659212408%2F0e97b7a5-ed43-4915-a210-3b6e4101745c-1360x2040.jpeg", "http://www.bessemersheffield.co.uk/", "http://www.bluebell-railway.com/event/childrens-week/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqge%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+the+Bluebell+Railway%2C+East+Sussex&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4aqge%2Fstw%23img-2"], "published": "2015-07-28T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:31:16.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
