However, some artifacts are just now seeing the light after spending at least a decade in asbestos-contaminated metal buildings. Washington, DC - infoZine - Scripps Howard Foundation Wire - The 2015 Smithsonian fiscal year budget allotted $2.51 million to begin construction of a so-called swing space at the Garber Collections Storage Site. In the swing space items contaminated with lead and asbestos will be decontaminated and placed in short-term storage. The Garber facility is located in Suitland, Md., just outside of Washington on 4.5 acres of land that make up the Smithsonian Museum Support Center. “Garber is not seen by people. These are buildings that if we had the funds we would have had demolished by now. We have had other priorities,” chief spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas said, during an interview about general renovations. The Paul E. Garber Facility holds nearly 400,000 artifacts from the Smithsonian Institution’s collection. After more than 60 years as museum storage, the buildings will eventually be demolished due to asbestos contamination and structural issues. The facility is not open to the public. SHFWire photo by Sarah Fulton According to a 2005 collections report, the 19 Garber buildings hold over 400,000 objects. The buildings were constructed by the military during World War II. In the 1950s they were transferred to the Smithsonian to be used as storage for 10 to 15 years. More than 60s years later, they are still in use. One building collapsed in 2010 after a heavy snowfall. Several of the buildings were damaged in the 2011 earthquake. Workers cannot enter the three buildings contaminated with asbestos unless they wear hazmat suits. Asbestos is made up of naturally occurring minerals that are fire resistant. It was commonly used in building from the 1800s to the 1980s. However, extended exposure to asbestos has been shown to cause health issues such as lung cancer and mesothelioma. St. Thomas said artifacts in the Garber facility are mostly large and metal. However, they range from costumes to large instruments. “Lincoln’s top hat is not in there. It is not precious artifacts,” St. Thomas said. Most of the items will be moved to temporary storage before being placed in a permanent storage site in Chantilly, Va., about 30 miles west of the Mall, that has not yet been constructed. The site is near the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy National Air and Space Museum.The goal is to eventually incorporate the items into exhibits. Debra Nauta-Rodriguez, deputy director for the planning and program management division, said the Smithsonian eventually hopes to stop using all of the Garber buildings, but it is a multi-decade undertaking. “It is a big complicated puzzle to move collections and get them into a better space,” Nauta-Rodriguez said. The Suitland collections site is not open to the public. St. Thomas said that other more costly renovations are a higher priority for the Smithsonian, including ongoing renovations to the National Museum of Natural History and the National Zoo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T01:35:34.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
