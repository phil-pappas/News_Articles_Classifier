The team of 11, including nine Capita Travel and Events employees, set off from Chinnor, South Oxfordshire at 8am, Saturday 22 August and arrived at their final destination, Avebury in Wiltshire, at 3pm, Sunday 23 August. The team weathered 30-degree heat, humidity, downpours and hail in a challenging trek across a section of the Ridgeway National Trail, a track following an ancient Ridgeway and footpaths from Overton Hill, near Avebury and through the Chiltern Hills to Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire. \nJason Cardy, who organised the group, is events manager at Capita Travel and Events. He said: “We’ve all got a few aches and pains after the trek but it’s nothing compared with what children and young people with cancer endure. We initially aimed to raise £1,000 to help CLIC Sargent provide the vital support that helps children, young people and their families cope with cancer. “Anyone wishing to support our fundraising efforts can visit the Just Giving website and find us by searching for ‘55 Mile Ridgeway Challenge’. We’d like to say a big thank you to our support team; we couldn’t have made it through the weekend without their help.” James McDonald, CLIC Sargent fundraising manager for Oxfordshire said: “I’d like to thank and congratulate the Capita Travel and Events team on completing the Ridgeway challenge and supporting CLIC Sargent. All of their training, sore feet and blisters will help us to support more children and young people who are facing a cancer diagnosis. Every day 10 children and young people hear the shocking news they have cancer. CLIC Sargent provides clinical, practical and emotional support to help them cope with cancer and get the most out of life. “It costs £231 to provide accommodation for a week in a CLIC Sargent Home from Home near to specialist children’s cancer treatment centres. This free self-catering accommodation ensures families can stay close to their child during treatment. The incredible sum raised by the team could provide a week’s accommodation for eight more CLIC Sargent families.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:24:59.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
