Young professional male   \nAug 17, 2015 eTN   \nLONDON, England - As excessive drinking in airports continues to dominate this summer’s headlines, new research from Holiday Extras has revealed that the scale of the issue may be even greater than first feared. What’s more, the identity of the biggest pre-board boozers may come as a surprise! \nThe research reveals that almost half of Brits have witnessed alcohol related problems at the airport. \nPerhaps the most surprising results to come from the poll are the profiles of passengers most likely to push the limits of a pre-trip tipple. With the majority of recent disorderly passenger reports focusing on young people enjoying stag parties, it would be easy to leap to the conclusion that this age group would be most likely to drink in excess. However, this does not appear to be the case. \nThe survey indicates that young professional males aged 25-34 were the biggest drinkers according to the poll. One in 10 people in this age group admitted to drinking a minimum of eight units pre-flight, that is the best part of a bottle of wine or three pints of lager!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T15:53:15.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
