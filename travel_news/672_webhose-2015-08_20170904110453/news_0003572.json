Why don't we take away the hotel disruptors, the Booking.coms, who the hotels generally hate because they charge them 40 percent of their revenue, and sell them for 10 percent?\"\nOne function of the new website will be a fare comparison service that shows the cost of flights from both Ryanair and its rivals.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/ryanair-internet-idUSL5N10M2E120150811"], "published": "2015-08-14T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:48:03.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
