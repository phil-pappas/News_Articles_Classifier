MARY, Mont. (AP) -- Firefighters are conducting burnout operations on the Reynolds Creek Fire in Glacier National Park in an effort to strengthen fire lines. Crews have containment line around 63 percent of the fire that has burned on 5 square miles of land about 4 miles west of the St. Mary Visitor Center. The fire was reported on July 21 and led to the closure of an 18-mile section of the scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road. Winds caused some fire spotting on Thursday. Higher temperatures, wind and low humidity could lead to more flare-ups on Friday. Fire officials gave media members a tour through the still-closed fire area on Thursday, noting improved views of St. Mary Lake through the burn area. Fire information officer Thomas Kimpton pointed out a waterfall that was newly visible. Crews expect the area will continue to burn until it snows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T01:26:32.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
