Details of the visit were still to be released, but a United Nations timetable shows China’s head of state will give a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York on Sept 28 to mark its 70th anniversary. Mr Xi, who took offce in March 2013, joined US President Barack Obama at Rancho Mirage in California during an unofficial visit to the US in June 2013. Xi’s visit is as important as the US visit of Deng Xiaoping in 1979... Yet analyst Liu Yawei has predicted that the upcoming visit could go a long way to addressing misconceptions about China among the American people. “Since last year, the Americans have been losing faith in ... what kind of superpower Beijing wants the country to become,” Mr Liu, director of the Carter Center’s China Program, told Chinese media recently. “Xi’s visit is as important as the US visit of Deng Xiaoping in 1979, which changed American views on the Chinese overnight.” Mr Deng’s nine-day tour, which included meeting President Jimmy Carter, was the fi rst by a Chinese leader after the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Mr Liu said images of Deng kissing American children after a gala performance at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington moved many people, dissolving some fear over a communist threat. It will be an important visit that will lay out the blueprint for relations and inject new impetus to the new model of major country relationship Mr Xi’s previous visits to the US have already had a similar effect, he added, such as in 2012 when, as vice-president, he visited a family he had stayed with in Iowa during a trade mission in 1985. On another level, Wang Fan, vice-president of China Foreign Affairs University, said the focus of the September visit could be to establish “understanding and designs” for a new type of major country relationship. “New problems are emerging with the rise of China,” he said. “If we can reach some new understanding with the US on a strategic level, it will play an incomparable role in stabilising and developing relations.” Leaders in both countries have reached a consensus that they “cannot benefit from each other’s problems, as we are interdependent”, and have tried to avoid confrontation, Mr Wang said. The world’s two largest economies have witnessed closer ties in a wide spectrum of areas, from tourism to education. However, strategic distrust remained, as manifested by differences in cybersecurity, China’s maritime territorial disputes with some neighbouring countries, the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia, as well as the US attitude towards China-proposed projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the US, said the two presidents would take the opportunity in September to have candid and in-depth exchanges on major issues concerning bilateral relations and global peace and development, and would push for closer co-operation and more deliverables. “It will be an important visit that will lay out the blueprint for relations and inject new impetus to the new model of major country relationship,” he said. US officials also have high expectations, including US Secretary of State John Kerry who said it would help other nations to see China and the US work together. Richard Bush, director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies, said the two leaders should avoid polite talk, but not critical issues, and suggested they produce a work plan for the next 18 months — Mr Obama’s remaining time in offoce — to focus on issues that require presidential leadership.
