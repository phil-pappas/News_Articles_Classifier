TUI, which owns the Thomson and First Choice brands, could seek a separate listing of assets such as hotelbeds.com, Crystal Ski Holidays and Hayes & Jarvis, while continuing to retain a stake, London's The Times newspaper reported.\nIn July, TUI sold its 50 percent stake in Greek hotel chain Grecotel, in a deal valued between EUR€40 million and EUR€50 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe company recently said it took a EUR€35 million to EUR€40 million hit for cancelled travel to Tunisia after an attack in late June that killed 38 tourists, mainly Britons.\nTUI was created by last year's merger of London-listed TUI Travel and German owner TUI. It is in the process of simplifying its structure and businesses.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T08:02:52.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
