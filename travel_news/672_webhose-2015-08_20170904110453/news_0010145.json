Such gorgeous characteristics occur only in Ladakh where a natural phenomenon called ‘Tso Moriri’ exists. It is also known as Lake Moriri or ‘Mountain Lake’ and is a beautiful water body in the Ladakhi part of the Changthang Plateau in Jammu & Kashmir. It is 14,836 ft high and is therefore known as the largest of the high altitude lakes in India. It is officially named as the Tso Moriri Wetland Conservation Reserve. The lake has very less for its surroundings to survive. It is oligotrophic in nature which means that it can live in an environment that offers very low level of nutrients. The waters of this lake are alkaline. However it is said that the lake was once a popular source of salt.

You can reach Tso Moriri from Pangong Tso as well. The distance between the two is only 235 km. There are no petrol pumps in the area so make sure you have in stock. The drive is considered to be the most beautiful drives in Ladakh which will soothe your senses. \nThere are two routes to Tso Moriri from Leh: \nLeh- Upshi- Debring- Puga- Tso Moriri \nLeh- Upshi- Chumathang- Mahe- Puga- Tso Moriri Must read: Placid Precious Pure: Pangong Tso \nTso Moriri is an apt spot to relax and indulge into serenity. The landscape is a chain of snow capped mountains shaded in blues and greys.

You will find Tibetan Ass, Black-necked cranes and Bar- headed geese along the lake during summer. Carnivores like Snow Leopard and Tibetan Wolf are also said to be seen here.

The weather is very dry and being at a great height the sun rays hit directly, hence it is advisable to carry sunscreens and lotions to keep your skin hydrated. Pack a lot of food and water for your journey because the area has limited options. The Korzok Monastry is situated on the western bank of the lake which is around 400 years old and is a major attraction for Buddhist pilgrims and tourists. The place is flocked from May to September inspite of tents being the only facility of accommodation available here. There is a small lake at the north east of Tso Moriri which is locally known as Lake of Joy.

This was justified due to its unique fauna. Tso Moriri has threats due to the increased number of tourists visiting here. There have been additional constructions along the lake which is degrading the pastures affecting animals that come to gaze here. There is no proper garbage disposal facility which is littering the surroundings of Tso Moriri. Free Press Journal requests our readers to consider these drawbacks and take the initiative to stop any littering around the lake and take a step towards a better environment.
