While overdevelopment has blighted some of the coastline (the resort of Lloret de Mar accommodates 200,000 tourists at its summer peak), north of Palamós it takes on a quieter, more traditional feel and golden sands give way to the rocky, rugged landscape of cliffs, inlets and hairpin bends that gives the Costa Brava its name: the “rough” or “wild” coast. Joan Roca, one of three brothers who run the world's best restaurant Photo: GETTY Here, a series of small towns (Begur, Tamariu, Palafrugell, L’Estartit, Aigua Blava, Llafranc ) have retained their Catalan charm, each set on a sheltered cove and often boasting a seafood restaurant where the day’s catch is landed fresh and cooked over charcoal. This was the summer playground of the Roca brothers – Joan, Jordi and Josep – who grew up in Girona , 20 miles inland. In 1986 they set up El Celler de Can Roca ( cellercanroca.com ), the three-Michelin-starred restaurant which this year took first place in The World’s 50 Best Restaurants awards, having won once before in 2013 and come second three times in an ongoing duel with Noma in Copenhagen . • El Celler de Can Roca: what does 300 euros buy you at the world's best restaurant? • Where famous chefs love to eat The style is traditional Catalan with surrealist touches, exemplified by such dishes as caramelised olives suspended from a bonsai tree and calamari flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, then blended and piped to form a cracker. Ingredients such as hake, pigeon and pig’s trotter are used, evidence of how the brothers’ haute-cuisine style is rooted in traditional Catalan cooking. Here, Joan (the head chef), Josep (the sommelier) and Jordi (the pastry chef) describe the culinary riches of Catalonia and pick their favourite restaurants. What makes the cuisine special? The landscape and geography of Catalonia are exceptional because in one hour you can go from very high mountains to the sea – so on a short drive the climate, the produce and the culinary nuances change dramatically. That leads to a lot of variety and experimentation in the way we cook. People say the true expression of Catalan culture is in the kitchen. We’ve been writing about gastronomy for eight centuries, so we have a lot of documentation. Villages such as Llafranc have retained their Catalan charm Photo: AP/FOTOLIA What dish sums it all up? Escudella, a traditional soup based around pork. Every part of the pig is good, so in this dish nothing is wasted. You take the pig cheek and the tongue, and you make a pilota – a big meatball flavoured with garlic and parsley, cooked in a broth with seasonal vegetables. The pig is killed in November when you have potatoes and winter vegetables such as celery, cabbage and carrots. Sometimes it’s made with botifarra, a Catalan sausage. Cadaques Photo: AP/FOTOLIA What else should I look out for? Two unique produce are the white kidney-shaped bean mongeta del Ganxet, and a small white bean, fesol de Santa Pau, produced only in the volcanic soil of La Garroxta. Both have DOP (Protected Designation of Origin) status. We have fish and seafood all year, but in summer they are “carnosos” – meaty. The red prawns from Palamós are fantastic, and summer is also the season for lobster and sardines. We have a tradition of using fish and crustaceans in rice dishes – not like a paella, which is dry, but with a lot of liquid. Another speciality is suquet, a stew made with hake or monkfish, squid, clams, prawns and often fish heads – a typical Mediterranean dish. Suquet, a fish stew typical of the region Photo: AP/FOTOLIA The most famous Catalan sauce is romesco, made from hazelnuts, grilled bread, garlic, parsley, nyora red peppers from Tarragona, olive oil and a little vinegar. The other is aioli: mashed garlic, olive oil, and a squeeze of lemon. Finally there is picada, a sauce added as a seasoning to fish dishes. The recipe varies depending on the fish. One typical fish is rascasse [scorpion fish] and the sauce for that is hazelnuts, garlic, parsley and saffron, all mixed with the liver of the scorpion fish and a little bit of the broth it’s cooked in.
