The Northern Territory Government has begun a market sounding process to gauge private interest in redeveloping the Frances Bay basin – aka the ‘Duckpond’ – and the adjoining ‘Gobi Desert’ site.\nChief Minister Adam Giles said the area presented a golden opportunity for an imaginative mixed-use redevelopment which would draw in visitors to the overlooked waterfront location.\n“We’ve seen fabulous waterfront developments occur around Darwin and I believe there’s a great opportunity to rejuvenate Frances Bay,” Mr Giles said.\n“The Duckpond is the heart of our commercial fishing industry and we want to keep it that way.\n“Auckland and Hobart have turned their fishing ports into attractive harbourside destinations, where visitors can enjoy a drink, meal or catch a cruise.\n“Darwin can do the same – and within just a stroll of the CBD. Our vision for Frances Bay would support fishing, tourism and harbourside living while creating new jobs for Territorians.”\nThe site is owned and operated by the Territory Government and the Department of Lands and Planning will be seeking feedback on its future use from business until September 30.\nThe ‘Gobi Desert’ is reclaimed land and developers will be able to consider further reclamation.\nThe city council’s Darwin City Centre Master Plan envisages an enhanced marina in the area and Lands and Planning Minister David Tollner said he would be interested in seeing this for the site.\n“The Duckpond has 85 berths and is at capacity during the wet season, so expanding facilities in Frances Bay will be high on the agenda,” Mr Tollner said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T05:31:19.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
