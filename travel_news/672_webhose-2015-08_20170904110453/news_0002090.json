While in Malaysia, he wore many hats and had been actively involved in the development of tourism in Malaysia. \n\nCredit: Courtesy of Marco Giovanni Battistotti \n\nPrior to his demise, Battistotti was the vice president of operations at Ri-Yaz Hotels & Resorts in Kuala Lumpur, Skal International Asia president, Asia Area, Penang Global Tourism board director and Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) board member. \n\nShaheen Shah, Group CEO, Ri-yaz Group, said: “I have known Marco since 2010 when he was the Penang chapter chairman for MAH. As I represented MAH as the vice president, we worked very closely on various industry programmes together. \n\n“Marco’s outstanding knowledge and vast experience are well-known in the industry. He is a reliable person who keeps his word and is definitely a team player. Honest, caring, hard working, energetic and professional are a few ways to describe Marco. Our sorrow is lessened only slightly with the comforting thought that we had the privilege to know him.” \n\nA good friend, Reginald T Pereira, president and CEO of Aariana Hospitality International and CEO of MIHR Consulting, said: \"I have known Marco since he took up his first assignment in Malaysia at G Hotel in Penang. He was the most down-to-earth, unassuming individual I have ever met. He would go out of his way to make you feel welcome and was such a warm person. \n\n“We became very close especially in his roles with the MAH where I was the CEO. Our friendship grew over the years and we continued to meet regularly even after I left MAH.\" \n\nOoi Geok Ling, formerly the managing director at Penang Global Tourism, said: “I didn’t realise how much he had meant as a friend until he was gone. I feel like I’ve lost a family member.” \n\nA memorial and prayer service will be held for the late Marco Giovanni Battistotti on August 14 at The Eastern & Oriental Hotel, Penang from 18.00. \n\nAccording to Ooi, one of the organisers, the memorial service is open to all those who knew Battistotti and will be a celebration of his life and sharing of his stories among friends. \n\nFor more details about the service, please email rememberingmarcogb@gmail.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:03:27.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
