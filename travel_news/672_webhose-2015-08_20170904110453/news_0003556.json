(AP) â€” A Salt River horse advocate is worried the forest service is going to move forward with its delayed plan to remove a herd from Tonto National Forest land after one of the animals was found dead alongside Bush Highway.\nKPHO-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1NnnMNB) 2.5-year-old Thunder was found Monday near a horse crossing. Investigators say there were skid marks nearby, but could not confirm if a vehicle hit the animal.\nThe forest service's plan to round up the herd over safety concerns was put on hold following an outpouring of opposition.\nSalt River Wild Horse Management Group president Simone Netherlands says she's discussing possible safety precautions with forest service officials this week, like lower speed limits and signs that say \"horse crossing\" instead of \"watch for horses.\"\n___\nInformation from: KPHO-TV, http://www.kpho.com/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.kpho.com/", "http://bit.ly/1NnnMNB)", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T08:33:35.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
