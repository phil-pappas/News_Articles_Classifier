The number of foreign tourists from France also decreased by 22.3 percent, with the number from Italy decreasing by 19.5 percent, in the first half of the year, compared to the previous year. \nThe highest number of tourists came from Germany in the first half of the year, with around 2 million, followed by Russia, with 1.45 million, and Britain, with around 950,000, according to the ministry’s data. \nThe head of the Hoteliers Association (TUROB), Timur Bayındır, told Reuters in May that the decrease in Russian tourists was expected to continue in the coming months, while Western tourists were concerned by ISIL in the region. \nBefore the geopolitical risks rose to unprecedented heights, industry representatives set tourism income for the year at around $30 billion to $35 billion. This figure, however, is now expected to decrease with the rising security concerns. \nThe net tourism income financed around 53 percent of the country’s current account gap at $46.5 billion in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:21:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
