CERRO FITZ ROY DESDE EL MIRADOR FITZ ROY ! MONTE FITZ ROY VISTO DO MIRANTE FITZ ROY ! MOUNT FITZ ROY SEEN FROM THE FITZ ROY LOOK-OUT POINT ! I love cold weather and that's why I decided to go to Southern Argentina on my last vacations!! I knew weather in Patagonia could be tough though, but I took the risk! I faced bad weather and other problems during my traveling, but, no regrets, because I could see many places I wanted to! There were days that weather was fine and I didn't do anything very special, but enjoyed just as well! But that day, I had the best trekking, with fresh snow along the trails and the best views from Mount Fitz Roy! Here, I was at the FITZ ROY LOOK-OUT POINT! I might go back there in summer, because it's easier to walk along the trails and the days are much longer! 1965 photos posted on TE! 1965, the year I was born, 50 years ago!!!
