On Tuesday, representatives from six states spoke at the Mid America Association of State Transportation Officials' annual meeting about their fears for the future of America's transportation system. Here's what they shared: Mike King , Kansas King, who heads the Kansas Department of Transportation , said he's concerned about his state's road preservation needs in the coming decades. King said he's aware the state's infrastructure needs to be improved, and KDOT is trying to figure out the best way to do it and to get people more interested in the condition of the transportation infrastructure. He said he's also monitoring the rise of the 3D printing he wonders how quickly, if ever, a cheap, widely available device could drive down national freight traffic. Driven by the rise of online shopping, the volume of freight is skyrocketing nationwide. Roberta Broeker , Missouri Broeker, interim director of the Missouri Department of Transportation , said she's worried about social and economic issues affecting the nation's long-term stability. She said the gap between the rich and the poor is rising, people are becoming more politically divided and local and national lawmakers are increasingly ineffective when it comes to addressing the nation's issues. These factors are keeping the nation from moving forward and are adversely affecting everything from transportation to healthcare, Broeker said. Broeker and the rest of MoDOT have been watching Missouri's legislature and Congress closely as it negotiates an uncertain funding future . Mark Gottlieb , Wisconsin Echoing Broeker's comments, Mark Gottlieb , head of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, said he's worried about the steady erosion of the public's trust in their institutions. He said he's also seeing a decline in the public's interest in making \"communal\" investments in critical infrastructure that improve the quality of life. Gottlieb said he thinks an increasingly factionalized public is making it difficult for transportation departments to make the case for the value of transportation investments and to accomplish their duty of providing large, public infrastructure everyone depends on. Charlie Zelle , Minnesota Zelle, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said he worries about the funding model for the nation's transportation departments. Declining gas tax revenue means the system that's largely funded transportation for decades won't work going forward, he said. Declining revenue and changing trends in how people travel, he said, will challenge transportation planners to rethink the projects they pursue. Mike Hancock , Kentucky Hancock, secretary of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, said he's concerned about the commonwealth's urban centers and whether \"real\" people will be able to afford living in urban centers in the future. Hancock said there's a lot of optimism about new methods of transportation, but he wonders how many of those choices will be affordable. Hancock said the lack of funding for transportation departments not only presses them to do more projects with less, but also presses staffers to choose other career options. Low pay and low morale make it difficult to retain talented staff members, he said. Randall Blankenhorn , Illinois Blankenhorn, acting Illinois transportation secretary, said declining funding sources will make it difficult for his agency to build and maintain the infrastructure that connects the rural economy to the global economy. Blankenhorn said he's also concerned with the government's inability to react to change and anticipate future transportation needs. \nWant Kansas City Travel news in your inbox?
