PUBLISHED: 09:23, Sun, Aug 9, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:43, Sun, Aug 9, 2015 GETTY Christchurch Bay in Dorest \nThere was barely a cloud in the sky but the pounding increased in volume until six young ponies stampeded from a sunlit glade, galloping wildly through the bracken. To see such unbridled exuberance was a truly unexpected delight which provoked great excitement from our back-seat passengers, Sophie, six, Luisa, seven, and even nine-month-old Cara Rose. “They were galloping at 50 miles per hour!” exclaimed spellbound Sophie. “Cool.” Witnessing nature in the wild put us in just the right mood for more surprises as we entered the Hoburne Naish holiday park, some seven miles from the forest and near the Dorset town of Highcliffe. In a picturesque area called The Dell we found a holiday home that looked remarkably like a log cabin but was subtly constructed of manmade materials. Its insides were reminiscent of a smart hotel with deep-pile carpets and a sophisticated interior design of dark green and black. GETTY Durdle Door Beach in Dorset The main living room was so large it easily accommodated three wonderfully soft two-seater sofas complete with plenty of classy cushions. In the open-plan kitchen there was an American-style fridge with compact and stylish units hiding a washing machine and plenty of cupboards. From the outside the lodge did not appear that big but we were genuinely amazed by the way every inch was utilised to provide three bedrooms and two bathrooms. To the children’s joy there was also a Wii games console which meant that while we tried to plan the day’s activities, they were kept fully occupied. Like millions of people we were well acquainted with Bournemouth and Weymouth, so we wanted to use our time to discover more about less well-known Christchurch Bay which the holiday park overlooks. We set off to explore the park, which had crazy golf, a tennis court, an indoor and heated outdoor swimming pool and a very pleasant pub called the Smuggler’s Retreat, before following a windy footpath to a magnificent stretch of sandy beach with stunning views of the Isle of Wight’s Needles in the distance. The next morning the grey skies burned away to reveal Christchurch Bay in its full glory, mile upon mile of sandy beach with a sandstone backdrop crowned with trees and shrubs.
