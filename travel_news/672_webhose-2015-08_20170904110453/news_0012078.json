On August 19, this threat became a reality when the hackers who stole sensitive customer information, including names, email addresses and credit card information, was dumped online for all to see. The dating service, specialising in “discreet encounters” for those anonymously seeking an affair, has now joined Sony, Vodafone and Snapchat on the list of companies to thus far have their users’ data compromised. So what can companies take away from all this? 1. CRISIS MANAGEMENT IS CRUCIAL Less than 24 hours after the event, Ashley Madison released a statement assuring its members that they had closed any security holes that had allowed the data breach to occur. Yet a subsequent investigation by cyber security pioneer John McAfee showed that this was not the case. Hardly reassuring for the site’s millions of users. 2. ASHLEY MADISON ARE NOT THE FIRST AND THEY WON’T BE THE LAST In recent years, companies have not taken cyber security as seriously as they perhaps should, with Apple, eBay and Vodafone amongst the growing list of targets. When even the world’s most trusted corporations are slipping up, it’s no wonder that consumers are concerned. With credit card details, passwords and personal information at stake, the time for everyone to give cyber security the attention it deserves is long overdue. 3. THE MOTIVATION IS CHANGING Hackers have long been thought of as faceless criminals, accessing your most personal information with a few strokes of the keyboard. But times are changing and a recent rise in politically inspired cyber crime has resulted in an emergence of ‘hacktivists’, pursuing sensitive data for alternative means. Whether right or wrong, the dating site whose tagline is “Life is short. Have an affair” was the latest target of one of these groups. Without knowing their identities or motives, preventative security measures against future attacks are essential. 4. NOW’S THE TIME TO WORK IN CYBER SECURITY With companies finally taking note, the demand for certified cyber security experts is higher than ever. If you think you have what it takes to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems, get ahead of the game and follow this exciting and lucrative career path.
