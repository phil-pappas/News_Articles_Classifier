But while it was like many other “chateau” style hotels he’d designed for the rail company, this one was absolutely enormous compared to the others, and having 618 rooms on a clifftop site it quickly came to dominate Quebec City’s skyline – as it still does today. \nAlthough it was built in 1893, there had been earlier castles and hotels on the site over several centuries, with the last hotel burning down in 1834. \nToday with its cliff-top location and its fairy-tale appearance, Le Chateau Frontenac is listed by the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s officially most-photographed hotel – with many guests saying it’s a true-life castle of their dreams. \nAnd yes, it does take its name from the real thing, Frontenac Castle in France that was built during the Renaissance.
