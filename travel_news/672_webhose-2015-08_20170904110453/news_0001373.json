Natalia Ningthoujam, IANS , New Delhi | Updated: Aug 10, 2015 22:07 IST It's a fun take on the skirt, works well with a kurta for a light mehendi or lunch. (IANS photo) \nTwirling lehengas and floor-sweeping anarkalis always get our attention, but another trend that is soon becoming a hot favourite among would-be brides is the dhoti skirt. \nA dhoti is typically worn by Indian men, and over the years, designers have fused it with western silhouettes to bring out the now globally popular dhoti pants. A dhoti skirt, for women, is an interpretation which has found prominence of late. \nDesigner Anita Dongre has launched her latest bridal collection, 'The Wedding Diaries'; an album of memories of the modern-day bride. While the bespoke bridal couture looks feature lehengas, gowns and anarkalis, there is also a pink dhoti skirt to be paired with a bandi. \n\"A dhoti skirt is a fresh approach to classic skirts with its draped silhouette. This traditional yet funky option is extremely versatile and can be worn with a short tunic, crop top, bandi or even a trendy asymmetrical jacket,\" Dongre told IANS. \nDongre, who will be presenting the collection at The Vogue Wedding Show in partnership with the Taj Group, to be held from Friday to Sunday at the Taj Palace, New Delhi, also shared that though the trend is versatile and can be carried off by women of any age group, \"women between the 22 and 28 age bracket mainly have been seen sporting this trend, more so in Mumbai across all professions\". \nNational Award-winning costume designer and stylist Niharika Khan also agrees that people are \"willing to experiment\", and that dhoti skirt is a good option. \n\"You can style it with a cape or jacket. You can wear it with a chunni on top and a choli. There's a lot of fun and play you can have and still look feminine in it,\" said Khan, who designed costumes for Yash Raj Films' \"Band Baaja Baaraat\". \nFashion designer Anju Modi believes that nowadays unisex concepts in fashion are gaining ground and dhoti skirts \"too fall in this bracket\". \n\"It is a silhouette that reflects both the traditional and contemporary aesthetics. It's sexy, comfortable ... and I feel that it is the personality that should be better matched to pull off such a strong and standout look,\" added the designer, who has worked on the costumes for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's \"Bajirao Mastani\". \n\"On a lighter note, till now it's all about who is wearing the pants in the house, but it will now also be who is wearing the dhoti,\" she quipped. \nAccording to Modi, any woman with a \"confident demeanour would easily slip into the dhoti skirts, irrespective of the region or the profession\". \nAnaita Shroff Adajania, fashion director, Vogue India, has also given thumbs up to the trend. \n\"It's a fun take on the skirt, works well with a kurta for a light mehendi or lunch. Its streamline silhouette adds length to your look. Add quirky jewellery to keep the boho mood alive,\" suggests Adajania. \nAs the designers have given the green signal to the look, even some young would-be brides are happy to incorporate it in their wedding ceremonies, as indicated by a random survey done by IANS. \nRanjita Singh, 24, said: \"Wearing dupattas can be annoying at times, so a dhoti skirt with a traditional top is fun and goes well with the wedding ceremonies. Maybe not on the wedding day, but on sangeet or mehendi day or pre-wedding parties would be fun.\" \nAnother bride-to-be, Leena Manchanda, 28, said she found Sonam Kapoor's dhoti look in \"Abhi toh party shuru hui hai\" song from \"Khoobsurat\" suitable if someone wanted to make a unique style statement at an event, when all eyes would be on you.
