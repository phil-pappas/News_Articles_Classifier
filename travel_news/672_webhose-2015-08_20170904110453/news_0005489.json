Terry Branstad is unveiling a new mobile app that offers information about Iowa's arts, culture and history destinations. Branstad announced the app Monday at a news conference at the Iowa State Fair. The app provides details on more than 3,500 spots throughout the state's 99 counties. Users can sort the information by category and location, using mapping tools to see what is available in different regions. It offers details on destinations like the American Gothic House, the bridges in Madison County and the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium. Branstad says the app showcases destinations that are \"points of pride\" and will help people learn more about Iowa. The app is available in the Apple and Google Play stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T06:04:16.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
