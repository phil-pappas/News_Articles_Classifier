But even though everything is close to everything else, the roads between can make the journey seem endless. \nState Highway One is mostly a two-lane single carriageway, which means keeping your eyes glued on the road. Not easy when the scenery demands attention at every turn. So I've decided to try New Zealand's rail network. \nI am a train tragic, addicted to the romance of the railways, forever on the hunt for rolling stock that's still rolling. I'll take a train in preference to a car any day. Luckily, Kiwi Rail can get me from Wellington to Auckland on track. \nNew Zealand has three great railway journeys. On the South Island, the Coastal Pacific runs along the Kaikoura coast from Picton to Christchurch, while the TranzAlpine chugs west across the spine of the Southern Alps to Greymouth. The Northern Explorer rides volcanic plains and rushing rivers through the heart of North Island between Auckland and Wellington. Each of them packs an impressive scenic punch. \nThe Rangipo Desert, Tongariro National Park. \nI am to board the Northern Explorer in Wellington for a 7.55am departure. Seat allocation is done on the day and, as I have a coffee at the station cafe \nI watch the small army of sombre commuters marching off to their daily grind. I receive my seat number and brochures about the train and the journey ahead. We leave bang on time. \nThe carriage is pristine and my seat comfy with plenty of leg room. But the \"wow\" factor here centres on the glass windows, which extend into the roof area, letting in shafts of morning sun and offering an uninterrupted view. Ad Feedback \nThere's a buffet car but all meals, including breakfast, can be pre-ordered and served at your seat. Soon, Simone is doing the rounds with trays of good coffee and fresh muffins. \nMost passengers are tourists, but there are a few locals and one or two regular commuters who are greeted by name. Simone has a loud laugh, a good line in chat and she brooks no nonsense. She makes me feel like a little kid travelling with my aunty, which is kind of reassuring. \nAfter barely 30 minutes, we reach the beautiful Kapiti Coast, dominated by the dramatic island that gives it its name. \nA display screen at the front of the carriage tracks our route and indicates points of interest along the way. A small light and a soft \"ping\" sound is the signal for us to put on our headphones for a commentary. \nThe narrative about Maori history, colonial settlement and bicultural nation-building is rich and informative. \nBy morning tea, we're at the city of Palmerston North, the second of seven scheduled stops before Auckland. \nOn the platform, I spot a young musician channelling Philip Marlowe in fedora and overcoat and steering a double bass through the crowd to the luggage car. \nThe Emerald Lakes at Tongariro National Park. \nFrom Palmy, as the locals call it, we begin the most spectacular part of the day's journey, through Tongariro National Park with its three volcanic mountains. On a clear day you can see the fourth volcano, Mount Taranaki, almost 140 kilometres to the west. Today is not such a day but it's certainly clear enough to experience the jaw-dropping beauty of the park's deep-river gorges, rushing with white water and flanked by chalky white cliffs. \nThe train flies over the rivers on a series of spectacularly lofty bridges. They're a crowd-pleaser that gets everyone into the viewing carriage, open to the elements. Hapuawhenua Viaduct is the longest bridge at 414 metres and it curves too, so that, leaning out, I have a direct line of sight to the swirling water 30 metres below. It's a dramatic image, made more so by my knowledge of what once happened here. \nIn December 1953, a lahar – a mass of volcanic mud and debris – plunged down Mount Ruapehu, sweeping away the Tangiwai rail bridge just before the express to Wellington came through. All but the last three carriages plunged into the river, killing 151 people. \nWe've climbed 630 metres over the 50 kilometres that take us to our next stop, National Park Station. That's too steep a gradient for any train, so here the train winds back on itself through a sequence of loops known as the Raurimu Spiral. Built in 1898, it's still one of the world's great engineering feats. \nAt Waitomo, passengers hop off to explore the famous caves before we wend our way through farmland to Hamilton, then towards our destination. Nine hours – and 681 kilometres – later I've not even opened my book. \nAt 6.50pm, we reach Auckland's Britomart Station. No baggage carousels, no traffic-choked taxi rides. \nI wander along the harbourfront to my hotel and a good dinner – a fine way to end the day. \nWHEN TO GO The service operates six days a week. Options include seven- and 14-day passes for hop on/hop off touring. \nWHAT TO EAT AND DRINK The food aboard is plentiful. There are hot meals, salads, soups and snacks. Gluten-free and vegetarian options are available as well as beer and wine. \nWHO CAN TRAVEL The train accommodates disabled passengers. A roomy luggage car makes surfboards, skis – and double basses – no problem. \nWHAT TO WEAR Jacket, scarf and hat – the viewing carriage can get very chilly. \nCOST $219.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:05:44.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
