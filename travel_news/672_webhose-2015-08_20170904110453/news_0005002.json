With this interline ticketing agreement, the tenth such agreement for Silver Airways, travelers can more easily connect between the carriers’ networks. \nUnder the agreement, travelers are now able to purchase a single ticket for flights to and from the more than 50 cities that Avianca serves throughout Central and South America, and to Silver Airways’ destinations throughout Florida and the Bahamas. By booking single ticket trips and combining flights on multiple carriers, customers benefit from one-stop check-in and baggage check when they transfer between the two airlines. \n“Introducing a well-respected and award-winning brand like Avianca to our growing portfolio of trusted airline alliances enables us to seamlessly bring even more popular destinations within reach of customers for both airlines, and gives travelers the opportunity to easily connect between our networks,” said Silver Airways President and CEO Sami Teittinen. \nThis interline relationship brings many exciting Florida, Southeastern U.S. and Bahamian destinations within reach for Avianca customers, including Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Key West, Charleston, Bimini, Grand Bahama (Freeport), North Eleuthera, Governor’s Harbour, the Abacos (Marsh Harbour and Treasure Cay) and Great Exuma (George Town). At the same time, Silver Airways’ customers benefit from easier interline access to colorful and vibrant Avianca destinations throughout Latin America, including Barranquilla, Colombia (BAQ), Cali, Colombia (CLO), San Salvador, El Salvador (SAL), and Panama City, Panama (PTY), among many others. Since emerging as an independent airline just over two years ago, Silver Airways has developed a diverse and growing portfolio of airline alliances that includes codeshare agreements with JetBlue Airways and United Airlines, as well as interline agreements with American Airlines, US Airways, Delta Air Lines, Bahamasair, Alaska Airlines, Hahn Air, and All Nippon Airways. “Our new agreement with Avianca once again demonstrates Silver Airways’ continuing commitment to support our partner airlines’ route networks with expanded intra-Florida and Bahamas flying,” added Teittinen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T13:40:26.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
