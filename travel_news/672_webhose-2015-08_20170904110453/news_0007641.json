From that date applicants will have one month to submit their home-grown ideas to grow the tourism industry.\nThe new process will be for tourism experiences that take place between January 1 and December 31, 2016. The BTA funds entrepreneurs’ ideas for visitor experiences up to $75,000.\nAlso on September 3 rd , the BTA will host a free, voluntary workshop designed to educate potential applicants about creating successful tourism experiences. The workshop, to be held at Elbow Beach Bermuda, is split into a morning session (8:30am-10:30am) and an afternoon session (4:30pm-6:30pm).\nThe same content will be shared at both sessions so applicants should only attend one session. Tourism industry trends and marketing strategies will be among the agenda items covered. The workshop will also walk potential applicants through the online application portal.\nSource:- Bermuda Tourism Authority", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T10:29:46.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
