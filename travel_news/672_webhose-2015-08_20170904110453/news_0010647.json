Those bode well for America, and the bull market should soon resume. \nFaulty accounting standards make dicey assessing the true profitability of most publicly traded Chinese companies. Bond ratings in the Middle Kingdom, often a good first indicator of business health, are outright frauds -- 97% of Chinese companies score AA or AAA, compared with 1.4% for U.S. businesses. \nOnly 39% of Chinese shares are actively traded, with the balance held by government entities or company founders, whereas 94% of U.S. shares are in the active marketplace. \nAs of June 8, the Shanghai Composite index was up 250% over the prior 12 months, then it plummeted 37% before stabilizing somewhat the end of last week. That respite, however, was accomplished after Beijing again flooded markets with liquidity. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks George Soros Is Buying in 2015 \nRecently, Beijing opened the Shanghai and Hang Seng markets to selected foreign investors, but they have remained shy about jumping in -- and for good reason. Chinese company reports and stock-market valuations are as fraudulent as China's gross-domestic-product statistics. \nThe flood of cheap imports at Wal-Mart ( WMT ) and size of China's official U.S. dollar holdings testify to the heft of its economy. Official measures of GDP and growth are inflated and don't jibe with indicators economists use to measure economies with dodgy statistics such as freight shipments, passenger travel, electricity use and property development. \nBeijing reported 7% growth for the second quarter, but actual growth was about half that. If the money-losing \"zombie factories,\" propped up by government bank loans, were shuttered, the pace would be even lower. \nChina's economic strategy of yuan devaluation, government bank lending to favored enterprises and compelling western companies to transfer know-how to gain market access is running out of gas, much like in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T20:01:48.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
