Situated about 38 kms away from Nashik, Trimbakeshwar is the origin point of the river Godavari. The Sinhasta Kumbh Mela is held once in 12 years. The Kumbh Mela rotates among the four holy sites every three years. Millions of devotees plunge into the holy River Godavari that is believed to cleanse their souls leading to salvation. Legend has it: During the fierce fight to grab hold of the pot, some drops of elixir from the kumbh fell at four places — Allahabad, Haridwar, Ujjain, and Nashik. These are the four spots where the Kumbh Mela is celebrated in rotation.
