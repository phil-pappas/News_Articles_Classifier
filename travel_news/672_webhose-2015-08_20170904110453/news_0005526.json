Here’s how to spot which companies’ dividends are safe and which may be on the chopping block. Know your dividends Dividends are paid to investors for the risk they take in buying the shares. When an investor pays cash for shares in a company, the firm uses those funds to manage the business and generate profits. It will pay out a portion of the profits every year by way of compensation. The dividend payments ultimately rise and fall in line with the profits. That said, over the shorter term it is the amount of cash a company generates that has the biggest direct influence on dividend payments. The mining sector may be far less profitable in a lower commodity price environment. But some companies can still support the dividend payments as they are generating plenty of cash. Low cost producers Big mining companies have spent billions to meet Chinese demand. The problem is that the Chinese economy is now slowing and no longer needs as many raw materials. The price of iron ore has collapsed from $140 per ton in January 2014, to about $56 yesterday. Using BHP Billiton as an example, the $21.7bn in pre-tax profits reported last year are expected to fall to $12.6bn this year, and $8.4bn in 2016. That pre-tax profit figure is an accounting measure and includes costs such as writing down the value of mine assets and an estimate for the costs of ageing mine equipment. BHP can still generate plenty of cash from selling iron ore at these lower prices after years of investment to become more efficient than higher cost producers. Miners are still able to generate plenty of cash at these lower prices Analysts from Investec estimate that in the full-year BHP will generate $17.8bn in cash after paying interest and tax, and that would cover the $6.6bn in dividend payments 2.7 times. Even next year BHP should generate what is called “free” cash of $12bn. Slashing spending There is still the thorny issue of spending on new projects. The mining industry is like an oil tanker, it takes a long time to turn around; decisions taken years ago to build new mining capacity cannot just be stopped. What’s more, it doesn’t make sense to stop a project that is 90pc complete just because it won’t be as profitable at current prices as it could still make plenty of cash. The industry is therefore cutting back any projects that will only be profitable and generate cash at above $55 per ton. BHP spent $15.6bn on new projects last year, and that is forecast to fall to $12.6bn in the year to June 2015, and $9bn next year. There is always the option of tightening its belt further to protect dividends. Balance sheet strength The strength of the balance sheet is also a key measure in determining how secure dividend payments are. The stronger the balance sheet the more room a company has to negotiate borrowing from the banks. This greater flexibility around funding gives it more time to make decisions about capital spending, dividends and borrowing, and while not sustainable in the long term, increased borrowing can be used to pay dividends. If a company already has high levels of borrowing then, when profits fall sharply, there is no option but to take the knife to dividends. Using BHP as the example again, the balance sheet at the half-year to the end of December showed total assets of $146bn, and total liabilities of $59.8bn, giving net assets of $86.2bn. Importantly there are some other claims on BHP’s assets so the net assets available to shareholders was $79.8bn. The net debt – or total debts less the cash on the balance sheet – was $24.9bn at the end of December. A measure of risk to shareholders is the ratio of net debt to the net assets, or what is also known as leverage, of 31pc. What that figure also indicates is that if BHP stopped trading today and paid back all its creditors then shareholders would get roughly 69pc of the net asset value per share. Running the numbers Pulling it all together, we can take a look at which of the big FTSE miners have the most sustainable dividend policies. Miners’ dividends are highly attractive with prospective yields of 6.6pc for BHP, 5.6pc for Rio Tinto, 6.7pc for Anglo American and 6pc for Glencore. Based on estimates for the coming financial year from broker Investec, BHP should generate about $17.8bn in free cash flow to cover a dividend of $6.6bn. Rio Tinto has free cash of $6.2bn and a dividend of $4.2bn.Glencore has free cash of $6.5bn and a dividend of $2.4bn. Anglo American has negative free cash flow of $1.2bn and a dividend of $1.6bn. The balance sheet ratio of net debt to shareholders’ equity where the higher number equates to more risk for investors is 31pc for BHP, 30pc for Rio Tinto, 87pc for Glencore, and 61pc for Anglo American. Looking ahead BHP, which has results on August 26, and Rio should be able to muddle through the next 12 months. But Anglo and Glencore are coming under increasing pressure to cut their cloth accordingly. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph The Telegraph Investor £10 to trade shares and no charge to buy & sell funds Find out more »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:01:26.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
