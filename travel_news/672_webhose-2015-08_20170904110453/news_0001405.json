He will be sharing his northern Thai recipes with city and Hotel guests alike for the next three months. Guests can enjoy Chef Suwattana’s dishes at Asia Restaurant every day for lunch and dinner. For a novel way to learn even more about one of the world’s favourite cuisines, he will be providing interactive private cooking classes for Hotel guests and diners to witness the creation of his northern Thai cuisine first hand.\nChef Suwattana stated, “Each region in Thailand is famous for its own cooking style and I think that is interesting because we are actually using almost the same ingredients but just a little twist can make the taste different. I’m really looking forward to sharing my twists and tastes of northern Thai cuisine with our Hotel and city guests.”\nAsia is located on the first floor of the Hotel in Amman and sets a new standard of quality and excellence as one of the Kingdom’s specialised Thai restaurants. In addition to contemporary Thai, Four Seasons Hotel Amman has created imaginative and acclaimed restaurants to cater to a variety of tastes, including Levant cuisine at Olea, classic Italian cuisine at Vivace, light fare at The Foyer Lounge, the intimate Square Bar, and the inviting outdoor ambiance of FIVE Grill & Lounge, which is open in the summer.\nSource:-Four Seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:15:29.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
