Ahead, the Appalachian Mountains roll into North Carolina's Piedmont and the coast, the entire trip without vehicle support. The Trans-America odyssey, appropriately labeled Bike Loud! is slated to end on August 18 with a ceremony and a celebration at Blockade Runner Beach Resort in Wrightsville Beach . As the trip began in Oregon , it will close with a synchronized dip of bicycle wheels into the ocean. The public is invited to attend. \"I'm excited to bike across the country because it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to challenge myself in a unique way,\" said biker Max Morgan . \"I'm also really glad that we will be raising awareness across the country for the Be Loud! Sophie Foundation.\" Sophie Steiner , diagnosed with germ-cell cancer in November 2012 , died nine months later at age 15. Before her passing, Sophie expressed a strong desire to help other teens facing an overwhelming cancer diagnosis with non-clinical needs. Sophie's wish led to the creation of the Be Loud! Sophie Foundation, which supports teen cancer programs at UNC Hospitals. The Boy Scouts have seen many acts of kindness and generosity on their journey, including meals, overnight accommodations, refreshing swimming pools and contributions to the Be Loud! Sophie Foundation. \"This is the generosity we continuously encounter,\" said biker Andrew de Figueiredo .
