Engineers have carried out work on this area and have approved its return to service.\nAurigny say the certification to fly is only achieved after a detailed evaluation to ensure it is entirely safe.\nFurther work, to carry out a permanent repair, will be undertaken next week.\nThe flight will leave London Gatwick at 7pm.\nAurigny say because of the extremely wet weather, coupled with the length of Guernsey’s runway, they have taken the decision, where necessary, to leave bags behind.\nThey say they hope to get all our passengers’ luggage back to Guernsey by tomorrow, with a fair proportion arriving tonight. Passengers will be contacted by Aurigny as their bags arrive and we ask that they wait until they are contacted by us.\nLast updated Fri 14 Aug 2015 Travel Guernsey Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:53:06.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
