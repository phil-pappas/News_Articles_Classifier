It offers a well-maintained network of mountain trails, golf, excellent restaurants, swimming beaches, and a full service resort. A hiker along a well-maintained foot path along the Coloane Trail. The Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \n\nAs Macau's largest land mass, Coloane offers a side of the enclave that many visitors are not aware of. There is a stylish resort, 2 swimming beaches, 2 pubic swimming pools, a golf course, and an excellent network of well maintained hiking trails. \nMost important,there are NO CASINOS!!! \nMost visitors to Macau spend only a few hours - either tempting Lady Luck at the casinos or trekking through the historic neighborhoods of the Old City. \nThey purchase a few cookies or dried meats, have a picture of themselves taken in front the the Ruins of St. Paul's, have dinner at a Portuguese restaurant, and catch the next jetfoil or bus back home. \nBetter to spend the night. Better yet to spend 2 nights and take full advantage of everything that Macau has to offer. \nThis is the first in a 4 part series of suggested itineraries for a 3 day, 2 night stay spanning roughly 44 hours. \nI conceived of these as long weekends (leaving work early on Friday and returning home on Sunday). \nHowever, if you want to escape the maddening crowds, a mid-week get-away would be even better! \nAnd if you can't leave work early on day one, just skip the afternoon's activities and head straight to \"evening\". DAY ONE The view of Hac Sa Beach from the roof of the Grand Coloane Resort in Macau. Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. Afternoon \nCheck into the Grand Coloane Resort, freshen up, and enjoy the facilities. The hotel has a lovely swimming pool and a well-equipped gym. \nThere is a spa, but if you want a treatment, make sure to reserve a day in advance. There are mountain bikes for rent if you'd like to take a spin through the 'hood. \nAlternatively ... \nCheck into the Pousada de Coloane, a boutique hotel with 27 rooms overlooking Cheoc-Van Beach. A beach, a swimming pool, and an excellent Italian restaurant are within walking distance of the hotel. Or why not go for a walk? Evening \nHead to Fernando's, one of Macau's oldest and most popular Portuguese eateries, which is situated at the other end of Hac Sa Beach. \nStart with sangria on the terrace. Move indoors and indulge yourself with the grilled meats, poultry, and seafood. The clams and squid are highly recommended. \nThis place is mentioned in all of the guidebooks. More important is the word of mouth among Hong Kong expatriates. But it is one place that really DOES live up to all the hype. But I'm talking food, not service ... \nAlternatively ... \nHave dinner at Miramar. It is within walking distance of the Grand Coloane Resort. There are lots of families. The ambiance is VERY Portuguese. \nIt's a bit pricey, and very few tourists seem to have heard of the place. Some people would call that a plus! \nDAY TWO Tam Sing Temple, a Buddhist Temple on a hilltop in Coloane, MacauPhoto Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. Morning \nEnjoy a leisurely buffet breakfast at the Panorama Cafe (if you stay at the Grand Coloane Resort) or have breakfast on the terrace (if you are staying at the Pousada de Coloane). \nWalk from the hotel to Hac Sa Reservoir. Continue along the Coloane Trail to the Tam Sing Temple and the Statue of the Goddess of Mercy. \nThe hotel offers scheduled guided walks 3 days a weeks, which are free to hotel guests. \nNon-guests are charged 200 MOP. Make sure to sign up in advance. Walks can also be arranged at other times if there is sufficient demand. \nAlternatively ... \nGet a map and trek on your own or rent bicycles and explore the wilds of Coloane on your own. \nAnother option is to take a bus or a taxi to the foot of the hill and catch the free shuttle bus, which leaves every 30 minutes, to the temple and trek your way down. Noon \nAfter freshening up, enjoy a mouth-watering dim sum lunch at the Grand Coloane's Kwun Hoi Heen Chinese Restaurant. \nAlternatively ... \nCatch a bus or a taxi (or hoof it if you've got the stamina, the weather isn't too hot, and the dogs don't intimidate you) to Coloane Village and have lunch at Lord Stow's Cafe (a Macanese icon). \nPlease note: this place has been written up in all the guide books, it is very small, and there is often a line. Why not be adventurous, stroll about the village, and try a place a bit more off the beaten track? Afternoon \nIf you are staying at the Grand Coloane, spend the afternoon at the hotel's lovely swimming pool, work out at the fitness centre, have a spa treatment, and/or or play a round of golf at the Macau Golf and Country Club, which adjoins the hotel. \nPlease note: hotel guests have access to the course, but must pay a fee to use the facilities. Non-guests can get day passes to use the hotel's swimming pool and other facilities but not the golf course. \nAlternatively ... \nIf you want to rub shoulders with the locals (or if you are not staying at the Grand Coloane), spend the afternoon at one of Coloane's two beaches. \nHac Sa Beach is within walking distance of the hotel - or, if it's too hot (or the dogs frighten you) take a bus or a taxi. \nIf you opt for Seac Van Beach, you'll have to catch a taxi, unless you are staying at the Pousada de Coloane, in which case it is just a few steps from the hotel. \nIf the muddy waters put you off (rest assured, they might be beige, but they are not polluted), both beaches have excellent and very well maintained public swimming pools. Evening \nHead to nearby Chec Van Beach, where a mouth-watering Italian dinner awaits at La Gondola, which serves great salads, seafood, pizza, and pasta. \nAlternatively ... \nCatch a taxi to Coloane Village and have dinner at one of the open-air restaurants that line the square along the waterfront in front of the Chapel of Saint Francis Xavier. \nDAY THREE Michael Taylor at the entrance to Seac Van Park, home of the Giant Panda Pavilion on Coloane, Macau. Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. Morning \nEnjoy a leisurely breakfast at your hotel (whichever one you choose) and enjoy the facilities until lunch. \nAsk for a late check out if you are not in a hurry. If you're lucky, your room might not have been booked. But there are no guarantees. Worst case scenario: you leave your stuff with the concierge. Noon \nThe hamburgers at the Panorama Cafe at the Grand Coloane Resort are HIGHLY recommended. Why not have one by the swimming pool. Salads are also on offer. \nAlternatively ... \nHave lunch at the Grand Coloane's Kwun Hoi Heen Chinese Restaurant, the Miramar, Fernando's, or one of the eateries that dot Coloane Village. Afternoon \nAll good things must end. If you have time, stop off at the Seac Pai Van Park on your way to the jetfoil and say \"Hi!\" to the giant panda, which occupies a giant pavilion. \nPlease note: check the schedule ahead of time. Admission to the pavilion is only 10 MOP (free for children and senior citizens), but visitation is limited to certain time slots. \nAlternatively ... \nWhy call in sick and spend another day? \nWhere Partial view of the swimming pool at the Grand Coloane Resort in Macau.
