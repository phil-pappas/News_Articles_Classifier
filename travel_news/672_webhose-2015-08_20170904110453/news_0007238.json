In Sydney for the bureau’s fifth International Advisory Board (IAB) Forum, nine board members and one international media representative were treated to the industry’s first behind-the-scenes look at the A$1.5 billion development. \nJoining the first international site tour, Mr Rod Cameron, Executive Director of the Joint Meetings Industry Council said, “ICC Sydney has been designed with the future of meetings in mind. The way people interact is changing – we’ve seen rapid evolution in recent years and technology and generational behavior will continue to revolutionise business events.” “Having just stepped off the site tour, I can honestly say, this is a building that will be responding very effectively to those challenges. My appetite has been whet. I can’t wait to see it open next year.” With just over 12 months until the much-anticipated ICC Sydney will be ready to open its doors to major international business events, BESydney CEO Lyn Lewis-Smith said the special preview provided the bureau’s guests with exclusive insights into what will be Australia’s premier meeting precinct. “Sydney is building for the future. Next year, the city will be home to new world-class convention and exhibition facilities. Already, we’ve secured more than 20 events for ICC Sydney and interest remains strong. Together with the multi-billion dollar program of reinvention and transformation across the city, including at Barangaroo and the Bays Precinct, Sydney will be where the world wants to meet. ICC Sydney CEO Geoff Donaghy said he was delighted to show the distinguished group of key industry leaders and influencers how the venue was taking shape and how its integrated design would deliver a paradigm shift in the way that business events were delivered in the global city of Sydney. “ICC Sydney delivers increased convention and exhibition capability and flexibility fitting of an international city like Sydney, however it’s the integrated design that is an absolute game-changer for delivering business events on the world stage in this city. “Our ability to hold a number of consecutive events, including three concurrent large conventions, and an arrival of a contemporary 8,000-seat theatre that would double as an entertainment venue, adds to the dynamism and interactivity of the entire precinct. The way its design blends with the local environment further enhances its vitality by allowing visitors to experience Sydney like never before. Large glass facades, balconies and open air facilities provide fantastic views over the precinct, city skyline and harbour. It also allows Sydney to look back at ICC Sydney and be proud of the important events that will take place within,” Mr Donaghy said. The tour of ICC Sydney capped off a memorable start to the week, which began with a tour of the city’s major renewal projects and city landmarks followed by a welcome lunch with Jonathan O’Dea, NSW Parliamentary Secretary for Major Events and Tourism. Mr O’Dea reinforced the importance of business events to the government’s economic development agenda and its role in boosting the Sydney’s global profile as a smart place for business. “We are focused on the future, we have a plan and we are delivering on it,” said Mr O’Dea. “International engagement is a key pillar of our growth strategy and will underpin a bigger and brighter future for Sydney and New South Wales. Business events play an important role as a connector between global professionals, governments and academics. “Our success relies on close collaboration with organisations such as Business Events Sydney and we look forward to strengthening our partnership to help deliver real benefits to our respective communities.” Business Events Sydney’s IAB members are in Sydney until Friday, 21 August 2015 participating in a week-long program of in-depth briefings and discussions with the bureau and key partners ahead of the opening of ICC Sydney in December 2016.
