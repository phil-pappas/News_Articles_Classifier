I am also happy that you are providing youth programmers that will propel Ugandans onto the international stage,” President Museveni said. \nKluivert and Garcia said they will establish a youth soccer development academy in Uganda, having identified a lot of talent within the country. \n“I have been here three weeks and I have seen with my own eyes that Uganda has a lot of soccer talent here. There are many young people with great potential to make it on the world stage. We want to give them this opportunity,” Garcia said. \nKluivert, who flew in on Sunday night, said he was overwhelmed by Uganda’s beauty and tourism potential. \n“In the short time I have been here, I have no doubt that Uganda is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. We will give you good global coverage for both tourism and investment, because you have a lot to offer,” Kluivert said. \nThe duo is here on a mission that includes UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador activities, as well as the identification of soccer talent in Uganda for promotion abroad, and the identification of opportunities to promote tourism and investment in Uganda using the Barcelona FC brand. \nBarcelona FC is the second most valuable sports team in the world, worth US$3.2 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €484.6 million. \nIt is a highly popular club with millions of fans around the world. \nThe duo was, accompanied by Tourism Minister Maria Mutagamba, Uganda Tourism Board Member Amos Wekesa, Uganda Tourism Board Chief Executive Stephen Asiimwe, and Uganda Wildlife Authority Executive Director Dr. Andrew Seguya.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T23:08:08.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
