Difficile vaccine candidate now completed - results expected at the end of 2015 . Outlook: Following the Company's decision to take direct control of IXIARO ® 's marketing and distribution, Valneva expects 2015 overall IFRS revenues and grants to reach the lower end of its previous guidance range of EUR 75 to 85 million due to the short-term transition impact. The Company expects to fully make up for this short-term adverse financial impact already in 2016 with a significant improvement in the revenues and profitability of its Japanese encephalitis vaccine. Valneva will continue to report a loss in 2015in order to support its strategy of focused spending in research and development and to create long-term value through innovation. Financial results in the 2015 second half will be marked by the integration of the recently acquired DUKORAL ® and Nordics trade business and the transition of the marketing and distribution of the Company's key value generator IXIARO ® , setting the base for moving towards break-even following the transitional period in 2015. Thomas Lingelbach, President and Chief Executive Officer and Franck Grimaud, Deputy CEO of Valneva, commented, \"In the first half, Valneva has delivered on its strategy to become a fully integrated vaccine biotech company by acquiring a second commercial vaccine and taking direct control of the marketing and distribution of its products. Following a transitional period in the second half of 2015, we foresee a significant increase in the revenues and profitability of our Japanese encephalitis vaccine and expect our DUKORAL ® vaccine to become profitable. We also look forward to the phase II results of our Clostridium difficile vaccine candidate at the end of 2015, the phase II/III results of our Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine candidate in 2016 and the launch of the phase I clinical trial for our Lyme Borreliosis vaccine candidate next year.\" LYON, France, Aug. 31, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- European biotechnology company Valneva SE (\"Valneva\" or \"the Company\") reports today its consolidated financial results for the first half year ended June 30, 2015.
