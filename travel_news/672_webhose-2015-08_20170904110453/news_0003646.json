Comment Posted Aug. 7, 2015 at 5:00 AM There are the sidewalks that end abruptly on a road-shoulder of bare grass. There’s the crosswalk that was removed, making it necessary to carry the bike across guardrails along the highway to reach the paved bike path. And there’s the death-defying lack of a shoulder on the North-South Arterial bridge from North Utica back downtown on return from weekend rides to Old Forge. These are examples of why Wendy Sanders of New Hartford, otherwise an enthusiastic bicycle rider and frequent walker, finds fault with the Utica area’s friendliness to cyclists and pedestrians. “I think it’s so not-friendly that I believe that’s one of the reasons why young people have no interest in being here, ’cause you can’t get around,” she said. By later this summer, the town of New Hartford expects to be done with its 1.2-mile extension of the Rayhill Memorial Recreational Trail. That stretch joins the existing trail, from Halsey Road in Whitestown to New Hartford Road near the Ramada Inn and near the southern city limits. It joins a respectable roster of dedicated multi-use bicycle and pedestrian trails in the Mohawk Valley. That includes the Chenango Canal Towpath Trail in Kirkland, the Black River Canal Path near Boonville, and sizeable portions of the jewel bike path of Upstate New York, the Erie Canalway Trail. But they don’t get people around from place to place. As Sanders noted, to get to the Rayhill Trail, she has to drive. It’s not just convenience, though. Advocates see infrastructure for non-car transportation as part of Utica transforming itself or an expected influx of jobs in the nanotechnology industry at a complex in Marcy and workers to fill them. The region is not rich in marked, signed bike routes, traffic-calmed streets, and foot and bicycle crossings of busy, high-speed expressway style highways such as the North-South arterial. “You’ve got to create the quality of life that the people that you’re looking to attract are looking for,” said Matthew VanSlyke, a former transportation planner and current executive director of Utica Bike Rescue, which gives away free rehabbed bicycles to people who learn maintenance, repair and safety. “People are not looking for a suburban town where everything is automobile oriented,” he said. “People are looking for urban environments that are comfortable and walkable and bikeable, and have culture and have good restaurants and good events and places to go. “We have all of the pieces for that in Utica. We just have to pull them all together. I think the bicycling and the bicycle friendliness are really an important piece of that quality of life that we have to create.” Page 2 of 2 - A bike-and-pedestrian path is being built by the state Department of Transportation as part of the Arterial rebuild. But a link to the Rayhill trail in New Hartford has been shelved indefinitely for lack of funding. “I would say the last 10 to 15 years have been really dicey for transportation funding,” said Dana Crisino, director of the Herkimer-Oneida Transportation Study, the entity that oversees most transportation planning for the two counties. The good news, however, is that the link still is in the long-term plans, increasing the chances it would be built if funding comes along, such as part of a bigger transportation project. Meanwhile, cyclists play up the positives. Sanders praises the region’s wide rural roads with broad shoulders. VanSlyke finds less-busy routes, such as Sunset Avenue instead of Genesee Street. He noted that Utica is relatively compact so that you can get almost anywhere within a half-hour on a bike. It’ll take public advocacy to get funding for dedicated trails, but the more immediate need is basic infrastructure to support biking, such as lanes and parking and racks that help promote cycling and walking as viable transportation, he said. “That whole trail network is going to take some public support and some advocacy and some initiative by local decision makers to kind of recognize it as the priority, and until that happens it is probably unlikely that the money is just going to magically appear,” VanSlyke said. “That’s not really the way it works, you know.” Follow @OD_Hill on Twitter or call 792-5037.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:20:42.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
