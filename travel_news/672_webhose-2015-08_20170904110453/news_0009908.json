Andrew Cuomo proposes that LaGuardia International Airport be replaced completely.… more The planned renovation of LaGuardia Airport already features a series of upgraded amenities and transportation improvements, and officials have suggested it could be done within a five-year period with a starting cost of $4 billion. However, as Joe Brancatelli wrote for his Seat 2B column last week, New York City airports have been the subject of grand plans before , plans that ultimately fell through. Moreover, Brancatelli wrote, projects on this grand scale that actually do get done simply don’t come in under budget. Experts cited by the New York Post seem to agree with that assessment , saying that it’s unlikely to be completed in just five years due to the sheer complexity of the undertaking. In addition to working within spaces that are surrounded by water, development, and a highway, renovating LaGuardia will require cooperation from many multiple entities, a process that provides ample opportunity for snags, the Post explained. And all that’s before considering if travelers will even get what they really want. A separate Post story asked a few people traveling through LaGuardia what they wanted to see, and came away with a variety of responses: from a mani-pedi station, to a movie theater, to a full-fledged amusement park (long before it was an airport, the area where LaGuardia sits housed an early 20th Century amusement park). In the end, the terminal could almost certainly be nicer and more welcoming, but there’s likely very little officials can do about LaGuardia’s flight delays, perhaps the most important issue facing the airport. All three of New York’s major area airports, LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Newark, have had poor on-time records recently, and as Wired noted , that’s likely because the Northeast’s airspace is especially crowded. \nWant New York Travel news in your inbox?
