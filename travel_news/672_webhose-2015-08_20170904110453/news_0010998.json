There are 22 amazing pools to enjoy. Some are “adults only,” offering sun-soaked serenity, while others provide a riot of activity. No longer just for swimming, today’s pools provide a high entertainment factor that keeps guests lingering for hours. \nLeading the trend are high-end inflatables, lounges and beanbags, where adult and teen guests can bob and float to their hearts’ delight. \nAt the Sheraton Waikiki, adults are drawn to the spectacular Infinity Edge Pool, which recently was named one of the top 10 hotel pools in USA Today’s Readers’ Choice Awards. The heated oceanfront infinity pool -- one of the longest in North America -- provides stunning views of Waikiki and Diamond Head. Pool goers float for hours on oversized beanbags filled with buoyant foam beads. They also delight in complimentary DVD players with movies, cold water misting throughout the day, oshibori (moist towels), sweet local pineapple and watermelon samplings, and mp3 players with select Hawaiian music. \nAnother reason to linger? The adjacent pool deck offers private cabanas and lounge chairs with large umbrellas providing shade as a way to stay cool throughout the day. \nThe nearby Helumoa Playground, exclusively for guests of the Sheraton Waikiki and The Royal Hawaiian, a Luxury Collection Resort, is another oceanfront oasis where guests can spend the day enjoying two freshwater swimming pools, a 15-foot high by 70-foot-long water slide and two large whirlpools, all with sweeping views of Waikiki Beach. There also is an interactive fountain area for kids, fun and creative food and beverages, 10 cabanas, chaise water sunning benches, and a pool hut where guests may purchase inflatable flotation devices and pool toys. \nAt night, the Helumoa pool serves as a canvas for the world’s first 3D pool mapping light show, featuring two unique shows nightly. One story showcases lava flowing from erupting volcanoes depicting the creation of the Hawaiian Islands and the other illustrates the early days of Waikiki including the ancient Hawaiian sport of surfing. \nFor those seeking secluded relaxation in a luxurious setting, the Malulani Pool at The Royal Hawaiian, a Luxury Collection Resort is the ultimate solution. The resort’s intimate adults-only pool area allows guests to reserve private cabanas and sunshade-equipped chaises for a daily fee. Offering a quiet oasis fronting the world-famous Waikiki Beach and Pacific Ocean, the comfortable lounges feature plush pink cushions, oversized pillows, deck umbrellas and a wait-staff providing food and beverage service. \nOn the Valley Isle, the pools at The Westin Maui Resort & Spa were voted the best on Maui and among the Top 10 Jaw-Dropping pools worldwide by TripAdvisor readers. The 87,000-square-foot aquatic playground features five swimming pools, two water slides, a swim-through grotto with waterfalls and a hidden whirlpool. The area is surrounded by exotic wildlife. While kids and teens go wild over the resort’s four family-friendly outdoor pools including the 128-foot water slide, couples seeking cozy downtime can unwind at the adults-only pool or reserve pool gazebos with refreshments. \nCommanding the pristine North Kaanapali Beach, The Westin Ka‘anapali Ocean Resort Villas offers six outdoor pools, with two dedicated to children and one for adult serenity. Located in garden-style settings with panoramic ocean views, the pools offer splashing fun to guests of all ages. Children will be especially delighted with the pirate ship pool that is ideally situated by the Westin Kids Club and playground area. \nThe Manta Ray Super Slide & Pool at Sheraton Kona Resort & Spa at Keauhou Bay features a 200-foot-long lava tube waterslide and a 900-square-foot sandy-bottom children’s pool. Unequaled in Hawaii, the multi-level system of pools dramatically nestled along the ocean's lava cliffs includes more than 360,000 gallons of water and a combined surface area of 14,100 square feet. This amazing playground is bordered by interactive fountains that dance in the sunlight, allowing guests of all ages to splash, relax, nap, and enjoy the warm tropical sun and ocean breezes, whether they are looking to swim, soak or slide. \nTwo whirlpool spas are tucked beneath lava rock outcroppings. A river system connects the upper and lower pools, which leads to a waterfall and transitions into the 200-foot waterslide. The sandy-bottomed children's pool area includes a shallow water beach area for gentle play providing hours of family fun. \nSheraton Kauai Resort takes advantage of its premier location and the gentle surf at its doorstep with a multi-level Ocean Pool and whirlpool, sitting just above Poipu Beach and lined with eight private bungalows fully equipped with chaise lounges, Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs and ceiling fans for all-day fun in secluded splendor. The Ocean Pool is just steps away from Sheraton Kauai’s Beach Activities desk offering snorkel rentals, boogie boards and more. At the tranquil garden wing of the resort, the Garden Pool offers quiet relaxation with views of the resort’s koi ponds and lush gardens. \nThe Westin Princeville Ocean Resort Villas offers four refreshing pools, which provide all-day entertainment for guests. The multi-tier main pool provides ample space for play; the keiki pool features a kid-size slide and spouting, interactive honu (turtle) fountains; the Na Pali plunge pool and whirlpool look out to the vast Pacific Ocean (the perfect spot for seasonal whale watching); and the Malie Pool provides quiet rejuvenation to soak in the Kauai sun. Resurfacing and retiling of the resort’s Malie and Na Pali plunge pools were completed in April 2015 and a new pāpa’i (cabana) was added to the Malie pool area. The Main Pool’s refresh was completed in May 2015. \nThis spring, the infinity-edge pool at the St. Regis Princeville Resort made the list of “Hotel Infinity Pools You Will Be Dreaming About Forever” by YahooTravel.com. This spectacular 5,000-square-foot aquatic idyll overlooks beautiful Hanalei Bay and Makana Mountain, known as “Bali Hai” in the movie classic “South Pacific.” Surrounded by lush, tropical gardens, the infinity pool’s stunning glass tile and striking water features embody the ultimate in Island luxury. The resort also features two outdoor Jacuzzis, a children’s pool and a watsu therapy pool. During the summer, a special ritual takes place. Each afternoon a uniformed attendant wearing surf shorts slowly descends the swimming pool steps while carrying a tray of cut fruit, which he offers to bathers, much to the surprise and delight of guests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:12:11.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
