Good day, Philadelphia area. What's on the burner this morning? This event is really hot You might have missed this yesterday but the Franklin Institute, which has had many well-received exhibits over the years, reported that the one currently running is the most popular since 2007. Amazing as it seems, it has nothing to do with Pope Francis. Our always inquisitive reporter Kenneth Hilario taps into the vibe. Win a trip to Rome, courtesy of you-know-who Since it is all pope, all the time, you should plan a trip to Rome to see it for yourself. I hear no one ever confuses the Vatican with a Quaker meeting house. Now maybe you can go to Italy on someone else's dime. One local business and one family will get a free trip to Rome as part of a contest announced Wednesday by papal visit officials. Catholics go for a good game of chance. (You know how Catholics love bingo nights in the church basement.) This should be a no-brainer Gay marriage is legal across the land, and that's a good thing. Gay people can still be discriminated in the workplace in Pennsylvania, and that's a bad thing. Now, the proposed Pennsylvania Fairness Act would modify the state’s current nondiscrimination law, which ensures that all citizens – regardless of race, color, religion, ancestry, age, sex, national origin, disability – can participate in and contribute to the state’s economy. The new language would add protections for citizens of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions. State Rep. Brian Sims of Philadelphia and Democratic mayoral hopeful Jim Kenney are backing the measure. Just to be on the safe side The chances that anybody might be harmed are infinitesimally small but Bimbo Bakeries USA in Horsham is recalling bread from markets. Reports of small pieces of glass found on the outside of bread has led the bakery to voluntarily recall products under six well-known brand names . We honor the minority business leaders of 2015 This evening's a big night for some important players in the region's business realm. Along with presenting sponsor Wells Fargo, we'll be recognizing the Minority Business Leader Award winners in an event at the Crystal Tea Room in the Wanamaker Building. There are a lot of unsung heroes. The winners are prime examples of exemplary service to their companies and organizations, the region and their communities. Our compiler of things that can be compiled, Clara Lefton, put together a picture slideshow of the honorees.
