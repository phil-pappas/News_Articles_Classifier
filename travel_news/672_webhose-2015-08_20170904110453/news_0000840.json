One. Size : 55 x 40 x 20cm, for both flight only and package holiday customers. Weight : 5kg. Package holiday customers may be allowed to take up to 7kg on some flights. Thomson says this will be indicated at the booking stage if applicable. Can I book a hold bag on a single leg, and travel hand-luggage only on the other? If you want to make a round trip, Thomson shows baggage charges for a complete two-way trip, and does not give an option for booking a bag for a specific leg. A 20kg checked-in bag is typically charged at £48. Am I allowed any items in addition to my one cabin bag ? Thomson says that \"things like laptops, handbags and items bought at the airport must fit within your one piece of hand baggage\".
