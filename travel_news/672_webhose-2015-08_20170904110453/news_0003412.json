Hotel Central Park through two large steel doors made out of 16,000 twigs. (Photo: Eric Laignel)\n26 CONNECT 19 TWEET 5 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE There are no \"Do Not Disturb\" signs at the new 1 Hotel Central Park. Instead, guests leave stones with the words \"Now\" or \"Not Now\" printed on them outside their doors.\nNightstand notepads are replaced by miniature chalkboards and plastic clothing hangers by cardboard ones. An hourglass alerts guests when they've spent five minutes showering--a suggestion to turn off the faucet.\nThese aren't just whimsical design elements. Each one has a purposeâ€”to help protect the environment. The 1 Hotel chain, the brainchild of legendary hotelier Barry Sternlicht, hopes to take going \"green\" to another level.\n\"I woke up one morning and realized I wanted to leave a different kind of mark on the world,\" Sternlicht says. \"It has been my dream for seven years to establish a retreat that celebrates and protects nature.\"\nThe 1 Hotel brand opens its first hotel in New York City this week. The socially and environmentally-conscious hotel chain, developed by Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group, debuted in Miami earlier this year.\nGoing green is not a new concept for hotels, says Gray Shealy, executive director of the Master's of Hospitality Management Program at Georgetown University.\n1 Hotels, he says, \"aren't the only hotel brand, by any means, to take a stance on the environment ... Almost all hotel groups (luxury included) have some sort of standpoint on sustainability, though they are oftentimes not overly apparent, or overly impactful.\"\nFor instance, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, the company Sternlicht founded and led for many years, has Element, a select-service brand that championed the idea of going green in a holistic way many years ago.\nBut, Shealy says, \"1 Hotels is positioning itself to be the first mainstream luxury brand whose guiding mission and core values are green, ecological sustainability.\"\nUSA TODAY\nWhat's new in New York City this summer\nSternlicht is no stranger to the New York City hotel world. He founded Starwood's W Hotel brand, which has a large presence in New York, and recently developed the luxurious Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan, which he promptly sold to a Chinese insurance company.\nOn a recent preview tour of the I Hotel Central Park, Sternlicht showed off what he's calling one of his most significant accomplishments--a hotel chain that adheres to green building and LEED standards while providing a luxurious experience.\nAs proof of that, the first three stories of the hotel are covered by an ivy exterior green wall. The hotel is also just one block from New York City's largest green space: Central Park.\nGuests enter through two large steel doors made out of 16,000 twigs. The ceiling is made from reclaimed oak from the New York area. Floor numbers are represented by different designs made with such materials as penny nails and acorns.\nThe 229 guest rooms and suites are decorated with furniture made by local craftsmen. Some rooms feature reclaimed wooden timbers and window seats that can be used for sitting or napping.\nThe walk-in showers were designed to look like indoor greenhouses. The bathrooms are made with natural materials such as mushroom wood and reclaimed brick.\nEach room has filters in all taps, sinks and showers and energy-efficient heating and cooling systems.\nUSA TODAY\nA look at IHG's new EVEN wellness hotels\nTo cut down on the use of paper, guests can check in electronically. They can also read newspapers and magazines on a pre-loaded Nexus device in each room. 1 Guide, the hotel's app, lets guests control all features in the room, including the television and temperature.\n\"It is sometimes said that 'green' design and luxury cannot co-exist,\" says Greg Bradshaw, one of the principals at AvroKO, the New York-based design company that worked on the project. \"We were excited to take on that stereotype and attempt to disrupt the thinking about environmentally-conscious venues.\"\nGuests have access to Tesla premium electric vehicle rides within a 15-block radius, complimentary valet for all electric vehicles for overnight guests, and complimentary bicycle valet parking. Wi-Fi is free for up to five devices.\nThe hotel encourages guests to stay physically fit with 24-hour access to the Field House, which has a floor reclaimed from the University of Wisconsin basketball court. Rooms have yoga mats and programming. Guests will also be able to take personal training in Central Park with Spartan Fitness.\nThe food and beverage program is run by celebrity chef Jonathan Waxman. His 100-seat restaurant Jams serves local and seasonal cuisine using organic ingredients.\nWhen guests check in, they get goodie bags filled with snacks curated by Waxman.\n\"Of course travelers will always want the ultimate in experiences and services,\" Sternlicht says, \"and I believe we can deliver that in a modern, responsible way that feels natural, organic and connected with the local environment.\"\n26 CONNECT 19 TWEET 5 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1SNwFqk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links":
