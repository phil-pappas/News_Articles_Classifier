Some will boast about getting into institutions of excellence and prestige, while others humbly appreciate the great research facilities and graduate prospects offered by British universities . But none of them should celebrate their entry to a university with a high \"student satisfaction\" ranking, because, quite frankly, they are pointless. To be fair, I would be lying if I said that the student satisfaction ranking was a huge factor for anyone when picking universities. But it’s depressing to see how institutions exploit the ranking, before and especially after the big day. During the times of despair for pupils who haven’t achieved their hopes, universities use this PR ranking to lure them into enrolling through the clearing process as if it’s the last and the best option available, even though all respectable and well-known universities offer clearing places as well. Adverts pop up on the internet, buses, tube, dreams and nightmares claiming that more than 90 per cent of students are satisfied with the university and that’s why you should apply. An already stressed student then wonders whether that university isn’t a secret jewel of British education. \"WE'RE JUST SO SATISFIED\" Photo: Caters The problem is that there’s no link between a high satisfaction rating and the actual quality of education. The contrary appears to be true, as worse universities tend to disproportionately excel at satisfaction. If we take, for instance, the top 35 “happy” universities , exclude medical and art schools (as they aren’t subjected to standard league tables) and compare them to the general top 35 , we find that two thirds of those on the former list aren't actually on the latter. A quarter of them aren't even in the top 50. This comes down to the fact that better universities attract a greater number of talented people with higher expectations, while courses tend to be as challenging as amusing. Studying at Oxbridge, there’s hardly much time for fun blokes’ night outs as deadlines for coursework are constantly looming. At the same time, however, top universities portray themselves as academic powerhouses, which then fosters students’ expectation of studying at “Eton for adults.” The realisation that it’s far from that imaginary elitist intellectual incubator leads to diminishing overall satisfaction. Similarly, the pressure nowadays to go to university straight after school leads to extremely intelligent people ending up in the courses they don’t particularly enjoy, even though it makes sense career-wise to pursue them. In such case, the questions asked by the national student survey about passionate lecturers making the subject exciting lose its purpose because this doesn’t really assess the value of the university. \"But I totally trusted those ratings!\" Photo: PA Perhaps the biggest problem facing the student satisfaction rating, though, is our natural affinity towards things we have chosen, also known as choice-supportive bias. Almost tribal support among students of their respective universities is nothing new. They could be very critical about the institution in private circles, but once it comes to official standing and reputation of their chosen university, they will defend it fiercely. For that reason, we can’t possibly expect students to objectively evaluate the only university they have attended so far, especially not one for which they are paying £9,000 per year. It’s easy to spot this in the satisfaction rankings, as even the lowest-scoring universities still have an 85 per cent satisfaction rate. Of course you could argue that perhaps most students really are happy with their institutions. I would agree. Britain, after all, has a record number of people applying to universities . That wouldn’t be possible if higher education didn’t offer something better than most countries – and student satisfaction just proves that British education system works. But this argument defeats the purpose of classification, which is to separate the good bunch from the bad. In other words, if the idea behind the survey is to analyse the overall attitude of students, there’s no reason to compare the universities to each other. These rankings aren't just a harmless creation that has no consequences. It feeds into most most overall league tables, inflating the standing of some institutions. That makes it a powerful yet deceptive PR tool for universities. It’s high time to acknowledge how full of hot air it is. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:54:37.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
