Clarifying the historical events about who actually discovered Melbourne, was it really John Pascoe Fawkner or John Batman?\nMelbourne was in fact founded by the passengers and crew of Fawkner’s Enterprize, who sailed from Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania) to a landing place now known as Enterprize Park. They landed on the north bank of the Yarra River where the Kulin nation gathered for ceremonies and cultural activities. Melbourne Day acknowledges these people as the traditional land owners.\nMelburnians can enjoy a range of activities that Melbourne Day has to offer, including the official Flag Raising Ceremony on the morning of Sunday August 30, 2015 at Enterprize Park, followed by a FREE Melbourne Day concert at the Docklands starring Melbourne born, Aussie music legends – Daryl Braithwaite and Russell Morris- Plus a host of other Melbourne musical acts and local entertainment for all age groups -from young kids to mum and dads, even grandparents. The day will include live entertainment, a market of food stalls, trendy food trucks and a raft of activities for the entire family- throughout the Docklands precinct.\nMelburnian’s will also have the chance to view the remarkable Melbourne Regatta – which celebrates Melbourne’s rich history as a thriving port – recognising its maritime culture and rich maritime heritage. Amongst a host of water-based activities on the day – there is a special “Blessing of the Fleet” together with a sail past of a large ‘flotilla’ of vessels, comprising all manner of craft from commercial to privately operated vessels. Heading the fleet will be the Enterprize a replica of the ship that sailed from Tasmania in 1835 with the first permanent white settlers that started what has become the city of Melbourne.​\nFor the younger Melburnians, Melbourne day is also dedicated to educating our young Melburnians aged 10–13 years giving them the opportunity to become the Junior Lord Mayor of Melbourne throughout July and August. The lucky winner will get to raise the city of Melbourne flag and engage a range of junior mayoral duties throughout the year.\nThere will also be a drawing competition involving all primary school children across Victoria to draw icons of the city of Melbourne, and the best line drawing will be appear on the front cover of the 2015 City of Melbourne Birthday card and hat.\nSo come and support every great about our city as it is now up to us to tell the story in the next stage of this historical event!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:04:50.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
