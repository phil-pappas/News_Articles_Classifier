Five hours later, a quadcopter whizzed underneath an Allegiant Air flight as it approached the same runway. Elsewhere in California, pilots of light aircraft reported narrowly dodging drones in San Jose and La Verne. \nIn Washington, a Cessna pilot reported a drone cruising at 1,500 feet in highly restricted airspace over the nation’s capital, forcing the U.S. military to scramble fighter jets as a precaution. In Louisville, a silver-and-white drone almost collided with a training aircraft. In Chicago, United Airlines Flight 970 reported seeing a drone pass by at an altitude of 3,500 feet. \nAll told, 12 episodes were recorded Sunday of small drones interfering with airplanes or coming too close to airports, including other incidents in New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, Florida and North Carolina, according to previously undisclosed reports filed with the Federal Aviation Administration. \nBefore last year, close encounters with rogue drones were unheard of. But as a result of a sales boom, small, largely unregulated remote-control aircraft are clogging U.S. airspace, snarling air traffic and giving the FAA fits. \nPilots have reported a surge in close calls with drones: nearly 700 incidents so far this year, according to FAA statistics, about triple the number recorded for all of 2014. The agency has acknowledged growing concern about the problem and its inability to do much to tame it. \nSo far, the FAA has kept basic details of most of this year’s incidents under wraps, declining to release reports that are ordinarily public records and that would spotlight where and when the close calls occurred. \nThe Washington Post obtained several hundred of the rogue-drone reports from a government official who objected to the FAA’s secrecy. Laura Brown, an FAA spokeswoman, declined to comment on the reports obtained by The Post. \nThe documents show that remote-control planes are penetrating some of the most guarded airspace in the country. \nDrones have also continued to pose a headache for Secret Service agents seeking to protect the president, according to the FAA incident reports. \nOn March 29, the Secret Service reported that a rogue drone was hovering near a West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course where President Obama was hitting the links. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary confirmed the incident. He declined to provide further details but said the Secret Service “has procedures and protocols in place to address these situations when they occur.” \nTwo weeks later, just after noon on April 13, authorities received a report of a white drone flying in the vicinity of the White House. Military aircraft scrambled to intercept the drone, which was last seen soaring near the Tidal Basin on the Mall, heading toward Arlington, according to the FAA reports. \nBoth episodes occurred after a widely reported scare in January, when a small quadcopter drone crashed on the White House grounds , briefly triggering a lockdown and reinforcing concerns about security at the executive mansion. \nMilitary aircraft flying near U.S. bases or in restricted areas reported close calls with drones on at least a dozen occasions this year, according to the FAA documents. \nOn July 10, the pilot of an Air Force F-15 Strike Eagle said a small drone came within 50 feet of the fighter jet. Two weeks later, the pilot of a Navy T-45 Goshawk flying near Yuma, Ariz., reported that a drone buzzed 100 feet underneath the trainer aircraft. \nDespite a nationwide prohibition against small drones flying within five miles of airports or above 400 feet, the documents show that the robotic aircraft have become pervasive intruders, hovering dangerously near runways and in the midst of busy air-traffic corridors. \nPilots are also spotting the small drones at altitudes previously unheard of — sometimes higher than 10,000 feet. \nThe FAA reports are brief and preliminary in nature. In some cases, follow-up investigations determined that small objects pilots had assumed to be drones turned out to be something else. \nOn May 9, for example, the pilot of United Airlines Flight 863 — traveling from San Francisco to Sydney, Australia — reported that the Boeing 777 hit a drone at an altitude of 3,000 to 4,000 feet along the California coast. \n“Sparks were observed after contact,” according to the FAA report, but the larger aircraft did not appear to be damaged, so it continued on its long-haul flight. A United spokesman said it was later determined that the plane had hit a bird, not a drone. [ Rogue drones a growing nuisance across the U.S. ] \nIn most cases, rogue drones disappear without a trace. The aircraft are usually too small to be detected by radar and do not carry transponders that would broadcast their locations. Unlike other planes, these drones are not marked with serial numbers, and their owners are not required to register them with authorities. \nNo incident has resulted in a midair collision. But in dozens of cases, pilots reported that drones flew within 500 feet of their aircraft, a distance so close that they often had no time to react. \nOn March 21, the crew of Delta Airlines Flight 874 told air-traffic controllers in New York that a small drone passed within 50 feet of the airliner’s left wing near LaGuardia Airport. One month earlier, on Feb. 24, another Delta flight heading toward Los Angeles reported that a red-and-black drone coming from the opposite direction overflew the Boeing 757 by just 100 feet. \nIn another incident near Los Angeles International Airport, American Airlines Flight 287 reported on June 8 that a blue-and-silver drone appeared 50 feet off the left side of the Boeing 737, just above the wing. \nElsewhere, Air Wisconsin — a regional carrier for United Airlines — reported on May 10 that a drone whizzed “right off the nose” of the passenger plane at an altitude of 5,000 feet outside Charlotte, N.C. Nine days later, another Air Wisconsin flight reported that a drone passed within 10 feet of the aircraft outside Philadelphia. \nUnited and several other air carriers declined to comment, referring questions to Airlines for America, an industry group. \nMelanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for the trade association, said it would continue to work with the FAA to educate the public about the safe use of drones. “The U.S. aviation system is the safest in the world, and nothing is more important to us than the safety of our passengers, crew and aircraft,” she said in an e-mail. \nRogue drones are posing a particular threat to small aircraft that often fly at lower altitudes than major air carriers. \nThe pilot of a single-engine Piper P-28 reported making a “hard left bank” on June 20 to avoid colliding with a small silver drone at an altitude of 5,200 feet above Groton, Conn. On Aug. 1, a Cessna pilot reported that a yellow drone the size of “a dishwasher” came within 50 feet as it was flying at an altitude of about 9,500 feet near Johnstown, Pa. \nMost of the drones were described as small and likely weighing only a few pounds, according to the reports. Aviation-safety experts say that even tiny drones could trigger a disaster by crashing into a propeller or windshield, or getting sucked into a jet engine. \nSmall drones have become hugely popular with consumers who fly them for recreation. Many models come equipped with sophisticated video cameras yet retail for less than $500 and can be flown with little or no training. \nThe Consumer Electronics Association, an industry group, estimates that hobbyists will buy 700,000 of the remote-controlled aircraft in the United States this year, a 63 percent increase from 2014. \nSome leading drone manufacturers have responded to concerns about safety by adding software fixes that automatically prevent the remote-controlled aircraft from flying near airports or above 400 feet. But some experts said clever drone owners can often find a way to override those limits.
