The casino has announced that it reached a comprehensive Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") with the UNITE HERE the world's largest union representing casino workers, and Local 19, to restore nearly 700 jobs that were lost when the casino closed.\nThe CBA negotiated between CGRC and UNITE HERE Local 19 guarantees good paying jobs and benefits for nearly 700 casino employees that were displaced when the casino was abruptly closed in 2014. The CBA calls for long term stability as the agreement is for a period of 5 years and provides for wages to increase during the term of the agreement. Specifically, employees will receive annual salary increases that exceed the rate of inflation as well as access to low cost, high quality health, dental and vision benefits. This agreement will guarantee that CGRC will once again inject some much needed economic vitality into the region.\nNew CGRC COO Christian Goode , formerly of Ivory Gaming, said, \"From the moment we set out to restore the casino, our first order of business was to take care of all our displaced employees who were the innocent victims of last year's closure. Today, we take an important step forward by establishing a new deal with our employees.\" Goode added, \"This is just the beginning of the economic benefits we expect to bring to the entire region, and it starts with making sure our employees are taken care of financially and have access to quality benefits.\"\nEnrique Fernandez , of UNITE HERE Local 19, said, \"It's a new day at Chukchansi, new management, and a new approach, the wages and benefits our Chukchansi members will receive signify the tribe's and casino's commitment to their employees. We look forward to this new partnership.\" Fernandez, noted that \"we hope to replicate the new Chukchansi model for negotiating partners in other casinos across the state.\"\nTribal Chairman, Reggie Lewis is also extremely pleased with the developments and stated, \"These are just the next steps on our journey to provide our Tribal members with opportunity and economic stability that will pave the way to self-sufficiency for generations. We are very excited that we have Union partners who will work with us to provide great jobs to our best in the business employees.\"\nFor more information, please call (559) 692-5200 or email info@chukchansigold.com\nChukchansi Gold Resort & Casino features live table games action, reel and video slot machines, a 300-seat award winning buffet, Vintage our world-class steakhouse, over 400 luxurious hotel rooms and suites, a full service spa and various other amenities.\n releases/picayune-rancheria-of-chukchansi-indians-tribe-through-its-wholly-owned-tribal-enterprise-chukchansi-economic-development-authority-ceda-announces-that-the-chukchansi-gold-resort--casino-has-reached-a-deal-with-unite-he-300129249.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/picayune-rancheria-of-chukchansi-indians-tribe-through-its-wholly-owned-tribal-enterprise-chukchansi-economic-development-authority-ceda-announces-that-the-chukchansi-gold-resort--casino-has-reached-a-deal-with-unite-he-300129249.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY80737&Transmission_Id=201508171053PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY80737&DateId=20150817"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:36:33.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
