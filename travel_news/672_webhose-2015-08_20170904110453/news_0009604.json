Providing a fresh approach to car insurance, Metromile brings an affordable and innovative model to the third most expensive location nationwide for auto insurance. This pay-per-mile model is the ideal solution for the more than 60 percent of Pennsylvania drivers who drive less than 20 miles per-day as they are considered low-mileage drivers (driving less than 10,000 miles/year). In addition, Metromile also offers drivers the latest innovations in smart driving via its Metromile app and connected car devices.\n\" Pennsylvania is a great fit for a per-mile auto insurance option,\" said Dan Preston , CEO of Metromile. \"Drivers in the big cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have access to a wide variety of public transportation in addition to bike-friendly commute options. Ultimately, those Pennsylvanians who own cars they rarely drive are overpaying for auto insurance.\"\nMetromile is responding to the driver's desire for a smarter driving experience and has pioneered new technology to bring an innovative approach to an antiquated industry. Insurance customers will receive the Metromile Pulse, a gadget that connects to the driver's onboard diagnostic (OBD-II) port and wirelessly obtains and transmits data to the Metromile driving app. From the app, drivers can then access insights to personalized driving trends and diagnostics â€“ taking car insurance beyond the claim and ensuring a more informed and connected experience. Non-insurance customers seeking a smart driving experience can benefit from the Metromile Tag, a Bluetooth device which provides insights such as commute optimization, mileage tracking, parking GPS and more. The Tag is currently available at no cost when signing up for the free Metromile app. No matter what car you're driving, Metromile ensures an affordable, simple, convenient and smart experience.\nPennsylvania marks the second state on the East Coast to offer Metromile's per-mile insurance and joins California , Illinois , Washington , Oregon and Virginia nationwide. Policies are sold through Metromile Insurance Services LLC and are written by insurers in the National General Insurance Group.\nFor more information about Metromile, visit metromile.com or follow Metromile on Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn .\nAbout Metromile\nMetromile is revolutionizing car insurance through technology.
