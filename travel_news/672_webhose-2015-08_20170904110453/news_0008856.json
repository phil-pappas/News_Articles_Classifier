The innovations, to be displayed throughout the venue and designed and built by MET Studio London, include a digital chandelier hung in the reception, live video walls on the second floor, full-height sculpture displays in the stairwells, and show wall featuring 100 engineering ideas that changed the world. \nThe video walls and digital chandelier, representing the convergence of various engineering sectors the IET represents, can be personalised for large events and connected to live comment feeds and events portals to encourage global debate and discussion. Upon opening in the autumn, the venue will also unveil a series of 100 engineering ideas that changed the world and helped innovate and shape the sector, as voted for by IET members around the world. The objects are seen as a celebration of the engineering ideas that have had the most impact on humanity and reflect the historic past of the IET. Filling the venue’s two stairwells, full-height, semi-translucent sculptures will be suspended from the ceiling and reflect the past, present and future story of the IET. Famous members and well known faces including T Karl Benz, inventor of the first car powered by an internal combustion engine, and aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic will adorn the interior. Reflecting the venue’s first-class technological investment, the installations will complement the infrastructure already available to event organisers, who will be able to integrate the exhibits’ technology seamlessly into their events. The flexible event space boasts panoramic views of London and will hold over 600 delegates in the two new auditoriums. Along with the engineering exhibition, other key improvements include a new roof terrace, cutting-edge technology, an enlarged riverside suite, brand new second lecture theatre, state of the art boardrooms and a ‘sesame lift’ at the front of the building, enabling the stone steps to retract automatically for wheelchair access. Simon Timmis, senior marketing manager for IET Venues and Events commented: “The development of these exhibits is hugely exciting for all involved. It represents and celebrates the best in engineering accomplishments and reminds us of the huge positive impact that technological invention can have. We are very much looking forward to showcasing it at the end of the year as it will provide a fantastic backdrop for conferences and events, and is really what sets us apart from other venues in London.” The announcement comes as IET London: Savoy Place moves into the final stages of its redesign. The flagship venue has been closed since July 2013 and the major £30m project aims to position IET London: Savoy Place as a first-class event facility and a ‘Global Engineering Hub’ to IET members and the engineering community. IET London: Savoy Place will open its doors for internal events in October, with the venue fully opening in November 2015.
