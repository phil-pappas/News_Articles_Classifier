GEORGE — St. George is the perfect place for a sunny weekend escape. It's a desert playground that offers hiking, golfing, biking, climbing and many more family friendly activities.\nHere are five fun things to do in St. George:\n1. Explore Snow Canyon\nDo not miss this place! It offers beautiful scenery and several good hiking trails. These are the trails I enjoy most in the canyon:\nJennys Canyon trail — A short and easy walk that ends in a slot canyon. This is a great hike for kids because they will love climbing around the small alcoves in the slot canyon.\nJohnson Canyon — This is an easy hike that winds through a natural spring and trees with a stunning arch near the end of the trail.\nSand dunes — Located near the canyon entrance, this is a fun spot for the kids to roll and jump down the soft sandy hills. Bring along some sand toys and they will dig for hours.\nLava tubes — This trail offers a flat walk through a field of underground lava tubes. Bring a flashlight. The tubes don't go back very far, but they are fun to explore for a bit.\nPioneer Names trail — A quick walk up a smooth rock slope allows hikers to view names of pioneer settlers written in axle grease on the rock face. The names date back to the 1800s.\nCanyon address: 1002 N. Snow Canyon Road in Ivins.\n2. Discover stunning petroglyphs\nThis place is too spectacular not to share with the public. After a short hike up a dirt road, you will arrive at a cliff's edge, dotted with large square brown and cream boulders. As you explore the angles of these massive rocks, you will discover a variety of stunning petroglyphs.\n3. Go mining for gypsum Crystals\nThe crystal mine is a sparkling hole in the ground where you can chip away at the rocky edges and take home chunks of gypsum crystals. It's so much fun, and your kids will feel like they are digging for treasure. Make sure to bring along hammers and chisels to mine with and bags to carry home your loot.\n4. Ride the canyon bike path\nSt. George has a great paved bike pathway that stretches through the city, past the Entrada area, then up through Snow Canyon. Perfect for a long road bike ride.\nYou can start your ride at the top of Snow Canyon or you begin in a parking area on the right side of Snow Canyon Drive.\n5. Have a family picnic at an adventure park\nPioneer park is a 52-acre red rock hillside with no playground equipment needed. Boy scout cave is also fun to explore (my kids like to think it was an old jail). There is also a slot canyon challenge to try (if you're not claustrophobic.) As you make your way through, it becomes more narrow, and you feel like you may get stuck between the rock walls.\nAddress: Red Hills Parkway\nCottonwood Cove Park is possibly the most well designed park for kids that I've seen. It's landscaped beautifully, and it features a small climbing wall and a huge playground made up of creative contraption-style equipment.\nAddress: 1027 South Dixie Drive\nIf you haven't experienced St. George's striking landscape, warm air, and abundance of outdoor activity options, then get yourself there soon. If you have visited, go back and try something new and adventurous!\nAmber is co-founder of the travel blog globecandy.com. She currently resides in Cedar Hills, Utah with her husband and three boys.
