We have received volumes of enquiries about this scam and remain concerned that a considerable number of them are those who have applied already. We cannot emphasise enough the need to ascertain information placed in the public domain by unknown sources,” said SAA Spokesperson, Tlali Tlali. “The recruitment cannot possibly be true given the employment freeze and headcount rationalisation taking place at SAA at the moment” added Tlali.\nSAA would like to urge members of the public to be vigilant, cautious and take steps to protect their personal information by verifying the existence or otherwise of any recruitment drive before acting on it. “The communication in question bears all the hallmarks of a scam and seems to be preying on unsuspecting youth. Our human resources division is at our head office, Airways Park, which is situated at OR Tambo International and not in Centurion as suggested in the false advert,” explained Tlali.\nSAA advertises all recruitment vacancies, as well as recruitment campaigns for Youth Development Programmes, on our web- site: flysaa.pnet.co.za. When candidates apply for any vacancy via the flysaa.pnet portal they have to upload a copy of their CV, ID and qualifications. No registration or application fee is applicable nor requested when applying for any of SAA vacancies. It is also free to register on flysaa.pnet.\nThe airline is collaborating with the external law enforcement agencies to trace the origins of the recruitment scam and those behind it. To those who have already submitted their personal information, SAA recommends that they report the matter to the local police without delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:52:33.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
