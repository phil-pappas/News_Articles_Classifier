Fly to meet Santa in his Arctic homeland on the day trip of a lifetime. It’s one of the amazing prizes up for grabs for Daily Mirror readers who vote in the holiday “Oscars”.\nThe Daily Mirror is the official media partner of the prestigious British Travel Awards – which honour the firms that make your time off extra special – and the public vote is now live until September 30.\nEveryone who submits a vote for the benchmark awards is entered into a draw for a treasure chest of fantastic prizes worth a whopping £30,000-plus in total.\nAnd one of those is a fun-packed festive Enchanting Lapland Day Tour, courtesy of Lapland specialist Canterbury Travel.\nTwo people will experience traditional Arctic activities, including a sleigh transfer from the airport, husky and reindeer sleigh rides, an igloo visit, tobogganing and the chance to drive a snowmobile. And of course you get to meet the Big Fella in Red!\nThe trip departs from Manchester or Gatwick on specific dates in December and comes with in-flight catering, lunch and thermal clothing to keep you toasty and warm in that Arctic chill.\nEach week on these pages we’ll highlight another great British Travel Awards prize up for grabs – it could be a cruise, free flights or holiday vouchers and discounts.\nHow it works You vote by going online to britishtravelawards.com and it’s all scrutinised by leading accountancy company Deloitte.\nIt’s now been opened up to those abroad and not just in the UK – so if you’re reading our international editions or an overseas online reader, you can vote too.\nThere are more than 70 categories but you do not have to vote in them all – you can opt for as many or as few as you wish.\nSo, for example, if you want to just vote for your favourite coach holidays company and nothing else, that’s fine. It’s that simple.\nThe online voting form also allows you to return to it as many times as you like up to September 30 to change your votes or add new ones.\nYou’ll also be invited to take part in a travel survey that looks at holiday plans for 2016. It’s voluntary and, like the awards voting, you can complete as much or as little of it as you like.\nAnd as a thank you for taking part in the survey you get a bonus entry in the holiday prize draw!\nThe award winners will be announced at a glittering gala evening in London on November 25.\nFull terms and conditions and the vote form at britishtravelawards.com DailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://britishtravelawards.com/vote_form.php", "http://britishtravelawards.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "https://canterbury-travel.com/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-08-01T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:28:30.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
