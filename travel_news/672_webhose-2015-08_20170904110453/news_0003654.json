Throughout this release the Company refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the tables attached to this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP.\n“We generated our second consecutive quarter of double digit comparable systemwide RevPAR growth,” said RLHC President & CEO Greg Mount. “Importantly, these outstanding results were driven by significant lifts in both occupancy and rate, underscoring the strong consumer reception to our product, marketing vehicles and RevPak guest management system, all of which is enabling us to take share from competitors. This revenue growth, coupled with the sustainable operational improvements we have implemented, drove considerable hotel margin expansion and supported our ninth consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA.”\nMr. Mount continued, “We not only posted strong performance at our core hotels, we have also made significant progress on our national expansion strategy. We opened our first Hotel RL at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor last weekend and the guest response to the new brand has been even better than we hoped. In addition, year-to-date, we have executed 16 franchise and management agreements for our core Red Lion brands, which expanded our footprint into Colorado, Pennsylvania and Texas. Further, with the closing of our acquisition of the GuestHouse International and Settle Inn brands in April, we have more than doubled our national footprint with 129 properties in 30 states. Integration is on track and we expect to leverage our superior technology and operating programs to meaningfully enhance the performance of these hotels. With a full suite of brands across the upscale, midscale and economy segments, we believe we have substantial runway to drive continued growth for RLHC and our shareholders.”\nSource:-RLHC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:27:56.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
