Comment By Staff and wire reports recordonline.com By Staff and wire reports Posted Aug. 28, 2015 at 2:36 PM Updated Aug 28, 2015 at 6:08 PM By Staff and wire reports Posted Aug. 28, 2015 at 2:36 PM Updated Aug 28, 2015 at 6:08 PM » Social News UPDATE (5:15 p.m.): NEW WINDSOR - A pilot was killed after his propeller-driven stunt plane crashed while he was practicing tricks for a weekend air show at Stewart International Airport, state police said Friday. Trooper Steven Nevel said the accident happened around 2 p.m. Friday at Stewart, where the New York Air Show is scheduled to take place this weekend. The pilot was the only person in the plane. His name wasn't immediately released. The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane was a Giles G202 experimental aircraft owned by stunt pilot Andrew Wright of Austin, Tex. Wright took a local reporter for a preview flight earlier and was scheduled to perform at the show. Benjamin Granucci, a photographer and editor for the website nycaviation.com , photographed the wreck as it happened. He said the pilot had flown several passes, performing a variety of tricks, when he went into a dive followed by a steep, corkscrewing climb. \"Partway through the corkscrew he slowed down,\" Granucci said. But he said that he didn't think anything was wrong until he saw the plane flying into an area off-limits to performers because of its proximity to spectators. \"After he was clear of that area, he sort of stopped and just started spinning to the ground,\" Granucci said. Granucci said he heard a thud but didn't see the plane hit the ground because his view was obscured by trees and a small hill. He said that when he reviewed his photos, they appeared to show the tail section of the plane twisting off in mid-flight. On his website, Wright says he has been flying competition and air show acrobatics in the lightweight carbon fiber G202 since 2001. In his performances, Wright climbs, rolls, loops and spirals in the small white plane with color-changing striped wings, leaving a trail of smoke. In a trademark maneuver, he flies straight up until the engine stalls and the plane falls tail-first toward the ground, with the engine roaring back to life moments before the aircraft would hit the ground. Orange County Executive Steven M. Neuhaus, the County’s Department of Emergency Services, the state police and the Federal Aviation Administration are on the scene of the accident. The New York Air National Guard also responded immediately to the scene. Practice for the day for the air show was canceled. According to a statement from Neuhaus' office, the air show is still scheduled to go on Saturday and Sunday. A woman at the air show box office also said the show will go on. Commercial air traffic is still operating at Stewart. Since Jan. 1, 2010, there have been 46 incidents at air shows in the U.S., including crashes, reported to the National Transportation Safety Board. Of those, 17 incidents and crashes have led to 29 fatalities. There have been seven such incidents in 2015, and three fatalities. The largest-scale fatality in the past five years was the Sept. 16, 2011 crash at an air race in Reno, Nev. In that event, a plane crashed into the spectator seating area, killing 10 spectators and the pilot, and injuring 66 people. Causes for the fatal crashes range from human error or illness to mechanical failure.
