Suzy Strutner Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 08/31/2015 02:13 PM EDT \nIf you could tell visitors to do ONE thing in your state, what would it be? \nWe asked a handful of Huffington Post editors and our Facebook friends for the all-time best activity to do in each state. The only rule? The activity must involve a swimsuit, because it's the end of summer and we're ready to go out with a splash. \nNot every adventure below is 100 percent perfectly suited for bikini attire: Some may include mountain hikes or cavern crawls that call for at least a T-shirt. But in any case, the lineup of waterfalls, canoe trips, national parks and surf spots is worth laboring on... just in time for Labor Day Weekend.
