Then get yourself a Bavarian dress called Dirndl; and if you got a guy, drag him along and outfit him in a pair of Lederhosen. \nStyles and prices of these \"Trachten\" (traditional Bavarian costumes) vary widely; you can get a sassy, short vintage Dirndl for 50 Euros or a richly embroidered custom-made dress for a couple of hundred Euros. \nEither way, it's a fun way to be part of the festivities, and Munich is the best place to go shopping for your outfit. Have a look at this selection of recommended Munich shops to find your perfect Oktoberfest outfit. 1. Angermaier \nFor over 60 years, the specialty shop Angermaier has been selling traditional Bavarian costumes in fine quality, from Dirndl and Lederhosen, to accessoires, and shoes. During Oktoberfest, Angermaier offers a \"Wiesn-Special\" - a Dirndl set, complete with dress, shoes, scarf, and apron (around 129 Euro), or a Lederhosen combo, consisting of short leather pants, shirt, and shoes (for around 200 Euros). \nAddress: Rosental 10, 80331 Munich; Phone: +49 89 23 00 01 99 Landsberger Straße 101-103, 80339 Munich, Phone: +49 89 50 16 77 \nOpening Hours: 2.
