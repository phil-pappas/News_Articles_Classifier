You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Thomas Hawk /Flickr \n…Vegas, Baby! If you like twinkly lights, gambling, buffets, desert heat, and resort-like environments – this daydream is for you. There is something for everyone here. You want to see New York, Paris, and Italy (artificial replicas, but still!) all in the same day? Vegas! You want to ride a roller coaster, get a massage, and do some shopping, all before seeing Cirque du Soleil? Vegas! You want to sit at a slot machine and sip daiquiris all day? Vegas! And if none of the above interest you, there are plenty of other awesome adventures you can have in Vegas that have nothing to do with gambling or the strip. Happy Friday Day, Dreamers!
