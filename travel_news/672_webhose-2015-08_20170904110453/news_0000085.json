That and cricket. The two were combined in the name of the village cricket club – Morton Colliery CC. Coal mining ceased in Morton in 1965 but cricket lives on to bring the community together, to such an effect that the club have been selected as one of the six finalists in this year’s Yorkshire Tea Great Cricket Tea Challenge . Cricket and coal both arrived in Morton in 1865. George Stephenson, the “father of the railways”, had founded the Clay Cross Company in 1837 to mine coal in the area and in 1865 opened a mine in Morton. The newly expanded population began playing cricket, too. Nets, covers, a smooth and fast outfield and Heath Robinson-esque sightscreens, built by a local welder, are evidence of a much-loved club Morton Colliery CC are a beacon in the community, proudly “punching above our weight” in the words of treasurer David Williamson. Dedicated committee members invested much time and energy over the years to acquire the ground from a local landowner and the club now owns it outright. The four acres of land will be a cricket pitch in perpetuity. Nets, covers, a smooth and fast outfield and Heath Robinson-esque sightscreens, built by a local welder, are evidence of a much-loved club. The club has teams from Kwik Cricket age, through under-13s and under-15s, and put out two XIs on a Saturday in the Derbyshire County Cricket League and one on a Sunday in the Mansfield League. New blood is energising the playing side of the club and the first team are all under 24 and home-grown. They were playing away from home on the day that former Middlesex and England captain Mike Gatting, my fellow Great Cricket Tea Challenge judge, and I visited. While the first XI secured a winning draw, the second XI beat Cutthorpe. Batting (perhaps crucially) after the tea interval, they chased down a target of 190 to win by five wickets. We always talk about the ethos of cricket being what it does for the community. Morton Colliery Cricket Club is at the heart of its community Morton’s heroes were bowlers Paul Thompson (four for 38) and Pete van Rensburg (two for 32), while Edward Williamson and Jack Dring both scored fifties. Gatting was deeply impressed with the spirit of the place. “This is a great family club,” he said. “We always talk about the ethos of cricket being what it does for the community. Morton Colliery Cricket Club is at the heart of its community, the only live sport around here for miles.” And at the heart of the club is the tea they lay on. Beccie Deighton, assistant brand manager at Yorkshire Tea, said that the club’s “proper home-made grub” had put them in the final six of the Great Tea Challenge. “The tea ladies here serve up cottage pie, chilli con carne and rhubarb crumble – a proper way to test the opposition after the tea break.” Meet the other Great Cricket Tea Challenge finalists>> • Ebernoe CC • Bishop Thornton CC • Uffington CC • Newton Linford CC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:30:06.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
