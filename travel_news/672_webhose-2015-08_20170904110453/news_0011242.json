Maybe you’ve even started envisioning your social media uploads. (Was that an embarrassing accidental confession? That one might just be me.) But other times, you have no clue. Maybe you’re trying to please a group of people with varying needs, maybe you’re not feeling too flush and are willing to go wherever’s cheap, or maybe you’re just drawing a blank. \nWhatever it is, when travel inspiration is needed, here are some tools to help you tap into your travel-planning subconscious and create the perfect trip. Google Flights , Explore Destinations: Google, the search engine of our lives, is obviously a logical place to start to see what’s out there in the big, wide world. The “Explore Destinations” map tool is particularly handy. Once you’ve entered your home airport or area and travel dates, it plots out the cheapest airfares found for destination dots across the map. When you click on any given dot, a box pops up with a summary of key info, including fares graphed for nearby dates so you can quickly see when the cheapest flight is available. Another way to go with Google is to roll the dice with the “I’m Feeling Lucky” function. Hitting the button alongside the search bar will generate at random a trip to somewhere in the world, such as a nonstop round trip between New York and Frankfurt for $783 in mid-September. Not lucky enough for you? Keep hitting it. Kayak Explore and Top 25 alerts: On Kayak Explore, you can generate a whole slew of trip options by entering your departure airport or area and picking a season or month. You also can specify an activity like “beach” or “gambling” in order to make sure your trip meets your travel desires. It’s pretty similar to Google’s “Explore” option, but it allows you to cast a wider net. And to give credit where it’s due, Kayak’s version did come first. Pro Tip : Set up Kayak price alerts from your home airport or region to the “Top 25” destinations and Kayak will feed your inbox periodically with a digest of the lowest trip fares for the 25 most popularly-booked trips from your point of origin. Tripnary : This app works just like Tinder, but i nstead of images of potential dates, you’re swiping images of destination-specific landmarks. So you might see a photo of the fiery sunset over the Charles Bridge in Prague or a pic of the lush Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. As you swipe, the app saves your preferences and then, powered by Skyscanner, pulls up cheap flight options. It’s cool because maybe you would never have said “I totally want to go to Yangon, Myanmar,” but the app lets you know that, actually, you just might. Hopper’s Flight Explorer and Get the Flight Out : Hopper specializes in predictive pricing, so it’s a good place to turn when you want cost to inform your trip choice. The site offers a flight explorer tool where you can add multiple points of origin and destinations and a range of possible travel dates, and then pull up all your options in list format. And for those who like to er, fly by the seat of their pants there’s Hopper’s Get the Flight Out app available on iOS. It’s essentially a HotelTonight for flights, where you can check out same-day flight deals from your designated point of origin. Now you can really get away from it all this weekend. Fareness : The newest of the bunch, this travel search engine launched just last week . It’s essentially a flight search engine that allows you to pull up the best deals based on broad search terms such as “New York to Europe” or “New York to anywhere” as well as based on pre-organized themes including “family” and “outdoors.” One last nugget comes from Hitlist , a bucket list-assisting travel app . The app recently rolled out its new Wandertab feature, a Google Chrome extension, which, once you’ve set it up, makes an amazing flight deal pop up each time you open a new tab, overlaid on an oh-my-God stunning photograph of its destination locale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T07:00:21.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
