To earn the badge, Scouts must perform a number of aviation-related activities, including learning about careers in aviation, airport operations, how to pre-flight an aircraft, and how to build a paper airplane. Scouts will also be able to tour the airfield, see aircraft demos, and take a flight with the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA). Ninety-one Scouts have registered for the event, to be held on Saturday, August 15 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at SMD, 426 W. Ludwig Rd., Fort Wayne, IN 46825.\n“The airport authority takes pride in its focus on education at Smith Field, “ said Scott Hinderman, Executive Director of Airports for the Fort Wayne-Allen County Airport Authority. “This event has proven successful every year and we always welcome the opportunity to educate young people on the importance of aviation.”\nThe aviation merit badge is one of more than 130 badges a Boy Scout may earn. There are 10 requirements for earning the badge, all of which can be fulfilled at the SMD event. Visit www.scouting.org for a detailed listing of the requirements and to find out more about the Boy Scouts of America.\nSource:- FWI Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:17:04.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
