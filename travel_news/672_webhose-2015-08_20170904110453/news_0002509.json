Delta spokesman Anthony Blacks said the flight carrying 149 passengers and five crew landed safely with no injuries. \nJetBlue Flight 1834, an Airbus A-320, was arriving from Port-au-Prince, Haiti, earlier that day when the pilot also reported seeing a drone near the airport. The pilot did not take evasive action to avoid the drone, the FAA said. \nIn the audio recording, the cockpit says the drone passed just below the plane's nose when the plane was flying at an altitude of about 800 to 900 feet. \nBoth airplanes landed safely. The FAA said it's investigating the incidents. It's unclear whether they were related. \nJetBlue spokeswoman Kate McMillan says the airline had not confirmed the report with the crew of the aircraft. \nDrones are not supposed to fly within 5 miles (8km) of an airport without notifying the control tower. They are also not supposed to fly above 400 feet. \nDrones flying too close to commercial flights threaten large aircraft as they can be sucked into the engine or crash into the cockpit window, Phil Derner of NYCaviation.com told CNN affiliate WPIX. Ad Feedback \nDave Mathewson, executive director of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, said, \"No unmanned aircraft should be flying in a way that poses a risk to manned aircraft.\" \n\"The key to safe and responsible operation is education, as many newcomers to the technology don't know where they should and should not fly,\" Mathewson said in a statement. \nUSA Today", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T02:20:04.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
