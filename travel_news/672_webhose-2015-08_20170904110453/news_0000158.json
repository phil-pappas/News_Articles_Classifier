Approval of the agreement is in the best interest of the United States and Israel.\nFor far too long, Iran was actively developing and expanding its nuclear infrastructure, closing the gap to a nuclear weapon. This agreement, negotiated by the United States, China, France, Germany, Great Britain, and Russia, halts and rolls-back this dangerous march through verifiable and measured steps.\nWe appreciate that many have reasonable concerns about the risks of a complex nuclear weapons development agreement with an untrustworthy adversary like Iran. We, too, hold these concerns, but the deal that was reached is not founded on trust; it is grounded in rigorous inspections and monitoring. We are united in saying that the negotiated deal on balance is good, that any available alternatives are worse, and that Congress killing the deal would be a tragic mistake.\nWe join Intelligence Committee Ranking members Senator Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff in concluding that this agreement is the best option for preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n• • •\nMel Levine Mickey Kantor, Eli Broad,\nNorman Lear, Frank Gehry, Stanley Gold, Irwin Jacobs\nDavid Abel, James Adler, Daniel Attias, Elaine Mitchell Attias, Lawrence Bender, Peter and Barbara Benedek, Michael Berenbaum, Donna Bojarsky, Peter Braun, Rabbi Sharon Brous, David Bubis, Rabbi Ken Chasen, Eli Chernow, Rabbi Neil Comess-Daniels, Bruce and Toni Corwin, Geoffrey Cowan, Bert Deixler, David Fisher, William and Patricia Flumenbaum, Terry Fruedman, Abner Goldstine, Rabbi Joshua Levine Grater, Arthur Greenberg, Earl Greinetz, Richard and Lois Gunther, Stephen Gunther, Janet Halbert, Michael Hirschfeld, Elaine Hoffman, Jane Jelenko and Bill Norris, Charles Kaplan, Marty Kaplan, Steven Kaplan and Janet Levine, Glenn and Miriam Krinsky, Luis and Lee Lainer, Mark Lainer, Peter Landesman, Shawn Landres, Shari Leinwand, Irwin Levin, Peachy Levy, Rabbi Richard N.
