It is a privilege to have such a high caliber group of professionals committing their time to join the event as panelists and also to provide one to one mentoring support to those who will be booking the sessions in advance. I must also thanks our supporters at WTM, AWTE and the University of Surrey for helping in making this possible!\nOne to one mentoring support is, I believe, a first for World Travel Market and possibly any travel related event. It will provide a huge opportunity to access some of the most professional and successful female travel entrepreneurs and professionals out there and receive advice or perhaps answers to an important question. A booking engine will soon become available via WTMâ€™s website, so watch this space!\nThe fact that so many have agreed to join the Women in Travel event notwithstanding a very busy WTM agenda can only mean one thing: the discussion around women in travel continues to be as relevant now as it ever was, whether the area of focus is entrepreneurship, leadership or corporate women climbing the career ladder!\nI am certain that the quality of discussion will be second to none and I am sure that we will all feel inspired and motivated by the talks. But I also know that there will be plenty of practical advice and take-away tips from no-nonsense, straight talking entrepreneurs, starting and growing their businesses. So make sure that the event is in your diary now and you do not miss attending the Women in Travel meet up on 3 November 2015, between 13.30 and 18.00.\nSource:- WTM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:11:56.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
