The number of operations (75,000 takeoffs and landings per year) outpaces several airports that handle commercial or scheduled flights in Pennsylvania. AGC supports a high volume of business and corporate-related activity. Aviation maintenance and flight instruction are also a dynamic part of AGC.\nIn 1939, President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed August 19 to be National Aviation Day. The day coincides with the birthday of Orville Wright, who piloted the Wright Flyer. He and his brother Wilbur are given credit for building the world’s first successful airplane with aircraft controls that enabled them to steer the plane.\nSource:- Pittsburgh International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:58:36.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
