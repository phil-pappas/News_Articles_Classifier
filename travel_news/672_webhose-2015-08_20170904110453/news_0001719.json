He occasionally plays piano for visitors. By David Goldman Associated Press • Sunday August 2, 2015 4:52 AM \nWHITE, Ga. — Nestled in a north Georgia forest, more than 4,000 classic cars decorate 32 acres that have been turned into a junkyard museum. \nOwner Walter Dean Lewis’ parents started the business in 1931 as a general store that also sold auto parts. Lewis grew the collection, which had just 40 cars in the ’70s, over time. \n“The only thing I ever knew was cars and trucks,” Lewis says. “I like to say I work for tomorrow, always thinking about the future. Someday they would be valuable.” \nLewis stopped selling parts about six years ago — soon after realizing he could sustain the business more as a museum, charging $15 for visitors just looking, $25 for photographers. He estimates that \n95 percent of the people who come through the 6 miles of trails of Old Car City are photographers. \nVisitors are greeted by artworks and hand-painted messages. On occasion, Eddie McDaniel, aka Fast Eddie, a childhood friend of Lewis’, plays blues piano next to a shotgun and a bear mounted on a wall. \nIn the 30 or 40 years that many of the cars have never moved, trees now grow through them and, in some cases, even lift them off the ground. One of Lewis’ more popular vehicles is a 1946 Ford truck used in Murder in Coweta County , a 1983 TV movie starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith. \n“It’s history,” Lewis says. “I saved them when other people were crushing them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:20:15.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
