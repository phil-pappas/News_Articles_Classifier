Today, Vivanta by Taj-Connemara in its ‘vintage cool’ avatar embraces the stylishly spirited Vivanta by Taj brand’s service philosophy, much as it complements its 19th Century legacy.\nCelebrating Madras Week and the Hotel’s deep-rooted connect with the city, Vivanta by Taj-Connemara presents ‘Chota Hazri and Burra Hazri’ – two of the most old-fashioned and charming meals of the leisurely days gone by. Chota Hazri, comprising Tea, Coffee, or Milk served with Toast, Cheese Chilly Toast, Mini Breakfast Rolls, or Morning Cookies, is like a little curtain raiser for breakfast, served in the early morning hours. This service will be available for residential guests staying in the Heritage Rooms at the Hotel. The signature collection of Vivanta by Taj-Connemara, these rooms give you more style and space! Right from Victorian arches, decor, to other elements of the interiors, these 700 sq ft rooms have hip modern amenities. The unique feature of these rooms is the 13.5 ft high ceiling which makes them some of the largest in the city.\nRemnant of an era gone by, Burra Hazri is an elaborate breakfast, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Fresh fruits (Papaya or Melon) and Porridge or Cereals (with cold or hot milk) is an energizing start to the Burra Hazri experience. Vegetarians can try the Potato cakes served with Devil Chutney; String Hoppers with Vegetable Moilee; Scrambled Masala Cottage Cheese (tomato and green chillies) with grilled onions and baked beans; Bread or Breakfast Rolls, Toast and Marmalade; Cheese and crackers; and Coffee or Tea. Non-vegetarians can enjoy String Hoppers and Fish Moilee; Grilled minute Steak and chips or Masala Mutton Chops; Omelette or fried/boiled eggs, bacon, ham and sausages; Toast and Marmalade; Cheese and crackers; and Coffee or Tea.\nFor a rendezvous with history, we have introduced the Champagne Heritage Walk, a guided walk giving a peek into the rich past of the property, and culminating with the Lady Connemara High Tea in the Heritage Wing. Enjoy your favourite pot of steaming hot tea from a collection of teas which includes Green Tea with Jasmine, Moroccan Mint Green Tea, Nuwara Eliya Pekoe, Pure Chamomile Flowers, Sencha Green Extra Special, Single Estate Darjeeling, and Earl Grey tea. Team these with short eats like Mini Quiche– mushroom, sundried tomato, asparagus and olives, chicken and tuna finger sandwiches, Smoked Salmon and Grilled sausage tarts, and relive some delightful moments from the days of the past.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Ahmar Siddiqui, General Manager, Vivanta by Taj-Connemara said, “We are proud that Vivanta by Taj-Connemara, one of the oldest and most-historic Hotels of the city, continues to be an integral part of Chennai’s glorious history. A veritable chronicler for this city, this ‘vintage cool’ hotel pays tribute to Madras Week by bringing alive two on the most-quaint historical repasts, Chota Hazri and Burra Hazri, giving guests in Chennai a taste of a bygone era.
