The closer you get to Christmas, the more crowded the resorts and theme parks will be. If you do go during a peak time, use every option you have to reduce the time you spend waiting in line, including FastPass+ , Rider Switch passes and single rider lines . \nWeather: December brings cool but comfortable daytime temperatures and chilly nights to Disney World. Bring a light jacket or sweater for mornings, and expect to don a jacket in the evening. Many of the holiday events in December are in the evening, so come prepared. Tips: \nTake advantage of the long holiday hours to see everything you want to when you visit the Disney theme parks. \nIf you are traveling with a baby or toddler , look for quiet spots for naptime on the go. \nIf restaurants are crowded at lunch or dinnertime, switch your meal times to more \"off\" hours, and grab one of Disney's best snack offerings while you wait. Warnings and Cautions: \nDisney resort pools are heated, but it may be too cold to swim in December. \nAllow extra time to get from place to place if you are relying on the Disney transportation system during the busy holiday period. \nMake dining reservations well in advance. The closer your vacation dates are to Christmas week, the harder it will be to secure a table at a restaurant without a reservation.
