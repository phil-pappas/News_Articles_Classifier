In addition to watching the pros in action, the influential writers also had the opportunity to test their skills on the venue for the 2017 Irish Open, when they played 18 holes on the Faldo Course at Lough Erne Resort. Earlier in the week, the journalists also had the opportunity to play Galgorm Castle and Darren Clarke’s home course of Dungannon Golf Club.\nPromoting golf in Northern Ireland is a major focus for Tourism Ireland, and David Boyce, Tourism Ireland’s deputy head of Britain, said: “We were delighted to invite these leading golf journalists to Fermanagh and Northern Ireland, helping to showcase the world-class golf on offer here to a huge audience of golf enthusiasts and potential holidaymakers. Tourism Ireland has an extensive programme of promotions under way this year, to highlight our world-class golf and encourage more people to consider a golfing holiday in Northern Ireland. Golf is the world’s largest sports-related travel market and we are working hard to drive home the message that a golfing holiday in Northern Ireland is about much more than a round of 18 holes – the combination of our world-class courses and our unique brand of hospitality plays a key role in attracting golfers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:25:05.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
