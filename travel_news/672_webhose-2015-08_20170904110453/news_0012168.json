Revenue per available room increased by 31.6% year-on-year. \nMr Basset called the performance of its hotels in Bangkok \"outstanding\", with first-half occupancy of 81%, up from 58% in the same period last year, while Phuket recorded 79%, up from 67%. \nPost-incident, average occupancy of its Bangkok hotels is 50-60%. The Novotel Platinum in the Pratunam area has seen 70 room cancellations since the bombing. \nMr Basset said the domestic tourist market was also important for Accor in Thailand, contributing 13% of the total.
