This was announced by Tourism Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Monday.\nThe famous beach temple is located around 340 km from Mumbai and enshrines a ‘swayambhu’ (self-evolved) stone idol of Lord Ganesha, facing the west, against a backdrop of lush green hills of the Konkan region.\nAmong the government initiatives planned to revamp the site are exploring options to operate seaplane or coast guard flights, create a theme park, a world class aquarium and beach safety and cleanliness arrangements, said Mungantiwar.\nHe added that the government plans to make arrangements for sufficient drinking water supply and sewage systems, underground drainage, proper public toilets, recycling plants, a sound and light show.\nOther facilities like more hotel accommodation, direct booking centres for railway and buses, hotels and lodging arrangements by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation will also be provided.\nThe tiny Ganpatipule village of 150 homes, with a population of around 450, presently attracts a whopping two million pilgrims and tourists annually, the minister said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:59:05.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
