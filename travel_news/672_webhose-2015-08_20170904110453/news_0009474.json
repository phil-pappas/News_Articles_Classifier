Never liked the city before but it looks like I have not much choice. So a bit of help appreciated: 1. Housing- Any options for a studio or a 1 or 2 BHK? I am trying to keep costs low as I will retain my apartment in Mumbai. So 25K is upper limit. I am not too keen on anything hated but need an apartment close to a vibrant market, cafe area. I want to retain the feel I have in my Mumbai place ie everything within walking distance and great restaurants and not rookery on living with primarily families. 2. How do people commute? I have not got much public transportation options online 3. Costs; I am assuming costs of living ( non housing) are in line with what I have in Mumbai. True? I am moving with the same company with a major promotion that is hard to say No to but want to not jump ship personally just yet Thanks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T09:10:53.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
