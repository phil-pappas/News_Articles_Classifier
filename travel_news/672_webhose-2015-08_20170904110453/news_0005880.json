(NYSE: DAL) still flies to Duluth, but for now only fromâ€¦ more Duluth has lost flights to several cities already this year, and officials worry that Delta may have quietly canceled a regular route to its hub in Detroit. When the Atlanta-based airline suspended daily Detroit-Duluth service last November for the winter months, there wasn't much concern; Delta (NYSE: DAL) had done the same thing in 2013 and restarted flights when the weather warmed up. But that hasn't happened this year, which means to reach Delta's key international hub, travelers have to fly through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (at a cost of about $700). Delta isn't commenting. Allegiant Air of Las Vegas pulled out of Duluth International Airport earlier this year; it had previously run flights to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Orlando, Fla.
