Stone flowed and fused, creating gravity-defying formations that remained undisturbed for ages.\nUntil 1879, when a hand reached up and snapped off a few million years of geological work, because that stalactite sure would look good in a frontier living room.\nThose who tour Colossal Cave east of Tucson can only imagine what wonders would exist within if environmentalism been a thing in the late 19th century. The first visitors were encouraged to take home souvenirs, so they plucked formations within reach.\nRELATED: 7 reasons to visit Colossal Cave\nThe damage stands out nearly 150 years later. Stony nubs poke from ceilings as if cave acne. Other formations sport unnaturally smooth edges and tops, rubbed that way from a thousand wayward, curious hands.\n(A practice that still continues as on a recent trip when, despite warnings from the guide, a few people groped nearby growths in ways that could only be described as stalagmite harassment.)\nIn addition, the water source that once fed Colossal Cave is long since gone, its labyrinthine interior declared dead decades ago. Local bats, however, still find it comfortable.\nAs a result, the cave is not as colossal as it could have been, and pales in comparison to the pristine and still-living Kartchner Caverns 30 miles southeast.\nStill, Colossal Cave has all the trappings one expects of an ages-old underground habitat, with narrow passageways twisting and turning among layered and colorful deposits.\nRELATED: Helmet & Headlamp Tour at Kartchner Caverns\nIts modern history is even more colorful, ranging from outlaws to B-movies, lending Colossal a trait not all caves possess — character.\nTour guide Robert Reyes unlocks the wrought-iron gate fit snugly into a shadowy gap in the hillside. Those who purchased tickets at the gift shop 30 feet away gather around, watching the guide step into the mountain and ducking their heads in anticipation of following him down the narrow passage.\nAfter stepping down the first dozen of Colossal’s 378 steps, visitors are enveloped in the very agreeable 70-degree air. While temperatures in some subterranean caves can dip into the 50s or lower, Colossal remains comfortable because it is inside a mountain rather than under one.\nSunlight dimmed as Reyes approached a small chamber, a low, narrow space with coarse, monochromatic walls.\nWhile lacking in form, the room had an important function for nearly 500 years beginning around 900. Archaeologists discovered evidence that Hohokam people used the cave as temporary shelter, Reyes told the group. The artifacts — found in this chamber and nowhere else in the cave — led researchers to conclude that the ancient people ventured no farther, and used the cave only temporarily.\nA more modern visitor immediately realized the cave could also shelter (and grow) his investment. Colossal’s first entrepreneur was a rancher who stumbled onto it when looking for stray cattle. He quickly realized it was a portal to tourism dollars.\nIt wasn’t until the 1930s when the cave operated as a full-time tourist destination. Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a Depression-era jobs program, built a half-mile flagstone path complete with handrails and lights.\nConduits were drilled through rock, and lights placed where necessary to brighten rather than illuminate. While hardly artful, it met tourism needs, and has now for more than 70 years.\nColossal reveals its inner beauty with subsequent chambers. Stalactites hang from the ceiling like icicles made of stone. Below, narrow columns grow in rows, their uneven shapes and heights formed over eons.\nReyes points out “cave bacon,” fragile translucent ridges that grow to 18 inches or longer. They cling precariously, almost impossibly, to the walls, looking as if an accidental brush of a shoulder would shatter them.\nPhotos: Kartchner Caverns\nThe new Helmet & Headlamp Tour at Kartchner Caverns gives visitors a new experience. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen Visitors enter Kartchner Caverns through a large steel door embedded into the hillside and then pass through a manmade tunnel and a series of airlocks. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen Kartchner Caverns Park began offering the Helmet & Headlamp Tour in March, a new way to see the caves. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen The original trail made by cave discoverers Randy Tufts and Gary Tenen in 1974 is still visible. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen A bristling forest of stalactites, stalagmites, columns and crystals fill the soaring rooms. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen Besides the Helmet & Headlamp Tour, two other guided tours are offered at Kartchner Caverns. Arizona State Parks Fullscreen Scientists estimate it would take more than 750 years of dripping water to accumulate one inch of solid material.

The main 50-minute tour lacks the large, awe-inspiring rooms that have made Kartchner Caverns so popular.\nBut Colossal does treat tourists to all the trappings that make caves popular destinations, especially those formations that resemble melting wax.\nAs Reyes leads the way, pointing out the structures and briefly explaining how they were formed, he mixes in some of the cave’s recent history.\nAnd what a history it’s been.\nThe Hohokam people using the cave as shelter never knew its true colossal-ness (and today’s spelunkers have just a vague idea, as only three of its estimated 35 miles of passageways have been mapped).\nThat began to change in 1879 thanks to a curious rancher and a few stray head of cattle.\nSolomon Lick was prowling the hills of his sprawling ranch for a few missing cows. He postponed the search when he noticed a small opening in the slope. Tucking low, he squeezed through the gap and into legend.\nArmed with candles for subsequent visits (and lending to the scorch marks evident on lower ceilings), Lick explored enough of the cave to realize its value as a tourist destination. He led visitors downward, and since environmentalism had yet to be invented — or at least widely adopted — Lick invited tourists to snap off a few specimens to take home.\nWhat had taken millions of years to create needed only seconds to be destroyed. But that stalactite probably looked great over the mantle.\nWord of the cave found its way to outlaws, who knew a great hideout when they saw one. The cave’s lore contains tales of robbers and escaped convicts seeking refuge from pursuing lawmen.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the cave found slightly more respectable employment as a bat-guano mine. Truckloads of the organic tailings, used in the making of gunpowder, were extracted before the mother lode played out. The cave fell dormant until entrepreneur Frank Schmidt realized its potential.\nTravel reporter Scott Craven talks about the discovery and eventual reveal of Kartchner and Colossal caves.\nWorking with local government officials in the 1920s, Schmidt opened Colossal Cave as a publicly operated entity, which it remains. Tourism took off in the mid-1930s once the Civilian Conservation Corp installed safe and manageable walkways.\nColossal has since been the setting for more than a dozen low-budget movies and TV shows, most of them Westerns and horror films. Highlights, using the term loosely, include 1972’s “Night of the Lepus” (hungry mutant rabbits go carnivore), 1975’s “The Outlaw Cats of Colossal Cave” (bobcats save a ranger, who saves them from hunters) and 1981’s “Frankenstein Island” (the mad scientist continues his family’s work amid genetically challenged people — mutated beings are apparently popular at Colossal Cave).\nBut tourism is the reason someone unlocks the cave’s front gate every day (though it sports openings, all of them inconveniently located).\nElizabeth Vega, 63, and her 33-year-old niece Catalina Guerrero had no intention of visiting Colossal Cave on a hot Saturday in June. But when they and the rest of the family arrived at Kartchner Caverns, the morning tours were sold out.\nStill in the mood for subterranean investigation, the family headed for Colossal, which Guerrero had never visited despite growing up in nearby Tucson.\nThe two women emerged with smiles on their faces, and Vega said she was happy her claustrophobic tendencies did not rise to the surface.\n“There were some tight places but I never got real nervous,” she said. “It was my first time in a cave and I loved seeing the formations. They were beautiful.”\nMost of Colossal’s visitors take the 50-minute, half-mile tour that dips six stories below the entrance. For those insulted by handrails and paved walkways, there are several tours that involve headlamps, ladders and tight spaces. The tours explore the farther corners of the mapped passages. There’s also a candlelight tour, allowing visitors to see the cave as early tourists did, only without taking home souvenirs.\nThe cave complex remains part of a working ranch, just as it was when it was discovered in 1879. On the other side of the hill, visitors will find La Posta Quemada (Burnt Post) Ranch, which offers trail and pony-cart rides as well as a petting zoo.\nThe good news? Guano mining is no longer an option. The better news? You can buy a $6 bag of dirt at the gift shop and be guaranteed a treasure (typically a polished stone or mineral) when you run it through the mining sluice. It’s a much more environmentally sensitive souvenir than snapping off a stalactite.\nColossal Cave Mountain Park\nWhat: A 2,400-acre park on a working ranch.
