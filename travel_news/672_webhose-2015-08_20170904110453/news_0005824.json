Upper case is the typographical equivalent of chucking a tanty.\nSo a schmick new anti-same-sex marriage campaign was off to a good start when it took out full-page ads screaming IT’S. NOT. MARRIAGE. They’re more than miffed.\nAnd they’re spreading their disgruntlement far and wide. They are on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Pinterest, Google plus, LinkedIn, as well as the web. They even have a hashtag (#ItsNotMarriage) so you know they’re seriously serious.\nThis week they were on the lawns of Parliament with bunches of flowers, which was pretty if slightly funereal. So who are these guys? And why are they so upset?\nMembers of the Christian Federation arrange flowers in front of Parliament House in Canberra, thanking Tony Abbott for supporting the current state of the Australian Marriage Act.

This is a man, a doctor, who argues that:\n“The day we cut marriage adrift from the rock of nature, from the mammalian order of male-female-young, is the day we lose any fundamental reason to deny ‘marriage equality’ to any consenting adults, whether polyamorous or incestuous. And that way madness lies.”\nYegads, no wonder he’s so upset and shouty, if that’s what he sees on the rainbow-lit horizon. But, as with Liberal rabblerouser Cory Bernardi, he has just got the wrong end of the gay stick. He can relax.\nMost of what he and the AMF say seems to have come from a scary but imaginary place. They think the natural world is under threat. And that’s not their fault — there is a mounting body of evidence that shows conservatives are inherently more afraid of the world around them changing, of the future.\nThe #ItsNotMarriage mob believe, erroneously, that marriage is a “rock of nature”, that changing the legal definition would disrupt that fictional rock, and that the rights of the children are somehow at risk.\nMarriage is no rock. It was invented by humans, it has changed throughout history, and will again.\nPolygamy was pretty common throughout the world in ancient times. One man, plenty of women. An ABC investigation notes that in Africa there are “female husbands” while native Americans have “two-spirit” people — men identifying as women who can marry men.\nMarriage has often been arranged — in the West as well as the East — and in the past was more about strategy and power than love.\nIt was only a decade ago that then-prime minister John Howard changed the definition of marriage in Australia to ban gay marriages.\nMarriage is an important social ritual but it is also a fluid concept. It will change to encompass gay marriage, but as for incest and polyamory? Dr van Gend is setting up quite the pairing of straw men there.\nThat would require different laws. Before that happens there would have to be a community and parliamentary debate. The idea that public sentiment is going to swing behind legal father-daughter couplings before we are all wiped out by an asteroid or climate change is highly unlikely.\nAlso Dr van Gend would hopefully loosen up if he realised how pointless sticking to this idea of “nature” is. It must be exhausting thinking of cars and Nespresso machines and polyester suits as evil. And how does he get by without stethoscopes, or post Twitter messages without worrying about the influence of such “unnatural” things?\nWe are living in an unnatural world. And most of the “unnatural” advancements have brought us longer lives, more comfortable surroundings, better human rights, and Netflix. Change is often good.\nOn their website the AMF says marriage is natural because it’s all about the babies. In fact they say that the state has no interest in recognising relationships that “cannot naturally give rise to children”.\nAll they need to do to get past that little barnacle is have an empathetic thought about all those couples who can’t have kids “naturally”. There’s lots of them. The IVF industry is booming.\nAs are childless-by-choice couples. Should they be kicked off the marriage bandwagon, too?\nThe anti-gay marriage movement, perhaps out of phallus-fear, is riddled with fallacies and fright. In this case, they have to learn to be a little less sensitive.\nOriginally published as You may think #ItsNotMarriage, but you’re wrong", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/you-may-think-itsnotmarriage-but-youre-wrong/story-fnpug1jf-1227479307446", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/08/11/1227479/307418-7602a262-4001-11e5-91d1-7a17ec48b9e9.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-12T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:44:12.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
