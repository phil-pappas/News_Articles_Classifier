Coombe Abbey Hotel, near Coventry, is taking advantage of the summer weather to build on huge growth in its afternoon tea business. Just a couple of years ago the hotel was serving tea to around 35 people a week – but that number has grown to around 150 a day! \nAnd now with the summer in full swing, the hotel has devised a way to allow more customers to enjoy its afternoon tea – and its superb parkland grounds.br> “Afternoon Tea To Go” contains a selection of freshly made sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream and cakes which are available as part of the hotel’s indoor afternoon tea, but its comes in its own box allowing customers to take it out into the 500 acres of parkland and enjoy at their leisure while catching some sunshine.br> The new afternoon tea has proved a double success for the hotel.br> Manager Ron Terry said: “We have been really pleased with the way we have grown our afternoon tea service. We have people coming from outside the local area because of the quality of the offer and the surroundings.br> “As you can imagine, serving up 800 afternoon teas a week is a major operation and it would be hard to accommodate many more customers indoors but we have some fantastic gardens and parklands. \"The Afternoon Tea To Go comes in its own box which is ideal to take it out and enjoy within the 500 acres of parkland around Coombe.br> “Our grounds are a major attraction in themselves, so it makes sense to combine the two together and give people a really memorable experience. I have to say that the weather has not harmed our prosecco sales either!” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:15:06.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
