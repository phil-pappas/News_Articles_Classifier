Those travelling in the Delta One cabin will also benefit from full flat-bed seats and a range of personalised dining options.\nGordon Dewar, Chief Executive of Edinburgh Airport commented:\n“Edinburgh Airport has witnessed exceptionally strong growth to North America over the past three years and in particular to New York. We are therefore delighted to welcome Delta to Edinburgh to maintain our continued development of the North American market.\nEdinburgh to New York is a flagship route between two vibrant economic and cultural power houses. The strong bonds between Scotland and America are well known and we look forward to welcoming even more inbound visitors from throughout America to Scotland’s capital city, and similarly assist more Scots in visiting North America.”\nCabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities Keith Brown also said: “Scotland and the United States share strong cultural and economic bonds, so this new direct service between Edinburgh and New York will only serve to strengthen these links.\n“This is excellent news for Scottish businesses, giving them enhanced direct access to American markets. It will also prove valuable for our tourism industry – by reducing the need for travellers to take extra connecting flights via London or the continent, we make Scotland even more attractive as a holiday destination.\n“Of course, we could attract more direct international flights like this to Scotland by cutting rates of Air Passenger Duty, and I once again call on the UK Government to transfer these powers to the Scottish Parliament as soon as possible.\n“I congratulate Edinburgh Airport and Delta on this announcement and look forward to the new service taking off next summer.”\nMore details on the routes:\nLaunch: 27 May 2016\nRotation: Daily\nFlight Times:\nFlight Times:\nFlight Times: Flight Departs Arrives DL 488/VS 4026 NY-JFK at 8:15 p.m. Edinburgh at 8:40 a.m. (+ 1 day) DL 4879/VS 4027 Edinburgh at 10:30 a.m. NY-JFK at 1:01 p.m.\nSource:- Edinburgh Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:02:32.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
