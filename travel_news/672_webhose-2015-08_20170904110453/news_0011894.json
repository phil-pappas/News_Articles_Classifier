An interactive window into the history and cultures of the islands and a labor of love for those who curate them, museums in the tropics not only are a fun break from the beach but also dish up history lessons worth learning. From Bob Marley’s gold records in Jamaica and George Washington’s four poster bed in Barbados to colorful art in Cuba and British naval cannons in Anguilla, check out our list of the coolest exhibits in the coolest Caribbean museums. \nAnguilla Curated by the most gracious Colville Petty, OBE (Order of the British Empire, if you please!), the artifacts are from his personal collection and organized by the various periods in the island’s history. (Photo: Melanie Reffes) \nFor a small museum on a small island, there’s a lot to see in the Heritage Museum Collection in the village of East End, just south of the popular Shoal Bay Beach. As the sign outside says, the museum really is ‘a peak into Anguilla’s past’. Curated by the most gracious Colville Petty, OBE (Order of the British Empire, if you please!), the artifacts are from his personal collection and organized by the various periods in the island’s history. On the front lawn, big petroleum powered cotton gins from 1908, copper pots from the 1700’s and British naval cannons are eye candy for history buffs. Inside the half-century old house that was once the home of Curator Petty’s parents, fascinating finds include relics from the Arawaks who were living on the island when Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492; memorabilia from the fishing, boat building and salt producing industries (the museum sits across the street from a salt pond); slave period antiquities and most impressive; relics from the rebellions in 1967 and 1969 that culminated in independence from England before the island became a British Overseas Territory in 1980. “I have been a collector all my life so it was natural for me to open the museum,” Petty smiles as he shows tourists his coveted collection of mugs and plates from Royal visits to island. The museum is open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5p.m. The gift shop stocks a small selection of locally-made souvenirs. \nJamaica An absolute must for fans of Bob Marley, the former home of the reggae icon is now a museum at 56 Hope Road in Kingston, Jamaica.

Simply called ‘George Washington House’ today, the museum also features a windmill and bathhouse from 1719 and a stable that was added in the 1800’s. (Photo: Melanie Reffes) \nThe only place outside North America where you can say “George Washington slept here” is in an 18th-century plantation house in Bush Hill. Simply called ‘ George Washington House ’ today, the museum also features a windmill and bathhouse from 1719 and a stable that was added in the 1800’s. As the story goes,19-year-old George Washington and his older brother Lawrence who was seeking treatment for tuberculosis rented the house overlooking Carlisle Bay for two months in 1751. In the centuries since, the house has been a base for French prisoners, part of the British military and was even converted to commercial offices during the 1940s. Once it was identified as the correct Washington house, it was restored and in 2007 the yellow house with green shutters was opened to the public. Decorated with period furnishings like a four poster bed with mosquito netting and a chamber pot as there were no indoor bathrooms, the museum also has a curious collection of period medical devices including pharmaceutical bottles, thumb lancets and cupping glasses which were heated to suction blood to the skin’s surface. Local trivia has it that young George contracted smallpox while living in the house and was treated by Dr. Lanaham, an island surgeon. Historians have noted the course of US history may have been changed had this doctor been less skillful in treating the deadly disease. Tours include a film about the future president’s stay on the island and time to explore the interactive museum furnished as it was for the Washington brothers. Open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with a USD$10.00 admission price for adults. \nCuba With travel to Cuba looming large for travelers from the US, art lovers will want to add Havana’s National Museum of Fine Arts or Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes as it is known in Spanish to their sightseeing bucket list. (Photo: cubacontemporanea.com) \nWith travel to Cuba looming large for travelers from the US, art lovers will want to add Havana’s National Museum of Fine Arts or Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes as it is known in Spanish to their sightseeing bucket list. Inspiring collections are housed in two separate buildings — one building dedicated to showcasing the paintings and sculptures of Cuban artists, with the second building housing an international collection of Greek, Roman and Egyptian art dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Opened in 1954, some exhibits reflect the politically-charged climate in the early 1960s after the Revolution of 1959 while others simply celebrate Cuban life. Perhaps most impressive is the work of contemporary artist Victor Manuel Garcia, whose painting of a Cuban woman called La Gitana Tropical or The Tropical Gipsy is considered the defining work of Cuban Avant-garde. \nCayman Islands The oldest museum in the Cayman Islands, Cayman Brac Museum was built in 1933 and today has accumulated a large collection of artifacts for such a small island. (Photo: Cayman Brac Museum) \nThe oldest museum in the Cayman Islands, Cayman Brac Museum was built in 1933 and today has accumulated a large collection of artifacts for such a small island. Located in Stake Bay, the museum is chockablock with unusual relics, from old dental pliers and pottery to antique eyeglasses and a scale model of the Caymanian catboat called ‘Alsons’. Recreating life as it was years ago, the front room is designed to look like the decades-old bank, post office, customs office and treasury. Other exhibits worth perusing include artifacts from the devastating hurricane of 1932, herbal folk-medicine remedies and a typical Caymanian bedroom with a quilted bed cover and pretty-painted wash basins. The Museum is open Wednesday and Saturday with free admission. A 30-minute plane ride from Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac (Brac is the Gaelic word for bluff) is 14 square miles and named for the 140-foot -high bluff called the “Brac”.
