But a rebellion by a large number of her allies would be a blow for Ms Merkel, who remains highly popular after 10 years in office.\nMs Merkel and Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble will make the case for backing the bail-out plan in party meetings on Tuesday.\nMr Schaeuble, who last month told parliament that talks on the third bail-out were a \"last attempt\" to solve the Greek crisis, threw his weight behind the package ahead of Wednesday’s vote and said Athens was ready to reform.\nMany senior figures in the ruling coalition agreed.\n\"The Greek government has worked very constructively, and has made a 180 degree change,\" SPD budget expert Carsten Schneider told television station n-tv, saying he would vote \"yes\" in Wednesday’s vote in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.\nBreaking ranks\nBut a significant minority of Ms Merkel’s conservatives — her Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party — oppose the plan.\nLast month, a record 65 legislators from the conservative camp broke ranks and refused to back negotiations on the bail-out. The daily Bild even estimated that up to 120 CDU and CSU members out of 311 might refuse to back the now-agreed deal.\nThe debate has been given added spice this time after Volker Kauder, head of the conservatives’ bloc in parliament, incensed fellow legislators earlier this month with threats of retaliation if they rebelled and voted against a bail-out.\nThe upshot is that those who opposed backing negotiations on the bail-out are unlikely to vote in favour of the package for fear of being accused of bowing to Mr Kauder.\nMr Schaeuble, who argued last month that Greece should consider a \"timeout\" from the eurozone, sought to shore up support for the bail-out ahead of Wednesday’s vote, citing a dramatic change in the Greek government’s readiness to reform.\nYet some legislators still supported the timeout idea for Greece that Mr Schaeuble floated last month.\n\"A temporary Grexit remains the right solution,\" said Christian von Stetten, a member of Ms Merkel’s CDU, who said he would vote \"no\" on Wednesday.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:10:42.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
