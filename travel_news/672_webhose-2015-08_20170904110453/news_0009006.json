It was my first trip in Argentina where I am currently residing because of office assignments. Around this time in last year, I was yet to make a long trip here apart from some very short trip to nearby places of Buenos Aires. When I came to Argentina, the first place which was on my wish list to be visited was the Iguazu falls. So I started planning for the same, but later thought of going there later as suddenly I thought of skiing in the Andes, and this was the perfect time to do the same. And Bariloche was my favourite for this reason, as it was one of the most beautiful places here, which is called as Switzerland of Latin America. I had a long weekend coming ahead just after ten days. And I could manage one more day leave at that time. So I planned to go during this time. But I was having really very short time to plan. Only ten days left and I am yet to book all the things! I have never done a proper tour in this manner and that also in a different country with Spanish speaking people! first when I told my plan to other people and asked if anyone is interested to join me nobody wished to go, rather advised that I also will not be able to make the trip with such a small time in hand without any booking ready. But I was stubborn to make it happen, hence thought of going alone. Going to such a place alone, was a tough decision, as more than 90% of the people there do not understand English and my Spanish communication skill was very very poor. But later one friend of mine joined me, though he also do not know Spanish. We have done the booking through Hostelsuites in Florida Street in Buenos Aires. We have booked the to and fro journey to Bariloche by bus. It was a long journey(more than 1600 km). But the buses were very comfortable, and having the food & toilet inside itself. And we wanted to see country through . Hence we booked the buses. We waited eagerly for 15th August, the day of starting. On 15th , it was a weird feeling, as being an Indian, for the first time we did not get a holiday as usual on 15th August. But throughout the day I was excited for the trip. The bus was scheduled to start at 7: 30 p.m. We went to Retiro bus terminal. And then became totally puzzled. All the announcements & display were in Spanish, we could not understand from where we can get our bus. It was a huge terminal. Nobody could help me by talking in English. After a lot of search, we found out the counter for the wanted bus agency. The person told us to come there just ten minutes prior to the departure time. Then only the station of departure could be confirmed. We roamed for some time. At 7: 20 p.m., I went to the counter and what a shock. The gentleman told- Sorry sir, you have missed your service, as your bus has already left. I was so tensed to hear this.But after few minutes, he checked the ticket again, and informed that the bus has not left, and informed us the platform number. We ran to the terminal & got inside. We have reserved the first two seats in the first floor of the bus, to get the best view on the go . Soon after we crossed the traffic of Buenos Aires we were served dinner. After that I relaxed, basically I like these nocturnal long journeys with soft tunes murmuring in the headphone of my Walkman. I cant recall when I went to world of dreams. Well, in the morning I woke up little late. The bus had couple of 5- 10 minutes stoppages. Most of the whole days journey was through the endless grassland, without any trace of human beings. It was something which I had never seen in India. At around 8:30 p.m. our journey ended at Bariloche. We got down in a small and deserted bus terminal. And soon all other people left, and we kept on waiting for our pick up cab as told by tour operator in Buenos Aires. After a while when we did not see any one coming, we called the tour operator help desk, but no answer! Then we called up the hostel number, first they denied of any bookings against our name! but later they confirmed it. After searching for some contact details of the cab operator at last we got it! Good thing was the operator understood English! At around 9:30 p.m. at last the cab came and dropped us to the hostel. We got a room of six people. We befriended an Argentine guy and a Columbian girl. They were also staying in our room, it was a nice and enjoyable company. The guy was to leave on the next day, he could give us some more information about the place. After some time we cooked the food in the kitchen of the hostel, had dinner and went to sleep along with sweet sound of rain on the roof, eagerly waiting for our first experience of skiing on the next day. Next morning we woke up early, had breakfast in our hostel and then asked the receptionist (we were lucky to have an English speaking lady) to help us by talking to the tour operators in Spanish and translating the required information to us. She called up the number and given us the direction to the tour agency office. When we went out the scenery was simply awesome. There was a huge lake just beside the city and in the opposite side of the lake there were snow clad mountains with their reflections on the lake water. We spent some time to enjoy the vista and then went on to search for the tour operator office. It was really tough to find it. But at last we got it. From there they have given us a ticket which was to be displayed at the base of Cerro Cathedral mountain skiing counter to get the skiing equipment. And they arranged for the cab also for the drop to Cerro cathedral. After a small journey we reached Cerro Cathedral mountain. We took our skiing gear and queued up in the line to get into the rope way to get on the mountain, there was a separate queue to get the ticket, so at first it was confusing and after coming to the end of the queue only we could understand this fact. So basically there were one queue where we had to book the ticket for the rope way to go on the mountain, then after getting the ticket we had to be in the queue to enter the rope way. Some time got wasted in all these, as both the queues were long. At last we got on the rope way and came to the mountain from where small chair lifts(it is like small rope way with small two seated chair instead of larger cable cars by which we came up to this place) would take us to the top of it from where we would come down via skiing. My friend got scared after coming this much and told that he do not want to break any bones by trying skiing which was completely unknown sport to both of us. We did not opt for any training thinking that the Spanish speaking instructor would not be very useful. But I did not want to miss the opportunity of giving it a try. Hence geared up, took a chair lift and went on top. The very moment when I came down of the chair lift, leave alone skiing, it became almost impossible to stand on the slope of snow, with those skiing boards on my legs! I was continuously slipping and falling as I was trying to stand on my feet! It was really very tough to come down by skiing, believe me though every other person was zooming away by skiing, without proper training it is really tough to do in this kind of slope. I literally got sweat in snow! But the view from the top of the mountain was simply mind blowing with snow clad peaks & blue lakes all around. I am just out of words to describe the beauty of the place. Just imagine fresh powdery snow clad mountain surrounded by numerous other similar peaks, and in the below the green valleys and blue coloured lakes are visible with their own marvel! I shall let the pictures do the talking instead of wasting so many words regarding the beauty. After spending the whole day over there.we came back to city of Bariloche. In the evening we were roaming around the streets. The city was simply awesome with beautifully structured buildings. The chocolates of Bariloche was very famous. So I had lots of chocolates from a famous shop named Rapa Nui. Then went back to the hostel room. In the night had a long chat with the Columbian girl about both our countries, had a fun time and I danced also with her with the tune of an unknown Spanish song . Then went to bed & sleep conquered easily after the tiring day. We had to wake up early for the next days seven lakes tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T05:55:10.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
