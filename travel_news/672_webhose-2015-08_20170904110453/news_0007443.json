The magazine has unveiled the results of its Readers’ Choice Survey of the world’s friendliest cities, with Dublin making it into second position (it was number five in 2014).\nThis is the latest award for Dublin – which was voted “favourite worldwide city” at the Trazee awards in Orlando, Florida, just last week.\nWelcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “This is another well-deserved accolade for Dublin. Again and again, our research shows us that the friendliness of our people is one of our unique selling points. It is the warm welcome and the ‘craic’ here that resonates with our overseas visitors and makes Dublin and Ireland such a great choice for a short break or holiday. This accolade by the readers of Condé Nast Traveler magazine gives Tourism Ireland a wonderful platform to continue to promote Dublin and the island of Ireland throughout the world as a ‘must-see’ destination. With world-class events like the upcoming Dublin Theatre Festival and Bram Stoker Festival, as well as the city’s rich heritage and culture, wonderful food and accommodation choices, Dublin is set to welcome many more overseas visitors this year, coming to experience all that this great city has to offer.”\nComments from the Condé Nast readers about Dublin included:\n“The people make the place” here, with “pubs and restaurants filled with locals and tourists alike, coming together to celebrate life.” (“I’ve never been somewhere with friendlier drinkers.”) “The Irish are so much fun,” and “there’s always a smiling face to talk to.” Top tips: “Best hidden gem is Marsh’s Library, smaller than the one at Trinity but more accessible,” and “ditch the crowded tour at Guinness and go directly to the bar at the top.” The city seems to have become “the ‘new’ Barcelona, without the sunstroke.”\nThe top ten friendliest cities, according to the 2015 survey, are:\nSydney, Australia Dublin Queenstown, New Zealand Kraków, Poland Bruges, Belgium Edinburgh, Scotland Kyoto, Japan Budapest, Hungary Auckland, New Zealand Reykjavik, Iceland\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:07:26.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
