The Intra-European market (standing for 60% of all arrivals in Europe) increased by a small 0.2%. Africa was also in a negative trend this 2nd quarter of 2015 with a -10.7% decrease. Asia & Oceania maintain a healthy growth while North America still benefit from a favourable currency exchange. International bookings to Europe for Q3 2015 are encouraging Middle East had a negative variation in Q2 2015 due to events such as the oil pricing slump which reduced the purchasing power and the business travels. Ramadan (from June 18 to July 17), has affected negatively this quarter, but the perspectives for Q3 are promising with a 25.2% growth of bookings from this area. Africa is up by +7.5% for future arrivals based on issued booking up to 30 of June. The region should recover the growing path after a bad performance during 2014 due to Ebola's crisis. The standard profile for long haul trips to Europe: last minute decision, 1-2 people, 1 week Stays between 1 to 8 days predominate in second quarter of 2015, and showed interesting increases. However, the shortest stay had a timid growth, almost flat, likely due to the slowdown in the business profile of Middle East visitors. Regarding the lead time, most common segment is still late bookers, who decide the final trend in the last minute. Solo and couple travellers remain the main part of the total arrivals (74%) but Groups segment (6+ pax), despite its low volume, maintains a healthy growth (+7.1%), mostly due to the Asian market.
