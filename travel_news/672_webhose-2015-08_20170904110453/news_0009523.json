The insects, which the Government says could pose a “significant threat to human health”, have killed at least seven people in France since 2004 and feast on honey bees, picking them off one by one as they come and go from their hives. The hornets are widely expected to make their way to the UK soon – either as stowaways in vehicles or goods, or simply by flying across the Channel. There have now been more than 1,000 “suspect reports” from worried members of the public who believe they have spotted the creatures over the past four years, a Government strategy published this week reveals. Although all reports have so far proved negative, the document shows that Britain is taking the threat so seriously that it has sent a rapid “response team” to France for training, as part of an unprecedented contingency plan for dealing with the insects. • Swarm of killer hornets make a beeline for Britain • Firefighters rescue couple after hornets nest fell through ceiling Three bee inspectors and three wildlife response officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency were sent to Bordeaux - the city where the hornets began their invasion of Europe – in autumn 2014 to “see nest detection and destruction in action”, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) confirmed. One desktop and two “field” contingency exercises have also taken place in the UK. The Asian hornet, or vespa velutina, is believed to have made its way to France in a shipment of pottery from China. It quickly established itself in the country, causing honey production to plummet, and has since spread to Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Italy and Germany. Asian hornet queens are up to 3cm long, and workers 2.5cm, slightly smaller than native European hornets. Unlike the European hornet, which has several yellow bands on its abdomen, Asian hornets have just one. Experts are keen to stress that while the Asian hornet poses a serious risk it is a different species to the two inch-long Asian giant hornet, or vespa mandarinia, which has killed dozens of people each year in Japan and China but is not believed to be present in Europe. The victims who were killed by the Asian hornet in France were generally stung several times and died of anaphylactic shock after suffering allergic reactions. • The most lethal invader . . . Asian hornet that preys on native bees • Asian hornets could invade Britain In its strategy document for tackling invasive species, Defra said there was “great concern” that the Asian hornet would reach Great Britain and that “establishment would have a detrimental impact on the beekeeping sector and on the environment and would also pose a risk to public health”. It said that early detection was “vital” to its plans to tackle any invasion. “We have established an alert system which allows the public to report sightings which are then identified by the National Bee Unit (NBU). There is also a network of sentinel apiaries that carry out active surveillance for the species. “If the Asian hornet is detected in Great Britain, the NBU and staff at the Animal and Plant Health Agency will work together to locate and destroy nests,” it said. As well as beekeepers, the Government is working with nurseries and garden centres to look out for the insects and has asked the public to report any sightings by emailing alertnonnative@ceh.ac.uk. While efforts to halt the hornets’ spread on the continent have so far struggled, fresh hope emerged earlier this month after the botanical garden in Nantes discovered that a carnivorous plant, the north American Sarracenia, was able to attract and kill the hornets. Biologists at the University of Tours are investigating why the plants attract the insects and are hoping to use the same pheromones to devise a trap for them. A Defra spokesman said: “Invasive non-native species are estimated to cost the UK economy £1.8 billion annually - damaging forestry, agriculture and infrastructure.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T21:25:37.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
