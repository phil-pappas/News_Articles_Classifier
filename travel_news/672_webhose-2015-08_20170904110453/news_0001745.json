It’s known to have nurtured talents like the late Bhupen Khakhar, and legends such as KG Subramanyan, Laxma Goud, Dhruva Mistry and Nasreen Mohamedi. \nAmong these, the works of Khakhar (1934 – 2003) and 91-year-old Subramanyan are celebrated around the world for their inimitable style and vivid language. \nNow, a month-long exhibition at Gallery 7, titled Legends of Baroda, will showcase 50 paper works by these masters, sourced from collectors around the world. \n“Both these highly talented artists are known for being quite elusive,” says gallery director Nicholai, who goes by only one name. “This is a rare opportunity to view an array of their works, spanning almost three decades, all under one roof.” \nWhile Khakhar was among the first modern Indian artists to portray homosexuality in his works, Subramanyan is known for colourful and whimsical animals in his art. Subramanyan is also considered one of the best teachers and art theorists in the country. \n“The contribution of the duo to Indian art and their impact on the art fraternity has been immense,” Nicholai says. “They have had and continue to have considerable influence on young artists.” \nAbout The eventWhat: Legends of Baroda, an exhibition of works by Bhupen Khakhar and KG SubramanyanWHERE: Gallery 7, Ground Floor, Oricon House, Kala GhodaWHEN: July 28 to August 28, 11 am to 7pmCALL: 2218-3996", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T19:36:14.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
