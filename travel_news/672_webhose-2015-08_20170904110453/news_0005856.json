Some of our most popular services are: \nDocument Checking Service \nSome applicants prefer to submit their own applications but they are not sure that they have provided the right documents or the correct information? They may be on a limited budget and might not want to pay a third party to secure their visa. Global Migrate provides a unique Document Checking Service which will put your mind at peace by offering legal advice and identifying any errors in your application. This service is available for all UK Visas, Australian Visas, Canadian Visas and Denmark Immigration. Even a simple mistake in your application may result in your application being refused which could have serious implications on any future applications. Once we have checked your documents we can assure you that process of waiting for the decision of your application will be stress free. We provide this service at a very competitive rate. This process does not mean your visa will be guaranteed as we only check your documents and give you our feedback. We do not take the responsibility of lodging your application. Therefore, if you want the best chances of securing your visa please call us on +44 (0)207 9934762 and speak to our highly trained advisors who might surprise you by telling you what our full service fee might be. In most cases it's normally less than what you are expecting. It might be worth your spend and will in the end be great value for your money. \nSame Day/Premium Service \nAs well as ensuring that applications are thoroughly prepared and presented, Global Migrate can also obtain same-day appointments with the UK Border Agency at short notice for many UK Visa applications. We are registered with the UK Border Agency to provide you with our Premium (Same Day) application service. This includes assessing the application with the aim of identifying any potential issues affecting the application and checking supporting documents required for the application. Please note: If the UKBA stops providing this service we will not be in a position to offer this service. Therefore, to take advantage of this service contacts us now. Most applications submitted by the Premium (Same Day) service are decided within one working day, and we will be able to advise the applicant of the outcome of the decision within 24 hours of the appointment. The supporting documents can then be returned to the applicant (or collected) on the next working day following the appointment. You will also benefit from the fact that one of our representatives will attend the appointment to submit the application on your behalf, hence providing you a hassle free and fast service.
