The series will also pause from time to time to look back at how far the \"family car\" has come. With a special anniversary episode and weekly MotorWeek \"Flashback\" vignettes, this season will look over the vehicles that were cutting-edge back in the '80s and compare those with vehicles that are cutting-edge today.\nJohn Davis will again lead a team of on-air reporters for MotorWeek 's 35 th season in rigorously testing and evaluating new vehicles and assessing cars' performance, practicality, efficiency, and safety. More than 150 cars are examined annually for the benefit of viewers. During the upcoming season, rare exotics such as the Mercedes-AMG GT-S and Bentley Mulsanne Speed will be featured along with the far more practical types of vehicles that families depend upon including new generations of the Honda Civic, Chevrolet Malibu, Toyota Tacoma, and the first-of-its-kind Tesla Model X all-electric crossover.\nMotorWeek 's feature line-up will continue with the return of popular segments such as \"Goss' Garage\" with MotorWeek 's resident master technician Pat Goss offering know-it-yourself car care advice. Yolanda Vazquez keeps viewers in the know on consumer trends with \"FYI\" features and up-to-date on the latest happenings with \"Motor News.\" Reporter Zach Maskell , in the \"Over the Edge\" segment, turns up the fun with a look at the auto world in overdrive. Brian Robinson takes a very hands-on look at the less-than-four-wheel motoring realm by reviewing the newest motorcycles and scooters in the \"Two Wheelin'\" segment. MotorWeek will also accelerate its coverage of the use of alternative fuels and advances in green power technologies as drivers race toward a cleaner driving future.\nProduced and distributed by Maryland Public Television, MotorWeek airs on 92% of PBS stations nationwide and can also be seen on the V-me Spanish-language network. Winner of dozens of prestigious automotive journalism awards, MotorWeek is also seen on Discovery's Velocity channel.
