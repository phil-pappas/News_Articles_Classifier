Every day, 44 children are injured; that's 16,000 kids each year.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7604531-safe-kids-worldwide-back-to-school/\nWhen kids are young, they are taught to look left, right, left before crossing the street, and to cross with an adult. But as they get older, and they are no longer with an adult, it is important to teach them that walking safely goes far beyond looking both ways before they step off the curb.\nWith kids back in school, now is the perfect time for a refresher course on walking safety. Safe Kids Worldwide and FedEx have teamed up to create an interactive infographic that demonstrates the seven common ways kids get hit, and how to avoid it.\n\"In less than five minutes, walkers can learn, or be reminded, how to not get hit by a car,\" said Kate Carr , President and CEO of Safe Kids Worldwide. \"We designed the infographic to be a fun teaching tool for parents and kids, but just about everyone recognizes themselves in the common mistakes walkers make. Drivers and walkers share the road, so we just have to be smart about it.\"\nCommon Mistakes Walkers Make\n# 1\nWalking while distracted by a phone or headphones.\nStat:\n1 in 5 high school students crosses the street while distracted.\nTip:\nPhones down, heads up when walking.\n# 2\nCrossing in the middle of the block.\nStat:\nCrossing someplace other than an intersection accounts for 81 percent of child pedestrian deaths.\nTip:\nTempted to cross mid-block? Don't do it. Take the extra time to cross at the corner.\n# 3\nWalking at night in dark clothes.\nStat:\n75 percent of teen pedestrian deaths occur between 7pm and 7am, when it's dark out.\nTip:\nBe especially alert when it's dark out, and make sure drivers can see you.\n# 4\nNot watching out for careless drivers.\nStat:\nMore than 1 in 5 pedestrian deaths happens at an intersection.\nTip:\nLook left, right, left before crossing and continue looking in all directions while crossing.\n# 5\nWalking in the road.\nStat:\nSidewalks can reduce pedestrian crashes by almost 90%.\nTip:\nIt's always best to walk on sidewalks or paths. No sidewalk? Walk facing traffic as far away from vehicles as possible.\n# 6\nNot watching out for cars that are backing up.\nStat:\nNearly 100 kids are killed by cars backing up every year.\nTip:\nWatch out for cars backing up in parking lots and driveways.\n# 7\nNot paying attention to the second car.\nThe first car stops for the pedestrian in the crosswalk. The following car doesn't see why the car in front has stopped, so it zips around and hits the pedestrian.\nStat:\nMore than 80 percent of pedestrians die when hit by vehicles traveling at 40 mph or faster. Less than 10 percent die when hit at 20 mph or less.\nTip:\nPause at each lane of traffic and make eye contact with the drivers.\nAbout Safe Kids Worldwide\nSafe Kids Worldwide is a nonprofit organization working to prevent childhood injury, the number one cause of death for children in the United States .
