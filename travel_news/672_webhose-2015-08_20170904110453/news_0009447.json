First Six Months of 2015\nRevenue of RMB1,379.7 million ( US$222.5 million ) compared with RMB1,855.8 million in the first six months of 2014; Gross margin of 13.9%; Net loss and total comprehensive loss for the period was RMB13.3 million ( US$2.1 million ) with loss per ADS of RMB0.26 (US$0.04) ; Net cash flow from operations was RMB163.6 million ( US$26.4 million ); Bank balances and cash and fixed bank deposits with maturity period over three months totaled RMB974.2 million ( US$157.1 million ). Mr. Junqiu Gao, Deputy CEO and Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of Zenix Auto, commented, \" China's GDP growth slowed to 7.0% in the first half of 2015 as investment in infrastructure and real estate remained tepid. As a result, trucks unit sales slumped 16.8% year-over-year, which negatively impacted our sales for the period. Amid a particularly challenging market environment, we continued to adjust product pricing to gain additional market share. Our unit sales in the OEM market were down 17.3% year-over-year while unit sales in the heavy-duty trucks market were down 31.1% from last year. Our unit sales in the aftermarket were down 13.3% year-over-year while unit sales in the overseas market increased by 6.3%.\"\nMr. Martin Cheung , CFO of Zenix Auto, commented, \"In the first six months of 2015, we generated positive cash flow from operations of RMB163.6 million ( US$26.4 million ) and continued to increase our cash balance. The current stock price does not reflect the strength of our cash generating capability, our solid balance sheet and our leadership in China's commercial vehicle wheel market.\"\n2015 Second Quarter Results\nRevenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 , was RMB657.4 million ( US$106.0 million ) compared with RMB959.7 million for the second quarter of 2014.\nAftermarket sales in China decreased by 36.3% year-over-year to RMB300.3 million ( US$48.4 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 compared with RMB471.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year sales decline in the second quarter of 2015 was mainly attributable to pricing and volume decreases as a result of slowing aftermarket demand.\nSales to the Chinese OEM market decreased by 33.5% year-over-year to RMB226.5 million ( US$36.5 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 compared with RMB340.7 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year sales decrease in the second quarter of 2015 was mainly attributable to lower truck sales and pricing decrease.\nInternational sales decreased by 11.6% year-over-year to RMB130.6 million ( US$21.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 compared with RMB147.7 million in the second quarter of 2014. The year-over-year sales decrease in the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to lower selling prices despite higher unit sales as a result of depreciating RMB and competitive pricing.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, domestic aftermarket sales, domestic OEM sales and international sales contributed 45.7%, 34.4% and 19.9% of revenue, respectively.\nTubed steel wheel sales accounted for 57.6% of 2015 second quarter revenue compared with 58.3% in the same quarter of 2014.

Gross margin was 14.0% compared with 20.0% in the second quarter of 2014, but up from 13.7% in the first quarter of 2015. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was mainly attributable to lower selling prices for wheels that outpaced the decline in raw material costs.\nSelling and distribution costs decreased by 11.3% year-over-year to RMB62.3 million ( US$10.0 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 compared with RMB70.2 million in the second quarter of 2014.
