Visitors should expect to get to the Olympics venues with efficient transportation, hotels of the outmost quality, safety and of course, Rio's well-known hospitality. \"Rio de Janeiro is a city that connects people. It will be a great experience for those who come and everyone will once again be very impressed,\" said the Mr. Lummertz. \nThe Today Show filmed the main sights of the state capital, such as Corcovado, Sugar Loaf, Maracana Stadium (night shot with Natalie) and the beaches of the South Zone of Rio. The infrastructure works for the Games were also filmed and highlighted during the broadcast. \nDuring a live segment, from Copacabana beach, the president of Embratur invited tourists worldwide to visit Brazil in 2016. \"We are prepared to make the best Olympics ever. Everyone should come. See you next year!\" said Lummertz, toasting with Natalie Morales.
