Hazel has flown from South Carolina to Boston seven times so far to treat her Critical Aortic Stenosis.\nHazel’s family was among many who expressed their appreciation for the charity.”We feel so blessed to be able to help close the gap between a desperately ill child and life-saving treatments,” said founder and National President Ann McGee. “The appreciation our families show is what motivates us to continuing flying for their lives.”\nOther exciting news within the organization includes an acknowledgement by local government officials recognizing three decades of community service. The Clark County Board of Commissioners in Las Vegas, NV proclaimed July 2015 as the “Month of Miracles” in honor of the nation’s leading medical flight organization.\nSource:-Miracle Flights", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T04:10:41.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
