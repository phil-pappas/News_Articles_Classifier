Members of Asia Miles will enjoy greater benefits when booking amazing travel experiences through Klook – and are being treated to a special offer to celebrate the kick­off of this exciting collaboration. \nThrough the dedicated website page on Klook, Asia Miles members are just a few clicks away from redeeming a selection of exciting activities hand­picked by Klook – from the adrenaline rush of bungee jumping off Macau Tower to immersing yourself in the fantasy movie world at Universal Studios Singapore, Klook is revolutionising the travel activities market by making these experiences easy to plan into an itinerary – whether it's pre­departure or on the road – through the user­friendly Klook website or iOS/Android app, which offers a meticulously curated choice of activities, exclusive deals and instant paperless ticketing. \nAsia Miles believes that the enthusiasm and travel­related backgrounds of Klook’s co­founders and the rapid acceptance of the idea in the market will bring more unique and innovative travel experiences to members. Former bankers Eric Gnock Fah and Ethan Lin have extensive experience in the consumer, tourism and hospitality sector. Together with the expertise of tech engineer Bernie Xiong, this new startup has more than doubled its team size, while the user base has reached over 300,000, with bookings growing 10 times since its launch in September 2014. This impressive performance led to it winning at the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2015: Best ICT Startup (Consumer Market) Award and WIT Japan & North Asia Start­Up Pitch 2015. \nTo mark the new partnership of Asia Miles and Klook, a limited period promotion will be running from now till 17 August, Asia Miles members from worldwide can redeem discounted packages with as few as 2,500 Asia Miles, enabling them to use “miles” for going further. These include a trip to witness the breath­taking marine life at S.E.A Aquarium in Singapore, Siam Ocean World in Bangkok and a visit to interact with illusionary art at Hong Kong 3D Museum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:29:02.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
