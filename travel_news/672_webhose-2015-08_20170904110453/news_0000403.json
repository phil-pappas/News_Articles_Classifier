A lot of them are from people in TV - they’re looking for someone they can trust.” \nShe said the idea of starting a travel business was born last year while the couple were on holiday. The couple already owned a business selling office furniture and have a property development business, but Simpkin explained they were looking for something else. \nPenrose added: “We’ve taken a lot of holidays together and we were sitting on the beach in Dubai last year when we decided to set up our own travel business. We’d never sold travel before, but travelling is in my blood and we both have the knowledge. \n“We’re so well travelled, we’re always away. We’ve had so many holidays with the kids, so we know where to recommend and what the kids’ clubs are like. I used to use a travel agent myself to book our holidays - I know how important it is to have a friendly voice on the end of the line that you can trust.” \nThe couple don’t have a shop on the high street but operate a website - simplyluxurytravel.co.uk - and invite high-profile clients to their offices in a barn conversion they developed where they live in Cheshire. “We have all the brochures here, and clients can come to us and we give them champagne. It’s nice for them to have some privacy - we do a lot of face-to-face bookings here,” Simpkin said. \n“We have a lot of footballers [come to us], especially from Manchester United, and a lot of the Emmerdale and Coronation Street cast. A lot of our clients have passed our name on - it’s been a great start.” \nIndeed, Simpkin said he had turned to a Worldchoice branch in Sheffield to help with issuing tickets and providing quotes to help with the enquiries. \nMeanwhile, Penrose is keen to point out that she has not swapped careers altogether. “I’ve definitely not stopped acting. I do still keep getting offered work, but it would often take me away from home. If there was something local, that would be great. I haven’t hung up my boots just yet,” she said. \nIn the meantime, Penrose revealed that she is using her acting experience to create unique holiday packages. “We’ve put together a Heartbeat tour in October - we’ll take customers to Whitby and Goathland on a steam train and take them around the set where we used to film,” she said. \n“We’re paying commission to other travel agents to sell it as well - there’s still places left to book.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:53:24.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
