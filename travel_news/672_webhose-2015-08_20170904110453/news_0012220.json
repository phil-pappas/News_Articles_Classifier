A master plan commissioned by the city of Austin and presented to its Economic Opportunity Commission on Monday calls for a five-block expansion of the Capital City’s convention center, and the price tag for the project could approach $600 million, according to the Austin American Statesman. If Austin officials approve the plan, which could include a high-rise hotel and a three-block-long rooftop park, the convention center’s meeting space would double, according to an Austin Monitor report. That would allow Austin to chase after larger conventions and more events that might otherwise come to San Antonio. “We do see them as a potential threat,” San Antonio Convention & Visitors Bureau Executive Director Casandra Matej told me more than two years ago. The threat level could escalate as Austin pursues more investment in and expansion of its visitor industry infrastructure. San Antonio is investing about $325 million to expand the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center , and work on that project is slated to wrap up next year. Once the project is completed, the Alamo City facility will house approximately 800,000 square feet of new space, including more than 500,000 square feet of prime, contiguous exhibit space. John Clamp , executive director of the San Antonio Hotel & Lodging Association , said Alamo City leaders have supported other investments aimed at keeping the market among the more popular visitor destinations — including River Walk improvements and the redevelopment of Hemisfair. Yet the former City Council member believes San Antonio must be more vigilant. “Austin is clearly catching up,” said Clamp about the Capital City’s efforts to close the gap with San Antonio in an industry that pumps more than $13 billion into the local economy annually. “The potential Austin plans underscore the importance of the competitive leisure and group markets in Texas,” Clamp told me. “Austin is and will continue to be a major competitor to San Antonio.” While Austin has continued to build up its hotel room inventory, the city has also been aggressive in its pursuit of more direct flights. Those two factors alone will help Austin attract more conventions and visitors. In fact, more than 10.7 million passengers flew into or out of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in 2014. By comparison, San Antonio International Airport handled about 8.4 million passengers last year. “People go to Austin because they can catch nonstops they can’t get here,” San Antonio City Councilman Joe Krier said. \nGet San Antonio  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T03:18:17.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
