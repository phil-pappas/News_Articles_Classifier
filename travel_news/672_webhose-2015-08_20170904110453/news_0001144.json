Subscribe now to \nAlready a subscriber? Sign In Here One of Orange County’s biggest mortgages — a bit more than $1 billion — belongs to the 2 million-square-feet-plus Orange County Convention Center on International Drive. The convention center — a prime engine for business- and leisure-related travel to Orlando — never really has ceased to be under construction. Its projects have ranged from a $40 million-plus renovation of a wing to seasonal upgrades and maintenance needed to keep convention planners happy to bring their mega meetings back to Central Florida. The convention center’s funding comes from the so-called tourist development tax that hotels placed on themselves years ago to help build a pot of money for marketing, improving the tourism area’s infrastructure and other means that help boost visitation. It’s why sources have told Orlando Business Journal they are anxious to see how soon the convention center mortgage will be paid off, because it could free up county funds that could be used to further develop the tourism area — and ultimately bring more tourists. Here, Orange County Comptroller Martha Haynie clears the air on the convention center’s situation and where that money eventually could be used: How much debt is left on the convention center? At the end of our last fiscal year we still had $1.3 billion outstanding on the center. And the county’s annual debt service is about $72 million. Once that mortgage is paid off, will that money be up for grabs? Not exactly. We don’t know yet what would be tourist development tax-eligible for that money. Plus, the county is doing a master plan for the convention center entertainment district to make it more walkable. Those are big ideas in the immediate area of the convention center that may be in play for this funding. Could there be any other use for that funding? First you have to consider we are playing catch up with this ongoing $186 million renovation project right now. And then there’s all kinds of things that we hear convention center clients wanting to see at the convention center — like significantly upgraded technology. So that has to be addressed. If you had to make the call, where would any new money go ? after that convention center mortgage is paid off? My expectation would be that by the time we have more money — say in 2025 — the county will determine there’s one place that money will go — back into that same building we have been taking care of for years.
