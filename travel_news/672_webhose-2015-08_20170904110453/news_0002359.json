The FAA says Shuttle America 5911 reported the device off the left side of the aircraft as it approached the runway around 6 p.m. on Sunday. The flight originated in Richmond, Virginia. On Friday, Delta Flight 407 was about 1,400 feet off the ground when its pilot spotted an unmanned aircraft. Both planes landed safely. FAA rules don't permit unmanned objects above 400 feet. Sen. Charles Schumer called on the FAA to implement so-called geofencing. He says it would enable drone makers to program the devices to be unable to fly within 2 miles of any airport, above 500 feet and near any sensitive positions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T01:15:58.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
