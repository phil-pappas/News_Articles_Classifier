Food for thought! One-fifth of Brits admit that local... Passenger sneaked cat into the UK from Greece by hiding it... 'I want to wave at my boss from the bar': The most hilarious... Today a cordoned-off area of Terminal 5 was packed with hundreds of suitcases which Heathrow staff was forced to shift manually on trolleys.\nMarcel Maier, 35, travelling to Hamburg, said: 'The queues are long and chaotic, but I've just had to leave my baggage with the staff and hope that it arrives.\n'I am not confident it will arrive today, the airport isn't sure either, so that is definitely going to cause me frustration.\n'People are really frustrated, and it's crazy just looking at the piles and piles of bags everywhere.'\nIt was an uncertain time for those waiting in Terminal 5, not knowing if their luggage would follow them onto the plane (file photo)\nJames Bardolph, 30, travelling to Dusseldorf, said: 'British Airways had to get out a concertina wall on wheels to collect bags next to the check in.\n'My luggage carousel had all three bags on it, and I am not sure if anything else is coming out.\n'I am going to Dusseldorf to do a broadcast, and that bag has critical equipment in it. I might have to fly more colleagues out to get the equipment over there.'\nHeathrow announced that the power outage, caused by their supplier, was resolved around 10am. Airport bosses said said staff were doing their best to deal with the delays.\nPassengers were quick to criticise after a power cut caused the worst possible start to their trips\nBut many passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration, and even posted pictures of the mountains of unattended bags.\nGerry Rowe said: 'No luggage still from Amsterdam flight. Does Heathrow airport ever work?\n'Waiting for your luggage takes longer than your flight, customer services at Heathrow are terrible.'\nAllan Clark said: 'It just gets worse as my bag didn't make the flight. Thanks, another rubbish trip with BA.'\nTwitter user t@tillypayne wrote that half of the passengers' luggage had not reached the destination\nLaura Dale took to Twitter to warn fellow travellers.\nShe said: 'Anyone flying from Heathrow Terminal 5 today take just hand luggage. A power cut is causing hold cases not reaching flights.\n'That said I've had at least 4 friends lose their luggage, so my warning remains.'\nTamara Rowe said: 'T5 chaos huge queues and staff in absolutely no hurry at security.'\nPorter Anderson: 'Bags not flying today!'\nEmma Shevah said: 'Conveyor belts not working causes chaos at @HeathrowAirport Teminal 5 this morning. I have a feeling we may never see our cases again.'\nA Heathrow spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'This morning Terminal 5 suffered a loss of power due to an issue with our supplier. Power has now been restored, however the baggage system was impacted for a number of hours.\n'We apologise to passengers affected and we are working hard to ensure that they are reunited with their bags as quickly as possible. Flights are continuing to operate as normal.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1KO0tid"], "published": "2015-08-04T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:28:49.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
