After a sunny opening weekend, it was cold and wet for most of the rest of the time. Even the wind refused to play ball for much of the week, with sailing abandoned entirely on Tuesday. It may have contributed to an impression, from without anyway, that the week was something of a damp squib. That is assuming anyone noticed it was going on at all, of course. Where once Cowes Week was part of the fabric of the British sporting social scene - tucked in with Royal Ascot, the Boat Race, Wimbledon, Henley Regatta and the motor racing at Brooklands (whose slogan 'the right crowd and no crowding' summed up the exclusive nature of these social gatherings) - there is a sense, certainly in some quarters, that one of the oldest regattas in the world, the highlight of the British yachting scene, has lost some of its lustre. Gone are the days when Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia would motor grandly into Cowes and dwarf the dinghies; when the Duke of Edinburgh would sail his Yeoman class yacht in the regatta . Zara Phillips, the 16th in line to the throne, did take part in the Artemis Challenge, a round the island race sponsored by the UK fund manager, on Thursday. But it was an understated appearance. Cowes Week has not been blessed with the best of weather. And there is nothing wrong with any of that. Cowes Week has evolved. It is more egalitarian now. And the good news is that it is holding its own. More than 800 boats entered this year which is a healthy number, certainly compared with other big regattas such as Cork Week or Key West Race Week in Florida, both of which have seen entries drop dramatically. Matt Sheahan, the racing and technical editor of Yachting World, believes Cowes is in excellent shape all things considered. And he would know. \"I've been to every one since 1975 I think,\" he said. \"I don't think it has fallen on hard times. I'd argue quite the opposite in fact. Yes we used to have the Britannia but Cowes is still absolutely unique. It has evolved but stayed true to its roots at the same time. The Cowes Combined Clubs [the 10 clubs helping to run the event with around 600 volunteers] do an amazing job in that respect. \"No other regatta in the world has the depth and variety that Cowes has... squibs, dinghy-style keelboats all the way up to the Maxi yachts. And every class has a decent fleet.\" \"Cowes Week has evolved. It is more egalitarian now.\" Sheahan has a vested interest, perhaps. But he has a point when he says that Cowes is unique. At what other event in the world can grassroots competitors rub shoulders with the world's best? Can fathers and sons compete on the same stretch of water, and at the same time, as some of the most technically advanced boats in the world? Boats such as Musandam, the MOD70 trimaran and the flagship of Oman Sail, or Comanche, the stunning new 100ft super-maxi yacht, both of which have been blasting around the Solent this week in anticipation of the Fastnet race. Cowes Week - and sailing in general - faces a constant challenge in a very competitive marketplace. And it is not getting any easier. Stuart Quarrie is stepping down as event director after 17 years while Aberdeen Asset Management's five-year sponsorship term comes to an end this year, leaving the regatta, which was first held in 1826, without a title sponsor. But it will find a way. Cowes Week may seem an anachronism. Is it a sporting event? A leisure event? A chance for professional sailors to hobnob with corporates and celebrities? It is all of those things; part of our sporting and cultural heritage and vital for sailing in this country. Last night's traditional end-of-week fireworks display may have taken place in cold, wet conditions but they still capped a glorious, unique week.
