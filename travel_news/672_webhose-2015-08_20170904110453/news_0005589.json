Many of these events fall during the softer fall months, reducing the seasonality of the tourism sector. They also utilize the services of several ancillary tourism players including entertainers, equipment rental companies, app developers, meeting stand developers, etc. \nMarilyn McHugh, vice president of global events at Questex Travel Group, joined Roach in making the announcement at this year's sold-out event, which is underway at the all-inclusive Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. \nMcHugh stated that Barbados is known for its gracious and hospitable people, world-class beaches and fine-dining restaurants. \"Barbados truly will be an exciting destination for our incentive travel buyers and suppliers,\" she said. \"We couldn't be happier to share this news.\" \n\"Hosting 165 of the top U.S buyers on the island lends us the perfect platform to showcase the renowned hospitality, sights and sounds that Barbados has to offer.‚Äù Roach stated. \n\"We are absolutely thrilled at the confidence invested in us by Questex in choosing Barbados as host destination for CMITE in 2016. Thanks to additional service by Delta and JetBlue airlines and newly opened resorts, now is the perfect time for the travel industry to reacquaint itself with Barbados.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T14:27:02.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
