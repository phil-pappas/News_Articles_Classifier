The new functionalities enable corporations to provide increased personalisation and a better user experience to business travellers by offering smarter search options with more comprehensive flight and service information. \nAmadeus e-Travel Management (AeTM) is a flexible online booking solution which allows corporations to maintain control of their corporate travel programmes by integrating company travel policies, preferred suppliers and negotiated rates into an easy to use website. The platform enables employees to easily plan,book and purchase complete travel itineraries that automatically adhere to their company’s travel policy guidelines. Amadeus e-Travel Management version 18.1 delivers: · Smart Search – using an integrated business intelligence logic, AeTM displays search results for full service and low cost carriers[1] that have been processed by a unique algorithm. It analyses not only the lowest fares, but other key decision factors such the traveller’s personal search history and an overall comfort rating. This makes it easier to find the most relevant air recommendation for them. · Fare Family Names and Descriptions – increases transparency by displaying services that are included or excluded for a given fare. This assists travel arrangers and travellers in identifying fares with preferred services and discard those with services that aren’t valued. It also facilitates easier comparison between airline offers, thereby helping the corporation obtain the best value in the most efficient manner possible. This information also enables airlines to differentiate their product and service offering and widen the focus from price to customer experience. · Baggage Allowance Indicator – outlines baggage information for each fare during the shopping process. This also enables travellers to take advantage of hand baggage only fares where applicable. Providing this information early in the research and shopping process helps travellers andbookers find the right fare faster and make meaningful comparisons that lead to a more informed decision. · New Integrated Partner: MyCab – Amadeus is adding MyCab to its integrated partner framework of service providers to deliver integrated taxi booking solutions available in 143 destinations and 61 countries. “We are continuously developing our technology to meet the ever changing needs of corporate travellers and travel bookers. This latest release of Amadeus e-Travel Management delivers new capabilities that enhance the user experience through richer and highly relevant information that enables better informed decision-making. In this and otherways, Amadeus continues to provide corporations with flexibility and control over their business travel programme and expenditure,” said Simon Taylor, Business Line Manager, Amadeus UK & Ireland.
