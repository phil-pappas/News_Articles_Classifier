Too often, investors wind up with too much overlap, holding several large-cap funds or only value funds. That’s basically committing to the run, or the long bomb; when the defense is stacked up against your strength, you’re not going anywhere.\n• How you want to play defense: For most investors, bond funds are the defensive play, so seeing how they could play now — as bond funds tend to react negatively to rate increases, at least initially — is important.\nInvestors have been focused on defense ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and now have portfolios that are often heavier into bonds than expected.\nThe opponent of your defense is the economy, interest rates and the market, and with an increase in rates, bond funds will face new challenges.\nThis is where an investor who is worried about a market downturn can add options, whether that is income-oriented stock funds, corporates, junk or convertible-securities funds, bear-market funds, and more, hoping to further diversify and make the defense more flexible.\n• Focus on special teams: The buzzword in the fund industry for the last few years has been “alternative,” and while that generally refers to asset classes beyond stocks, bonds and cash, it has become parlance for specialized funds using complex hedge-fund strategies trying to make money in all market conditions.\nAlt funds are not a “must,” in an average investor’s fund portfolio, but for anyone who has a solid offense and stalwart defense, the third-phase of the game can help to improve overall performance. Decide how important you want this to be in your planning.\n• Game-planning: This is where current market conditions, plus your time horizon and risk tolerances, come most into play.\nYou may simply rebalance the portfolio — culling winners and putting your portfolio back onto plan — if you’re confident the strategy will continue working, or you could change allocations based on market conditions or personal changes, like making the portfolio more conservative as you age rather than sticking with the approach you used when first putting together a few decades ago.\nHow do you upgrade the team? Unlike pro sports teams, it’s easy to make trades for your fund team. If you believe there’s a better option out there — or that you are paying opportunity costs by investing in a mediocre fund or a laggard — you can make a swap.\nThat said, be sure to examine any applicable tax costs before making a move. You’re not improving your overall portfolio if the upgrade to your portfolio can’t also recoup any taxes you have to pay in short order.\nArmed with a new and/or confirmed roster of players, it’s game on. You should be ready for whatever the market dishes out next.\nChuck Jaffe is senior columnist for MarketWatch. He can be reached at cjaffe@marketwatch.com or at P.O.
