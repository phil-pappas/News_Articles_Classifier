Deciding to do one is easy , but picking a destination is more difficult — what with a long list of magnificent countries to choose from. To help, here’s a handy overview of when to go, what you’ll see and where to stay.\nAcross the board in Africa, August through October is prime safari season. While there are never any guarantees with wildlife, this timeframe is when you’re most likely to see most species – it’s the dry and everybody’s mingling around waterholes. But let’s take it country-by-country, and hone in on some of the highest rated lodges, because, hey, on the off chance you don’t catch a glimpse of your fave creature, a comfy bed, big bath and fine dining can relieve any disappointment. Most are all-inclusive so that makes things extra easy.Northern Botswana is the hot spot for elephants, and a boat cruise down the Chobe River is a great way to see them. The abundant Okavango Delta is home to big cats, wild dogs and birds galore. Meerkat lovers should head to Makgadikgadi Pans. That area gets busy with migrating zebras, and in turn predators, come December.\nAbu Camp offers elephant-back safaris — a unique way to see the rich Okavango Delta region. The tent accommodations feel at one with nature while still being really, really ridiculously luxurious.Savute Elephant Camp in Chobe National Park is for those who’d rather just watch those largest of land animals — they’re known to just amble by. Right on the river, it draws a lot of thirsty beasts.\nSan Camp is another tented oasis, one that makes guests feel like the region’s original explorers, albeit cushier. Its place on the edge of the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans provides easy access to meerkat territory.\nSource:-APTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T05:12:07.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
