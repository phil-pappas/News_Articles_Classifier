This will be a rare occasion for residents and an opportunity for tourists to see the Holy Father. \nDetails regarding the Holy Father’s journey during his historical visit to Uganda shows that he wishes as much as possible to engage with ordinary Christians in Uganda without the pomp of a lavish reception, dinner, luxury vehicles, and accommodation, the “Munno Voice,” a weekly publication of the Archdiocese of Kampala, reported. \nWhile modalities of the government of Uganda and the Papal Nuncio are awaited, this is by no means the final program of what the Pope’s schedule will be, although it is expected that he will lead a holy mass at the Uganda Martyrs Shrine in Namugongo, where Christians were martyred and cannonized by Pope Paul VI in 1969. \nThis will be the highlight of the Pontiff’s visit where people from all walks of life shall be given the opportunity to see and hear the Holy Father. \nOther engagements shall be restricted to certain categories of people including: \n• Meeting youth at Kololo Independence Grounds \n• Meeting catechists at Munyonyo Martyrs Shrine \n• Meeting priests and religious leaders at Lubaga Cathederal in Kampala \n• And a visit to Mapeera Baketeyamba’s home for the vulnerable in Nalukolongo outside Kampala \nHe will also have a brief discussion with President Yoweri Museveni strictly on religious matters. \nPope Francis’ visit to Uganda is special in the sense that it will be his first time in Africa. What is more, it will be the first time an African country is hosting a Pope on three occasions, the first being Pope Paul VI in 1969 and Pope John Paul II in 1993. \nThe all steel Namugongo Martyrs Shrine is a magnet to several million pilgrims from several countries across the region and continent every June 3, commemorating their martyrdom in 1886.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:25:05.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
