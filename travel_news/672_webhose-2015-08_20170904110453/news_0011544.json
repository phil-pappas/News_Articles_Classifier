ResponsibleOhio isn't happy about the ballot language for its marijuana legalization push so it's taking the matter to the Ohio Supreme Court . The group on Thursday asked the court to direct the Ohio Ballot Board and Secretary of State Jon Husted to rewrite the language for its marijuana legalization issue, the Plain Dealer reports . A 40-page complaint says the wording is misleading to voters. The title for Issue 3 has drawn the group's ire because it includes the words “grants a monopoly.” (Issue 3 would permit only 10 pot farms in the state.) Husted, who revealed the titles Tuesday, is a Republican who opposes pot legalization . There's also Issue 2, which is meant to derail the pot plans, and includes the words in its title \"anti-monopoly amendment.\" Legalizing pot could result in a $4.1 billion industry in Ohio by 2020 and create more than 10,000 jobs , ResponsibleOhio says. Clinton visits Kasich’s home turf. Ohio is one of the most important states of them all when it comes to presidential elections and Hillary Clinton finally made her first campaign stop for the 2016 race in the state Thursday with an appearance at Case Western Reserve University. Her speech covered several topics, including gun violence and the GOP’s “extreme views about women,” the Plain Dealer reports . She also made sure to poke Gov. John Kasich while she was here, criticizing him for signing a budget that had an amendment to deny funding to rape-crisis centers that discuss abortion with patients, the report said. “ Hillary Clinton ’s trail of scandal is decades long, and only continues to worsen,” Kasich’s team said in an email to the paper. “Not surprising she thinks the only way for her to compete in Ohio or elsewhere is to launch negative attacks against John Kasich .” Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, already has more than 1,200 volunteers in the state. A new Quinnipiac University poll shows her well ahead of other Democrats and she’d beat Republicans Donald Trump, Jeb Bush and others in the race for the White House. Street scene. I’ve always thought one of the coolest things about living in Columbus is that there are so many interesting neighborhoods to explore. Experience Columbus agrees. The tourism group has come out with a blog about its favorite streets in five local neighborhoods and spots in Clintonville, German Village and Franklinton make the list. You can check it out here. New plans for an iconic brand. We told you earlier this week about the Frisch’s Big Boy restaurant chain being taken private in a $174.5 million deal . The Cincinnati-based business now is owned by private equity firm NRD Partners I LP out of Atlanta and will be delisted Sept. 4 from the New York Stock Exchange. Our sister paper the Cincinnati Business Courier talked to Frisch’s new owner who has big plans for the Big Boy brand including putting “on the menu things the customers want.” Better beverage options and even appetizers could be in the mix under the new owner. \nGet Columbus Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:27:20.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
