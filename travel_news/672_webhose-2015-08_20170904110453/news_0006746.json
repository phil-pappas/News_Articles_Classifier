We have two examples today. Firstly an article on page 8 on the lesson from the fighting in the Vosges carried the headline “Importance of Shells.” Given the push for munitions over the last few months you’d think everybody was aware of their importance! Then on page 9 we have the latest returns from the Registrar-General. Whilst the report reports on the sharp decline in the birth rate (which perhaps isn’t surprising given conceptions for this quarter would have coincided with the start of the war) there is also a headline about an “Increase in mortality.” Hardly unexpected in wartime you would have thought… Also in today’s paper - The case of the imposter sergeant (see August 12) sees another woman identify him as her husband – page 5 - Philip Gibbs writes about “The Germ Seekers” – page 6 - The Germans claim the capture of Kovo, but “this claim … is not borne out in its entirety in last night’s Russian communiqué” – page 7 - Another Zeppelin raid ( page 7 ) generates another leader castigating the Germans, which is beginning to get a bit repetitive now ( page 6 ). A breach of Dutch neutrality by the airships doesn’t help the Germans’ cause either ( page 7 ) - Another 500 yards is gained in the Dardanelles, at Suvla – page 7 - The secretary of the Early Closing Association has a new argument for his cause in wartime – long hours in shops is deleterious to the health of women brought in to replace men who have fought, as they are not used to it, and this could impact of the health of a future generation ( page 8 ) @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:28:36.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
