There's a band, people bring dinner, and Harvey Cedars police officers can always say the setting sun was in their eyes and they didn't see those beers.\n\"It's our Islamorada,\" said Craig Coddington, president of the High Point Volunteer Fire Company, evoking the Florida Keys sunset as he sat outside the station with two others while the sun cast rays over their faces.\n\"You're never going to get the green flash, though,\" said Paul Rice, another firefighter, referring to the effect that can happen in the Pacific or Gulf of Mexico over the water, a flash of green light just after sunset.\nIt won't happen after an LBI sunset because, as pretty as conditions are - setting over the bay, just past ever-shrinking Wood Island, kayakers, and stand-up paddleboarders gliding back and forth like ice skaters in bathing suits - the sun ultimately sets not over the water but over a little strip of mainland, in this case, Stafford Township.\nThe best Jersey Shore sunsets sometimes appear almost miraculously out of a stormy day, moisture in the air playing host to hot yellows and oranges and purples and reds strewn thickly across the horizon.\nSometimes the sun will hit a cloud bank, dip behind it, and shoot rays upward, like a volcano with pink lava, a cloud vase with an ever-changing bouquet, an Olympic torch.\nHank Rambo, 71, who lives across the street from the Comisos, sees his sunset during the first part of summer line up perfectly with the boats and American flags along the bay street that juts in front of his house. \"Once it starts to go down, it goes quickly,\" he says.\nBob Duddy, 63, prefers the park on non-concert days, with just some walkers, playground kids, people taking note of a bench in memory of Kristen Montanaro, who died in the 9/11 attacks. Some locals prefer October, when it's quieter.\nGary Szatkowski, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, says those LBI back bays offer panoramic sunset views not commonly encountered back home in the suburbs or city.\n\"A lot of times the thunderstorms will get themselves out of the way in time for sunset,\" he said. \"The atmosphere is blocking out blues and greens, leaving reds and oranges. If it's a little hazy, moisture, as there often is during the summer, makes things a little fuzzier.\"\nOne such sunset moved Debra Gaveglio of Washington to create a #funkyharveycedarssunset hashtag on Twitter along with her #thejoyinlife and #withthefam vacation.\nAfter two weeks of rainouts, the local band Facedown finally got to play Bruce Springsteen's \"I'm Goin' Down\" without a trace of irony for the hundreds (some put it at nearly a thousand) gathered one July Wednesday as the sun disappeared over Sunset Park at 8:18 p.m.\nIn truth, that sunset fizzled at the end as it slipped behind a low cloud bank. But then, out of nowhere, it sent fantastically outstretched purplish rays spreading far into the sky 10 minutes after sunset.\n\"Did you see it after the sun went down?\" Comiso enthused the next day, another sunset under her family's Texan Jersey belt. \"That pink-and-purple sky. Sometimes, the after-effects hang on so long. If it's not a spectacular sunset, you just wait - you never know what you'll get.\"\nAt Sunset Park, Kimberly Hollander had stood with friends at water's edge, waiting for her moment for the photos she posts nearly every sunset on Facebook. She knows how at the end, you've got to keep your eyes peeled. Or it's going, going, gone - slipped into the Manahawkin envelope.\n\"You take a second off of it, it's a totally different perspective,\" she said. She says it rivals Costa Rica.\nAs usual, people kayaked and paddleboarded (a local surf shop sets up in Harvey Cedars and in two other towns with concerts on other nights). A group of boats docked all together not far from shore. People danced in an all-ages scrum.\nJessica Florio, 41, a waitress, took a sunset selfie with her stepdaughter Grace Parker, 11, and friend Sharon Graverson, and returned to sit on their blanket, a peaceful evening basking in the sunlight. She'd been long hoping to be able to get to a Wednesday concert with loved ones, and having done so meant a lot in those moments.\nOn 79th, Comiso moved from the steamers to a main course of steak (they live Texas, but summer on LBI in a house her parents bought for $5,000 after the March 1962 storm put it on its side.) Because the kids do the dishes, nobody moved when the sun went down.\n\"You have to not take it for granted,\" she said. \"It's different every night, never the same. You say, 'I'm going to remember this sunset.' Then the next one comes along and you can't remember that other one.\"\nHer 16-year-old granddaughter, Paige, settled into a nearby chair. \"I've just always grown up watching it every summer,\" she said. \"You can't miss it, really.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T10:50:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
