In particular Jetstar Japan where the group was planning to open another 12,000 sales kiosks.\nThe kiosks are located in convenience stores across Japan, because that is where people are comfortable in buying an air ticket, she said.\nJetstar Japan’s mascot Jetta had also struck a chord with the local market, attracting more than nine million followers on social media.\n“We’re looking at the market through the eyes of our customers,” Ms Hrdlicka said.\nIn the coming year, Jetstar would completely overhaul its website but not as a result of criticism from consumer groups about sneaky cost add-ons and extras.\nMs Hrdlicka said the redesign had been two years in the planning and would make the site much more consumer friendly.\n“None of us would enjoy the experience (as it stands). It just takes too long, and is too cumbersome,” she said.\n“It doesn’t give us the ability to create fast and effective purchasing by customers online.”\nThe new look site would allow travellers to customise their journey from beginning to end and get the best deals on everything from parking at the airport to hire cars and hotels.\nIncrease Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
