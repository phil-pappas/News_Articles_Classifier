She attended award shows with her mother and father, walked red carpets with them and sang in Central Park with Houston as adoring fans watched.\nBut the 22-year-old woman whose parents freely shared her childhood with the public will be remembered in a private service, whose details have been closely guarded by the Brown and Houston families, their attorneys and their friends, including filmmaker Tyler Perry .\nFILE - In this Feb. 12, 2011, file photo, singer Whitney Houston, left, and daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown arrive at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif.

(AP Photo/Dan Steinberg, File) Media reports indicate the funeral will be at 11 a.m. Saturday at St. James United Methodist Church in Alpharetta, just north of Atlanta .\nBobbi Kristina, who dreamed of growing up to achieve fame like her mother, died in hospice care July 26, about six months after she was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in her suburban Atlanta townhome. For Houston fans, the scene was grimly similar to the way her megastar mother had died three years earlier.\nShe was found in the townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, an orphan three years older, whom Houston had raised as her own. Bobbi Kristina referred to him as her husband. A police report earlier this year described the incident as a drowning, and authorities are investigating her death.\nIn a statement after her death, Brown said the family must find a way to honor his daughter's memory.\n\"Krissy was and is an angel,\" he said. \"I am completely numb at this time. My family must find a way to live with her in spirit and honor her memory. Our loss is unimaginable.\"\nBobbi Kristina was the sole heir of her mother's estate. She identified herself on Twitter as \"Daughter of Queen WH,\" ''Entertainer/Actress\" with William Morris & Co., and \"LAST of a dying breed.\" She told Oprah Winfrey shortly after her mother's death in 2012 that she wanted to carry on Houston's legacy by singing, acting and dancing. But her career never took off.\nIn her short life, Bobbi Christina became a social media sensation, sending more than 11,000 tweets and attracting 164,000 followers.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/08/01/0e/12/ef0e7f95f01642dcadacaeec0560bfb6-1929644ed5a247c5a0fa4deae7d88211-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-01T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T12:31:20.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
