Well, some less anxiously than others, given that many top universities handed out unconditional offers in a scramble to fill their courses, now government rules have removed the cap on student numbers. Rising tuition fees (now £9,000 a year) clearly haven’t discouraged applications, which reached a record high this year, according to admissions body UCAS, but there will be fewer places available through clearing for those who don’t do as well as they’d hoped. Many institutions are bracing themselves for a record-breaking panic , as thousands of students who had been planning to take a gap year are thinking again, thanks to Chancellor George Osborne’s decision to scrap maintenance grants from September 2016 (which would add an estimated additional £13,000 to their debt on graduation.) So, will it all be worth it? Who better to ask than the latest generation of graduates, who have just picked up their degree certificates and are now scrambling to secure their place in the real world. Although the number of graduate vacancies this year is expected to be 12 per cent higher than last year (according to an Association of Graduate Recruiters survey), almost a third of employers say some jobs go unfilled because candidates lack the required skills - and an ONS report last year showed that 47 per cent of graduates employed within six months were working in jobs that did not require a degree. Which might leave some graduates wondering how useful those years of study actually were. Then there’s the escalating cost of renting - which has increased by more than 10 per cent since last summer - coupled with the mountain of debt that, for many, will prove a long-lasting university hangover. A Sutton Trust study last year revealed that three-quarters will still be repaying student loans into their 50s . We will be tracking the journeys of four new graduates over the coming months as they navigate their way through the excitement and uncertainty of post-university life, taking their initial tentative steps on the long career path ahead. Here, in our first instalment in the series, we introduce the class of 2015. How will they get on? Liana Maher, 24, from Aldershot, Hants, studied English and American Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London Liana says: “I had mixed emotions about graduating. I loved studying and loved my university, so was really sad it was all over. But there was also a sense of relief as the last couple of months were so stressful and exhausting with finals. After it was all over, my flatmates and I went for lunch and said: “So, what do we do now?” I answered this question with a two-week holiday to Chile, initially, but now I’m back in London doing a stop-gap job in a shop in Sloane Square. I’m about to hand back the keys to my student flat in New Cross, south east London, and the house and job-hunting has begun in earnest. I’d love to work in literary publishing, so for the past year I’ve done unpaid work experience on and off as a PA for a woman who runs who runs a literature festival and events. I feel lucky I’ve always known what I want to do and been driven, but there’s a lot of pressure, all round. Older generations just got a job and bought a house and it was that simple, but that’s not necessarily true for our generation. I've got £33,000 student debt for a start - although I think of that more like a tax, paying for my education in arrears. My flatmates and I - all girls - are looking for a new place in New Cross but it will be harder finding something this year because everyone’s raised their rents. Our budget is £500 per month each, which is not all that realistic sadly. I am anxious about the future, at the same time it’s quite exciting - there are lots of possibilities. I’m determined to make something interesting of my life and I know I will.” Adam Jordan, 22, from Skegness studied Arabic and Oriental Studies at Pembroke College, Oxford Adam says: “Going from a small town like Skegness to Oxford was amazing, but by the end of my four-year course I was glad to move on to pastures new. When you’re there, you hear of other students who’ve landed brilliant jobs already and you panic, “why don’t I have anything lined up?” The pressure’s intense. I knew I wanted to work in the Middle East, and had been thinking about law for a while because it seems like a stable career. An opportunity presented itself quite recently: I was chatting to someone at a conference in London who happened to be a lawyer at a Qatari firm called Al Tamimi. I told him I was interested and here I am in Qatar - two weeks into an internship, renting a room with a friend of my brother’s. It’s a paid trial period, so if they like me they might hire me. I wouldn’t want to stay out here forever, but British graduates are in high demand and it’s a good quality of life - and tax-free. I’m feeling pretty positive about everything, but I started my course in 2011, the last year before tuition fees tripled to £9000, which would definitely have made me think twice. It worries me that we’re going down the American route, where universities become businesses and students their cash machines. I would tell this year’s A-level students not be pressured into going if they have a passion or plan that involves something else. I had a great time, but I think my generation will have it far harder than our parents’, in terms of finding our feet in the real world.” Natasha Tavani, 21, from Brighton studied English at Loughborough University Natasha says: “Loughborough is such a bubble, so it’s been strange transitioning to the real world after the best three years of my life. Especially now that all my friends have shot off in their different directions - I’m very close to my family but the girls I lived with became my family too. Perhaps it’s not surprising it’s felt like a bit of a jolt: I handed in my final essay on a Friday and started a job on the following Monday. I had started applying for jobs about six weeks before I graduated - I wasn’t really thinking about it before then – and was offered this job as an events coordinator at a Leicester venue called The City Rooms two weeks before finishing. I’d been quite open-minded about what I wanted to do but when this opportunity came along I realised it was what I wanted to go into. And I love it to pieces. The change from the slower pace of student life has been quite dramatic and I’ve grown up quite quickly, all in one go. Getting up in the morning is the biggest adjustment I’ve had to make; I love my lie-ins. I’ve moved out of my student house and into a flat in Leicester with my boyfriend of two years, Jeff – another big step, which feels very grown-up. He’s 25 and a personal trainer. There are so many things I’ve never needed to know before but suddenly do, like how do you pay council tax? Who is my water provider? We paid our student landlord an all-inclusive rent to sort all that out for us - now I have to figure it out for myself. I feel very positive about the future though. I have £37,500 student debt, which is daunting if I think about it, but it was beyond worth it. I would pay that money all over again.\" Sammy Kerr, 22, from Kennington, south London studied Politics and French at Bristol University Sammy says: \"I’m in limbo at the moment, while I wait for the next stage of my life to start. After all the fun of university, I’m back home with my parents, which always takes a bit of adjusting to, though I doubt there’ll be civil war - as an only child I’m used to spending time with them. If I’d landed a full-time job on graduating, I’d have considered moving out; I’ve got friends in London with whom I could have enjoyed a more or less hedonistic lifestyle. But I lack the money at the moment - my course was four years, so I’ve got almost £30,000 of student debt, plus a maxed-out overdraft. It’s a gigantic sum of money, but I’m assuming it will get me a career I’m passionate about. I’ll be paying it off in such small increments over so many years, it doesn’t feel like an albatross around my neck. To make a bit of cash I’m working for Manchester United Soccer Schools for now, which involves wearing a Man Utd polo shirt and wandering around Heathrow Airport meeting Mexican boys off planes and putting them into taxis. It’s just a filler job while I apply for other things, like internships at NGOs. I want to get involved in either conflict resolution or news media. I’ve just been offered a job as a contracted in-house telephone fundraiser for Amnesty International, which will hopefully afford me some space to think about what I want to do, and will maybe be a foot in the door for something further. I never had a particular career in mind at university and I still don’t. I just really want to be involved in big, important, helpful things for other people. It may sound cavalier, but I sort of think everything will be fine.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T22:59:56.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
