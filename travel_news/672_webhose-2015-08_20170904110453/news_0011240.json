Rick Neuheisel?\nA blockbuster Times piece last week validated suspicions that the long-dominant, semiprofessional football program at Bellevue High School is rife with booster corruption, questionable recruiting practices and complicity with a wink-wink strip mall diploma mill.\nAll of which has, over the years, prompted district higher-ups — who seemed to be aware of much of it — to shrug, polish the trophies, and mutter to themselves the snide epithet made infamous by Neuheisel, the noted wealthy situational ethicist : “Scoreboard, baby.”\nThe question now is not so much whether the program will take a well-deserved fall, but how many complicit official enablers it will drag into the abyss with it.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time Enjoy the slide, folks. As it turns out, buying a trophy case large enough to live in might have been a good call, after all.\nMore news from the ethics-free zone:\nSome People Saw This Coming: Seriously, all those brawny high-school guys zipping around in letter jackets and Aston Martins might have been a tip-off. But putting their parents on personal service contracts with a strict monthly expense allowance should have been a dead giveaway.\nLooking At the Bright Side: Any Eastside practitioners of ends-justifying-the-means who might lose their jobs can surely find gainful employment at just about any NCAA Division I athletic department, where money, corruption and premium tequila apparently flow more freely than after-hours tears at desks in Amazonia.\nSpeaking of Boozers: They’re serving a new late-summer drink at Montlake-area bars — the Sarkisian Sling. Down two of them, and you’re strongly considering possibly sometime soon exploring potential treatment options.\nWe Kid Sark: But seriously, you’ve gotta feel for yet another person who has fallen victim to mixing alcohol with Stupid Pills.\nMeanwhile, Down in the War Zone: New ground in Orwellian doublespeak was broken at several new jobsites as developer Matt Griffin, justifying the unmitigated, poorly planned skyscrapering of every square inch of South Lake Union, suggested that uncontrolled, view-blocking high-rise construction is good for the little guy because drab, cramped, soulless living conditions equate to lower rents.\nHe Didn’t Stop There: Griffin, like others profiting obscenely from the relentless upchuck of growth, went on to brand as elitists any legacy residents who selfishly seem more concerned with their own well-being than that of people who might come along someday and displace them.\nThink About That: “Let’s willfully blow up our quality of life with the hope that it could, potentially, save 50 bucks a month for whoever stumbles into town later and kicks us to the curb!” Said no one, nowhere, ever.\nConversely: It was refreshing to see an admission that the transportation plan for that part of Seattle is gridlock, which already has been achieved.\nAnd Finally: Mayor pro-tem Ed Murray, D-Velopment, took valuable time from his global, taxpayer-financed vacation junket to remind locals in an op-ed piece that unchecked growth in the Moated City is a great thing, and that he and his crack staff are managing the growth adeptly. “We’re not just sitting on our hands,” wrote the mayor, prompting a flabbergasted Times reader to deadpan: “Well, somebody is sitting on something.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:29:51.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
