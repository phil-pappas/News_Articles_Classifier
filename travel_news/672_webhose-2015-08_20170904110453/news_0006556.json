Almost 40,000 passengers used the airport during the 24 hour period, an increase of 1% over the last record day almost ten years ago to the day, on Friday 12th August 2005.\nOf the 39,256 passengers that used the airport yesterday, the biggest growth sector was seen on long haul routes which increased by 46% compared to ten years ago. This growth has come from the popularity of flag carriers, particularly from the Star Alliance group and the airport’s ability to handle long range aircraft due to its £300m investment over the last decade.\nPaul Kehoe, the Chief Executive of Birmingham Airport, said, “Not only have we had twenty-seven months of continuous growth and seven record months so far this year, we can now celebrate achieving our busiest day since 2005.\n“This is due to many factors, including the significant investment that we have made to improve facilities and increase capacity, plus our strategy to attract a greater range of airlines, routes and passenger that are clearly enjoying the experience that they have at Birmingham. “\nOur offer, and that of the Midlands region in terms of trade and tourism, plus Birmingham’s excellent location and transport links has meant that we have been able to attract some of the world’s largest airlines, including American Airlines, Air France/KLM, Air India, Emirates, Lufthansa, Hainan Airlines, Turkish Airlines and United Airlines and offer passengers and businesses in the region far more connectivity and cargo opportunities.”\nCountries with most growth compared to the previous busiest day included Delhi/Amritsar (+537.1%), Barcelona (+425.7%), Dubai (+268.4%), New York JFK (+100%) and Rome (+130.7%).\nSource:- Birmingham Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T01:15:42.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
