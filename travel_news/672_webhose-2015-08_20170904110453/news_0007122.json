I am sure the winner will be overjoyed at the prospect of winning the golf break of a lifetime.”\nGuy Roberts, director of golf at Donnafugata Golf Resort & SPA , said: “We have been delighted with the response that we received since working with Andy and the rest of the Darren Clarke Golf team.\n“It is a great honour for us to have opened the only Darren Clarke Centre of Excellence in mainland Europe and extending the relationship with the Darren Clarke brand shows the high regard that the Resort is held in across the UK, Ireland and beyond.”\nIt was a great honour for the Resort when we opened the new Darren Clarke Centre of Excellence and we’re delighted to have been given the chance to take the relationship a step further.\n“Winning an event like this is a great achievement and we’re looking forward to welcoming the winners and offering them an experience they will never forget, with the opportunity to use some of the finest new golf facilities in Europe.”\nThirteen-year-old Darren Scott fought off fierce competition in 2014 to claim a luxury holiday for two to Donnafugata, which he plans to take later this year.
