A new exhibit at Düsseldorf’s NRW-Forum explores how human identity is created and changed by digital media and worldwide digital and technological developments. The exhibit titled “EGO UPDATE. The future of the digital identity” is the first by the museum’s new artistic head Alain Bieber and runs from September 19, 2015 – January 17, 2016. EGO UPDATE showcases pieces around self-image and the future of digital identity by 23 international artists, including: Kim Asendorf, LaTurbo Avedon, Evan Baden, Arvida Byström, Kurt Caviezel, Robbie Cooper, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, MC Fitti, Alison Jackson, Erik Kessels, Florian Kuhlmann, Dafna Maimon, Netro, Onformative, Ontheroofs, Martin Parr, Evan Roth, Andreas Schmidt, Guido Segni, Oliver Sieber, David Slater, Amalia Ulman and Jonas Unger.\nHighlights include:\nMartin Parr, the British Magnum photographer, visits local photo studios around the world to take self-portraits, and his series “Autoportrait” launched in 1991 and reflects global sociology of photographic taste.\nA Magnum Photobooth will be set up during the exhibit for visitors to have their picture taken in the style of world-leading Magnum photographers.\nBefore selfies emerged as a mass phenomenon, Jonas Unger handed Quicksnap cameras to celebrities to take pictures of themselves. Some of the self-portraits will be shown at EGO UPDATE.\nInspired by celebrity selfies that Taylor Swift, Margot Robbie and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley took of themselves doing ballet, Dafna Maimon will do the same at her ballet performance on December 12.\nDutch artist Erik Kessels is known for creating amusing illustrated stories from unknown photos and found footage. A new piece is planned for EGO UPDATE.\nSwiss artist Kurt Caviezel uses photos from publicly accessible online webcams for his explorations on exhibitionism and surveillance. In his piece “The Users” the viewer becomes a voyeur of the everyday.\nRomance and sex-related selfies are the object of Evan Baden’s work. His photo series “Technically Intimate” shows that privacy is merely an illusion on the world wide web.\nSelfies taken by Swedish artist Arvida Byström in subversive moments using glitter and pink are studies of femininity, sex, gender roles and search for identity.\nItalian artist Guido Segni’s series “The Middle Finger Response” shows self-portraits of poorly paid crowd workers – dubbed the “digital proletariat” – holding up the middle finger.\nVitaliy Raskalov and Vadim Makhorov take selfies after climbing the tallest buildings in USA, China and the United Arab Emirates and involve observers in their experience with these point-of-view shots.\nMany of the works are shown in digital form, as streams and other online displays and online performances. Moreover, the show includes an accompanying program, including the world’s first cyborg fair, from November 6-9, displaying the fusion of humans and technology. Other program points include a partner project, a special “Identity Convention” titled “Streaming Egos: Digital Identities in Europe.” Like the art exhibit, the project explores the question of human identity, but on a level of society, nations, and in Europe.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.nrw-forum.de .\nDüsseldorf’s tourism office is offering hotel and city specials for stays in 2015.
