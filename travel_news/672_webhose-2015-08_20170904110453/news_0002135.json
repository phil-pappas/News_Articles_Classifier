Cigar Advisor is an online cigar magazine that brings a fresh, irreverent, and down-to-earth perspective on all things cigars to thousands of smokers. In addition to educational cigar content and behind-the-scenes cigar industry articles from some of the business's top names, Cigar Advisor delivers an array of content about a variety of topics of interest to people who enjoy the cigar lifestyle. \nThe Dram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #1 is the first in a line of four cigars that have been blended to pair with the top whiskeys and bourbons in the industry. Each Dram Cask #1 is rolled using an undisclosed combination of binder and filler tobaccos in order for smokers to analyze the smoke on its own without preconceived notions of a tobaccos country of origin being a deciding factor on taste. This secret blend is then wrapped inside of a Connecticut Shade Grown wrapper to complete the overall marriage of flavors within the cigar. This particular video pairs the Cask #1 with Balvenie Doublewood 12 Year. \n\"Right off the bat, I taste the wood upfront. It's got almost a cedar sawdust in the air. Smells great, it tastes woody and almost peety which should go well with the scotch,\" said Evan Kechley, Executive Chef of Leaf Cigar Bar & Restaurant and guest cigar reviewer of the Dram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #1. Cigar Advisor Copywriter Jonathan Detore adds after the review, \"Blending cigars for whiskey is a brilliant idea. Cigars and whiskey is quite possibly the best pairing you can have, so to be able to do not only a cigar review, but one where you can taste first-hand the whiskeys meant for these particular cigars is a real treat. It brings the understanding of blending and pairing to a whole new level.\" \nDram Cigars for Whiskey Cask #1 cigars are available at Famous Smoke Shop, and is packaged in boxes of 20 cigars a piece. Each Cask #1 comes in a 6 x 54 Toro vitola with an individual retail price of $10 per cigar.
