Flight attendant Sarah Steegar. says some passengers are very memorable. Source: Twitter \nYES, there will always be the drunk and the obnoxious. But there are also passengers who stick in flight attendants’ memories — for all the right reasons. Sarah Steegar, a flight attendant with a major US carrier for the past 15 years, reveals her most memorable moments in the skies. \nTHE LUNCH KID \nIn my first year of flying (this was pre-9/11) I had a family who had ordered a kids meal for their four-year-old son. I don’t remember exactly what the complaint was, I think the boy just didn’t like it, but in some stroke of “new hire” oversweet exuberance I offered to share my own lunch. That I had made at home. \nThe parents readily accepted my offer and took everything I had without looking back, not even to say “thank you”. The cold lack of appreciation — or even acknowledgment that I had gone well above and beyond for them — left me stunned and kind of bummed out. \nIt’s OK, I reassured myself, They’re just distracted. I’m sure I’ll get a good letter. \nThat letter never came. \nSome element of that innocent, wide-eye newbie spirit died that day, but that’s okay — it needed to. This isn’t a story about them being terrible, it’s about how I learned an important lesson about boundaries on the job. I’m still a nice girl, but that girl would’ve been eaten alive before long. \nTHE BROKEN HEART \nWe were on our way to Paris on a Boeing 777 in June, packed to the gills. We had one cute university couple squished in the centre of economy class, but they were happy as they could be because they were gong to Europe for the first time. Together. In love! \nBirds were chirping over their heads. They were adorable. \nApproximately halfway through the flight, I entered the back galley to find the woman huddled in a corner, face buried in the crevice between two jumpseats. Within moments she was sobbing into my neck. \nSeveral of us flight attendants spent the next couple of hours with her in our arms as she hyperventilated her story. \nThey were to spend the first month on the farm of a French exchange-student friend. But the boyfriend had chosen this moment to tell her that he’d been cheating on her with the French woman they were going to stay with. \nHe hadn’t told her before because he didn’t want her to miss out on Europe, and she should still stay on the farm with them because, according to him, “It would all be cool”. \nShe wanted to turn around and go straight home upon landing. We told her not to, to instead demand the bulk of the travel money they’d saved up together so she could afford to continue her planned travel solo and not be trapped at the farm with them. \nWe understood she was both devastated and nervous about travelling alone, but she should absolutely not let his jerk move ruin this opportunity for her. It was one she might never get again. We spent the rest of the flight advising on alternative European travel plans and giving the jerk side-eye. \nI still wonder what she decided to do, and hope that she took the money and had a surprisingly amazing holiday. Sarah has seen it all. Source: Supplied \nTHE REFUGEES \nHands down, my favourite group of passengers to have is the refugees. Always. \nWe go through spurts where we’ll have them often, maybe 10-20 a week on certain routes, headed to the US for resettlement. It’s been a long while for me, but I hope I have them again. \nI’m not a person to take what I have for granted, so the effect of these passengers cannot be summed up in a platitude about being blessed. But if you ever get (or have had) the opportunity to speak with people who have been living in a refugee camp for years, it’s so moving. \nThey are usually both thrilled and terrified to be headed towards a new life in the exotic city. They might be a 30-year-old who had to leave everyone else behind, or a 12-year-old steeped in anxiety because he feels it’s now his responsibility to take care of his mother and siblings in this strange new country, who is too nervous and unsure of whether our food might make him ill to eat or drink anything but water. \nThere’s so much at stake for these passengers, and you so deeply wish you could do something more than smile and be kind and hope that they find a good new life overseas. \nNormally, the fact that passengers are in and out of our day and rarely seen again is a good thing in our job. It’s refreshingly uncomplicated. \nHowever, there are some days when we meet passengers we’ll truly never forget. Encountering such passengers might not always be fun, but they leave an important impression. Sometimes, they even leave us feeling lucky we got to meet them at all. \nSarah Steegar writes a regular column, Crewed Talk, on Flytertalk.com .
