Amity Beach with water slides and paddling pool, is a good option for young children. • The 10 best family days out from London Thumbs down Queues can be exceptionally long; unless you want to spend most of your day in one, budget for a Fastrack – (£8 for four water rides; £11 for Colossus, Nemesis Inferno, X and either Tidal Wave or Logger’s Leap), though even then you’ll have significant waits. While there are plenty of food outlets, quality is poor – expect burgers and undercooked French fries. • 50 great days out in the UK Top tips Head to the most popular rides first to beat the midday madness.
