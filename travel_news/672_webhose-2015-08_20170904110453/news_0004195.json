But it is really important to ensure that you carve out some proper time for you and your family that has absolutely nothing to do with work, because otherwise both you and the business – and your family – will ultimately suffer. So first, set some boundaries. Arrive and leave work at a sensible hour and make it clear to employees and customers that there will be certain set times when you will be uncontactable and unavailable – and stick to them. And manage expectations - don’t constantly answer emails and phone calls as soon as you get them, because then people will always expect you to respond that quickly. Remember that technology is there to serve you, not the other way round. Don’t try to be a perfectionist, either. In most cases \"good enough\" will do just fine. Be realistic too about what you can actually achieve in a given time period. There is nothing wrong with establishing a clear line between home and work Next, hand over some tasks and responsibilities to other people in your business. Just because you are in charge doesn’t mean you have do everything, so start sharing the workload more evenly. If you don’t think your present team are up to the task, hire better people. And take proper holidays, even if only for a few days. You can still check your emails, but twice a day rather than every couple of minutes. Finally, don’t apologise. There is nothing wrong with establishing a clear line between home and work. Never say, \"Sorry, I have to leave early\" or \"Sorry, I can’t do breakfast meetings\". Instead, take the lead and whenever possible schedule appointments at sensible times that work for you. Remember, it is not about quantity, it is about quality. Tara Burns, senior account director at Man Bites Dog, a marketing consultancy, says: “In today’s hyper-connected world, we experience personal and professional blurring more than ever. \"Rather than harking back to a bygone era of a 9-5 working day, though, SME owners should strive for an approach that is flexible and adapts to suit the needs of the business and those it employs. The always-on culture that has sprung from our devices should be embraced, rather than stressed about by SME leaders. “Everyone should have the freedom and technology to choose how and when they work, and every employee should feel comfortable asking for this. For instance, those who need to travel can utilise time that previously would have been wasted, and those with children can balance their tasks around childcare by working at alternative times that work for them. “There are huge business benefits to employees being given the freedom to work to their own schedule. Feeling valued and instilled with a sense of responsibility and trust provides employees with the welcome motivation to work hard, achieve results and give back with loyalty. \"Millennials in particular are drawn to workplaces that prioritise work life balance, so SME leaders should think about how they demonstrate this in their recruitment strategies. ‘’As a generation that is set to work for longer, it is important that we have the freedom to enjoy some downtime along the way. Business leaders that embrace this new era of flexibility will ensure work and life is balanced successfully for both employees, and themselves.’’ • One way to support your business and your staff is with the right company car, financed the best way for your business.
