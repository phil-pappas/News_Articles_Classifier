In doing so, I have delved into history, mythology and science,\" says Deepta. \nThe author who is a corporate lawyer by profession investigates the presence of the supernatural in the world we inhabit and writes about paranormal encounters she has had ranging from Bhangarh Fort on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, in the Lodhi gardens, the Konark Temple in Orissa, and the mental asylum of Bedlam in London. \nSo Deepta, her mother and their team of researchers are given a peek at Sooraj Bai, a dancer in the court of Akbar, who is still trapped in the ruins of the old fort in Bhangarh, built by Raja Bhagwan Das of Amber, in the latter half of the 16th century and was later the capital of his son, Madhi Singh. \nIn Night marchers of Puri, Deepta writes about her encounter of the spirit of Shyama Pallavi whose grief holds her down in this realm. \nThe Shore Temple in Mahabalipuram is talked about in the chapter God of the Elements and in The Healing Code of Konark, the author finds herself reliving her encounter with the spirit of the Iranian priestess of the Konark Sun Temple. \nDeepta explores the energies of the Safdurjung Road house of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who was assassinated and the psychic investigator writes about her experience. \nAlso in Delhi at the Lodhi Gardens, Deepta says she sees a young Persian scholar who fell victim to court intrigue, still continues her academic learnings. \nShe recalls a chilling encounter in the chapter Who Walks on Marine Drive? related to a peanut seller on Mumbai's Marine Drive who has a horde of people, including a father-daughter pair flocking to him. The people, says the author are those who died suddenly in the 2011 terrorist attacks and are hovering between the worlds of the living and dead. \nDeepta recounts her near death encounter in Bell Yard in London when she was sought out by a ghost in the chapter The Night of the Soul Bell. \nIn an introduction to the book Deepta's mother Ipsita writes about how she had had documented esoteric experiences in her autobiography Beloved Witch in the year 2000. Ipsita says she had faced an immediate backlash. \n\"Spirits have stories to tell. One must know how to listen,\" says Ipsita. \nThe wiccan refers to the ancient Egyptians who 'believed in the survival of the spirit after physical death'. \nIpsita writes about the 1960s researcher Hans Holzer who said, \"A Ghost is a split-off personality that remains behind in the environment of the person's previous existence, whether a home or a place of worship but closely tied to a spot where the person actually died...\" \n\"... We must remember that Abraham Lincoln, Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt all believed in the existence of spirits. Thomas Edison in fact was working on a machine to communicate with those in the other dimension,\" says Ipsita. \nSince the National Crime Records Bureau started compiling records in 1999, more than 2,300 people, mostly women, have been killed or murdered for being a 'dayan' or witch. \nToday in the states of Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra a legislation prohibits witch-hunts. \nAccording to Deepta, there are healing powers hidden within nature and Wiccan practices attempt to bring those powers through their rituals and it has nothing to do with black magic. \nShe says that wiccan, as a religion or practice, was perhaps the first feminist movement in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:31:53.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
