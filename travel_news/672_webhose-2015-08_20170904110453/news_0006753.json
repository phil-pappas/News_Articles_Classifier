Picture: REUTERS/CATHAL MCNAUGHTON Related articles Myanmar president poised for second term after rival ousted Suu Kyi party to decide ‘soon’ on contesting Myanmar polls Suu Kyi accelerates political battle as she turns 70 NAYPYITAW — Myanmar’s Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi said on Tuesday her opposition would ally with powerful ousted ruling party leader Shwe Mann, as the country’s political forces realign in the biggest shake-up since the end of military rule.\nPresident Thein Sein purged rival Mr Mann and his allies from the Ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) in dramatic fashion last week, just months before a landmark election.\n\"It is now clear who is the enemy and who is the ally,\" Ms Suu Kyi told reporters at the country’s parliament, when asked if Mr Mann’s sacking had cost her an ally.\n\"The National League for Democracy will work with the ally.\"\nShe did not detail how they would work together. As chairman of the USDP, Mr Mann sought to build ties with Ms Suu Kyi, which sparked suspicion among some members of the ruling party and contributed to his sacking. The USDP is made up of many former military officers.\nMr Mann had antagonised the military by backing Ms Suu Kyi’s campaign to reform the constitution to limit the sway of the generals over Myanmar’s politics.\nShe is banned from the presidency under a constitution drafted by the military before it handed over power in 2011. The armed forces hold a veto over any charter changes.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Mann denied he had divided the country in a speech to the joint chambers of parliament.\n\"I am not destroying party unity and stability,\" he said.\nSecurity forces surrounded the USDP compound late on Wednesday, locking down the building while the president’s allies met party leaders to remove Mr Mann’s faction from the leadership committee.\n\"As for the happenings of the middle of the night, this is not what you expect from a working democracy,\" Ms Suu Kyi said.\nIn response, Information Minister Ye Htut told reporters at a news conference that police had a duty to respond to a request for protection made during the evening by the USDP.\nMs Suu Kyi’s opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) would likely garner more votes in the November election due to the changes in the USDP, she said.\nHer party was already expected to win the most seats in the November election, seen as a crucial test of the country’s democratic reforms.\nConcerns over the durability of those reforms were heightened last week by a media crackdown in the wake of Mr Mann’s sacking.\nMr Htut said on Tuesday that a radio station, Cherry FM, with links to Mr Mann had been taken off the air until after the election due to concerns about bias.\nSpeaker of the house\nMr Mann still holds the position of speaker of the house and opened parliament for the last session before the vote on Tuesday.\nHe is under pressure to table a bill that establishes the rules for constituents to recall members of parliament and could lead to his own impeachment. He faces a petition from his own constituents.\nMs Suu Kyi said the bill was \"ridiculous\", as MPs could be recalled by just 1% of constituents.\nMr Mann on Tuesday also denied that he had misused party funds, which he said he was accused of in a letter last week. He did not give further details.\nMr Mann’s allies vowed to defend him in parliament.\n\"Most of the USDP lawmakers in the lower house are going to support Shwe Mann,\" said Aung Lynn Hlaing, a USDP member, as he entered parliament.\n\"Shwe Mann always represents us when we are ignored by the president. I think it’s not right the way they did what they did in our party.\"\nTension between the rival camps rose after the USDP last week omitted from its list the majority of a group of about 150 officers who retired from military service to run as USDP candidates.\nThe USDP also sidelined two of the president’s closest allies by leaving them off the candidate list.\nThey were Soe Thein, a powerful minister of the president’s office, and Aung Min, who was picked by Thein Sein to lead the government’s efforts to forge a peace agreement with the country’s armed ethnic groups.\nMr Mann’s fall from grace bears echoes of the political purges under the junta, leading some to doubt he has a future in public life.\n\"We can be sure they will uproot him by hook or by crook,\" said Thein Nyunt, a member of the parliament from the New National Democracy Party.\n\"So my best advice for him is ‘resign from the speaker’s position if you want to prevent further perils for you and your family’\".\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:43:46.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
