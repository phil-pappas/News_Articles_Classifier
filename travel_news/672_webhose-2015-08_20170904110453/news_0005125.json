SHARE offers an exclusive specialty dining experience for guests with a menu of signature dishes imagined for sharing, in an environment designed for conversing and creating memories. SHARE is scheduled to debut aboard Ruby Princess and Emerald Princess this December.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7578851-princess-cruises-curtis-stone/\nPreviously announced, this exclusive partnership with Chef Stone adds to the line's \" come back new \" brand promise, designed to elevate the onboard guest experience by introducing new culinary offerings dedicated to fresh, flavorful cuisine aboard all ships. As part of the partnership, \"Crafted by Curtis\" menu items offered in the main dining rooms will debut aboard Golden Princess in the fall and roll out fleet-wide through the end of 2015. Curtis Stone's Chef's Table experience will debut in early 2016.\nThe SHARE dining experience encourages connecting with family, friends and other cruisers by offering intriguing dishes served family style. Designed by Chef Stone, the menu features dishes such as a Charcuterie starter course; Butter Roasted Lobster with Caramelized Endive and Endive Foam; Twice Cooked Duck Leg with Fennel, Bacon jus and Parmesan Crumb; Tagliatelle with Roasted Alaskan Crab, Chili and Parsley; and Dark Chocolate Cremeux with Toasted Hazelnut Feuilletine and Burnt Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.\nWorking closely with Chef Stone and Princess Cruises, world-renowned hospitality designer Jeffrey Beers International has developed a dining ambiance that is a reflection of Chef Stone's creative vision and stems from his own childhood mealtime experiences, which were as much about family, community and connection as they were about the food itself. By creating a restaurant with a comfortable, homey atmosphere, the design allows for the important things in life to take center stage – people, and the activity of creating shared moments with one another over a delicious meal.\nA signature feature of SHARE is a communal table designed to encourage the sharing of a freshly prepared meal in the company of friends and family. Hand blown glass pendants etched with some of Chef Stone's favorite recipes cast an intimate glow and create a warm and celebratory experience. Elements not often seen in cruise ship restaurant interiors add to the friendly atmosphere – low-backed banquettes, beautifully upholstered in luxe Chesterfield tufted leather and decorative curios from Chef Stone's own collection including photographs and travel souvenirs make guests feel even more at home.\n\"We're honored that Princess Cruises is the home of Curtis Stone's first restaurant at sea,\" said Jan Swartz , Princess Cruises President. \"We know our guests will enjoy the menu Chef Stone has created for SHARE and we're sure they will also feel right at home dining in his new restaurant, just like we hope they always feel on a Princess cruise vacation. SHARE is an exciting new enhancement adding to our guest experience intended to fulfill our 'come back new' brand promise.\"\n\"It's only natural that my first restaurant at sea is named SHARE, as sharing food family-style with family and good friends is the most enjoyable way to eat,\" said Chef Stone. \"I love the process of passing plates amongst each other and creating meaningful connections through the food and conversation. I've worked feverishly to create elegant, tasty dishes that I'm really proud to serve in a beautiful and relaxed environment, and I'm excited that SHARE is set to become a special part of people's holiday memories and experience at sea.\"\nFollowing the debut of SHARE aboard Ruby Princess sailing from Los Angeles on cruises to Hawaii and Mexico and Emerald Princess sailing from Ft. Lauderdale to the Caribbean this December, the rollout will continue aboard Coral Princess cruising the Panama Canal in January 2016 and then Sun Princess in April 2016 , which will bring Chef Stone's restaurant to his home country, Australia.\nFor more information about the partnership, visit www.princess.com/curtis-stone.\nAdditional information about Princess Cruises is available through a professional travel consultant, by calling 1-800-PRINCESS (1-800-774-6237), or by visiting the company's website at princess.com .\nAbout Princess Cruises:\nOne of the best-known names in cruising, Princess Cruises is a global cruise line and tour company operating a fleet of 18 modern cruise ships renowned for their innovative design and wide array of choices in dining, entertainment and amenities, all provided in an environment of exceptional customer service.
