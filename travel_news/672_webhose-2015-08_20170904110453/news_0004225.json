It's on your dime now Aug 11, 2015, 7:25am MDT Industries & Tags Ed Sealover | Denver Business Journal The new look for Frontier airlines planes. If you want to call Frontier Airlines now, it's no longer a toll-free call. Frontier dropped its toll-free 800 number and now customers must call a Salt Lake City number. The Denver Post reported Frontier will save about $160,000 annually by the move, which was made at the end of June. In the latest U.S. Department of Transportation \" Air Travel Consumer Report ,\" Denver-based Frontier ranked second to last out of 13 major U.S. airlines in consumer complaints in May, the latest month available. Frontier had 8.2 consumer complaints per 100,000 passengers, well above the average airline complaint rate of 1.68 but better than Spirit Airlines' worst complaint rate of 12.73 complaints per 100,000 passengers. Last month, Frontier's complaint rate was detailed by the Denver Business Journal.
