Travel Updates Australian tourists evacuated from Vanuatu resort arson attack by: Paradise lost ... Aussie tourists have been caught up in a terrifying arson attack at a Vanuatu resort. Source: Supplied \nAUSTRALIAN tourists have been evacuated from a resort in Vanauatu after a terrifying arson attack. \nThe 21 holiday-makers were forced to flee their accommodation on the island of Tanna after petrol bombs were hurled and vehicles set alight. \nOne Australian woman — who local media said was in Vanuautu to help with the Cyclone Pam recovery effort — reportedly suffered facial injuries after she was hit with rocks and stones. \nThe owner of the resort told Radio New Zealand a group of youths had been harassing him for months and had caused over US$2 million worth of damage is a series of arson attacks. Horrific ... the resort owner said the attack could have resulted in deaths. Source: Supplied Hugh Lowe said the trouble started after the gang demanded money from him when he refused, they vandalised trucks belonging to a Chinese construction firm and set five bungalows on fire.\nThe group returned this week to “finish the job”, forcing him to evacuate the Aussie tourists to the safety of the capital Port Vila. \n“This was out of the blue and at night and could easily have resulted in serious deaths. Our resort again was full. I wasn’t evacuated out, I chose actually to leave, because there was no point in trying to protect property when I am quite certain that lives are at stake,” Mr Lowe said. Vanuatu’s Deputy Prime Minister Moana Carcasses said police were investigating the attacks. \nHe said Australia was Vanuatu’s biggest tourist market and the Government wouldn’t stand by while Australian tourists were harassed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T12:45:08.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
