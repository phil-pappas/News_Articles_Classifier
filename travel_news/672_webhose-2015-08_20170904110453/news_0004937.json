When the journey really IS the best part: The scenic roads... 27 shares Someone else booked the tickets for him, and he said it was ‘farcical’ because the outbound journey had one seat in the aisle and the other at the window, with a passenger seated between them.\nOn the return journey ‘one was in row 17 on the left and the other was in row 19 on the right’, he said.\nMr Price has never been weighed before a flight, and said the requirement to pay for a second seat is more for the comfort of the person seated next to him than his own.\nThe widower said: ‘The seat is only a certain size. It doesn’t matter whether I pay for two seats or not, I’ve still got to fit in that seat.\nLes Price forced to pay for two seats on a plane Mr Price was speaking about his experiences on This Morning with travel expert Simon Calder (left)\n‘If I’m paying for a seat I want to be comfortable, whether it means somebody else can’t sit next to me, but give that little bit of extra room.’\n‘It put me off last time I flew, so it’s been a few years now since I flew and my health has got a bit worse.’\nMr Price gradually gained weight as he got older, but fell into a depression and turned to comfort eating following the death of his wife, Zeruiah, in 2009.\nUzbekistan Airways, the Central Asian country’s national carrier, has set off a firestorm of controversy over its decision to weigh passengers before allowing them to board.\nIt said all passengers will have to stand on scales with their personal luggage after they have checked in and that the decision is based on flight safety.\nIt will mean some overweight travellers could be excluded from busy flights on smaller planes if limits are exceeded.\nTravel expert Simon Calder, who joined Mr Price on This Morning, said European airlines force passengers to pay for an adjacent seat if they do not fit.\nHe said the policies vary from airline to airline and need to be standardised.\nOutspoken TV personality Katie Hopkins has called on airlines to charge a ‘fat tax’ for overweight plane passengers.\nShe recently told MailOnline: ‘I've thought this for a long time. It seems crazy that I'm charged to check in a bag whereas some 20-stone idiot next to me with hand luggage isn't charged anything even though they're carrying as much extra weight. I think that's very fair.'\nIn 2013, Samoan Air became the world's first airline to charge passengers according to their weight. This helped manage its on-board weight effectively and enabled costing plans to be more streamlined.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1WpoOyB"], "published": "2015-08-15T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T15:03:59.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
