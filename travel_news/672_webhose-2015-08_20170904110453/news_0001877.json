I feel like a kid on the first day of school, about to step on stage and introduce myself.\nIn fact, I’m in the audience, watching the premiere of Machine de Cirque in Montréal, a troupe of five young circus performers fresh out of school. They’re trying to top each of their own tricks with bigger, riskier spectacles. And it’s making me very nervous.\nMontréal Complètement Cirque, the city’s annual weeklong international circus festival, is the first of its kind in North America, and during my three-day visit, my emotions have run the gamut from awe and amusement to anxiety and hope. These fundamental human emotions form the heart of circus performances, says festival director Nadine Marchard.\nContemporary circus retains that core element of heart-pounding risk, but as it expands its repertoire to include music, theatre, dance and beyond, circus is becoming increasingly difficult to define.\n“I like that circus doesn’t fit into a neat box, it keeps the field exciting,” says Elodie Peltier, who travelled here from Paris, where she is international relations adviser for circus company 2r2c.\nThe traditional roots of circus can be traced back to London and Paris in the 18th century. But today, Montréal is considered the circus capital of the world, thanks in no small part to the veritable empire of Cirque du Soleil, and the now well-established National Circus School that welcomes students from all over the globe. Together with la TOHU, an international performance venue and community outreach space, these three pillars form “circus city” in Montréal.\nOnce a barren patch of earth sandwiched between a highway and a garbage dump, circus city has filled a much-needed space in the poor community of Saint-Miche. Circus city is an unusual crossroads of culture, environment and community. “Circus helps us preserve our culture while also cultivating open-mindedness in the next generation,” says Stéphane Lavoie, programming director for la TOHU.\nLa TOHU is housed in what was the first LEED-gold certified building in Québec, complete with community agricultural plots and bee hives. It offers free performances to locals, and community programming to at-risk youth.\nA positive socio-cultural dimension to circus had never occurred to me. But as I wander up and down Rue Saint Denis, where performers have gathered, I notice that the circus’ diversity, energy and creativity reflects the city’s the best qualities.\nStreet circus brings an immersive human-to-human contact we miss out on in a digitally mediated environment, says Anthony Venisse, director of street performances Les Minutes and DUELS.\nIn a final outdoor performance in Place Emilie-Gamelin, a wordless moving narrative of a circus performer in a wheelchair nearly brings me to tears. It’s a message of beauty and hope, and I come away with a more profound understanding of the psychological power of circus.\nPerformer Antoine Lépine from Cirque Alfonse sums it up perfectly: “It’s like seeing the world through the eyes of a child.”\nCircus Performer Profiles\nName: Yohann Trépanier\nRole: Juggler, Bicycle Acrobat\nFrom: St-Simon-Les-Mines, Québec\nTroupe: Machine de Cirque\nPerforming for: 13 years\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider? Circus lies in between sport and art. You can take an idea and explore it in so many ways. It’s all about mixing elements of life. Circus is a very old and well-established discipline but every circus art is different; no two artists have the same profile.\nHow did you choose this career? It’s a long story. Circus changed my life. I wasn’t interested in anything at school, and I wasn’t on a great path. One night, I was drinking in a park when I met a juggler who taught me how to juggle. I started doing it all the time; I was so happy to have found something I enjoyed. My parents found a circus school in Québec and began to drive me from our small town to my classes. They were just happy that I had finally found my thing.\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montréal? There’s always something to do in Montréal. There are so many small shows. I also do some photography so I love photographing old buildings and graffiti.\nName: Raphaël Dubé\nRole: Juggler, Acrobat\nFrom: Quebec City\nTroupe: Machine de Cirque\nPerforming for: 14 years\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider?: It’s all about one thing: enjeux, or the stakes of a performance. Circus is about the risks you take, which can be both physical and mental. It comes down to the drive to push yourself as far as you can.\nHow did you choose this career?: My older brothers were in circus so that’s why I started so young. It’s a pleasure for me to be on stage. I’m more comfortable on stage than off, because on stage you have no limits.\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montreal?: The number of shows, festivals and events that are going on all at once in the summer.\nName: Geneviève Morin\nRole: Circus Artist\nFrom: Laurentides, Québec\nTroupe: Cirque Alfonse\nPerforming for: 7 years\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider?: It’s a blend of many arts, (dance, theatre, music, etc.) but you add acrobatics to make it more exciting.\nHow did you choose this career?: I did gymnastics and dance as a child so it was kind of natural. I had a friend in high school who was fond of circus but too scared to audition at the National Circus School here in Montréal alone, so she asked me to go with her. I did, and now here I am!\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montreal?: It’s really nice to have four different seasons; it affects your mood and adds variety to the type of activities you can do. Also, the people are really sociable.\nName: Antoine Carabinier Lépine\nRole: Co-founder, co-artistic director and circus artist for Cirque Alfonse\nFrom: St-Alphonse-Rodriguez, Québec\nTroupe: Cirque Alfonse\nPerforming for: 15 years\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider? It’s trying to do movements and acrobatics that most people think are impossible, blended with arts like dance, music, theatre, film, etc. It’s the best job ever!\nHow did you choose this career?: My parents brought me to see a year-end show by the National Circus School of Montréal and that’s when I fell in love with circus.\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montreal?: The people and the multiculturalism that make Montréal so full of life!\nName: Élise Bergeron\nRole: Dancer\nFrom: Val d’Or, Québec\nTroupe: Freelance dancer, co-choreographer of Strictement {a}statique\nPerforming for: 5 years professionally, 26 years in total!\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider? Circus is crazy; performers attempt the craziest things that they can do. They’re always playing on the edge of danger and control. Circus is adrenalin in a pure state!\nHow did you choose this career? I didn’t choose to dance, I just followed my gut.\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montreal?: Independent art overruns the city; it’s everywhere. Every day, you can choose to go listen to a music show at Quai des Brumes on the Plateau, or stop in an art gallery in Villeray or go see a theatre or dance show in Zone Homa in Hochelaga. Independent art is really active.\nName: Vlad Lissouba\nRole: Hand-to-hand performer\nFrom: My father is Russian and my mother is French-Congolese. I was born in France and lived in Congo until we moved to Montréal when I was seven.\nTroupe: Performer for Les Minutes Complètement Cirque, and student at the National School of Circus in Montréal\nPerforming for: 5 years\nHow would you describe circus to an outsider? Circus is a performance art that can be divided into categories such as aerial (e.g. trapeze, silks), acrobatics (e.g. Chinese hoops, Chinese pole), balancing (e.g. handstands, tightrope), manipulation (e.g. juggling), and of course clowning.\nHow did you choose this career?: I used to study software engineering and I practiced some acrobatics and parkour on the side. After performing in a dance festival. I was encouraged to audition for a circus show. There I met students of the National Circus School and was amazed at all the things they could do and how well they could move. It seemed surreal to me, and I wanted to be like them. So I hired a private coach to prepare for the school auditions and got in. Three years later, I have never been happier.\nWhat’s your favourite thing about Montréal?: The city really comes alive in the summer. There’s always a festival somewhere. The streets are closed and all the shops open up beautiful terraces on the sidewalk. There is art everywhere, painted on the buildings and projected on monuments. The food is delicious and the parks are beautiful, too!\nPhoto on file: “Circus Feature Intro — MCC_Duels 2_crédit Rénald Laurin”\nUpcoming Circus Shows\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Le Monde Est Fou”\nWhere: Trois-Rivières, QC\nWhen: On now through August 15, 2015\nWhat: Machine de Cirque\nWhere: Rimouski, QC\nWhen: August 22, 2015\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Varekai”\nWhere: Toronto, ON\nWhen: September 2—6, 2015\nWhat: Les 7 Doigts De La Main’s “Moby Dick”\nWhere: Montréal, QC\nWhen: September 22 — October 17, 2015\nWhat: Cirque Alfonse’s “Timber!”\nWhere: Burlington, ON\nWhen: October 29, 2015\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Kooza”\nWhere: Vancouver, BC\nWhen: October 29 — December 13, 2015\nWhat: Cirque Alfonse’s “Timber!”\nWhere: Markham, ON\nWhen: November 1, 2015\nWhat: Les 7 Doigts De La Main’s “Traces”\nWhere: Toronto, ON\nWhen: December 15—27, 2015\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Toruk”\nWhere: Montréal, QC\nWhen: December 21—30, 2015\nWhat: Cirque Eloise’s “Cirkopolis”\nWhere: Quebec City, QC\nWhen: March 2—5, 2016\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Toruk”\nWhere: Hamilton, ON\nWhen: May 20—22, 2016\nWhat: Cirque du Soleil’s “Toruk”\nWhere: London, ON\nWhen: May 27—29, 2016\nMore on thestar.com\nRestaurants Canada CEO ignored allegation of physical abuse, says former cook\nThe right wine glass is very important: Gord on Grapes", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T18:22:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
