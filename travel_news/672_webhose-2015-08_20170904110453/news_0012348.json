It is true that your favorite New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc or California Merlot will be a head-turning train wreck with Thai food, so you have to be a unconventional and venture into the realms of viniferous unfashionability – specifically wines that are a little off-dry, Riesling and Pinot Gris from Germany or Alsace are wines that will reward . The big advantage here is that, being out of vogue, they are ridiculous bargains. The quality return on the buck spent is terrific, and puts California Chardonnay to shame. Pinot Gris Classic, Huge l 2012 ($24)Alsace, France Medium dry, but the minerally, citrus bite on the finish results in a combination that’s wonderful with Thai fish, pork and chicken. And it's the best label in the whole wine world. Domaine du Tariquet , Premières Grives 2013 $14Côtes de Gascogne, France100% Gros Manseng Dripping with honey and lemon, it will be great with all Thai food. Riesling, Domaines Schlumberger , Grand Cru Saering 2010 $28Alsace, France Just fabulous! A tad off dry, brimming with the flavors of ripe summer peaches, yellow cherries, a racy minerality balanced by delicate citrus finish. Yumm! Riesling Prinz von Hessen 2012 ($16)Rheingau, Germany Glorious! Delicate with the laser-like intensity one only finds in fine Riesling, and such a bargain too! Perfect for milder Thai curries. J Brut Rosé NV ($38)Napa, California An outlier here from one of California’s best producers of fizz. Despite being labeled “Brut” it is, in fact, a little off dry – a silent nod to the adage that Americans talk dry but drink sweet – but this makes it a Thai-friendly delight.", "external_links": ["http://www.tariquet.com/default_uk.asp", "http://www.hugel.com/", "http://www.jwine.com/", "http://www.domaines-schlumberger.com/", "http://www.prinz-von-hessen.de/en/index.htm"], "published": "2015-08-25T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:10:33.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
