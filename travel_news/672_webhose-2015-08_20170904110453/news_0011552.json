A second video of the shooting, apparently recorded by the killer, was posted on social media even as police tried to locate the suspect.\nReporter Alison Parker was interviewing an economic development official about local tourism as eight shots rang out. She screamed, ran and could be heard saying \"Oh my God,\" as she too was shot. Adam Ward's camera captured a fleeting image, including the face, of a man holding a handgun.\nWDBJ quickly switched back to a shot of the anchor back at the station, her eyes large and jaw dropping as she said, \"OK, not sure what happened there. We will of course let you know as soon as we find out what those sounds were from.\"\nThe suspect is Vester Lee Flanagan II, 41, of Roanoke, said Becky Coyner with dispatch and records at the Augusta County Sheriff's Office.\nLaw enforcement personnel were in hot pursuit, with multiple vehicles following him closely down Interstate 64 at one point, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said.\n\"They're right behind him,\" he said during an appearance on WTOP-FM's \"Ask the Governor\" Wednesday morning.\nVideo of the shooting was later posted on the Twitter account and Facebook page of Bryce Williams, who was on the staff at WDBJ. It showed an outstretched arm holding the handgun and firing repeatedly at Parker as she tried to run away.\nABC News reported on its website that the network received a 23-page fax from someone claiming to be Williams. The network says the fax was turned over to authorities and did not elaborate on its contents.\nFederal law enforcement was assisting, and federal officials said there was no indication of a connection to terrorism.\nThe shooting happened around 6:45 a.m. at Bridgewater Plaza in Franklin County, as Parker interviewed Vicki Gardner about the upcoming 50th anniversary festivities for Smith Mountain Lake, a local tourism destination. Gardner also was wounded.\nBoth the victims were romantically involved with other employees at the station, according to Parker's boyfriend, WDBJ anchor Chris Hurst.\nParker had just turned 24. She had just completed a special report on child abuse for the station, where she had worked as an intern. She attended James Madison University, where she was the editor of the school's newspaper, The Breeze. According to her Facebook page, Parker spent most of her life outside Martinsville, Virginia. She was an avid kayaker and attended community theater events in her spare time.\nHurst said they hadn't shared their relationship publicly but \"were very much in love.\" He said they had just moved in together and wanted to get married. \"I am numb,\" he said.\nWard, 27, graduated from Virginia Tech University and was engaged to a producer at the station, Melissa Ott, said WDBJ spokesman Mike Morgan.\n\"Adam was our go-to guy. He pretty much was available to do anything that we asked,\" Morgan said. \"He did live shots during our morning show for several years.\"\nThe station is based in Roanoke, Virginia, and serves the southwest and central part of the state. The shopping mall where the incident happened is just off Smith Mountain Lake in Moneta, about 25 miles southeast of Roanoke.\nPolice have told employees of the station to stay inside the building as long as the suspect is on the loose. About 50 people work there, Marks said.\n\"We have police protection,\" Marks said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:05:00.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
