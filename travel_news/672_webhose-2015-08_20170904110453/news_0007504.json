Photo taken: July 27, in his backyard. Photographer’s description: “I heard the oddest noises coming from a tree. I thought the squirrel was severely injured. No, it was just curled up on a branch with its tail curled overhead. Then it started to stretch. And stretch. And then it stretched out its paw. It’s amazing how flexible they are! Taken with a Sony Alpha 77, Tamron lens at 280mm.” Katie’s critique: “A hilarious moment captured. Wow! Great job. I love how the big branches go through the frame and in turn frame the squirrel. I wish the brush and smaller twigs behind the squirrel were a little more blurred so as not to distract (this can be done by adjusting the aperture).” Photographer: Chris Picard, Seattle. Photo taken: July 27, Gas Works Park, Seattle. Photographer’s description: “A couple times a year I head down to Gas Works Park at night in an attempt to get this photo. It must be dead calm and there must be no boat traffic. I spent around a half-hour waiting for the conditions to become ideal and then took this image. There is one small boat on the left but it was moving so slowly it did not churn up the water. I used a Nikon D7100 on a tripod with an 18×140 MM lens at 8 sec., f/8, ISO 200.” Katie’s critique: “Kudos to the photographer for going back multiple times to perfect this photo; the clean reflection of colorful city light definitely makes it. The 8-second exposure creates a glow of the lights that I enjoy a lot. I also like the oblong crop with the horizon directly centered, which makes me think of a heart-monitor readout.” Photographer: Radka Chapin, Redmond. Photo taken: July 2, North Cascades National Park. Photographer’s description: “We were returning to camp after a long climb of a remote peak when we enjoyed a beautiful sunset over the mountains. This was day 6 of a nine-day mountaineering traverse in North Cascades National Park. Few places are as rugged, remote and wild as this. Nikon D600, lens Nikon 16-35 mm, F/4.” Katie’s critique: “The choice of the wide angle lens was a great decision. I love that the person is minuscule and able to breathe in the frame and we are able to experience the ruggedness of those mountains. The smooth colors give a calming effect to the image.” Photographer: Shun Takano, Renton. Photo taken: July 18, Renton Highlands. Photographer’s description: “My daughter brought my wife some sunflowers, so I decided to take some macro photos of them. Taken with a Sony A7M2 with Sony FE 90mm macro lens.” Katie’s critique: “I love the use of the macro lens to create an abstract photograph. Being able to see the detail of the fuzzies on the green petals (which I learned are called phyllaries) is great, and that shallow depth of field where we are still able to make out the sunflower petals is wonderful. Beautiful photo.” Photographer: Howard Ehmer, Kirkland. Photo taken: June 28, Tipsoo Lake, Mount Rainier National Park. Photographer’s description: “The first bit of Sunday morning sunlight hits Mount Rainier. Tipsoo Lake sits in the foreground, with the summer wildflowers in full bloom. I had stayed up all night photographing this area under the stars, with a near-full moon lighting the landscape. The photo was taken with a Fuji X-T1 mirrorless camera.” Katie’s critique: “The colors in this photograph are gorgeous — great job by the photographer to get them to pop. I enjoy all the different lines that keep your eye wanting more. The contrast in the dark tree line and its reflection with the colorfulness of the rest of the frame also adds to this. Stunning photo.” Photographer: Jignasha Patel, Bellevue. Photo taken: July 4, Reflection Lakes, Mount Rainier National Park. Photographer’s description: “We went to visit Mount Rainier for the first time since I moved to Seattle. The photo was taken with a Nikon d3000 18-55mm lens. The excitement in our little party of four was tangible. I think this photo captures that pretty well.” Katie’s critique: “This photo says summer in the Pacific Northwest. It’s crisp. I love the pop of pink along the brim of her hat, which draws your eye in to the center of the image and then to the mountain. TIP: Crop up just until you can’t see the sign in order to clean up the frame.” Photographer: Rona Zevin, Seattle. Photo taken: June 15, Sequim. Photographer’s description: “The lavender in Sequim was early this year (enabling me to) photograph poppies with the lavender. I used a Canon 6D, 70-200mm lens at 144mm, f18 at 1/13 of a second. The slow shutter speed and slight camera movement gave it the impressionist look.” Katie’s critique: “This definitely doesn’t look like a photo at first glance, which makes it unique and absolutely lovely. The photographer’s creativity in using a slow shutter with slight camera movement to create this painting-like photograph is refreshing. The contrast of the red poppies against the lavender adds a needed layer and pop of color. Bravo!” Photographer: Lynn Colwell, Renton. Photo taken: June 10, Bellevue Botanical Garden. Photographer’s description: “Was out with a friend when we spied this orange dragonfly on an orange red-hot poker. I’d never seen an orange dragonfly before so this seemed strangely wonderful and a bit mysterious. Used my Leica, which has no macro setting, so stood way back and tried to steady my hands using the telephoto so the background would blur.” Katie’s critique: “Great shot! I love how close we are to see all the details of the flower and the dragonfly. Wow, they are intricate creatures! The contrast of all the orange with the clean green background is perfect. My only critique — and this is me digging because this frame is all-around great — is that it is a little backlit. A little reflector could help with that slight bit of shade.” Photographer: Karen Dohr, Seattle. Photo taken: May 31, Post Falls, Idaho. Photographer’s description: “This photo was taken at the Spokane Lantern Festival where thousands of people came to light lanterns and watch their golden light float away into the night sky. Don’t worry! Ninety percent of the lanterns are recovered after the event and they are 100-percent biodegradable. The photo was taken with a Canon 6D.” Katie’s critique: “I love the foreground where we’re able to see what the lantern looks like and where people are about to send theirs off, arms extended. And the small dots of lanterns in the sky are really cool, like a little galaxy of stars and planets. The contrast of blue and orange is great. I almost want the frame to be wider, but that might also clutter it. Beautiful job by the photographer.” Photographer: Robert Martin, Des Moines Photo taken: May 26, photographer’s backyard. Photographer’s description: “I noticed this American Robin taking a bath as I walked past the window. Just had to add to many photos of birds bathing or getting a drink in our copper bird bath. I liked this shot showing the robin throwing the water onto its back. Taken with a Nikon D7000, 80-400mm lens set at 310mm, f5.3, 1/400 second.” Katie’s critique: “This photo is probably in my top three bird photos of all time — it’s just so good! The motion blur is great along with the water coming off the beak and the splash in the bird bath. The moment clearly makes this frame a gem. Great job using a long lens to compress the background and blur it out so we can focus on the robin.” Photographer: Viet Lam, Seattle. Photo taken: June 1, Lake Union. Photographer’s description: “This was shot using a GoPro. My friends (Ravi Singh and Karen Dohr) decided to do a sunrise paddle to witness the birth of a new day from a different vantage point. This was taken at 5:30 a.m. The rest of the day was gray and rainy.” Katie’s critique: “This is a really cool capture. I like the bridge cutting through the photo and the kayak filling out the bottom of the frame, as well as the surprise of the paddleboarder near the sunrise. What makes this frame unique is that it was taken with a GoPro on a stick. I love that technologies are growing so we can take a little waterproof camera like this out in the middle of the lake and not have to worry about a bulky (and expensive) camera falling into the water. TIP: Try cropping out a little less than half the sky to elongate the frame and draw the eye in.” Photographer: Jessica E. LaVoie, Seattle. Photo taken: May 28, Trillium Lake, near Mount Hood, Ore. Photographer’s description: “One of my favorite spots in Oregon … I think the picture speaks for itself. I used my Nikon D5200, tripod and self-timer (I like to insert myself in my photos from time to time because it gives my pictures that something extra, makes them different, stand out). The conditions were ‘just right’ that day. Every time I stare at this picture it takes me back to that moment on the bridge; peace, stillness, and happiness filling my soul.” Katie’s critique: “I love that this is a self-portrait of sorts. The conditions were definitely perfect, with calm, glassy water reflecting the mountain, trees and clouds. The layers are great, adding depth; I especially like the bridge in the foreground. Beautiful capture.” Photographer: Martin Palmer, Mill Creek. Photo taken: May 16, Upper Elliot Trail, North Cascades. Photographer’s description: “I was on a hike to Goat Lake. I came upon a grove of deciduous trees flanking the trail. I used an 8mm fisheye lens on a Nikon D5100 camera to get the effect of the tree canopy converging.” Katie’s critique: “Great use of the fisheye lens, which can be tricky to use as images are easily distorted. All of the leading lines are fabulous, from the trail to all the tree trunks. The softness of all the high-up foliage is a nice balance with the thick brush weighing down the bottom of the frame. I love this photograph.” Photographer: Steven Bishofsky, Seattle. Photo taken: April 14, Ballard Locks. Photographer’s description: “I was looking down at this heron from the walkway at the Ballard Locks and beginning to think that I’d be late for work when the bird finally took flight. I used my Nikon D3100 set on f5 at 1/1000 second with a Tamron 600mm lens.” Katie’s critique: “The texture is great — from the ripples on the water to the detail in the feathers. Nice job waiting it out to get this photo. (I hope you weren’t late for work!) The bird pops against the water, a nice clean background. I almost wish the heron were in the lower third of the frame, with more water at the top left to give it some flying room. But, nonetheless, beautiful photo.” Photographer: Patrick Sloan, Renton. Photo taken: April 16, Wild Horse Monument, Vantage, Grant County. Photographer’s description: “The Aurora index was marginal throughout the day, but I decided to give it a shot and drove out to the Wild Horse Monument to see if I could capture the Northern Lights. I was just about to give up when the color started to show. I was able to capture this image after hiking up to the monument in the dark. I used a Sony RX100M3 with a 25-second exposure at F1.8, ISO 1000.” Katie’s critique: “Gorgeous colors! I love how they fade across the sky and the frame. Awesome choice of foreground. What stands out to me is that the photographer planned. Yes, the Photo Gods shine down on us once in a while, but most of the time a lot of planning goes into a frame. Kudos to Patrick Sloan for taking a chance, researching that the Northern Lights might appear, and getting out there to capture this beautiful photo.” Photographer: Gloria Z. Nagler, Lake Forest Park. Photo taken: Late April at Seattle’s Magnuson Park. Photographer’s description: “”Mallard yoga: At Magnuson Park wetlands … taken with my Canon 5D Mark III, 70-200m lens. “ Katie’s critique: “What a funny moment! I love that the duck is doing some yoga in the rain. Fabulous use of the rule-of-thirds, which also allows for a clean background. Getting to see the duck’s head and that pop of color is great. I might crop down from the top, where there is excess dead space. Great find.” Photographer: Kim Hart, Poulsbo. Photo taken: April 17, from Poulsbo home. Photographer’s description: “Taken as the sun slipped behind the Olympics and Mount Walker.” Camera data: Nikon D7100, 18-200mm lens (shot at 200 mm, f/5.6, 1/250 sec, ISO 320) Katie’s critique: “I have seen many gorgeous sunset shots coming out of the Pacific Northwest because of the smoke drifting here from Siberian wildfires. This is one of those great shots. The many layers in this photo are beautiful, adding depth to the frame. This was exposed well for shooting directly at the sun, although I’m sure the smoke and light cloud cover helped with this. The sun is positioned perfectly. Lovely photograph.” Photographer: Aaron Frank, from Roy, Pierce County. Photo taken: April 7, Ruby Beach, Olympic National Park. Photographer’s description: “On a trip back from Shi Shi Beach we decided to catch the sunset at Ruby Beach. This pure natural beauty was taken with my Nikon D5100, with 14mm ultrawide Rokinon lens.” Katie’s critique: “Great job framing the sun so it bursts through that archway. I love the added element of the person on top of the rock; this photo wouldn’t be as great without him or her. (I wish the focus was on the person — it’s a bit soft — instead of the driftwood in the center of the frame.) The reflection and symmetry are nice additions to the frame. Tip: Try cropping from the left of the frame to make it more vertical and position that burst onto the thirds.” Photographer: John Melicor, Bremerton. Photo taken: April 4, Skagit Valley. Photographer’s description: “Tulip fields near Mount Vernon, taken with a Canon T5i.” Katie’s critique: “The chunks of color really accentuate the leading lines in this photograph. I also enjoy how the photographer got down low and captured the light, which emphasizes the texture of the tulip leaves. The depth of field is great, producing nice layers. Beautiful photo all around.” Photographer: Yang Wang, Redmond. Photo taken: April 4, Seattle. Photographer’s description: “This is the ending stage of the moon eclipse with Space Needle as foreground. Photo was taken by Canon 7D Mark II with EF70-300mm L lens.” Katie’s critique: “This is a difficult photo to capture, especially when Seattle’s weather can ruin photo plans with a single rain cloud. The photographer did a good job of balancing the low light conditions but exposing the moon correctly and keeping the Space Needle fairly sharp. I love the dead space around the Needle, allowing it to breathe, and centering it in the frame, breaking the rule of thirds. It would also make a beautiful vertical photo.” Photographer: Craig Goodwin, Spokane. Photo taken: March 19, near Ritzville, Adams County. Photographer’s description: “It was cloudy and rainy during (a recent) epic geomagnetic storm, but I’ve learned that there is usually an echo for a couple days after a big showing of the Northern Lights, so I ventured out. I find that the key for these kinds of shots is to compose the night sky with an interesting foreground. This church had been on my radar. Taken with a 24mm Rokinon lens on a Nikon D600, ISO 4000, f2.5, 20-second exposure.” Katie’s critique: “Incredible photograph! Just … wow! The elongated crop accentuates the dramatic sky and positions the church on the thirds. Bringing up the highlights on the church makes it pop, just as much a focal point as the Aurora Borealis. The church adds interest as an extra layer. Beautiful job all around.” Photographer: Mark Wangerin, Seattle. Photo taken: March 11, near Lamoine, Douglas County. Photographer’s description: “Out for a day of birding east of the mountains, a 575-mile, 15-hour trip! The highlight … was the discovery of a pair of long-eared owls in a stand of pine. Taken with Nikon D7100 with Sigma 150-500 lens.” Katie’s critique: “This owl is so cute! (And that’s saying something coming from me, who isn’t a fan of birds.) Great framing of the face and those wide eyes by the tree branches. Also, great job getting in tight enough so we can see how the owl camouflages with the tree. I might crop in from the left and slightly off the top to clean it up just slightly. Beautiful capture of a beautiful bird.” Photographer: Quinn Richard Lynam, age 9, Kirkland. Photo taken: Point Defiance Zoo, Tacoma. Photographer’s description: “Going to the zoo is a favorite family outing. Capturing a cooperative Bengal tiger through the camera lens, and a beautiful sunshine day give light and life to the perfect picture.” — Submitted by Barbara Brown Lynam, Quinn’s grandmother. Camera: Canon EOS Rebel T3 with Tamron 18-270mm lens. Katie’s critique: “This is a great portrait of a beautiful animal. Awesome job getting in tight to create a connection between the viewer and tiger; I really like the elongated crop, which highlights the leading lines that make the eyes the focal point. Quinn: Keep chasing beautiful light and making beautiful photographs. Maybe in 15 years The Seattle Times will be fortunate enough to hire you.” Photographer: Andrew Kearns, Bothell. Photo taken: Feb. 17, Mount Pilchuck. Photographer’s description: “Some friends and I saw the weather would be great for the weekend, so we went up and stayed the night at the Mount Pilchuck fire lookout to catch the sunrise. It was tight. Canon 60D, ISO 100, f5.6, 1/100 second.” Katie’s critique: “An absolutely gorgeous shot. I love the softness the light produces on the angular peaks. Great job centering the person in the frame (nicely breaking the rule of thirds) and getting just enough sunrise to produce some soft color in the photo. I think a lot of people believe they have to point their lens directly at the sun during a sunrise or sunset, but by directing the camera so the sun is just at the corner of the frame it creates more depth and a more interesting photo.” Photographer: Jim Zaikoski, Vancouver, Wash. Photo taken: Feb. 21, Sauvie Island, Ore. Photographer’s description: “A large flock was on the ground a bit after sunrise and I took this photo when the flock all took off at once. Equipment: Nikon D810, Lens: 70-200 @ 92mm F8, 1/1000, 800 ISO.” Katie’s critique: “I love the ‘Where’s Waldo?’ feel of this photo, which immediately caught my eye. I want to get deeper into the photo and look at all those birds’ expressions (can birds have expressions?) and their feet and wings and see how they are all different. Great job getting in tight to eliminate any distracting surroundings. Tip: I might try going in a little tighter to get rid of the brush in the background on the bottom left corner, or moving lower to the ground to shoot higher so the sky is the background. All-around fantastic photo.” Photographer: Yoshiki Nakamura, Seattle. Photo taken: Feb. 14, Golden Gardens Beach Park, Seattle. Photographer’s description: “The woods in Golden Gardens Beach Park provides a wonderful photo opportunity, especially in winter when leaves are fallen and branches are in silhouette. The reflected sunlight added layers of various color and brightness to the scene. I love this place and setting for photography.” Expert says: “I’ve seen this shot in Golden Gardens a couple times and it’s always one of my favorites. I love the way the bare branches create silhouetted lines across a colorful sunset. The added bonus to this frame is the boat in the water, creating more layers and depth. I love the golden color that gives this location it’s name. Beautiful job.” -Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Laveda Loose, Juneau, Alaska. Photo taken: Jan. 4, outside Juneau. Photographer’s description: “Nikon D810 was used for this image of the northern lights over the twin peaks above Mendenhall Glacier, with Mendenhall River in the foreground.” Expert says: “The northern lights is one of those wonders that blows my mind and is definitely on my bucket list to photograph. In this frame, the photographer very nicely captures this wonder and the beauty of Alaska. The slow shutter (13 seconds) captures the movement within this photograph: from the slow river in the foreground to the glow of the dwelling nestled in the trees and then the snow blowing off the gorgeous peaks (and of course the northern lights). Lovely photo.” -Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Radka Chapin, Redmond. Photo taken: Jan. 31, Hidden Lake Peaks, North Cascades. Photographer’s description: “It’s been a low-snow year so we set out to search for skiable snow in the North Cascades. Even though the skiing was challenging, the views made up for it. We watched this onion-shaped cloud form above Mount Baker in the distance, as we skied down from Hidden Lake Peaks. Shot with a Nikon D600, 16-35 mm lens.” Expert says: “Kudos to the photographer for getting out there in the right place at the right time, which can sometimes make a great photo. The “onion-shaped cloud” with swirls pointing directly at Mount Baker, make this photo stand out. I love the choice of a wide-angle lens to get the surrounding peaks and the small skier in the frame.” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Stanton Prescott, Seattle. Photo taken: Jan. 7, Kerry Park, Seattle. Photographer’s description: “Sun breaking through the fog during sunrise. 1/4000 sec, f/4.5, ISO: 100.” Expert says: “Moody is the first word that comes to mind after glimpsing this photo. That moodiness created by the sun trying to get through the fog is golden. I love how the dark parts on the top and bottom of the frame are even, and how they are connected with the Space Needle. The angles of the buildings add to this blockiness that accentuates the industrial feel of this image.” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Patrick Sloan, Renton. Photo taken: Jan. 14, Seahurst Park, Burien. Photographer’s description: “After work I decided to head to Seahurst Park and see if I could capture a nice sunset. Along the beach, I spotted this lone fisherman and thought what a great subject for a photo. I am an amateur photographer, have been taking photos for about two years. Using a Sony RX100M3 camera.” Expert says: “This photo is about the layers and is just beautiful. I love the silhouette of the fisherman against the yellow, blue and white sky. Having those logs stick out in the center of the frame makes for a unique photo; they add to the layers and anchor the frame. I can’t think of a way to make this photo better. Gorgeous find.” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Kym Ahrens, Seattle. Photo taken: Jan. 6, Lake Burien. Photographer’s description: “My workplace recently moved to Burien. I have gotten into the habit of taking my camera everywhere. One afternoon I was stunned by the beautiful, misty sunset across Lake Burien. I ran outside to get the shot, this was the best of the bunch. Sony NEX C3@35mm, 1/250, f/3.2, 800.” Expert says: “I was immediately drawn to this photo. The pastel colors are beautiful against the dark reeds. The fog softens the dark trees in the background and separates them from the reeds and their reflection, making the reeds prominent and defined. What I really enjoy is the framing and symmetry that makes this an art piece. I love how the reeds and their reflection go out of the frame on the left side and the gist of the background is at the top half of the frame, applying the rule of thirds in multiple ways. I would hang this image in my home. Gorgeous!” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Laurel Hair, Kirkland. Photo taken: Jan. 1, off Hwy. 20, Rockport, Skagit County. Photographer’s description: “My fiancé and I spent New Year’s Day eagle watching. This eagle stayed quietly watching us, allowing me the best shots of the day as I played with my new Christmas camera.” Expert says: “I love the stoicism captured. I also really enjoy all the layers: We get a sense of place with all the branches but it’s still clean because of the shallow depth of field. The limbs framing the eagle add to those nice layers. Great job!” — Katie G. Cotterill Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Shun Takano, Renton. Photo taken: Dec. 30, 2014, Renton. Photographer’s description: “Went to Gene Coulon Memorial Park with a rented lens to take photos of birds. There was a flock of North American coots, and some of the individuals decided to climb onto a log. Taken with a Sony A77M2 with Tamron 150-600 mm lens.” Expert says: “What I really like about this photo is the texture and color of the blue water that is clean and contrasts well with the smooth dark-colored birds. Great choice of lens so we’re able to get in close to the birds and see those red eyes. A tip: Almost want to be a little closer. By checking the metadata, it looks like this photo was taken at 400mm. I’m curious what it would look like if it was shot a little tighter. 500mm? Even at 600mm? I still want to see those ripples in the water, but have those (creepy) red eyes a little bigger in the frame. ” —Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Tom Schonhoff, Seattle. Photo taken: Dec. 14, 2014. Magnolia, looking toward the downtown skyline. Photographer’s description: “On foggy winter mornings, early light mixes with rapidly shifting fog to reveal Seattle in surprising ways. I gave up the iconic Space Needle and ferry boats to give focus to the tree shadows slicing through the fog. Black and white lets the viewer concentrate on the textures and contrasts, which are really the subject of the image.” Expert says: “I very much enjoy a good black and white photograph and this is one of them. I love how the light ‘slices’ through the fog and the trees. We definitely get to concentrate on the softness of the fog and the crisp rigid darkness of the trees and industrial buildings. And that bird’s silhouette is perfect. A tip: Try cropping from the left just to the first building, and from the top, just above the sun. My eye kept wandering to the flat sky and by slightly cropping we direct the focus to the subject of the image. ” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Kyle Szegedi, Bellingham. Photo taken: Nov. 1, Snoqualmie Falls. Photographer’s description: “This photo was taken on a cold day at Snoqualmie Falls. Me and my buddy made the drive down just so I could take this photo. The camera was a Canon 60D and a ND400 filter to get the long exposure. It was cool to have him stand in the shot to get the human perspective next to the waterfall. The alpine glow was amazing that sunset.” Expert says: “Snoqualmie Falls is one of the Pacific Northwest’s beauties and the photographer captured it perfectly. Great job using the neutral-density filter to get that long exposure during bright sunlight (if this wasn’t used, it would be very hard to not blow out the highlights). I love the colors: the blues in the shadows of the water, which contrast nicely with the yellows of the sunlight, and the green moss and brush. Having the friend in the frame is a little added element that I enjoy. Gorgeous frame!” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff Photographer: Aaron Roche, Seattle. Photo taken: Dec. 1, Jefferson Park, Seattle. Photographer’s description: “Silhouetted skateboarders atop Beacon Hill stole the beauty of this sunset. Shot with a Sony ILCE-6000 Hybrid camera with a 16-50mm Power Zoom lens.” Expert says: “The photographer did a great job silhouetting this skateboarder while capturing the peak action. I love the rest of the silhouettes in the background of the people and lamp post — it gives the photo a sense of place. The colors are beautiful and the wisp of clouds, especially in the top half of the photo, nicely fill out the frame’s dead space. This very well-timed moment makes this photo clean and a winner in my book.” — Katie G. Cotterill, Seattle Times photo staff 0 of 0 Katie G.
