Tomatoes, which are rich in umami – the so-called fifth taste along with sweet, sour, salty and bitter – should be relatively resistant to the white noise on an aircraft, which might explain why so many travellers order tomato juice or Bloody Marys in flight.\nLuís Mendes, Bar Manager at the Ritz Bar at Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon, took these scientific findings into consideration when putting together his re-energising “Jet Fuel” mocktail, Cloud9. Packed with anti-oxidants, vitamins, calcium, potassium and magnesium, and finalised with a few drops of Tabasco – as the hot sauce tickles nerve endings in the nose to enhance the smell and tastebuds – the Cloud9 is the perfect ally to help travellers fight jet lag.\n“So, after the seatbelt sign has been turned off, and the Four Seasons Jet air attendant asks if you fancy a drink, ask for a Cloud9, sit back and enjoy your flight” says Mendes.\nDidn’t manage to book a seat on the latest Four Seasons Private Jet Experience? Join the fun at the Ritz Bar and try the high-flying Cloud9 instead, and follow the Four Seasons Private Jet with #FSJet.\nCloud9 Cocktail from Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon\n5 cl of cucumber and celery juice\n2 cl of orange juice\n2 cl of tomato juice\n4 cl of carrot juice\n4 drops of Tabasco\nCrushed ice\nEquipment: 2 cocktail shakers, 1 strainer\nVigorously shake fresh cucumber, celery and orange juices in a cocktail shaker, then pour into a tall glass filled with crushed ice.\nIn another cocktail shaker, mix the tomato and carrot juices together, and finalise with the 4 drops of Tabasco. Use a strainer and gently pour the mixture into the glass.\nGarnish with a razor-thin slice of cucumber, celery and a cherry tomato on a toothpick.\nServing suggestion: Serve the Cloud 9 with walnuts; walnuts are a good source of tryptophan, a sleep-enhancing amino acid that helps make serotonin and melatonin, the “body clock” hormone that sets sleep-wake cycles. Additionally, University of Texas researchers found that walnuts contain their own source of melatonin, which may help one fall asleep faster.\nAbout Luís Mendes, Bar Manager at Ritz Bar\nBar Manager Luís Mendes at Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon is an alfacinha de gema, meaning a true Lisbon native. He was born and raised in Lisbon and has been in love with the city since. Having worked in both Portugal and Italy, he has always liked to pay homage to the classics while leaving his thumbprint, giving them his own personal twist, with a touch of creativity and innovation. Before taking the helm at the Ritz Bar, he honed his skills at the Estoril Bar of the Hotel Palácio – an established classic in the coastal region of Estoril & Cascais, Lapa Palace Hotel in Lisbon, and in the classic Belmond Cipriani Hotel in Venice. When not behind the counter, one can find Luis surfing the beaches of Portugal’s Atlantic coast.\nAbout the Ritz Bar\nThe Ritz Bar has Portuguese artist Pedro Leitão to thank for its cosy, artistic ambience and inspirational additions, such as his piano – autographed by world-acclaimed artists such as couturier Pierre Cardin, Fado singer Amália Rodrigues, ballerina Margot Fonteyn and actress Zsa Zsa Gábor – and a large wine-inspired tapestry. With an extensive wine list, a unique selection of ports and the best premium gin menu in Lisbon, the Ritz Bar is an ideal spot to meet for drinks or a light bite, both inside and on the terrace overlooking Eduardo VII Park. The Bar menu includes a choice of traditional Portuguese dishes and tapas, burgers, bagels, salads, pasta and risotto, among others, as well as freshly prepared sushi Wednesday through Friday.\nSource:- Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:46:16.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
