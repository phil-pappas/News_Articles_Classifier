One soldier who the lost his legs to a Taliban bomb and went on to compete in the Invictus Games for injured injured military personnel, has been wheelchair bound for seven months while waiting for his limbs to be refitted. Another soldier said he had been recently reduced to holding one limb on with his hands because of the delay for the NHS to remould the sockets which hold his leg. Relatives of veterans affected have now launched a petition calling for better care and complaining that levels of care fall sharply once injured troops leave the Forces. Smith is now left wheelchair bound while he waits (SWNS) Clive Smith, 29, who lost both his legs above the knee in 2010 while on a Helmand bomb-clearing patrol with 33 Engineer Regiment, learnt to walk unaided with prosthetic limbs. Last year he represented Britain at cycling in Prince Harry’s Olympics-style games for veterans. He has been confined to a wheelchair for the past eight months however, waiting first for surgery to his stumps which had become covered in painful blisters and now for the sockets to be remoulded. Mr Smith, of Cannock, Staffs, said: “It's so disheartening. I was promised a certain level of care when I was discharged and it hasn't been delivered. \"It's been a massive frustration for me and all the others affected. \"The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes really good care of injured veterans, they have it down to a fine art. \"The NHS just doesn't provide the same level of care.” Smith, sixth right, in a shoot for the invictus Games His girlfriend Jennifer Price, 29, has accused medics of \"sheer incompetence\". She said: \"I’m absolutely livid. Clive doesn't want anything more than to live a normal life. \"He was serving Queen and country and all he asks in return is to be able to walk again. \"These prosthetics cost a fortune and they are literally gathering dust in the house.” MoD figures show 275 troops lost limbs during the Afghan campaign and many lost more than one. Prosthetic limbs costing as much as £40,000 each are fitted at the military’s Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey , but once injured veterans leave the military, they are in the care of the NHS. The limbs can last for years, but the sockets that fit them to the body can need regularly remoulding and refitting as the wearer changes size, or develops growths or pressure sores. Prosthetic limbs Photo: Eddie Mulholland/The Telegraph Prosthetic limbs at Headley Court (Eddie Mulholland/The Telegraph) Scott Yarrington, 30, of Walsall, said he had been waiting months for his sockets to be remoulded. The former Irish Guards soldier who lost both legs in December 2010 said he had needed to hold his leg on during one recent walk, because it now fits so badly. He said: “Any where I have got to walk a long distance, is pretty much a no no, unless I take my wheelchair, which is really demoralising. I am still using my prosthetics, but I am struggling.” Mike Hookem, UKIP’s defence spokesman, said: “This is hardly a bolt out of the blue for the NHS: they have known for years when service personnel leave the military they are the responsibility of the NHS. \"If we can spend trillions sending troops to a questionable war then the least we can do is look after the ones who come back injured. I suspect that an increasing number will instead be forced to rely on military charities to pick up the government's work.” A spokesman for NHS England said: “All veterans are entitled to priority NHS treatment for any condition related to their service. We are working closely with rehabilitation centres to ensure that veterans are able to access high quality care as quickly and easily as possible.” @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T05:17:40.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
