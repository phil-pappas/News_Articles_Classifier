While the heaviest rainfall will remain to the south, as much as 25 mm (1 inch) of rain could fall in Copiapo. This amount of rainfall would be quite impressive as the region generally averages only 25 mm (1 inch) or less of rainfall per year. \nOne place that will again receive significant precipitation from these storms is the Andes. \nThe mountains between Santiago and Puerto Montt will receive copious amounts of moisture from these systems. Several inches of moisture will produce a meter (3 feet) or more of snow in the highest terrain. \nFollowing the final push of rain into Chile for the end of next week, the stormy weather will set it sights on north-central Argentina and southern Uruguay from Friday into early next week. \nRounds of rain will enhance the threat for flooding as the hardest hit areas will receive 75-150 mm (3-6 inches) of rain. Areas that could see flooding rainfall include Cordoba, Buenos Aires and Uruguay. \nSantiago will likely settle back into a dry pattern following the upcoming rain. Looking back, that has been the trend across the region for the past several winters. \n\"Santiago hasn't had above-normal yearly rainfall since 2002,\" Miller said. \"Some years were near normal, but Santiago has continued to see rainfall well below average since 2006 .\" \nThe extended dry weather has prompted some regions of Chile to contemplate water rationing, according to La Tercera. Executives stated that the rationing would depend on how the weather continues over the next month or so, but that some sort of conservation is likely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:52:18.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
