A tropical storm alert also remains in effect for the central Bahamas, which includes Long Island, Cat Island, Exuma, San Salvador and Rum Cay. A tropical storm alert means that tropical storm conditions can possibly be experienced in those islands within the next 60 hours. \nIt is important to note that The Bahamas is an archipelago with more than 700 islands and cays, spread over 100,000 square miles. There could be a tropical storm or hurricane warning for the southern islands and the central and northern islands remain unaffected. In essence, hurricanes rarely affect the entire country. \nAll hotels and resorts throughout The Islands Of The Bahamas have activated their hurricane programs and are taking all necessary precautions to protect visitors and residents alike. \nAll airports throughout The Bahamas remain open. All Bahamasair flights on Saturday, August 29, to Long Island, Acklins and Crooked Island will be cancelled and on Sunday, August 30 all fights to Long Island, San Salvador, Exuma and will be cancelled. All other flights will operate as usual until further notice. There are currently no cruise line itinerary changes for The Bahamas. \nErika is expected to move over Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and if its center tracks over the mountains of both countries, this could have a diminishing effect by ripping apart or disrupting the circulation which may weaken Ericka to a tropical wave or remnant. Beyond that, there is a large amount of uncertainty due to an upper level weather flow near the Eastern seaboard next week. \nAt 200 PM AST (1800 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erika was located near latitude 16.5 North, longitude 63.8 West. Erika is moving toward the west near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn toward the west-northwest is forecast later today, and this general motion should continue for the next 48 hours. On the forecast track, the center of Erika will move near the Virgin Islands later today, move near or over Puerto Rico tonight, and move near or over the Dominican Republic on Friday. \nMaximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48 hours. \nFor more information on Tropical Strom Erika and The Islands Of The Bahamas travel professionals and consumers are advised to access the following:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:01:26.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
