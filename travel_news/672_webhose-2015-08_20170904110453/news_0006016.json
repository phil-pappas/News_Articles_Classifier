They were taken to a hospital, where the older man was pronounced dead. The other was in critical condition Monday, police said.\nNeither man was a University of Hawaii student, Meisenzahl said.\nA student who lived at the dorm had people over, and the two men were among them, Meisenzahl said. Their names were not released.\nThe university is investigating whether any violations of the student code occurred, Meisenzahl added.\n\"It's a terrible tragedy — the last thing we want to happen ... whether they are students or not,\" he said. \"Of course, our condolences go out to their friends and family.\"\nThe school year hasn't started yet, so only about 20 students — those in need of transitional housing between the summer and fall semesters — were living in the two towers that make up the Hale Wainani dorm. They were scheduled to move out Sunday for cleaning ahead of the fall semester.\nDuring the school year, the dorm houses more than 600 students. Those arriving for the upcoming semester are scheduled to move in to the dorms Tuesday and Friday.\nOn Monday afternoon, there were mostly maintenance workers and cleaning staff outside Hale Wainani getting ready for students to move in.\nThe university's flagship campus in Honolulu's Manoa neighborhood is generally a commuter school without much of a fraternity scene, Meisenzahl said. About 4,000 of its 18,000 students live in campus housing.\n___\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:12:14.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
