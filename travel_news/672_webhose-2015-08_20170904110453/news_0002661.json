PUBLISHED: 14:09, Thu, Aug 13, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:22, Thu, Aug 13, 2015 \nInspired by Men in Black, Air New Zealand’s latest safety instalment features All Black’s Captain Richie McCaw and Dan Carter as intergalactic agents, as well as a cameo performance from former England Captain Martin Johnson. \nStarring alongside the two long-serving All Blacks, full-back Israel Dagg got to test his vocals with Kiwi musician Stan Walker. \nClearly impressed by his team mate, McCaw said: “We had a lot of laughs on set and were blown away by Israel’s hidden singing talent. If rugby doesn’t work out for him he clearly has a promising career as a back-up singer.” \nAmerican actor Rip Torn reprises his role as Chief of the Men in Black with Wallabies great David Campese, and former Argentinean Captain Agustin Pichot also making appearances. FS Israel Dagg and Stan Walker in Air New Zealand's safety video \nEngland Captain Martin Johnson admitted he's bound to take some flack for the clip. \n“I’m sure English rugby fans will have a few words to say about my appearance alongside the All Blacks too,” he said. \nWhile Campese shared his sentiment, saying: “I’m expecting to get a right ribbing from my mates for appearing in a video promoting the All Blacks, Australia’s key opponents. They’ll never let me live it down.” \nMen in Black Safety Defenders will be progressively rolled out across Air New Zealand’s fleet from today.
