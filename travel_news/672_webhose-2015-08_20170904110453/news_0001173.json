The Premium Economy cabin on the airline’s B777 aircraft will also undergo a major redesign, providing more legroom than any other Australian airline and a new Premium Larder. Travelport’s Rich Content and Branding solution will enable Virgin Australia to communicate the features of these exciting new products and services to all Travelport-connected agencies globally using both text and graphics.\nVirgin Australia Chief Commercial Officer Judith Crompton said: “We are committed to delivering a superior experience for our guests at all times on their journey.
