Markets targeted include India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia as well as regions in Europe and North America. \n\nAt the same time, Royal Caribbean intends to increase frequency of sailings from Singapore to over 40 a year, which will be augmented by its 3,807-guest Mariner of the Seas when she begins her biggest-ever deployment in October for the next Singapore season. \n\nSean Treacy, managing director, Singapore and South-east Asia of Royal Caribbean Cruises, said: “Having deployed ships here regularly for the last seven years, Royal Caribbean now looks forward to its next phase of significant growth in Singapore. Our three-year deployment plan is our strongest commitment ever to this market and we see great potential in Singapore as a source market and regional cruise hub.” \n\nSTB, assistant chief executive (business development group), Neeta Lachmandas, said: “The tripartite collaboration is a significant development not just for Singapore but also for South-east Asia. We hope Royal Caribbean’s commitment will inspire new cruise itineraries around the region to offer more reasons for travellers to take to cruising, and also motivate our neighbouring ports and destinations to invest and realise fully the tremendous potential of the Asian cruise industry.” \n\nLim Ching Kiat, senior vice president for market development at CAG, said: “This collaboration represents the synergistic efforts by CAG, Royal Caribbean and STB to effectively tap fly-cruise traffic from across the globe and serve as a cruise hub for Asia. Changi Airport will continue to leverage on its network and work with airlines and travel (consultants) to promote fly-cruise packages through Singapore.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:36:58.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
