MIA and FPLS officials hosted a press conference on August 25 to unveil the project, which is one of the largest energy-saving programs ever in the state of Florida and in the eastern U.S.\nFrom left to right: Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González explains the Sustainability Project at MIA; Assistant Director for Facilities Management Carlos Jose and Director Emilio T. González tour the cooling tower at MIA’s Central Chiller Plant. Hi-res images are available upon request.\n“The Sustainability Project at MIA is one of the greatest projects the County has ever undertaken to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint within South Florida,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez. “The cost savings and energy conservation will also provide huge benefits to our airport, its tenants and passengers, and the environment as a whole.”\nOver the next two years, the project will install $32 million worth of air conditioning and ventilation upgrades, water conservation retrofits, energy-efficient lighting, and other green initiatives at MIA that will save the airport more than $40 million in utility costs over the 14-year agreement with FPLS. In terms of environmental conservation, the project will reduce annual carbon emissions at MIA by the equivalent of 5,110 automobiles and water consumption equal to 28 million gallons of water (or 43 Olympic-size swimming pools). In addition to achieving massive energy savings, the project will create more than 300 new jobs during installation.\n“As one of the largest energy consumers in Miami-Dade County, we are implementing measures like the Sustainability Project to be its most efficient consumer as well,” said Miami-Dade Aviation Director Emilio T. González. “In addition to protecting our environment, being an energy-smart airport is smart business. The $40 million in savings will help us to decrease our operating costs and lessen the financial burden passed on to current and prospective airlines, which in turn supports our growth and our local economy. I applaud Assistant Aviation Director Carlos Jose and our Facilities Management and Engineering Division for working with FPL Services to launch this innovative program, which will further strengthen MIA’s position as a global leader in airport sustainability.”\n“With over 25 years committed to preserving, protecting and enhancing the environment, FPL Services provides industry-leading energy expertise, operational discipline and innovative solutions and technologies to our customers,” said Alex Acosta of FPL Services. “Our innovative and customized sustainability program designed for Miami International Airport’s continued commitment to green initiatives through energy conservation and reduction of water consumption will help elevate the airport’s environmental record as well as its leadership in the aviation industry.”\nThe Sustainability Project is also part of Miami-Dade County’s community-wide GreenPrint initiative to use less water and energy.\nSource:- MIA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:01:52.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
