After more than ten years' efforts, the number of radial tires has increased signifcantly. For instance, in 2000, only 32% of passenger cars had radial tires but the figure rose to over 90% in 2014. The Policy of the Tire Industry published by The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China requires that by 2015, all passenger cars shall be equipped with radial tires, so do 85% of light trucks and 90% of trucks.\nEver since China entered WTO, its automobile industry has developed fast, which has driven the development of tire industry. In 2014, China ranked first in automobile output and sales in the world: 23.7229 million cars were produced, increasing 7.3% year on year and 23.4919 million were sold, increasing 6.9% year on year. And China has been the world's largest car producer and car market for six years since 2009. Its civil car ownership has keep rising too, reaching 154.47 million (9.72 million tricars and low-speed trucks included) by the end of 2014.\nAlthough China has been the world's largest auto market for six years since 2009, its car ownership per capita was only about 110 per thousand people in 2014, far less than 600-800 per thousand people in developed countries. China's auto output and sales are expected to grow at an annual rate of over 5%. And as the car output and ownership increases, the growth rate of tire market will exceed 15%. In the automobile tire market as well as the service market, the demand for substitute tires doubles that for accessory products and accounts for two thirds of the market share.\nAs China already has a complete industrial chain of tire and its labor force is much lower than that in developed countries, its tire industry still has a great advantage over that in other developing countries. And it is expected that in the near future, the domestic demand for tire and its export will keep growing. Although China's tire industry faces many problems, it still has big potential of growth and good prospects for development due to Chinese government's policy support.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1 Basic Concepts of Tire Industry\n2 Development Environment of Tire Industry in China , 2010-2015\n3 Supply Analysis of Tire Industry in China , 2010-2014\n4 Demand Analysis of Tire Industry in China , 2010-2014\n5 Analysis and Forecast of Chinese Tire Import and Export, 2010-2019\n6 Major Transnational Companies and Their Operation Status in Tire Market in China , 2011-2015\n7 Analysis of Major Local Enterprises in Tire Market in China , 2010-2014\n8 Forecast on Investment in and Development of Tire Industry in China , 2015-2019\nCompanies Mentioned\n- Aeolus Tyre Co., Ltd- Bridgestone- Cheng Shin Tire- Cooper Tire- Double Coin Holdings Limited- Doublestar tire- Giti- Goodyear- Guizhou Tyre Co., Ltd- Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Ltd- Hankook Tire- Kumho Tire- Ling Long Group- Michelin- Pirellie- Sailun Group- Shandong Jinyu Tire Co., Ltd- Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd- Triangle Tyre Co., Ltd- Yokohama\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/p92mg5/research_report\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/china-tire-industry-research-report-2015---outlook-to-2019-300129139.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/p92mg5/research_report", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-tire-industry-research-report-2015---outlook-to-2019-300129139.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN80536&Transmission_Id=201508170810PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN80536&DateId=20150817"], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:36:50.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
