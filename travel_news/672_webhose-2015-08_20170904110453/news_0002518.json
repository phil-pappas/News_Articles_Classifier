Around 17 per cent spend more than 45 minutes searching for the right hotel with the average coming in at 34 minutes.\nThe study revealed that business travellers’ habits are changing for how they want to be rewarded by companies for brand loyalty. 74 per cent of respondents in the US and 61 per cent globally said they want hotels to remember travel patterns and preferences from one visit to the next, although almost half of those surveyed added that hotels ‘don’t understand my travel habits and preferences’.\nThe online study was conducted among 8,030 business travellers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, UK and US.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-03T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:18:07.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
