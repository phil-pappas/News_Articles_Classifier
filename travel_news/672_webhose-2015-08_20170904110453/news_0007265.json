Ever fancied hurtling down a hill lying flat on an oversized skateboard? Of course you have! The good news is – now you can not only do it, but it’s actually recognised as a legitimate sport in its own right. Street luge is one of those activities that’s so straight-up crazy it almost demands to be given a go. The principles are about as basic as they come: find a hill, lie on what is basically a plank of wood with wheels on it, keep going until you hit the bottom… and hope you don’t hit anything else on the way down. Tempted? Here are some more facts about the most exciting sport you’ve never tried. Street luge is celebrating its 20th year as a sport in this country. It was introduced to the UK after featuring in the X Games (a kind of extreme sports Olympics) in America. It originated in California (of course) when a group of bored skateboarders looking for greater thrills, decided simply to lie on their boards and take on some big hills. They found that the technique gave them greater speed, more control… and a far bigger adrenaline rush than traditional skateboarding. Street luge is terrific fun – but it is a dangerous sport: racers can reach speeds of up to 80 mph Modern street luge boards are now longer, with wider trucks and bigger wheels in order to maximise safety (it’s alarmingly easy to fall off a standard-sized skateboard) as well as to increase speed and power. The principles couldn’t be simpler. The racer lies on his back on the board with feet pointing forward, steers by shifting his weight from side to side, and uses his feet as brakes. Thick soled shoes are therefore a good idea. Given its origins as a DIY sport, many street lugers still design and make their own boards – and the internet has plenty of resources, plans and help for those who want to build their own. As a beginner, however, you may feel more comfortable with a ready-made board to start with. The last thing you want is for your home-made kit to fall apart on you halfway down the hill. Street luge is terrific fun – but it is a dangerous sport: racers can reach speeds of up to 80 mph and when you’re speeding that fast just inches off the ground, any crashes will seriously hurt. It’s therefore essential to invest in motorbike leathers and a helmet.
