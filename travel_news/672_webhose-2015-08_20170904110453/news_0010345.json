The airline is to add four new 787-9 Dreamliners in 2016, five in 2017 and two in 2018. \nThe airline’s 787-9s will have 344 seats including 35 in premium economy and 309 in economy. \nNorwegian CEO Bjorn Kjos said: “In order to make our long-haul operation even more competitive, we are dependent on more brand new cost-efficient aircraft. \n“Our long-haul routes have been very popular and I´m very satisfied to have secured more Dreamliners. This will enable us to launch even more routes to exiting destinations all over the world.” \nNorwegian last month announced that it was planning to set up a UK subsidiary as it seeks to expand its low-cost long-haul model.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T14:15:34.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
