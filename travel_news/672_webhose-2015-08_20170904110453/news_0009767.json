At the zoo, one is expected to reward the crocodiles for lying very still and playing dead. A few coins tossed into their pool will be appreciated. When you check into your hotel room, the porter will hang around after showing you where the bed is, how the bathroom taps work, where the ironing board is kept, how the curtains open and close, etc. He appreciates it if you reciprocate by demonstrating the clever way your suitcase zips up.

If you disagree with your taxi driver’s political views, you may halve his tip. He will see this as a mark of respect. “Reverse tipping” is catching on in parts of the country. When leaving a restaurant, if you feel your treatment has been offhand, you may help yourself to a £2 coin from the cloakroom saucer. And if you come across a busker whose playing is truly dreadful, you should take some money from the collection by his feet as a fine. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:13:01.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
