Watching woozy smartphone footage of people experiencing minor discomfort turned out to be an unexpectedly compelling form of entertainment, and the Ice Bucket Challenge became one of the most viral and shareable online campaigns in history. But no-one saw it coming, and it added more layers of complexity to the already vexed question of how organisations and businesses can make a splash on social media. Huge resources are devoted to achieving that kind of resonance on Facebook and Twitter, and it’s easy to see why: social media users spend an average of 1.72 hours per day looking – either actively or passively – to be entertained. But the rules that determine which things gain traction and which don’t are exceedingly vague, and while a huge amount has been written about achieving the holy grail of viral success, it’s often down to factors beyond anyone’s control. “You can’t enter social media with the hope that everything you do is going to go viral,” says Jan Rezab, CEO of social media analytics firm Socialbakers, “because it’s not. The reality is that social media is about hard effort, about having a deep dialogue with your community and building those relationships. Social media isn’t Facebook, Twitter and YouTube – social media is people.” The best way for a brand to tell its story is to use the people who live and breathe that brand It’s also about creating content for those people. Social media has rewritten the rules of marketing in many ways, and one of them, according to Mr Rezab, is the way businesses now have to become media publishers. \"Of course, companies struggle,\" he says. \"They don't all have content-creating abilities, and some will make the mistake of outsourcing the work. The best way for a brand to tell its story is to use the people who live and breathe that brand.\" There is some broad consensus as to what makes a piece of content eminently shareable. Emotional arousal is key; recent successful campaigns by Nike , Dove and Turkish Airlines combine sentimental music and affecting personal stories to seduce us into passing on the links. While SME budgets don’t stretch to those kind of production values, compelling storytelling can be done cheaply; remember that Wren Studios made the most-viewed fashion film of all time for just $1,500 (£960). Being funny is another route to viral success – although it’s not as easy to hit those marks; a much-satirised advert for Ojai Valley Taxidermy was a huge SME success – but again, the reasons for it becoming so widely shared are hard to pin down. Ultimately, businesses need to remember that the act of sharing a piece of content online is about those potential customers projecting an image of who they’d like to be. “The most shareable content you’ll find online comes from sports teams,” says Mr Rezab, by way of illustration. “Major league baseball, soccer, WWF. There’s huge virality there, and it’s all down to self-expression. The desperation of businesses to achieve viral resonance can lead them across some dangerous minefields, as illustrated by the Condescending Corporate Brands page on Facebook . Marc Maley, CEO of social media analysis firm Fuel Intelligence, believes that a more measured, level-headed approach is key. “Campaigns that try to start as viral often fail,” he says. “Much social content is disposable, and staying in someone’s feed is very challenging. Social needs to be one factor of a larger marketing campaign across multiple marketing channels to gain the most traction.” There’s also the thorny problem of assessing the effect of a viral and working out whether it had any tangible effect on your business – after all, most of us know of the Ice Bucket Challenge, but how many can remember which charities it was done in aid of? “It’s not enough to just run a campaign and see what happens,” says Mr Maley. “Tracking social media during your campaign and refining it to meet that demographic is key to measuring and affecting success. Once the dust has settled, go back to your general monitoring and see if that audience has grown. Analyse who they are and market accordingly.” The truth is that very few people use social media to discover brand content. But they are looking to be diverted, and there's a huge opportunity for brands to step in and fill that gap with things that people remember, discuss, or derive some practical value from. The magic formula to create those things, however, will remain stubbornly elusive. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • How SMEs can make the most of sports sponsorship • Top seedfunding tips for SMEs • Five ways to battle cybercrime • Five ways for SMEs to motivate staff to save costs • How to run a successful virtual office", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:01:49.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
