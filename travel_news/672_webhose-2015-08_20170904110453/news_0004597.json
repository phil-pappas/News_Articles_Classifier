This working-class area has been trumpeted as up-and-coming since the Berlin Wall came down 26 years ago. But at last this 3.5-square-mile district is showing signs of delivering on that promise.\nMany of the new, noteworthy Wedding businesses serve night owls — which might be just as well. Despite the Unesco-protected, Weimer-era minimalist architecture of the Schillerpark Settlement and the occasional grand houses from the 19th-century that survived World War II, much of this northwestern neighborhood remains not too easy on the eye, making it perhaps best experienced in the dark.\nThe transformation of Wedding, named after a 13th-century nobleman, began around Gericht Street, where a derelict municipal swimming pool was reincarnated in 2009 as an exhibition space named Stattbad, literally “instead-pool,” where artworks hung in locker rooms, pop-up vegan supper clubs took place in corridors, and ravers danced to pulsing electronica from midnight to noon in the drained pool. Though city authorities closed its doors, citing fire code violations this summer, Stattbad helped to popularize the hodgepodge neighborhood’s reputation as edgy and nocturnal.\nPhoto A wide view over Wedding.

Follow the enigmatic, neon-green symbol hanging above the series of arches connecting the courtyards to the last quad in the complex, and you will find Panke , a gallery and club that picks up on weekends, when themed parties summon night life aficionados.\nMiko Omietanski, who has been running the monthly Wedding Soul party at Panke since 2012, calls Wedding “low-key but cool.” His event features D.J.s and musicians playing hip-hop and funk to an amped-up crowd.\nPhoto A tango studio in a converted warehouse. Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times “Wedding is still slow to change, and there are little hubs of night life between residential areas,” he said. “This is the Berlin visitors are looking for: everything is allowed and relaxed.”\nWhile expats are often blamed for fueling gentrification, Mr. Omietanski embraces out-of-towners. “People who come here deserve to have a good time,” he said, “because they found their way to Wedding.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Some Americans have not only found Wedding, but are also thriving as entrepreneurs. Vagabund Brauerei began as a home-brewing project of three American band mates who crowd-funded a pint-size brewery with a taproom outfitted with picnic tables in March 2014. Winning over German drinkers more accustomed to traditional brews that adhere to the country’s strict beer-purity law, this one-room bar offers distinctively non-Teutonic beers like Szechuan Saison, with peppercorns and coriander, and tart American Pale Ale, made with Pacific Northwest hops.\nPhoto The Teutonic version of bowling, at Kugelbahn. Credit Gordon Welters for The New York Times Vagabund’s lupulin beers contrast with the offerings of Eschenbräu , a long-beloved local brewpub with a spartan beer garden hidden behind a gray apartment block. Known for its unfiltered pils, this establishment dedicates its dark lager, containing twice the usual amount of malt and hops, to its home by proudly naming it the Weddinator.\nWedding’s libation options extend beyond beer. At the southern end of the district, bordering the fashionable Mitte, the gastro pub Volta , run by the local culinary wunderkind Stephan Hentschel, offers cocktails, as well as Asian-influenced bar bites like chicken dusted with katsuobushi (Japanese fish flakes) and Korean kimchi-jeon pancakes accompanying coconut and pea cream.\nThe grunge-cool Moritz Bar , which signaled a new chapter for Wedding in 2013 by luring gay Berliners away from their more traditional stamping grounds in the Schöneberg and Kreuzberg neighborhoods with its Monday Gay Wedding party, sticks to the area’s unpretentious air with its Caibeerinha, a Germanic spin on the zesty Brazilian drink. Studio8 has emerged as one of the city’s most acclaimed cocktail makers after its January 2013 renovation. Fitting for its minimalist décor is a chalkboard menu listing just a few cocktails each day, and occasionally experimental live music fills the room.\nWedding’s biggest draw remains its quirkiness. Up the street from Studio8 is Kugelbahn , with two basement lanes for the Teutonic cousin of bowling, now made hip by young patrons drawn to the bar’s D.J.s and live music. After knocking a few pins, you can take a 20-minute stroll down leafy Osloer Street, then along the tranquil Panke River to Wilma ,a quintessential shabby-chic Berlin bar that opened late last year. This bohemian spot presents an eclectic lineup of entertainers, like a fire eater and a balloon artist, in addition to live musicians. And this being Berlin, Wilma doubles as a gallery championing local artists.", "external_links": ["http://www.vagabundbrauerei.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/moritzbar.bln", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS4/02HEADS4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS2/02HEADS2-superJumbo.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anita-Berber/105564142987901", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/STUDIO8/268439143184456", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS3/02HEADS3-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS4/02HEADS4-articleLarge.jpg", "http://www.kugelbahn-wedding.com/", "http://eschenbraeu.de/", "http://www.pankeculture.com/", "http://dasvolta.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/wilmawedding/info?ref=page_internal", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS2/02HEADS2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/02/travel/02HEADS3/02HEADS3-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T16:03:56.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
