I carry neither the Maltese cross of the crusader nor the seashell of St. James, but rather a jaunty Marina Paisley tote of reds and blues. I make the pilgrimage to the promised land of Fort Wayne, the spiritual center for Vera Bradley believers.\nAnd it’s not just any trip, any time. This is the annual Vera Bradley Outlet Sale, the apex of Vera worship each April. Texas is one of the leaders as more than 60,000 shoppers from every state and a dozen countries converge on the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, questing for quilted cotton.\nVera Bradley accessories are an acquired addiction. Some women collect every item in their favorite patterns, while others go for the eclectic look, mixing patterns like flowers in an English country garden. Others simply cringe at the cuteness of the florals and geometrics — which leaves more for the Vera addicts. And we know who we are.\nThe blow-out sale is as old as the Hoosier company itself, dating to 1982, when Patricia R. Miller and Barbara Bradley Baekgaard first starting cutting out fabric on a ping-pong table. The sale that started in a quaint 10x10-foot tent with seconds has morphed into mountains of merchandise that cover nearly three football fields. Last year, it took 86 semis to deliver the goods.\nThe company charges admission for an assigned shopping window; toward the end of the five-day event, the doors open to all comers.\nLike an exploded kaleidoscope, color and pattern dazzle from endless tables of purses, backpacks and suitcases. Here’s the cutest baby dress, there’s the best dorm décor. It’s almost too much, so every Vera devotee needs a pilgrimage plan.\nCheck in early and often The 2016 sale is April 6-10, but the crucial opening for registration is creeping up: Feb. 1. Register at verabradley.com and, if you want to shop during the early ticketed days, buy your ticket through Ticketmaster. It’s $5 to corner a 21/2-hour time frame, just you and up to 3,300 other shoppers. Unregistered shoppers can pop in the final two days of the sale, sign up on site and take their chances.\nFollow the buzz on Facebook, Twitter and all social media — you may snag an exclusive offer. The company also tweets throughout the sale; backpacks that were originally $109 might dip to $30.\nAs soon as you lock in your shopping day, check the local hotels at VisitFortWayne.com at least two months ahead.\nMake a list It can be overwhelming to face acres of patterns stretching to the horizon line. A nailed-down list can keep you focused. If you’re the designated personal shopper for others, make sure they research the exact name of the pattern and item they want. A photo is even better.\nBring a fellow pilgrim Bargainistas often shop in groups, sporting team T-shirts or tiaras — or both. Pals are great to talk with as you wait in line, and once inside, to offer design advice. If they’re really generous, they may help you tote your overstuffed pink plastic trash bag up to the cash register. Pack your cell phones and pick a meeting spot for the post-bargain rendezvous.\nSome shoppers bring their husbands, both to help with the load and the sale limit: $3,500 per buyer for the duration of the sale. Vera takes Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, checks and cash. You’ll need registration to shop and a valid photo ID to check out.\nAsk for guidance When I hit the wall of pattern and shape, I finally turn to an aproned helper, Maureen, and whimper “I’m looking for totes.” That’s like wandering into a landscape megastore and saying “I want a tree.”\nMaureen gently takes me in hand, watching for the buckled knees and rapid pulse of a shopper trapped inside the kaleidoscope. Just by asking “With or without a zipper?” she breaks through my trance and reboots my search.\nJust look for the Vera-aproned workers and share your list with them.\nDiscover old and new For most of its life, the outlet sale was all about overstock and retired patterns at 40 to 60 percent off. For the first time in 2015, Vera manufactured current patterns just for the sale.\nBetween each ticketed time slot, stockers refresh the merchandise and bring out hot items. “It’s like they’re coming into a fresh new sale,” said Vera Bradley’s Melissa Schenkel.\nFor new merchandise, catch the free, hourly Vera shuttle from the coliseum to the Vera shop at Jefferson Pointe Shopping Center. The bus rollicks with games and daily deals on new Vera.\nDrivers can copy the locals and park at the shopping center to save $5 on coliseum parking. Shoppers who fly in get a special treat: Airport volunteers hand new arrivals locally baked cookies.\nSpread the wealth Peg Perego, another Fort Wayne company that crafts high-end children’s toys and gear, stages its outlet sale to coincide with Vera’s. DeBrand Fine Chocolates, a delicious energy boost for hard-shopping folk, offers tours.\nFeel good about shopping Make a $2 donation to the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer by buying a chance on a handmade quilt or a travel set. The company has raised more than $23 million to endow a chair at the Simon Medical Center in Indianapolis and fund research at the Indiana University School of Medicine.\nPack it in The U.S. Postal Service is onsite, ready to ship your treasures home. Opening the package will be like reliving the epiphany that is the Vera Bradley Outlet Sale. .\nBetsa Marsh is a freelance writer in Ohio.\nWhen you go The Vera Bradley Outlet Sale is April 6-10, 2016, at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, 4000 Parnell Ave. on the north side of Fort Wayne, Ind. verabradley.com .
