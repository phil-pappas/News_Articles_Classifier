This investment will create 10 local jobs during construction and once complete, the facility will be capable of hosting up to 2,000 people for festivals, concerts, the local farmer’s market and cultural events.\nAn additional investment of more than $687,000 from the NOHFC will support enhancements to the Cochrane Polar Bear Habitat including improved live streaming, perimeter fencing and bear holding upgrades that will support conservation and education about Ontario’s polar bear population.\n“We couldn’t be more excited about the significant developments taking place in our community over the next year,” Cochrane Mayor Peter Politis stated in the government release. “To be receiving over $1.6 million from the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund is a testament to how much the fund and the Minister of Northern Development and Mines believe in us as a community and as a northern region.\n“These investments will not only help position Cochrane’s important tourism industry for years to come, but will also assist in our community’s social development as well. I want to thank Minister (Michael) Gravelle for continuing to be a catalyst for Cochrane’s progressive path to development and to the sustainability of our cherished way of life.”\nGravelle, who is Ontario Minister of Northern Development and Mines, also serves as NOHFC chairman.\nThis funding, according to the release, is part of the largest infrastructure investment in Ontario’s history — more than $130 billion over 10 years, which will support more than 110,000 jobs per year on average, with projects such as roads, bridges, transit systems, schools and hospitals across the province.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:24:57.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
