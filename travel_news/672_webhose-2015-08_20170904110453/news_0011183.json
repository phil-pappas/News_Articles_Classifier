It is perfect roadtrip country with something truly special to see at almost every turn. You can go in the opposite direction, but it makes sense to tour clockwise from Corinth to Olympia ignoring the motorway that carves down the centre to Kalamata as much as possible. Head straight on past the isthmus and you’ll soon discover the mighty citadel of Mycenae, one of the major centres of Greek civilisation between 1600-1100BC. This is where Homeric legend and history merge, as it often does in the Peloponnese. Scenic delight: Voidokilia beach, Messinia Photo: Region of Pelponnese Mycenae was ruled by the mythic king Agamemnon and here just outside the main ruins you will also find the huge vaulted Treasury of Atreus, one of the most impressive preserved Mycenaean tholos tombs. The ruins, a Unesco World Heritage Site, are entered through the imposing Lion Gate and the famous Cyclopean walls. Inside there’s the royal palace, more tombs and various merchant houses. Take a left towards the Saronic Gulf and soon you’ll reach another Unesco site at Epidaurus. It is perfect roadtrip country with something truly special to see at almost every turn Here you’ll find the impressive ruins of an ancient health cult, crowned by the best-preserved ancient temple theatre in Greece, a masterpiece of Greek architecture set in a lush, natural bowl with perfect acoustics. It seats 13,000 and is the scene of a major annual drama festival today, the Athens and Epidaurus Festival. After all those ruins one of the most beautiful spots to stay over in Argolis is Nafplio. It was once a launching point for ancient nautical expeditions, flourished during the Byzantine era but was also variously settled by Venetians, Franks and Turks. The Palamidi Castle above town offers a fantastic panorama of the gulf but its most photographed spot is the Bourtzi, a small Venetian fortress on a rocky islet reached by water taxi. Ancient: Methoni Castle Heading back towards the centre of the peninsula lies Arcadia, the region that gave its name to harmonious natural perfection in Renaissance art. It’s a beautiful, unspoiled landscape of hills dotted with medieval towns, notably Karitena. Drive further south and a short distance from famed Sparta you’ll reach the magical Byzantine town of Mystras, sat atop Mount Taygetos. Founded in the 13th century and resettled numerous times until it was abandoned in 1832, this Unesco World Heritage Site is well worth the hike uphill to explore its atmospheric, labyrinthine alleys, palaces, houses and churches, several of which contain fine, if faded, frescoes. Venture further south and you’ll discover Mani, a long finger of land and a naturally fortified landscape once populated by clans who played an important role in overthrowing the Turks in 1821. The area is teeming with striking tower houses, Byzantine chapels, monasteries, ruins and some lovely coves and deep caves. Stop off at Limeni, a picturesque little port and austere Areopoli overlooked by the Mavromichalis tower. The Diros caves a couple of miles from Pyrgos Dirou conceal a subterranean world much of which must be explored by boat. Finally you can go no further. Cape Tainaron is the southernmost point of mainland Greece and the second most southerly point of Europe. Here the Tainaron lighthouse warns ships of rocky shores. Marmari and Porto Kagio nearby, have superb sandy beaches with clear waters. Medieval: Monemvasia Around the next spur of land past Kalamata you’ll find two beautiful historic towns overlooking the Ionian Sea - Methoni and Koroni. The former has a striking Venetian castle on a rock promontory at the water’s edge, the latter an entire fortress. Take the spectacular coast road back along the west of the peninsula and you’ll pass some fine, undeveloped beaches along with forested mountains inland boasting lush valleys and gorges. Keep on and you’ll eventually see the sign for Olympia, the ancient town and sanctuary dedicated to the gods. Here’s the riches include the massive temple of Zeus, the largest temple in the Peloponnese, the remains of the temple of Hera, the gymnasium and the Krypte, the entrance to the stadium that was the scene of the Olympic games for a millennium. The adjacent museum contains some of the most important artefacts in the country. Heading north you can reach central mainland Greece this time via the ultra modern Rio-Antirio bridge, opened in 2011 and the longest fully suspended cable stay in the world - a reminder that Greece is not all about its past. • Read more about Greek travel at Holidays in Greece", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T20:54:10.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
