With endlessly deep pockets, a startling appetite for risk, a passion for technology and a little black book bursting with A-list entrepreneurial contacts, this rare beast epitomises everything that is missing from the investment landscape in Europe – or so I’m told. Catching the attention of this special breed of VC is like reaching investment nirvana, so imagine my glee at being able to attend a real pitching session in front of several of these lauded individuals while on a recent trip to California. I was accompanying nine small companies from the UK on a trade mission to sell their space smarts to the US. Some of these companies made tiny satellites – or cubesats – that could be launched by you or me; others built Mission Control software or turned satellite imaging into useful applications for people on the ground. Attempting to gloss over the issue of rivals will infuriate the Silicon Valley VC They were being championed by the government innovation agency, Innovate UK, and the pitching session to Space Angels, the sector's specialist angel network, was an opportunity for these Brits to flex their pitching muscles. Some of the companies were looking for investment – mostly between $1m and $3m. Others were seeking partners or customers. I sat quietly at the back of the room, taking note of every quirk of the process. If you ever end up in a lift with a Silicon Valley investor or are heading over to California to pitch, here is my cheat sheet. Silicon Valley VCs interrupt Think you have got your pitch down pat? What if every few sentences someone shoots you a question, demanding more information. Would you be derailed and lose your train of thought? Many of these VCs don’t wait patiently for you to finish your five-minute spiel – they jump in when they want to. When practising your pitch, get friends or colleagues to do the same and make sure you can keep your cool. Do you own any intellectual property? This is a Silicon Valley obsession. Do you actually own the smarts powering your company? If you do not, you better have a cast-iron reason why they should not throw you out of the meeting there and then. If you are in a joint venture, could that slow your growth? The moment you say that you have created new IP, and you own it, you can see the ears of VCs prick up and they sit straighter in their seats. They know more about your competition than you do If there are companies out there vying for the same market you are, talk about them. Explain why your business is better than theirs; what is your competitive advantage? Attempting to gloss over the issue of rivals will infuriate the Silicon Valley VC. Also, remember that – if they are industry specialists – they may well know of stealth start-ups moving into the space that you have n0t heard of. Beware of saying “Only this other company does something like this” unless you are absolutely sure. Dilution, dilution, dilution US VCs love to find a cracking new company, secure a significant stake and feel confident that they will make big money from an exit down the line. Their greatest fear: dilution. Will future rounds eat away at their earnings? Be clear on how many rounds of finance you want to raise and in what time scale. Do not make foolish promises – companies that swear they will never need more money set off alarm bells quickly. What else can you do? How can your product or service be used in other industries or verticals? Sure, you are selling to X market now, but the VC wants to know that you have considered every other possible customer out there – even if it is a market you will not look at for five years or more. Can your IP be licensed out to other non-competing players? What is your 10-year plan? Why? Why? Why? Parents are often driven mad when their children ask this question over and over, trying to drill down to the truth of an issue. Prepare for a similar onslaught from the VC. Why did you focus on that technology? Why then? But why? And so on. For every decision that you have made in your business, there must be a good reason. Similarly, when raising money, do not just say what you want to spend it on but why you have prioritised these business needs over others. Good luck. You will be “awesome”. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Set your people free with the ultimate in flexible working • Confessions of a crowdfunder • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses • Building the right team for your SME • Making flexible working work", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:51:12.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
