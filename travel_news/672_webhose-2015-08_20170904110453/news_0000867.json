Delta will also review acceptance policies of other hunting trophies with appropriate government agencies and other organizations supporting legal shipments.” \nCecil the Lion was a popular animal at the Hwange National Park and an icon for conservation efforts in the region. He was controversially killed by Walter Palmer, a Minnesota dentist in early July. Zimbabwe’s wildlife minister has said that extradition is being sought for Palmer. \nWATCH: On the Frontlines of the Rhino “Genocide”: Saving A Species on the Brink Tumblr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T23:22:21.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
