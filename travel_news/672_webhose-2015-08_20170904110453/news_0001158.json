As it is the case this summer in New York, where venerable retailer Rizzoli Bookstore -- booted out of its grandiose West 57th Street premises in April 2014 -- has reopened once again. Some feared Rizzoli's flagship would be gone for good, mounting protests to decry the loss of its elaborate ceilings bedecked with chandeliers, iron-railed balconies and, of course, its well-stocked shelves. Thankfully, that didn't happen and the store now has new premises on Broadway ( 1133 Broadway at 26th Street, New York; +1 212-759-2424 ), which the owners have decked out in a similarly grand fashion. The new Rizzoli Bookstore features wallpaper exclusively designed by Fornasetti Milano. Rizzoli joins other brick-and-mortar book-selling survivors -- and brave newcomers -- that have adapted to the Age of Amazon in their own ways, from opening 24 hours to undergoing spectacular design renovations or stocking books that aren't sold by the online giant. Old or new, all with fascinating stories, the bookstores below serve as historic sites, sanctuaries, salons of culture and must-visit entries in any travel itinerary. Shakespeare and Company (Paris) Opened in 1951, this Paris Left Bank fixture looks like something straight out of a Hemingway book -- for good reason. It's the spiritual successor and namesake of the first Shakespeare and Company, run by expat American bookseller Sylvia Beach and immortalized in Hemingway's memoir, \"A Moveable Feast.\" Beach closed her store in 1941, but in 1958 gave her blessing for another -- called Le Mistral -- to take the Shakespeare and Company name. Current Shakespeare and Company owner Sylvia Whitman (pictured) was named after Sylvia Beach, owner of the first Shakespeare and Company. From its opening day, the second Shakespeare and Company has incorporated writers' residencies. Up to four scribes can spend the night in the store, with most staying a week to a month. \"My father always aspired to continue the same spirit Sylvia Beach created in her bookstore -- welcoming and hosting writers and sharing books through our reading room,\" Sylvia Whitman, daughter of founder George Whitman, tells CNN. \nShakespeare and Company Bookstore , 37 rue de la Bucherie Latin Quarter, 75005 Paris France; Eslite Dunnan Store (Taipei, Taiwan) In 1999, the first Eslite bookstore delighted the city of Taipei by staying open 24 hours a day. But the 17,000-square-meter store really made its name by stocking an impressive multi-language array of books and magazines. It's been so successful, two more Eslite branches have opened in the capital. One is the country's largest bookstore, while the other is a small city of retail areas, a commercial arcade, a theater and a music performance space. \nEslite BookstoreTunnan , 2F, No.245 Tunhua South Road, Section 1, Taipei Taiwan; Originally a theater, El Ateneo was converted into a cinema and then a bookstore. El Ateneo (Buenos Aires, Argentina) Converted into a cinema in 1929, the building that houses El Ateneo underwent its most recent rebirth into a bookstore in the early 2000s. Stunningly photogenic and vast, the majestic former theater retains its century-old ornate architecture and decor. The stage and theater boxes have been converted into reading spaces. \nEl Ateneo Grand Splendid , Av Santa Fe 1860 Barrio Recoleta, Buenos Aires Argentina; Librairie Avant-Garde (Nanjing, China) China's most beautiful bookstore is located inside a massive underground parking lot once used as a bomb shelter. The 4,000-square-meter store's unusual features include large crosses, a copy of Rodin's \"The Thinker\" and a checkout counter built out of thousands of old books. The store also functions as a sort of public library, with more than 300 reading chairs. \"A good bookshop should provide space, vision and nurture the city with its humanitarian spirit,\" owner Qian Xiaohua tells CNN. \"It's a place for people to have dreams in the city.\" \nLibrairie Avant-Garde , No.173 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing China; Luxury publisher Assouline's opened a store last year in an old palazzo in Venice. Assouline Venezia (Venice, Italy) Located on the ground floor of the Bauer Hotel, a restored 18th-century palazzo, this boutique opened by luxury publisher Assouline in 2014 is a study in beautiful interior design. The store stocks many of the label's most expensive books, such as handcrafted volumes from its Ultimate Collection -- priced from $500 to $7,000 -- which range in subject matter from fashion and architecture to travel and lifestyle. Assouline Venezia , Bauer Hotel, San Marco, Venice, Italy; +39 041 240 6876; Monday-Saturday 10:30 a.m.-7:30 p.m. Livraria Lello (Porto, Portugal) Previous incarnations of this sublime bookstore and its publishing house date to 1869, but this beauty was built in 1906 by engineer Xavier Esteves. A century later, it remains arguably the world's most beautiful bookstore, with neo-Gothic architecture incorporating stained glass, a sweeping staircase and a plaster ceiling imitating wood. It's become so popular with tourists, in July 2015 the store started charging entrance fees. A stunning panorama of the store can be seen at 360 Portugal . \nLivraria Lello & Irmao , Rua das Carmelitas 144 Vitória, Porto 4050-161 Portugal; The church housing the Boekhandel Domincanen was built in 1294. Boekhandel Dominicanen (Maastricht, Netherlands) Built in the 13th century, this 1,100-square-meter former Dominican church was converted into a bookstore in 2006. Before an award-winning redesign, the Gothic space had been used for numerous purposes: housing the Maastricht City Orchestra, hosting children's carnivals and slaughtering sheep. In addition to stocking 40,000 books in Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Italian, and pouring the best coffee in town, the store hosts approximately 140 events per year. \"There is always something happening here,\" Boekhandel Dominicanen representative Ton Harmes tells CNN. \nBoekhandel Selexyz Dominicanen , 1 Dominikanerkerk Street, 6211 Maastricht The Netherlands; Powell's City of Books (Portland, Oregon) Visitors should set aside a good two to three days to get lost in this iconic Portland landmark. The largest used and new bookstore in the world is housed inside a modest, multi-level building that takes up a full city block and is often crowded. New and used editions are shelved side by side, giving customers a handy choice of price options. The biggest names in publishing show up here to do readings and book signings -- the venue is highly sought out by authors on book tour. The staff's passion for reading shines through on the store's treasure of a website, which features an entertaining book blog in addition to a comprehensive and ambitious online store. \nPowell's City of Books , 1005 W Burnside, Portland, OR; Books for Cooks (Melbourne, Australia) Housed in a 150-year-old former sly grog shop (speakeasy) on one of Melbourne's most interesting streets, this small bookstore is the only retail shop in Australia specializing in cookbooks. Every type of cuisine and culinary category imaginable can be found on its floor-to-ceiling shelves. Treasures include several beautiful 18th-century culinary books. \"Our customers are chefs, foodies and armchair gourmets,\" co-owner Tim White tells CNN. \"We catalog more than 40,000 cookbooks and on any given day have at least 30,000 in stock.\" The store ships around the world, at cost. \nBooks for Cooks , 233 Gertrude St Queen Victoria Market, Fitzroy, Yarra, Victoria 3000 Australia; Strand (New York) Back in the 1920s, six blocks of Manhattan's Fourth Avenue were known as \"Book Row.\" Of the 48 bookstores that gave the district its name, Strand is the only survivor. After moving to its current location on Broadway and 12th Street, the beloved NYC store built up a staggering catalog that now includes 2.5 million new, used and rare books. The coolest section is the Rare Book Room. \"Our most expensive title in store right now is a copy of James Joyce's 'Ulysses' illustrated by Henri Matisse,\" marketing manager Brianne Sperber told CNN in 2014. The book was then priced at $45,000. \"People still read hardbacks and books are still collectors' items so we expect Strand will continue to fare well against Amazon,\" says Sperber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:06:46.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
