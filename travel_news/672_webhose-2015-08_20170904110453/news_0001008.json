MAKES 6 small tarts INGREDIENTS For the pastry: 100g cold butter 200g plain flour For the filling: 1 small onion 180g asparagus 2 eggs 200ml double cream 150g pecorino METHOD To make the pastry, chop the butter into small cubes and toss it into a mixing bowl. Sift in the flour and a pinch of salt, then rub the butter into the flour with your fingers until it takes on the consistency of sand. Add 3-4 tablespoons of water, little by little, bringing the dough together with your hands. If the dough is crumbly and dry, add a little more water (until it is the texture of Play-Doh). Roll it into a ball, wrap it in clingfilm and pop it in the fridge for 2-3 hours or, ideally, overnight. To make the tarts, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4, and grease six 10cm fluted tart tins. Roll the pastry out to a single thin layer then cut circles, roughly 11cm wide, and lay each round of pastry over a tin, pressing it down into the fluted edges. Run a rolling pin over the edges of the tin to remove the excess pastry. Prick the bottom of each pastry case several times with a fork, cover with squares of parchment paper and fill with baking beans (or rice) to hold the paper down, before putting them in the oven to blind-bake for 10-15 minutes – you want the pastry to become very lightly coloured. While the pastry is baking, make your filling. Roughly chop the onion and toss it in a pan with a little oil and a pinch of salt. Cook on a medium heat for five minutes or so, until very slightly softened. Roughly chop the asparagus (discarding the tougher part of the stalks) and toss it into the pan with the onion to cook for a further five minutes, then set to one side. Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork; then add the cream and grate in the pecorino cheese before mixing well together. Add a little salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the cooked asparagus and onion into the pastry cases, and pour over the egg mixture – you want the filling to come up to just below the edge of the pastry cases. Put the tarts back in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden on top. Leave to cool in their tins before taking them out.
