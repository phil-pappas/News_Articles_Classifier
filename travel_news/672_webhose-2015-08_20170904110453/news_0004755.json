It is a huge pile of prawns with mayonnaise and egg on a great piece of rye bread. It tastes of the sea and happiness. Accompanied by a local brewed beer, you have a bit of magic. Also, the views of the city at night cannot be beat.\ngothiatowers.com\nFrostback\nCanal tour The canals evoke a Scandinavian Amsterdam, softened by steamy cafes that could almost be in Vienna. Only when you tuck into wintry-white seafood, served by statuesque blondes, do you remember you’re in Sweden. Try a Paddan canal boat tour, which sweeps under 20 bridges, including Osthyvel, the “cheese-slicer” bridge, which is so low you have to lie flat to pass underneath it. In winter, rugs are provided, along with gingerbread biscuits and steaming glögg – hot mulled wine.\nstromma.se\nLisaGerardSharp\nRestaurant 2112 The city is well known for inventing the heavy metal genre of the Gothenburg Sound made famous by bands such as Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates and In Flames. Two members of the latter, Björn Gelotte and Peter Iwers, opened a high quality burger restaurant and bar called Restaurant 2112, named after the album by Canadian rock band Rush. If you want to mingle with Gothenburg’s rock elite, or just sample the fine foods and beers, this is the place to go.\nrestaurant2112.com\nChris Morris\nFree ferries Photograph: Sonja Irani If you get a one-day or three-day ticket for Gothenburg’s public transport, you can do a tour on the ferry for free. Hop on and hop off as many times as you like or just stay on the ferry all the way through. On a sunny day, it’s a summer must-do!\nvasttrafik.se\nSonja Irani\nMarstrand Photograph: PN An island north of Gothenburg, Marstrand is reached by bus or tour boats. The island has somewhat of a snobby reputation due to it being the centre of the sailing world in West Sweden, but it has good restaurants, cafes and boutique shops, and is a great place to walk or swim. Marstrand is also a must for discerning Abba fans, as the video for Winner Takes It All was filmed there.\nmarstrand.se\nDavid Perrin\nThe Feskekörka Feast at the Feskekörka Photograph: ideaswoman\nThe “Fish Church”. Well, you have to, really, don’t you, just for the name. But oh, the fishy delights inside, from vast salads to fish pies, to take out and eat contentedly at the picnic tables outside or across the canal in the park. If you’re feeling in need of a more formal lunch, there’s a restaurant upstairs.\nfeskekörka.se\nideaswoman\nBotaniska trädgården (Gothenburg Botanical Garden) With more than 170 hectares this is one of Europe’s largest gardens. The greenhouses have the largest collection of tropical orchids in Sweden, carnivorous plants and the rare Easter Island tree, which is extinct in its natural environment. A series of exhibitions are held in the greenhouses every year and the garden has a comprehensive schedule of activities all year round. The garden is close to the nature reserve Änggårdsbergen , where the scientific tree collection, the arboretum, is located. The Botanical Garden has two stars in the Michelin Green Guide and guided tours are arranged daily during the summer season.\ngotbot.se\nemeliestockhaus\nAskimsbadet beach Photograph: Neil McCartney To escape the hustle and bustle of the bars and clubs of Gothenburg, try a short journey south (less than an hour) to a beautiful beach at Askimsbadet, with its own official surf clubhouse as well.\ngoteborg.com\nneilmccartney\nBar Centro\n As a frequent visitor to Gothenburg I soon heard of the food and wine at Bar Centro, located on a quiet back street. Apparently it is the place where chefs go on their nights off (always a good sign in my book). The enthusiastic staff serve dishes of the kind which you could expect from an osteria in Trastevere and the assortment of natural wines is nothing short of remarkable. A true gem!\nbarcentro.se\nFourchette", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "http://xn--feskekrka-57a.se/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F17%2Fthe-best-of-gothenburg-sweden-readers-travel-tips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F14%2F1439551399164%2F183e6f57-7f20-437a-8863-eabcc1a249d9-1020x612.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F17%2Fthe-best-of-gothenburg-sweden-readers-travel-tips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F14%2F1439545993342%2F81faf580-5a1c-4d61-ab93-97f59b4bdc83-2060x1374.jpeg", "http://www.vasttrafik.se/", "http://www.marstrand.se/en/", "http://www.stromma.se/en/gothenburg/sightseeing/sightseeing-by-boat/the-paddan-tour/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fstw%23img-5", "http://www.goteborg.com/en/askimsbadet/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fstw%23img-3", "http://www.barcentro.se/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLd-P6lZMms", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F17%2Fthe-best-of-gothenburg-sweden-readers-travel-tips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F14%2F1439544867914%2F698a653e-d497-4772-b9b0-ce5434f9e9a5-2060x1545.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fsfb%23img-5&ref=responsive", "https://www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl#q=Botaniska+tr%C3%A4dg%C3%A5rden", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=The+best+of+Gothenburg%2C+Sweden%3A+readers%27+travel+tips&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Faug%2F17%2Fthe-best-of-gothenburg-sweden-readers-travel-tips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F8%2F14%2F1439552485248%2Fb353509a-d622-499f-808f-5e3320070b8d-2060x2060.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.gothiatowers.com/?lang=en", "http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/vastragotaland/Sv/djur-och-natur/skyddad-natur/naturreservat/lanets-naturreservat/goteborg/anggardsbergen/Pages/index.aspx", "http://restaurant2112.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4bgb8%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive"], "published": "2015-08-17T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:26:36.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
