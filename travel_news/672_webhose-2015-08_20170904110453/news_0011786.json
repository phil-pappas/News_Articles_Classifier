That’s the message of the Eden Project in Cornwall , Tim Smit’s visionary recreation of a rainforest in a worked-out Cornish china clay pit. Its world-famous geodesic domes - inflated panels of triangles, pentagons and hexagons made into 300ft domes - are filled with thousands of plants and trees recreating the environmental conditions of both a rainforest and the Mediterranean. \nThe 35-acre site is a shrine to ingenuity and the human imagination filled with sculptures, play areas, vegetable gardens, restaurants and even a zip wire, all with environmental conservation, education and sustainability as their core message. The result is the world’s most exotic, scent-filled, fun, interactive, imaginative and sheer mind-blowing classroom on the planet! Getting there \nHead for St Austell in the south of mid Cornwall and follow the Eden Project signs from the A30 where it meets the A391 at the Innis Downs junction. Satnav Postcode: PL24 2SG. There is extensive free parking with electric vehicle charging points. \nThe Eden Project's Biomes house the world's largest indoor rainforest (AP) Photo: Kevin Jarratt - Fotolia Top sights Rainforest and Mediterranean Biomes \nThe world-famous geodesic domes house both the world’s largest indoor rainforest and a Mediterranean microclimate. The former houses exotic plants from cocoa pods, coffee beans, bananas and rubber plants to the red powder puff flower and the gigantic titan arum, not to mention a waterfall, roul-roul partridges and Sulawesi white-eye birds. Top tip: Ticket discounts available for entry after 3.30pm on days in summer when open till 8pm. Richard Madden \nThe latter is a scent extravaganza dedicated to the warm temperate parts of the world with plants from the Med itself, South Africa and California complete with olive groves, vineyards, cacti, date palms and aromatic herbs, giant lemon-like fruits called citrons to gnarled old cork trees and huge sprouting aloe veras. Outdoor Garden \nWith more than 3,000 plant varieties, the meandering pathways are full of hidden features including a secret garden telling the myth and folklore of plants and a giant wooden ship set in a sea of tea leaves. The Core \nThe Eden Project’s inspirational education and exhibition space housed under an eye-catching spiral timber-roof. The Seed \nGigantic seed-shaped sculpture in The Core carved from a single piece of granite in the pattern of a Fibonacci spiral – the growth pattern at the heart of the natural world. Weee Man & The Bee \nA giant 23-ft high waste-monster constructed from thrown-out electrical and electronic equipment representing the amount (3.3 tons) the average British household throws away in a lifetime. The huge bee at the entrance to the biomes reminds us how much we depend on our friendly pollinators. Rites of Dionysus Sculpture \nTim Shaw’s sculptures depict the myth of Dionysus, Greek god of the vines, and his followers, the Maenads, who dance and writhe through the vines beating drums and sounding trumpets. \nThe gardens are filled with sculptures made from sustainable materials (AP) Things for children Sense of Play Garden & Spiral Garden \nA safe place for kids to let off steam, the former has tunnels and teepees made of willow around a sandpit, timber perches, a throne and musical instruments while the latter (a template for a low-cost school or community garden) has willow spirals, Venus flytraps, sweet scented marsh mallow and a squirting cucumber which bursts open and shoots its seeds over 25 feet! Rainforest Canopy Walkway \nTransports you into the hidden world of a rainforest canopy and explains why rainforests are vital to the survival of life on Planet Earth.
