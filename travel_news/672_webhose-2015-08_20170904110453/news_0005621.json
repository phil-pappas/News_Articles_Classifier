Thousands of runners fill the streets during the annual San Antonio Rock 'n' Roll… more The 2014 Rock ‘n’ Roll San Antonio Marathon pumped $26 million into the Alamo City economy, according to local organizers. But it’s unclear whether the California company that produces the marquee event will continue to provide its expertise — and branding — after December. San Diego-based Competitor Group Inc., which has produced the San Antonio marathon since 2008, is in the final year of a five-year contract extension with the City of San Antonio. San Antonio Sports is seeking proposals from firms interested in producing the Alamo city marathon, half marathon and related events in 2016 through 2020. Those proposals are due Oct. 1, according to Mary Ullmann Japhet , senior vice president of the nonprofit group. Japhet confirmed that the “Rock ‘n’ Roll Series” brand belongs to CGI. So if another firm lands the San Antonio contract, it will likely have to rebrand the Alamo City event. Japhet said CGI is expected to submit a proposal for the next contract, which will include an option for a two-year renewal that would run through 2022. San Antonio’s Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon now attracts some 20,000 participants annually. It also generates national and international media exposure, according to event promoters.

He added that San Antonio leaders want to extend the legacy of an event “that draws runners from all over the state, the country and the world.” The 2015 San Antonio marathon is scheduled for Dec. 5 and 6. \nWant San Antonio Sports Business   Courtesy of Ryan Bethke/Competitor Group Inc.
