No tourists were on the flight, according to local media reports. \n\nTrigana is a small airline company operating in remote parts of Indonesia. It has been on the EU’s list of banned carriers since 2007, along with other local carriers such as Lion Air. \n\nThe ban forbids those on the list from operating in European airspace due to safety and regulatory concerns. \n\nThis is the latest in a series of unfortunate air disasters to befall Indonesia, including an incident in December 2014 which saw an AirAsia jet carrying 162 passengers crash into the Java Sea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:37:12.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
