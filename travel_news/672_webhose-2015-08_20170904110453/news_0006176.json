Flight 3145, departed from Miami at 2:26pm EST according to FlightAware. Return flight 3146 arrived back in Miami from Havana’s Jose Marti International Airport at 5:05pm. There was very little hoopla or press presence at the airport upon boarding. Most people in the boarding area and check-in didn’t even notice anything special. Of most importance to Eastern and its new client, the first flight went out full and on-time. Onboard, the occasion was similarly downplayed with soft drinks and plantains being served on the 42 minute flights. The inaugural flights did conduct a special fly by and received a traditional water cannon salute.\nThe launch, originally scheduled for yesterday then pushed to Sunday, has been a moving target due to undisclosed reasons but sources cited finishing paperwork up with the Cuban authorities and TSA as reasons for the slight delay.\nEastern will operate 2 flights to Havana and 1 to Camaguey tomorrow. Moving forward, Havana will be served twice daily with Santa Clara and Camaguey receiving weekly service. The previously announced Veteran’s Honor Flight will operate Saturday MIA-DCA-MIA. The Miami Herald reports that Eastern has secured another charter agreement with “a major airline” to provide lift between the New York and undisclosed destinations in the Caribbean upon arrival of its 2nd 737-800 next month. Scheduled service is due to commence within “12 months” according to Ed Wegel the airline’s CEO.\nThe airline still looms very large in Miami. The South Florida city was the headquarters for the original Eastern from 1975 until the 1991 shutdown, and at one time was the largest private employer in Miami-Dade County. Miami was Eastern’s 2nd largest hub, and the center of its famed Latin American operations, behind Atlanta. Despite the very low key soft launch’ after 24 years, 4 months, and 8 days, the iconic “Wings of Man” returned to the skies.\nSource:- Eastern Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T10:16:58.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
