With our people in places like Manila , we will do cross-selling and cater to South-east Asian markets. Europe and US markets remain too far away.\" \n\nCredit: Studio City Macau \n\nAccording to Grant Johnson, Melco Crown Entertainment’s vice president of sales and marketing, China remains a priority market driven by its emerging middle class, even as the group's penetration in mainland China is very low and remains concentrated in the Guangdong area. \n\nThe IR is currently staging road shows in Shanghai and Beijing and will organise another one in Guangzhou early next month. “We’ll work with our partners, promoting in high traffic areas and selling packages. So far, three local Guangdong and South China (agencies), namely Nanhu, GZL and CITS, have confirmed their participation,” said Johnson. \n\n“We also target Hong Kong, Taiwan and secondary markets like Japan and (South) Korea. Since most of our hotel rooms in City Of Dreams are filled by gaming patrons, we now have 1,600 new rooms which allow us to grow in different segments,” he added. \n\nStudio City Hotel’s Celebrity Tower caters for wholesale and entry-level gaming clientele whereas the Star Tower is positioned as a high-end accommodation differentiated by quality amenities as well as perks such as ferris wheel rides and access to indoor and outdoor pools. Twin rooms make up about 45 per cent of the 1,600 rooms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:03:27.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
