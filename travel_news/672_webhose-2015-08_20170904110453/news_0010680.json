With the publication of Moving Minds, its fifth biennial Corporate Responsibility (CR) Report, the company has showcased its achievements as a responsible corporate citizen in the years 2013 and 2014.\nThe CR Report reflects how the company is providing integrated and sustainable mobility solutions that meet the need for people to connect – in cities, regions, and countries worldwide. It shows how CR is embedded in the company’s business model throughout its operations, global supply chain, and product development. The report also provides examples of how Bombardier Transportation has established long-term partnerships with its stakeholders to build communities and improve the quality of life of people worldwide.\nA structured stakeholder analysis is an important element to shape Bombardier Transportation’s CR agenda. This stakeholder approach is also reflected in the CR Report 2014 as it is structured around Bombardier’s customers, suppliers, public authorities, employees, communities as well as shareholders, investors and analysts, providing them with a more comprehensive view of Bombardier Transportation’s business conduct.\nBombardier Transportation’s commitment to supporting communities is embedded in its strategy of growing local roots in key markets. The business continued to increase the focus of its sponsorships and donations globally on the three areas of education, environment and entrepreneurship. In 2014, 58% of its donations and sponsorships were allocated to these three areas, up from 35% in 2011 and 46% in 2012. This targeted approach helps Bombardier Transportation to create value in the communities where it operates. Successful employee volunteering events in different regions gathered best practice, paving the way towards more volunteering activities in the future.\nSource:- Bombardier Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:14:13.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
