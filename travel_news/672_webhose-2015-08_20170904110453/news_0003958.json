Currently, tourism employs 700,000 people.\nThe nation is expected to finish most of the work to achieve its vision of becoming one of the top five tourist destination countries in Africa during the next five years, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:39:23.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
