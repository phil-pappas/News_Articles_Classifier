(Photo by Rich Fury/Invision/AP) The TV academy and the SAG-AFTRA actors union held its third annual pre-Emmy diversity reception Thursday at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. With little on the agenda other than to celebrate, stars including Daniel Dae Kim, Garcelle Beauvais and \"American Crime\" supporting actor nominee Richard Cabral ate, drank and mingled under the stars on the warm, breezeless night.\nIn a year when the Academy Awards were criticized for an all-white slate of acting nominees, TV actors are toasting the opportunities on the small screen for women, people of color and people with disabilities.\nDiverse casting could even make history on Emmy night: If either Taraji P. Henson of \"Empire\" or Viola Davis of \"How to Get Away With Murder\" win for lead dramatic actress, she will be the first black woman to do so in that category.\nLamorne Morris arrives at the 2015 Dynamic and Diverse Emmy Celebration at the Montage Hotel on Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Photo by Rich Fury/Invision/AP) George said \"the 'Empire' effect\" and \"the Shonda Rhimes effect\" have inspired agents and studios to intentionally seek actors \"from the diversity categories\" for lead roles.\nKim and Beauvais said Hollywood has to embrace diversity because viewers are demanding to see people who look like themselves on TV.\n\"We've got a long way to go yet, but there are strides made every year, whether it's for race or gender or sexual orientation,\" Kim said. \"I think television, especially, is leading the way in being more progressive.\"\nAubrey Anderson-Emmons arrives at the 2015 Dynamic and Diverse Emmy Celebration at the Montage Hotel on Thursday, Aug. 27, 2015, in Beverly Hills, Calif.
