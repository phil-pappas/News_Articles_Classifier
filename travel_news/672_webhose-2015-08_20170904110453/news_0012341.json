Our aim is to ensure that 2015 is the best year ever for Irish tourism and this is good news indeed, with the increase in visitor numbers from overseas helping to boost economic recovery around the country.\n“I am delighted to see that growth has been recorded from all of our markets around the world, with record numbers arriving here from North America (up almost +15% on the first seven months of 2014). Ireland now welcomes 10% of all American visitors to Europe – particularly noteworthy given the intense competition from other destinations. Mainland Europe has also turned in another stellar performance (up almost +13%), with important markets like Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the Nordic region and Benelux all recording really good growth. I also welcome the strong increase in British visitors (+11%), our largest market for overseas tourism, and from our long-haul markets like Australia, China and India (+8.5%).”\nNiall Gibbons continued: “This was a strong performance and reflects the sentiment we are hearing from our tourism industry partners overseas, including tour operators and carriers, as well as tourism businesses here at home. We are determined to ensure that tourism growth continues. We will shortly launch our extensive autumn campaign – aimed at boosting late-season travel to Ireland from around the globe and keeping this momentum going. The period September to December traditionally yields as much as 30% of our annual overseas tourism business.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:08:46.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
