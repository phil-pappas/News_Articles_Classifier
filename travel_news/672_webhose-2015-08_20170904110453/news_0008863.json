While some brief relief is possible in France and Germany, extreme heat will hold from Spain to Italy and Poland for much of the week ahead. \nThe setup for this round of heat is a slow-moving storm to the west of the British Isles and high pressure over eastern Europe which will combine to promote a strong southwest flow from northern Africa and Spain into northern and central Europe. \nThe heat began to build from Spain to Germany on Sunday before surging to some of the highest levels of the summer on Monday. \nTemperatures soared past 32 C (90 F) for the seventh time this summer in Paris on Monday while temperatures flirted with the 32 C (90 F) mark in Brussels. Highs in the lower 20s C (lower to middle 70s F) are more common this time of year. \nA cold front will bring cooler air along with showers and thunderstorms to areas from France into Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany on Tuesday. \nThe high temperature is only expected to climb to 24 C (75 F) in Paris on Tuesday while Brussels will be a cool 22 C (71 F). \nBerlin and Warsaw also saw temperatures reach or surpass 32 C (90 F) on Monday with more heat on the way for Tuesday. \nThe cold front will reach Berlin by the end of the day on Tuesday, bringing a shower or thunderstorm during the evening followed by a much cooler day on Wednesday. \nThis front will weaken and never reach Warsaw, keeping the heat in place right into this weekend. \nResidents are reminded to drink plenty of water and never to leave kids or pets unattended in a sealed car. Strenuous activities should be avoided during the midday and afternoon hours, the hottest times of the day. If that is not possible, be sure to take frequent breaks. \n\"There is concern for some of the thunderstorms to be strong,\" stated AccuWeather Meteorologist Tyler Roys. \"That is especially true in northern Germany and Denmark later Tuesday.\" \nThe front will also not be able to sweep the heat away from Madrid, setting the stage for another round of heat spreading into France and Germany during the second half of the week. Highs in Paris will once again climb into the lower 30s C (near 90 F) by Thursday. \nThis second surge of heat would also build across southern and southeast Europe during the second half of the week, impacting areas such a Milan, Florence, Budapest and Prague. \nSome locations such as Prague, Berlin and Warsaw will approach monthly and all-time record highs during the second half of this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T02:44:48.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
