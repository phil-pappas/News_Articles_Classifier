From revolutionaries and Hollywood stars to even great authors — everyone worth one’s salt has donned it. There are a range of beard styles to don: the perfect stubble, the scruffy hipster look and the untamed revolutionary look. \nIndeed, if you want instant likes and followers on your social network uploads, this is one style you need to adopt. Grow and groom a beard and style it right so you can safeguard yourself from the boring clean shaven look. \n“Grooming your beard is the most important thing. One must invest in a beard trimmer, beard wax and beard comb. It’s an accessory in itself so style it right,” says Mohit Rai, a fashion stylist. \nTalking about the right look for a day of fun and one at work, Rai says, “For a day out with friends add uber chic sunglasses to your look and you’ll be sorted. At work, one needs to go for the ultra-sleek look.” The other handy tip, say experts, “never dye your beard.” \nSo, now that you know the trick of getting that bearded look right, go straight ahead and say goodbye to your old look.
