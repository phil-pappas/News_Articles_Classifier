The more you use it, the more concrete information you get. ICCA members— together with the ICCA team — are working hard to achieve a mutually beneficial ocean of information on the ICCA Association Database. The red update button is your key! Keep finding ways to press it and you’ll be up in the running towards becoming the next Researcher of the Month! This month, it is Patricia Marafigo of Iguassu Convention & Visitors Bureau, who made it to the August 2015’s Researcher of the Month! Why do you consider it so important to contribute your meeting information to ICCA Data? The more information we have about a process, the easier our work becomes.\nI think it is important to contribute whenever it is possible, the same way we wish information to be complete when we look for it on the ICCA database. Sometimes you may even find out that an event you are looking for may also be looking for you. What would you like to say to other ICCA members who haven’t actively used the ICCA Database? The ICCA Database is a powerful tool and it’s up to you to explore it and take advantage of it. Familiarise yourself with the website, exchange information, and find many other benefits for you as a professional and for your organisation.\nSource:-ICCA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T05:26:19.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
