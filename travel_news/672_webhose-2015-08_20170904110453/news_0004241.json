Since then, Qantas and Network Aviation have grown the fleet to 14 F100 aircraft.\nIn 2014, Qantas announced that Network Aviation would start Regular Passenger Transport (RPT) services on regional routes in Western Australia.\nNetwork Aviation employs more than 340 people.\nSource: Qantas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T17:40:50.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
