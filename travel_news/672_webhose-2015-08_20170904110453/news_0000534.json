The newest addition to the destination’s evolving food and beverage scene welcomes guests as an innovative cocktail bar, restaurant and lounge located in Four Seasons Resort and Residences Vail. The Remedy offers a vibrant and chic, yet casual atmosphere coupled with live music, a locally-inspired culinary menu and provocative bar program. Serving up innovative potions and spirited concoctions, with a twist on classic cocktails, The Remedy is designed “to cure what ails” its patrons and promises a new sense of place and lively gathering spot for locals and travellers alike.\nThe Remedy’s original beverage program features an expansive list of reimagined cocktails with a new take on vintage cures and tonics including an Après Whiskey Cart, deemed the “Doctor of Drinks,” that provides a first-of-its-kind tableside cocktail service in Vail. Inventive elixirs include The Corpse Revival Bloody Mary, The Medicine Cabinet gin cocktail, and other “remedies” such as the Hair of the Dog vodka concoction. In addition, The Remedy offers a selection of rotating taps featuring limited edition Colorado craft beer and signature cocktails as well as an extensive wine list.\nUnder the direction of Executive Chef Kevin Erving, The Remedy features a seasonally significant menu showcasing its Colorado roots, with an imaginative array of artisanal flatbreads, creative small bites and shareable dishes. The playful menu highlights locally foraged produce, Colorado meats and cheeses with clever names such as Kevin’s Bacon Pizza with brie and smoked bacon, Doctor’s Orders with smoked chicken liver pate, and various “Antidotes” such as Wing Therapy or Grilled Cheese on Shrooms. A Sunday After-Market offering invites local farmer’s market vendors into The Remedy to sell and discuss their products, which are then highlighted on the menu as the weekly Chef’s Bite.\nIn addition to “Your Daily Prescription” (aka Happy Hour) from 5:00 to 6:00 pm, The Remedy also features “seven ways to remedy your week” – nightly specials to nurse guests back to health after a long day. Weekly themes include Double Dose Tuesdays with a two-for-one deal on draft pints and pork belly sliders and the Mid-Week Remedy on Wednesdays offering live music and weekly contests inviting patrons to share their own favourite remedies. The bar also features multiple dining and lounging areas throughout, including an expansive outdoor patio with custom fire pits and a 165-inch TV wall in the west side lounge for prime sports viewing.\n“We couldn’t be more excited to finally debut The Remedy to locals and visitors of Vail,” says Mark Herron, General Manager of Four Seasons Resort and Residences Vail. “The innovative menu and cocktail program showcasing daily happy hours and themed specials is sure to make The Remedy the must-visit bar in Vail.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:58:30.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
