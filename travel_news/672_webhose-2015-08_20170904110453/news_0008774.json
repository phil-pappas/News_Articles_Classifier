Grille Group this would not have been possible.\nWe are all tremendously excited to give travelers from all over a fun and inviting place to come together and celebrate sports and great food.” Eddie George, a nine – season NFL star running back for the Tennessee Titans and 1995 Heisman Trophy winner at The Ohio State University, has ventured beyond his athlete persona finding wild success as a restaurateur. George opened his first restaurant in Nashville followed by a second located in the heart of The Ohio State University campus. The Eddie George’s Grille 27 experience that so many have raved about is now available for travelers in the heart of Concourse BinPort Columbus International Airport. Located next to the airport’s recently modernized gates B19 and B21, the restaurant offers full table service, a full bar,a grab – and – go counter, and a panoramic view of the new south runway. The state of the art high – definition televisions make you feel like you’re on the sidelines at Ohio Stadium.\n“Port Columbus is privileged to be the first airport to offer Eddie George’s Grille 27 and we appreciate partnering with HMSHost and the G.R.E.A.T. Grille Group to provide another local restaurant option for our passengers,” said Elaine Roberts, President & CEO, Columbus Regional Airport Authority. “With a panoramic airfield view, an appealing men\nu, and a sports lounge atmosphere, customers can expect an exceptional dining experience indicative of the restaurant’s dynamic namesake.”\nTravelers find a relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of an airport while at Eddie George’s Grille 27 where they can also catch a taste of the Ohio State football experience. It fits right in with Port Columbus and HMSHost’s dining vision to bring more local flavors into the airport and allow travelers from across the country to savor good food and enjoy a common love of sports.\nAside from the best sports viewing you could imagine in between flights, Eddie’s versatile menu offers a lot more than the archetypal everyday bar food, providing a dynamic selection ranging from mouthwatering breakfast options to gourmet appetizers to upscale spins on sports bar favorites to hand – crafted entrees.\nIf you prefer a lighter meal you can choose from a variety of fresh salads such as the Balsamic Roasted Beet Salad with fire roasted beets, goat cheese, and toasted almonds tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. For something filling and satisfying, you can opt for the Grilled BBQ Burri to stuffed with grilled chicken.\nEddie has even got you covered if you want to go for something more fresh\nand sophisticated.
