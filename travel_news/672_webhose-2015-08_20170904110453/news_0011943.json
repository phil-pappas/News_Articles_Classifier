The first one, which started from Pa Kia and ended at Ban Sop Kai, was featured in this column last Thursday. (In case you missed it and would like to know about it, visit goo.gl/X2pJ80.) \nToday I'll tell you about the other route, which I did with a friend and the staff of Trailhead, a new bike tour company based in Chiang Mai, on our second day there. \nLike the previous morning, after breakfast we set off from the resort near the town of Chiang Dao where we had spent the night and took a ride on Trailhead's SUV up the mountain road to Pa Kia ridge. This time instead of dropping us and the bikes at the three-way junction as on the first day, the driver took us a bit further south, passing a watershed management unit to Pa Kia Highland Research and Training Centre. \nThis was the second time this year I had been at the centre, which is run by Chiang Mai University's Faculty of Agriculture. It sits on a nice location from where you can normally enjoy a breathtaking view of Doi Luang Chiang Dao, the Kingdom's tallest limestone mountain. However, in the rainy season like this, the iconic jagged-top Doi Luang could be obscured by thick fog, which was the case that morning. \nBut that was not all bad news. The mist and the groves of pine trees flanking the dirt mountain track were a beautiful mix, so much so that even the climbs were pleasurable. \nAfter a while, however, I spotted something on the ground that reminded me not to be overwhelmed by the dreamy atmosphere. Coiling just a few metres from my front wheel was a snake. I had no idea what species it was. All I knew was that it was a young one. The fact that it stayed in a defensive pose and refused to budge even when a rock was rolled next to it was a warning sign that we shouldn't mess with it. Unlike non-poisonous species, snakes that are confident of their deadly fangs don't usually flee when you approach them. Besides, snake venom is always dangerous, regardless of the size of the creature that bites you. \nAfter taking some photos, we left it alone and continued with our ride, paying as much attention to the trail as to the scenery. \nWe stopped to have our packed lunch at a tea plantation along a single track. Soon after we resumed, the trail started to go downward. It's a long, winding, yet fast-flowing descent that took us all the way to the foothills in a short time. To me, this was the best part of the trail. It was such great fun that none of us bothered to stop to take photos of the section which ended at a road that led us to a Buddhist temple in Ban Mae Taman where the SUV was waiting. \nPlease accept my apology for not having a single picture of that downhill part for you to see. If you want to know what it's really like, you have to go there and find out for yourself. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
