He entered the industry upon completing his Master's degree in development economics at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the UK, and left Explore Worldwide after serving as its Bangkok-based Overseas Operations Manager for South East Asia from 2001 to 2004. In his past two positions Mr Dupont was Director of Sales on a consulting basis for the launch of Ani Villas' Thailand and Sri Lanka luxury projects, while he was Chief Operating Officer for Pandaw Cruises, an operator of river cruises in Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos. \"We're delighted to have Anthony on our team,\" said Indigo Pearl General Manager Christopher Oakes. \"He's proven time and again over many years that he is an exceptional leader who conceives and implements strategies that drive business.\" Prior to his stint at Ani Villas, Mr Dupont was Director of Sales and Marketing at The Sarojin, a five-star resort on Khao Lak, Thailand, Global and Regional Sales Manager for Aman Resorts and Director of Sales and Marketing for Bangkok-based destination management company ICS Travel Group, where he focused on the luxury segment. Mr Dupont, who holds Bachelor degrees with honours in economics and French from the University of Sussex in the UK, was General Manager of Colombo-based Lanka Travel World. In 2004 he established his own destination management company, Bangkok-based Essential Travel, with it still operating today as a small-group adventure holiday facilitator for the UK market. Indigo Pearl is a unique resort located at a stunning, serene setting that its tropical modern design maestro Bill Bensley described as Phuket's 'heart and soul'. Bensley's design was inspired by the tin mines of Phuket's heritage, and created between the lush greens and shaded groves of Phuket's only national park, as well as the azure waters of Nai Yang Beach. Located near the airport and many of Phuket's finest beaches, Indigo Pearl is a world of its own.
