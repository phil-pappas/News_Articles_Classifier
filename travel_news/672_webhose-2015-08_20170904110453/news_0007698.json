Between August 5 and 21, 2016 , some 10,500 athletes from 205 nations will arrive to compete; the Paralympic tournament will run from September 7-18. Hundreds of thousands of people will travel to Rio to offer their support. The party will stretch from the Maracana stadium in the city centre, which will stage the opening and closing ceremonies, to Copacabana, where beach volleyball, road cycling and rowing contests will take place, to the southern suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where many new venues have been built. Rio's legendary Maracana stadium Photo: GETTY Where World Cup travellers had to consider the complexities of multi-venue itineraries and the high likelihood of England being knocked out at an early stage, the Olympics unfolds in one city. Rio, Brazil’s former capital, has been gearing up since the games were awarded to it in 2009 – with new roads, bike paths, pavements and utilities being built, new light rail and bus transit systems and a massive new waterfront development called Porto Maravilha. In the Carnival-loving city, it is expected that the Games will provide an opportunity for lots of extra-sporting activities and beach fun. Construction of a massive new waterfront development called Porto Maravilha is underway Photo: GETTY Flights TAM and British Airways operate non-stop flights from London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro’s Galeao international airport. Flights take approx. 11 hrs 30 mins and London-Rio return flights out of season start at £429 with TAM. During the Games, expect to pay at least double this price. Air France, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa and other airlines fly non-stop from European airports to Rio. TAP flies from Lisbon to several Brazilian cities, including Fortaleza, Recife and Brasilia. Flight information for August 2016 is not currently available but check a flight comparison website, such as Opodo, for prices shortly. Edward Paine of Latin American specialist tour firm Last Frontiers, said: “Finding flights shouldn’t be too much of a problem as long as people are willing to fly lateral – that is, enter Brazil via routes that don’t go directly to Rio.” Consider flying via another city, such as Brasilia Photo: AP/FOTOLIA How to book Tickets for the Games, which start at around £8, can be purchased at the official site: rio2016.com/en/take-part/tickets .

Rio de Janeiro Where to go Visitors to the Games who want to see more than Rio and environs have plenty of options . South of the city is the Costa Verde, a swathe of forest-fringed beaches that runs all the way to Santos and the sprawl of São Paulo. Colonial Paraty, funky Ilhabela and car-free Ilha Grande are small and beautiful alternatives with stunning coastlines and first-rate hotels and gastronomy. North of Rio are the beach resorts of Buzios and Cabo Frio – the former is almost as glitzy as it was in the 1960s, when Bardot “discovered” it, while the latter is more popular with middle-class cariocas (as Rio residents are known).

Travel companies such as Journey Latin America and Bespoke Brazil are offering a range of itineraries to the Pantanal wetlands, Amazon and north coast, some incorporating Rio – others avoiding it completely. • Rio's best beaches • Rio's best restaurants • The best free things to do in Rio Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:31:11.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
