It’s not the pre-holiday diet or monthly facial that keep you looking – and feeling – your best, it’s the little everyday things that contribute to ultimate health and happiness. Bathroom design expert Geberit is a keen ambassador of this philosophy. Since 1879, Geberit has been creating innovative bathroom solutions, adopting the holistic view – so crucial to well-being – of everything in perfect balance. Bringing together design, function and innovation is its new and highly anticipated AquaClean Mera shower toilet. Building on the brand’s AquaClean technology, which uses an in-built shower nozzle enabling users to wash with fresh water after every use, the Mera shower toilet combines the cleaning and hygiene capabilities of a bidet with the comfort and style of a sophisticated lavatory. Additional features include a discreet night light, an automatic lid, a seat-heating system, an odour-extraction system, a dryer and a remote control This is the first toilet to feature patented WhirlSpray shower technology in conjunction with a hybrid warm-water system, resulting in an immediate supply of warm water, delivered via a revitalising shower spray, ensuring a thorough and gentle clean. Known for its attention to detail, Geberit has ensured that even the conventional aspects of design have been rethought, with TurboFlush technology combined with a unique rimless pan, resulting in the most thorough – and quiet – flush possible. Additional features include a discreet night light, an automatic lid, a seat-heating system, an odour-extraction system, a dryer and a remote control that can be programmed for personal preferences – from water temperature to spray intensity. This cutting-edge technology is contained within a sleek WC, available in a white or chrome-plated finish. It all goes to prove that ultimate well-being does begin at home. • Visit the Geberit Facebook or Twitter page for more information on AquaClean products", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T21:43:35.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
