They had to rely on backup generators to keep the lights on. \nDechathorn Chan-ob, the Tambon Koh Kut Administration Organisation chief, welcomed the additional wattage, telling the FM91 police radio station that the era of a blackouts would come to an end. The underwater cable will draw more investment to the two islands, he added. \nThe cable connects the two islands with the national grid on the mainland in Khlong Yai district. It was built with the 1.4-billion-baht state budget approved by the government in 2012. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
