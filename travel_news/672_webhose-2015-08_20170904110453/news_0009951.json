The number of Chinese tourists plunged 27.1% for the first quarter of 2015, compared to the same period last year. Obviously, Malaysia’s loss is other countries’ gain.”\n“Why are some quarters paranoid about social ills when countries around the world welcome Chinese visitors with open arms? China tourists are the world’s biggest spenders and they are known to empty the shelves of luxury stores in London, Paris, Rome and New York. Last year, 2.2 million China tourists spent a staggering RM86 billion in the United States, or a whopping RM40, 000 per visitor!”“Anyone who is overly concerned on social ills should first scrutinize the elephant in the room, and that is the millions of undocumented workers in the country. In contrast, only 1,493 Chinese tourists were found to have overstayed last year and 612 were involved in immoral activities.\nIt is a miniscule figure against the 1,613,355 that visited Malaysia in 2014.”“Over 3,000 travel and tour companies are MATTA members with 96% licensed for inbound.Also, 50% of MATTA members have Bumiputras as the major shareholders. They put in an honest day’s work in this highly competitive business. It is easy for those not in the travel business to call for more creativity in tourism packages to boost arrivals.”\nSource:- Tourism Matta", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:12:38.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
