(AP) -- Dollywood has announced a new $22 million ride that the theme park says will be the world's fastest wooden roller coaster. The eastern Tennessee park says the Lightning Rod, themed after a 1950s-era hot rod, should be ready for visitors in March 2016. The Lighting Rod will launch riders up 20 stories from a standstill to 45 mph and riders will get 20 seconds of airtime along the 3,800-foot track. The park says the coaster will hit a top speed of 73 mph on a 165-foot drop. The $22 million price tag marks the largest single investment in the Dollywood Co.'s history.
