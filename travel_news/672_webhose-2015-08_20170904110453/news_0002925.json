The show is the first of its kind to recognise marketing works in three key areas – loyalty, engagement and relationship marketing, focusing solely on the art of cultivating customer loyalty and engagement. The award categories covered the full spectrum of the loyalty and engagement cycle. More than 80 client organisations were shortlisted across 26 categories, and entries were evaluated and judged by a panel of experienced loyalty, engagement and relationship marketers and industry experts.\nEnrich submitted two entry categories at the Awards; ‘Best Partnership in a Loyalty Programme’ and ‘Best Use of Relationship Marketing-B2C’.\nAccording to Malaysia Airlines’ Head of Enrich Loyalty Programme, Khairul Nisa Ismail, “This is a true recognition for Enrich, to have won this award under the partnership category. ‘Enrich Hearts Australia’ was our first branded redemption campaign with Tourism Australia, focusing just on Australia, to reward our members with the best redemption discount.”\n“We would like to thank Tourism Australia for all their support for driving the success of this campaign. This collaboration truly showcased the partnership of Malaysia Airline’s Frequent Flyer Program with a Tourism Board that Enrich is planning to further expand”, added Nisa.\nMichael Newcombe, Tourism Australia’s Regional General Manager for South/Southeast Asia & The Gulf said, “Australia is proud to be the destination of choice for Enrich’s award winning destination-focused redemption campaign. This was our first collaboration with an airline frequent flyer programme and it gave us the opportunity to showcase Australia to a discerning audience with a great appetite for travel. This successful campaign played a part in making Malaysia the 6th largest market for visitors to Australia, moving up from 7th place, as of June 2015.”\nIn January 2015, Enrich collaborated with Tourism Australia to introduce its first redemption campaign of the year focusing on Australian market called ‘Enrich Hearts Australia’. Through this campaign, Enrich members could redeem up to 50% off normal redemption points to their favourite destinations in Australia.\nTo celebrate this win, Enrich will be giving away 40% off on Enrich Miles to Australia! Members can redeem their Enrich Miles beginning 15 August to 31 August 2015 and travel from 15 August to 19 November 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T13:02:22.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
