If so, your new best friend is probably a chap called Fitbit. This friend is with you 24/7, knows what you consume on a daily basis, reports on how many steps you have taken and the number of hours of sleep you have clocked. In fact, beyond just tracking, he has a network of friends (in the form of apps) who can take external forces into consideration and recommend alternatives to better your lifestyle. We are now in the new age of wellness – Forbes reported that the body is the new couture ensemble – and you’re either on the fitness treadmill or off it. \nAlbert Pozo, President Amadeus Asia Pacific \n\nJust like fitness, we are in a new age of travel: the Age of Traveller Power where more people are travelling than ever before, travelling further with more specific reasons and with new channels to express their aspirations. With a smart device in nearly every hand, the traveller is well-informed and demands better service throughout the entire travel lifecycle. \n\nWouldn’t it be great if there was a tracker that allowed the traveller to take their pulse in terms of travel needs and understand how external and internal forces are affecting their well-being, as well as what informs, motivates and inspires them? \n\nUnderstanding the vital statistics \n\nIn fact, Amadeus is doing just that by investing in data and research to better understand and track travellers’ diverse and morphing needs. Data can be incredibly useful, but misleading if interpreted inaccurately. It’s important not only to understand demographic and geographic information, but also the psychographic nuances that influence travel decisions and behaviours. \n\nIn our Travel Lounge video series, we spoke to travellers in the Asia Pacific region and filmed their unscripted and uncensored thoughts on travel. What we found was unique and personalised perspectives on use of technology, business travel, ease of planning trips, how travel can make the world a better place and the overall transformation of the industry. \n\n\nOn a more macro scale, the Amadeus “ Future Traveller Tribes 2030 ” paper identifies the different ‘tribes’ or traveller segments that will shape the future of travel through to the end of the next decade. This explores how and why people travel from a behavioural perspective. A “Social Capital Seeker” for example would capture every step of their travel on Instagram. They will have very different habits and consumption patterns compared to an “Obligation Meeter”, who is looking for the best and most efficient travel agenda. Much like the tracking of your daily activities, diet and sleep, both the Travel Lounge video series and Traveller Tribes paper track the behaviours of the traveller in Asia Pacific. \n\nA personal health guru \n\nTracking data is but one step of the overall fitness regime. More often than not, most people will engage the wider ecosystem, for example by engaging their own personal trainer or nutritionist to help them understand and navigate their fitness data; to motivate and inspire them. This is much like the travel ecosystem – airlines, travel agents, rail providers, hotels and airports – that supports the traveller at every step of the journey. \n\nThe fight to be the fittest is not a sprint but a marathon. Having a coach that understands the nuances of how your body ticks, and making tailored recommendations based on your needs, is vital. Likewise, travel agents and travellers need a trusted partner that truly understands the travel landscape in Asia to stay ahead of the competition. \n\nFrom our leadership position sitting across the entire travel ecosystem in Asia Pacific, Amadeus continues to drive the industry forward by working with customers and partners to deliver technology that creates an increasingly personalised, connected and sustainable travel experience. Amadeus recently launched its Customer Experience Management system to move the industry even closer to the coveted end-to-end travel experience. With more than 30 of Asia Pacific’s leading airlines powered by Amadeus Altéa, we are perfectly positioned to help carriers move deeper into the travel experience space. \n\nWe are invested in the long term health of the ecosystem and the traveller. We are all pumped up for a workout. Are you? \n\nTo learn more about Future Traveller Tribes 2030 – and to find out which Tribe you belong to - visit amadeus.com/tribes2030 .
