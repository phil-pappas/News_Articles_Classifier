Aircraft are protected from lightning strikes because they're essentially Faraday cages, which means they both block and redistribute external electric fields. As Popular Science explains:\nRead More Old airports, congestion add to flier frustration\nBecause aluminum hull of an aircraft is highly conductive, an electrically charged storm cloud will tend to induce a charge separation on the outer surface of any airplane in the vicinity. This creates a difference in potential—a.k.a. voltage—between the cloud and the plane, resulting in a discharge of electric current between them. Since there is also a potential difference between the airplane and the tarmac, the lightning discharges right through the airplane and into the ground.\nRoad Warrior Voices has reached out to Delta for comment.
