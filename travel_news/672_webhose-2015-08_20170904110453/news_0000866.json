As compiled by FlightView, an airline and airport data provider, the July on-time arrival figures are in. And one thing most definitely hasn't changed from the June results — Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) is still on top of the heap among the four major domestic carriers with 80.9 percent of its flights arriving on time last month. That's an improvement for Delta over its June result, when the carrier notched 78.8 percent of flights arriving on time — also good enough to put the carrier in first place. An on-time arrival is defined as a flight that arrives within 14 minutes of its scheduled arrival time. But in July, American also surged to an even better No. 2 finish, ending the month with 76.6 percent of its flights arriving on time. That American result is up impressively from a 71.9 percent showing in June, when it became No. 2 ahead of Southwest in the on-time arrivals race by the thinnest of margins. 0.1 percent. Southwest Airlines , which began offering an expanded summer flight schedule in June, now looks to be paying the price for that decision, even if it may be bringing in more revenue. Southwest finished July with 73.1 percent of flights arriving on time. That 73.1 percent result exactly matched the July number for United Airlines (NYSE: UAL), which at least managed to improve over its abysmal 66.5 percent on-time performance in June. Southwest also did improve just a bit in July from its June on-time arrival result, which was 71.8 percent. July was a tumultuous labor month at Southwest. The carrier's more than 13,500 flight attendants spent July mulling and then voting on a tentative new contract. But the tentative contract was ultimately rejected by a whopping 87 percent of flight attendants who voted on it. Meanwhile, Parker is in the final weeks of fully merging U.S. Airways with American, a project that is expected to be completed by October. If Parker and his airline continue with the on-time arrival momentum they are now showing, American, the world's largest airline, could give Delta real reason to worry about its ability to remain atop the pack. As for Southwest, it remains to be seen if the carrier now has simply put too many flights into its schedule to remain a competitive on-time arrival performer. \nWant Dallas Travel   Bizspace Spotlight", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:01:29.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
