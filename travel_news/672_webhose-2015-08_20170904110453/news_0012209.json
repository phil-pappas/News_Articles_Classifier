Travelers to downtown Bothell, Woodinville or Monroe will leave I-405 two miles earlier than before, instead of weaving downhill in mainline traffic. The state built similar ramps from downtown Bellevue to Highway 520 three years ago.\nThe pinch lasts from 11 p.m. Friday until 5 a.m. Monday. It will disrupt travel from Eastside suburbs to the Evergreen State Fair in Monroe.\nMost Read Stories Mariners fire general manager Jack Zduriencik Now comes the hard part for the Mariners: Hiring Jack Zduriencik’s replacement Mariners demote struggling catcher Mike Zunino Why Russell Wilson needs to water down his Recovery claims Animated map: How the wildfires in North Central Washington have grown over time The I-405 northbound exits to 160th and Highway 522 will be closed, and drivers won’t be able to enter I-405 northbound from 160th.\nDetour options include Highway 522 through Kenmore, around the north end of Lake Washington.\nMeanwhile, crews will install equipment and paint lane stripes in Kirkland for new I-405 Express Toll Lanes, to open Sept. 27. These allow solo drivers to pay a toll , projected at $4 in heavy commute traffic, to travel 45 mph between Lynnwood and Bellevue.\nCarpools of at least three people at peak times, and two people off-peak, can enter these lanes for free using a newer-model Good2Go Flex Pass, which switches between carpool and solo mode.\nThe Washington State Department of Transportation wanted motorists to get accustomed to the new Bothell ramps, expected to carry 30,000 vehicles daily, a few weeks before the complicated toll startup.\nRelated: Several I-5 exits in Tacoma to close over weekend for construction\nMike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com .
