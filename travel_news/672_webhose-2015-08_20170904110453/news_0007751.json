This part of the Costa Brava, not far from Catalonia’s border with France, is a protected national park, unspoilt by the rampant development that has blighted other parts of the Spanish coast. The area is popular with hikers and naturalists, as well as those who love the sea, good wine and seafood. The swimming pool offers a visual splice with the ocean when viewed from the house or terrace. Photo: Richard Powers As the hikers make their way along the coastal path, not far from the town of El Port de la Selva, some of them stop and take note of a striking contemporary house on a hillside overlooking the Mediterranean. The house – commissioned and owned by Geoff Roberts and Melinda Taylor as a year-round retreat from their daily working life as lawyers in the Hague – is formed of 10 intersecting cubes, which create a series of lenses that face the water and frame views of the sea and coastline. Each of the house’s 10 cubes captures a slightly different vista. Together they create a complex geometry that lends the building character. Photo : Richard Powers ‘We wanted to capture each of the amazing scenes that the site offered,’ says the architect Eduardo Cadaval, of the Barcelona-based practice Cadaval & Solà-Morales. ‘So we came up with this idea of having not just one frontal view, but 10 different ones.’ A Beirut penthouse with breathtaking views of the city Roberts, who grew up in England, and Taylor, who is from Australia, share a love of Spain, and particularly the coast. The couple began by looking for a site that they could drive to if necessary. They also liked the idea of being close to Barcelona, and narrowed their search to the Costa Brava. Taylor found the site on an internet hunt and spotted some work by Cadaval & Solà-Morales. When she and Roberts contacted the practice, they were pleased to find that Clara Solà-Morales knew the Cap de Creus well – her parents live in El Port de la Selva and she spent part of her childhood here. The main living area is arranged around a double-height atrium, which draws in light from both levels of the house. A slim walkway crosses the atrium on the upper level. Photo: Richard Powers The couple and their two children asked for a retreat that made the most of the sea views but was also practical and low-maintenance. ‘We wanted family and friends to be able to come and visit us, and needed spaces to accommodate people in different areas of the house, but without creating separate rooms that are shut away from one another,’ Roberts says. Alcoves formed by the intersecting cubes from which the house is composed create rooms within a room, for example the dining area with its dramatic sea view. Photo: Richard Powers The house is built into the sloping site, with a terrace to the front and an infinity pool facing the sea. A secondary terrace is tucked away to the rear, creating a sheltered zone that offers protection from the occasional tramontana winds. The main living space and kitchen, on the ground floor, are largely open-plan and arranged around a central double-height atrium. The projecting cubes help to define the more distinct areas for dining and sitting, while a high rear window brings extra light into the atrium. Upstairs, two bedrooms are to one side of the atrium, with a further two accessed across a bridge that spans the central void.

White stucco render helps to protect the building from the salt air, and reinforced glazing provides a robust shield from sea breezes, making the house a haven suited to every season. ‘Even in winter, because of the large glass windows and the diffusion of natural light, it feels as though you’re sitting outside,’ Roberts says. ‘During gales or storms it’s stunning to watch the waves crashing on the rocks and the changing patterns in the sky and ocean while safely ensconced inside.’ Waterside Modern by Dominic Bradbury (Thames & Hudson, £19.95) is available from the Telegraph Bookshop for £16.95 plus £1.99 p&p (0844-871 1514; books.telegraph.co.uk) telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T11:05:52.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
