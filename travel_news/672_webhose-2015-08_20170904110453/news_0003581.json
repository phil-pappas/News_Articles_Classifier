The colonial coastal city is a cultural melting pot overflowing with Southern charm and a history as savory the soul food. Consider yourself warned – it is nearly impossible not to fall victim to the city's charms. Explore Downtown \nBridges and steeples fill the Charleston skyline. The colonial streets are lined with ghost-filled mansions wrapped in layers of porches. If those mansions could talk, they would tell tales of pirates, earthquakes and battles. \nMany of those historic homes are open to the public for tours including the 1772 Heyward-Washington House. It is named after owner Thomas Heyward, Jr., who signed the Declaration of Independence, and George Washington who briefly rented the home in 1791. The house is famous for its collection of Charleston-made furniture including the stunning Holmes Bookcase, which is considered to be the finest example of American-made colonial furniture. Other notable homes to visit include the Nathaniel Russell House Museum and Joseph Manigault House. \nThe best way to explore downtown is by foot or carriage tour. Start at the Historic Charleston City Market and wander the aisles filled with handmade sweetgrass baskets, local art and fresh lemonade. Afterwards, head over to Waterfront Park for views of the harbor and the iconic Cooper River Bridge, North America's longest cable-stayed bridge. Walk the bridge's 2.7-mile pedestrian and bike trail for another great view of the city and harbor. \nStroll over to the most photographed place in Charleston—Rainbow Row, thirteen pastel-colored houses along East Bay Street. Continue walking to the Battery, the iconic defensive seawall turned promenade lined with stately antebellum mansions. The Battery offers a view of Fort Sumter, where the first shots of the Civil War were fired in 1861, and the USS Yorktown, a WWII battleship turned museum located at Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum. \nSpend an afternoon exploring the outskirts of town. Highlights include Drayton Hall, the only plantation house on the Ashley River to survive both the Civil and Revolutionary Wars and Angel Oak, a 1,400-year-old oak tree. Weekend tours are available to visit the Hunley, the first combat submarine. It sank during the Civil War in 1864 and was discovered in 1995. Hit the Beaches \nThere's no shortage of beaches in Charleston. Head north to swanky Isle of Palms or Sullivan's Island to explore the streets of colorful houses with quirky names. Catch a few waves down South at laid-back Folly Beach. Walk to the end of the beach for a scenic view of the historic 1876 Morris Island Lighthouse, which now stands several hundred yards offshore due to erosion. Savory Soul Food \nThere is a line outside Jestine's Kitchen for a reason – the fried chicken is legendary. The meat and three restaurant serves up Southern favorites like mac and cheese, banana pudding and collards. Treat yourself to the pumpkin ravioli at Sermet's Downtown – a delectable Mediterranean bistro, conveniently located in the King Street shopping district. Don't forget to make dinner reservations at the Peninsula Grill, located across from the City Market, for a juicy steak or oysters. Be sure to save a little room for their famous coconut cake. Stay \nRest your feet after a long day of exploring Charleston's charms at Two Meeting Street Inn. The luxurious bed and breakfast is located within steps of the famous South Battery seawall and surrounded by a large porch and lush garden. \nTucked across the street from the City Market is the lavish Meeting Street Inn. All rooms feature antique reproduction poster beds and overlook a quaint garden courtyard. \nDetails", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T02:11:21.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
