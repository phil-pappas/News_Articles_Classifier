He is now recovering in a specialist rehabilitation centre in Christchurch. \nA man left fighting for his life after a scooter accident in Thailand is making new memories with his family, after a brain injury left him with short-term memory loss. \nPaul \"PJ\" Lupi, 28, had been assessed as having a \"very severe\" brain injury after his accident in Phuket on July 6, his family said. \nDespite the severity of his injuries, he was making a \"miraculous recovery\" at a rehabilitation centre in Christchurch, brother Joe Lupi said. Supplied \nPJ Lupi in a Bangkok hospital bed where he recovered for weeks after suffering a brain injury from a scoot accident. Lupi was able to give his family a thumbs up when he woke up from his coma. He is now recovering in a Christchurch rehabilitation centre. \nHe was walking with help around the centre, and was able to speak for short periods of time. \n\"He has remembered his family and their names, and recognises them.\" \nPJ's bed at the centre is surrounded by soccer shirts and memorabilia, as well as lots of family photos. PJ is a huge soccer fan, and played for the Miramar Rangers club. \nREAD MORE: \nHe was diagnosed with post-traumatic amnesia, Joe said, which meant he had limited short-term memory. \"He can create memories, and we're looking forward to creating new memories with him over time.\" \nHe would be in the rehabilitation centre for at least three to six months. \nPJ, a Wellington business owner and former Marlborough College head boy, suffered his injury the day before he was due to return from a two-week holiday. Ad Feedback \nHe was wearing a helmet, family said at the time, but the impact of the crash left him in a coma in a Bangkok hospital for weeks. \nHe had not taken out travel insurance, so family and friends took to Givealittle to raise money to help pay for overseas care and transport to New Zealand. \nA month after launching the page, the family had raised more than $173,147 from 1735 donors. \nPJ's treatment was estimated to cost $6000 a day in Bangkok, and the return flight on July 28 about $80,000. \nJoe Lupi said the family's financial situation was \"under control\", but there would be no money left over from the donations. \n\"The bills paid to date run well over the donated funds. Family have covered the difference, however we are very thankful to the many who donated as it has contributed significantly to the overall costs.\" \nPJ still had a long road ahead to recovery, but the family was positive. \n\"His visual ability is intact, his hearing ability is intact, his motor skills are functioning, he does get tired easily ... he still has a lot of brain rewiring to take place, and a long rehabilitation is ahead of him.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T18:23:48.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
