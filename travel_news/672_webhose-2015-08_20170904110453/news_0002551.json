We are not there to simply go surf, brag about it and then bail.” \nThe expedition, scheduled for September, has been approved by the North Korean government, which is eager to boost its small but developing tourism sector. \nAndrea Lee, CEO of Uri Tours , which is organizing the excursion, said it will be used to map out the coastline for prime surfing locations, take risk assessments and develop evacuation and safety plans. \nThough most North Koreans don’t have the means or leisure time to devote themselves to recreational hobbies, she said the government is keen on getting the mapping data and on drawing tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:46:06.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
