During this period, most parts of the country have their hottest season of the year. Nowadays, people can use air-conditioning and electric fans to help relieve the summer heat. However, in ancient times, without such appliances, how did people pass the hot summer? Some cultural items collected in the Palace Museum in Beijing help us to figure out how the royal family of the Qing Dynasty (1644-c1911), who lived inside the Forbidden City, spent the summer days. Costumes for emperors and queens to wear in summer The summer costumes for the royals were mainly made of fabrics such as yarn and silk. The materials were permeable, which keep the wearer cool. A Chinese imperial porcelain teapot with chrysanthemum pattern The summer food and drink in the royal court was mainly various kinds of melons and fruits, as well as tribute tea from around the country. A traditional Chinese fruit bowl and icebox Iceboxes made of wood were widely used in the royal court of the Qing Dynasty. Because of the weak conductivity of heat, lead or tin was put inside the box to extend the hours for preserving the natural ice. Many historical materials record emperors, empresses and imperial concubines using the boxes to keep food such as melons and fruits cool in the hot summer days. The Zhizhai window at the Forbidden City in Beijing Many features of the architecture of the Forbidden City help to relieve the summer heat. The Zhizhai window was one of the great inventions: the upper part could be raised for ventilation, while the lower part could be removed to allow more light in. The royal family of the Qing Dynasty could even enjoy an air-conditioned room in ancient times. Because the icebox often had air holes, it could cool the temperature of the room. A round fan with embroidery of a phoenix resting on a phoenix tree The fan was another necessity for royals in the summer days. Fans at the royal court of the Qing Dynasty varied widely. Exquisitely made, they were more than a tool for cooling people down; they were extraordinary works of art in themselves.
