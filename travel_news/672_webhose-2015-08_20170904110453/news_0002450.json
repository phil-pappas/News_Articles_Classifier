Pic: AAP Image/Paul Miller Source: AAP \nJUST when it seemed airline wars had peaked, Virgin Australia has upped the ante on Qantas in an area certain to appeal to business travellers. \nTo coincide with the launch of a new business class suite for its A330 fleet, Virgin Australia has teamed up with Nespresso to deliver the “finest quality of coffee in the sky”. \nThe newly refitted Business Class cabin will feature the first Nespresso by B/E Aerospace machines in the world, designed to overcome the challenges of making coffee at altitude.
