TV University is an all volunteer organization that is an adjunct to STAYinTV. TV University provides classes lasting from two hours to several weeks on a variety of subjects. Teachers are recruited from within the community and are vetted by a board of directors. Instructors range from a professor at Duke University to a retired analytical chemist who has a lifelong interest in Astronomy. The health classes related to food are taught by a Registered dietitian. The following is a list of classes coming this Fall:\nTellico Skies Astronomy\nPhotoshop Elements\nPersonal Investment Management\nThe Art of Glass Through Paperweights\nUsing Your Computer: Brochures, Newsletters, Flyers\nThe First Amendment - What are we entitled to Say, Print and Pray?\nTo Your Health - Falls / What's the Big Deal? Balance and Fall Prevention\nTo Your Health -Enhancing Health with Functional Food\nMany have found Tellico Village on Tellico Lake a dream come true winner of Real Estate Scorecard's Bliss Award for 2014 Happiest Community of the Year . Villagers have formed their own non-profit University specifically to provide lifelong learning for senior villagers. TV University is a part of the STAYinTV initiative. STAYinTV was started as a part of the national trend of helping retired folks figure out how to live in their homes as long as possible, allowing them to age in place rather than relocating to another facility. STAYinTV's goal is to identify the changing needs of the Villagers and provide assistance that allows the residents to age in place at home in Tellico Village. The STAYinTV program includes help in the following areas: home maintenance, rides, grocery shopping, respite care, downsizing, and how to plan it all so folks can stay in their home sweet home as long as possible. Research is discovering people are happier and living longer and healthier lives when allowed to stay in familiar surroundings and age in place.\nFounded in 1986 comprised of 5,000 wooded acres located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, Tellico Village is one of the finest waterfront retirement communities on the shores of Tellico Lake. Tellico Lake was created by one of the last dams built by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The lakefront community boasts a wealth of amenities, the Tellico Village Yacht Club has lakefront dining. Additional amenities at the village: indoor swimming pool, new pickleball courts, a state-of-the-art wellness center with exercise classes, tennis courts and 3 private golf courses and, last but not least, a marina for boating. Knoxville, Tennessee is about 20 minutes away and provides resources of a bigger city. Great medical care - the University of Tennessee Teaching Hospital, dining in farm to table restaurants, theatre and of course, SEC college football if folks are a fan of the Big Orange. Many football fans boat to the games at Neyland Stadium (capacity 102,000) rather than drive due to the proximity to the Tennessee River. Asheville, North Carolina and Chattanooga, Tennessee are easy drives and if a big city is needed Atlanta, Georgia is about 4 hours south.\nAn easy place to visit, the Great Smoky Mountains feature springlike weather in the summer, spectacular fall foliage colors and mild, maybe one or two snowfalls, in the winter. Spring brings abundant colors in flowering Dogwoods, Rhododendrons, Mountain Laurels and wildflowers. This area is also home to some of the most dramatic waterfalls in the Eastern United States due to the abundant rainfall in the upper elevations of the Smokies.\nReal Estate Scorecard encourages folks to visit Tellico Lake and experience the life of a Villager.
