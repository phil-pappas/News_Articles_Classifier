P2P’s full-season courses were launched in 2009 by the British ski tour operator Powder Byrne, which has been sending guests to the lift-linked towns of Flims and Laax for 30 years. To date, the P2P course has produced 40 graduates, 16 of whom have gone on to teach with the Flims Ski School. When I visit Laax in February to spend a few days on the course with the trio of winter 2014/15 \"gappies\" – Rupert, Jemima and Eli – five P2P graduates are teaching full-time, with several more coming out for peak weeks to work during their university holidays. I arrive during a special week in the course, designed to acquaint students with the full range of winter sports, and spend a day freeriding with them followed by a day's ice climbing. They'd already been ski touring and snowshoeing earlier in the week and, with stereotypical teenage lethargy, seemed most excited about having the following day off. I, however, am excited by the prospect of exploring the ski area with 24-year-old Alex, a graduate of the first P2P course in 2009 who’s worked as an instructor here ever since. Students get a child-specific ski instructor course as part of P2P Photo: Markus Casutt Taking part in a vocational gap year course between school and university is a popular option both for ambitious youngsters and their concerned parents – participants travel abroad and gain invaluable life experience, yet do so in a controlled environment. In the case of P2P, the course lasts a full winter season from early December to April (18 weeks) rather than the more typical eight or 10 weeks. Pastoral care comes in the form of previous gappies and Powder Byrne resort staff, with whom the new recruits share accommodation. The full-season course isn't cheap, and most of the past and present gappies have been funded by the Bank of Mum and Dad, although they protest earnestly: \"We've got paying jobs, so we're paying them back!\" And, as 24-year-old graduate Anna explains, \"Having gained my qualifications during my gap year, I could return to Flims to teach during my university holidays, earning enough to cover my travel and living costs in resort, plus pay off day to day uni costs before they spiralled into debt.\" Dealing with clients and teaching starts early with P2P; having arrived at the beginning of December, the gappies don Powder Byrne uniforms to help reps take care of guests over Christmas, and have already gained hands-on ski instruction experience by February by assisting fully-qualified instructors. \"Right from the start you're treated like a member of staff, which builds tremendous confidence,\" says Jemima. It's not all skiing: gappies get to try a range of other activities off the slopes However, respect has to be earned, as Simon Meeke, director of Powder Byrne, explains: \"We're looking for the right people to represent us, so we invite potential P2P candidates for interview first, to assess whether they'll muck in and become a valuable part of the resort team.\" As well as making it past the interview stage, prospective gappies must be able to ski any piste in control and with good technique to be accepted onto the course – as a benchmark they should have 10 to 15 weeks of skiing under their belt. Once on the course, if students pass the BASI 1 and 2 exams while also meeting Powder Byrne and Flims Ski School's exacting standards, they are guaranteed an instructing job with the ski school the following winter. Powder Byrne limits the number of students per P2P cohort, taking a maximum of 10 per season, to ensure there will be jobs for all if they wish. When I ask the gang to describe a typical P2P day, they struggle – because it varies so much over the length of the course. There's on-snow and in-classroom training for BASI exams (the price of the course includes all level 1 training and exams, and students can opt to also do level 2 but must pay extra); a week-long children's instruction course; a fortnight spent shadowing instructors; helping backstage at major events like the Freeski Burton European Open; and working alongside the local ski patrol and rental shop team. As 20-year-old P2P graduate Angus says: \"Absolutely everything about working in a ski resort is covered.\" Gappies get training such as what to do in case of injury Photo: Markus Casutt Ask them for highlights of the course and the answer is unanimous: \"How well we all get on.\" The bond between the current and past gappies is palpable; they even have a tradition of sharing Christmas dinner together every year at Anna's parents' holiday home in the resort. They're equally united when asked about the place they call their winter home. \"We have the option to go elsewhere, but we choose not to,\" says 23-year-old Ben. \"I love skiing in other resorts but Laax has a massive ski area [235km pistes, four snowparks and the world's largest halfpipe] with far fewer people on the slopes.\" I didn't take a gap year but I did travel for over three years after leaving university, spending two winters waitressing in Aspen, Colorado. I wouldn't change my experiences for the world but, if I were to have my time again, in today's infinitely more challenging job market, I think I’d be tempted to opt for skiing to gain qualifications rather than tips.
