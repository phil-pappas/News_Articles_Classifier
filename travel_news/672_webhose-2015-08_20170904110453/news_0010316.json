As the name suggests, hill towns are built on a hill. They usually have a medieval center and may have walls enclosing the historic center or a castle at the top. They are also good places to go for a view of the surrounding countryside. \nHere are my picks for top Italian hill towns. Click on the town name for visiting information. Siena. by Martha Bakerjian • Siena, Tuscany \nSiena, in the heart of Tuscany, is a good example of a classic hill town but it's larger than many of the others. The town is famous for its palio festival , a horse race run around the town's fan-shaped main square, il Campo . Don't miss the Cathedral complex that includes not only the beautiful duomo itself with its inlaid mosaic floors but also the Baptistery and Crypt under the cathedral. For stunning views of Siena, climb the 505 steps up Torre del Mangia , the bell tower on the main square. \nA smaller choice that's more off the tourist track is Pitigliano in southern Tuscany, dramatically perched on a tufa ridge that's dotted with Etruscan tombs. More » Close-up of Orvieto Duomo Facade. © by Martha Bakerjian • Orvieto, Umbria \nOrvieto is known for its medieval cathedral with a gleaming mosaic facade, a Romanesque-Gothic masterpiece. The town is dramatically perched on a tufa cliff that's riddled with underground passages, many dating from Etruscan times, and has a small castle where an Etrucan temple once stood. Orvieto is a center for Majolica pottery. \nAn off the beaten path favorite is Panicale as well as the nearby Paciano . More » San Leo. by Martha Bakerjian • San Leo, Emilia Romagna \nSan Leo is a small fortress town that presents a beautiful picture as you approach. Walk along the main stree,   wander on the small side streets. Be sure to try the local “fossa” cave-aged cheese (and white truffles in fall). \nAnother of my favorites in Emilia Romagna is the small town of Castell'Arquato , topped by a castle. More » • Urbino, le Marche \nUrbino is a Renaissance hill town with an impressive Ducal Palace that houses one of Italy's top collections of Renaissance paintings in 80 of the palace's renovated rooms. Urbino's university dates from 1506 and the town is a center for Majolica ceramics. Its historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and there's a small 14th century fortress at the top of the town. \nAlso in le Marche, the old town of Sassoferrato is a charming hill town. More » View of Ragusa Ibla. by Martha Bakerjian • Ragusa Ibla, Sicily \nRagusa is an unusual town, divided into two parts, the Upper Town and Ibla. After the earthquake of 1693 destroyed most of the town, half the people decided to build on the ridge above town and the other half renovated the old town. Ibla, which is now a stunning hill town. Its Baroque architecture makes it a UNESCO World Heritage site. \nIn western Sicily, Erice is a pretty hill town to visit. More » Monte Sant'Angelo. © 2011 by Martha Bakerjian • Monte Sant'Angelo, Puglia \nMonte Sant'Angelo, on the Gargano Promontory or the spur of the boot , is a stunning white town with a castle, museum of traditional life, and a picturesque historic center. Many people come to see the Sanctuary of the Archangel Michael but the town itself is definitely worth a visit. \nFarther south in Puglia, Oria has a 13th-century castle and cathedral with a museum and mummy crypt. More » View of Portovenere with Castle Above. by James Martin • Portovenere, Liguria \nPortovenere is a colorful seaside town on the Gulf of Poets near the famous Cinque Terre villages but less crowded. Narrow medieval streets lead up the hill from the old city gate to the castle. The picturesque Church of San Pietro sits on a rocky outcrop at the edge of the promontory. \nAnother Liguria favorite is La Pigna , the old town in Sanremo , with its tangle of colorful pedestrian-only streets winding up the hill to Madonna della Costa Sanctuary . More » Soave Fortifications. by Martha Bakerjian • Soave, Veneto \nSoave is a small wine town enclosed by medieval walls with a castle above and a moat on two sides. Its well-preserved 13th century fortifications have 24 towers. You can visit the castle and its museum. In town there are medieval buildings and a few places to taste the Soave wine. In May they hold a medieval wine festival and during summer there are concerts. \nAsolo is another charming hill town to visit in Veneto. More » Barolo Photo. by Martha Bakerjian • Barolo, Piemonte \nBarolo, famous for its wine, is one of several hill towns in Piemonte's Langhe wine region , a picturesque area dotted with hill towns and pretty villages. Barolo's castle is now a museum and below it is a large wine tasting center. \nLa Morra is another good hill town to visit in the Langhe area. More » \nMatera, in southern Italy, is more like an inverted hill town. From the more \"modern\" 13th century town, the old sassi district with its cave houses and churches spills down the hill. \nAlso visit Maratea on the west coast, sometimes called the Pearl of the Tyrrhenian .
