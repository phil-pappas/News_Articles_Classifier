The film, set in the San Francisco of the 1970s, tells how a sexually precocious 15 year old girl, desperate to lose her virginity, seduces Monroe, her divorced mother’s 35 year old boyfriend, who she believes, briefly, is the handsomest man in the world. The handsomest man is far from unwilling and there is much nudity, swearing and explicit animation as the seduction proceeds to actual sex. Minnie, the main character, also practises her wiles on just about every other boy in sight, even though she considers herself fat and unattractive. Based on an autobiographical novel by cartoonist Phoebe Gloeckner, the movie will have older viewers wondering: are (or were) 15 year old girls really like this , thinking about sex all the time, and maybe doing it, plus writing it up in X-rated detail in their secret diaries, when they should be concentrating on their history homework? The answer, I’m afraid, is yes. Although my own diaries at the same age are tame in the extreme when compared to Phoebe Gloeckner ’s salacious account, they reveal exactly the same propensity to try my seductive arts on just about every boy I meet. And even if most 15 year olds in the 1950s, including myself, were far too innocent, nervous and ignorant to have sex itself, especially in those pre-pill days, we were already boy mad, and thought about little else. Yet much like Minnie in the film, we were not particularly discerning. Almost anybody would do. In my case, there was very little choice anyway as I came from a small town where the pool of available talent was minute. I was further restricted by my entire social life in those days revolving around the church. So I start off 1959 by recording that I walked home from church with a boy I fancied, John Lamb. He did not find favour for long as by the middle of January, I am writing: \"John Lamb’s character: rather a show-off, boasting all the time. He believes himself to be a great lover and angry young man type.\" I was 14, nearly 15, he was 16 and he lived just down the road. By February, I am on to new conquests: \"Martin Ballard, the new adorable. Oh Martin! I could hug you, kiss you, squeeze you. Martin is the 8th adorable so far. I enjoyed myself with Martin!\" The adorable Martin gets no more mentions. Talk about fickle! But somebody else soon comes in to fill the gap and on March 2nd, 1959, I am writing: \"Don’t say I’m falling into the tender trap of falling in love with Harold Noble of all people. I stayed talking to him and we got pretty close (no, not that close).\" Harold was our church youth leader, aged about 26 at the time. An older man! A later March entry reveals that I had been \"very romantic as regards Harold Noble over the weekend. The others think I am throwing myself at him but I have an overwhelming desire to do so. Just to be near him helps. Perhaps after this conference (we were at a residential church youth event) my emotions and feelings towards him will wear off.\" On March 31, during the school holidays: \"I am posing for Mr Boulton (the art teacher.) He brought two of his daughters in the afternoon – chaperones?\" He was painting my portrait at the school, with just the two of us there. It would never be allowed today. But nothing untoward happened although I record \"I am nervous at being painted by him.\" I have not yet finished with Harold Noble, though. On April 1, after some event I write: \"Harold, darling Harold was there.\" On April 29: \"Saw darling Harold, the Casanova. Why is there this thing about him that beats girls’ hearts to such a flame of love?\" On May 8: \"Had long talk with Harold – alone – in his car and told him I’d like to walk down the cemetery lane with him in the dark \" Harold now fades away and another person enters, Mr Bellamy, our new history teacher. I write: \"Mr Bellamy shocked with surprise when I got 9 ½ out of 10 for a history test. I nearly ate the book!\" A further entry: \"History with darling inimitable Mr Bellamy. Hard luck he’s sweet on Suzanne. Or is he? I doubt it.\" Suddenly, I was getting top marks in history, which just shows what a difference a favourite teacher can make. As for Harold, the feet of clay are now firmly set: \"Not half as keen on Harold as I was and I don’t know whether I like him at all. He’s so bigoted, pig-headed and narrow-minded and tactless.\" Similar disillusion sets in with Minnie, in the film. So that’s Harold out of the running and by August 1959 I have a new love, Ricky, the Belgian coach driver on our school trip to Austria. I write: \"I think I adore Ricky; he’s so charming. The boys have taught him some dirty words. I daren’t put them down here.\" And just as the trip is about to end: \"Oh, how I do adore Ricky. He said he would kiss me goodbye if I had no lipstick on (?)\" Ricky was forgotten after the trip was over and a new boy entered my life, Tony Walkey. Yes, I adored him too, and could not wait to see him again after we had played table tennis together at the St Ives Youth Club. \"Tony, Tony, Tony, I am mad with longing. When shall I see you again?\" No ‘teenage’ diary written by an adult can ever quite capture the mind of a 15-year old After a desultory postcard from Tony and one more meeting, I never saw him again and by the end of the year I am going out with somebody new and also from church, Ray. Much like the clean-cut young men in the musical The Book of Mormon , Ray was a 19-year old lay preacher, a kind of Elder. That relationship soon finished as well, and if it were not for my diary entries, I would hardly remember these people. Whatever happened to them? I have no idea. I soon became an atheist as well, so my former source of supply completely dried up. As for losing my virginity, that had to wait until I was at university, a little more clued-up and ready for a real relationship. But why keep a diary at all, when the chances of anybody else reading it, are remote? Teenage diaries are valuable, I think, as they record your personality in its formative stages. No ‘teenage’ diary written by an adult can ever quite capture the mind of a 15-year old and even if you later shudder at meeting your much younger self on the diary pages, at least you know that you were recording your raw, authentic thoughts and feelings at the time. You cannot go back and feel again what you felt at 15. And if nothing else, my teenage diaries may one day give my granddaughters a laugh. At the moment, though, entries after the age of 15 are censored. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T09:19:10.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
