For starters, staff heard about an initiative called Pack for a Purpose, a charitable entity that exists to raise funds for school supplies because not every Holy Family student can afford them. Given the contagion of this terrific philanthropic effort, before long, guests staying at the resort caught wind of it and asked how they could help too! \nThese days, both staff and guests of the Hopkins Bay Resort have become members of an elite family eager to reach beyond providing pens, paper and books. There’s a plan afoot to build a new classroom to expand the school (best estimates are that $10,000 BZD should accomplish this project) and there’s a feeding scheme on deck to underwrite the cost of feeding each child breakfast and lunch costing $4 BZD per student, per day. Down the road, playground equipment, building improvements and computers will be added to the list. \nBut perhaps the most ambitious effort of all is a perpetual “Kick Start Program” to help families unable to afford the $40 annual tuition required to attend Holy Family. That dilemma will be history for 25-percent of the school population who haven’t the money to pay their fees. To reward guests of Hopkins Bay who are kind enough to contribute to this effort, they’re invited to be a guest of the school so they can see the impact their generosity has had on this small school and its’ students. \nWhat’s down the road? The establishment of “environmental clubs” for children attending Holy Family so they understand more about their homeland’s commitment to the environment is the next project. They’ll be given chances to apply the lessons they learn in the classroom by undertaking ecological projects that compliment the curricula. \nVolunteers are welcome to help out and donations are particularly important if the school hopes to attain its goals, so whether you have a talent or skill that can further the aforementioned projects or you’d like to make a monetary donation, every little bit helps.
