With some of you expecting to make that all-important phone call today, have a last-minute read of what these four students had to say about Clearing. Visit the Telegraph's Clearing page for more information and tips. Ben Russell, second-year Games Technology student at Bournemouth University: Make sure you're really organised; get numbers, get emails and talk to people. All the tutors and staff have done [Clearing] a million times before, so they’re going to be able to help. Clearing gave me the opportunity to change to something I really wanted to do – computer science to games technology – and I think I’m better off for it; I’ve enjoyed the course far more than I would have enjoyed computer science. My advice would be to just try and sort out as much as you can beforehand, and in terms of accommodation, don’t be afraid to talk to people. I had to sort that out on the day, because the university ran out really quickly. I found a Facebook page dedicated to finding housemates, I don’t think it was set up by the university but I looked at all the posts, saw all the houses available, and looked for people who were just after one other person. I think Clearing can be hugely beneficial. I know some people really have their mind set on what they want to do, and don’t want to change it; but I feel as if I’ve done a lot better at Bournemouth than I would have done at any other university.

Ben Russell is studying at Bournemouth University Rebecca Jones, English Literature graduate from the University of Liverpool: My plan was to do a philosophy degree and to carry on with law afterwards. To me…it was all about getting to Cambridge. On Results Day, as I discovered my grades ABC, I won’t hide that I went into a mini meltdown. I hadn't met the requirements, which were ABB. Clearing was something I disregarded. My grades had always been excellent and I was one of my class's top students. So in my mind it was only for those who weren’t expected to meet the grades. But my sister pushed me as she found out that the University of Liverpool was offering a place for English literature through Clearing. “Let’s ring Liverpool! Let’s give it a go!” she told me. The Clearing team I talked to on the phone were lovely and very understanding. But it was definitely my visit to Liverpool which was the turning point. I came for a Clearing open day. The university and its surroundings were so inviting and wonderful that I completely changed my mind. Now I can’t imagine my life differently to the one I chose since Clearing. One thing I do regret is my stubbornness. I should have looked at other possibilities before Results Day; I should have visited other universities than Cambridge, just to keep doors opened. Now I realise how important it is to keep other options available. Read more about Rebecca's interview. Rebecca Jones Clearing case study 2015 Photo: Liverpool Girl Geeks Daryl Verner, graduate from the University of Derby Originally, I was doing a plumbing course at college. I didn’t like it though, I thought it was awful and I kept thinking to myself ‘I really need to do something with my life’. It was that feeling that motivated me to do something different. I had always liked sport and I’d always wanted to be a PE teacher, so I decided to do my A-levels and then apply for a Higher National Diploma Course (HND). The funny thing is, I hadn’t even thought about applying to university. I found a few universities that interested me and had vacancies and I phoned them up directly. I remember calling Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Derby. While I was still deciding which university to go for, I got a call back from Derby, from their head of sport. She spoke to me about the course, what it involved, the career possibilities, and then she talked about the city itself. She really sold it to me and completely won me over – I really appreciated the extra effort that they put in, it was an easy choice. Looking back on it, I have no regrets. My experience through Clearing has been really successful and I’ve loved being at Derby. They’ve been really helpful and there was always someone I could talk to if I needed to. Now, I couldn’t be happier. I’ve managed to get a scholarship to do a masters at Derby is psychology and, with my degree in sports, I’m hoping to come out of it and go into sports psychology.

Leanne Town, Web Design and Marketing graduate from the University of Northampton From the beginning, Clearing seemed like a chance for me to open up my career opportunities. At the time, I was working for a mobile beauty business. I had been feeling the need for change, and decided to get a new job. I soon realised how helpful qualifications can be when seeking employment, and I didn't have any grades except for my GCSEs. The idea to go to university progressively took shape, and my mother's support definitely encouraged me to go for it. Ucas notified me I had to go through Clearing. I didn’t know much about the process, and I thought I probably wouldn’t get in, but I decided to give it a go. I don’t remember being stressed at all, either. I think the whole process was quite simple. If you apply for Clearing, just make sure you start the process as soon as possible. And don’t get put off by it. I didn’t have A-levels grades, but it opened my chances to go to university, thanks to letters of recommendation and references. And, as things turned out, I can say it was definitely worth keeping faith in. Read more about Leanne's interview.
