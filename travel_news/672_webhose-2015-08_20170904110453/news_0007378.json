Unknown to many is that most reported news is taking place outside of the KRI. Like many places (Paris, New York and London), Kurdistan has had its security issues but is actually one of the most secure regions in the Middle East. This Guide is more than a beautiful pictorial of a fascinating land; it is a message to the world; Kurdistan is open for business and ready as always to receive guests from around the world. \nKurdistan is unlike the rest of chaotic Iraq, and is often referred to as The Other Iraq. Kurdistan is a land of rivers, lakes and snow-covered mountains, with an abundance of historical and archeological sites. Kurds are warm and friendly—eager to express the hospitality that has made them famous. \nThe 400 page Guide contains everything from how to get there to the photographically illustrated histories of nearly two hundred enchanting sites. There are fascinating articles by famous Kurds and International friends of the Kurds dealing with subjects such as the emerging Kurdish film industry, music, art, literature and even recipes for Kurdish food. \nJune 2015 - This Guide is extensive, up-to-date and carefully prepared. It is not only for the adventurous souls, but also for everyone curious to know more about this other side of Iraq. I have made three unforgettable trips to Kurdistan, in 2012, 2013 and 2015 - Laila Gustafsson, Sweden \n• The official launch of the Guide in Europe was hosted in the UK House of Commons June 2015 \n• The official launch of the Guide in the USA will be September 16th, 2015/6 PM at the Rayburn House Office Building # B339. \nThe event will be hosted by Ms. Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman, Senior Representative of The Kurdistan Regional Government, Washington, DC, in co-operation with the Kurdish American Congressional Caucus and the US Kurdistan Business Council. \nVIPs addressing the event include General (retired) James Jones, Jr., former U.S. National Security Advisor, U.S. Congressman Marsha Blackburn, Michael Delaney, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative and Dr. Douglas Layton, Guide Editor and others TBA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:38:02.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
