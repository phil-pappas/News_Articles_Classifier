Dressing appropriately is important and bringing useful gear will be a big help. Prepare In Advance You want to be prepared for the tour you've chosen. You should include sunglasses, a good hat with a brim, and hydrating refreshments, on any tour. Comfortable, sturdy closed shoes and breathable clothing are important on any tour that includes being outside. Knowing in advance what activities you will participate in will help you plan better. Spending Time At The Canyon With landing tours, you will exit the helicopter and explore your surroundings. Landing tours typically go to the West Rim out of Vegas. Some of these fun excursions include a champagne picnic on the banks of the Colorado River. Deluxe tours can have a champagne picnic, plus a boat ride down the river and a trip to the Canyon Skywalk. Since you'll do a lot of walking, you want to wear shoes made for comfort and safety with closed toes. All landing tours go to the West Rim where it gets very hot from July to September. You may experience days when the temperature soars over 100 degrees. So, if you'll be outdoors on a landing tour, you want to pack salty snacks and extra water or sports drinks. You should wear loose, breathable clothing, preferably made of cotton or a wicking material. Your clothes need to keep you cool and keeping moisture away helps, too. Air Tours Only Air only tours are often more affordable. Like many landing tours, air only tours go over popular sites like the Hoover Dam, Grand Canyon, Colorado River and Lake Mead. South Rim tours are air only tours because helicopters can't fly beneath the rim. The longer, 50-minute tour is the best one to take at the South Rim because it flies over 75 percent of the entire national park. You can add on outdoor adventures at the South Rim too, and one of your options is a fun jeep tour through the park. While the temperatures are cooler at the South Rim than they are at the West Rim, you'll still want to dress in breathable, protective clothing if you go on the jeep tour. Bell Rangers vs EcoStars Different styles of Grand Canyon helicopters can affect what you wear. Basic helicopter air tours use Bell Ranger or A Star models while deluxe tours use EcoStar helicopters. The difference is in the comfort. The EcoStar helicopter has significant climate control to keep you cool during your flight. Other benefits you'll enjoy on an EcoStar include comfortable seating, a smooth and quiet ride, and fantastic views through massive wraparound windows. If you are prone to getting cold in air conditioned settings, then be sure to take a light jacket on your EcoStar tour. Have A Great Time! Being prepared is the first step in having a wonderful time on your air tour over the Grand Canyon. Just remember to dress comfortably, wear sturdy shoes, use sun protection, and take along snacks and drinks, and you'll be all set for a fantastic trip. \n  South Rim helicopters .
