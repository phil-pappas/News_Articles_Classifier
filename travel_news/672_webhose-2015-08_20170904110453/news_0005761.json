Will this revive the fortunes of a classic seaside town?... Away with the fairies: A weekend on the magical Isle of Man... Feeling like a Bedouin king on a 'Middle Eastern' camel ride... 26 shares As soon as we'd unzipped the tent flaps to our tipi and clocked the hand-carved four-poster, log-burner and fluffy reindeer skins on the floor, I knew I'd settle in beautifully.\nThe attention to detail is astonishing - pegs carved into the bedposts for hanging your clothes, heated towel rail, electric blanket, bedside lamps and overhead reading lights.\nEach tent is set in its own clearing in the woods with a decked area for your barbecue and a double hammock slung between the trees.\nIt's utterly private and, aside from the odd cooing pigeon or tooting owl, completely silent.\nThe boardwalks across the site are lit by sensor lamps.\nStep outside and you immediately have a floodlit path to your barbecue area, tree shower, flushing loo and basin.\nThat it rained fairly incessantly on our first day was a plus - showering in piping hot water while the rain pours in through the open-air roof will be an enduring memory.\nIt reminded me somehow of Bali or Thailand; hard to believe we were in the midst of rural Dorset.\nThe real attraction to a break like this is the opportunity to cut off from daily life.\nLyme Regis is just a few miles away and, down the road, the Iron-Age fort Pilsdon Pen with views right across Dorset.\nBut we found it almost impossible to drag ourselves away from the woodland.\nThere is something about sleeping amid trees and being so close to the elements which makes time slow gloriously and, in the end, that was the best anniversary treat of all.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own break at Crafty Camping Bell tents at Crafty Camping (01460 221 102, www.mallinson.co.uk ) from £84 a night low season (Nov 1 - March 27, except Christmas and New Year).\nYurts, tipi and shepherd's hut from £120 a night. The site is open throughout the winter.", "external_links": ["http://www.mallinson.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1Lf4Mkd"], "published": "2015-08-17T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:53:09.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
