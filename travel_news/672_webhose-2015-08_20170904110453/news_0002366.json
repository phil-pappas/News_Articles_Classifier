From 23 until 27 September 2015, The PGA Centenary Course will be set up with flag positions as they were during the final Ryder Cup singles matches, and there will be the opportunity to play from a select number of Championship tees during each round. Golfers will also be announced on the first tee by Gleneagles’ Starters, to get a small taster of the pressure US and European players faced during last year’s showdown. \nThroughout the week, players can submit their scorecards to be in with a chance of winning a variety of Ryder Cup-related prizes for the best daily and weekly gross scores. In addition, a special stay and play package is available on Sunday 27 September, offering overnight accommodation, breakfast, and a round of golf for two people on The PGA Centenary Course for a reduced rate of £460 per room, per night (just £230 per person). Gary Silcock, Gleneagles’ Director of Golf, commented: “The atmosphere during last September’s Matches at Gleneagles was phenomenal, and The 2014 Ryder Cup definitely ranks among one of the most exciting sporting events Scotland has ever hosted. Not many sporting fans get to play Wembley or Wimbledon, but here any golfer who books a tee time can test their game against some of the challenges that Team US and Team Europe faced. “We’re setting the course up just like that great week last year – the only thing missing will be the 250,000 spectators, but I’m sure the whole resort will ‘buzz’ again on the anniversary weekend.” In September (Monday 6 and Tuesday 7), Gleneagles will also join forces with Blairgowrie Golf Club – Host Venue of the 2014 Junior Ryder Cup – to host the inaugural Legacy Trophy, a 36-hole stableford competition. This sold-out event, played across The PGA Centenary Course and Rosemount Course at Blairgowrie, will see amateur golfers battle it out for a total prize fund of £2,000.
