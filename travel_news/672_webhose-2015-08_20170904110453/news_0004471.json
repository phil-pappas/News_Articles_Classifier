The move to produce fresh water, made from desalinated ocean water, is one of the luxury resort’s newest steps towards delivering services with a sound environmentally-friendly purpose. \n“With the move to producing our own drinking water, we expect to save around 3,000 kilos of empty plastic bottles each year,” said general manager, Carsten Schieck. “Producing our own water saves on importing tonnes of bottled water each year and more importantly of course, greatly reduces the number of plastic bottles we need to dispose of in a country that’s still working on refining its recycling capabilities. \nThe five-star island resort expects to produce around 400 litres of drinking water every day – including both still and sparkling varieties – saving the importation of around 12 tonnes of drinking water each month. Tucked away in the middle of the staff village, the bottling plant is located behind the resort’s water desalination plant from where the water is piped in and undergoes two more rounds of filtration and sterilisation to ensure it meets international drinking standards. The water is served to guests in glass bottles which are then returned to the bottling plant for washing and re-filling. \nFuture ecological plans include the planting of organic herb gardens on the island, collecting rain water, recycling ‘grey water’ to use for watering the gardens in times of drought, identifying composting and waste re-use opportunities and increasing usage of solar power in various areas. \nAbout us: Hideaway Beach Resort & Spa is a privately owned all-suite resort set in the beautiful north of the Maldives; a 75-minute seaplane flight from the capital Malé. With some of the largest villas in the country, the stunning five star resort offers guests the luxury of space and privacy across 297,000 square metres. Home to a unique double coral reef, endless sandy beaches and some 48 dive spots close by, the natural beauty of the resort has to be seen to be believed. The resort offers an extensive programme of wellness and sporting experiences, and exciting culinary offerings in its four restaurants and bars. Characterised by its intimate ambience and remote location, the island resort stays true to its name and offers guests ‘a true hideaway’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:58:20.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
