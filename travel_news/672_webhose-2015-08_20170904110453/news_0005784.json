From the 13th hole onwards, the course turns seaward, sweeping across glorious links terrain towards the Mediterranean, before finishing with a fabulous par-four set, driving from an elevated tee along the craggy coastline.\nAlso a par-72, the West Course features one of the most memorable finishes anywhere in the world with the final four holes set alongside the Mediterranean, and complementing the two layouts are extensive practice facilities including a double-ended driving range and excellent golf academy.\nVerdura, also a member of Leading Hotels of the World, has won widespread recognition across the luxury global travel industry since opening in 2009 with honours including a ‘Golden Award for Golf‘ at the 2015 Voyages & Hôtels Readers Awards and being named ‘Best Family European Golf Resort‘ by the 2011 Tatler Travel Guide.\nSituated on Sicily’s southern coast between Agrigento and the fishing city of Sciacca, an 80-minute drive from Trapani and Palermo airports, the resort features 203 rooms and suites while other sports and leisure facilities include six tennis courts, a 60m two-tiered infinity pool, a 170sqm fully-equipped gym and an award-winning 4,000sqm spa complex.\nIn addition, guests can sample an authentic taste of traditional Sicily with an array of locally-sourced dishes at one of Verdura’s four first-class restaurants.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:48:05.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
