Attached to this is an Administration Portal to prioritize the admission approval process and to log patient information. b4checkin also installed an automated criminal record background check feature.\n“We knew that our requirement of an out-of-the-box booking engine would be a challenge for any booking engine provider to complete, but b4checkin came highly recommended by our property management system provider. We couldn’t be happier that we approached them. b4checkin was with us every step of the way during the development process and the final product speaks for itself,” said Edward Cho, Information Technology Manager, Ronald McDonald House New York.\n“b4checkin is pleased that RMH-NY chose us to undertake this development project. This project was made possible by our leading edge adaptive reservation platform and we’re excited to help RMH streamline its unique booking processes.” said Steve Miles, VP Operations, b4checkin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:21:48.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
