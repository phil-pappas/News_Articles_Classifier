The theatre’s events department registered a growing number of corporate sector bookings over the past financial year, with clients such as KPMG, Diesel Ltd, BBC and Travers Smith all hosting events at the venue. The sales upswing is attributed to both a strong track record of client retention and an increase in direct marketing to existing and prospective clients. \nThe in-house catering team also saw an increase in food sales of 2% compared to 2013-14. Contributing factors include an increased use of the Garden Court Café for private events and the additional day-time catering derived from the growth in corporate event sales. Sadler’s Wells Events Manager Georgie Smith said: “The team here at Sadler’s Wells have been brilliant at working together to help drive new business opportunities. With the extensive venue refurbishment and an increased investment in sustainability initiatives, tech facilities and marketing efforts we have really developed and enhanced our events offering here over the past 12 months and, as a consequence, have seen some fantastic results. “Profits in the events department are reinvested back into dance initiatives, so we are really proud to be supporting the business along with the future of dance.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T01:53:18.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
