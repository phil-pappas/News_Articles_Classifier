Images are taken every 10 minutes beginning one hour before sunrise and ending one hour after sunset, and are archived dating back to January 1, 2015. PanoCam is available on the Space Needle's website and through kiosks on the Observation Deck. \n\"The Space Needle was built to be the perfect perch to see the beauty of the Pacific Northwest,\" said Vice President of Marketing, Karen Olson. \"Now with the PanoCam, we can capture and share the best views of the city â€“ from glowing sunrises, to peak-a-view foggy days to some of the most beautiful sunsets on the west coast.\" \nPanoCam uses the world's most advanced webcam with imaging technology from Roundshot Livecam of Lustdorf, Switzerland. A camera mounted on the Space Needle's spire takes individual images of up to 66 million pixels that are automatically stitched together, creating a complete panoramic view. The technology is new, and the Space Needle is the only tower or office building in the U.S. using it at this time. \nThe Space Needle will save all images in an archive that is available to the public, and plans to use the images to record changes to Seattle's skyline in the years to come. The Space Needle is curating a collection of \"Best Shots,\" panoramas taken on days when the weather was exceptionally clear or foggy, along with some of the best sunrises and sunset shots. On the website, \"Best Views\" can be seen via the menu on the right side of the screen.
