Others are preparing for what they see as the inevitable day when the U.S. allows open travel.\nThe latest to act was Carnival Corp., which announced this month that it will begin cruises to the island next May for cultural exchanges. But so many more businesses are excited that South Florida attorney Pedro Freyre calls it “a tsunami of interest.”\nHis team at Cuba Practice Group at law firm Akerman LLP has visited the island at least 10 times this year, mainly to accompany clients looking to develop travel-related business. He plans four more trips this summer alone — more than his three-member team made all of last year.\n“The phone hasn’t stopped ringing since Dec. 17” when President Barack Obama announced a more open policy toward Cuba and plans to renew diplomatic ties, Freyre said. “We’re swamped.”\nCuba is banking on tourism as an economic engine, especially if financially troubled Venezuela reduces support to the island.\nCuba already ranks as the second-largest tourist destination in the Caribbean and could become tops — with open American travel.\nAmericans accounted for roughly one in six of Cuba’s 3 million visitors last year, mainly Cuban-Americans visiting family. With unrestricted U.S. travel, about 1.5 million more Americans might visit yearly, Cuban officials estimate.\nAlready under new rules this year, visits by Americans without family in Cuba rose 36 percent to 51,458 through May 9, compared with the same time last year, the Associated Press reported.\nCarnival Corp. is angling to be the first to operate cruise service from the U.S. to Cuba in half a century, since Washington imposed its embargo on the communist-led nation.\nThough it awaits Cuban approval, Carnival plans weeklong trips from Miami every other week starting in May on a 710-passenger ship through its new brand called fathom, which specializes in “social-impact travel” such as volunteering and cultural exchange.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:03:36.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
