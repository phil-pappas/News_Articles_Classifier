In its banner year, 1921, the village’s Disappearing Propeller Boat Company produced 355 of these unique 3 horsepower inboard marine motor boats -- making it the largest motor boat builder in the British Empire.\nThe disappearing propeller device for the wooden craft, which was marketed as “The Greatest Little Motor Boat Afloat,” had been originally patented in 1915 by an enterprising local -- W.J. “Young Billy” Johnston.\nOn Saturday Aug. 8, to commemorate the unique boat, about 100 Dippy owners (members of the Dispro Owners Association) will bring their boats to Port Carling and tie up, in a flotilla, near the locks. An all-day open house at the Muskoka Lakes Museum will feature an interactive Dispro device.\nIt is a fitting tribute to a storied boating history. The boats, which cost just $285 in 1916, were perfect for Muskoka lakes and waterways as they often had submerged logs (from the logging industry days), underwater rocks and other unchartered hazards.\n“In those days, too, people liked to go on picnic -- it was a big thing. You could just pull the boat up on shore and have a picnic,” said Paul Dodington, co-author of The Greatest Little Motor Boat Afloat, The Legendary Disappearing Propeller Boat. He lives on Lake Rosseau near Port Carling and has owned and repaired Dippies for years.\nThe housing for the propeller device was designed to fit under one of the mid-ship seats of a locally made, wooden strip rowboat, 16-18 feet long. The propeller was protected from underwater hazards by a hollow articulating bronze skag. The skag was “designed to fold the whole contraption up into the cast-iron housing should it encounter a shoal or deadhead,” according to Dodington’s book.\nThe boat was a breakthrough design because it could go anywhere a canoe went but it had power. By today’s standards, they were slow -- most travelling eight to 11 km per hour although deluxe models could go up to 14 mph. The motors have water-cooled mufflers and make a quiet but distinctive putt-putt-putt sound.\nThe banner years for building the Dippy, or Dispro as it was also known, in Port Carling were 1919 to 1922. Hundreds of the handsome, labour-intensive white oak and cedar or cypress boats with brass fittings were built. Up to 40 men were employed and the Bank of Nova Scotia opened a branch in the village (it’s still the only bank) to handle the payroll. Johnston had sold his interest in the patent to Hodgson in 1916 but stayed as manager of the waterside factory, located close to where the present day locks are. His brick house was built on the hill above and still stands today. Its current owner, Eric Luks, didn’t know the history of the house when he bought it. But he became intrigued with Dippies and eventually bought a 1924 model 8 years ago -- “I paid $5,000 and it was just a pile of grey wood,” he says. It’s been lovingly restored.\nThere’s a simplicity about them that’s endearing, says Dodington, who restored the 1926 boat called Wharerah his Aunt Doodie had when he was a child. His remembers Aunt Doodie taking the Dippy to little hidden shallow coves where they would see wildlife and interesting plant life, like insect-eating Sundews.\nBy the end of 1924, due to financial problems, the Port Carling plant was declared insolvent and closed. But production of the Dippie continued in Lindsay, Ontario and later in Gravenhurst until 1956. In total, about 3,100 Dispros were made.\nIF YOU GO:\nPort Carling is a busy tourist spot in the summer. It straddles the historic locks which opened in 1871, and were rebuilt in 1953. The locks connect the popular Lakes Joseph, Rosseau and Muskoka. Check the phenomenal wall mural which faces part of the locks and depicts a steamship at a distance and close up, a mosaic of early Muskoka photos of people and places. Most people who come up stay at cottages but there are several resorts in the area which can accommodate short-term visitors (such as Shamrock Lodge, Sherwood Inn, Clevelands House). For an overview of accommodation and direct links check www.discovermuskoka.ca . Bala and Bracebridge are close by. Port Carling has a number of walk-to restaurants including: Ellas, Turtle Jacks, Legends, Grand Electric Muskoka and Loondocks. With just two main streets, you can walk the length of “downtown” in10 minutes.\nPrivate paradise in British Columbia", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:42:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
