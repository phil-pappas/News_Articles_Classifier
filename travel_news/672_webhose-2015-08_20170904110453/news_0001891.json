These policies in turn are subject to the rules and regulations of their national aviation regulator,” said Chris Goater, manager of IATA corporate communications, via email to media.\nUzbekistan Airlines says passengers will be weighed on scales in airport departure zones.\nThere are formulas in place issued by aviation bodies like the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency for airlines to calculate the average weight passengers are adding to a plane. Most commonly, that involves applying an average passenger-mass value.\nIn 2012, Samoa Air made global headlines by introducing a pay-as-you-weigh fare structure, which is still in place today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:10:02.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
