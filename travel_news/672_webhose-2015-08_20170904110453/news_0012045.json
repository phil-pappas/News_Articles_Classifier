In total, the Federal Statistical Office recorded more than 34.4 million overnight stays by international visitors in accommodation establishments with ten or more beds during the period of January to June – 1.5 million more than during the same time period in 2014.\nPetra Hedorfer, Chief Executive Officer of the German National Tourist Board (GNTB),\nmade the following statement when these latest numbers were released: “Overall, this result means that we were able to surpass last year’s record numbers. Almost one third of the additional overnights (440,000) were generated by our Asian source markets, an above average increase of 13.2 percent.”\nConsiderable growth in the Top 10 markets\nGermany’s ten most important incoming markets all contributed to the excellent half-year\nresults with solid growth: The Netherlands stay in first place with an increase of 2.3 percent for a total of 4.4 million overnights. Switzerland – assisted by the strong Swiss Franccompared with the Euro – generated 2.8 million overnights, an increase of 9.3 percent. In third, fourth and fifth place are the U.S. (2.5 million overnight, an increase of 5.7 percent), Great Britain (2.4 million overnight, an increase of 7.4 percent) and Italy (1.7 million overnights, an increase of 5.8 percent), which all achieved above average results.\nOverseas markets contribute strongly\nFrom January to June, China contributed more than one million overnights to the German\nincoming statistics, making it the first time ever that the country broke the one million barrier per half-year period, an increase of 26 percent year-over-year. Other countries that contributed to the Asia-Pacific region’s strong performance are India (recording an increase of 11.5 percent), Korea (an increase of 18.6 percent) and Taiwan (an increase of 26.5 percent).\nIn the Americas, Brazil, besides the big source market that is the U.S., is showing some great momentum with 2.5 million arrivals, which comes to an increase of 11.8 percent. The remaining South American countries recorded a total increase of 12.8 percent, whereas Central America and the Caribbean reported an increase of 25.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T14:07:23.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
