Last year, Hong Kong recorded a three per cent growth and a repeat visitation rate of 66 per cent. It’s our 10th largest inbound market. Moreover, the China market surged 22 per cent and rose to become our second biggest market. \n\n“The new campaign helps to raise the profile of our aquatic and coastal assets as people seldom search this information online. Details will be announced when we roll it out in early 2016. For sure, programmes like the great nature walk at Bondi Panorama or Great Ocean Road in the state of Victoria will be included.” \n\nAccording to Tourism Australia's research, tropical islands and beaches are ranked the most important natural environments for Chinese tourists and about 72 per cent of tourism expenditure come from travellers who include an aquatic or coastal activity in their trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T22:48:51.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
