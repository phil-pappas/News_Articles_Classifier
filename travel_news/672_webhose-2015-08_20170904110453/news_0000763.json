Yet the England team who will complete in the Netball World Cup in Sydney from Friday have attracted some eye-catching sponsors. Last week England Netball announced the most lucrative deal in its history, with Vitality becoming the national team’s principal sponsor. The health and life insurer joins a list that includes companies such as Fiat, the car manufacturer, Asics, the sports equipment company, Endsleigh, the insurers, Freya Active, the sports bra brand, and Mrs Crimble’s, the maker of gluten-free foodstuffs. Netball’s commercial revenues are on the rise. Soft-drinks company ZEO paid more than £100,000 last year for a one-year deal to become title sponsors of the Netball Superleague, England’s home international series, and Back to Netball, the initiative that aims to introduce females over the age of 16 to the sport. In 2011, Fiat agreed a deal worth £125,000-£150,000 to become title sponsor of the International Netball Series. So what is the attraction for major multinationals? How does netball help brands to appeal to women and how can sponsoring the sport help brands to increase awareness and affinity as well as engage deeply with customers? For sponsors, netball is a low-cost way for brands looking to appeal to women to build brand awareness The starting point is that the sport is growing in popularity in the UK, with membership of England Netball increasing by 5 per cent to 92,000 last season. There are now 3,000 netball clubs in the country, while more than 60,000 women have taken part in Back to Netball since the scheme began in 2010. Sport England said last year there were 156,000 netballers across the country playing for at least half an hour a week. The sport’s popularity has been aided by England finishing third in the 2011 World Championship in Singapore and winning the 2011 World Series. They are now ranked third in the world. Back to Netball has also emphasised the health benefits of the sport and the 2019 World Cup, to be held in Liverpool, is also expected to cement further gains in its popularity in the UK. For sponsors, netball is seen as a targeted and relatively low-cost way for brands looking to appeal to women to build brand awareness, affinity and loyalty. Free Drinks, ZEO’s parent company, calls netball “one of the most popular team sports in the country, with a successful national team and a thriving grassroots scene”. It credits its sponsorship with helping to promote its message about its low-calorie drinks with zero artificial ingredients to health-conscious women. Fiat Autos UK has praised netball as a “female-dominant sport” that crosses a wide variety of age groups and offers a “huge potential customer database” plus “significant cross-marketing opportunities” in the UK. The company predicted when announcing its sponsorship that netball would fit “perfectly” with models such as the Fiat 500 and Panda that appeal to the sport’s female fanbase, while the larger Fiat Qubo and Doblò models would be well suited to carrying teams to matches. Its sales have benefited during the sponsorship period. During the four years from 2008-2012, Fiat sold 100,000 of its flagship Fiat 500 model in the UK. In 2014 alone, however, it sold 44,000. Netball’s attractions are further heightened by the potential for further growth of the sport, which is seeking to follow the successes achieved by women’s football, rugby and cricket in recent years. Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England, says women’s sport can overcome its low public exposure. “There’s a lack of profile for women’s sports so we’ve got to create an audience and an interest. Although a lot of corporates don’t necessarily get women’s sport, they do get the women’s market. There are huge opportunities in women’s sport.” Quick off the mark Companies such as Fiat and Kia Motors have reaped significant returns by having the foresight and vision to put relatively small amounts of money behind women’s sport. By tapping the first-mover advantage, these companies not only generate exposure for their brand at reasonable prices, but also create loyalty among a group of sporty women who take nothing for granted when it comes to finance or coverage of their success. Yet, these millennial women are part of the next generation of spenders. Exposed to female empowerment since childhood and inspiring campaigns such as #thisgirlcan, their ambitions are high.
