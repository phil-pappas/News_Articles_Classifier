There will be seven men's and four women's heats and the winner from each one competes in the finals. \nLast year there were more than 125 competitors and 12,000 visitors to the festival, host Dairy Farmers of Canada said in a release. \nNed Bell, executive chef of YEW Seafood + Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel in Vancouver , has created seven recipes featuring cheese and will do demonstrations. \nNow in its eighth year, the festival also includes a costume contest and tastings. Kids can take part in uphill races. Reader's comments Â» \nBy adding a comment on the site, you accept our terms and conditions .
