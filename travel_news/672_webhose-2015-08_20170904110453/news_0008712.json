The meaning behind the message is that the most popular bucket list thrill experience on the Las Vegas Strip is about to achieve a major milestone.\nSometime soon, SkyJump Las Vegas, which is a Guinness World Record holder, will host its 200,000th jump – a controlled 855-foot drop from the top of the iconic Stratosphere Tower, 108 floors above the Las Vegas Strip to the landing pad at the base of “SkyJump Las Vegas is unlike any other thrill you can experience in Las Vegas or North America, for that matter,” said Paul Hobson, General Manager of the Stratosphere. “To reach so many jumps in such a short time frame exceeds even our expectations for SkyJump and is a testament to its tremendous popularity. Now the question is, who will be our 200,000th jumper, and when will it happen?”\nSometime soon, Stratosphere will have a 200K Day, in which the 200,000th jumper will receive a grand prize, valued at $2,000 that includes a seven-day cruise to Mexico on Norwegian Cruise Lines, a three-night stay in a Stratosphere Select room, a “Take Vegas Back” package with cocktails and food at Level 107 Lounge and Radius°TM, the new rooftop pool and wet lounge, plus official SkyJump merchandise to commemorate the Stratosphere will also host a 200K Day SkyJump Contest on Facebook, prompting followers to guess the date it will happen. From those who guess the correct date, one will be randomly chosen to win a seven-day cruise to Mexico on Norwegian Cruise Lines.\nCelebration Day Winners: After the 200,000th jumper, all paid jumpers for the remainder of the day will select from a drawing drum, filled with a variety of prizes such as SkyJump discounts, free meals, free slot play, free room stays and more.\nRiders of SkyJump Las Vegas are suited up in a special jumpsuit, then connected to a high-speed “descender” machine. Under the supervision of trained SkyJump personnel, the jumper is escorted to the edge of a small platform where they step out and descend the full 108-story height of the Stratosphere Tower in approximately 17 seconds. Prior to reaching the ground, the “descender” machine slows the jumper down, bringing the jumper to a controlled and safe landing.\nSky Jump Las Vegas officially opened in April 2010 to international fanfare, kicking off a multi-year reimagination of the iconic property.\nSkyJump Las Vegas Hours: Sunday to Thursday, 10am to 1am; Friday and Saturday, SkyJump Las Vegas Packages: $109.99 per jump; $119.99 for jump and photo package; and $139.99 for jump and wristcam video package. Nevada locals and Take Vegas Back Winners must be 21 years or older to redeem prizes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:48:08.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
