With that in mind, having our largest convertible debtholder submit to a lock-up agreement, was also a big move. Stopping any third party sales of this debt, means there will be an absolute reduction in the ongoing dilution that has occurred as a result of this singular noteholder .\"\nWith an imminent beta launch of the Oveedia platform, the Company has endeavored to eliminate the majority of legacy debt [ already decreasing overall debt by approx. $4M ], making way, to properly capitalize the Company in order to grow Latin America's Central American-Caribbean online travel hub.\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners. The Company's vision is to build competitive operations in the areas of (i) online marketing and hotel internet booking engine services, (ii) hotel branding and, (iii) own, operate and in some instances develop, boutique hotels under the new, \"by PURE\" brand.\nRelated Links:\nPure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.
