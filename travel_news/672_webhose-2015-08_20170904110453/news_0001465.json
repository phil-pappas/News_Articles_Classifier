The rapidly growing rental site has around 6000 listings in New Zealand, with the number set to double year on year. \nThere's a lot more to hosting, however, than changing the sheets in your kids' old bedroom and leaving a set of keys in the letterbox. \nHere are six tips for preparing your pad and welcoming strangers into your humble or not-so-humble abode. \nKEEP A COMPETITIVE PRICE \nAirbnb is a handy option if you're going away and want to make some extra cash. How much, exactly? You can figure it out with this handy tool. To make your pad look more appealing, you can even apply for a professional to come shoot it for you . Update your calendar regularly and consider cutting people a good deal for extended stays, as it's easier to manage fewer people coming in and out of your home. \nANTICIPATE GUEST QUESTIONS \nBe as descriptive as you can in the listing. Competition is fierce, so be sure to illustrate the amenities you tick, your decorating style, and what's happening in the neighbourhood, including nearby transport and your favourite spots to brunch, get coffee, and go on dates. Act like the concierge at a hotel. Having brochures and maps are great, but when your guests arrive, make an effort to sit down with them to familiarise them with the postcode. If you're unable to be there for the meet and greet, having a back-up host is a good idea. \nREAD MORE: Ad Feedback \nCREATE A GUEST GUIDEBOOK \nKeep a guide for guests on how to navigate your home. What's the Wi-Fi password, how to use the appliances, what's parking like, where's the meter box located, and most importantly, how to use the remote control. Seriously, why is turning on the TV still so hard wherever you are in the world? And always lead with a handwritten, personally addressed welcome note because first impressions matter. \nCLEAR THE CLUTTER \nA dream temporary rental is minimalist. Guests don't want to see clothes hanging in your closet, just as they don't want to see stray hairs caught in your bathroom comb in the medicine cabinet. Clear the clutter and remove your valuables, keeping them stowed away in a locked room, or your parent's garage. If you keep anything in your junk drawers, rest assured your guests will riffle through them and discover your secret shames. \nGO BEYOND \nWhat can you provide your guests? A stack of clean sheets, shampoo, conditioner, soap, toilet paper, dishwashing detergent and spare towels is standard. (These come in handy if there's ever a flooded bathmat situation, as there always seems to be when using somebody else's shower curtain.) A universal charging dock, bouquet of fresh blooms, deck of playing cards, and scented candle goes beyond. \nSTOCK UP ON PROVISIONS \nYou don't have to get your guests grub, but spending just a tiny bit more at the shops adds that extra layer of comfort and makes a huge difference come review time. Who doesn't love free food? As well as condiments, tea and coffee, the best hosts will load you with provisions such as eggs, milk, bread and cereal. A bottle of wine or six-pack of beers in the fridge is always much appreciated, too. When staying in apartments in Europe, hosts have often greeted me with a box of strudels from the bakery down the street. What's the New Zealand equivalent? We feel a box of sausage rolls from the local bakery would be a solid substitute. \nHave you ever put you home on Airbnb?
