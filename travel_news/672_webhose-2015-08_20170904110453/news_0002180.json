Warren   Show Caption Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Delta Air Lines had a major change of heart about shipping hunting trophies, announcing Monday afternoon that it would no longer accept lion, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo trophies. \nAs recently as May, the Atlanta-based airline had said that it would continue to allow such shipments — as long as they were legal. At the time, some international carriers prohibited such cargo. \nThe move comes after an American dentist killed a well-known lion named Cecil in Zimbabwe last month in an allegedly illegal hunt, setting off a worldwide uproar. The dentist, Walter James Palmer, lives in Minnesota, which is a major hub for Delta. \nDelta is the only U.S. airline to fly to Africa. Several foreign airlines announced similar bans last week. \nDelta would not answer questions from The Associated Press about why the decision was made now and how many hunting trophies it has shipped in recent years. The company only issued a 58-word statement noting that before Monday’s ban, “Delta’s strict acceptance policy called for absolute compliance with all government regulations regarding protected species.” \nHenry Harteveldt, a travel industry consultant, noted that the airline was probably responding to pressure following the news of Cecil’s killing. The airline was the subject of a petition on change.org to ban such shipments. \n“I don’t think there was much of this shipment taking place, so there is minimal revenue loss and big PR gain for them,” he said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:49:42.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
