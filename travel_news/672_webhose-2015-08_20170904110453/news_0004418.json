The humble kite is an unsung hero of man's ingenuity. A piece of fabric and stick that has led to innovations in flight, major scientific breakthroughs and even kept Marco Polo entertained while on his travels - the kite's genius is its simplicity. OK, so flying a kite may not see you dropping a waist size any time soon, but in terms of getting out into the great wide open and connecting with Mother Nature, it's hard to beat. Whether you're inland or by the coast, you don't need a hair-raising gale to enjoy the sublime pleasures of watching your friend bobbing and weaving in the air. There are other benefits to kite flying, too. The pursuit is often cited as a major de-stresser, which attracts many kite enthusiasts with demanding careers. Others love reconnecting to their childhoods, when life was as simple as heading to the local park armed with a homemade kite. Kite flying is often cited as a major de-stresser, which attracts many kite enthusiasts with demanding careers Like many pastimes, the joy of kite flying is better with friends and even better with loads of friends and hundreds of strangers - which is why an organised kite festival has so much appeal. The Bristol International Kite Festival is held every August on Bristol’s Durdham Downs; this year’s free-entry event takes place on August 22 and 23. Even as a spectator, the day is an amazing experience, the sky bursting alive with all sorts of creations. Professional fliers will delight the crowds with their aerial talents, while open flying zones welcome amaetuer fliers to hoist their own kites. If you’re planning to join in and fly a kite in front of an audience, there are a few things you’ll want to know. Here’s how to dip your toe into this emerging sport… 1. Pick the right kite The kite has to match the match the wind conditions. Light and medium winds (6-15 mph) will serve the traditional designs such as the Dragon and the Diamond. If the wind is strong, however (8-25 mph), you might want to go for a Box or stickless Parafoil kite to maintain flight easily. 2. Pick the right day You will want a breeze but you don't want a gale. With a nice breeze, you can make your kite dance and soar, and maybe even loop and trick. A strong gale will have you holding on for dear life, as your beloved tries to escape. Avoid rain and lightning, too. Clouds harness electricity that is attracted to wet kite lines. If you've seen any public service announcements from the Seventies you'll also know to stay clear of power lines; even trees can mess up a day's flying. 3. Lift off! The kite should be facing you with your back to the wind. A friend to help hold the kite is useful. Then unwind about 20 metres (60 feet) of line once it's up. Then it's just a case of pulling and releasing, depending on whether you want the kite to go higher or lower. It's a breeze.
