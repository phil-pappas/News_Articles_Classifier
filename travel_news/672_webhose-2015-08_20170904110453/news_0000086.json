I’m pictured aged nine, with my father, in Weston-super-Mare in 1949. I look virginal, wondering what life’s all about, largely because Dad looked after me a little too much, to compensate for my mother , who wasn’t emotionally available, and was always anxious and had a terrible temper. When I shared my worries with Dad during Sunday evening walks we’d hold hands. I don’t remember holding hands with Mum. I’m sure we did, but she’d say things like, ‘You mustn’t kiss me on the lips, it spreads germs.’ My parents had been married for 13 years when I came along. Mum used to introduce me with the words, ‘This is my son, John. He was an accident .’ Dad was a gentleman in the best sense of the word. I never heard him shout or use bad language, and he was very kind. He was also very intelligent, but he wasn’t an educated man and was terribly lacking in ambition . He happily worked all his life as an insurance agent in Somerset. I don’t really know what Dad did in the First World War. He was made a second lieutenant but he was invalided out with shrapnel injuries. He was a dutiful man and enlisted again as a mere lance-corporal. After the war he had planned to return to his old job, but his commanding officer insisted that he see the Empire, so he found himself on a boat bound for Bombay, where he secured a job as a marine underwriter. He had 14 servants and lived like a prince, sharing a house with PG Wodehouse’s brother. After three years he was transferred to Hong Kong and then Canton, where he visited an opium den, got tattoos and ate a dog (well, he ate a delicious dish that he subsequently discovered was ‘dog’). But he had contracted malaria so he returned to Weston-super-Mare, married Mum and settled into his old insurance job. I was very fond of him, but we grew more distant in later life. My parents didn’t understand my showbiz career and Monty Python mystified them. The Frost Report was the talk of London in the mid-60s, but its absence from television screens in Weston-super-Mare alarmed Dad, who suggested I apply for a more sensible job, in the personnel department of Marks & Spencer. He died in 1972. He smoked 40 a day and had bronchitis and emphysema. In the ambulance he said, ‘Don’t worry, my boy, I’ll be back in a couple of days.’ I said, ‘Oh, I know that, Dad.’ We didn’t really say goodbye because we were both in denial for the other’s sake.
