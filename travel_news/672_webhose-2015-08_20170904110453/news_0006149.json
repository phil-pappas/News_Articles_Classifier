But the perpetrators might be hard to catch – they are squirrels, which have developed a taste for bouquets of flowers. Grieving families are being urged to choose only certain flowers in an attempt to protect their tributes at Earlham Crematorium in Norwich. • Vicar on the run hands himself in The animals have become such a problem that bosses at Dignity, which runs the site, have erected signs warning mourners about the squirrels. They say grey squirrels are particularly partial to eating fresh spray carnations and chrysanthemums because of the high sugar content. Retired postman George Barrett, 67, has filmed the squirrels eating flower heads and wants action to stop them. His daughter, Karlene, died in 2003 and he walks through the crematorium regularly to visit her memorial and pay his respects. Mr Barrett, of Norwich, said: “I have been going in there for 12 years and I have never seen the squirrels eating the funeral flowers until this year. • London's Lost Graveyard, review: the approachable story of Crossrail's skeleton “I’ve seen tributes put down on the Friday morning and by the Friday afternoon they are in pieces because of the squirrels. It’s soul-destroying to see them nibbling away.” He said some of the blooms on his daughter’s memorial, which is in Earlham Cemetery – maintained by the city council – had also been damaged. “I like wildlife, but you have to draw the line somewhere and something has to be done,” said Mr Barrett. A Dignity spokesman said: “We have erected signage informing visitors squirrels live in the area and can sometimes eat fresh spray carnations and chrysanthemums due to their high sugar content. • Chinese baby 'buried for eight days' in graveyard survives “We’ve been advised by Norfolk Wildlife Trust squirrels are less likely to eat other types of flowers and a repellent spray can be purchased which deters them from eating flowers without causing any harm.” He said concerns had been raised with the city council. But Chris Eardley, environmental services development manager at City Hall, ruled out a squirrel cull. Mr Eardley said: “There is no intention of introducing a culling programme in the areas under the council’s control because controlling them in the cemetery, or elsewhere in Norwich, is unlikely to work.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:49:12.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
