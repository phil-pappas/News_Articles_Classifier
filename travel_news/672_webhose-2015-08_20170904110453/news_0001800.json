The day-long workshop started off with a quick round of introductions and a presentation by Jack. The palpable energy and vigour in the room was the perfect backdrop, as the training requires high energy levels and complete control of mind over body. “The real benefit of Metabolic Training is that even if you work out for a shorter amount of time and keep it quick, it helps burn fat and keep muscle tissue lean,” says Jack. \nApart from classic routines like burpees, lunges and high jumps, Metabolic Training can include gymnastic moves, strongman exercises (like flipping tyres), yoga, dance and free play, all done with high speed and accuracy. For instance, one of the sets involved us doing 40 repetitions of step-ups, high jumps and side steps — all under a minute. How’s that for high intensity? \nOne of the most recognised coaches in the world, Jack loves to innovate with “out of the box” workout routines and has created six fitness DVDs on Metabolic Training. The unique method helps maximise calorie burn and increase metabolic rate during and after the workout. \nIt is the hottest fitness trend taking over gyms across the world, according to Jack. In the west, people are replacing a regular gym routine of cardio plus weight training with Metabolic Training. For a city like Mumbai, which is already obsessed with Cross-Fit (a smaller part of Metabolic Training), is it a fad or does it have potential for real results? “It is just a fad if not done properly. One has to be careful with their movements and take time to build the foundation,” he says, adding, “That’s why we ask people to chase quality. The clock will follow.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:02:40.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
