Published on : Saturday, August 1, 2015\nIFEMA has renewed its collaboration with the Association of Nightlife Businesses of the Madrid Region (Asociaci√≥n de Empresarios de Ocio Nocturno), NOCHE MADRID, to organize a new edition of the FESTITUR leisure programme, intended for exhibitors and visitors at the forthcoming FITUR International Tourism Fair, to be held from 20 to 24 January 2016 at FERIA DE MADRID.\nThe success of FESTITUR, launched for the first time during the staging of FITUR 2015 back in January, has prompted the continuation of an initiative which aims to provide professional participants at the Fair with an extensive cultural, leisure and culinary programme during the days of the gathering.\nWith this new, highly ambitious programme, incorporating an extended offering, the aim is to continue a venture devised by the Association of Nightlife Businesses of the Madrid Region, NOCHE MADRID, in order to add greater dynamism to the sector and to promote tourism in the city and region of Madrid. To this end FESTITUR is open to involvement by any type of leisure, show business and hospitality establishment in the Madrid region.\nThrough FESTITUR, FITUR will be helping further to increase the average spend of the professionals attending the forthcoming edition. It should in this regard be emphasised that the figures registered at the last staging of the event, which attracted 222,551 visitors, including 125,084 professionals, from 139 countries, and 9,419 companies from 165 countries, gave the Fair an economic impact in the city of Madrid of more than 200 million euros of induced expenditure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T13:53:32.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
