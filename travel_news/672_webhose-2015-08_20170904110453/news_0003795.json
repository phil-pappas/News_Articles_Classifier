The Department of Agriculture was rededicated as Ministry of Agriculture in August 1947.\nAt present, the Agriculture Ministry under Radha Mohan Singh is mandated to devise schemes to incentivise crop production, including by fixing the minimum support price for more than 20 crops.\nA separate ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution, headed by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan looks after procurement of foodgrains and their supplies through ration shops.\nModi said the government is focusing on raising farm productivity, and providing electricity and irrigation to farmers. He said the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana had been launched with an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore.\n“We need to increase agricultural productivity and we are working in that direction,” he said, adding that focus should be on achieving “per drop, more crop”. The Prime Minister assured farmers that the government would make sufficient availability of fertilisers.\nModi highlighted that the government has allowed 100 per cent production of neem-coated urea to check diversion of this key nutrients to chemical industry and asked farmers to use only neem-coated urea.\nHe said the introduction of “neem-coated urea” has helped to end diversion of subsidised urea to non-agricultural purposes.\nModi said the government is reviving closed urea plants, including those in eastern parts of India.\nTo boost the farm sector, the government has already announced plans to spend Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) to improve farm productivity.\nCurrently, 142 million hectares are used for cultivation, of which only 45 per cent farm land is under irrigation.\nThat apart, a Soil Health Card scheme has been launched under which the Centre plans to target over 14 crore farmers in the next three years to check the excess use of fertilisers.\nIndia’s foodgrain production is estimated to have declined by 5.25 per cent to 251.12 million tonnes in 2014â€”15 crop year against record 265.04 million tonnes in the previous year.\n 15, 2015 1:29 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:04:17.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
