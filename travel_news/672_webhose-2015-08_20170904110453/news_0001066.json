The company said its last flights to Israel will be on January 4 from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv and January 5 for the return flight.\nAmerican Airlines has a less than spectacular history with Israel. Many years ago it bought TWA, which went bankrupt, and American entered legal proceedings concerning compensation for company employees, a process that lasted many years.\nAmercian Airlines at Ben Gurion Airport (Photo: American Airlines)\nSix years ago US Airways began flying from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv and carried out a daily flight between those cities. Last year US Airways and American Airlines merged and kept the American moniker.\nThe new company, now one of the largest in the world, operated flights to Israel and said it was considering an expansion of its operations between Israel and the United States. The announcement of the closure of the route surprised the Israeli branch's employees and its customers.\nThe company said it contacted customers who made reservations and purchased tickets after the last flight date to find solutions for them or to reimburse them. American Airlines has 19 employees in Israel and they will all be terminated the day the route is closed.\nIn the first nine months of the year, American Airlines flew about 95 thousand passengers on the Philadelphia-Tel Aviv route and about 95,000 passengers, a 2.74 percent increase compared to last year.\n Tweet", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ynetnews/129653250402500?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/share", "http://twitter.com/#!/ynetnews", "http://images1.ynet.co.il/PicServer4/2014/10/29/5664262/566424901001557640360no.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js"], "published": "2015-08-22T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T06:07:10.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
