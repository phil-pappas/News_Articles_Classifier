In New York. Or so close it doesn’t matter. By Stephen Milioti & Amelie Gillette Published The Hyatt Regency in Jersey City. (Photo: Coutesy of Hyatt Regency) \nI n many cities besides New York, $250 gets you a nice room at a good hotel, with shampoo, a shower cap, and maybe even an in-room coffeepot. In New York, not so much. But with some digging and some deals, it is possible to find a clean room, a soft mattress, free internet, and fresh-baked cookies for two and a half Franklins. Note: Prices can vary widely (especially in the fall and spring high seasons) and often go up during the week. \n2 Exchange Pl., Jersey City, N.J.; 201-469-1234 Price: $199 Pros: Great views The best $200 hotel in New York is in New Jerseya one-stop, four-minute PATH ride or short Water Taxi ride from lower Manhattan. My room has water and city views (not all do, but the ultranice front-desk agent upgraded me because there was available space). The room is 400 feet, with low-key and sophisticated touches: a granite bathroom sink; a rather masculine taupe, brown, and gray color scheme; a good-size desk for working; and very upscale beddingplus a spectacular view of the Woolworth Building.

It’s a quirky and inexpensive boutique hotel carved from two historical townhouses separated by a charming, internal courtyard in the middle of the area’s flashing lights, high-rises, and truly pricey hotels. \n4 W. 31st  268-2900 Price: $185 Pros: Location, location, location Once the turn-of-the-century stamping ground of writer Edith Wharton, the 165-room hotel is now a favorite budget option for visiting Midwesterners, European backpackers, and anyone else who steps into the grand, gilded lobby. Though prices are relatively low and the amenities modern, the sophisticated Old New York feel remains intact. One almost expects to see John Astor himself glide into the expansive front room to eat his fill of the free muffins and coffee set out each morning.

Third Ave.; 212-475-2845 Price: $131 Pros: Gritty glamour The setting for Woody Allen’s 1993 Manhattan Murder Mystery, this is one of the most love-them-or-hate-thems of the bunch. The lobby is teeny, and the rooms, all decorated differently, are in a time warp. Mine has shiny prints, slight wallpaper peels, and dark-wood furnishings that are very Addams Family . The bedding is reasonably clean but flimsy, with a thin comforter. There are both shared and private bathrooms, and basically no services, but given the hotel’s shockingly affordable standard-room rate in low season, ordering in from Joe Jr.’s on Third Avenue isn’t such a hassle. \n2178 Broadway, at 77th St.; 212-362-1100 Price: $189 Pros: Big rooms A cozy, brick-walled candlelit lobby boasts dark leather sofas and a sleek industrial-style bar with an outdoor area. Rooms have a similar aesthetic, but they’re well apportioned; mine is a good size, with a clearly delineated seating area, a wing chair, and a separate area for a desk. The bathroom is tiny, but at least you’re not in midtown. (Photo: Courtesy of Pod Hotel) \n230 E. 51st St., nr. Second Ave.; 212-355-0300 Price: $115 Pros: Mod décor This hotel, formerly the cheap, chintzy Pickwick Arms, became the cheap, cool Pod. Rates start at $115, and just over half the rooms have private baths. The aesthetic is standard spare modern: light wood and bright-colored red or blue comforters. My room, measuring about 12-by-8 feet, has a bed connected to two side tables, a tiny work desk, small closet nook, and flat-screen TV. There’s a new-paint-over-old feeling, though; the elevators are rickety, the walls are thin, and the mattresses are hard. For $130, the room with bath is well worth the $15 upgrade from a shared-bath pod. \n59  719-2300 Price: $140 Pros: Additional facilities like a business room and fitness center The former Super 8 was renamed in 2008, but no matter the moniker, its location in what's left of Little Brazil puts it within walking distance of Broadway shows and Rockefeller Center and thus makes it popular with European backpackers and budget travelers.
