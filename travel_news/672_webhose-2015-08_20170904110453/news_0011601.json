The company was awarded the tender in 2013 ahead of nine other companies.\nLast week, Geingob officially opened the Ruacana-Omakange Road in the northwestern part of the country which was also built by a Chinese company — China Machinery Engineering Corporation — and funded by the Export Import Bank of China to the tune of 420 million Namibian dollars.\nAddressing the gathering Friday, Geingob said he expected that the new terminal and runway to establish a new benchmark of functional efficiency and operational safety for airports in the country.\n“It also exemplifies our intent as a nation to build world-class infrastructure. I have no doubt that this terminal will fulfill the expectations we have from it and make us all feel very proud,” he said.\nWhile thanking Qingdao Construction Company for a world class job, Geingob said the government of Namibia could not go it alone when it came to infrastructure development.\n“The private sector must pull its weight in joining our drive for improved infrastructure since it stands to benefit from this, just like the rest of the country,” he added.\nHe further said Namibia’s infrastructure needs were enormous and that a deficit in infrastructure was a serious constraint to the country’s ambitions as it would limit the pace of economic growth.\n“We therefore need to apply extra effort to bridge any existing infrastructure deficit so that we are able to catapult ourselves to the head of the queue, not only as a logistics hub, but as the preferred destination for investment and tourism in the region and in Africa as a whole,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T02:47:30.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
