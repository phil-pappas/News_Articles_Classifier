Chicago and cities throughout the country are transforming hulking pieces of obsolete infrastructure into useful — even inspiring — amenities: In this case, a park in the sky that doubles as an alternative transportation corridor.\nSince opening in June, the nearly 3-mile elevated path called the Bloomingdale Trail has changed how residents move through a section of Chicago’s northwest side that in many places is starved of parks and inviting pathways for pedestrians and bikes.\n“This trail opened up a lot of opportunity for me,” said Luke Young, a 30-year-old Web developer who now bikes the 10 miles to his job downtown instead of taking the train; it takes roughly the same time. Moving by bike, though, is more fun and a way to relieve stress, he said before tearing down a ramp that links the trail to Milwaukee Avenue, a busy thoroughfare popular with cyclists.\nAfter decades of decline, American cities are getting creative in rolling out new green spaces to sell their brands.\nElevated rail lines especially have beckoned, tapping into utopian visions of parks and pathways in the sky. There’s Manhattan’s High Line and Paris’ Promenade Plantée. But the Bloomingdale Trail pushes into new territory: It’s longer, allows bikes and links a string of ground-level parks. The park and trail system is known collectively as The 606 — a reference to the first three digits of the city’s ZIP codes.\nIts linear shape extends access to a huge number of people across four neighborhoods. The 17-foot-high rail embankment, once a physical dividing line, is now a connector and a gathering place for communities as diverse as Humboldt Park, the center of the Puerto Rican community, and Bucktown, a recently gentrified neighborhood that’s home to cool cafes and doggy day-care centers.\nOn a hot August morning, bikers shot up and down The 606, office IDs fluttering, GoPro cameras mounted to helmets, earbuds piping in the tunes. In the glow of sunrise, joggers and moms with strollers glided along a narrow, rubbery strip along either side. An older man buzzed by in an electric wheelchair.\nDina Petrakis, a 57-year-old remodeling consultant, biked with her tiny dog, Lucy, poking its head out of a shoulder satchel. Petrakis mainly uses the trail to get to yoga class.\n“I used to have to drive because you can’t really ride your bike over there. Streets are too busy,” she said.\nDesigners carved pleasing dips and curves into the path. Short gravel side loops take walkers into shady tree-filled groves. The embankment widens in places into spacious overlooks. The western trailhead includes a spiraling earthwork in the design of an ancient solar observatory, and there are plans for a skate park and art installations.\nThe safety of the trail got Jim Trainor back on the bike that he’d ditched after his wife got hit by a car door while cycling. Now, the 54-year-old professor of animation at the Art Institute of Chicago rides every morning for exercise and serenity.\n“It’s kind of a godsend for me,” he said.\nThe Associated Press\nWhen you go Find out more about the Bloomingdale Trail and the parks at the606.org .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T09:25:50.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
