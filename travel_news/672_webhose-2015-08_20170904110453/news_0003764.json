For the current generation of cocooned teenagers, the cost of bus fares or toilet roll is most likely a mystery far deeper than the origins of the universe. But if your child is to avoid “Fresher’s Syndrome” – partying every night at the beginning of term, barely able to afford the rail fare home at Christmas – they need to understand the basics of financial planning. And with a little help from you, they could be well on their way to being savvy spenders by the time you drop them off on their first day. It’s time to draw up a budget – and apps are a very good place to start. There are plenty of free ones offering budgeting at the touch of a button, but one of the easiest to use is Spendometer (free on iPhone and Android), which allows the user to set a daily, weeklyor monthly budget, and then gives them a breakdown of any overspending if they end up exceeding it. It's easy to forget budgeting in Fresher's week madness Photo: Alamy Alternatively, why not reintroduce your child to the concept of pen and paper and take them through some simple money in versus money out calculations? When you’re drawing up a budget for the first time, it’s easy to be lulled into a false sense of security. Your child may feel dizzy at the sheer amount of cash available to them once the tuition fees are paid, but it’s important to stress from the outset that the interest-free overdraft they will ideally have should really be for emergencies. Having totted up the loans, holiday-job earnings and any money that you’regiving them, it’s time to move on to the biggest outlay of all: accommodation. London halls can cost well over £150 a week, plus an initial deposit, and more like £110 to £130 if you’re outside the capital. And while a place in a student residence will include all bills (including internet), the private rentals most students opt for in the second year won’t. Many Freshers will have car-running expenses to factor in, and then there are mobile phone bills, books and equipment for their course, laundry costs, insurance and household essentials. It can all really start to add up – and that’s just during term time. “Student loans are designed to last for a full calendar year, and people need to think about how they’re going to fund the summer holidays,” warns Katie Urnevitch, student money adviser at the University of Manchester. “They need to bear in mind, too, that they’ll probably have to pay the deposit for next year’s accommodation before they receive this year’s back.\" Most students are not used to managing such amounts Photo: Alamy Food is another thing you should be encouraging them to think about before they head off for their first term.The average student, research suggests, spends between £30 and £40 a week on meals. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s perfectly possible to eat cheaply without living off cereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner, or having to be sent emergency food parcels from home. Even if you’re a totally unrepentant supermarket snob, your child really can’t afford to be now that they’re fending for themselves. By opting for value and own-brand lines, ferreting bargains and buying in bulk, they’ll be able to save a small fortune. Travelling to and from lectures and back home to see the family can be pricey, but many universities offer subsidised travel to and from the campus. For longer trips, a 16-25 Railcard at a modest £30 for one year (£70 for three) is a must. Once your youngster has deducted all of these key outgoings, they’ll be left with their disposable income. It’s not exceeding this figure that separates the persistent shopaholic living beyond their means from the canny scrimper and saver. Of course, you’re anxious for them to be able to make the most of everything that university has to offer – and more often than not, that involves parting with some cash. You wouldn’t want them staying in on their own every night for fear of emptying the piggy-bank. The key to budgeting, as with so many things in life, is getting the balance right. • Step-by-step guide to A-level Results Day • Step-by-step guide to Clearing • Step-by-step guide to Adjustment • Download the Telegraph's Clearing app for iPhone and Android @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T11:49:03.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
