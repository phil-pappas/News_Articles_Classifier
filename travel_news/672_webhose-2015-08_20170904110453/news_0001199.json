It may be cold outside ... But it’s heating up in here! #bestfriends #friends #mistletoe #party #kiss #bff #imnext #betterment #rtr’. Photo: @imnotathirdwheel. Source: Instagram\nAnd he doesn’t mind a bit.\n“A lot of people look at it like, ‘I have to tag along’; I look at it like, ‘I can’t wait to go out with my best friends,’ ” says Alden, who’s single and looking. “If anything, it’s more [about] changing your mindset about the situation.”\nHe first created the account to give friends and family a laugh, but it’s helped change the concept of third wheelin’ from a burden to a bonus.\nHere, Alden shares his tips on how to take the awkward out of the odd number.\n‘We had the #best #day #ever at the #beach! #threesome #tripod #beach #nantucket #threesacharm #bestfriends #dontforgetme #heyy #brother #renttherunway #rtr’. Photo: @imnotathirdwheel. Source: Instagram\nPick the right activity\n“I’d probably stay away from restaurants that have candles,” Alden says. He first third-wheeled with Ben and Marissa over brunch, his go-to three-person outing.\n“There’s no pressure, it’s not like they’re itching to get back home.”\nOutdoor activities also keep things moving and provide a chance for conversation.\nBe confident the couple wants you there\nIt’s easy to feel like an unwanted tagalong, but couples actually profit from having a Luigi to their Mario and Princess Peach. “It can mix things up a little bit in a nice way,” Alden says.\n“They know everything about each other. I live vicariously through them as a couple, and they live vicariously through me as a single guy finding his way through New York’s dating scene.”\n‘A cold #aspen night with my #besties! Hope you are all keeping #warm this #holidayseason! #bestfriends #tripod #blessed #fireplace #threesome #friends #rtr #betterment #winter #family #skiing #powpow #redmountain #mcm #love #shredthegnar’.
