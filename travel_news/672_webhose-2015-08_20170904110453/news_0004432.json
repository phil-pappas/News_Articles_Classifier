Sophie Griffiths asked the new president what he’s planning next for the line \nHe may have been the ﻿boss of Norwegian Cruise Line for just four months, but Andy Stuart is already making an impact. Since he took the helm as the line’s new president and chief operating officer after the departure of Kevin Sheehan, Stuart has altered the line’s pricing policy, seen the line’s UK office relocate from London to Southampton and this week announced the relocation of Norwegian Star to Asia and Australia - a significant move for a line that was previously based only in the US and Europe. \nIt’s not a bad start for a man who has only been in the role since March. But Stuart is not your average new boss - this year marks his 27th with Norwegian Cruise Line, since starting out as UK business development manager in 1988. \nAlso a refreshing change is Stuart’s frankness when answering questions, no matter how controversial - including those on the relocation of the company’s UK headquarters from London to Southampton, which was completed last month. \n“We lost a fair few people that we would have liked to have retained,” he sighs. “But people have lives, and we understand that. \n“The lease in London was expiring, and London rent is expensive. Even without the acquisition of Prestige, we would have been evaluating our office location, but given that we had just acquired Prestige, the obvious thing was to merge the offices and look at Southampton, where Prestige is based.” Push for recruitment \nThe firm is now on a major recruitment drive, although Stuart says “the vast majority of the senior team have remained”. \nEven though Norwegian now shares the office campus with its new sister brand Prestige, Stuart insists the two firms will remain distinct but admits there are “still things we can learn from each other”. \n“There are three brands in three completely different segments. There are separate sales teams for each one and that will remain - that is sacrosanct. [Prestige] does things differently, but one of the beautiful things of the acquisition means we can share our knowledge. Norwegian is good at digital marketing and Prestige does less of that, but they are good at direct marketing.” \nIt is the latter expertise Stuart admits he is keen to learn from Prestige, largely because he is planning a significant marketing push for Norwegian in the UK starting this year. \n“Most marketing has been to travel agents up to now, and it’s been up to them to then tell their customers. We want to do a better job of marketing to the consumer,” he says. \nAgents fearful that this could mean a bid to boost its direct business should not be concerned however. “This is good news for agents,” he says. “We won’t do anything that doesn’t have ‘contact your travel agent on’. The vast majority of our business still comes through the trade - more than 90% is from agents and we absolutely don’t see that changing.” \nIn terms of what form this advertising will take, Stuart says TV is unlikely, at least for now. \n“We wouldn’t rule out digital advertising and direct mail, though,” he adds. “We’ll be taking some of the learnings from Prestige, which does this very well. We’ll also look at newspaper advertising in those titles it makes sense for.” \nThe plan to boost the line’s presence in the UK coincides with the launch of its latest ship, Norwegian Escape, currently being completed in the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany, where I meet Stuart. \nThe ship is part of the “Breakaway plus” class - not quite a sister ship to Breakaway and Getaway, more of a first cousin - or as Stuart describes it, “an evolution”. \nWhere Breakaway and Getaway has one plank - a two-metre walkway that extends out from the ship over the ocean - Escape has two. Its waterslides are also more diverse, including a two-person rafting chute. Meanwhile, the Haven - the line’s suite-class offering - is 50% bigger on Escape than any of Norwegian’s other ships, with 92 staterooms. Launch party \nOne significant similarity, though, is the way Norwegian will celebrate the launch of Escape - with some 300 agents invited onboard, along with their customers, in the same way that Norwegian introduced Getaway. \nEscape will be showcased to the UK trade in October after an event in Hamburg for European agents. “It was a real success when we did the same [with agents’ customers] on Getaway,” Stuart says. “It’s a great opportunity to show the ship to agents and their customers, and last time it introduced a lot of first-timers to Norwegian. \n“It’s a great loyalty move for agents to be able to offer this to their customers, and we sold a lot of cruises off the back of it. We felt the mix of agents and customers was a good opportunity to spread the word among consumers.” \nIt is easy to see why Stuart might be so keen to spread the word among consumers, with most industry experts confessing that the market has been slightly slower this year. Stuart concedes: “The UK has been a little challenging. There is a lot of capacity and it’s very competitive, but the freestyle concept has been embraced. \n“Customers know the value that they get with us, and agents have done a good job at picking the choice that is most appropriate to their customer - for example, whether they would prefer a beverage package. \n“That’s one of the challenges for agents - presenting the value of a cruise to their customers,” he adds. “There has always been a big focus on price, price, price - agents need to shift away from that.” \nStuart is also adamant that the line is committed to avoiding the discounting route. But what if that means that ships may have to sail half empty? \n“We’ll get the price right early in the booking process to make sure that doesn’t happen,” he counters. \n“It’s everyone’s goal, but we’re absolutely not going to go down that path [discounting]. Price isn’t irrelevant - it’s just not the thing you should lead in with. If you establish the right price at the beginning, you can learn through the curve if it’s the right price. \n“If you start selling 18 months before the ship sails, then you know by 15 months if this price is working and if it is selling. You shouldn’t be waiting until the last minute to realise this.” \nAndy’s favourite cruise \n﻿Andy Stuart on his favourite cruise and why he won’t be joining the walking dead in January \n“The best cruise I ever took was to Alaska on the Norwegian Pearl. We took the whole family - kids and grandparents. It converted my mum to cruise. \nI hadn’t been that fussed about cruising to Alaska, but it was absolutely incredible. \n“The cruise I wish I could do, though, is a special Walking Dead-themed sailing in January - also on the Norwegian Pearl. The main characters are going to be onboard - and there’ll be Q&As with them, and screenings. I couldn’t get on it, though - we had more than 14,000 people register for it. It sold out in seven days, and we now have a waiting list of 500 people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:01:22.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
