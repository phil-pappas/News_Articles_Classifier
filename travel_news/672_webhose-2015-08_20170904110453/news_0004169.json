The National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) is grateful to Hilton for its decision to no longer seek profits from hardcore pornography, which by nature facilitates sexual exploitation. \n\"We want to publicly thank Hilton for its decision to create a safe and positive environment for all of its customers,\" said Dawn Hawkins, Executive Director of NCOSE. \"Hilton has taken a stand against sexual exploitation. Pornography not only contributes to the demand for sex trafficking, which is a serious concern in hotels, but it also contributes to child exploitation, sexual violence, and lifelong porn addictions. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation applauds Hilton Hotels for recognizing these harms, and is glad to announce that Hilton Hotels will be removed from the Dirty Dozen List.\" \nHilton Hotels had previously been listed on NCOSE's Dirty Dozen List, which names twelve mainstream organizations contributing to sexual exploitation.
