More than 1 million cases have been reported across the country. There is no vaccine to prevent the mosquito-born disease, but travelers can reduce risk of infection by using protection against insect bites. Symptoms can include fever; headache; eye, joint and muscle pain; and nausea. \nChina: Explosions at chemical plants in the port city of Tianjin, just 90 miles from Beijing, have caused concern about environmental safety, as sodium cyanide may release poisonous hydrogen cyanide into the air. Authorities are monitoring levels of air and water pollution in hopes of preventing additional chemical contamination. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing urges visitors to follow guidelines set by local authorities and avoid the blast area until given further information. \nJapan: A new tourist guide has been released in Kyoto, outlining several tips on how to avoid cultural offenses while visiting the popular tourist city. One of the worst cultural offenses, according to the guide, is riding bicycles while under the influence of alcohol, which can result in fines up to $8,000 or five years in prison. Other offenses include parking bikes outside designated areas, littering, smoking outside designated areas, photographing the inside of certain shrines and temples, and tipping. Tourists also are advised to use caution while taking selfies near trains. \nSouth Africa: Tourists should be aware of a bribing scam conducted by police, particularly near Kruger National Park, along the Garden Route and on the N4 highway to Mozambique. At least 15 reports of police officials taking bribes from tourists have been reported. Those targeted tend to be in rental cars that the police pull over for alleged violations and then demand that fees be paid immediately to avoid arrest. Reports say that Ekurhuleni Metro Police are the primary suspects in the scam. \nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
