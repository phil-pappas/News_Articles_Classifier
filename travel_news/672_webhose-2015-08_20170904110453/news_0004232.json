There is nothing so vulgar as a hotel sign outside: just a few flags.\n Taking on the 'Heidi hike': Trekking from hut to hut is an... New York's autumn collection: Why you SHOULD visit the city... When the journey really IS the best part: The scenic roads... Rare photographs show the fascinating early days of London's... Its proud boast that ‘the only thing overlooked is the White House’ is borne out as we reach our room – we have a prime view of Chez Obama.\nEven if it’s unlikely that the famously abstemious Obama will pop in, maybe one of the bar’s regulars, the President’s former spin doctor David Axelrod, will turn up.\nPerhaps Axelrod, who advised Ed Miliband in the run-up to our Election in May, will tell me (off the record, of course) what he really thought of Red Ed’s ludicrous ‘Edstone’ and where it is hidden.\nUnbeknown to me, my partner Jenni – more interested in shops than political stories – has just got closer to the Obamas than I have.\nThe hotel’s Off The Record bar. The Obamas lived at the Hay-Adams hotel for a fortnight before Barack's inauguration\nAs I reel off my failed endeavours, she casually reveals that she saw Obama’s daughter Malia just a couple of blocks from the hotel.\nI intensify my research – in other words, it’s back to Off The Record for another drink.\nAny politicos in tonight, I ask David the barman? ‘No.’\nAny well-known Brits been in lately? ‘Yeah, Charles and Camilla a few weeks back – oh, and Tony Blair.’ Impressive.\nBy the third day of our stay, I am giving up hope of tracking down a Watergate-style scoop. Back to Off The Record.\n‘Don’t tell me,’ I say to David. ‘No politicos.’\n‘Actually, you missed Axelrod by two minutes,’ he drawls. ‘He was with Robert Gibbs [Obama’s former press secretary]. Axelrod had two Heinekens, Gibbs one.’\nThe ‘hold the front page’ moment I could have teased out of Axelrod flashes by.\nThe president’s daughter Malia, who was seen a couple of block away from the hotel during Walters' visit\nI slink away, defeated, and we take the train to New York for two days at the Lowell Hotel, perfectly placed between Central Park and the boutiques of Madison and Fifth Avenues.\nI can go for long walks in Central Park brooding over Axelrod while Jenni browses in Bloomingdale’s.\nWhen I catch up with her for a coffee, I am relieved to see that she is not loaded down with bags from Jimmy Choo.\nCompared to the Hay-Adams, the Lowell’s lobby is tiny, but it compensates with subtle and stylish fabrics, and the most athletic bellhop in Manhattan.\nWhen we needed a cab to catch our BA flight home, he sprinted four blocks to flag one down.\nWe leave the US empty-handed but luxuriating in the memory of the heavenly Hay-Adams and the lovely Lowell. Who needs scoops? Or Choos for that matter.\nTravel Facts: Plan your own trip to Washington DC British Airways flies 11 times a day between Heathrow and New York (from £340), and three times a day between Heathrow and Washington DC (from £621).\nA Superior Room at the Hay-Adams in Washington starts at £249 per night.
