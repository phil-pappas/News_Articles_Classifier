Against 11 lakh tourists who visited Kashmir for the same period last year, only 4.5 lakh tourists were hosted by the Valley this year, a slide of more than 50 percent. \nTo pull up numbers, Mufti asked the tourism department to take a leaf out of Rajasthan’s initiatives, which has seen them convert grandeur of its palaces, castles and forts into prime objects of heritage sightseeing. \n\"The state needs to similarly project its shrines and pilgrim destinations on a much larger canvas. I was at Ajmer Sharief recently and I saw a number of devotees from my state there in large numbers paying obeisance at the holy shrine,” he said. \nThe state is closely working with Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in mapping state’s heritage properties. The aim is to involve local stakeholders in reviving their old villas as heritage cottages, cafes, museums and cultural centres so that they become productive assets. \nDescribing various cultures of the state as its greatest binding force, the chief minister said J&K is safe because of its multiculturalism and rich hospitality. “We have won hearts of the people because of the love and affection we have showered upon them,” he said. \nReferring to the rich influence of Central Asian countries on the state’s handicraft and cuisines, the chief minister complimented people for sustaining the rare arts for such a long time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:14.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
