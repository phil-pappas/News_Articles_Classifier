The American Hotel & Lodging Association on Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015 issued a statement announcing its opposition to the proposed combination of travel booking sites Expedia and Orbitz, saying that the deal would mean higher prices for vacationers and larger fees for hotel owners. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) \nExpedia early this year said it would buy Orbitz for $1.3 billion. It had hoped to complete the acquisition in the second half of this year, but the proposed buyout is still under review by the Justice Department.\nThe hotel trade group said Thursday that the deal would \"severely reduce consumer choice.\" It also noted that Expedia charges hotels, on average, 11 per cent higher commissions than Orbitz.\nMany smaller, independent hotels rely on these sites to attract travellers who otherwise would not have heard of their properties.\nIf the buyout goes through Expedia and competitor The Priceline Group Inc. will control 95 per cent of the online travel agency bookings in the U.S., according to the hotel trade group. Priceline owns sites such as Booking.com and Kayak.\nExpedia declined to comment on the pushback from the hotel industry Thursday.\nExpedia and Orbitz own several websites that allow travellers to book airline tickets, hotel rooms or car rentals. Orbitz Worldwide Inc., based in Chicago, owns HotelClub.com, Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com. Expedia Inc., based in Bellevue, Washington, owns Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Check Tickets, Trivago and Hotwire.com.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:16:06.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
