One of the six employees performed safety-sensitive work although Leading Edge never received a verified negative pre-employment drug test for him, the agency alleges.\nFinally, the FAA alleges the company used DOT forms to document non-DOT drug tests for three employees and used a non-DOT form to document urine collection for another employee.\nLeading Edge has been in communication with the FAA about the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:00:10.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
