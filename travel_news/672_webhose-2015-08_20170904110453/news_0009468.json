More Packer to step down as Crown chairman \n“The Peter May and Tony Lock stands, which are coming down [to be replaced by the new stand] are 30 to 40 years old. They are pretty tired with no toilets, no bar and no catering,” he said. \n“The new stand will have 1,300 extra seats and a roof garden, which will be a pleasant place to watch cricket. It will also be shaded by a ‘living’ wall [of plants] on the outside so it is very eco-friendly.” \nSurrey’s members were able to apply for between £2,000 and £250,000 of the bond on Monday, with the rest of the allocation open to the public next week. The bond carries a cash coupon of 5.5 per cent. \n“We sent out an email to our 10,000 members last week and we have had 1,000 expressions of interest already, so a great response,” said Mr Gould. \n“We wanted to do a mini bond because we are owned by our members and this is a way of involving them. We are not offering any sweeteners; we want to be clear about the financial benefits,” he added. \nSurrey is also raising a further £6.5m in bank loans to build the new stand. The club said that its revenues had risen healthily in recent years, with £3m of income from T20 matches and £4m of revenues last year from conferencing and events. \n“We have been around since 1845 and our financial position is extremely solid. We have a great deal of confidence in our ability to repay,” said Mr Gould. \nHe said that the construction would begin at the end of the season and was expected to be finished by next May. “It is a tight schedule,” he said. \nMini bonds have become popular among sports businesses since the Jockey Club raised £25m to finance a new stand at Cheltenham in 2013 and Lancashire County Cricket Club raised £3m last November. Wasps rugby club, meanwhile, sold out a £35m retail bond, secured on their stadium, in a few days earlier this year. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
