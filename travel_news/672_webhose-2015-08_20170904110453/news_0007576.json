It was the nation’s biggest devaluation in two decades.\nThe sudden paper gains propelled the ESG hedge fund to a roughly 50% year-to-date return through mid-August, after fees. The surge also helped the fund recover from losses earlier in the year. Through the end of July, it had lost 11%, one of the people said.\nChina has become an increasingly popular target for short bets that asset values will deteriorate. But limited foreign access to the country’s equity and bond markets means there aren’t many ways to bet on outright declines in those markets, and the methods that do exist tend to be small and illiquid.\nNexus, led by former fixed-income salesman Brian McCarthy, instead focused on betting against China’s currency. The fund purchased a string of put options that gave it the right to sell the currency at preset prices, within agreed-upon time frames.
