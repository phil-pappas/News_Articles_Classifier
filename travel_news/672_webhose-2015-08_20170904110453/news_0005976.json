It may be difficult, but for those determined to make it in this year, there are still some ways onto a course, for both the postgraduate and undergraduate routes. And if that doesn’t work out, now is the ideal time to get to grips with the application processes for the various forms of teacher training you can choose between. For 2016 entry, Ucas Teacher Training applications (for postgraduate routes) open in late October, and the main Ucas application system (for undergraduate routes) opens on the 1st of September. You need to have a degree to become a teacher in England, although there are many teacher training options that incorporate a degree, which are open to non-graduates who meet the other requirements. Useful websites: • Ucas Teacher Training • Department for Education - Get Into Teaching • Teach First • Prospects The two application systems: • Ucas Teacher Training - This is the dedicated application system for postgraduate routes into teacher training, including university, college and school-led training. These range from the Postgradate Certificate in Education (PGCE) to School Centred Initial Teacher Training (SCITT); a full breakdown of the different routes can be found here . In general, the majority of postgraduate options lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), which is required for work in most schools, although not in the independent sector. • Regular Ucas application system - This is the place to apply for undergraduate teaching routes, and is exactly the same as applying for a regular degree course, although there may still be additional requirements for experience or other elements that will need to be considered. The two ways you can still get onto a course for 2015 entry: 1. You can still apply to a postgraduate teacher training programme through Ucas Teacher Training Although it is very late in the cycle, and so most places will be filled, applications are still open for postgraduate routes. Ucas Teacher Training is a separate system to the regular Ucas application method, and is split into Apply One and Apply Two, which will not be part of Ucas Clearing . This video from Ucas takes you through the process in more detail, but here are some of the key points. In Apply One you can make up to three choices, which can be for any course route, subject or age group, in any combination. The Apply One cycle for 2015 entry ends on the 15th of September. You use the same personal statement for all three of the applications, regardless of their different composition. You could find yourself in front of a class sooner than you think Photo: Alamy Programmes open and close at different times depending on the provider’s plans, and you should expect it to be tough to find a place this late in the day, although it is possible. Applicants will need to make sure they can fulfil the requirements, such as holding an undergraduate degree awarded by a UK higher education provider, meeting GCSE requirements and passing the professional skills test. Additionally, applicants require two weeks’ classroom experience and will need to fulfil the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) requirements (which replaced the Criminal Records Bureau). Two references are also required, which will need to be completed before the application can be submitted. These cannot be by family members or friends, and if you’re still at university or recently got your degree, one reference must be from someone at your university. The other should be someone who knows you from work and can comment on your potential as a teacher. If all three of your Apply One choices do not accept you, you can then use Apply Two, which lets you apply to one choice at a time, although time will become a limiting factor this late in the day. The Apply Two cycle for 2015 entry ends on the 9th of October. Bear in mind that if you have to wait for 2016 entry, applications typically open in late October, so now is the perfect time to make sure you can fulfill all the requirements. 2. You can find an undergraduate teaching degree through Clearing Undergraduate teaching degrees are part of the main Ucas undergraduate admissions scheme, meaning that courses may appear in Clearing next week. The undergraduate routes into teaching tend to focus on primary education, and take the form of a three year BA or four year B.Ed course. There are some secondary options available, so make sure you explore the full breadth of what is out there. An undergraduate teaching degree is one of the options available Photo: Alamy You will need to be prepared to enter Clearing, and if you expect to be doing so, you should start calling universities now to explore where places are likely to be available. Our Clearing guide has everything you need to know for this process, although bear in mind there will still be additional requirements for undergraduate teaching courses that you will need to consider. For instance, for the BA Primary Education with QTS at the University of Greenwich, applicants will need 300 Ucas points, be able to provide recent evidence of work or observation experience in a primary school class, and pass pre-entry national skills test in numeracy and literacy. A DBS check and occupational health screening is also required, in addition to needing C's or above in GCSE English, mathematics and science. You should look at course descriptions, and ask the universities you speak to what these requirements will be to ensure you can fulfill them, although they are likely to be similar across the board. Teachers are in demand right now, and with the cap on student numbers being lifted this year, universities could potentially be more receptive to Clearing applications for teaching than in previous years. You should not presume this is the case however, and should not expect grade requirements to be lowered, although in some cases they might be.
