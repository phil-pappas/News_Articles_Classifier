Mushroom orientated dishes will draw on traditional recipes and be complemented by wild boar brought in by local hunters, greens collected from the mountainside, cheese from nearby farms and a cellar brimming with extraordinary Greek wine. \nHardly on the tourist radar, the surrounding Zagori region is currently under consideration for the UNESCO world heritage list and home to a myriad of hidden enclaves. A fine food enthusiast’s dream, mushroom foraging takes place from September until late November each year and is a great way to enjoy the spectacular autumnal forests. The property’s expert mountain guide will lead foragers far from the walking paths and into the forests to discover edible varieties of mushrooms which thrive in the damp, cool mountain air. Returning to their cosy mountain rooms, guests can then enjoy a superb dinner and relax beside their very own fireplace overlooking mountain panoramas - an alternative to Greece’s well-trodden ruins and island beaches. Aristi Mountain Resort & Villas is seamlessly on trend with the farm to table movement sweeping the industry, utilising organic ingredients from their very own vegetable garden, free-range meats and sourcing others from local farmers and artisan producers. This is reflected in the property’s restaurant Salvia, named after the indigenous herb of the Zagori area, which is known for its medicinal and aromatic properties. With an extensive menu balancing tradition with innovation, guests can be immersed in the surrounding region with celebrated Epirotic recipes such as Galotiri. This continues as guests return to their rooms, with a fully-stocked mini-bar featuring local beverages such as tsipouro spirits, wine, sparkling spring water and Greek treats such as pasteli (honey/nut bars), mantolato (soft nougat) and halva (sweets made with sesame paste). Aristi Mountain Resort & Villas offers the Mushroom Hunting Package from €250/£176 for 2 people, including two nights stay in a double room, breakfast, transport to and from the excursion point, expert led foraging session, all equipment and freshly foraged dinner at Salvia Restaurant.
