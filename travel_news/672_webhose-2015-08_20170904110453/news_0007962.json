The 35 publishing houses, large and small alike will be together in the marquees. Most of them are organising sessions on their flagship authors, along with activities or talks. Unmissable events, and the list is still growing, are being prepared.\nThe leading publishers\nAlongside the regulars at the Comic Strip Festival, such as Dupuis, Dargaud and Le Lombard, other leading publishers of the ilk of Casterman, Glénat, Joker Editions, Kana, Paquet, Standaard Uitgeverij or even Ballon Media, will be there this year. Thanks to their attributes and their originality, they will all help to make the Comic Strip Festival even more of a real “must”.\nAnd the spotlight will be on the international side of the Comic Strip Festival this year: apart from the international pavilion, the publishing houses will showcase Japanese comic strips for the first time. The Mangas will therefore be represented by Kana and Glénat, and groups will organise numerous activities on the theme. US comics will also have their place in the marquees thanks to Panini Comics and Urban Comics.\nDupuis, the giant of comic strip publishing, will be back this year for the II Spirou Festival. Featuring fifty or so authors, a Spirou feel will be given to the meanderings of the Comic Strip festival. Activities, signing sessions, talks, games and workshops are planned in a larger area this year.\nThe list of the leading publishers:\nBallon Media, BDMUSIC – Confliktarts, Casterman, Dargaud, Dupuis, Editions Paquet, Glénat, Joker Editions, Kana, Le Lombard, Panini Comics, Standaard Uitgeverij, Strip2000, StripGilde, Urban Comics.\nMicro-publishers and independent authors\nThis year, there will be no less than 24 micro-publishers of all genres featured in the marquees. Thanks to them, there will a specific focus on independent creation and up-and-coming young authors. Some stands, such as ZineZone, will also showcase several authors whose work has been published by small publishers. This will be a real opportunity for comic strip fans to come across and discover new works.\nOne such stand will be run by the Wallonie-Bruxelles Federation. Since the early 2000s, the Wallonie-Bruxelles Federation has notably given grants to young authors, cartoonists and screenwriters, and funding to publish “ creative” comic strips. During the Comic Strip Festival, the stand will feature a selection of books that have benefitted from that public support. The comic strips are very wide ranging, but they all have in common their originally, innovation and graphic research.\nA rather out-of-the-ordinary Belgian publisher will also be making its appearance at the Comic Strip Festival this year. Sandawe’s distinguishing feature is that it only publishes comic strips that have been carefully selected and funded by Internet users. The participatory platform is a means to open up publishing outside the box. The stand also provides unpublished young authors with the opportunity to present their project. The Sandawe designers will provide a critical review and tips to help the young authors on their journey to get published.\nThe micro-publishers and independent authors at the Festival:\n180° éditions, Atelier 24, Banque Dessinée, Bandes Gribouillées, BD Must Editions, Belgotaku, Coustoon, Dragon Planète, Editions Bande à Part, Editions du Singe, Editions P’tit Louis, ESA Saint-Luc – Section Arts Numériques, Espace Formations, Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles – Bande Dessinée, Fenice BD Edition, François Polisson, Jean Guichon Editeur, Macadam Valley (Ben Dessy), Michel D’Agostini, Sandawe, SKAD, TokTok Mag, YIL Edition, ZineZone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:17:16.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
