But there's always been a lot of talk about how there are certain things men find appealing in women but. \nNow, a new study claims that most men still perceive beauty based on the whole physical appearance of women rather than isolated body parts as previously believed, new research has revealed. \nResearchers found that attractiveness depends on internal consistency - whether the movement and the shape of the body match each other or not. \n“Our visual system is a sensitive lie detector that perceives even the slightest inconsistencies and responds negatively to them,” said psychology professor Nikolaus Troje from Queen's University in a statement. \nMost previous work on attractiveness focused on the effect of isolated features. The current study demonstrates how important it is that these features fit together well. \nDuring the study, participants were shown schematic point-light displays that depict a person using 15 moving dots. \nThe representation conveyed both the individual characteristics of a person's movements and their individual body shape. \nDr Troje's team isolated these two areas and separately measured the attractiveness of individual movement styles as well as individual body shapes. \nThe researchers then combined the movement style of one person with the body shapes of another person and collected attractiveness ratings from these \"hybrid walkers\". \nThey found that the “hybrid walkers” are deemed less attractive than predicted by the movement and the shape used to make them. \nThe results call for re-examination of earlier research that looked at attractiveness in a piece-meal way. \nThey can also be used to formulate advice to people who are working on improving their own physical appearance. \n“What works for one person may not work for another one. If in doubt, just be yourself,” the authors noted. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:23:26.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
