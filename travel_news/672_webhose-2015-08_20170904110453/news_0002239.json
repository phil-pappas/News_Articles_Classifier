We not only offer passenger services, we offer an overall passenger experience. \n“Talking about the future of the airport, Mr. Al Meer said: “Our future development strategy will focus on increased capacity and additional facilities. The development of our core aviation facilities is based on forecasts of passengers, aircraft growth figures and KPIs relating to service levels, which will all dictate our development plan. Additionally, we have created processes and management structures to manage and deliver our multi-million dollar future investment programmes strategically.” \nWe have now geared up to manage a much larger and more mature business, creating the capability to integrate several diverse service propositions in a manner which will lead to efficiency and an overall experience for our airport stakeholders and our passengers alike,” he concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T19:11:01.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
