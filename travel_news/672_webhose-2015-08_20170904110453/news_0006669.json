Page 1 of 1 \nIt was only a matter of time before someone came up with a fried chicken martini. \nOr a cupcake-dispensing ATM. Or a hotel that allows you to check in — and open your door — with a smartphone. And it was only a matter of time before they happened in Las Vegas. \nWhy? Because they have nothing to do with gambling. \nFor the past decade, since the tipping point when profits from entertainment, hotel rooms, dining and shopping eclipsed the haul from gambling, the industry here has focused on what visitors want beyond the blinking slots and blackjack tables. The restaurants got celebrity chefs, the nightclubs got hipper, the pools got sexier, some hotels went boutique, and Cirque du Soleil figured out a few more ways to tell visual tales with Ukrainian acrobats. \nThe latest and largest example of the shift is the Linq entertainment and shopping district — an outdoor, tree-lined promenade connecting the Strip to the High Roller observation wheel that opened last year — and it’s finally running with all the pieces in place. \nForget “outside the box,” the future of Las Vegas, apparently, is just plain “outside.” (And the Linq’s designers are not the only ones to think so.) \nHedging their bets \nOf the billions spent on new projects and makeovers in Las Vegas during the past five to 10 years, only a small portion was aimed at improving or expanding gaming operations. \nAnd the Linq seems to represent that sensibility. \nThe pedestrian shopping and dining “district,” part of a $550 million project that includes the 550-foot-tall High Roller wheel, fills the corridor between two casino-hotels (the Linq Hotel, formerly the Imperial Palace and the Quad, and the Flamingo), but you have to make an effort to spot gambling. Other than through the side entrances to the hotels, and the nearby O’Shea’s and Margaritaville, the promenade is gambling free. \nIt’s another example of the casino-resort companies “moving retail out front,” according to David Schwartz of the Center for Gaming Research at UNLV. \n“This is definitely the future,” Schwartz said. “Gaming revenues haven’t been rising compared to non-gaming.” \nAnd while the Linq (built and overseen by Caesars Entertainment) is at the front of this particular trend, others have similar plans. MGM Resorts has been unveiling pieces of its own “park, dining and entertainment district,” based on the L.A. Live complex of venues and shopping in Los Angeles, that will include a 20,000-seat arena, a 5,000-seat theater and a pedestrian park with shops in the space between the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. The 6-acre Park project is expected to open in spring 2016. \nHistorically, Las Vegas has seen plenty of non-gambling attractions — roller coasters, thrill rides, resident celebrity theaters — but for the most part, those were all built into casino-hotels, and access required strolling past a soccer field’s worth of roulette tables and sports book lounges. \nWorth the walk \nAt first glance, it seems as if the only reason to walk the quarter mile of the Linq pedestrian mall is to get from the Strip to the High Roller observation wheel, arguably one of the most visible attractions in a town full of attention-grabbing features. \nYou quickly realize, however, that the Promenade is a compact, more concentrated version of the Strip, only without the rivers of traffic (cars and people), no lengthy trek to hotel entrances, no people handing out escort trading cards, and no scores of Mickeys and Minnies, Homer Simpsons, Spider-Men and “showgirls” in unauthorized costumes, posing for tips. Add to that the 40 restaurants and shops, from chic to quirky, with trees and fountains and public art, and it’s easy to see the appeal. \nIt’s appealing, it turns out, to more than just the Vegas visitors who stroll the Strip, according to Ryan Hernandez, operations manager at Brooklyn Bowl, who said he’s seen a younger demographic showing up, as well as more locals. \nWith four dining rooms, five bars, 32 bowling lanes and a 1,800-seat concert venue, Brooklyn Bowl has become the Linq’s entertainment anchor. (Also home of the aforementioned fried chicken martini, although the cocktail is not listed on the most recent menu.) \nThe music venue, specifically, has become a major attraction, for out-of-towners and for locals, Hernandez said. “A lot of families having a date night.” \nSince it opened in March 2014, headliners have included Phil Lesh & Friends, Primus, Elvis Costello & the Roots, Jane’s Addiction and Twenty One Pilots, as well as a laundry list of local and emerging musicians looking for a break in a more intimate setting. \nThe Promenade lacks a truly upscale, white-tablecloth restaurant and tends to skew toward sports fans (O’Shea’s), pub lovers (Yard House) and the white-collar-trying-to-be-blue-collar crowd (Tilted Kilt), although highlights include the two-story Off the Strip Bistro, the nearby Chayo Mexican Kitchen, and Flour & Barley brick-oven pizzas. \nMost of the other snack spots are creative novelty joints: Haute Doggery hot dogs, Sprinkles cupcakes (home of the cupcake ATM), and a San Francisco-themed Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop. The cupcake ATM is fun to watch, although you have to decide if it’s worth $6-$8 of fun for a cupcake. \nThe shopping ranges from Ruby Blue (lingerie and bling-heavy accessories) to lifestyle and novelty shop Kitson and chic shoe store Bella Scarpa. The overall effect is a corridor of approachable spots, night or day, and no winding through casino floors to get to them. \nNew life for landmark \nThe High Roller wheel and the Promenade would not be where they are — at the halfway point of the Strip — had Caesars (Harrah’s at the time) not purchased the faded landmark Imperial Palace back in 2005. There’s been a hotel of one sort or another on that property since 1959, and for almost three decades it was the Asian-themed casino-hotel. \nWhile most of Vegas’ former landmarks tend to be imploded, the Linq Hotel spent $223 million for an extreme makeover, from which little if any of the original Imperial Palace survived. \nAs outdated at the Imperial Palace had become, designers of the Linq Hotel seemed to be trying make up for it. The casino and ground floor are pretty standard for Las Vegas, but the 2,254 rooms have a hip, urban design, modern furnishings, plenty of outlets and a sense of whimsy. The self-check-in feature is a direct targeting of Millennials who don’t want to wait in line if there’s an app that can help them avoid it. \nAs with every new project on the Strip, a stylish, of-the-moment pool scene (day and night) has become a requirement. Linq Hotel renovated the pool deck to have more of a “social, day club experience,” according to Caesars, complete with a DJ and 29 cabana suites — rooms that open onto the pool area. Finished just a few months ago, it was one of the final pieces of the overall Linq project; the pool looks up at the High Roller, but also out onto the Promenade. \nOne of the holdovers from the Imperial Palace era is the Auto Collections at the Linq Hotel, more than 250 cars (although not necessarily displayed at the same time) said to be valued at more than $100 million. \nBig wheel turnin’ \nNot every city that has an observation wheel needs one. In Las Vegas, however, it makes sense. \nAnd without it, the Linq Promenade would be a side street off the Strip with no real destination beyond the Flamingo monorail stop. (Unless, of course, you really care about fried chicken martinis, a cupcake ATM and high-tech check-in.) \nWhen the High Roller opened in March 2014, almost immediately it took a spot as one of the most visible landmarks on the Strip. The wheel is more than 100 feet taller than the 443-foot London Eye (although only 9 feet taller than the Singapore Flyer, the previous record holder), and at the top, the 28 glass cabins are higher from the ground than the observation deck of the Seattle Space Needle. \nEach of the glass-enclosed pods holds about 40 people, in part to move plenty of guests through the 30-minute ride, according to James Donahue, director of operations for the High Roller, but also to increase the social factor of the ride. \nThere are plenty of events, including wedding ceremonies, bachelorette parties and “corporate meetings,” he said. For the right price, you can rent an entire pod. For the right price with more zeros, you can rent the entire wheel. Despite the name, not surprisingly, there are no poker machines or craps tables on the ride, although the company introduced last year a “Happy Half Hour” — for an extra $10-$15, you get to ride a pod with an open bar. \nSay what you will about the sun-bleached desert, during the day, in a city full of mirrored buildings, nearly everything is impressive from a bubble 50 stories up. During the night, it gets better: The suburban sprawl of the city fades into darkness, and the lights of the Strip (and beyond) offer a sense of distance, location and size. \n“They’re a lot of fun to ride around and see the valley, especially during the day, but even at night when you see all the lights of the Strip played out,” said Donahue. \nThe ride also affords an overall view of the Linq Hotel and Promenade, finally finished. Future riders will probably be able to spot MGM’s Park project taking shape, as well as other changes meant to push retail and social features forward, especially if they turn more of the Strip into outdoor parks and plazas. \nSpud Hilton is the editor of Travel.
