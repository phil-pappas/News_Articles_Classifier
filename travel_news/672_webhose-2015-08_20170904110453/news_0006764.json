The commencement of United Kingdom school holidays in mid-July also brought families to the capital, and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the British Pound has contributed to an increase in U.S. visitors.\nAfter a slow first half of 2015, July’s demand growth and improved performance indicators point to a stronger second half for London.\nSTR Global will release July 2015 results during the week of 24 August. The August edition of the STR Global Hotel Market Forecast also will be available at the end of the month.\nSource: STR Global.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T16:51:36.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
