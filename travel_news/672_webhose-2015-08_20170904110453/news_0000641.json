More and more are taking the opportunity to head off on a gap year trip to broaden their work and life experience, and boost their CV with overseas work experience. \n“Working Holiday Visas for Australia and New Zealand continue to be one of the most popular options for young travellers as it enables them to work to earn money for further travels, as well as widening their skill set. \n“What we are seeing is great demand for guidance and advice on what to see and do in destinations, as well as help on ensuring that time and budget is used in the best possible way. \n“The boom in volunteering and conservation projects highlights a shift towards responsible travel, as young people usually want to give something back to the communities they visit, as well as learning new skills. \n“Among the most popular volunteering projects are working with rescue elephants in Thailand, sea turtle conservation in Costa Rica and teaching children in Cambodia. \n“Taking part in these kinds of projects allows you to really get under the skin of a country or community, as well as broadening your horizons, meeting new people and opening yourself up to new experiences.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:40:38.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
