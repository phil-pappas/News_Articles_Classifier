As an iconic London landmark we recognise and are committed to contributing to promoting a greener future\".Having first opened in 1906, almost 110 years ago, The Ritz London has shown committment at all levels of the business to both the conservation of the Grade II listed building as well as contributing to the future well-being of the environment.The award recognizes The Ritz team's work in reducing the hotel's environmental impact and carbon footprint through sustainable practices.As well as being a member of the Sustainable Restaurants Association, Ritz London has also partnered with CleanConscience, an innovative new company set up with the aim of reducing waste from the hospitality industry from hitting landfills, by recovering partly used soap and guest amenities.CleanConscience manually sort, sterilise and reprocess soaps and toiletries and distribute globally to people suffering from life threatening diseases, preventable by the simple process of hand washing with soap.The hotel also has a policy of purchasing the freshest ingredients available to the market place for each season. Local suppliers and where possible fair-trade produce are utilised to reduce the carbon footprint, enabling the shortest distance from farm to fork.The kitchen has been recently renovated and now uses induction throughout with no gas, making it far more energy efficient. The new workspace enables the majority of cooking to be done on planchas, minimising the need for fats and oils and the many traditional pots and pans, and therefore reducing the amount of water used in washing up and grease in the drainage system.Valere Tjolle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T09:58:01.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
