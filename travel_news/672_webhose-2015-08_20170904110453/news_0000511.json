The examination of the part is being carried out under the direction of a judge at an aeronautical test facility run by the French military at Balma, a suburb of Toulouse. Reunion is one of France's overseas territories.\nMalaysian officials who are leading an international air crash investigation were due to witness the inspection of the part, which was flown to the French mainland at the weekend.\nOfficials from the United States and manufacturer Boeing were also on hand to advise whether the piece can be tied to MH370, which went missing on March 8 last year while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board.\nThe initial examination was expected to last until Thursday but Malaysian officials were on stand-by in Kuala Lumpur in case any results could be announced on Wednesday.\nMalaysia has said the piece of debris, a wing surface known as a flaperon, had been identified as being from a Boeing 777.\nThe airliner is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) from Reunion.\nInvestigators will try to confirm that the part comes from the MH370 and glean whatever information they can about the cause of the crash.\nBut the question of why the aircraft vanished may be clearer only when the main debris field is found, and its flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered.\n\"A wing's moving surfaces give you far fewer clues than bigger structures like the rudder, for example. As a single piece of evidence, it is likely to reveal quite little other than it comes from MH370,\" a former investigator said.\nInvestigators will examine the flaperon for numbers that could tie it to the missing jet.\n(Reuters)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:23:21.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
