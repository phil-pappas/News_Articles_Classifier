One man destroyed a sedan's rear window with a large rock.\nCarnage as Uber drivers are attacked at Mexico City airport This man tries to wrench the side mirror from the taxi using the mobile app Uber\nPeople were angry with how Uber is taking taxi bookings away from the more conventional methods\n'What happened is a very grave attack on everyone's freedom and right to make a living in a dignified manner,' Uber said in a statement.\n'Incidents like this are completely unacceptable, and we trust that authorities will act so that justice is done.'\nThe assault and the taxi drivers' demonstration outside the Colombian Embassy to proclaim solidarity with cabbies in that country and around the world are a clear signal that recently issued regulations designed to create a legal framework for Uber and the smaller Cabify have not put an end to Mexico City's simmering taxi dispute.\n It's got creature comforts: Hostel boasting multiple...

The animal kingdom as you've never seen it before:... 72 shares Uber spokeswoman Rocio Paniagua told Televisa news that between 10 and 12 cars were damaged in the attack on Tuesday. Some drivers were struck, but there were no reports of serious injuries.\nShe said taxi cabs were used to block off the street, but those who took part were not carrying anything to identify who they were.\nAt Wednesday's protest, leaders of the Organized Taxi Drivers of Mexico City union denied any involvement in the 'regrettable' incident. They promised to pursue only legal avenues, and said the attack was carried out by people fed up with Uber drivers parking in their neighbourhood for airport pickups.\n'They are decisions that the neighbours of the area made, but we have nothing to do with it,' union spokesman Juan Carlos Rovira said. 'We say so categorically.'\nWindscreen wipers were ripped off, and cars pelted with eggs and flour as tensions grew in Mexico City\nUber is said to be taking away business for many of the licensed drivers who are based at Mexico City Airport\nEarlier this month Mexico City became the first city in Latin America to set down official regulations for smartphone-based ride services like Uber.\nThey call for the companies to pay 1.5 per cent of fares to a fund for improving transportation; require drivers to register and submit to annual inspections; and bar them from accepting cash or establishing the equivalent of taxi stands.\nCabbies questioned whether Uber drivers may have been breaking that last rule by parking outside the airport. Paniagua said the company's drivers are not permitted to wait on airport grounds, so they stay in the surrounding streets until customers who summoned rides are in a place where they can be picked up.\nSeveral dozen medallion-cab drivers rallied at the demonstration, setting off firecrackers. They hoisted signs calling rideshare operators 'criminals' and criticising Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera for letting them operate.\nUber spokeswoman Rocio Paniagua said that between 10 and 12 cars were damaged in the attack\nThey vowed to continue pushing for the regulations to be repealed or modified until they feel there is a truly level playing field.\n'These transnational applications are infiltrating different countries as an economic parasite, endangering the livelihood of thousands of taxi drivers and their families and devouring the market for the legally established service,' union official Ignacio Rodriguez said.\nHowever, Uber is increasingly popular among middle and upper-class Mexicans as they turn to what they consider a safer, more reliable, more pleasant, convenient and cost-competitive alternative to street cabs.\nIn a recent poll, 80 per cent of Mexico City residents surveyed gave Uber positive ratings, compared with 52 per cent for medallion cabs. Just 12 per cent said they backed a ban on Uber.\nUber is increasingly popular among middle- and upper-class Mexicans\nSeveral dozen medallion-cab drivers rallied at the demonstration, setting off firecrackers\nFrancisco Rodriguez Esquivel, a 61-year-old who has been driving a cab for 15 years, said the airport attack was the 'unfortunate' but unsurprising result of pent-up frustration.\n'I think it's a logical consequence, that people start to get desperate because these companies continue to work and are probably even laughing at us,' Rodriguez said. 'The struggle continues, and it is going to continue until this gets fixed.'\nLast month singer Courtney Love was the passenger in a taxi using Uber when it was attacked in Paris, France.\nThe 50-year-old actress and singer tweeted pictures and videos from inside her taxi after it was attacked by cabbies protesting against rival firm Uber.\nShe said: 'They've ambushed our car and are holding our driver hostage. They're beating the cars with metal bats. This is France?? I'm safer in Baghdad.'\nHer car was attacked shortly after she landed at Charles de Gaulle airport as mobs of taxi drivers blockaded roads and targeted Uber drivers, even flipping some of their cars over.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1eDjHIY"], "published": "2015-07-31T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:01:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
