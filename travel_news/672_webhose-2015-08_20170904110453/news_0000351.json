But soon he realized the strange creature would neither eat nor take water, and he decided to give the snake to specialists at the Nanning Zoo.\nThe snake, pencil-thin, with a dark brown backside, still has yet to eat on its own, a Nanning Zoo official told the website. It is about 20 centimeters long and has been alive for 10 days, having shed its skin once, they noted.\nFirst Snake Crawled On Four Feet: Photos\nBecause each head has its own brain, the two halves can move independently, and Nanning Zoo experts say the two heads often come together, as if they are going to fight. But scientists there say that's because the typical cobra will move in an \"S\" shape, and the two heads will naturally butt.\nThe rare snake could conceivably grow to a typical Chinese cobra length of about 1.2 meters, but zoo doctors are unable to tell how much longer it might live if it doesn't begin to eat on its own, and they also worry about its potentially low resistance to infection.\nHat tip The Daily Mail\nTags Snakes Rare Animals ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://sd.people.com.cn/n/2015/0810/c172837-25923762.html", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3193468/Sssurprise-venomous-cobra-TWO-heads-fight-opposite-ways-try-swallow-other.html"], "published": "2015-08-11T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:27:08.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
