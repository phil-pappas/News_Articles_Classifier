Alaina Harrison, 18, from Esh Winning near Durham, noticed that a non-native plant called Himalayan Balsam, which can grow up to three metres tall, was taking over the banks of the River Deerness and smothering all other life in its path. She decided to take action and teamed up with Fixers, the charity which helps young people campaign on issues that matter to them, to eradicate the weed by organising ‘Balsam bashes’ . Alaina is recruiting local villagers to ‘bash’ the weed away by uprooting it so that other plants stand a chance of surviving. • The UK's most invasive plants She says: “I’ve lived around here for the past five years and I’ve watched it spread all the way from Durham to our village. I loved seeing the British wildflowers and blackberries, but you don’t see them anymore because the whole riverbank has been taken over by Himalayan balsam.” But the weed isn’t just a problem in Alaina’s village – it’s taken over 13 per cent of riverbanks in England and Wales. It was introduced as a greenhouse plant in Britain in 1839 and soon escaped into the wild. According to Professor Ian Rotherham of Sheffield Hallam University and author of Invasive and Introduced Plants and Animals , people were delighted by its pink orchid-like flowers and it soon escaped from their gardens into the wild. Himalayan Balsam can grow up to 3 metres tall Photo: ALAMY Once it’s taken root, Himalayan balsam grows at a fearsome speed. Each plant produces an average of 800 seeds, which can be fired 20ft from its stem, allowing it to spread quicker than native plants. The weed is now eroding riverbanks because it leaves bare soil after it dies back in the winter, leaving banks prone to bursting and flooding the surrounding area. Alaina, who is studying business at New College Durham, says: “It stops British plants from flourishing and increases the chances of flood risks to neighbouring homes. It must be stopped. ” That is why conservationists like Alaina organise ‘Balsam Bashes’ throughout the summer to rid Britain of the scourge. • Pink Himalayan flower threatening British countryside She has designed a poster, supported by Fixers, showing local residents how they can get involved. The Canal and River Trust says it has seen a rise in ‘balsam bashing’ in recent years, after funding cuts meant council contractors could no longer keep the plant at bay. The vigilantes uproot every one of the plants they come across and leave them to dry up and die. She says: “If we can make more people aware of it then we can get more hands on deck at clear-ups. At the very least, we can stop the problem getting worse.” Fixers works with young people aged 16-25 across the UK and provides them with resources to help them campaign on issues they feel strongly about. The charity has helped more than 16,000 youngsters across the UK to have a voice in their community. Fixers aims to work with more than 70,000 young people by 2020 and to do this needs to raise funds.
