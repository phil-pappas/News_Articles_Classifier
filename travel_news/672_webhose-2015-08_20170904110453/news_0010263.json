In the past decade, Brooklyn has become the city’s culinary incubator, the borough where innovative chefs create food trends that go on to take over the rest of the city, the country, and even the world.

You won’t find legendary institutions like Nathan’s Famous or Di Fara Pizza on this list of our favorite eateries—we think of them as places to get a quick bite, and we love them for that—but you will find a collection of outstanding locations where you can sit, have a proper meal, and taste the best of what Brooklyn has to offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T08:24:50.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
