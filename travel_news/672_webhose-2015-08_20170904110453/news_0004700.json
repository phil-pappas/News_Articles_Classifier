But it all looked worse than it actually was.\nThat's the gist of a report from The Tennessean newspaper , which reports the flames came from a Cincinnati-bound regional jet operated by Delta Connection affiliate SkyWest.\nFULL REPORT: Plane catches fire at Nashville airport ( The Tennessean )\nAirport spokeswoman Shannon Sumrall tells the Tennessean the incident occurred around 6:45 a.m. local time (7:45 a.m. ET) as the plane pushed back from the jet bridge. The newspaper writes \"the engine turned on and an auxiliary unit caught fire. When the pilot turned off the engine, the fire extinguished itself.\"\nDelta spokesman Michael Thomas confirmed the incident to Today in the Sky, offering the following statement from the company.\n\"Prior to departure, SkyWest flight 4811, operating as Delta Connection, from Nashville to Cincinnati, experienced a brief flame upon engine startup, which immediately dissipated. There was no fire and no emergency was declared. Technicians are evaluating the CRJ-200 aircraft and we are working to help customers resume their travel as quickly as possible. The safety of our customers and SkyWest people is our top priority.\"\nThere were 50 passengers and three crewmembers on the flight, according to Delta.\nImages of flames were captured by fliers at the airport and posted to social media.\nTwitter user Matt Miller posted a picture showing the flames with a caption reading: \"Awkward moment when your plane catches on fire.\"\nAwkward moment when your plane catches on fire. pic.twitter.com/SDOzj6UII0\n— Matt Miller (@thematt_miller) August 7, 2015 University of Utah professor Jason Taylor said he was standing at gate B7 waiting to board his plane to Salt Lake City when he saw the flames coming from the back of the plane.\nHe also shared a photo showing the flames via Twitter.\nengine fire on Skywest plane on tarmac at Nashville airport. Fire is out and plane looks ok now. @Nashville_ABC pic.twitter.com/JlKT7ngb5R\n— Jason Taylor (@jltaylo) August 7, 2015 \"Within five to 10 seconds the fire went out on its own,\" Taylor, 31, tells the Tennessean . \"A lot of the ground workers were running toward the plane. It extinguished pretty quickly and some emergency personnel arrived.\"\n\"The ball of fire lasted for several seconds,\" Taylor adds. \"It freaked a lot of people out. You don't often see fires on planes.\"\nDespite how it may have appeared to observers in the terminal, passengers on Flight 4811 suggested the situation didn't seem as dramatic onboard.\nNashville resident Phil Cobucci, 32, was on the plane and tells the Tennessean that the plane had just pulled back from the gate when the captain came over the loud speaker.\n\"No one heard anything. The plane really just stopped in the middle of the tarmac,\" Cobucci says. \"The captain said, 'We had a misfire,' which didn't really make it sound like the picture I saw (later) when they started popping up on Twitter.\"\nThe Tennessean is owned by Gannett, parent company of USA TODAY.\n203 CONNECT 41 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1NeY3Xu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745414050533522-twitter.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1NeY3Xu", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28e72539f56348e796e91d175293ddbe04770007/c=0-0-768-1024&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/08/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635745414050533522-twitter.jpg", "https://twitter.com/jltaylo/status/629617792141127680", "http://t.co/SDOzj6UII0", "http://t.co/JlKT7ngb5R", "https://twitter.com/thematt_miller/status/629619168245997568", "https://twitter.com/Nashville_ABC", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1NeY3Xu&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1NeY3Xu&text=Photos%20show%20flames%20coming%20from%20Delta%20Connection%20jet%20in%20Nashville&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-08-07T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:15:08.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
