Others, however, have not been as fortunate. There can be too much of a good thing, and if some of your vegetables aren’t producing bumper crops, the problem might be a result of all of that extra-warm sunshine.\nWhen temperatures exceed 90 degrees, it can cause even sun lovers such as tomatoes, eggplants and peppers to drop their blooms before they are pollinized, resulting in reduced fruit set.\nGardening Events Ciscoe’s Picks ‘A Closer Look: Woodland Garden’ at the Washington Park Arboretum: 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Sept. 1.

Pole beans often won’t form flowers in excessive heat. Squash also are affected by high temperatures. Excessively hot weather causes the plant to produce far more male flowers than female ones, resulting in a vastly reduced yield. Excess heat can also have a negative effect on the flavor of cucumbers, giving them a bitter taste.\nThere isn’t a lot a home gardener can do to prevent heat-related problems. Plants need sun to grow and produce, so it doesn’t help to shade them. About the best thing you can do is to make sure the plants are well-watered, avoid over-fertilization and mulch with a 3-inch deep layer of straw or compost to slow evaporation and keep roots cooler.\nI’d recommend planting your tomatoes where they won’t get reflected sunlight and heat next year, but if I do, we’ll undoubtedly revert to our usual cooler conditions, and you’ll remember that I’m the one who gave you that advice as you fry up all those green tomatoes that never ripened!\nConsider becoming a Master Gardener Did you know the Master Gardener program began here in Washington in 1973? It was the brainchild of two Washington State University Extension horticultural faculty assigned to King and Pierce counties who found it impossible to keep up with overwhelming public demand for information about plant problems. They developed the idea to offer individuals first-rate training in return for donating time to help others.\nAfter attending classes based on environmentally sound, research-based gardening practices, volunteers were required to pass exams and commit to volunteering a certain amount of hours working with the public.\nSoon after the first class of 300 volunteers graduated, the program took off, and now the Master Gardener program has expanded to all 50 states, several Canadian provinces and other countries.\nApplications for the Master Gardener class of 2016 are available. The program is open to anyone with an interest in gardening and a willingness to use their knowledge, experience and enthusiasm to help others.\nThe 2016 classes will be held 12 consecutive Saturdays from January through March at the Center for Urban Horticulture on the University of Washington campus, and include online training. Due to the costs associated with the instruction, there is a charge of approximately $275 per person, although a limited number of scholarships are available.\nHaving been a Master Gardener for more than 30 years, I’ve seen the positive effect this program has had in helping home gardeners and the environment. Best of all, you’ll meet a wonderful bunch of people to work with!\nThe submission deadline for applications is Oct. 16.
