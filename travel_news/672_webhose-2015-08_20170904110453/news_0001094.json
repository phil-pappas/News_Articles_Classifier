Ravell Call, Deseret News Summary \nUtah smoke-free advocates are protesting the decision to include smoking rooms in design plans for the new Salt Lake City International Airport. “ This isn't a moral issue for us, either. It's about managing the reality of the passenger demographic in a way that best assures the health and safety of all passengers.” Art Raymond, Mayor Becker's spokesman \nSALT LAKE CITY — Waiting for his flight back home to Texas on Monday, Joshua Lewis lit a cigarette inside a smoking room at Salt Lake City International Airport. \nLewis said he knows how hard air travel can be for smokers, especially when airports don't provide smoking rooms. He remembered when he almost missed a flight in Minneapolis when he had to re-enter security after going outside for a smoke. \n\"It's a very big challenge,\" he said. \"Traveling is stressful anyway.\" \nThat's why Lewis said he appreciates the smoking rooms in Salt Lake City's airport. \nBut as Lewis smoked, Maggie Podunovich waited for her flight back to Colorado in the boarding area outside of the smoking room. She said as an ex-smoker, she understands how powerful the addiction is, but she doesn't think airports should provide smoking rooms. \n\"I'm not condemning anybody; I just don't want to be around it,\" she said. \"You can't smoke in a restaurant or in a bar, and you certainly can't smoke on TRAX, so no. I would not encourage it.\" \nPointing to public health issues, Utah smoke-free advocates are protesting the decision to include smoking rooms in design plans for the new Salt Lake City International Airport. \nScott Barton, a medical director at Molina Healthcare of Utah and chairman of the Utah Tobacco Free Alliance, says airport smoking rooms present health risks to the public and are becoming less common in large U.S. airports. \n\"If Salt Lake City's airport remains a smoking airport, it will be one of seven of the top 35 busiest airports that still allow smoking,\" Barton said. \"Do we want this to be the face of Utah?\" \nBut city and airport officials say they're planning to include smoking rooms for that exact reason — to protect travelers from secondhand smoke. \n\"Eliminating smoking rooms doesn't eliminate the behavior of smoking,\" said airport spokeswoman Bianca Shreeve. \"The bottom line is that smoking is a pretty powerful addiction, and providing a place for smokers to smoke gives us the ability to control it, and that's beneficial for the traveling public in general.\" \nThe airport currently includes five smoking rooms. After construction is completed on the new terminal, which Shreeve said will break ground later this year, it will house two smoking rooms. \nBut Barton said Salt Lake City's airport should be following the example of other airports around the nation. He cited the American Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, which stated in a report last month that now more than 600 U.S. airports that have become 100 percent smoke-free, including Los Angeles, Chicago O'Hare, and John F. Kennedy airports. \n\"Somehow these other major airports have figured it out and have gone completely smoke-free. Why not us?\" Barton said. \nHe pointed out that there are other ways to deal with the addiction, including nicotine patches or gum. \nHowever, Shreeve said smoke-free airports still struggle with finding stray cigarette butts, and they face operational challenges when travelers exit terminals to smoke outside and then re-enter, aggravating security lines. \n\"For us being a connecting hub airport where people have really short connections between flights, it may not be realistic for someone who has a smoking habit to exit the secure area,\" Shreeve said. \"People will find a way to smoke. If we don’t provide room, they’ll find a private spot to smoke, and we definitely don’t want that.\" \nAre smoking rooms safe?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:19:06.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
