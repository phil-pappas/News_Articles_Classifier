Hertz alleges that Ryanair’s agreement with GDS distribution companies represents a breach of contract, a claim it disputes.\nRyanair CEO Michael O’Leary said: “Following an extensive tender process, Ryanair is pleased to partner with Cartrawler, who offer the best conversion rate in the business, as we launch Ryanair Car Hire, offering the widest range and best value car rental service to our 103m customers.”\nLast week, Ryanair said it would appeal a court ruling over flight delay compensation claims. A Manchester court said Ryanair could not cut the amount of time a passenger has to claim flight delay compensation from six years to two.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-08-26T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T21:33:45.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
