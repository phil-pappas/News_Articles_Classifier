The benefit of this increase in visitor numbers for the wider Scottish economy is estimated to be in excess of £1m.\nAgainst the backdrop of a landmark year for Scottish event tourism following the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Wednesday’s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) announcement serves as a clear illustration of Scotland’s ability to attract and capacity to stage the world’s most prestigious events.\nThis is added to a remarkable portfolio of national and international events which have long been scheduled to take place in Scotland in 2015. The 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships in March and a summer-long programme of golfing events, including The Open Championship and the Ricoh Women’s British Open, have already been delivered.\nSource:-Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:44:55.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
