For the huge costs of a third runway at Heathrow you could build Gatwick, have all the benefits and billions left to invest around the country.\n‘We also learnt today that – buried deep in the report – is the revelation that a third runway would reduce rather than increase domestic connections to the UK. This blows a hole straight through the heart of Heathrow’s central claim to be the airport for the whole of the UK.\n‘Taken together with Heathrow’s own rejection of the environmental conditions and the expert view that the Davies air quality consultation is fundamentally flawed it is clear that that the Heathrow hurdles are higher than ever. Choose Heathrow and it will be Groundhog Day – nothing will happen. Choose Gatwick and Britain can finally get on with it.’\nSource:- Gatwick Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T16:57:21.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
