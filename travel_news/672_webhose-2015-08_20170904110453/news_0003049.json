Passengers can then drop luggages off at bag drop counters after personally tagging their belongings. Instructional videos, signs and staff will be on site to guide passengers in the process. \n\nThose with carry-on bags only may print their boarding passes at the kiosks and proceed directly to departures. Alternatively, those who have done online or mobile check-in can skip the counters entirely and proceed to departures with their home-printed or mobile phone passes in hand. \n\nIn a press statement, CAG said FAST is expected to streamline the check-in experience and improve efficiency as customers get accustomed to the new processes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T19:25:17.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
