The Caribe Hilton Hotel and Condado Plaza Hilton participated in training programs that ensured their services were responsive to medical guests from safety requirements and interpersonal communication to cultural sensitivity protocols and disease prevention practices.\nThe Puerto Rico Medical Tourism Corporation, an arm of the commonwealth’s tourism structure, is in the midst of an aggressive campaign to market the island’s healthcare services to international patients. In the next three years, those efforts are hoped to create some 3,000 jobs and inject $300 million into the island’s economy.\nFrancisco G. Bonet, executive director of the Puerto Rico Medical Tourism Corporation, said, in addition to the Caribe Hilton and Condado Plaza, a half-dozen more hotels in Puerto Rico are expected to complete WellHotel™ certification requirements by the end of this year.\n“As part of our strategic plan, we hired the MTA for the process of training and certification to entities that not only provide healthcare, but also complimentary services to medical tourism patients. Many of these hotels are already in their final stage and, today, we are pleased to announce the first certifications for Caribe Hilton and Condado Plaza,” said Bonet, who recognized Metro Pavia, HIMA San Pablo and Ashford Presbyterian Community as healthcare providers in Puerto Rico that had participated in an earlier round of training that, when finished, would certify some 35 hospitals to offer medical tourism services to foreign patients.\nThe Puerto Rico Medical Tourism Corporation is a sponsor of the World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015, in Orlando, Fla., where investors and entrepreneurs can learn about healthcare and tourism services in Puerto Rico and how public officials are joining with the private sector to revitalize the Caribbean island into a hub for medical tourism.\nSource: Medical Tourism Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:15:27.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
