The team at Madame Tussauds has done an incredible job with the figure. I'm truly amazed at how much work has gone into making his likeness as authentic as possible. His wax figure will help keep Steve's memory, and his mission to protect wildlife and wild places, alive.\" \nIrwin died when he was attacked by a stingray while filming off the coast of Queensland.
