There will also be a Cantina and the chance to take control of the Millennium Falcon — one of the signature attractions. \nOne adventure also promises to put guests \"in the middle of a climactic battle between the First Order and the Resistance.\" \nSince 1987, Disney parks have only had the Star Tours ride as their \"Star Wars\" themed attraction, and even that will be getting a facelift to reflect the new characters and worlds from December's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" The ride was previously updated in 2011. \nMore comprehensive brand integration into the parks has been expected since Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012. Disney will also be adding the interactive Star Wars Launch Bay and introducing a new seasonal event, Season of the Force, which will update Space Mountain to become Hyperspace Mountain where guests will participate in an X-Wing battle. \nWalt Disney Parks and Resorts Chairman Bob Chapek announced an upcoming Toy Story Land at Disney's Hollywood Studios, featuring exaggeratedly large objects to make guests feel as though they are actually in Andy's backyard. \nFilmmakers James Cameron and Jon Landau also previewed the currently-under construction World of AVATAR at Disney's Animal Kingdom.
