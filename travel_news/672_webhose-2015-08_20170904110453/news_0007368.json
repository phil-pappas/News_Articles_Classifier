Here are five scenic destinations to consider: \nGrand Teton National Park, Wyoming \nFor jaw-dropping beauty, lace up and explore the jagged peaks of the magnificent Teton Range hear Jackson Hole. Trails that hug the shores of String, Leigh and Trapper lakes are ideal for families. With little elevation gain, the flat terrain provides ample opportunity to photograph the Tetons reflected in the water, wade into the shallow lake and picnic along the shoreline where the views will astound your entire crew. \nTackle a Colorado 14er \nThe Centennial State is home to dozens of 14,000-foot peaks that beckon residents and visitors alike. Whether you make it to the summit or simply relish the high-altitude views, several of the trails are viable for adventuresome and fit families. \nAt 14,060 feet, Mount Bierstadt is both the closest peak to Denver and considered among the most approachable. Plan to arrive early, hydrate well and be off the mountain by midday to avoid dangerous thunderstorms that can roll in quickly. \nShenandoah National Park \nMore than 500 trails snake through this National Park in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains, just 75 miles from Washington, D.C. Access family-friendly trails via the 105-mile long Skyline Drive, a historic National Scenic Byway that traverses the park. The highway also offers 75 scenic overlooks to stop and appreciate the region's natural beauty. The 3.5-mile Lewis Springs Fall Loop is popular with families and offers scenic views and waterfalls. The Stony Man Summits and lower cliffs is the same length, offering stunning vistas with only 500 feet of elevation change. \nSouthern California's Backbone Trail \nNot far from the Hollywood action you'll find the 68-mile Backbone Trail, extending the length of the Santa Monica Mountains. Choose from a handful of day hike options. Try the Ray Miller Trail, accessed through Point Mugu State Park. \nScenic views of Ventura County can be seen from the 6-mile loop trail, starting at the trailhead off Yerba Buena road. Either way, you'll be worlds away from the urban hustle. \nCanyonlands, Utah \nFor long views, sunny days and unique land formations, consider a hike into the history-rich Canyonlands. It's a photographer's dream landscape, so keep your camera handy as you choose among short strolls, longer day hikes or more strenuous outings. \nThe 2-mile Grand View Point trail offers panoramic views of the Island in the Sky Mesa. To learn about how the Anasazi lived in the area, consider the Aztec Butte Trail, where some of their rock structures are still visible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T23:48:03.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
