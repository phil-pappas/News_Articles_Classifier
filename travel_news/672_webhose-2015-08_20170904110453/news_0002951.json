Are the Atlanta Falcons in the hotel business? They could be. The team is considering being an equity partner in a proposed major new convention hotel in downtown Atlanta. The Georgia World Congress Center Authority (GWCCA) just released a formal request for proposals to five finalist firms for a planned 800 to 1,200-room hotel on the campus of the Georgia World Congress Center. It includes several incentives for developers, including the Falcons’ interest in providing equity and/or a guarantee of annual room nights. It could mark another sports team looking for revenue beyond the traditional means. The Atlanta Braves are in the midst of a massive mixed-use project surrounding their new ballpark, SunTrust Park, in Cobb County. It’s supposed to bring the team additional revenue that it can use for operations, including possibly payroll. A spokeswoman for the Falcons was not immediately available for comment. Of course, the new GWCC hotel would rise up near the $1.5 billion New Atlanta Stadium, which will house the Falcons when it’s completed in 2017. It would sit where the Georgia Dome does today and next to Building C of the Congress Center. Besides the Falcons potential involvement, other incentives could include: the Georgia Tourism Development Act, property/ad valorem tax benefits, the Westside Tax Allocation District, state sales and use tax exemptions, and equity participation or incentives from a hotel brand or management company. “The GWCCA envisions minimal public investment other than the subject real property and a compliment of incentives,” says an addendum to the RFP. Five development teams are in consideration for the project: Capella Hotel Group, Drew Co., Garfield Public-Private, Legacy Property Group/ Stormont Hospitality, and Matthews Southwest. The RFP also laid out expectations for the hotel, which if built at 1,200 rooms, could become one of the city’s largest hotels. It would be developed in a public/private joint venture and development costs are estimated to be $207 million to $245 million. “It is envisioned that the new hotel should create and support new demand for GWCC facilities, promote larger events in adjacent areas of the GWCC, and possibly spur additional development in the area,” says the RFP. Among the hotel’s features, the GWCCA is looking for 60,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 25,000-square-foot ballroom. It also wants amenities such as an “upscale steakhouse, a large sports bar, a casual three-meal restaurant, specialty coffee shop and several lounge bars.” It’s expected the finalists will submit along with their proposals the hotel brand each is considering. The GWCCA is seeking a “nationally recognized upper upscale to luxury brand affiliation,” according to the RFP. The deadline to submit proposals is Oct. 1. GWCCA expects to award the project by Oct. 30. Among the finalists for the hotel project are veteran Atlanta developers including Capella Hotel Group, led by legendary hotelier Horst Schulze, a co-founder and former president and chief operating officer of The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. Capella is his new collection of ultra-luxury hotels, which have opened in places including Sochi, Russia, for last year’s Winter Olympic Games. Legacy and Stormont is another powerhouse Atlanta team. Legacy, led by David Marvin, has a vast downtown portfolio that includes the Embassy Suites Atlanta at Centennial Olympic Park and the Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown, as well as several restaurants including Der Biergarten and Twin Smokers. Stormont, led by Jim Stormont, is the same developer that’s planning a $100 million hotel and conference center at Alpharetta’s Avalon. The developer also built hotels near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport including the 403-room Atlanta Airport Marriott Gateway. Dallas, Texas-based Garfield Public-Private has a portfolio that includes convention centers and hotels in New Mexico, Michigan, Oregon and Puerto Rico. Lewisville, Texas-based Matthews Southwest has worked on projects such as the Omni Convention Center Hotel in Dallas, Texas. And, Boston, Mass.-based Drew Co. was behind projects such as Comcast Center in Mansfield, Mass. \nWant Atlanta Sports Business news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
