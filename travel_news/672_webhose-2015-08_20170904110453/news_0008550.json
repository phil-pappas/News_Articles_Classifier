It’s the best dual-season city. In the summer, you can enjoy Lake Geneva , perfect for water sports, while in the winter you can ski. I first visited 25 years ago, to compete in the Athletics Grand Prix. I’ve been back many times since, for up to eight weeks at a time. When I took part in the Dancing on Ice Goes Gold ice-skating show in 2012, I went to Geneva to train for several weeks. The beauty and calmness of the city are also very attractive, and it’s so international, with French, German and English spoken. I really feel at ease there. • Geneva: a cultural guide Anything special I should pack? As long as you dress and prepare for the seasons, you will be fine. Last summer the temperatures reached around 32C. What do you miss most when away? The peace and tranquillity, and the slower pace of life. I miss its mix of luxury and nature, with all its shops and the lovely backdrop of Mont Blanc and Lake Geneva in the forefront. Lake Geneva Photo: Fotolia/AP What’s the first thing you do on arrival? I like to have a coffee to catch up with friends, who, fortunately for me, own boats, so I can wakeboard easily in the summer. I also love to cycle around the lake on my mountain bike. Where’s the best place to stay? La Réserve (22 959 59 59: lareserve.ch ) , where I took my parents last year. It offers a private boat shuttle service in the summer that takes visitors to the town centre. Its bar is pleasant and the Tsé Fung restaurant offers great Chinese cuisine. • La Reserve: hotel review Where would you meet for a drink? The FloorTwo Bar at Grand Hotel Kempinksi (22 908 90 81; kempinski.com ) has great views over Lake Geneva, the Old Town and the Alps. It is close to the city centre, so it’s a convenient meeting spot. Geneva along the Rhône river Photo: Fotolia/AP Where’s the best place for lunch? Globus (58 578 50 50; globus.ch ) , a department store similar to Harvey Nichols in London, has a fantastic food hall where you can get all sorts of high-quality dishes. And for dinner? Le Relais de L’Entrecôte (22 310 60 04: relaisentrecote.fr ), which offers a very simple menu, so for the main course you can have only steak, fries and salad. Their desserts are also simple, but delicious. Where would you send a first-time visitor? The Oui-Non sculpture by Markus Raetz on the Rue du Rhône. As you walk past, the sign changes as you read it from Oui to Non. It isn’t far from the Flower Clock (22 909 70 00; ville-geneve.ch ), another local landmark. The Jet d’Eau fountain is spectacular and worth a close look, even though you may get wet. In the Old Town, there is the impressive St Pierre Cathedral (22 311 75 75; saintpierre-geneve.ch ) , which you must climb up a hill to reach. It is very peaceful inside. As Geneva is such a thriving commercial centre as well, the United Nations Office (22 917 48 96: unog.ch ) is worth a visit. The organisation has an interesting history. The Parc des Bastions park is fun. It has these giant black-and-white boards for playing chess. Not far from the city, there are mountain resorts for hiking, or you can pop to France for a day trip in Annecy, which is particularly beautiful. Parc des Bastions Photo: Fotolia/AP What should I avoid? Arriving without a lot of money. It is an expensive city to visit, and without adequate funds you won’t be able to enjoy it. • Geneva a step closer for Eurostar passengers Public transport or taxi? Public transport. Taxis are hugely expensive. The buses, trams and trains are good, and you can use a yellow boat taxi, known as mouette, to travel across the lake. The city is great for cycling, too. Manbag or moneybelt? It’s a safe place. If you dropped your wallet, it is more likely someone would find you to return it rather than take anything. The Old Town of Geneva Photo: Fotolia/AP What should I bring home? Chocolate. It really is the best in the world. I go to Merkur Confiserien AG metro Shopping de Cornavin (22 732 41 82; rue du Mont-Blanc 30) , where you can buy slabs of different types of chocolate. Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? Los Angeles, only because it is a city that you can’t really explore on foot. I like walking around cities, but Los Angeles is completely dominated by cars.
