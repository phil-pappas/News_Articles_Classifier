In 2015-16 the Victorian Government has invested $20 billion in major transport infrastructure and a further $5.4 billion to health and education to create more jobs and grow our economy.\" \n\"Our recent brand overhaul to Brand Victoria will also ensure Victoria and its magnificent capital Melbourne -- remain the envy of the world when it comes to its economy, its cultural diversity, world class events and liveability,\" said Rowell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T05:14:22.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
