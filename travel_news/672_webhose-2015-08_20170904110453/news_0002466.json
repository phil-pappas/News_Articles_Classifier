Credit: flickr.com/ Ian Mackenzie \nAccording to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, the negative effect of the new visa regulations are temporary and will be resolved. \nRamaphosa was responding to questions in Parliament on Wednesday. \n\"What we are going through is just a temporary problem, we are going to resolve this problem. I am absolutely sure about that,\" Ramaphosa said according to the Mail & Guardian . \nRamaphosa will lead the inter-ministerial task team that has been set up to review the visa regulations. \n\"We are going to try and find a rational and implementable method of bringing about a balance so that we do not sacrifice our security but at the same time we also deal with the negative economic impact that has been brought about,\" he said. \nHe added that government is concerned about job losses and will try to stem them. \n\"If there is a government that is concerned about jobs in the country, it is the Jacob Zuma government.\" \nLast week the Department of Home Affairs defended the child visa laws implemented in June, saying that they're not impractical or onerous. \nMeanwhile the Democratic Alliance has said that the new visa laws have killed almost 1000 job opportunities .
