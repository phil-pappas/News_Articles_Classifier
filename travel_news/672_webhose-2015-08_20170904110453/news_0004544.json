A company of 12 performers and a choreographer have travelled from New Delhi in India to join 40 dancers drawn from Asian dance groups across Scotland. Together they will deliver ‘A Bollywood Love Story’ of glitz, glamour and colour.\nMaking a first visit to Edinburgh, the impressive Changxing Lotus Dragon Dance Folklore Group will tell a story – through dance and music – of a great dragon emerging from a pond covered in beautiful lotus flowers. The legend has been presented in China for many years to help promote the prospect of good crops and wider prosperity.\nOther Tattoo first-timers will include the United States Air Force Honour Guard with a dynamic display of precision drill. Appearing at the Tattoo for a third time is the Citadel Regimental Band and Pipes. This prestigious military college is based in Charleston in South Carolina; slightly closer to home and renowned worldwide for the excellence of its traditional fiddle-based music, the UK’s most northerly community of Shetland will once again be represented at the Tattoo. The Shetland Fiddlers – Hjaltibonhoga – will feature 40 players each evening, aged 14 to 60, exemplifying an aural tradition of fiddling; a tradition that has been sustained so successfully across the generations.\nEach evening over 70 of the finest highland dancers from Australia, United States, Canada, New Zealand and Scotland will present a stunning display. This year’s dance piece is choreographed by former World Champion Aileen Robertson, the Tattoo’s Dance Director, in an item designed to complement the theme of ‘East Meets West’.\nSource:-Visit Britain", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:45:55.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
