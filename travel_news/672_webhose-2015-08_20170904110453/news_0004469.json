The new daily service, Etihad 's second between the two cities, will touch down at Melbourne Airport on Sunday for the first time. It creates an extra 2296 seats on the popular route each week, and will further strengthen Victoria's impressive $20.6 billion tourism and major events industry. The double-daily Boeing 777-300ER service is another opportunity for Victoria to strengthen its global appeal as a place to visit. Improved freight handling capacity also provides greater opportunity for trade between Victoria and the Middle East. Etihad has flown to Melbourne since 2009 and has become a well-known brand in Victoria. The Airline holds naming rights at Docklands Stadium, and sponsors the A-League club, Melbourne City. Melbourne Airport is Australia's second largest, home to 25 international airlines. More than 32 million people passed through the terminals last financial year, including 8.37 million international travellers. \" Etihad 's decision to operate a new service is a ringing endorsement of Victoria and a sign we are heading in the right direction.\" said John Eren, Minister for Tourism and Major Events. \"With new flights to Melbourne, more people will explore Victoria's amazing attractions and attend our great events, which will grow our economy and support jobs. Victoria's tourism stocks are strong under the Andrews Labor Government, and we want to grow it further.\" -Ends- About The Victorian Government Business Office (VGBO) Established in 1997, the Victorian Government Business Office, Dubai (VGBO) is operated by the State Government of Victoria to help promote Victorian trade and investment in the Middle East, Africa and Turkey.
