In fact, some of us are already working in this field without even realising it. This is the business of hitting targets, meeting the needs of clients, planning and organising resources and ensuring projects stay within budget and are completed on time. It is challenging, to say the least – strong leadership skills are non-negotiable – and you need an eye for detail and must work effectively under pressure. Basically, the buck stops with you. But when matched with the right project, being a PM can be an incredibly fulfilling career, and having a string of successful projects on your CV can also provide a significant career boost. Sam Barnes is a digital project management consultant based in Berkshire, and has been in this field for more than decade. He went into project management by accident but says it was the best professional move he could have made. “Being involved in a project and having a key role in its management from the initial planning stages all the way through to delivery is incredibly rewarding,” says Barnes. “I started out as a web developer, writing code, and I loved it, but I started to get frustrated by how my work was coming into me from account and digital project managers. “They were managing the clients well, but without much thought for how I was going to make their promises into a reality. So I started suggesting a few tweaks here and there that would make things more straightforward for me and the rest of the production team, while resulting in better and faster delivery. I get an same enormous satisfaction from seeing a project through from an idea into a reality “My managers took these suggestions on, and those changes proved to be effective. Little did I realise, but I’d just taken my first step towards becoming a digital project manager.” Soon Barnes was being taken into client meetings to cut through the technological jargon. “Then, one day, I found myself alone in a client meeting talking about more than just tech. Soon after that, I wrote my last line of code and became a full-time project manager. That was more than 10 years ago – but I still get the same enormous satisfaction from seeing a project through from an idea into a reality, while running things in a such a way that means I have both happy production teams and well-satisfied clients.” Project management is all about being supremely organised and constantly being able to see the whole picture. “You might be speaking to someone at management level in a blue chip company one minute, and the office junior the next,” says Barnes. “You’ve got to have the emotional intelligence to not just be able to talk to people at every strata of the business, but to also effectively translate the needs of one to the other.” He describes being a project manager as a career that speaks loudly to the highly organised – people who take as much trouble arranging a family holiday to make sure everyone has a great time as they do the professional aspects of their life. “These are highly transferable skills,” he adds. “You can take them across any industry and as long as you get the end result – a project completed to everyone’s satisfaction – you’ll feel the same pride of having orchestrated a job well done, no matter what the area you’ve done it in.” FIVE CAREERS PEOPLE WITH PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILLS EXCEL AT: 1.
