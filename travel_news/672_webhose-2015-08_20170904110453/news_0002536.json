This picture shows the property nestled in its huge vineyard\nA 'quinta' is a lodge run by a wine producer - and this one belongs to one of Portugal's best. And the views from the hotel are breathtaking\nFor wine lovers it's a destination box that cries out to be ticked. A 'quinta' is a lodge run by a wine producer - and this one belongs to one of Portugal's best.\nAnd the produce is served inside, of course.\n 2 Next Welcome to tandem surfing: Incredible acrobatic duo throw...

Then there's the journey to get there - a joy in itself.\nMy girlfriend Gersende and I take the train there from Porto, where we've spent a couple of days quaffing fine port and wine and being gobsmacked by the city's wondrous charm and beauty.\nThe train is very noisy, but the views on the journey breathtaking.\nFor an hour the line winds through rolling countryside, then descends very rapidly to the banks of the Douro river. Now's the time to put the holiday read away and gaze out of the window.\nThe line hugs the river, which snakes through dramatic, vineyard-laden hills on both sides. The fact that this is a Unesco heritage site is no surprise at all.\nThe Douro Valley is a Unesco heritage site, which comes as no great surprise. Pictured is the wonderful for-hire yacht run by Douro a vela\nPooling resources: Guests at Quinta Nova can take a dip among the vines. Ted Thornhill wets his toes\nMailOnline Travel's bedroom is pleasingly homely with great views of the terrace and valley\nIt's dreamy, but we have to be wide awake for Ferrao, the stop that's nearest Quinta Nova, because there are no announcements to alert passengers about upcoming stations. (If you go, gather your belongings and be poised after Regua.)\nWe're the only two people who disembark and one of the Quinta's chefs is there on the platform to meet us and drive us up the twisty road to the property.\nAnd what a place.\nIt's a true haven.\nInside there's a restaurant - called Conceitus - two huge living rooms and a bar and shop, all decorated in a cosy country home manor, complete with creaky wooden floorboards. Think Laura Ashley with chefs and an epic wine cellar.\nOur cosy bedroom has a scintillating view down to the terrace and valley.\nThere's a downside, I exclaim - the tea and coffee paraphernalia doesn't include milk.\nBlack-coffee-loving Gersende rolls her eyes at me.\nQuinta Nova has a homely feel. Think Laura Ashley with a few extras thrown in - such as a bar and wine shop\nGuests at Quinta Nova can sip wine on the terrace in the most gorgeous of surroundings\nWe're keen to explore, but decide on lunch first. Our chef/chauffeur had boasted on the journey up that the food at Quinta Nova is getting international recognition.\nIt doesn't disappoint.\nThe philosophy of the chef here is to forage and rustle. Some of this is done in the hotel's very own vegetable patch.\nThe menu is divided into a choice of three (38 euros), four (43) or five courses (50).\nWe opt for three courses and are blown away by the quality.\nFirst up is mushroom soup with bacon that Gersende - who's from Provence and knows a thing or two about cookery - declares is one of the best soups she's ever had.\nQuinta Nova has some excellent port in its cellars - don't leave without trying some\nThe restaurant at Quinta Nova serves Michelin-star standard food, with this mushroom soup hitting the taste sensation heights\nHULL OF A PLEASANT EXCURSION: SAILING ON THE DOURO\nTo complete your appreciation of the Douro Valley you really must sail on the river.\nThe staff at Quinta Nova happily arrange a watery excursion for us with charter firm Douro a Vela.\nWe sit on a big bean bag at the bow in a zen-like state of relaxation as terraced vineyards slip by on the hills either side.\nWe are only on the boat (pictured) for an hour, but it's possible to take longer trips - up to a day in duration, complete with lunch on board.\nThere's also an option to stay the night on board.\nDouro a Vela also offer guided tours to farmhouses with wine tastings - and even lay on hotel and airport transfers from Porto to the Douro.\nIt's creamy and delicate and rich with flavour.\nNext is a wonderfully rustic cod, tomato and aubergine dish, followed by ice cream and apple pie with berries that frankly sends us in to raptures.\nWhatever they're paying the chef, it's not enough.\nThe service is impeccable, too. As is the wine - a crisp, balanced white made right on the doorstep.\nFeeling full to bursting we decide to explore the vineyard and grounds.\nBeing ready with the camera is an absolute must here - it's total lens bait.\nWe wander through the tree-lined grounds where other guests are sipping wine and gazing at the scenery but keep on going and embark on a circular tour of the vineyards surrounding Quinta Nova.\nBoats chug along the river far below us as we stroll. It's idyllic.\nWe arrive back an hour later and plunge into the pool to cool off. Bliss.\nThe only impediment to relaxation is constantly feeling the need to take pictures.\nLater, as the gloaming envelopes the hotel we decide to try some of the hotel's port stocks.\nWe descend from our room to the hotel bar but find no one there. And there's no one at reception.\nEventually we snare the attention of a waitress who's on her way up to the restaurant and ask her for some of the good stuff.\nIt's service I would describe as rustic. The main focus, understandably, is the dinner service.\nQuinta Nova can be reached by train from Porto, with the journey being spectacular once the line reaches the riverside\nTOP TIPS ON WHERE TO EAT, DRINK AND SLEEP IN PORTO If you visit Quinta Nova it's very likely you'll pass through Porto on your way there. Here are some top tips on how best to spend your time in the city.\nPort tasting\nPop into Calem for a fascinating tour and a port tasting. There's even a video presentation inside an empty barrel\nPortugal is the home of port - and there's no better place to learn more about this unique, fortified red wine - mainly by quaffing the stuff, of course - than at the oldest port house in the world, Kopke.\nIt was established in 1638 and makes some remarkable liquor. In Vila Nova De Gaia, across the river from Porto, is the three-storey Kopke House. A mecca for port lovers. We indulge in one of its port and chocolate tastings, where its ports - including an LBV 2009, rose, and 10-year-old white - are matched with exquisite chocolates.\nIts shop, meanwhile, stocks an intriguing range of bottles, including some that date back to the 1930s. I highly recommend setting aside some holiday money for the visit here.\nWe also pop into the Calem port house, founded in 1859, a hundred yards along for a tour of the cellars. It's fascinating, with a very knowledgeable guide explaining the history of port and how it's made. You even get to watch a video about port inside one of the giant (empty) barrels. Again, a tasting here is essential - Calem also makes some excellent port.\nVisit www.sogevinus.com for more information.\nEating and drinking\nMost of Porto is a Unesco heritage site and impossibly beautiful. Everywhere you go there are tourists taking pictures, with so many cameras clicking it sounds like a swarm of cicadas\nWhen it comes to sunsets, those that take place over Porto and Gaia take some beating\nDOP\nIf you crave a restaurant that assembles virtuoso fodder, serves top-end wine and throws in faultless service to match, look no further than DOP, the sister restaurant of the famed DOC. The row of chairs in the toilet puzzles me, though. Visit ruipaula.com for more information.\nTraca\nWe stop here - actually just opposite the above-mentioned DOP - for a luncheon outside in the sunshine and drool within seconds of the menu being presented to us. I opt for boar loin with foie gras, laced with chocolate, and shoestring potatoes that sends my taste buds into a state of wild celebration. Don't visit Porto without first clicking here: www.restaurantetraca.com .\nA Grade\nHidden down a narrow alley near the river, A Grade looks like a greasy cafe, with cheap chairs and tables and a dirty awning. Don't be put off. It serves great food and the wine is a treat.\nAddress: R. de São Nicolau 9, 4050-298\nMiss 'Opo\nThis is very special indeed. Hip, friendly and amazing value. A guest house, bar and restaurant where great wine costs £1.90 a glass and the cooking is deliciously homely. Visit www.missopo.com for more.\nSleeping\nGuest House Duoro\nHere you'll find social media-baiting views from gorgeous river-side rooms, chatty and charming husband and wife owners and a breathtaking breakfast spread that includes a kind of fruit sculpture. A superb place to rest your head.\nVisit guesthousedouro.com for more information.\nSunsets\nFor stunning views of the next sunset, head to rooftop bar Porto Cruz Space and relish the moment.\nExploring\nMost of Porto is a Unesco heritage site and impossibly beautiful. Everywhere you go there are tourists taking pictures, with so many cameras clicking it sounds like a swarm of cicadas. Walk the bridge between Porto and Gaia for extra-stunning views. Then take the cable car down for more Instagram angles.\nAfter sipping some epic ports it's time for more foraged fodder - and it's almost as brilliant as lunch.\nThough it doesn't quite touch the heavens, as lunch did, we're still moderately bowled over.\nA refreshing tuna carpaccio is followed by lamb carre with sweet potatoes and fennel - just the way your mother would make it, but better - and then millionaire shortbread with melon sorbet and berries.\nThe Quinta Nova red wine we wash it down with is equally pleasing.\nThe following day the agenda is a satisfying breakfast buffet and a wondrous trip along the river on a yacht to nearby Pinhao, where we'll catch a train back to Porto.\nThe staff at Quinta Nova happily arrange this watery excursion with charter firm Douro a Vela and drive us down to the river where the boat is moored by Ferrao train station.\nWe sit on a big bean bag at the bow in a zen-like state of relaxation as terraced vineyards slip by on the hills either side.\nOne of the crew hands us a couple of cheeky glasses of white wine as we near the docking point. We raise our glasses and hope we'll be shipped out here again in the very near future.\nTRAVEL FACTS Quinta Nova has 11 bedrooms costing from £70 with breakfast. Visit www.quintanova.com for more information. To arrange a boat excursion on the river speak to the staff at Quinta Nova or visit www.douro-a-vela.pt .
