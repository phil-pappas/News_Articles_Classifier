All of those aboard the prison bus who were injured were transported to the hospital for injuries that were sustained in the accident, and the bus driver and one of the inmates were hospitalized after the Arizona Department of Corrections prison transport bus hit a semi on Interstate 8. After the collision, the lanes on a portion of Interstate 8 were closed for several hours, according to abc15. According to officials, the prison bus that had 50 inmates on board hit a semi that rolled over and blocked the roadway. According to abc15, The Department of Public Safety said that \"all of the inmates stayed on the scene to help direct traffic and perform first aid on those that were injured.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140714/126845\nOther prison bus accidents have recently occurred, including a fatal wreck in Texas that occurred in January of this year where ten people were killed, including eight inmates and two corrections officers. According to Texas News, the accident occurred when the prison bus \"skidded off an icy West Texas highway, slid down an embankment and collided with a passing freight train.\"\nPatty Kirby , COO and Head of Client Relations, commented on the recent prison bus crash, \"The transportation of inmates is the responsibility of The Department of Corrections, and unfortunately accidents happen, resulting in serious injuries to inmates. Most of the time, inmates are transferred while being shackled, only adding to their injuries. States such as New York , California , Texas , Georgia , and Florida have large prison populations and we have noticed they naturally have more of these incidents.\"\nLegal-Bay, a law cash advance company, reaffirms their dedication to assisting victims involved in prison bus accidents and/or public transportation incidents in New York City or other major cities.
