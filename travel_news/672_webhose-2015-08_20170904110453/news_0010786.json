There are great opportunities to see wildlife while mountain biking in remote areas. \nDon’t miss: The seafood. Exceptional fish, especially trout ( trucha in Spanish), rich ceviches. Meat is also popular, and if you are curious, you must try the popular guinea pig. \nDon’t bother: Trying to find local wines; Chile and Argentina are better options. Ecuador excels in natural and biodiverse landscapes and has a great locally brewed beer called Pilsner. \nCoolest souvenir: New friends from the tour, great photos, shopping at the Otovalo Market (the largest in South America), a bruised rib from rappelling down gorgeous waterfalls. \nWorth a splurge: Enjoy a wonderful meal at La Petite Mariscal, named for the popular Quito neighborhood. Also, additional day tours to the Mindo Cloud Forest. \nWish I’d packed: More time. There is so much more to see; the Galapagos Islands must await my next visit. \nOther comments: Allow yourself to slow down; people seem to really enjoy life and meals and spending time together. Within a short distance from the cities, indigenous people can be seen wearing colorful clothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T02:23:13.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
