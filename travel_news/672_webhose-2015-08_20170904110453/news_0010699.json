The company has reportedly completed more than 3.5 million rides and counting since it set its sights on the Houston area in July 2013. It's been operating in Houston for about 18 months. Not surprisingly, some of the city's shortest wait times are in central areas, such as downtown, Midtown, Washington Avenue and the Galleria. However, there are a few exceptions that also have relatively short wait times, such as the 77515 ZIP code in Angleton, Texas, which is in Brazoria County southwest of Houston, and the 77328 ZIP code for the Cleveland region. Some places where wait times are on average 12 minutes or longer include the Baytown area zip code of 77523, the Galveston-area ZIP code of 77554 and the 77375 ZIP code of the Tomball area, according to Uber's maps. A key factor in the response times, Uber claims, is the amount of drivers in the area. Densely populated parts of town, such as inside the Loop, are more likely to have a higher number of drivers at the ready compared to the 77423 ZIP code of Brookshire, Texas, for example. Take a look at Uber's heat maps to see how it's driver partners and wait times stack up. The San Francisco-based company did not reveal how many drivers it has in the Houston market. Uber also revealed some other interesting statistics for its Houston service. For example, the average cost of a ride from the Third Ward to downtown is around $6. Uber recently revealed its plans to launch its food-delivery service, UberEats, in the Houston market through a job posting on its website. \nGet Houston Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:35:15.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
