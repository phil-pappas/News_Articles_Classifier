Starting from Delhi, it covers about 60 cities, in 25 states, and 20,000 kilometers in 100 days, resulting in 50 mostly authentic recipes from different corners. \nTitle: India On My PlatterAuthor: Saransh GoilaPrice: `295Publisher: Om Books International \nTwo of the most common wishes in the world are travel and good food. In his latest book, ­celebrity chef and food ­consultant Saransh Goila has tried to serve both, as he lives his dream of discovering not just ­recipes but also new places. \nThe book is his record of the ­delicious food journey he ­undertakes, starting from Delhi, ­covering about 60 ­cities, in 25 states, and 20,000 ­kilometers in 100 days, resulting in 50 mostly authentic ­recipes from different corners. \nThe recipes are simply listed and in a manner which is easy to follow. From yellow daal to Hyderabadi Gobhi Mussalam Biryani and more, there is a lot to choose from. The ­writing style is simple. However, there is no table of contents, which means one has to sift through the whole book for the favourite recipe or earmark the one you’d want to try. \nEach of the ­regional dishes is a ­specialty of that place. The ­preparation style, the ingredients and the recipes are original and sourced from those who have been making it for generations. However, some have the writer’s twist too. Nevertheless, the culinary experiments listed are worth a shot. \nAs for the travel bit, well, it reads more like a diary entry with a great deal of personal touch and individual impressions. Not a ­brilliant ­travelogue, but the chef’s experience of ­cooking with everyone— from the dhabawalas to the royals— is a fresh breath of air.
