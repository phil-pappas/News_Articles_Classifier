Here, a primer on the UW defense:\nDEFENSIVE LINE\nEnd\nTaniela Tupou , sr., 6-2, 288\nJarett Finau , sr., 6-3, 274\nShane Bowman , rs-fr., 6-3, 273\nJason Scrempos , fr., 6-6 280\nBryce Sterk , fr., 6-4, 234\nTackle\nElijah Qualls , so., 6-1, 311\nGreg Gaines , rs-fr., 6-1, 310\nVita Vea , rs-fr., 6-5, 340\nRicky McCoy , fr., 6-2, 307\nMost Read Stories ESPN video: Percy Harvin opens up about what went wrong in Seattle Amazon angst: from traffic to housing, we’re all worked up It’s election time.

Versatility is key here, with guys like Dissly, Tupou, Bowman and Johnson capable of shifting around the line (and even into coverage at times), depending on the defensive alignment. That’s becoming more important as defensive coordinators try to get creative against spread offenses. Dissly was dominant for much of the spring, and Qualls looks like he’ll take over for Danny Shelton as the main man in the middle. We’ll probably see more guys rotating more often this season. Potoa’e, listed at 270 on the updated roster, is the one true freshman who seems most likely to play on the D-line; McCoy could push for time as well.\n…\nTravis Feeney reads the screen perfectly and drops UCLA’s Jordon James for a 5-yard loss in the first half at Husky Stadium.

That’s no small task. Getting Feeney back from shoulder surgery will help; he’s the only returning starter on the front seven. I’m curious to see where Littleton ends up; he was a starting D-end two years ago. I wonder if he might be an option at Buck. Mathis experimented at Buck in the spring and it’ll be interesting to see if he sticks there. Bierria’s expected back after missing spring with an undisclosed injury; he filled in capably on the weak side when Shaq shifted to running back last year. Lawyer adds a steady presence there, too. Note: The freshman position projections are my best estimates. We’ll see where they line up this weekend.\n*denotes walk-on\n…\nUW’s Budda Baker (left) delivers a hit on Washington State receiver Dom Williams in the end zone on fourth down during the Apple Cup.

A year ago, the secondary was UW’s biggest question mark, with three openings and virtually no proven options to fill those holes. Entering this fall, the secondary looks like the strength of the defense, if not the entire team. Baker and Jones are secure in their starting roles. They are emerging stars in the Pac-12 — and we should even see Baker on offense and special teams this season. The other two spots should provide quality competition in camp. I could see any of the strong safeties/rovers starting: Walker started the first eight games last season before tearing his ACL; Clay might be the most fundamentally sound of the bunch; and McIntosh and Turner both turned heads (and torsos) in the spring as the team’s two newest enforcers. Similarly, Gardenhire, King and Hale are all viable candidates to win the other corner job. Gardenhire was one of the breakout performers in the spring. King, who sat out spring ball, is intriguing; he’s more of a natural free safety who played out of position most of last year at rover but will get a shot to play corner this fall. Probably more than any of the freshmen, I’m curious to see Joyner in camp. The hunch here is he’ll play a role on this team this season.\n…\nKicker Cameron Van Winkle, left, and punter Korey Durkee return for UW this season. (The Seattle Times) SPECIALISTS\nKicker\nCameron Van Winkle , jr., 5-10, 184\nTristan Vizcaino , so., 6-2, 205\nPunter\nKorey Durkee , sr., 6-4, 247\nVizcaino\nLong snapper\nRyan Masel , sr., 6-1, 220\nLuke Hutchison , so., 6-2, 225\nOutlook: Not much concern here. Van Winkle was excellent in his first season as the primary place-kicker, converting 20 of 24 field-goal attempts. Durkee, we know, has a booming leg, and he seemed to get the hang (see what I did there?) of Petersen’s preferred rugby-style punting as the season rolled on.\nAdam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
