Why? Well, the origins are obscure. Some say it started when a spat broke out beside a vegetable stall in the 1940s. What's certain is that it's the world's biggest food fight and a major tourist draw. To ensure it doesn't turn into \"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!\" there are strict rules in place. No throwing tomatoes that aren't squashed and no throwing anything that isn't a tomato. There's no dress code, but old T-shirts, perhaps accessorized with goggles seem to be the thing. There's a huge after party too. The booze is advertised as cheap -- probably even cheaper if the order's a Bloody Mary. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from CNN Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:15:00.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
