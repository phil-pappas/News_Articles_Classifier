PUBLISHED: 13:45, Mon, Aug 17, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:06, Mon, Aug 17, 2015 GETTY Opting for a cruise can take all of the stress out of travelling \nThe Baltic \nTwo weeks will get you all the way to Russia and back, calling at elegant Scandinavian capitals and cities that look like they're straight out of a Hans Christian Anderson 's fairytale. \nYou can see Hans himself - or a fabulous statue - in Denmark's capital Copenhagen, just across the road from Tivoli Gardens, while Sweden's capital, Stockholm, is a series of islands with hop-on tourist boats that take you to all the museums and shopping areas. \nSt Petersburg has The Hermitage, with 1,000 rooms packed with Catherine the Great's treasures, but two of the prettiest ports are Finland's capital, Helsinki, with its harbour markets, and Estonia's \nTallinn, with medieval walls and gorgeous Orthodox Christian churches. Two weeks will get you all the way to Russia and back \nRound-Britain \nYou get a very different perspective when you sail into a city - particularly one with a waterfront as exciting as Liverpool and its Three Graces. \nMost cruise lines offer round-Britain cruises these day because they are increasingly popular and sell out quickly. \nIn Liverpool you hardly have to leave the Albert Docks there is so much to see, for instance Tate Liverpool, The Beatles Story, Liverpool Museum and the city's Maritime Museum. \nOther classic ports include Newcastle, which has an equally lively and regenerated waterfront along the River Tyne, Dublin, where you can tour the Guinness Storehouse or Jameson Distillery and \nEdinburgh - although ships dock at Queensferry - where you can visit the castle, climb Arthur's Mount or shop on Princes Street. \nNorwegian fjords \nMost Britons' first cruise is either to the Mediterranean or the Norwegian fjords and if you can't stand the heat in summer then Scandinavia is a like a breath of fresh air. \nMake sure you get to see Bergen, where the UNESCO-listed Bryggen Wharf has colourful timber houses and cobbled street. \nFlam, in Aurlandsfjord, is just a tiny village but you can kayak in the still waters, cycle around the fjord or take the famous scenic railway into the mountains. \nKristiansund is a pretty seaside town with a slightly yachty atmosphere and some good homeware shops for those who like the Scandinavia look. \nAnd if you can get on a fjords cruise that also takes in Oslo grab it =AD- Norway's capital has the fascinating Viking Ships Museum, Viking gold in its National History Museum and a whole gallery \nfull of work by painter Edvard Munch - including The Scream. \nThe Mediterranean \nThe Western Mediterranean is within easy reach of Britain after a few sea days navigating the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian peninsular. \nYou may get a day in Portugal's capital Lisbon, where trams hurtle along the narrow streets up the hill to the castle or along the river Tagus to the Discoveries Monument at Belem, or perhaps \nyou will call at Cadiz - the Moorish port towards the end of Spain's Atlantic coast - before arriving in the Med.
