Photos View Gallery \nPerhaps nowhere better illustrates the ever-changing topography and contrasts in the environment of the world's largest sand island than the exquisite expanse of nothingness at one of about 30 sand blows. \nKirrar Sand Blow - one of the stops on The Discovery Group's two-day Fraser Island Experience - is an impressively beautiful and tranquil spot (although I couldn't help wishing for a toboggan to whoosh down one of the hills, screaming \"yahoo!\"). \nThe sand blows - mostly on Fraser Island's east coast - are formed through the gradual shifting of sands across the island over time at rates of up to 1m a year. \nAs a result, they are ever-changing and constantly moving, as is the entire island. \nThe massive sand deposits that make up the World Heritage-Listed island act as an ongoing record of climate and sea-level changes over the past 700,000 years. \nJust when my husband and I thought we had \"done\" Fraser Island on several trips - from one-day escorted tours to independent four-wheel-driving and resort stays, along comes this tour to blow my well-travelled smugness out of the water. \nWe were pleasantly surprised to discover new points of interest we hadn't encountered before, so that we were viewing the island with fresh eyes alongside our German, Catalonian, Australian, English and Dutch counterparts. \nWhile we had marvelled at the serenity of Wanggoolba Creek from the boardwalk down from Central Station, we had never taken the moderately easy walk from there to Pile Valley. \nFor the first time, we rock-hopped from the beach to the top of Indian Head to be mesmerised by humpback whales frolicking offshore and to take in the glorious view towards the other volcanic plug at Waddy \nPoint. Until now, we had never picnicked under the trees at Cathedrals or visited the small community of Happy Valley, where we stayed in a comfortable private cabin and dined and shared good conversation at Satinay Bar and Restaurant. \nAll our previous visits to Fraser had originated from Hervey Bay with the vehicular ferry at River Heads. \nBut this time, we came in from the southern end at Inskip Point and experienced the thrill of driving from the southern tip of the island up Seventy-Five Mile Beach. \nAnd though we had encountered sand blows before, we had never seen the beauty of Kirrah Sand Blow on the island until this trip. \nOf course, we were also able to reconnect with some old favourites: the Maheno wreck that always appeals to the arty photographer in me; the Coloured Sands of Rainbow Beach bathed in late-afternoon sunlight that sets the cliffs ablaze; and an uncrowded Eli Creek, where an international backpacker entertained us with multiple handstands into the cool waters. \nAnd Lake McKenzie - one of 40 perched lakes on the island that make up almost half of the world's perched dune lakes - is always a must-see. \nThe perched lake formed above the water table when compacted organic matter and sand became a catchment for rain in its basin-like area. \nFar from the madding crowd of sunbathers and swimmers, you can always find a spot to quietly contemplate the majesty of Lake McKenzie - where powdery white sand leads into clear water, extending into a turquoise foreshore and deeper blue of the greater lake, all framed by green bushland and topped by blue sky accentuated by white, fluffy clouds. \nAnd if you're lucky, you might also spot in the bushland some of the foxtail ferns that our experienced guide and driver \"Max\" had been telling us about. \nThe plant is so named because as the fern's furry \"flower\" dies off, its brown colour makes it look like a fox's tail. \nMax also tells us that when missionaries first came to Fraser Island (\"K'Gari\", as the Butchella Aboriginal People called it, meaning \"paradise\"), about 200 Aborigines were living there in summer. But in winter, when fish were especially plentiful, numbers would swell to 2000 as other members of the Gubbi Gubbi tribe came over from the mainland to the more than 100 freshwater lakes and creeks. \nTake in the two-day Fraser Island Experience with The Discovery Group and you, too, will believe in Paradise Found. \nBY THE NUMBERS \n* 123km in length and 22km at its widest point. \n* It covers more than 160,000 ha. \n* World Heritage Listed in 1992 for its natural and cultural heritage. \n* The only place in the world where rainforests grow on sand dunes at elevations over 200m. \n* Home to more than 230 species of birds, 25 species of mammals and whales breaching and frolicking just off the beach from July to October. \n* Formed during the last ice age when waves and ocean currents from the continental shelf of NSW and southern Queensland deposited sand into dunes parallel to the coast. Onshore winds began the march inland of a sequence of dunes as they overlapped other older dunes. \n* Fraser Island and Cooloola are remnants of sand masses that once lay 30km east. \n* While Fraser has a permanent population of perhaps as little as 200 people to 600 living in and around seven townships, more than 350,000 people from all over the world visit the island each year. \n* Its sandy beaches are not only a certified highway subject to speed limits and road rules, they also become a runway in several areas with orange \"witches' hats\" designating the no-go zone for people and cars. \n* The Discovery Group, based in Noosaville, is a multi-award-winning eco-tourism business offering one and two-day adventure tours from the Sunshine Coast.

We appear to be the first to experience this natural rainforest walk this morning after an 8am start from Happy Valley in our comfortable, purpose-built 20-seater Warrior 4WD vehicle. The mild winter morning, showers the day before and mottled light streaming through the canopies make for a magical start to our walk. While the big picture is fascinating, we are careful not to miss the small. So our gaze moves up, down and around from the tallest of trees touching the sky to the orange toadstools at our feet. Palm fronds glisten with raindrops and waterlogged fallen tree trunks seem to have sprouted more bright-green moss. The creek water that appeared at first to be milky-coloured from above we now realise is reflecting the colour of the sand and is indeed clear, cool and drinkable. We feel the texture of the satinay (also known as the Fraser turpentine tree. The satinay and brushbox forests on the island represent the best and most extensive stands of their type in the world). We hug a kauri pine (this area of the island was never logged and is pure rainforest). We step over the dead palm fronds and leaf litter that now add mulch to the forest floor to begin fertilising new growth. The strangler vines we like to call \"Tarzan\" vines become more prolific as we head further into this jungle. The thick forest has swallowed any human voices from our group in front and behind us. Our new world is silent except for the two finches we try to spot flitting from shrub to shrub and the muffled sounds of our own tramping over wet sand and fallen leaves on the well-maintained path. The sentinel-like piccabeen palms stand straight and tall with outstretched \"arms\" of leafy green. As we head up the steps towards the roadway, leaving the forest floor behind, we make one last effort to fill our lungs with the purest of oxygen, courtesy of Mother Nature. - SHIRLEY SINCLAIR \nTOP SUNSHINE COAST STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T02:36:51.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
