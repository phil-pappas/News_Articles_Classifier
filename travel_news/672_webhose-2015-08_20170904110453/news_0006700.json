Tony Berendsen, star guide extraordinaire, leads attendees on an exploration of the skies, without having to venture too far afield. It’s one of the ways the North Shore has expanded activities for families — after sunset. \nWarm days and moderate nights are part of the formula for why people spend far more time outdoors in summer at Lake Tahoe than during ski season. And there are plenty of activities for families during the daytime: swimming, boating, hiking, biking, geocaching, as well as a wealth of beautiful mountain scenery in which to play. In past years, when dinner’s over, family time options have thinned out, aside from the occasional outdoor movie and continued play in the moonlight. \nSouth has indoor focus \nIn Tahoe’s popular South Shore, indoor activities include the cinema and a skateboard park; however, families have to brave the crowds and traffic. But the North Shore’s slower pace and outdoor focus are a lure to families who want to take advantage of staying outside and together as long as possible. \nIn recent years, growing opportunities on the North Shore (especially in the Truckee area) for families to extend their outdoor time in the evening means the kids are less bored and far more likely to drop into bed exhausted at the end of a long mountain summer day. And nighttime activities aren’t limited to land, ranging from guided astronomy tours to kayak trips on the lake to street fairs and even old-school miniature golf. \n“I’ve seen a lot of growth in recent years for family evening activities,” says Kevin Hickey of Tahoe Adventure Co. “Our summer sunset, full moon and star tours kayak trips often sell out. And Truckee is really hitting its stride and becoming a destination in its own right, and not just somewhere to pass through on your way to Lake Tahoe.” \nAdventurous families can take to the lake by kayak on a guided tour, and get a very different nighttime view — Lake Tahoe’s landscape from the water side. “The tours are great for beginners as well as more experienced kayakers who find something new in paddling at night,” says Hickey. \nSeeing stars in new way \nThe absence of city lights and the temperate summer weather combine to make a perfect opportunity to take a Tahoe Star Tour of the night sky above the Sierra. Land-based attendees get a Star Tour Astronomy presentation, a laser tour of the stars and telescopic viewing through computerized Celestron telescopes. What makes it extra special: comfortable seating, fire pits, outdoor heaters and blankets, and complimentary treats (coffee, hot chocolate and s’mores). But if you can’t tear yourself away from the lake, there are also star tours offered by kayak, where the silence on the water and feeling of being away from it all allow a different experience. \nWeekly night events — from the street-fair vibe of Truckee Thursdays to Tahoe Donner Music on the Porch (Wednesdays), Bluesdays at Squaw Valley (Tuesdays) and Friday Fun Nights at Northstar — let families choose more than one special night of the week to celebrate. A host of outdoor movie nights, whether at summertime ski villages or hotels, round out other nights of the week. \nExpanded options at Tahoe hotels, aside from day camp activities for kids, allow families to continue the fun into evening hours. At the Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe, adventure and luxury go together with the hotel’s indoor campout package ($100 per child) that includes a tent in your room complete with feather bed, s’mores kit, camp light and coloring book. Beginning in the later afternoon, kids can consult with an expert s’mores-ologist at the fire pit to create gooey gourmet treats. Families are more than welcome at the Backyard Bar & BBQ, which keeps the casual summer vibe going into the evening. The restaurant’s special Friday night family cookouts include lawn games and live entertainment. \nBeach party \nThe private beach of the Mourelatos Lakeshore Resort stays active at night, with families telling stories around the three fire pits, playing pingpong or enjoying an outdoor movie on the beach. No shushing in favor of a quieter evening begins until 10 p.m., which is ample time for after-dinner summer enjoyment. \nEven restaurants are getting into the action, with expanded menus to include kid-friendly options that don’t dumb down adult choices. At Burger Me, choosy children can get a standard hamburger or cheeseburger, while Mom and Dad can be more adventurous with bison or Greek-inspired burgers. Cake Tahoe has delicious cupcakes for dessert and stays open late so you can pick your favorite after dinner. \nAs tonight’s Tahoe Star Tour ends, kids chatter with parents and list the constellations and stars they’ve seen, nearly close enough to touch. I overhear a handful of children who beg their dads to stay outside, so they can see more stars. \nNobody is asking about watching TV. \nJill K. Robinson is a freelance writer in Half Moon Bay.
