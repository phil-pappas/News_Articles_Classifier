When the issues could not be resolved during the second act, the performance was suspended.\nAccording to 5th Avenue publicist Bridget Summers, the show could not be completed in part because the numerous child actors in the cast of “Matilda,” based on the popular Roald Dahl novel for young readers, have a strict curfew.\nA Seattle Times reader complained that the delays were handled badly, with audience members left waiting on the street and in the crowded lobby for long periods, without sufficient explanation and updates on what was going on.\nMost Read Stories Wind-whipped wildfire kills 3 firefighters, injures 4 near Twisp No bodies found in wreckage of Bremerton motel Cascadia fault chatters and pops with little quakes When fire chief called for help, and no one was left State cracks down on fraudulent immigration aid 5th Avenue managing director Bernadine C.
