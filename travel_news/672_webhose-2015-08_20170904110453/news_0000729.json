The Embraer 145 was scheduled to fly from Charlotte to Chicago and is arguably the second U.S. commercial flight to make an emergency landing within a span of two days.\nThe pilot of the United Express Flight 5919 followed the apt procedure according to the reports. However, some of the airline passengers complained of headaches and ear problems and were attended by medical responders as soon as the plane landed.\nThere were about 50 passengers on board the United Express flight operated by ExpressJet. The passengers were later transferred to Chicago on a bus â€“ a three hour drive from Indianapolis.\nThe incident took place within a span of two days after a Delta Air Lines flight had to make an emergency landing following a cracked windshield. The flight flew into a storm and was hit by hail and lightning. The Delta flight made a safe landing at Denver International Airport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:07:04.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
