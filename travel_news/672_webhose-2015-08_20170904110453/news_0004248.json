A team from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is coming to help investigate. By JoNel Aleccia Seattle Times health reporter \nAn outbreak of salmonella infections apparently linked to eating pork has expanded in Washington state, with at least 90 people in nine counties reported to have been ill. Six have been hospitalized. \nThe sharp uptick in cases in less than a week and the lack of a clear source has led state health officials to ask the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to send in a special team to help with the investigation. The so-called Epi-Aid group should be in Washington next week, a state Department of Health spokesman said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is also involved in the probe. \nInvestigators say many of the cases appear to be linked to eating pork, or to exposure to raw pork, particularly whole roasted pigs cooked and served at private events. \nThe cases, many of which are in King County, appear to have been caused by the same rare strain of Salmonella bacteria, health officials said. The outbreak is linked to Salmonella I, 4, 5, 12:i:-, a germ that has been emerging nationally but has never before been seen in Washington state.
