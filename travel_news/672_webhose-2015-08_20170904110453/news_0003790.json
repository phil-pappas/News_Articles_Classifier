Featuring team games, coracle polo matches and other fiercely contended competitions, free to watch it takes place along the picturesque stretch of the River Severn at the Ironbridge Rowing Club, Buildwas Road, Ironbridge (TF8 7BJ for those with SatNav). Food and refreshments will be available.\nUsed for thousands of years, Coracles are flat bottomed boats made from woven wood covered in animal skins, or more often nowadays, canvas sewn on and waterproofed with tar or bitumen. They were used for fishing, ferrying and – commonly in Ironbridge – for poaching. Before the advent of the Iron Bridge, they were also used to ferry people and goods from one side of the River Severn to the other.\nSource:-Visit I&T", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:16:41.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
