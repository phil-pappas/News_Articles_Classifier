Valid through Jan. 12, 2016, the deal means travelers will have access to newly renovated guest rooms starting at just $111 USD per night.\nWith renovations completed earlier this year, the hotel has beautifully transformed its 210 guest rooms, on-site restaurant, Concierge Lounge and fitness center into chic spaces that cater to the modern traveler. Visitors can stay connected and entertained with complimentary high-speed Internet access and flat-panel TVs in all rooms while relaxing in beds with down comforters, custom duvets and cotton-rich linens. On-the-go guests will appreciate mini refrigerators with complimentary bottled water, coffee makers and satisfying room service selections to enjoy in their private, cozy sitting areas.\nBoasting an easily accessible location just outside of downtown Rochester, the hotel welcomes leisure travelers from across the border to explore everything the city and its surrounding areas have to offer during an exciting visit to upstate New York. Take the family to a first-class museum, experience the culture of the diverse city with a night downtown or retreat to the pristine shores of Lake Ontario. Finger Lakes Wine Country, Genesee Brew House, Historic Erie Canal/Village of Pittsford and the Waterloo Premium Outlets are other reasons to visit Rochester.\nAfter a day of work or play, visitors can relax at the hotel’s indoor heated pool and sauna or hit the fitness center, complete with cardiovascular equipment and free weights.\nWhether traveling with the family or visiting for business, all guests will enjoy a wide selection of convenient dining opportunities at the hotel as well as close proximity to popular area restaurants. Travelers are invited to start their day right with healthy breakfast options at The Café, open for breakfast, and then return to Images Restaurant & Bar, the hotel’s on-site restaurant, for a wide selection of mouthwatering dishes and refreshing cocktails during lunch or dinner.
