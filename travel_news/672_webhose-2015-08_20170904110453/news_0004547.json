Instead, the plantation-style restaurant procured a new chef, Ishmael Toro (formerly of Miami's Novecento), who's bringing stuff such as mofongo lobster to the menu. \nJust down US-1, Oo-Tray (80900 Overseas Hwy., Islamorada; 305-922-2027; oo-tray.com) aspires to \"global cuisine with a local farm-to-table flavor\" fueled by chef David Matlock, an alum of Thomas Keller's Bouchon in Yountville, Calif. He whips up outside-the-box items such as duck wings with bourbon and caramel; bahn mi sandwiches; and a bone-in pork entree with bacon jam and pineapple chimichurri. The bar is all about whiskey, with esoteric stuff like Willett and Belle Meade bourbon, and Balcones True Blue whiskey from Texas. \nHailing from Key West, Bad Boy Burrito (81868 Overseas Hwy., Islamorada; 305-440-3951) is hidden in the Village Square, a shady alcove behind the Trading Post. It opened last month and offers delicious Cal-Mex-style grub with a Floribbean influence. Try the Key West pink shrimp taco with charred pineapple habanero sauce, or the Baja fish tacos: beer-battered local mahi mahi, shaved cabbage and chipotle aioli. Drinks rock as well, with offering such as local mango smoothies, star fruit juice, and Mexican ice coffee made with dulce de leche. Also in the Village Square alcove sits Urbn Grdn (305-537-6770; urbngrdn.org), a juice bar that moved from US-1 in early July, and crafts juices from South Florida produce. The Katy Pear (kale, pear cucumber, lime) and the Blue Maca (blueberry, banana, vanilla, fresh almond milk, maca) shine. \nJust up the street find Olive Morada (82229 Overseas Hwy., Islamorada; 305-735-4375; olivemorada.com), an olive oil and gourmet emporium that opened in December. They've got 42 oils and balsamic vinegars, but be sure ask for a sample of the Jimmy Buffett special - Persian lime olive oil mixed with coconut white balsamic vinegar, and keep and eye out for other goods, like Key Lime Curd and wild hibiscus flowers in syrup. \nNext door, the Islamorada Beer Company (82229 Overseas Hwy., Islamorada; 305-440-2162; islamoradabeerco.com), which brews upstate and opened its doors here in October, offering flights of brews like their Sandbar Sunday American Wheat Ale, or Channel Marker IPA, a light noted pale ale. \nFor a microbrewery that brews on-site, hit Florida Keys Brewing Company (200 Morada Way, Islamorada; 305-916-5206; floridakeysbrewingco.com), situated off the strip in a row of funky warehouses. Though it opened just five months ago, the tasting room already feels homey, and the brews are gaining local love. Try the Honey Bottomed Blonde, made with local Keys honey, or the Hogfish Amber, an American amber with floral and citrus notes. They've even occasionally age their Run Aground Brown ale in rum barrels for two months - if you're lucky they'll have some in stock. \nOf course if you just have to get your fix of \"old\" Islamorada, then belly up to the bar during sunset at Lorelei Restaurant & Cabana Bar (96 Madeira Rd, Islamorada; 305-664-2692; loreleicabanabar.com), watch the fishing charters pull in, and witness why this hamlet is known as a \"quaint little drinking town with a fishing problem.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:19:20.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
