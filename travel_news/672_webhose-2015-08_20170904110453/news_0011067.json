And that may be even more incentive for hotels to get creative, because \"there are fewer opportunities for additional sources of revenue,'' Hanson says.\nFees and surcharges vary from hotel to hotel, and the costs may change from day to day. While some fees have existed for decades, one of the newest charges is paying extra to guarantee a particular room, such as one with a king rather than two queen-size beds. Other fees are more common in a particular property type or market. Visitors staying in a Las Vegas resort, for instance, may encounter a charge for being able to check into their room early.\nResort fees, which might cover the use of a gym or swimming pool, are among the most common fees at resort properties, and tend not to be optional. Some consumer advocates say that such mandatory charges should be included in the listed room rate.\n\"I don't mind fees, in general, as long as it's for optional services,'' says Brett Snyder, president of Cranky Concierge, a travel-assistance service. \"Where I see the greatest issue is when there are mandatory fees that you can't avoid, but (which) aren't required to be included in the advertised price.''\nRosanna Maietta, spokeswoman for the American Hotel & Lodging Association, said in an emailed statement that \"service fees are common practice in retail and commerce, from banking and mobile fees to extra charges for event tickets.''\nShe added that \"in the hotel industry, mandatory resort fees, often called amenity fees, are fully disclosed at the time of booking and remain transparent whether consumers book online or with the hotel directly. Moreover, resort fees have steadily declined over the past decade. According to a recent survey, a mere 7% of hotels charged mandatory resort fees in 2014.''\nStill, Charlie Leocha, chairman of the advocacy group Travelers United, says that while resort fees are disclosed, they are not necessarily on the first page of a booking site that's listing hotels based on room price. His organization wants regulations to require mandatory fees be added to room rates to give consumers a clearer picture up front of how much they will ultimately pay.\n\"Consumers need to read the fine print on hotel websites, because now the fine print in some cases can increase the cost of the room by 25% to 50%,'' he says. \"If you find a hotel with a resort fee, go back to the original listing and click on a different hotel.''\n18 CONNECT 43 TWEET 44 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1EiuXXQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EiuXXQ&text=Hotels%20on%20track%20to%20collect%20record%20surcharges%20and%20fees%20this%20year%2C%20report%20says&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1EiuXXQ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a1208994d0d9984f275a42c3ba9c8d1c69735982/c=0-249-3193-2650&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635761178008395033-XXX-HOTEL-SCHOOLS003-18439921.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635761178008395033-XXX-HOTEL-SCHOOLS003-18439921.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EiuXXQ&mini=true"], "published": "2015-08-26T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T23:24:04.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
