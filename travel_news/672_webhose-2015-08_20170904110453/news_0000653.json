The last count was done in 2010 when the numbers of great apes had increased by about 26 per cent to 480 from about 380 over seven years.\nBy the 1970s the gorilla population had dwindled to about 250 due to poaching, disease and habitat loss by encroaching human settlement.\nThe theme for Kwita Izina 2015 is “Conserving Now and For the Future”. It has become an annual event based on a centuries-old Rwandan tradition that celebrates the birth of children. Family, friends, and neighbours hold a festive ceremony where mothers and father present their children and reveal the names they have chosen.\nHeld near the Volcanoes National Park’s headquarters, Kwita Izina caps a weeklong conservation festival, with events in Kigali and other locations in Rwanda. Baby gorillas are named by invited guests and then monitored for life by the park’s team of conservationists.\nThe baby gorillas are given names by various Rwandan dignitaries and also invited international guests, who have in the past included former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Hollywood actor Isaiah Washington and Nigerian film star Ramsey Tokunbo Nouah, among others.\nEach baby gorilla’s name highlights the great importance of these treasured jungle creatures to this African nation and the world.\nKundurwanda (love Rwanda), Ndengera (protect me), Kwigira (self-resilience), Inzozi (dreams), Birashoboka (it is possible), Twiyubake (self-reliance), Gikundiro (likeable) and Ihoho (incomparable beauty), are some of the Rwandan names given to gorilla babies in the past.\nAlthough the baby gorillas themselves are not present at the proceedings, a photograph of each is and the event is celebrated with traditional festivities and dances which have attracted as many as 40,000 people.\nBesides visiting Volcanoes National Park for this major annual celebration, visitors can take in guided tours out of Kigali in the days leading up to the gorilla naming festival\nIt is the best time for tourists to visit Rwanda on a trip they can meet national park staff, noted conservationists, attend cultural evenings and a celebration in the tourist hub of Musanze, and tour the little-visited twin lakes Burero and Ruhondo, surrounded by the breathtaking landscape that is a wetland bird habitat and birder’s paradise.\nThe week leading up to the gorilla naming event also includes a business expo highlighting Rwanda’s economic growth and visits to Kinigi Cultural Center where locals exhibit and sell their products such as honey and handicrafts and offer interactive weaving workshops.\nFor more information on Kwita Izina and other activities in Rwanda, visit www.rwandatourism.com .\nPrivate paradise in British Columbia", "external_links": ["http://www.rwandatourism.com/", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T23:40:41.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
