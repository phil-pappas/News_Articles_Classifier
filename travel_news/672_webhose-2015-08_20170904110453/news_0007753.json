The events included BMW Group UK Retailer Conference, the MINI UK Sales Conference, the BMW Group UK Aftersales Conference, and the BMW Group UK Sales and Marketing Conference. \nJames Wilkins, Managing Director said: “This is absolutely what we’re designed for. It combined all the best bits about Vista.” The Leeds and London-based agency (formerly Logistik Group) has developed a strong partnership with the internationally respected brand, after delivering both their Aftersales and Dealer Budget conferences last year. In addition to Vista executing all planning, logistics, production and AV for the flagship week at Liverpool’s Echo Arena, the company also took the lead on creative conception. Working closely with the brand’s internal stakeholders, Vista’s in-house teams produced tailored content, film and digital support, showcasing their impressive full service offering. Mr Wilkins said: “We think of ourselves as trusted partners rather than an employed agency. This means we put ourselves into colleagues’ shoes, so we really understand their mindsets and ambitions – and then help translate this into real results.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T12:43:29.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
