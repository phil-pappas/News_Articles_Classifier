With Labor Day just around the corner, why not book your tickets to tour the canyon from Las Vegas? Vegas is a great place to start your helicopter tour because you'll get your choice of a landing or air tour. Both of these tours take the same route to the canyon, which means you will fly over the colossal Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. Of course you will end up at the highlight of the journey, the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon itself. While the air-only tours circle the canyon and head back to Vegas, the landing tours stop at the canyon so you can get out and explore the area. Las Vegas Landing Tours While you have a choice in tour types and upgrades, one of the best choices is the deluxe landing tour that departs from the Strip in Vegas. The deluxe tours are superior because they fly on the advanced EcoStar 130 helicopter, plus you'll get free hotel transportation in a limousine. You can take one of these tours on a chopper that flies down to the canyon floor so you can get out near the banks of the Colorado River. As a nice touch, this tour comes with a champagne picnic, and you can even take a boat tour   if you like. Tours Of The South Rim If you prefer to start your tour in Arizona, then you'll tour the South Rim instead, but you can also go to the South Rim from Vegas. This is just a one hour flight from Las Vegas, or you can drive to Tusayan from anywhere in Arizona. You get to choose from the least expensive half hour air tour of the South Rim, or the longer tour that lasts nearly an hour, which is highly recommended. The longer tour takes you from the South Rim to the remote wilderness of the North Rim and on over to the eastern edge of the Grand Canyon National Park. It is the most comprehensive air tour available and lets you see a great deal of beautiful scenery and landmarks. Your chopper won't be allowed to land at the South Rim, but you can add on a 4x4 tour of the park instead. One way to do this is to book a package that comes with a 30-minute flight over the canyon with a ground tour that gives you 2 1/2 hours to tour the park by land. Seeing the canyon by air and land is the perfect combination for appreciating the beauty and immensity of the canyon. Deluxe Helicopters Booking a deluxe tour ensures you'll have the best viewing experience possible on a helicopter tour. The deluxe helicopters are made with large panoramic windows so you have outstanding views without obstruction, plus the seats are designed for comfort and personal space. They're also quiet inside and are some of the smoothest helicopters in the air. So if you are able to book a deluxe tour, don't pass up the chance to fly on one of these aircraft. Grand Canyon Helicopter Tours On Labor Day Labor Day Weekend is September 5th-7th, and it is the last big vacation weekend for the year. This makes it one of the busiest times of the year for Grand Canyon helicopter tours. If you want to take a tour on Labor Day, then book as early as you can. Booking now would be best, but at the very least, make sure you book before the week beginning August 24. Buying your tour early is the sure way to get seats for your tour. Book online to confirm you seats and make a significant saving in booking fees, too. Make This The Best Labor Day Yet To get great views of the National Park, try a helicopter tour. And don't forget you can add on fun landing adventures at the canyon that add to the excitement and enjoyment of your tour. Don't forget to buy your tour early and do it online. The Grand Canyon is one of the most amazing places on the planet. You'll appreciate its grandeur much more if you see it from a helicopter tour you book out of Tusayan or Las Vegas. \n  recommends these South Rim helicopter tours.
