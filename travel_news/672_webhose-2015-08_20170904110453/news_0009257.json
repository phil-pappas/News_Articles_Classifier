Next, they enjoyed a trip to The Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo at The Dubai Mall followed by lunch at the popular Indian restaurant Junoon at Shangri-La Hotel.\nDuring their time in Dubai, the Indian journalists also dropped by at Paris Gallery – a Strategic Partner of DFRE – where they had the opportunity to snap up exciting deals from DSS shopping promotions on a number of designer brands. They also visited crowd-favourite shopping destination City Centre Deira where they met with the mall’s Senior Manager – Majed Al Fahim.\nA visit to the DFRE offices was also on the agenda – providing Indian journalists an insight into the backend operations that facilitate the smooth running of Dubai’s annual calendar of festivals.\nThe visiting journalists also toured the old Dubai area including key spots such as the Gold Souk. An exciting glimpse into the Emirati heritage and traditions at The Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU) offered journalists a taste of the country’s culture and customs.\nThe media group was also hosted by Dubai’s ever smiling mascot Modhesh at his residence Modhesh World – one of the largest indoor edutainment destinations in the region – where they were treated to numerous attractions, activities and stage shows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T16:12:16.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
