Created on Tuesday, 18 August 2015 10:30 BMA House has teamed up with preferred suppliers, Event Prop Hire, Leverick Flowers and Freelove Entertainment to help recreate the world of Narnia themed Christmas package for this winter. Rebecca Hurley, Events Marketing Manager for BMA House, says: “With our suppliers we are offering the option for party bookers to add unique touches from this favourite novel for their guests this Christmas. Event Prop Hire can bring in a variety of props, including wise old Aslan who we hope you will choose to make an appearance at your party! Props help our guests move away from the ordinary and get into the party mood as they escape into the world of Narnia.” \nThe highly accessible central London venue will offer guests the chance to ‘Step through the wardrobe’, for an enchanting Narnia experience. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe props available for hire include everything from classic frosty lamp posts, to ice white thrones and snow covered trees, as well as the wise Lion Aslan of course. Laura Henwood from Event Prop Hire says: “Theming is still so important to the overall look and feel of an event. By theming a space guests are able to become immersed into any theme and concept. We are excited to work with BMA House this Christmas to create packages allowing guests to experience a truly magical and enjoyable evening.” Standing Christmas receptions start from £55* per person including venue hire, mulled wine or prosecco and seasonal canapés from the creative in house catering team. Upgrade to seated dinner packages which include a three course festive dinner, wine, mince pies and crackers. Event bookers can upgrade to an icy white dance floor supplied by Freelove Entertainment and a DJ is also included.
