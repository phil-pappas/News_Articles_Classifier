Medical tourism is said to be a $50 billion-a-year business, and one that is increasing by 15-25 percent year over year, according to Patients Beyond Borders, an industry publication. \nWhile countries like Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia have traditionally dominated the market, a number of Middle Eastern nations are fast becoming go-to destinations for affluent people looking to find affordable, quality healthcare and catch some sun while they’re at it. \nDubai is surging upwards in the medical travel market with a plan to bring half a million medical tourists a year to the city’s hospitals by 2020. It’s quickly making its way towards that goal: last year, the city saw 135,000 foreign visitors use its hospitals, and this year expects an 11 percent increase to 150,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:25.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
