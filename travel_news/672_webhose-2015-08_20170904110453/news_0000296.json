Recent reports have stated approximately four million tourists visited Egypt during the first half of 2015, an 11% increase compared to 2014 figures during the same period. The new 6.2-mile stretch of waterway is a construction feat and will have a wider positive impact on both the local Egyptian and global economies in terms of minimizing shipping time and costs, plus benefit the environment with ships using less fuel and reducing pollution. The enlarged canal should allow ships to sail in both directions at the same time, halving navigation time through the canal to approximately 11 hours. As the Egypt Specialist, Insight Vacations returned to this iconic destination in January 2015 with Global CEO John Boulding joining guests on the first escorted journey back to the land of the Nile. With the re-launch of the renowned Suez Canal, visitors from around the world are encouraged to explore the land of the Pharaohs and enjoy the warm hospitality that Egyptians are revered for. Offering eight handcrafted trips to Egypt, including a \"Luxury Gold\" collection of opulent journeys, all Insight Vacations itineraries include five-star hotels, airport transfers, coach transport with business-class legroom, sightseeing, many meals and the services of an experienced tour director. Elegance of Egypt The sites encountered on this eight-day \"Luxury Gold\" journey will enchant lovers of myth and mystery. Many of Egypt's cities and towns were developed along the Nile, so a luxurious cruise aboard the MS Tosca is like a window to the heart and soul of this amazing country. Starting in Cairo, guests will stay at the luxurious Cairo Marriott , conveniently located on Gezira Island in downtown Cairo . The central section was once the Gezirah Palace built for the Khedive Isma'il Pasha in 1869. Travelers then have the opportunity to gaze upon the most recognizable symbols of ancient Egypt: the full-faced funeral mask, gold coffin, gilded throne and precious jewelery - Tutankhamun's treasure. \nFrom there, guests board a plane for a morning flight across the desert to Aswan where they will visit the Aswan High Dam and the granite quarries , where one of Queen Hatshepsut's obelisks lies abandoned in the bedrock . For the ultimate in luxury and refinement, guests will then set sail aboard the luxurious all-suite River Tosca where they will experience old world elegance, blended with modern amenities and comfort . The spacious suites are tastefully designed with marble bathrooms. Outside the sun deck, pool and shaded cabanas offer an oasis of calm to relax and enjoy the ever-changing scenery . Throughout the Egyptian adventure, guests will travel in first-class transportation, enjoying the unique comfort of Insight's luxury air-conditioned 40-seat coach (a sweet reprieve from the desert heat) with extended legroom and on-board restroom. For those that like to over pack, baggage handling is at your service, with seamless and prompt delivery to your door at every one of the first class and deluxe hotels. Splendors of Egypt A 12-day venture from Cairo to Giza, Karnak, West Bank, Philae Island and Aswan , including an eight-day Nile cruise . After exploring the highlights of Cairo, including a visit to the Egyptian museum and a sound and light show at the Great Pyramids , travelers will explore the Complex of Karnak in Luxor before setting sail along the Nile on a traditional felucca. The eight-day Nile cruise includes one of Egypt's best-preserved Temples, the Temple of Hathor in Dendra, a visit to the Valley of the Kings and the Temples of Horus at Edfu . In Aswan, like Winston Churchill and Agatha Christie, guests will enjoy the sunset and high tea in colonial English style at Aswan's famous Old Cataract Hotel. On return to Cairo the group will enjoy the Great Pyramids of Giza experience including a face-to-face meeting with the enigmatic Sphinx . During the visit, guests get to venture inside one these ancient wonders to see the chambers where the Pharaohs were sent to meet their Gods in the afterlife.
