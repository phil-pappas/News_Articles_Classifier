Peter Knego The 265-by-41-foot ice-strengthened Nordstjernen measures 2,191-gt and was built by the Blohm and Voss shipyard at Hamburg, Germany in 1956. Hurtigruten image Shown in a vintage postcard view, Nordstjernen was commissioned for Bergen Line, one of three companies that formed the company now known as Hurtigruten for state-sponsored, weekly line voyages between Bergen and Kirkenes. Peter Knego collection Fullscreen As built, the Nordstjernen had a capacity for 450 passengers with berths for 192 in first and second class. Over the years, the ship has been upgraded with several refits and now carries a maximum of 150 guests in 71 staterooms. Peter Knego In 1983/4, the Nordstjernen was given a brand new MaK diesel engine that can drive the ship’s single screw at a speed of 15 knots. Peter Knego In recent years, the Nordstjernen was fitted with a large crane for loading and unloading cargo and launching its fleet of Polarcirkel expedition craft. Peter Knego Like zodiacs but with a center grab bar and more comfortable seating, the Nordstjernen’s Polarcirkel craft are perfect for the ship’s Svalbard itineraries where they take guests ashore at remote spots and buzz through glacial ice fields. Peter Knego In 2012, Hurtigruten sold the Nordstjernen to current owners Vestland Classic, who took the ship to Gdansk, Poland for a multi-million dollar refit. Nordstjernen is now under protected status from the Norwegian Directorate of Cultural Heritage. Peter Knego The Nordstjernen has four passenger decks, starting at the top with Bridge Deck. The wheelhouse, which has a combination of vintage and modern equipment, is often open for visits, conditions permitting. Peter Knego This is a view over Nordstjernen’s long foredeck through the Bridge windows. Peter Knego Nordstjernen’s bridge wings are especially popular vantages when the ship is sailing through scenic areas. Peter Knego Bridge Deck has beautifully restored teak decking. Peter Knego The Nordstjernen’s new owners have restored the ship’s original black and white Bergen Line funnel livery. Peter Knego This is a view of the aft portion of Bridge Deck, which has alcoves of bench seating atop lifebelt trunks. Peter Knego From aft Bridge Deck there is direct access to the fantail on Salon Deck. Peter Knego Unlike most cruise ships, Nordstjernen has an open foredeck or fo’c’sle, which is a popular spot for viewing birds and other wildlife. Peter Knego The Polarcirkel craft are stowed on either side of the cargo holds on the Salon Deck fo’c’sle area. Peter Knego Small sheltered terraces on either side of Salon Deck are used for embarkation and disembarkation in most ports. Peter Knego The aft portion of Salon Deck is the most popular outdoor guest area on board the Nordstjernen. Peter Knego Teak deck chairs line the Salon Deck fantail. Peter Knego On its Spitsbergen cruises, when the Nordstjernen crosses the northernmost 80 degree mark, a champagne toast and ceremony is held on the fantail. Peter Knego A teak John Hastie and Company emergency steering wheel is located on aft Salon Deck. Not surprisingly, it is a favorite guest “selfie” spot. Peter Knego A narrow sheltered promenade stretches aft along either side of the next level, C Deck. Peter Knego On midships C Deck, there is a sheltered landing for loading and storage of guests’ luggage. Peter Knego At the aft end of C Deck, there is a mooring station and more sheltered deck space. Peter Knego The former first class Lounge, now known as the Forward Lounge, begins a dedicated level of public rooms on Salon Deck. Peter Knego The Forward Lounge has picture windows on either side and forward. This comfortable space has retained its classic Scandinavian decor. Peter Knego Original, colorful wood carvings commissioned for the ship in 1956 still grace the bulkheads of the Forward Lounge. Peter Knego In the aft/port corner of the Forward Lounge, there is a painting of the Nordstjernen. Peter Knego Even the room’s still-functioning vintage Scandinavian light fixtures have been left intact. Peter Knego Directly aft of the Forward Lounge is the handsomely original Hall, where most guests will first enter the ship. In its aft portion, a staircase leads up to Bridge Deck. Peter Knego 32. Framing the stairs that lead down to Deck C, the forward bulkhead of the Hall features a beautiful vintage wood carving of a mythical sea horse. Peter Knego The Restaurant is directly aft of the Hall and features port and starboard galleries of seating with picture windows overlooking the sea. Peter Knego The forward portion of the Restaurant has a bulkhead with original carved wooden artwork inlaid with ceramics of Norwegian flora and fauna that now serves as a backdrop for the ship’s breakfast and lunch buffets. Peter Knego This is a view of some of the vintage detailing on the Restaurant’s forward bulkhead. Peter Knego More ceramic art is displayed on the inner bulkhead of the Restaurant’s port and starboard galleries. Peter Knego Table settings on the Nordstjernen are charming but basic, with folded paper napkins, a knife, fork and water glass. Peter Knego Breakfast and lunch (shown) are served buffet style with a salad, soup, cold cuts and other appetizers as well as fresh fish and a hot entree. Dinner is full service but with a set three course menu. Peter Knego Additional dining seating is available in the Cafe, directly aft of the Restaurant on the ship’s port side. Peter Knego In the forward portion of the Cafe, some original Bergen Line memorabilia and service ware is displayed in a cabinet. Peter Knego Complimentary coffee and tea are available in the Cafe on a round-the-clock basis. Peter Knego Buffet style breakfast and lunchtime sweets are also available in the Cafe. Peter Knego A small Library stocked with books about the history and geology of the places Nordstjernen visits is located at the aft end of the Cafe. Peter Knego An intimate bar with windows overlooking the sea is located on the starboard side of the Cafe. Peter Knego A favorite pre and post dinner gathering spot, the Bar has beer on tap, wine and a selection of liquor for purchase. Peter Knego The largely restyled former 2nd Class Lounge, now called the Aft Lounge, follows the Cafe with galleries of seating on either side of the ship. A small souvenir shop is also located here. Peter Knego A second stairtower heads down to the accommodation on Decks C, B and A from the aft portion of the Aft Lounge. Peter Knego On Deck C, the mahogany paneled Reception office is at the base of the forward stairs. Peter Knego This is a forward facing view from the Reception area on Deck C. Peter Knego Although the Nordstjernen is no longer owned by Hurtigruten, it still has the original mailbox with slots for each of the ports the ship visited during its time on the Norwegian coastal run. Peter Knego Fullscreen Port and starboard passageways line the accommodation on Deck B. As Nordstjernen was a modest ship built for the Norwegian coastal run, its staterooms, many of which do not have private facilities, are smaller overall than those on modern cruise ships. Peter Knego The largest staterooms on the Nordstjernen are the former first class Category N cabins, most of which were located on Deck C. Directly forward on the starboard side of Reception, 304 has two lower beds and two picture windows. Peter Knego Stateroom 304 has its own in suite bathroom with shower, toilet and sink. Peter Knego Category N stateroom 301 features upper and lower berths and a sofa. Peter Knego At the aft end of Deck C, Category N stateroom 351 has upper and lower berthing and two large windows that look out onto the promenade. Peter Knego Slightly smaller Category J triple stateroom 353, which also has two windows and private facilities is also on aft Deck C. Peter Knego Category A staterooms have upper/lower berths, a small closet, private facilities and a porthole. This is stateroom 211 on port Deck B. Peter Knego Category A bathrooms are compact with showers that can be enclosed with curtains but drain directly onto the floor. Peter Knego The brass portholes can be covered with a metal deadlight at night (handy in the Norwegian summertime). Some of them even open to let in the fresh sea air. Peter Knego This is one of the slightly larger Category A staterooms, number 225 on port Deck B. Peter Knego Category D staterooms have an upper and lower configuration, a porthole and an in suite sink but no restroom or shower, both of which are located in the passage, steps away. Peter Knego Located on aft Deck B, stateroom 282 is a quadruple Category D without private facilities. Peter Knego Stateroom 282, a Category D double has an angled bulkhead that conforms to the ship’s shapely stern. Peter Knego Cozy Category I staterooms are interiors with private facilities. Located on forward Deck B, 239 has an upper/lower configuration. Peter Knego Category I stateroom 302 on Deck C is shown with the upper berth folded. Peter Knego Located at the bottom of the ship on Deck A, Category E stateroom 114 has two fixed upper and lower berths and a sink only. Peter Knego The Nordstjernen is among the last of a dwindling number of classic passenger ships. While it lacks many of the modern cruising bells and whistles, it offers adventure-seeking guests a rare chance to experience cruising as it used to be. Peter Knego Like this topic?

Our latest Cruise Ship Tour, in the carousel above, offers a deck-by-deck look at the 150-passenger Nordstjernen , a beautifully restored passenger vessel from the 1950s that is operating expedition cruises to the polar bear-filled Norwegian Arctic. \nOne of a dwindling number of classic passenger ships still in operation, the ice-strengthened Nordstjernen lacks many of the bells and whistles found on modern cruise ships. But as can be seen in the photo tour, it offers adventure-seeking travelers a rare chance to experience cruising as it used to be. \nThe Nordstjernen currently is under charter to Hurtigruten, a Norway-based company known for expedition cruises to the polar regions. \nDesigned as a research tool for vacationers considering a voyage, the Nordstjernen photo tour -- by veteran cruise writer and ship photographer Peter Knego -- is the 134th in our ongoing series of ship galleries.

Laura Bly The Midnatsol, seen here entering the port of Kjøllefjord, was launched in 2003 and is the newest of Hurigruten's three Millennium-class ships. It is one of 11 Hurtigruten vessels that sail the Western coast of Norway year-round. Laura Bly Fullscreen Hurtigruten, Norwegian for \"fast route\" and formerly known as Norwegian Coastal Voyage, has been operating ships along the country's fjord region every day since 1893. Thanks to the moderating influence of the Gulf Stream, Norway's coastal waters even far north of the Arctic Circle remain free of ice year-round. Laura Bly Fullscreen The Midnatsol calls at 34 ports on the 12-day round-trip between Bergen and Kirkenes - including Vardø, shown here. Sailings and ports of call experienced at night on the northbound voyage are seen during the day on the return and vice versa. Laura Bly The historic, hill-ringed city of Bergen, which receives about 90 inches of rain a year, serves as the southern terminus for the Midnatsol's coastal route. Laura Bly Fullscreen One of the Midnatsol's most unusual - and most delicious - shore excursions is a \"king crab safari\" offered from Kirkenes. Participants take a boat to watch crabs being hauled from pots anchored deep in the fjord, then enjoy an all-you-can-eat feast at a rustic fishing cabin. Laura Bly Fullscreen The new, starkly moving Steilneset Memorial in Vardø, designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois, is dedicated to the victims of witchcraft trials held here during the 17th century. The memorial is an easy walk from the Midnatsol's dock. Laura Bly Fullscreen During Hurtigruten's early days, its ships carried mail and other cargo to areas difficult to access by land. Today, they still serve as a convenient way for locals to travel from point to point - including this young boy, whose aunt was seeing him (and his antlers) off on a trip to visit his father four hours away. Laura Bly Watching cargo being loaded and unloaded at each port - from electronics to vintage wooden skiffs - is a popular activity among Hurtigruten passengers. And calls are often brief - as short as 15 minutes. Laura Bly Passengers gather on the top deck of the Midnatsol for ringside views of the Trollfjord, a narrow, steep-sided inlet to which Hurtigruten ships often make a scenic detour, weather permitting. Laura Bly Since Hurigruten ships make so many stops, cabin vistas often include scenes like this one in Kristiansund's busy harbor. Laura Bly A view of the nearby coastline is reflected in an outside cabin porthole on the Midnatsol's promenade Deck 6, which wraps completely around the ship. Laura Bly Despite Norway's often nippy weather, the Midnatsol's two sun deck hot tubs are popular gathering spots - including at night during the winter, when the Northern Lights are often visible. Laura Bly A view of the ship's second hot tub and outdoor shower, located on Deck 9. Laura Bly Norway's Viking heritage and prodigious bird life is reflected in this traditional wall sculpture on the top sun deck. Laura Bly A giant chess set greets passengers on the Midnatsol's sun deck. Laura Bly Afternoon delight: A Midnatsol staffer offers traditional Norwegian waffles with fruit preserves and cream. Laura Bly Dress on board the Midnatsol is strictly casual - though wool sweaters and Norway-made Helly Hensen jackets outnumber sleeping bags as cold-weather attire. Laura Bly Crossing the Arctic Circle is always cause for celebration, with ceremonies that differ depending on which direction the ship is headed. The southbound version, shown here, includes a spoonful of cod liver oil followed by a chaser of cloudberry liqueur. Laura Bly This sun deck bar, open during the warmer months, is one of two bars on the Midnatsol. Laura Bly A view of the Midnatsol's front reception area, which includes prominent portraits of Norway's King Harald and Queen Sonja. Laura Bly Trolls are ubiquitous in Norway - and this one, on Deck 5 near the ship's 24-hour, self-service Midtsommer Cafe, serves as a popular photo op. Laura Bly An artistic depiction of Norway's Northern Lights greets passengers in Midnatsol's contemporary, five-deck atrium. Laura Bly A model of the MS Midnatsol is located in a seating area of the Midtsommer Cafe. Laura Bly Another seating area is located near the ship's 24-hour cafe. Laura Bly Light woods, warm colors and glass dominate the decor on board the Midnatsol, including the Information Center where passengers can explore shore excursion options. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's handsome library, with floor-to-ceiling windows, includes a selection of jigsaw puzzles and board games. Laura Bly A signature feature of Midnatsol and her sister ship, the MS Trollfjord, is a two-level Observation Lounge located on the top decks at the bow. Laura Bly Two \"point to point\" passengers catch a few winks on the lower level of the Midnatsol's Observation Lounge. Laura Bly While the Midnatsol's Mysterier Bar includes a piano and small dance floor, standard cruise ship-type diversions are noticeably absent on Hurtigruten ships. Laura Bly Floor-to-ceiling windows, even in the ship's stairwells, provide ample opportunities to admire the passing scenery. Laura Bly The excursion desk on the Midnatsol, where excursions are offered in Norwegian and English (other languages are offered as necessary). Though many port calls are short, passengers can rejoin the ship at a port further along the route. Laura Bly Artwork in the Midtsummer Cafe seating area on Deck 5 reflects the long maritime history of Hurtigruten, which has been plying the Norwegian coasts since 1893. Laura Bly The cozy Hamsun Room on Deck 8 is named is named for Norwegian Knut Hamsun, Nobel prize winner for literature in 1920. Laura Bly Chef Anders Gøransson demonstrates how to peel -and eat - a just-caught shrimp. It was part of a catch delivered to the Midnatsol by a local fisherman earlier that evening as the ship sailed to Tromsø. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's 24-hour, self-service cafe offers a la carte items (a shrimp salad plate costs about $12) and is available to both full-cruise passengers and those using the ship for point-to-point transportation. Laura Bly The entrance to the Midnatsol's dining room, which serves full-cruise passengers with open-seating, buffet-style breakfast and lunch and two assigned seatings for dinner. Laura Bly The Midnatsol dining room offers tables for two, four, six and eight. Set, three-course dinner menus (soup or salad, main dish and dessert) emphasize fresh local fish such as cod and salmon. Laura Bly A view of the Midnatsol's buffet. Laura Bly Alcoholic beverages are taxed heavily in Norway, so wine, beer and hard liquor prices are steep: $11 for a glass of beer, or nearly $13.50 for a glass of house wine. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's lunch buffet includes many Norwegian and Scandinavian foods - including three kinds of herring (mustard, sherry, and sour cream). Laura Bly The Midnatsol charges full-cruise passengers for coffee and tea outside meal times, but also sells mugs that are good for unlimited refills. Laura Bly Bartender Vanessa Caqueiro shows off a few selections of aquavit, one of Scandinavia's traditional liqueurs. Laura Bly The Paradis Bar, located on the starboard side of Deck 8, is near the ship's central atrium. Laura Bly The Mysterier Bar, also on Deck 8, is decorated in shades of blue and green. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's gift shop stocks everything from postcards (which can be stamped to commemorate an Arctic Circle crossing) to foul weather jackets and cod liver pâté. Laura Bly Though Midnatsol passengers (about 10% Americans) tend to be middle-aged and older, the ship does have a small children's play area near the Midtsummer Cafe. Laura Bly Seating areas on either side of the Midnatsol's conference facilities on Deck 5 serve as quiet spots to relax. Laura Bly The carpets in passenger cabins reflect the Midnatosol's surroundings and heritage - including Viking ships. Laura Bly The ship features 11 categories of cabin accommodations, including outside doubles that range from 75- to 140-square-feet. Laura Bly Standard Mindnatsol cabins, like this one, feature twin beds. Laura Bly Bathrooms in both outside and inside cabins are almost identical, and feature showers with adjustable heads and liquid soap/shampoo. Laura Bly Cabin bathrooms include ample shelves and wall-mounted hair dryers. Laura Bly Desk areas in both outside and inside cabins feature shallow shelves for additional storage. Laura Bly Teak-toned shelves and closet in an outside cabin are roomy enough to hold bulky sweaters and storm jackets. Laura Bly Though it may not be obvious to non-Norwegians, this button turns on a bathroom floor warmer - just the ticket on cooler days. Laura Bly American passengers need to bring a two-pin adapter plug for the Midnatsol cabins, which run on 220 volts A.V. Laura Bly View of a cozy inside cabin, which measures from 65- to 108-square-feet. This carpet design depicts a puffin bird. Laura Bly Only suites and inside cabins come with televisions, but the telephones in all cabins double as a radio and public address system for ship announcements, including upcoming port calls. Laura Bly Cabin beds can also be converted into couches, and include crisp white duvets. Laura Bly A view of a hallway leading to some of the Midnatsol's 24 suites. Laura Bly Only five of the Midnatsol's 24 suites have a private balcony, including this Grand Suite. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's Grand Suites, which include a sitting area and separate bedroom, range from 377- to 398-square-feet. Laura Bly The desk area of a Grand Suite. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's Grand Suites feature large walk-in showers, marble sinks and upgraded soaps and shampoo. Laura Bly The entertainment area of a Grand Suite, which includes a television and minibar. Laura Bly Regular suites on the Midnatsol range from 301- to 323-square-feet. Laura Bly The entry area of a Midnatsol suite features gleaming wood and, in some categories, a separate walk-in closet. Laura Bly Many Midnatsol suites include a separate shower and large bathtub. Laura Bly The Midnatsol's suites come with in-cabin coffee makers, but standard cabins do not. Room service is available only to suite passengers for an extra charge. Laura Bly In lieu of a balcony, the 10 Grand Suites on Deck 8 offer a large bay window. Laura Bly Mini-suites like this one, located on Deck 6, measure from 194- to 215-square-feet. Laura Bly One of four handicap-accessible cabins on the Midnatsol. Laura Bly The bathroom of a handicap-accessible cabin, which are located near an elevator on Deck 6. Laura Bly Free (albeit sporadic) WiFi is available in Midnatsol's cabins and public areas, and the ship also offers Internet-enabled computers midship on Deck 8. Laura Bly Bicycles are available to rent during the Midnatsol's frequent port calls. Laura Bly The ship's sauna, located next to the gym on Deck 9, features expansive views. Laura Bly A small fitness room on the Midnatsol features treadmills and weights. Laura Bly While the Midnatsol doesn't offer pressing or dry cleaning - and its casual, expedition-style ambiance doesn't call for dresses or jackets - it does provide a self- service laundry room. Laura Bly The most comprehensive Norway cruises — 34 ports of call including several above the Arctic Circle — are operated by Hurtigruten. Hurtigruten Like this topic?
