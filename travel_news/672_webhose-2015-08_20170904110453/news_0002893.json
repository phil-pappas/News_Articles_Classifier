PETERSBURG, Fla. , Aug. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vacation rental sites like Airbnb and VRBO have become trendy alternatives to hotels. With their growing popularity comes questions about how this new type of expense can be insured. Squaremouth , America's fastest growing travel insurance comparison site, explains how travel insurance coverage applies to accommodation rentals. Insuring Unconventional Expenses Vacation rentals often have a strict cancellation policy, sometimes offering little to no reimbursement, regardless of the reason for cancellation. Fortunately for travelers, the cost of rentals, like those booked through Airbnb and VRBO, can be covered under a travel insurance policy, including any associated deposits, expenses and cancellation fees. Covered Reasons for Cancelling The standard Trip Cancellation reasons still apply to travelers insuring a rental property. Common covered reasons include illness of a traveler, their family member, or weather preventing the trip. In the event of a claim, the traveler will need to show proof of their rental and their out-of-pocket expenses. \"In most cases, your email confirmation from your rental will suffice if it includes what you paid, your lodging dates, and any penalties you would incur if you cancelled,\" said Brandi Morse , Squaremouth's Zero Complaint Manager. Morse also explains that the traveler must formally cancel their stay: \"The first step of the claim would be to cancel with the owner of the rental property\". The Common Concerns Never Covered Despite the benefits of choosing a rental property over other accommodations, travelers may feel they are sacrificing the reliability that comes with an established hotel. \"A common concern of travelers who choose a rental property, is that the accommodations will be insufficient, different than were advertised, or the rental is a scam altogether,\" says Squaremouth Director of Marketing, Megan Singh . Unfortunately, these concerns are never covered reasons to cancel or interrupt a trip under a standard travel insurance policy. Even the \"catch all\" 'Cancel for Any Reason' policies can't offer help in these situations, as they require a trip to be cancelled days before reaching the destination. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:00:18.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
