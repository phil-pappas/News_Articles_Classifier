All these take place on April 10 next year with the opening ceremony held in the Kim II Sung Stadium and a finish at the city’s Arch of Triumph. \nEntry is only available through a tour group and Intrepid’s package includes a week’s tour of the country afterwards. The package price, departing on April 8, is from £1,695 and includes flights to Beijing. \nThe transfer from the Chinese capital, also included, is by air, with the return journey to China by overnight train. Highlights include a visit to the demilitarized zone and Mount Myohyang; plus the city of Pyongsong and the surrounding countryside. \nTwo local guides and a driver will accompany the group at all times as tourists are not allowed to travel around independently. \nMichael Edwards, Intrepid Travel UK managing director, said: “It’s not possible to enter the Pyongyang Marathon without being part of a tour group, so it’s exciting to be able to offer such a rare opportunity to both amateur runners and those who travel around the world clocking up marathons in different countries. \n“The marathon takes place early on in the trip, leaving a week to travel around the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and explore this fascinating country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:08:26.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
