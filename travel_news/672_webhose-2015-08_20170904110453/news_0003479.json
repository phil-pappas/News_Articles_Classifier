Embark on a Great British Drive » Which Dorset do tourists want in 2015? The Dorset of ice creams, postcards, buckets and spades? Or fossils, windswept moors and World Heritage coast? Or the Dorset of Brad Pitt the tank commander, runner ducks, racing sheep, a wine called Tyrannosaurus Red and a chance to milk Molly the Magic Cow? Probably a mixture of all, which is what this gently meandering, 86-mile tour delivers, never straying too far from the craggy Jurassic coastline. You can spot your first stop – Purbeck House, in the seaside town of Swanage – a mile off. It not only occupies the highest point on the High Street, but is also a conspicuous example of “Scottish Baronial” architecture. Its creator, Victorian construction magnate George Burt, was a man who wanted to impress. He embellished his home with architectural treasures spirited from London, including statues from the Royal Exchange, a tiled floor from the Houses of Parliament, an imposing arch that once stood in Hyde Park and columns from old Billingsgate market, earning him the sobriquet the “King of Swanage” from Thomas Hardy in the process. Pick a bedroom at the top of his “castle” and you’ll be rewarded not with views of gritty suburbia, but of sparkling Poole Bay. After a short morning stroll to the seafront, head slightly inland on the A351 to a real stronghold, or at least the remains of one. Park and hike to the windy top of romantic, ruined Corfe Castle, now a National Trust monument. It’s well worth the climb: the views back across the pretty village are as good as those of the ramparts themselves. Despite its Georgian grandeur, Moonfleet Manor hotel is family-friendly and as shabbily, chicly comfortable as your own home Now follow the leafy A351 to Wareham, park by the Saxon Walls and – grabbing the picnic you bought at the award-winning Purbeck Deli in Swanage – enjoy it as you lean back against the mighty, grassed, earthen “walls” built to repel Vikings, on the orders of King Alfred. Today the only invaders are the tourists who flock to the picturesque Quay. Join them by strolling along Pound Lane and sitting on the grass by the bridge to enjoy an ice cream, before negotiating the A352 to the unmissable Tank Museum. The romantic and ruined Corfe Castle Anyone with even a passing interest in military history – or vehicles – will love the grandly imposing collection of 300 tanks. This vast, modern facility houses rare gems such as Little Willie (the first completed tank prototype in history) and Tiger 131 (the only operating Tiger tank in the world). The Fury exhibition celebrates the museum’s close involvement with the 2014 Brad Pitt film of the same name. The very Sherman used in the film makes a startling centrepiece, complete with waxwork of Pitt himself, swaggering by the gun barrel. Leaving thoughts of conflict behind, head for pretty, crescent-shaped Lulworth Cove, its neighbouring feature Stair Hole and the dramatic limestone arch of nearby Durdle Door (accessible via the Durdle Door Holiday Park) before rejoining the swooping A352, then dropping down through Osmington on the A353 to view the striking 323ft White Horse, carved into the hillside in 1808 and depicting King George III. Now repose like royalty yourself at Moonfleet Manor hotel, tucked away inside Chesil Bank. Despite its Georgian grandeur, it is family-friendly and as shabbily, chicly comfortable as your own home. Parents can entrust their prodigies to the crèche before shirking off to the spa or for long beach walks, to admire the boats bobbing on the Fleet lagoon. Next morning, stick with the coastal theme by following the B3157 to the Abbotsbury Swannery, where the brackish water and the birds’ favourite snack – eelgrass – have attracted flocks to the shoreline for millennia. The Furleigh estate produces some of England’s finest wines, including its sparkling classic cuvée “It’s a five-star hotel for swans,” says general manager John Houston. “They’re not penned in; they really want to stay.” Visitors like to linger, too. After watching the swan-feeding, then admiring the Children’s Farm in the ancient Great Barn where children can milk Molly the Magic Cow, it’s time for a flutter on the sheep, which – enticed by tasty morsels – race along a 200m course, entertaining all ages. The bronze Buddha in Abbotsbury’s Subtropical Gardens It’s been so successful, they’re training a top-flight team of Indian runner ducks for their own race. Other attractions include alpacas, goats, mini-donkeys, chinchillas, gerbils and hamsters. There are more animals – real and sculpted – at Abbotsbury’s 20-acre Subtropical Gardens, a cool paradise in summer. It’s not just the Burmese rope bridge, luscious palms and tree ferns that transport visitors to the tropics; so, too, do the cries of the caged Australian kookaburras, a praying bronze Buddha and running beasts carved from a fallen oak. Now it’s time to enjoy cultivation of a different kind, at the Furleigh wine estate at Salway Ash, a half-hour drive along the A35 then the pretty B3162 – perfect for the Volkswagen Touareg I am driving, with its refined, long-legged comfort, pace and 4WD performance. Its elevated seating position makes it ideal for peeping over the hedges and across fields. The family-run Furleigh estate produces some of England’s finest wines, including its sparkling classic cuvée, its silver medal-winning sparkling rosé and its light “Sea Pink” still rosé. My award for best name goes to their Tyrannosaurus Red. The vineyard tour is fun, but there’s probably nowhere finer to enjoy Furleigh’s finest than at the evocatively named Summer Lodge, in the idyllic village of Evershot, with its beautiful church of St Osmund’s. Set in gracious grounds with rolling lawns, pagodas, lovingly tended borders, “secret” sitting areas, ponds, mini-waterfalls and discreet sunloungers, it’s the perfect get-away-from-it-all retreat. Indulge in its whisky room and collection of fine Armagnacs, or relax in the spa, enjoying attentive service and a feeling of tranquillity. This is the Dorset every tourist wants.
