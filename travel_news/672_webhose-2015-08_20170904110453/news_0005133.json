The tower could one day prove to be an alternative launch pad into space.\nThis ambitious project could deliver a better reach for scientific research, communication and tourism. A Canadian press says that this could be an airport on the edge of the space.\nThoth co-founder and chief technical officer Brendan Quine told CP from the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Pembroke felt that the structure from its highest floor would be able to launch single stage space plane directly into the low earth orbit.\nThe engineering challenges to build the structure and to maintain its integrity by making sure that it does not snap off from the middle will be a huge challenge felt Ishwar Puri, dean of engineering at McMaster University.\nThere are three great challenges, of material, stability and energy that will need to be balanced in order to see the structure achieve its objective. The tether technology will be used to help the elevator ascend and descend. A mechanical climber goes up the string to attach a second string and solidify the first one. This process gets repeated until the ‘string’ has been thickened to a cable, or a space elevator. The problem is finding the material that is both tensile and lightweight enough to build the cable. No material as yet been found that has sufficiently high tensile and low density out of which the cable could be constructed.\nThe cable would have to hold its own weight as well as the weight of the elevator and the climbers. The string will need to be absolutely taught and have tension. So far carbon nanotubes have been considered as the most tensile and their strength is at the nanoscale. But there are still some speculations on the strength of the nanotubes.\nThe free standing structure will have an electric elevator that reaches kilometers above the earth and will be made of inflatable material. The company is planning to use materials like polyethylene and Kevlar and leverage the power of gas pressure to create a strong, rigid structure capable of holding up the immense mass.\nTo null the external forces the tower hopes to use pneumatic pressure and actually lean the tower, actively guide the centre of gravity towards things like hurricanes, lightning on Earth, and meteors, space debris, radiation, and electromagnetic fields in space, so that the tower won’t fall down.\nThere are many challenges to supply energy to the inflatable tower. When the elevator goes up and down it will be utilizing electricity at a long distance. What happens when there is a blackout feels experts? A hospital environment will have to be created which would be an oxygen contained atmosphere. The company says that these elevator cars may be self-powered, or get their power supplied “pneumatically, electrically, magnetically or inductively from the elevator core.\nThe project is said to cost between $5 billion and $10 billion (U.S.), and could take three to five years to complete the demonstration tower, and another three years to finish the full version. About a dozen people have been working on the concept since February 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:23:05.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
