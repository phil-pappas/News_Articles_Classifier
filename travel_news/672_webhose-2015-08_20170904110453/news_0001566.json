The birds are swooping on \"intruders\" at the bank on the Ransomes Europark in Ipswich, Suffolk, to protect a baby gull. Branch manager Lorna McQueen said two customers told staff they were \"hit on the back of the head\" by the protective seagulls, saying they were more \"stunned\" than injured. Branch manager Lorna McQueen Photo: Archant She reported it to the RSPCA and was told that hiding under an umbrella would be one of the best deterrents and safety measures. \"I therefore took it upon myself to offer customers the option of being escorted in and out of the branch under a large black umbrella I retrieved from my car,\" she said. \"The RSPCA told me not to move the chick as once it has your scent on it, the parents could stop looking after it. The seagulls have nested on the roof before but something like this has never happened before. The RSPCA said they might not come out as it is not a priority, but I hope they do.\" 'Swooping is often just a protective mums way of keeping their babies safe...' - RSPCA spokesman An RSPCA spokesman said: \"We assess each call we receive on a case by case basis as many of these gulls, and other young animals, do not need rescuing as they should be looked after by their natural parents. \"Many fledglings discovered by members of the public are mistakenly thought to be injured or abandoned, and subsequently moved from their natural habitat. But their chances of survival are much better in the wild than in captivity. \"If the bird is injured, however, it may be a different story so it is important that is made clear on a call. \"Swooping is often just a protective mums way of keeping their babies safe. The best thing to do is keep a distance and monitor.\" Hungry birds have been known to attack holidaymakers for their food Photo: Ross Parry It follows a warning from a campaigner, who believes seagulls will start killing babies if they are not controlled. Simon Prentis, of the Gull Awareness Group, has launched a petition urging the Government to fund research into the problem of the seaside birds , which have recently killed several pets including a dog and a tortoise. In his petition, Mr Prentis backs Prime Minister David Cameron's call for a \"big conversation\" about urban gulls . Mr Cameron's plea followed a series of incidents, including a pet dog pecked to death by a seagull and a pensioner left battered and bloodied by a dive-bombing seagull . A seagull was also posioned and dumped in a police station yard in Bridgport, Dorset, in an apparent backlash against the birds. The RSPCA warned holidaymakers not to feed seagulls Photo: Press Association Last week, the RSPCA warned people not to feed seagulls or their will attack as it called on councils to introduce new bylaws to look at the problem . And, in a ridiculous twist to the week's seagull news, a Bristol man was criticised by police for calling 999 to report that a seagull had tried to steal his sandwich. In a recording released by Avon and Somerset Police, he is heard to explain the incident to a patient call-handler before urging officers to review CCTV footage. The man, begins to protest, but then terminates the \"emergency\" call. Describing the \"emergency\", the man tells the operator: \"Hello. Right, I'm outside McDonald's in the centre of Bristol, right. \"I just walked out of Sainsbury's towards McDonald's right, and one of them seagulls basically tried to rip the sandwich out of my hand. If you look on the camera...\" The female call-handler politely interrupts the man and says: \"OK, hold on a second. What's this got to do with the police? It's a seagull.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T14:01:19.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
