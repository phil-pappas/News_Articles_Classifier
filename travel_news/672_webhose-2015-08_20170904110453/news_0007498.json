Funded and managed by Delaware North in collaboration with the National Park Service, the project enhances guest room functionality while restoring historic integrity.\nRichard Kollath and Edward McCann of Kollath-McCann Creative Services, hotel designers since 1998, referenced archival images and other historic documents to guide their selection of textiles, colors and accessory items to update the historic cottages, which were built in 1928. The furnishings and materials selected reflect those used in the hotel between 1925 and 1942, which was established by National Park Service historians as the hotel's \"period of historic significance.\" The designers' research steered them toward simple wooden furniture and hand-crafted textiles that echo a western Arts & Crafts style. Highlights of the cottage guest rooms include custom-made Mission Style credenzas and night stands with integrated power outlets and USB ports. The bold, cheerful pattern of the drapery fabric reflects a 1930s design aesthetic, and the texture of the striped broadloom carpet evokes the original hooked rugs that once covered the floors.\n\"We are proud to unveil the refurbished cottages to our guests,\" said General Manager Brett Archer . \"The essence of these cottages has been restored and the modern upgrades enhances the guest experience while allowing visitors to appreciate the landscape of Yosemite .\"\nLinoleum prints of pine cones from local artist Kim Young Min feature exquisite details of indigenous flora found in Yosemite while watercolors of early artist-in-residence Gunnar Widforss capture the incredible grandeur and majesty of Yosemite waterfalls.\nABOUT THE AHWAHNEE\nThe Ahwahnee , a AAA Four-Diamond hotel featuring rustic architecture with Native American, Middle Eastern and Art and Crafts design elements, is located in scenic Yosemite National Park , which is home to stunning natural beauty, year-round activities and historic charm.
