Greece is historically one of the top destinations for Americans; government figures noted approximately 570,000 US travelers visited the breathtaking country in 2014. \"Any negatives in the press regarding tourism travel seem to be completely misconceived,\" said Boulding. \"My family and I had absolutely no issues at all. Everything worked, from ATMs to paying bills by credit card, from transport to shops and restaurants - which were all busy, by the way. The Greeks, as always, were extremely hospitable. The politics are just politics and have no influence on the tourist experience. The main thing for guests to know is that the Greeks want you there and they really do need tourism, right now.\" \nInsight Vacations' Signature Experiences in Greece include ascending Athens' sacred Acropolis to admire the Parthenon and joining a master chef for a cooking class in Olympia to learn the secrets of the local flavors. Of course, no visit to Greece is complete without a cruise of the magnificent Isles. Guests can currently save $300 per couple* on Insight Vacations' eight-day Glories of Greece itinerary to and from Athens departing on October 12, 2015 . Now priced from $1,699 per person twin share, this Greek odyssey includes luxury accommodations, such as a stay at Athens' opulent The Divani Caravel (a member of The Leading Hotels of the World), sightseeing, meals, transfers, transport and the services of an experienced Tour Director.
