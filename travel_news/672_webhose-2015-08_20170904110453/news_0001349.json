Achieving the award for the ‘Best Car/ Campervan Rental Operator’ at the 2015 National Travel Industry Awards (NTIA). \nThe NTIA are voted by AFTA’s membership base and recognise overall excellence in the travel industry. \n“We have a great team that work hard to ensure we provide our customers the best rental experience possible. The last 12 months have been really significant for Hertz, and I’m thrilled that our achievements continue to be recognised,” said Chris Rusden, Vice President of Hertz, Asia Pacific (APAC). \n“Key focus areas at Hertz over the past year include the introduction of new fleet options including Porsche vehicles via the Dream Collection and the newly introduced Family Collection. We also continue to upgrade existent locations and open branches nationally. This award is also a testament to the strong relationships we have within the industry. I would like to thank everyone who voted as well as our partners and staff for their vital ongoing support.” \nThe AFTA is the peak body for Australia’s travel agents and represents the majority of them nationally.
