If you are struck with the golf itch but do not have the time for a long golf excursion or the budget for high end golf destinations, then look no further than Central Illinois. Image this, no expensive flights, no airport security lines, no time changes and best of all no baggage fees. If that is not an attention getter than let me set the hook by say that within a 4 hour drive of Milwaukee you can play a weekends worth of golf on a variety of courses variety at reasonable rates. How is this for reasonable? A round of golf and a nights stay starting at $55 a person, based on double occupancy. (Yes, you read that right!) About Decatur Decatur, Illinois is more known for its blue collar and agricultural roots than a golf destination. However, the area features arguably a collection of three municipal courses that would rival any municipal's trio in the country.Similar in size and stature to Green Bay, the Soybean Capital of the World is home to Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Tate & Lyle. Unlike Green Bay they currently do not have a National Football Team however their welcome sign will point out they are the original birthplace of the Chicago Bears. Weather Typically in the fall and spring, Decatur is 10-15 degrees warmer than Milwaukee with the golf courses opening in early March and closing in late November. Scovill Golf Club brands itself as a year round course. Top Tracks Typically, I list Top courses in order of my favorites. In this cases each of the three courses are so different, that my order has no rhyme or reason other than the order I played them. Red Tail Run Golf Club Designed by the legendary Hall of Fame golfer Raymond Floyd, this signature course is a classic modern links course. \"The Tail\" meanders thru natural prairie on the front nine and thru mature oak forests on the back. Dubbed \"Raymond's Turn\", holes 14 through 17 is Decatur's answer to Amen corner. After playing the course for the first time, Floyd himself remarked that if you can go one over on those four holes you can score well.The meat of the back nine starts at the par five 14th. This hole will have you grabbing your yardage book before every shot including off the tee, where you are faced with a fairway splitting creek that is reachable. Play it safe with a smooth choked down driver or better yet pipe a fairway wood. Less is more for the second shot, hit a mid iron 10-20 yards passed the 150 stake. It is best to leave yourself 120-130 yards out and attack the green with a short iron which takes the pond and narrowing fairway out of play.By far the 15th is the most memorable hole. Three words come to mind; location, location, location. Strategic placement to the left is needed or the tall mature trees will block your approach to the 90 degree dog leg right green.The par 3 17th dubbed the Fortress is anything but a misnomer. The 231 yard hole is fortified by an elevated green, a watery moat on the left and three deep sand bunkers surrounding the green. The only Trojan Horse is a well struck fairway wood. Locals call this hole the easiest par 4 in Decatur.
