The 65,000-GRT ship will make the Company’s maiden call in China’s biggest megalopolis after a 60-day round-the-world Grand Voyage via Europe which departs on 3 March 2016 from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nGianni Onorato, MSC Cruises CEO declared: “We are delighted to once more be able to offer our guests a brand new itinerary – from Brazil to China via Europe – which offers the chance to visit some of the most appealing places on earth, certainly across a huge array of people and cultures.”\nMr Onorato added: “This new Grand Voyage offering is proof of our steadfast commitment to offer our experienced guests and holiday-makers innovative and sought-after destinations. As MSC Cruises continues to expand the destinations it calls – such as Cuba that we recently announced – we are further enhancing our global offering while providing travellers best-in-class experiences and service.”\nThree different versions of the Grand Voyage, with Shanghai as final destination, will be offered to cruise lovers and eager travellers from 21 August 2015. MSC Cruises’ guests will have the opportunity to depart from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Genoa in Italy or Dubai in the UAE.\nMSC Cruises has a broad range of itineraries on offer to meet the demand from cruisers around the world from short three night-breaks to standard seven-night journeys but also cruises of 11 to 14 nights, as well as an extensive Grand Voyage offering which includes journeys from Europe to South America, the Antilles and Caribbean, to South Africa or Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the Emirates and back. This new offer of back-to-back Grand Voyages from South America to China via Europe highlights MSC Cruises’ vast offering beyond its core leadership in Europe and the Mediterranean. Indeed, MSC Cruises also offers cruises in the Caribbean, the French Antilles and other sought-after locations around the world from Northern Europe to Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Oman.\nAdditionally, earlier this month MSC Cruises made the headlines when it announced that, as of December 2015, it will be the first global cruise line to offer travellers the opportunity to visit Cuba and set sail on one of the 16 cruises that MSC Opera will operate from Havana.\nBefore setting sail, MSC Lirica will have been fully renovated and enlarged under the Renaissance Programme, which entails a comprehensive overhaul programme due to be completed in November 2015.\nSource:-MSC Cruises", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T06:14:28.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
