I really rate him as a player. The switch has been flicked and we’re both playing at the other end of the ground and potentially on Saturday afternoon at the MCG.\n“That’d be really exciting for me. On a personal level, we’ve been through a lot together this year and in the short time I’ve been at the club.”\nJarryd Blair and Ben Sinclair were also recalled by the Magpies while key defender Jonathon Marsh was named to make his debut.\nBen Reid and Darcy Moore oppose each other at training on Thursday. Picture: Wayne Ludbey Source: News Corp Australia\nSam Dwyer, Jarrod Witts and Paul Seedsman were omitted from the side that lost to Melbourne, while youngster Jordan De Goey was rested.\nThe Magpies are looking to arrest a six-game losing streak on Saturday, with Moore saying Thursday’s training session was “the best (they) have had all year”.\nHe says they have left last Saturday’s loss to Melbourne behind and are looking to finally turn their fortunes tomorrow, hopefully allowing him to draw on his singing voice for the first time since being drafted as a father-son pick at the end of last season.\n“The sentimental part of me obviously wants to sing the song for the first time and I’ve worn the stripes now four times and haven’t been able to get the four points, so it’s pretty disappointing,” he said.\n“It won’t be at the forefront of my mind until after the game and I’ll get to share that experience, hopefully, with my teammates. Until then, we’ll just be focusing on the process we need to get that result.\n“You can dwell on (the losing streak) … but the reality is we’ve got another opportunity on Saturday against our old rivals the Blues.”\nOriginally published as Moore, Reid to form two-pronged attack", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/ben-reid-to-return-for-collingwood-against-carlton-and-partner-darcy-moore-up-forward/story-fni5f6hd-1227472561095", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/08/06/1227473/213355-9ed26198-3c26-11e5-8ba6-37d94aa5cd16.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-07T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T14:10:22.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
